   Two striking Greyhound drivers have been
arrested by federal agents and charged with firing shots at a
Greyhound bus last month in Illinois.
   Roy B. Simes, 35, and Harry T. Lewis, 42, both of suburban St.
Louis, were scheduled to appear this afternoon before a U.S.
magistrate in St. Louis who will determine whether they should be
sent to Illinois to face federal charges filed Tuesday in East St.
Louis federal court. They were being held without bond.
   The charges were in connection with a March 22 shooting of a bus
in Collinsville, Ill., just across the state line from St. Louis.
Authorities said Simes and Lewis were also considered suspects in
another bus shooting in Missouri the same day, but no charges were
immediately filed in that incident.
   The two were charged with endangering people on board a vehicle
used in interstate or foreign commerce, commission of a felony with
a firearm that has been transported in interstate commerce and use
of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.
   If convicted, Simes and Lewis could face up to 10 years in jail
and a $10,000 fine. Using a firearm during the commission of a
felony carries a mandatory five-year jail term.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms announced
last week it was investigating the more than 30 Greyhound shootings
that have occurred since 6,300 drivers and 3,000 other workers
walked off the job March 2 over wages and job security.
   The men's arrests Tuesday were the second and third nationwide
since a series of shootings involving Greyhound buses began last
month. The other arrest took place March 16, when a striking driver
was accused of shooting at a bus on March 12 near Hartford, Conn.
   Simes admitted he and Lewis were involved in the March 22
shootings involving a bus in Collinsville and one traveling on
Interstate 55 about 12 miles south of St. Louis, Stephen Higgins of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said in a sworn
statement. The statement said Simes also consented to a search of
his residence and turned over a .22-caliber revolver.
   No one was hurt in either shooting incident.
   Simes has been a Greyhound driver for 12 years and Lewis for 10
years, according to the court documents filed in East St. Louis.
   On Monday, Greyhound Lines Inc. filed a $30 million civil
racketeering suit against the union in a Jacksonville, Fla., court,
near the site of a previous sniping incident in which seven
passengers were injured, two seriously.
