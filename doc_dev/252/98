   This financially troubled city sued
a judge who gave away City Hall to pay a debt, but the new owner's
lawyer says the property's already been sold.
   The suit, filed Friday in federal court, seeks to reverse the
Sept. 27 county circuit court ruling awarding City Hall and some
other city land to the guardians of a man who won a $3.4 million
judgment after being injured in the city jail.
   Mayor Carl Officer contends in the $125 million lawsuit that the
ruling by St. Clair County Circuit Judge Roger Scrivner was part of
a pattern of racism against the predominantly black city. The mayor
also called for a U.S. Senate investigation of the circuit court.
   The mayor's suit, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the
people of East St. Louis, alleged the circuit court ``has engaged
in a pattern and practice of racially motivated conduct that has
deprived the city of East St. Louis and its citizens of due process
of law.''
   The mayor also asked the circuit court to reconsider Scrivner's
decision and bar him from handling other cases involving the city,
said City Attorney Eric Vickers
   Scrivner awarded City Hall and a piece of city-owned industrial
property to Walter DeBow, 55, who suffered permanent brain damage
after being beaten into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city
jail more than six years ago. DeBow has no short-term memory and is
being cared for at a head-injury rehabilitation center in New
Jersey.
   Calls for comment to Scrivner and the chief judge of the court
weren't returned Friday.
   DeBow's attorney, Clyde Kuehn, said Friday he'd already made a
deal to sell City Hall. He refused to name the prospective buyer or
give the price.
   Kuehn said Scrivner's ruling was the only way to get the city to
pay its debt to DeBow - about $4 million because of interest.
   ``The rights that were enforced in circuit court were the rights
of a black man, and a good guy too,'' said attorney Clyde Kuehn,
referring to the allegation of racism. ``You can win a $4 million
verdict, but you don't win until they pay.''
   DeBow, who was in jail on charges of illegally transporting
alcohol when the beating occurred, needs the money to pay for his
$325-per-day care, his family said.
   The city's lawsuit seeks $25 million in actual damages and $100
million in punitive damages.
   The St. Clair County Recorder of Deeds said Friday the property
was placed in a trust Oct. 1, with Eric Rhein as guardian. A phone
call to Rhein's Belleville law office was not immediately returned.
   City Hall is worth about $10 million, Vickers has said. And city
officials had been negotiating with a company to buy the other
piece of property for $5 million to build a trash recycling plant.
   East St. Louis is plagued by debt estimated at $47 million. Gov.
James R. Thompson signed a $34 million bailout bill Aug. 30. The
money will come from state bond issues.
   The population of the city, which has one of the nation's
highest murder rates, fell from 55,000 in 1980 to 40,000 this year,
the Census Bureau estimates.
   Selling the property rids DeBow of responsibility for paying
property taxes, which could be as high as $400,000 annually on City
Hall alone, Kuehn said Thursday.
   It also eliminates potential liability for injuries on the
property, he said.
