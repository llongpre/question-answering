   Missouri voters, unreceptive to more
government, rejected a new agency to oversee state waterways and
ousted 14 state legislators.
   Republican U.S. Rep. Jack Buechner was trailing by 52 votes
early today in his bid for a third term. The state's eight other
congressmen won re-election.
   The Natural Streams Act, criticized as a bureaucratic land grab,
was rejected by 75 percent of the voters. The act would have
created a state commission for governing 52 scenic waterways.
   Kansas City voters approved limiting City Council members to two
four-year terms, while a non-binding St. Louis County vote opposed
federal dioxin burning in Times Beach.
   Republican State Auditor Margaret Kelly eased to a second
four-year term, beating Democratic novice Connie Hendren in the
only statewide race on Tuesday.
   Buechner trailed Democrat Joan Kelly Horn by 52 votes out of
188,548 cast in St. Louis and St. Charles counties. Buechner noted
that some absentee ballots might not be counted for days.
   Buechner was talking to lawyers about a recount, ``which is
mandatory when the difference is less than 1 percent.''
   ``Missouri seems to have been swept by a wave of
anti-incumbency,'' said Buechner, a suburban St. Louis congressman.
