<LEADPARA>  In the world of classic steam locomotives, age has its privileges.;    After
16 years of working and planning by hundreds of volunteers, old Engine No.
2472 -- all 271 tons of it -- was late for its own coming-out-of-retirement
party.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But no one scurrying to finish its epic restoration at Hunters Point Naval
Shipyard on Tuesday was sore at the hissing black beast.;    No, as in all
cases of love, the volunteers simply understood.;    After all, the
70-year-old locomotive hadn't fired up since it retired from Southern
Pacific's Peninsula commute service in 1957. Demanding that it leave the
shipyard on cue would have been like asking Ginger Rogers to dance a little
faster or asking Walter Cronkite to speak up or asking Lou Brock to come out
of the stands and steal his base-stealing record back from Rickey Henderson.; 
  "You get up next to that thing, and there's something magical about the
machine," said Mike Mangini, a Redwood City pharmacist who rescued the engine
from the San Mateo County Fairgrounds in 1975. "It's like it's alive.";   
Volunteers racing to finish rebuilding the engine Tuesday rejoiced in the
knowledge that the house-high Baldwin locomotive is expected to chug down the
Peninsula from South San Francisco this morning beginning at 10:30. The engine
will run down the CalTrain line, traveling through stations at Burlingame,
Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara and College Park, before
making a turn to head up the east side of the bay to Oakland. From there, it
will go on to Railfair '91, a huge railroad exposition set to begin this
weekend in Sacramento. If all goes well, South Bay residents can view the
train at the College Park stop around 12:30 p.m.;    The trip to Sacramento
will be the victory lap of a project that many said was crazy back when
Mangini persuaded San Mateo County to let him refurbish the engine that during
the 1920s pulled a segment of the Overland Limited, a Chicago-to-San Francisco
line.;    "We never gave up," said Doug Debs, an electrical engineer from Palo
Alto who joined the project in 1979. "If we knew how much work it was going to
be, I don't know that we would have started it.";    In the beginning, a
handful of volunteers worked at the fairgrounds every other weekend. Progress
was slow and discouraging.;    "It was literally rusting faster than we could
put it together," Debs said.;    Then, a year and a half ago they moved to a
gigantic garage that was served by railroad tracks at Hunters Point. After six
months of cleaning up trash and junked parts at the base, the group kicked
into high gear. For the past month and a half, crews have worked seven days a
week -- including some all-night shifts in recent days.;    They've
transformed the rusting hulk into a gorgeous jet black engine, with Southern
Pacific orange trim. On Tuesday morning, the numbers 2472 shone on its side
and the huge rods that push the 6-foot-high wheels glistened when the sun hit
them right. Steam puffed out of its side and a small fire glowed in the
furnace in the cab.;    The plan was for No. 2472 to pull out of Hunters Point
at noon. It would spend the night at the South San Francisco yard before
heading south and around the bay to Sacramento.;    But when you're 70 years
old, you don't go anywhere before you're ready. And No. 2472 wasn't ready at
noon.;    Workers fretted all morning over a troublesome steam pipe that was
leaking again. By late morning several tests still needed to be run on the
boiler and workers had conceded this train wouldn't be running on time.;   
Still, an old friend, Neil Vodden of Scotts Valley, stood by. Vodden made the
acquaintance of No. 2472 in 1944 when he started working for the Southern
Pacific. In his 44 years as a fireman and engineer with the railroad, he had
driven the old locomotive up and down the Peninsula many times. He will drive
it again when it's ready to leave for Sacramento.;    Vodden, 65, and the
machine greeted each other the way old friends sometimes do. Vodden at first
said it would be no big deal to be at the controls of No. 2472 again. But of
course, he didn't mean it.;    "I'll admit it's kind of special," he said
after some thought. "It's going to be kind of a kick."  </TEXT>
