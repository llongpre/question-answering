   The National Transportation Safety Board formally cited a Consolidated Rail Corp. engineer's use of marijuana as a prime cause of the Jan. 4, 1987, collision of an Amtrak passenger train and a string of Conrail locomotives near Baltimore. 

   The safety board, in its official determination of the causes of the crash that killed 16 persons and injured more than 170, also decided that Amtrak's failure to require automatic train controls on the high-speed Northeast corridor, and Conrail's failure to use that safety backup system, helped cause the wreck. 

   The agency issued several recommendations, such as having Amtrak instruct its train dispatchers to avoid placing any trains that aren't equipped with automatic control in potential conflict with passenger trains at track intersections on the corridor. 
Amtrak owns the Boston-Washington corridor, where the collision occurred. 

   Among other recommendations, the safety board urged Amtrak to expand supervision of the corridor train operations to include mandatory speed- and signal-compliance checks and regular fitness checks of certain crew members. 
Conrail was urged to expedite installation of automatic train-control devices on its locomotive fleet and to improve methods of spotting employee alcohol and drug abuse. 

   The board also recommended that the Federal Railroad Administration intensify its monitoring of Amtrak compliance with federal safety rules, including requirements for post-crash testing of employees for the presence of alcohol or drugs. 

   Investigators have said that blood and urine tests on the Conrail engineer and a fireman showed evidence of marijuana, and that they sped through "slow" and "stop" signals into the path of the Amtrak train bound for New York from here. 

   An Amtrak spokeswoman said that soon after the accident, Amtrak made many operating changes, including imposing speed restrictions on any train without automatic controls. 
The Federal Railroad Administration has ordered installation by mid-1990 of automatic controls on all trains operating on the high-speed track. 

   John Riley, that agency's administrator, said in an interview he generally agrees with the safety board findings, but added that they don't go far enough. 
His agency needs safety board backing in its quest for laws giving it authority to require random drug testing of rail operating crews and to discipline workers for actions such as disabling warning and other safety devices, he said. 

   Had the Conrail warning device been working, the crew would have seen the need to stop sooner, probably averting the crash, Mr. Riley said. 
As it was, he said, they tried to stop, but were too late.
