   A railroad track abandoned 21 years ago
will carry paying passengers again beginning Monday with restoration
of service to Grand Canyon National Park.
   The 64-mile Grand Canyon Railway, originally a spur serving
people crossing the high country of northern Arizona on the Santa Fe
railroad, will carry tourists arriving in this town of 2,500 on
Interstate 40, which largely replaced old U.S. 66.
   The developers hope the romance of their steam locomotives and
the scenery along the tracks will persuade tourists to park their
cars and pay the fare rather than drive to the canyon. Fars for the
round trip will be $37 for adults and $21 for children under 12.
   A ceremonial trip for public officials and other railroad guests
was scheduled Sunday, the 88th anniversary of the first passenger
service on the original line.
   The rail line passes through dramatic scenery, including
ponderosa pine forests near Williams, the sparse plains of the high
plateau and steep canyons near the northern terminus, in Grand
Canyon Village only 200 yards from the Grand Canyon's South Rim.
   Grand Canyon National Park spokesman Chuck Lundy said train
travel could help the environment of the South Rim, visited by
810,000 private vehicles and 3{ million people last year.
   A Northern Arizona University study found that enough people
would opt for a train ride to the canyon to reduce road traffic by
41 percent, Lundy said.
   ``We don't see the train as being our solution, but we do see it
as one ingredient, one element of that solution. We're very
supportive and pleased that the railroad is returning,'' he said.
   Part of the $85 million project cost has gone to collect and
restore enough locomotives and passenger cars to accommodate a
projected 135,000 passengers next year. Some has been spent to
replace rails and 30,000 weather-worn ties.
   The railroad is the brainchild of Max Biegert, an engineer who
owns a commercial aviation company in Chandler.
   Biegert wound up holding title to 22 miles of track along the
line after a developer defaulted on a loan. He hired Roth as a
consultant, and they put together an investment package which raised
$15 million to organize the company and buy land.
   The company has purchased four locomotives and 29 coach cars
built by the Pullman Co., which have been repainted original Pullman
green, said spokeswoman Kathleen Boyd.
