   The whistle of steam locomotives has
returned to the South Rim, and officials say it could usher in a
cleaner era at the crowded Grand Canyon overlook.
   The Grand Canyon Railway was to haul its first paying passengers
today over the 64 miles from Williams to the South Rim, 88 years
after the first train chugged over the sinous route leading from
pine forests to the blood-red sandstone of the canyon.
   The railway, which resumed its run Sunday, restores service that
was ended in 1968; since then most of the 3.5 million annual
visitors to the rim have arrived by automobile.
   The railroad plans weekend service until November and daily
service next year, using only steam locomotives over a route that
the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad considered the toughest
on its system when it was completed in 1901.
   The railway plans to build a 400-room hotel, a
turn-of-the-century theme park and an American Indian cultural
center in Williams and later build a hotel near the Grand Canyon
airport at Tusayan, 10 miles south of the South Rim.
   An hourly train shuttle from the airport to the rim should reduce
pollution, said Max Biegert, the railroad's developer. A recent
Northern Arizona University study predicted that train ridership
could reduce motor traffic to the rim by 40 percent.
   Biegert said he expects the line to carry 135,000 passengers next
year and up to 500,000 annually in years to come, providing jobs for
about 800 people.
   On Sunday's inaugural ride, about 500 people including Gov. Rose
Mofford rode aboard seven 80-foot-long Harriman Coach cars that
recalled the glamor of turn-of-the-century railroading.
   Mofford hailed the development as an economic boost to the
northern Arizona, while Eugene Hughes, the president of Northern
Arizona University in nearby Flagstaff, waxed sentimental.
   ``As a child my visions of exotic travel were always likened to
the railroads,'' he said.``In an era of jet lag and frenetic
freeways, it's nice to know that a person can slow down the pace of
things to what they used to be.''
   The Williams depot, a teal-gray, one-story addition to the
historic Fray Marcos Hotel, was bedecked with red-white-and-blue
bunting.
   People turned out in traditional Old West garb: the women in
gingham dresses and men in vests, neckerchiefs and canvas breeches
called ``duckins.'' The trip began in part of the nation's largest
stand of ponderosa pine, moved past the cones of dormant volcanoes
and onto the austere plains of the Colorado Plateau, ending with a
series of switchbacks.
   At the northern terminus, only 200 yards from the rim, the
passengers took part in a spike-driving ceremony and briefly viewed
the canyon before the return trip.
   Planners believe the railroad, an entirely private venture, will
encourage people to spend more time studying and hiking in the
canyon rather than gazing off the rim.
