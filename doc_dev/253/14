   It took two tries, but a 104-ton steam
locomotive built in China and destined for Iowa was hoisted out of
a cargo ship after it was dropped and slightly damaged during a
test lift.
   The new locomotive, the last steamer manufactured at the Datong
Engine Works in China, was unloaded from the cargo hold Wednesday
and was to be transferred to a rail flat car within two days for
shipment to Boone, Iowa, as a tourist attraction, officials said.
   The first attempt to lift the locomotive with the ship's crane
backfired Tuesday when the engine dropped a few inches, slightly
damaging the cab, said Dean Briley, a board member of the Boone &amp;
Scenic Valley Railroad, which bought the locomotive for $355,000.
   Workers succeeded the following day using a barge crane, Briley
said.
