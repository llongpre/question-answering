CREWE, Cheshire: the railway junction epitomised. It is 9am on a grey
Saturday and people are gathering in knots at the ends of the bleak station
platforms, shifting listlessly from foot to foot.
Like others, they are waiting for trains. But two things tell you these are
no ordinary passengers. As they peer down the line at an approaching speck
on the horizon, they exclaim: 'It's a siphon]' 'It's a double-header]' or
'It's an 87]'. And when the speck becomes a train, pulls into the station,
and pulls out again, it goes without them: they remain on the platform,
waiting for the next speck to appear.
These people are train spotters. No one is quite sure exactly why they do
what they do, but Crewe is where they like to do it. As one of the busiest
main line junctions in Britain, it draws rail enthusiasts from across the
country. Young and old, rich and poor, they are united by their anoraks,
their multi-coloured Biros, and a near-total inability to find a convincing
explanation for their behaviour.
History does not relate how trainspotting started, but the Victorian
engineer George Stephenson must bear part of the blame. When he put the
first engine into service on the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway in 1825, he
not only gave it a name - Locomotion - but also labelled it No. 1. Once
numbers had become established as the accepted method of marking railway
engines, it was arguably only a matter of time before someone yielded to the
compulsion to start writing them down.
Even so, the hobby might hardly have progressed had it not been for a man
named Ian Allan. While working as a junior clerk for the pre-nationalisation
Southern Railway during the second world war, Allan found himself beset with
requests for details of the company's engines. So in 1942, he won permission
from the Southern to publish a list of them under the title abc of Southern
Locomotives. The book was a runaway success. A trainspotting publishing
empire was born.
In the immediate post-war era trainspotting remained an unsophisticated
hobby, consisting mainly of ticking off numbers in the Ian Allan books as
locomotives were seen. The pastime looked in danger of dying out in the
1960s when steam engines started giving way to a much smaller fleet of
humdrum diesel and electric locomotives. But today's adherents are tackling
the hobby with a degree of dedication that puts earlier exponents in the
shade.
Railway book publishing, for example, has expanded to cater for every
proclivity: titles on offer include Locomotive Boiler Explosions by CH
Hewison, Great Western Engine Sheds 1837-1947 by E. Lyons &amp; E. Mountford,
and Searching for Railway Telegraph Insulators by WK Neal.
Modern technology, too, has added a new dimension to the hobby. Nowadays,
the notebook and Biro is not enough: serious spotters carry micro-cassette
recorders or camcorders to record locomotive sightings. Back home, they
enact the role of the engine driver by watching pre-recorded videos of train
journeys shot from the driver's cab, or plan the next day's spotting by
dialling an 0898 telephone number for details of interesting traffic
movements.
For those with home computers, one railway magazine advertiser offers a disk
that contains all UK locomotive numbers and allows users to add their
spotting notes and comments. Another offers a programme simulating the
operation of Leicester signalbox. ('Full colour on-screen track diagram . .
. you control all traffic movements . . . wide variety of passenger and
freight workings.') A third offers a souped-up signalbox simulation
incorporating random train delays. ('Even more realistic,' the advertisement
justifiably claims.)
Meanwhile, the vocabulary of trainspotting has changed with the times. Steam
enthusiasts always had affectionate nicknames for different locomotive
types: 'crabs', 'semis', 'spam cans' and so on. Now a new set of names,
similarly obscure in origin, has sprung up for today's diesels and
electrics: 'duffs', 'spoons', 'hoovers', 'siphons', 'goyles' and 'rats'.
Spotters themselves have long been known as 'gricers' - according to one
theory, after a champion spotter named Richard Grice. But beneath this
general heading, sub-heads have appeared. 'Number crunchers' collect
anything with a number on it, including carriages and wagons; 'bashers'
specialise in riding trains hauled by different locomotives; and 'track
bashers' collect trips on different sections of line.
At Crewe, you tend to get a relatively normal sort of spotter: the bashers,
after all, are out there riding the trains. So this seems as good a place as
any to seek an answer to that most enduring of life's mysteries: just what
makes train spotters do it?
Out at the south end of platform 6 stands a middle-aged man in blue anorak,
blue jeans, flat cap and - oddly, given the overcast sky - dark glasses. He
declines to give his name ('I'm anonymous; that's the way I am') but admits
to being a bookkeeper for a tank storage depot in Birkenhead.
'I have never lost the ability to stand at the end of a platform for six or
seven hours at a time,' he says. 'My philosophy is that it's important to
have a hobby in life. I feel sorry for people who jeer at us and have
nothing of their own.'
Well, a hobby, yes. But why trainspotting?
'There is infinite variety in the railway scene. Engines are chameleon-like.
People complain that some of them are 30 years old, but they're always being
renumbered, repainted or rebuilt . . . ' He is distracted by a movement of
rolling stock further up the tracks.
'Yes, there is always the unexpected in this hobby . . . seeing something in
an unusual location . . . you never know what's going to happen.' Then,
suddenly: 'There] Look at that] A Network SouthEast loco coming out of the
siding]' He whips out a pair of binoculars, clasps them to his eyes, and
feverishly writes down the number. 'There you've got it, you see - a whole
panoply of change.'
Nearby, 13-year-old Liam White from Warrington - grey anorak, blue jeans,
red hair and freckles - has identified an approaching speck as a class 87
electric loco hauling a northbound express. He knows it is a class 87
because he can make out two windows on the front of the cab. Three windows,
and it would be a class 86.
'I've been doing it for five months,' he says. 'Me and a friend, we're
seeing who can get the most numbers. I've got two more than him - nearly
1,000. We usually go to Warrington Bank Quay, but I've come down here to get
some more.'
But what is to stop his friend just crossing off a few numbers while Liam's
back is turned?
'That'd be cheating, if he crossed one off.'
So?
'Well, if he crossed off 58020 I could say to him: 'You can't have seen that
because it wouldn't have gone through Bank Quay'.'
But couldn't he claim it was passing through the station on an, er, unusual
working?
'No. It's too big.'
Down the other end of the platform, 30-year-old Ray Cavanagh - blue anorak,
blue jeans, a storekeeper from Birkenhead - has a camera round his neck.
'Some people take numbers, I take pictures,' he says. His attention is
caught by an approaching rumble. 'I'll just take a picture of this. I'll be
back.'
The rumble is a trainload of several hundred enthusiasts being hauled by a
class 37 diesel locomotive from Bristol to Holyhead and back. The weather is
chilly but because the engine is a goods locomotive, it is not fitted with
train heating equipment. It would not make any difference if it was, because
all the windows are open so that the passengers can lean out and listen to
the engine.
Ray takes a photograph, then returns to explain the lure of spotting. 'It's
good fun travelling around and seeing places you haven't seen before. You
meet interesting people, and you can tell them what you've seen, and they
can tell you what they've seen.' Then, perhaps aware that all this may sound
a bit lame: 'Personally, I could never understand the attraction of sitting
on a riverbank for hours on end waiting for something to grab your hook.'
This is a common response among train spotters. Unable to rationalise their
obsession, they tend to fall back on the excuse that is no worse than doing
something else. Hence, when a spotter on platform 5, a civil engineer named
Keith Slaney, is asked what his wife thinks of his continual absences on
spotting excursions, he says: 'I think she'd rather it was trains than
another woman.'
Keith is one of a dozen or so representatives of the West Yorkshire branch
of the Rail Correspondence &amp; Travel Society, apparently a club for people
who cannot help wearing anoraks. Interestingly, today's outing includes two
women, both with their husbands. 'It's like everything else: you either let
them go their own way and get on with it, or go with them and enjoy it,'
says one, Sue Coville.
The day seems to have settled into a lunch-time lull, and one club member
has staggered back from the chip shop with chips for everyone. Sue and
husband Gordon, a buyer for a textile company, embark on the story of how
they once set out in their car for an all-night trainspotting session beside
the tracks at Shap, a summit in Cumbria. On arrival, they found that the
engine numbers were invisible in the dark. They hit on the idea of pointing
their car at the tracks and, when a train approached, bathing it in light
with their headlamps. This worked well until an engine driver who had
undergone illumination reported the incident to the police. Later that
night, Sue and Gordon were interrupted by a rap on the car roof from a
constable. 'But luckily, he turned out to be an enthusiast too, so he
understood.'
Further down platform 5, 28-year-old Richard Smith from Leicestershire
appears to be wearing a green anorak, but on closer inspection it turns out
to be a waxed cotton jacket. Is this a spotter with a difference? 'I'm a
closet spotter, really,' he says. 'People think all spotters are prats, and
quite a lot of them are: there are some right plonkers around. I work in a
bank, but I don't tell people there I do it.'
Richard says he caught the spotting habit from his father. He has already
seen all 17,115 of British Rail's locomotives and passenger vehicles and is
now on his second time round. 'If you've got an interest in railway trains
and you are going out to see them, you might as well write their numbers
down.'
Is he absolutely sure?
'Well, to tell you the truth, it is a bit boring. But if I wasn't doing this
I'd only be stuck at home or doing the shopping or something.'
It's the same old story: it is better than doing something else. Clearly, no
amount of time at Crewe will explain what makes spotters spot. And so we
turn to the father of modern trainspotting himself - Ian Allan, still
running his publishing business in Shepperton, Middlesex, at the age of 70.
According to Allan, the reason for the peculiarly British obsession with
trainspotting is sheer opportunism. In an island as densely populated as
Britain and with such an extensive railway network, no one is very far from
a busy railway line.
'If you go to Clapham Junction (in London) you can see 2,500 trains a day.
It's non-stop entertainment - there is always something going on. But if you
go to a French station and watch a train go past, you might wait six hours
until you see another one. There are nothing like sufficient trains to keep
people's interest going.'
It is plausible, up to a point. But if that were the only explanation, then
everyone in Britain would be a spotter. Surely there must be a more
deep-rooted motivation? Something, perhaps, in the psyche?
'No idea, unless it's a collecting urge,' says Allan. And indeed it is - or
at least partly so, says Dr David Weeks, a clinical psychologist
specialising in the study of eccentric behaviour.
According to Dr Weeks, train spotters fall broadly into two main personality
types. One, the schizoid type, comprises the sort of person who feels ill at
ease socially and prefers the company of inanimate objects. (Examples
include people who develop an unusual degree of interest in activities such
as computing or weight training.) The other, the obsessional type, comprises
those who want everything to be perfect, tidy, neat and clean - among them,
the collectors of stamps or china and spotters of aircraft or birds, for all
of whom an incomplete set of objects represents an imperfect set.
These personality traits, alone or in combination, are found in quite
sizeable chunks of the population, says Weeks. They may express themselves
in behavioural oddities such as fanatical enthusiasm for an obscure rock
group or a losing football team, or in sexual terms, through an obsession
with high heels or underwear. But there is no reason to be concerned about
the traits unless they are taken to extremes, Weeks emphasises. 'The vast
majority of train spotters are perfectly normal and reasonable people.'
This is, of course, nonsense: we all know that train spotters are unhinged.
And yet, just one day at Crewe has shown how short a time it can take to see
a considerable number of trains. Let's see now . . . a couple more visits
would probably enough to finish off the class 87s: after that, there would
only be another 2,432 locomotives, 14,648 carriages and 28,884 wagons to go
. . .
