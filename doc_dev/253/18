   Except for the white hair, it could have
been railroad entrepreneur Leland Stanford standing between
steam-belching locomotives Wednesday driving in a gold spike that
bound the nation together by rail.
   Like Stanford 120 years ago, actor Sam Gordon missed on his
first swing with the sledge. So did the actorportraying Union
Pacific's Thomas Durant.
   ``They were totally inebriated as far as we know,'' said John
Stewart, a Utah State University historian and frock-coated member
of the local troupe that annually re-enacts the makeshift ceremony.
   Nearly 2,000 people gathered at this spot near the Great Salt
Lake to watch giant steam locomotives come face to face as they did
May 10, 1869.
   Gordon, nearly 80 and a teetotaler, has played Stanford since
1961 and co-directs the 18-member cast. He apologized for his
snow-white mane.
   ``I feel kind of bad because Leland Stanford had black hair''
and was 45 at the time, Gordon said. ``I thought it was OK because
Leland got older, too.''
   Once the ceremonial spikes were placed, another sledge and
spike, both attached to the telegraph wire, were used to alert a
waiting nation that the 1,776-mile line was finished.
   ``The last rail is laid! The last spike is driven! The Pacific
Railroad is completed!'' read the telegram from Durant and Stanford
to President Ulysses S. Grant.
   Stanford was a former governor of California and president of
the Central Pacific Railroad. He later represented California in
the U.S. Senate.
   A bottle of champagne was broken over the ceremonial tie and
Central Pacific's ``Jupiter'' engine and Union Pacific's ``119''
were driven over it. After the ceremonial tie was removed _ it
burned in the San Francisco fire of 1906 _ historians believe an
unknown Chinese worker probably drove the last steel spike into a
wooden tie.
   If so, it was only fitting.
   Using up to 400 kegs of blasting powder a day, some 12,000
Chinese immigrants labored dawn to dusk for about $30 a month
without board to carve a rail bed out of the granite of the Sierras.
   It took them more than a year to bore a 1,650-foot tunnel at
Donner's Summit, four years to pound the 690 miles from Sacramento,
Calif., to this sagebrush-dotted valley which has been home to the
Golden Spike National Historic Site since 1969.
   Occasionally, National Park Service employees find shards of
broken rice bowls and brass opium boxes furnished to the workers by
the railroad.
   ``It was their way of keeping them happy,'' said Park Service
engineer Bob Dowty.
   Two weeks before the rails merged in 1869, the Central Pacific
crews had laid a record 10 miles and 56 feet of track in a single
day.
   Durant's Union Pacific crews, made up largely of ex-soldiers of
the Union and Confederacy and young Irish and German immigrants,
hammered 1,086 miles over the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains from
the Missouri River, frequently braving Indian attack.
   The rail link was completed six years ahead of schedule at an
estimated cost of $500 million.
   ``The minute that spike was driven, you changed six months from
Omaha to Sacramento to six days,'' Dowty said.
   Historians generally agree that the mammoth enterprise that grew
out of the Pacific Railroad Act, signed by Abraham Lincoln in 1862,
was the single most significant reason for the rapid settlement of
America west of the Mississippi during the late 19th century.
   Wednesday's re-enactment was the 10th involving two
black-red-and-gold, full-sized replicas of the eastbound Jupiter
and westbound 119. The locomotives cost $750,000 each and were the
first steam engines built in the United States in a quarter century.
