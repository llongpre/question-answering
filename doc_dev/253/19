FT  18 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Railway run on private lines

STROLLING through the Wyre forest any day in summer you can hear a regular,
insistent 'hoot' breezing on the wind through the larch and sycamore trees.
It is not a tawny owl or wood pigeon. In fact, the hoot is more of a 'toot',
a deep-throated whistle from the steam locomotives chugging along the nearby
line of the Severn Valley Railway.
The SVR is Britain's largest privately-owned railway company measured by
turnover and assets. On Tuesday, the UK Government outlined plans to
partially privatise British Rail, but, unlike the SVR, none of the private
train operators would run a complete railway.
As general manager, Michael Draper has run this small company for 16 years.
On his shoulders and those of his colleagues rests the task of balancing a
culture of profit-making with those of preserving a chunk of British history
Draper calls a 'Grade 2 listed business'. It also allows him to judge the
plans for BR. Even for the limited franchising-off of routes, Draper is
deeply sceptical, believing it will erode Britain's rail service.
The 16-mile stretch of track between Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and
Bridgnorth, Shropshire, was axed by Beeching in the 1960s. It was re-opened
in two stages by the SVR and the first train ran in 1970. The company owns
27 steam and six diesel locomotives, 70 carriages and a range of freight
waggons, steam cranes, brake vans and other rolling stock. The track, for
which it owns the freehold, is dotted with six pretty brick stations.
Festooned in hanging flower baskets, the stations display old advertising
hoardings redolent of an era of black- and-white movies and day trips to the
seaside. New Hudson Cycles (Pounds 8.10s. 0d), Park Drive cigarettes (10 for
2d), John Bull - the long service tyre, Quibell's Sheep Dip.
That is all fun for day-trippers but the SVR is a proper transport business,
running regular daily services between the two towns for six months of the
year and weekend operations for 10 months. On Sundays, up to ten timetabled
services, as well as a host of specials, clank through the wooded valley of
the Severn.
The company employs 50 full-time staff and generated a turnover of Pounds
2.4m last year, on which it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 35,000. That is
not a sign that the SVR is heading for the buffers. This was its first loss
for 15 years, reflecting the recession which cut passengers by 16,000 to
198,000. The SVR says this is still the second largest volume among
Britain's 15 or so steam railways after the North Yorkshire Moors.
Of its turnover, about Pounds 1m comes from traffic receipts. Bars make
Pounds 400,000, gift shops Pounds 360,000 and catering Pounds 240,000. A
directors' board of 12, chaired by David Owen, of the Rubery Owen motor
components group, oversees the SVR. A bank overdraft and a bank loan of
Pounds 250,000 - to be paid off next year - help keep the SVR on the rails.
But its main outside funding derives from three share issues in the 1970s
and 1980s, which raised over Pounds 1m. Some 15,000, people hold shares, the
dividend is paid solely in SVR tickets.
When Draper, who once worked for his family's plastics business, lists the
'upsides' of the SVR, this support is first. 'We have several hundred people
physically involved on the railway as volunteers. We are proud to say that
every guard, inspector, driver, fireman and booking-office clerk is an
unpaid volunteer.'
The SVR displays an almost exaggerated ethic of staff motivation in which
the lure is purely the living of childhood fantasies, even if the task of
the day is sweeping carriages.
No-cost labour is a big advantage. The SVR needs it because of the many
disadvantages of the business. One is its seasonal nature. Some 70 per cent
of receipts come in during the summer and Christmas seasons. The close
season is when money is vacuumed out of the business for repair work to
engines, stations and track.
The railway's infrastructure, mostly built in the 1860s, and with some
ancient rolling stock, drains revenue at a rapid rate. 'It devours cash like
a croc devours fish,' says Draper. 'In a year we will spend Pounds 30,000 on
small building work, Pounds 50,000 on materials alone for the permanent way,
Pounds 100,000 on locos and Pounds 70,000 on coaches. There is a mis-match
between what we should charge to cover this and a gut feeling of what we can
charge.' A round-trip ticket is quite expensive, though, at Pounds 8.90.
Draper's instincts are that of a capitalist, tempered by running what is, in
part, a preservation society. 'We do not want to delude ourselves that we do
not need to make a return. I don't want to forget all normal financial
considerations. But if the operation was starved while a lot of money was
paid out to large shareholders there would be a culture clash. The minute
volunteers thought I was taking them for a corporate ride we would have
mayhem. They all identify now with us making a profit but I've also become
subverted by the system. I've become a lover of railways.'
That brings Draper back to the privatising of BR. 'I've believed in private
enterprise all my life,' he says. 'Yet I make a clear distinction between
what perhaps should be the private sector and what should be the public
sector. The management of BR has been improving on a quantum basis. It
already has competition from the airplane and the coach. Private operators
will simply cherry-pick routes. Richard Branson might want the 10am service
from London to Newcastle but he won't want the 12 o'clock or the 2pm. You
will dilute BR and then how can it generate enough energy and resources to
compete with services already competing against it?'
