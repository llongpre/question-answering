   A few years ago, Richard D. Sanborn, as president of a CSX Corp. railroad unit, offered to pay certain shipping brokers more if they would send all their business to CSX. 

   But as Mr. Sanborn recently told executives of Conrail, where he became president earlier this year, the plan backfired. 
Rivals scored with price cuts, and uneasy agents shifted business to other carriers, including Conrail. 
"I tried that one time and got burnt pretty bad," he told the executives, mocking himself and drawing their laughter. 

   There's a method to Mr. Sanborn's self-deprecating style. 
He tells stories of his failures in order to encourage Consolidated Rail Corp. managers to take risks to boost freight business. 
"We aren't going to win them all, but we must try," says the affable, 51-year-old Mr. Sanborn, who is to succeed L. Stanley Crane as chairman and chief executive officer Jan. 1, when Mr. Crane plans to retire. 

   Mr. Sanborn's mission represents a change for Conrail, turned profitable largely through cost-cutting and government spending on track. 
Last year, the Reagan administration sold the government's 85% Conrail stake through a public offering. 
With major opportunities for cost-cutting already exploited, Conrail must seek earnings growth by expanding freight business. 
Attracting new customers will require risks that Conrail has avoided. 

   The entire railroad industry must innovate as shippers increasingly turn to trucks for faster delivery and more flexible service. 
"The competitive environment of the late 1980s and early 1990s will be a very difficult one for railroads," says Bernard La Londe, a transportation professor at Ohio State University. 

   Mr. Sanborn plans to add trains before he has commitments that shippers will use them, and to speed service by avoiding freight yards. 
He wants to explore new businesses, such as operating landfills if that would help Conrail capture a share of fast-growing garbage shipments from New York and New Jersey. 
Mr. Sanborn vows special marketing efforts to win back freight lost to trucks, including coiled steel and food shipments. 

   But the changes he plans may not go far enough to satisfy some analysts. 
They were disappointed when Mr. Sanborn stopped short of promising to diversify Conrail by buying truck companies. 
Instead, he appeared to favor contracts with truckers to extend the railroad's reach. 
"I wish Conrail were going faster," says Henry Livingston, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 

   A Harvard Law School graduate, Mr. Sanborn is fond of train operations. 
As a youngster in Sanbornville, N.H., a hamlet named for one of his forebears, he loved to stand at the grade crossing with the gateman to watch steam trains chug through town. 
He wanted to become a locomotive engineer, but his father practically forced him to go to college, he recalls. 

   He began his railroad industry career in 1961, joining Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, a CSX predecessor, and climbed through the ranks. 
After railroads were partly deregulated in 1980, Mr. Sanborn soon took advantage of new marketing freedoms. 
While at CSX, he launched the Orange Blossom Special, a fast train that brought the railroad back into the business of hauling fruits and vegetables to the Northeast from Florida. 

   Former colleagues say the short, bespectacled Mr. Sanborn, a self-proclaimed Woody Allen look-alike, puts people at ease. 
They also cite his penchant for finding facts firsthand. 
Early in his career, he spent weekends riding in locomotive cabs to learn the railroad's routes. 
While president of CSX Distribution Services last year, he worked for two days as a clerk in the accounting department to find the cause of inaccurate freight bills. 

   Mr. Sanborn "doesn't hesitate to call someone three or four levels down rather than have information filtered up to him," says Charles McCormack, a vice president of CSX/Sea-Land Logistics, a CSX unit. 

   Mr. Sanborn sees his role at Conrail as a catalyst for risk-taking. 
As a government property struggling to turn a profit, "Conrail became more prone to go for the guaranteed piece of business, the sure thing," he says. 
"But we're going to have to be risk tolerant if we're going to push decision making lower down in management and be more responsive to shippers."
