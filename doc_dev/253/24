Photo, Out of Their Element: A turn-of-the-century steam locomotive and a 
replica of a 19th-Century passenger car are hoisted onto tracks Tuesday at the

through the park. The rolling stock will be housed in the 2,300-square-foot 
barn that is under construction at the right in the photo at left. Drawing 
shows the train's path through the park. DAVE GATLEY / Los Angeles Times;
