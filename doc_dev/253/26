   Three unmanned locomotives raced at more
than 80 mph through five towns and across more than 200 miles of
west Texas plains until workers diverted them onto a siding, where
they crashed into a line of empty boxcars, officials said.
   Vandals are suspected of setting the linked Union Pacific diesel
locomotives loose in Big Spring, about 100 miles south of Lubbock,
about 1:30 a.m. Friday. No one was injured.
   ``It couldn't have happened at a better time,'' railroad
spokesman Alex Tice said from company headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
``The line was clear, and there wasn't that much traffic (at
crossings) out at that time of the night.''
   The engines sped through railroad crossings without headlights or
any other warning. The straight track west of Big Spring helped keep
the engines from derailing along the way.
   ``It was moving so fast that it was passing through the crossings
before the signals could be activated,'' said Midland County Deputy
Sheriff Richard Gillette.
   Gillette was driving behind a police car that was almost hit by
the runaway train as it approached a crossing. That apparently was
the closest the locomotives came to hurting anyone as they traveled
214 miles through Big Spring, Midland, Pecos, Toyah and other towns
in western Texas.
   Tice said the 2{-hour odyssey began when someone revved up the
three engines in a rail yard in Big Spring, setting the lead
locomotive at full throttle. He didn't know if the engines had been
left idling, which is often the case.
   The train, which wasn't pulling any cars, ran through two
switches in Big Spring and onto the main line, Tice said.
   The engines were 40 miles down the line before Midland County
authorities alerted Union Pacific officials about the problem.
Gillette said one deputy clocked the train at 67 mph.
   Union Pacific authorities alerted police in counties farther
west, including Gary Ingram of the Reeves County sheriff's office.
   ``When I first heard about it, I thought someone was telling me a
joke,'' Ingram said. ``I told them I might saddle my horse and try
to run it down, but I didn't think it could run that fast. They
didn't find a whole lot of humor in that.''
   From Pecos, the train sped through Toyah at more than 80 mph,
Tice said. Ingram watched the train pass about 1{ miles south of his
ranch in Toyah.
   A Union Pacific employee finally diverted the train onto a siding
near Van Horn, about 125 miles east of El Paso.
   The yellow locomotives, which cost about $1 million each, hit a
line of more than 20 boxcars that had been set on the track. One
boxcar was knocked off the rails by the impact.
   The lead engine skidded onto its side about 250 feet ahead of the
other two locomotives, which remained upright. Tice said the fact
the two engines remained upright indicated the train had slowed for
some reason before the derailment.
   About 500 to 600 feet of track was damaged in the derailment, and
work crews were replacing that section Friday afternoon.
   Union Pacific blamed the incident on vandals, and is offering a
$25,000 reward for information leading to the culprits' arrest and
conviction.
   ``It might have just been a prank by someone who didn't know what
he had gotten into,'' Tice said.
   A second, unrelated railroad accident occurred Friday morning in
San Antonio. In that accident, believed to be caused by human error,
35 boxcars derailed after rolling from a siding onto the main line.
Two employees were treated for injuries, a railroad spokesman said.
