   Two engineers said they squabbled over who
was in charge shortly before their runaway freight train roared
into Montana's capital and caused an explosion that cut off power
to thousands of people.
   The testimony came Wednesday during the first day of a National
Transportation Safety Board hearing into the cause of the Feb. 2
accident, which caused about $10 million in damage. Testimony
continues today.
   The two engineers aboard the 49-car Montana Rail Link train said
they argued over who had authority over the westbound freight.
   Robert Estes was engineer of three ``helper'' engines pulling
the train over a mountain pass; Jody McCloud was engineer of the
train getting the assist.
   When his lead locomotive lost power and its cab heater failed,
Estes said he wanted to stop the train and move another locomotive
in front. McCloud said he offered to operate the train from the
cold, dead locomotive, but Estes said no.
   Estes said he told McCloud: ``It's the principle of the thing.
If anyone will operate this train from this locomotive, it will be
me.''
   In his testimony, McCloud said he opposed Estes' plan to stop
the train and switch locomotives. ``I just said, `I'll run the
train the rest of the way and you can go back and ride in the warm
unit,''' McCloud testified.
   Crewmen were realigning the locomotives when the 49 freight
cars, disconnected from the engines, rolled 11 miles down from the
Continental Divide and collided with other locomotives in Helena.
   Rail cars containing isopropyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide
exploded, shattering windows for miles, severing power lines and
forcing the evacuation of 3,500 residents before dawn in minus-27
degree cold. Fifteen minor injuries were reported.
   An NTSB report cited uncertainty over who was responsible for
decisions on the train.
   ``As a result of the decision to move the engines around, there
was some confusion as to who was in charge of the train,'' the
report said. A final NTSB report on the accident is not expected
until late this year.
