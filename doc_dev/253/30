   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Bruce Gurner has been a schoolteacher,
commercial fisherman, photographer, but what really got into his
blood was railroading. And on one small but famous slice of it _
the last ride of Casey Jones _ he's become the expert of experts.

   WATER VALLEY, Miss. _ The 20th century was not quite four months
old when railroad engineer John Luther ``Casey'' Jones crashed the
Cannon Ball Express into a freight train at Vaughan, Miss., and
became an American folk hero.
   Bruce Gurner had not been born then, but you'd never guess it
listening to him talk, sitting under a shade tree in his front yard
on the edge of town, thumbs tucked under the bib of his overalls, a
railroader's cap on his head.
   ``Casey Jones was a good engineer,'' he was saying. ``Casey
would have made a good jet pilot. He was a bit of a chance-taker,
but he got caught in a trap that was not of his own making.
   ``If Casey hadn't of gotten killed, he would have died of a
broken heart, because he sure would have gotten fired for what
happened. Railroading was his first love. Even his wife Janie _ she
was the cutest thing _ came in second to railroading.''
   Bruce Gurner, 68, former schoolteacher and railroad engineer,
historian and photographer, fisherman, curator of his own backyard
museum of railroad memorabilia, chronicler of the last ride of
Casey Jones. Retired 10 years ago, after losing the sight in his
left eye, Gurner spends much of his time these days in his canoe
out on Enid Reservoir, running trotlines in quest of crappie and
catfish.
   ``I tried to be a commercial fisherman for a while after I
retired, but I found out that when you do it regular it's not as
much fun,'' he says. ``No telling where I would have gone if I
hadn't been kind of lazy.''
   For 40 years or so he had alternated between two careers,
railroading and teaching in high school. He was also shooting
pictures for the local weekly newspaper and working with the
Yalobusha County Historical Society, while raising five sons and a
daughter.
   Among his fondest memories are working on the City of New
Orleans, like his father and his uncles. That's the passenger train
that splits the heartland on its 920-mile run from Chicago to New
Orleans and was made famous by Arlo Guthrie's hit folk song in 1972.
   ``When I quit teaching at Oxford I put in two years on that
beautiful City of New Orleans firing (working as a fireman) for Cap
Gardner. Boy, was that high living. Making twice as much money as I
was teaching. Eight days a month off.''
   If you want to listen, Bruce Gurner can talk to you for hours
about highballing up and down the Illinois Central tracks from
Memphis, Tenn., to Canton, Miss., and the golden era of steam
locomotives, in the days when Water Valley was a railroad town,
with a big roundhouse and shop, and people like Casey Jones lived
there.

   ``Come all you rounders if you want to hear
   ``The story told of a brave engineer;
   ``Casey Jones was the rounders name,
   ``A high right-wheeler of mighty fame.''

   ``It took me 25 years to figure out what happened to him down
there at Vaughan,'' says Gurner, who collected rare photographs and
old railroad records and the recollections of Casey Jones' widow
and the old-timers who had ridden with him. ``Thing is, nothing
would have ever come of it except that an engine wiper in the
Canton shop, who was an old friend of Casey's, wrote that ballad
about it and some vaudeville performers picked it up.
   ``Engineers were getting killed all the time in those days of
heavy traffic on single-track railroads, when slow freights had to
be sidetracked to make way for the passenger trains. Sometimes they
didn't even get their names in the paper when they got killed, but
Casey had a song written about him and America had a new folk
hero.''
   At 12:50 a.m. on the morning of April 30, 1900 Casey Jones
pulled out of Memphis' Poplar Street Station at the throttle of the
Cannon Ball Express, with Sim Webb as his fireman and J.C. Turner
the conductor. Casey was leaving an hour and 35 minutes late and
wanted to make up the time before he reached Canton.

   ``Through South Memphis yards on the fly,
   ``He heard the fireman say, `You got a white eye.'
   ``All the switchmen knew by the engine's moan
   ``That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones.''
