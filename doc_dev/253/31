<LEADPARA>  Eric Struck has been working on the railroad -- but not all the livelong day
and definitely not just to pass the time away.;    "Uh oh, hold on. There's
been a derailment," said the 26-year-old Palo Alto resident who runs an
elaborate model railroad system in the comfort of his own back yard. "This
very rarely happens . . . I think I may have hit the switch too quickly."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For the past 10 years, Struck has been presiding as chief engineer and
architect over his scaled-down railroad, which he opens to the public every
weekend.;    His rail system takes up most of his small back yard, and Struck
plans to add several model buildings throughout the year.;    But it is
Struck's love for trains and model railroads that sustains his interest in the
hobby and draws children and curious adults from the area.;    "My father used
to work for the Union Pacific and had a Lionel train set," Struck said.
"Unfortunately, my mother threw out the train set, and you can't find model
trains of that quality any more. They're all made out of cheap plastic these
days.";    Struck's layout, which features model trains about 12 inches long,
winds its way around an oval track populated with toy people, a saloon,
houses, a train tunnel and a bridge. Within the next year or so, Struck said
he plans to add a fire station, a church, a hotel (next to the saloon, of
course), and a tile store (since that's where Struck works).;    The trains
used in Struck's design were made in Germany by Lehmann, Gross, Bahn, which
respectively refer to the company, the size (big) and the railway.;    "I use
LGB trains because they're weatherproof, well-made and you can really see a
lot of detail in them," Struck added.;    Indeed, one of the three engines
Struck runs features locomotive sound effects, a whistle and bells. The engine
even produces ersatz smoke from its stack.;    As a train aficionado, Struck
knows quite a bit about trains and railroad history. Not many people in
Struck's Barron Park neighborhood, for instance, can tell you that a rail line
used to run through the nearby Boll Park until 1962 and that Boll was a
professor at Stanford University. "I'll occasionally walk up to the CalTrain
station and watch the trains run," said Struck. "I just wish I could see the
old steam trains run again.";    Reactions to Struck's model railroad vary. He
said many of the children who view the setup ask their fathers to buy a train
set for them, some elderly people are impressed and a few adults just shrug
their shoulders and simply walk away.;    Palo Alto resident Lynnette Carey
and her 2-year-old son, Noel, recently paid a visit to Struck's backyard
railroad.;    "It's fun to see my son enjoy the trains and the miniature
houses," said Carey as she watched the train chug around its tiny world. "It's
the hit of the neighborhood.";    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Eric Struck's model
railroad is at 748 Kendall Ave., Palo Alto. It is open to the public on
weekends from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. There is no admission fee, but donations
are accepted. Elementary school classes are invited. For further information,
call (415) 493-7367.  </TEXT>
