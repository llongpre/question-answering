   Railroads have long been able to set their own
safety standards, and a railroad engineer doesn't even need a
driver's license, but federal authorities are rewriting the rules
of the rail.
   Ordered by Congress to take several steps to improve rail
safety, the Federal Railroad Administration already has extended
its authority over individual railroad employees, increased fines
for safety violations, required more testing and certification of
train control equipment, mandated automatic train controls on some
lines and imposed tough punishment for tampering with safety
devices.
   Most of the actions arise from the Railroad Safety Improvement
Act of 1988, which was prompted largely by the Jan. 4, 1987,
collision between an Amtrak train and three Conrail freight
locomotives at Chase, Md., that killed 16 people and hurt 175
others.
   Conrail engineer Ricky Gates, who has become a symbol for many
of the industry's problems, is serving a five-year prison term for
manslaughter after admitting he smoked marijuana shortly before the
crash and violated several safety procedures.
   Congress is working on mandatory drug-testing bills for railroad
employees, and the Supreme Court in March upheld post-accident
testing. An administration order requiring random drug testing is
being challenged in the courts.
   Still to come from the railroad administration are several other
rules related to safety. The most controversial are a national
licensing program for engineers and plans to impose federal
standards for rail-highway crossing signals.
   Federal safety officials reported last week that rail crossing
fatalities increased 10 percent last year to 689, while other
highway accidents went up less than 1 percent from 1987. Other
rail-related fatalities decreased from 616 to 564.
   The Association of American Railroads opposes new standards for
rail crossings, saying only one of 2,857 crossing accidents last
year was due to a faulty signal.
   Licensing, required in the 1988 law, has caused concern in the
industry, partly because the railroad administration has given no
hint of what it might include or how it could affect 78,000
engineers and other train crew members on the nation's nearly 500
railroads.
   The Coast Guard licenses ships' captains. Anyone who flies has
to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. And
everyone from a commercial truck driver to a kid with a moped needs
a state driver's license.
   But railroads always have been allowed to set their own
standards for training and hiring, and they like it that way.
   ``We're terribly, terribly interested, and the FRA has been
very, very closed-mouthed about this issue,'' said Jack Buckingham,
safety director for the American Association of Railroads, which
says the nation's railroads have adequate standards for engineers.
   FRA officials said the government's licensing plans will not be
disclosed until the rule is issued early next month. It will not
become law until after a comment period and public hearing.
   The rail safety act requires the agency to set minimum training
standards and to consider an applicant's automobile driving record
in issuing an engineer's license. Drunken driving convictions
within the past five years could lead to denial of an engineer's
license unless the applicant had completed a rehabilitation program.
   Buckingham said railroads follow fairly uniform standards for
hiring and training engineers and any federal licensing program
should be based on existing programs run by the largest railroads.
   Chicago Northwestern, which has about 950 engineers, will start
to train its 100th class this week, said spokesman Fred Bloedorn.
He said the five-week course includes classroom instruction on
operating rules, safety and equipment, followed by work in a
locomotive simulator.
   Burlington Northern has a simulator in Chicago that spokesman
Mike Wenninger said can make an inexperienced rider sick from the
motion. A trainee can feel the jolt of cars taking up the slack as
brakes are applied, and a movie screen shows actual track the
railroad uses, he said.
   Conrail, with 9,000 train and engine employees, makes 700,000
spot checks annually to ensure the railroad is run safely and
requires its employees to take a class on operating procedures and
pass a written exam each year, according to spokesman Don
Holloschutz.
   Tom Watts, a Union Pacific vice president, said he is concerned
that the licensing requirements meet the needs of an industry where
rail conditions vary. Much of engineers' training involves getting
to know the track they will ride, he said.
   ``We don't take a guy off the street and make him a mountain
engineer,'' Watts said.
