   Best-selling author Clive Cussler and some
300 volunteers found no signs during a weekend search of a
locomotive believed buried in a dry creek bed during an 1878 flood,
but he says they have not given up hope.
   ``In order to find it, we need to know where it isn't,'' Craig
Dirgo of Cussler's National Underwater and Marine Agency said Sunday
after the search ended. ``That's the key to any search.''
   Searchers braved 20-degree weather and gusty winds to sift
through a half-mile area near here for remnants of the
Kansas-Pacific locomotive.
   The engine, 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a railroad
bridge in 1878, when a flood struck the area 30 miles east of
Denver. Twelve of the cars and the locomotive were reported to have
been buried in the sand.
   Some researchers believe that the railroad subsequently salvaged
the expensive engine, but Cussler and his band of searchers are
still hoping it's still in the ground. The group hopes to squeeze in
one more weekend of hunting before spring to search a two-mile area
downstream from the original bridge.
   ``We know it's here and we will be back,'' Dirgo said.
   Volunteer Eric Walker of Darwin, Australia, found a part from a
railroad flat car. Others found slag and coal, which officials said
may have been used for ballast by the railroad.
   Cussler said if the locomotive is found, it will belong to the
landowner. Mike Pinzenscham, who watched the dig's progress with his
8-year-old son, Justin, said his family has owned the land for about
25 years.
   Through the Arvada-based agency, Cussler, the author of ``Raise
the Titanic,'' has located 54 sunken vessels including a dirigible.
But this is his first buried train hunt.
   The agency's next project will be a search for the steamship New
Orleans, which was built by Robert Fulton in 1811. Cussler said the
ship's bottom was torn out when it ran aground on a stump in the
Mississippi River at Baton Rouge, La.
