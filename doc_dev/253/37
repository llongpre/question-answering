<F P=106> [Interview with Lvov Railroad Chief Heorhiy Kirpa by </F>
Mykhaylo Vasylashko (Lvov-Ternopol-Khmelnitskiy): "The Problems 
Are Ours; Is the Purse Moscow's?"; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Anyone who travels often by rail has probably 
noticed improvements in passenger service on the Lvov Railroad's 
excellent trains. People started talking about service in Lvov 
when seasoned railroader Heorhiy Kirpa became chief of the 
railroad half a year ago. 
  Heorhiy Mykolayovych set about finding solutions to problems 
of passenger transport. But they can't be solved on the level of 
one railroad. The financial crisis is a killer. Russia alone 
owes the Lvov Line 32 billion rubles, 8 million Swiss Francs, 
and 2.5 million U.S. dollars for passenger transport. Then there 
are the debtors at home. For example, the Prydniprovsk Railroad 
owes 290 billion Ukrainian rubles. 
  [Vasylashko] How did this happen? 
  [Kirpa] You'll recall what Lenin did first to create the 
Soviet State. He took over the post office, the telegraph, and 
the train stations. And any new regime in the world has first 
taken over these key structures. Our own Ukraine has told the 
world that it is independent, yet it has not yet taken over the 
republic's railroads. Strange as it seems, we still do not have 
a law on railroad transport, no haulage regulations, statutes 
and other legal acts. 
  The Transport Ministry, Ukrzaliznytsya [Ukraine Railroad], 
has existed for two years, and we have been waiting for answers 
to many questions. Yet the economic situation, especially, is 
getting worse. Our biggest trouble is that Ukrzaliznytsya has 
failed to formulate its own legal status on centralized 
payments, has not detached Ukraine's six railroads from the old 
Moscow payment system, and has not set up its own center, which 
it should and could have done. Worse, last May Kiev asked Moscow 
to continue the payments. I chanced to ask about that in 
Russia's Railway Ministry, where I had gone to deal with 
problems of debt payment. 
  So much for our sovereignty. We run some kind of operation, 
and our neighbor figures our money on the Big Brother principle. 
Maybe he pays something if he feels like it. Of the 32 billion 
[rubles], the Lvov people have received two billion, and the oil 
products haven't been delivered either. Well, it's not 
surprising: Ukrzaliznytsya isn't even able to exercise internal 
control of payments, institute centralized fund accumulation, 
and so on. In short, there is a Ministry but no full-scale, 
planned state operation. It's no surprise, then, that something 
bad is happening--something like a bazaar--on the railroads, 
where discipline and order used to be so good. Conductors take 
as much as they can from passengers, cashiers sell tickets 
through fictitious persons. 
  Not only that, but even locomotive engineers are hauling 
passengers now. I found out about it because of an accident in 
which a passenger in a locomotive was injured by high voltage. 
In fact, it's hard to name a single sphere where people aren't 
trying to do biznes. It's the result of our economic 
policy. Certainly we're doing our best to prevent such 
violations. We are reorganizing the auditing system and 
automating ticket sales so there won't be empty seats permitting 
train masters to sell tickets on the train. But to restore order 
we have to fight the causes, not the results. And that, I think, 
is the state's department. 
  The Lvov railroaders are doing what they can to correct the 
situation. For shunting operations they have taken more than 30 
"revolution-era" steam engines out of mothballs and saved 
considerable fuel and oil. 
  [Vasylashko] But isn't it true, Heorhiy Mykolayovych, that 
the railroaders have gone so far as to engage in proletarian 
expropriation of fuel and oil--for example the recent case in 
Ternopol? 
  [Kirpa] Railroad transport is the only sector that isn't yet 
paralyzed today. Since the state has given all appropriations to 
the oil biznes--i.e. the Mafia--and we no longer get 
anything on a centralized basis, there's a real danger that the 
railroads will shut down, which means economic collapse. It's 
out of concern for the state that we have to take such unpopular 
steps. And we're retrieving money with those commercial prices. 
Starting last October I overpaid the businessmen by 25 percent; 
today it's 150 percent. I talked about that huge snag when I met 
with Zvyahilskyy. Energy ought to be in the state's hands. Right 
now the Mafia is cheating the state. Often, an oil tank car that 
has just crossed the border will return to Ukraine, this time to 
be re-directed somewhere to the south. What would you do in that 
case? Stop the passenger trains? It's impossible, because 
passenger traffic has almost doubled. Last year alone we 
dispatched an additional 178 trains, and even that's not enough. 
The railcar fleet is inadequate. We haven't had a car replaced 
in two years. 
  Let's say we expect no favors from Kiev. We have already 
made 
a deal with the Northern Railroad to repair cars in Kovel, and 
they will buy new ones with the money they make. That's how much 
trouble railroaders all over Western Ukraine are in. Although 
frankly, they're in somewhat better shape than other regions. 
Anyway, without a state program they can't get out of the 
crisis. And the Ministry and its leaders today have shown 
themselves to be incompetent. After all, what kind of proprietor 
is it that works and his neighbor counts his money? In such 
circumstances, it is time for either the President or the 
Supreme Council to undertake to nationalize the railroads. 
Otherwise, we'll lose everything with the railroads and be 
buried under the wreckage of sovereign Ukraine.
