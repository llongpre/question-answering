500-foot ravine in Gilpin County, Colorado.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  COLORADO; RAILROAD; ACCIDENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A lumber freight train collided with boulders, some "the size of a pickup
truck," and jumped its tracks early Monday, sending two of three locomotives
over a cliff. Two crew members were killed.;   The Rio Grande Railroad
accident, in rugged forest just inside Gilpin County about two miles east of
Pinecliffe, also left two other crewmen injured, according to Boulder County
Sheriff George Epp.  </LEADPARA>

TWO OF 3 LOCOMOTIVES PLUNGE OFF CLIFF  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     As one locomotive teetered on the track, a second lodged halfway down the
near-vertical slope. The third plunged into South Boulder Creek 250 feet
below.;   Brake operator John Beaird, 47, and conductor Ed G. West, 60, both
of Grand Junction, Colo., were crushed to death in the two lower locomotives.;
  Crew members John Sacco, 55, and Roy Alexander, 47, also of Grand Junction,
escaped before the 190-ton locomotives were crushed in the avalanche.;  
Alexander's hip and back were injured. He was in good condition at Boulder
Community Hospital late Monday. Bruised and battered, Sacco was treated and
released from a Denver hospital.;   Boulder Sheriff's Deputy Steve Davis was
among the first rescuers on the scene of the accident, which happened about
3:30 a.m.;   "As I approached, I could see the red glow of the fires," Davis
said. "We couldn't find anybody. It was way too smoky and way too hot.;  
"From what I saw, it's amazing anyone survived.";   "It was overwhelming to
see that amount of carnage and wreckage," A-1 Ambulance paramedic Stephanie
Korthius said. "I'd see these twisted pieces of rail and metal and say, 'God,
I can't believe something like this happened.' ";   Several lumber cars joined
the cascade, spreading their cargo down the slope. Others clung to the track's
ledge.;   Fires from the locomotives jumped to the lumber but never threatened
the nearby forest, Boulder Sheriff's Lt. Jim Smith said.;   More of an
environmental concern was the diesel fuel that poured from the maimed
locomotives' 5,200-gallon tanks. Some poured into South Boulder Creek, but
most of it was reported contained by oil-absorbent floating booms at Gross
Reservoir.;   Officials did not know the cost of the destroyed equipment or
the cost of the rescue and salvage effort.;   Boulder Emergency Squad and
Rocky Mountain Rescue workers extricated the charred bodies.;   Rio Grande
Railroad crews used a rail-riding crane, a front-loader tractor and two
flatcars loaded with ties and rails to clear wreckage and repair track.;   The
National Transportation Safety Board ordered toxicology tests for all four
crew members, which is standard procedure.;   The train, one of eight to 10 a
day that haul freight between Grand Junction and Denver, left Grand Junction
around 6 p.m. Sunday. Amtrack's California Zephyr passenger train, which makes
two trips daily on the track, was rerouted.;   Monte Sanders, a Denver-based
inspector with the Federal Railroad Administration, said that while rock
slides are frequent in other mountainous areas, none has been reported at the
site of Monday's wreck.;   "It's kind of an oddball place to have it," he
said.;   But Ed Larson, a University of Colorado geologist, said the granite
mountain may appear deceptively solid.;   "These rocks are always moving
slightly," Larson said. "They're very hard but can have a lot of cracks and
fractures, and sometimes pieces will break off."  </TEXT>
