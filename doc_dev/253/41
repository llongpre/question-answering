   With its roads and airports saturated, Western Europe is undertaking a radical upgrading of its railroads. 
And while national rivalries are hindering the effort to some extent, the first links of a continental network -- including a 31-mile tunnel under the English Channel -- are already under construction. 

   This transportation revolution promises to be a boon for Europe's once-beleaguered train-making industry. 
Analysts say orders from investment in a high-speed rail system could run into tens of billions of dollars. 

   "Demand has picked up and new opportunities are flowing through," says Andy Chambers, engineering analyst at the Nomura Research Institute in London. 
Competition will be fierce, however, and some smaller players could find themselves squeezed out of the market. 
Even bigger companies are forging collaboration agreements to strengthen their positions. 

   The shift in train makers' fortunes has been so swift, and opportunities so numerous, that analysts find it difficult to gauge which companies will benefit most from a high-speed Euro-train network. 
In general, they rate the prospects good for big concerns such as General Electric Co. PLC of Britain; Alsthom S.A., a unit of France's Cie. 
Generale d'Electricite; West Germany's Thyssen-Henschel, a unit of Thyssen AG; and Italy's Fiat Ferroviaria S.p.A., a unit of Fiat S.p.A. 

   Ambitions for a European network have traditionally been weakened by national initiative and pride. 
In different countries, manufacturers use different, often incompatible, track gauges and carriages. 

   West Germany, for example, has developed its own high-speed train, the InterCity Express, with little regard for France's "Train a Grande Vitesse," which has carried 100 million passengers over the past eight years on the Paris-to-Lyon link alone. 
Consequently, the German trains have wider carriages than the French. 

   But nationalism may be giving way to Europeanism. 
Last year, for instance, Spain announced plans to replace around 7,000 miles of wide-gauge track with the narrower track common in Europe. 
Indeed, Spain recently took the decision to spend more than $29 billion on improving its rail system. 

   And now, the 12-nation European Community is on the brink of completing a high-speed rail strategy. 
Last week, the EC transportation commissioner, Karel Van Miert, said the EC is close to proposing a policy on high-speed rail transport. 
"The golden age of the railroad isn't dead yet," Mr. Van Miert said. 
"We need to take greater advantage of the railroad's potential in Europe." 

   Some analysts believe the private sector will take on an increasing share of financing the railroad boom. 
While the French and West German railroads are heavily subsidized by public funds, the British government is making tentative plans to privatize rail services, and is keen to attract private money into rail projects such as the Channel Tunnel. 

   In July, Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French group behind the construction of the Channel Tunnel, placed orders valued at #600 million ($930 million) for train engines and cars from several, largely European consortiums. 
The purchases included contracts for 40 locomotives, 252 passenger cars and 252 heavy freight cars. 

   A group including Asea Brown Boveri Group, a Swiss-Swedish venture, and Britain's Hawker Siddeley Group PLC got the locomotives contract. 
A second consortium, including Bombardier Inc. of Canada, France's ANF Industrie and BN Constructions Ferroviaires et Metalliques of Belgium won the passenger car contract. 

   The freight cars are to be built by an Italian consortium of Breda Construzion Ferroviarie, a unit of Finanziaria Ernesto Breda S.p.A., and Fiat Ferroviaria. 

   In Britain, companies with train-making divisions such as GEC, Hawker Siddeley, Vickers PLC and BREL Ltd., in which Trafalgar House PLC and Asea Brown Boveri each have 40% stakes, are already benefiting from soaring domestic demand. 
And they are setting their sights on Europe's new high-speed network. 

   The boom is giving birth to joint ventures between engineering and electricity-industry titans. 
GEC's train-making business this year linked up with France's much-larger Alsthom to compete for European rail contracts. 
The new group is currently setting the pace in the European market, and has won contracts to provide 24 high-speed trains in Spain and 95 fast trains and 111 other trains for France. 

   On a smaller scale BREL has forged links with Asea Brown Boveri. 
Recently, BREL won the biggest-ever U.K. contract for railway carriages, a #350 million order to build a new generation of trains for London's subway system. 

   In West Germany, six companies are involved in locomotive production -- Siemens AG; the Asea Brown Boveri West German subsidiary; and AEG AG make electrical equipment, while Thyssen-Henschel; Krupp Maschinen Technik, a unit of Fried. 
Krupp G.m.b.H.; and Krauss-Maffei AG produce mechanical parts for locomotives.
