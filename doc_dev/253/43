ASEA Brown Boveri, the European engineering combine, yesterday urged India
not to abandon a controversial Dollars 190m (Pounds 110.4m) contract to buy
imported high-tech locomotives.
ABB executives, in India to plead their case, insisted New Delhi should
stick to its March decision to award the contract to ABB after a
four-and-a-half-year bidding process.
ABB won the contract for the supply of 30 locomotives against tough
competition from three other international bidders, including a partnership
between Sumitomo and Hitachi, the Japanese trading and engineering
companies. But protests have since surfaced on the grounds that India does
not need expensive imported technology when it has large railway workshops
of its own. The government has yet to sign a contract with ABB, or indicate
when one might be signed.
The arguments show that despite the economic liberalisation programme
launched by the government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, doing business
in India can still be fraught with problems. ABB, which has a large Indian
affiliate employing 4,000, has been supplying Indian railways since the
1960s. When India decided in the early 1980s to start replacing some of its
steam- and diesel-powered locomotives with electric ones, ABB was a
front-runner. In 1986, it supplied six of 18 electric locomotives India
imported on an experimental basis.
Locomotive technology then underwent a drastic change, with the
introduction, principally by ABB, of a new generation of
micro-chip-controlled alternating-current engines. So, when India invited
offers for 30 more locomotives, it was able to consider a more modern
engine, but one which was more expensive.
After four years' deliberation, the railway ministry awarded the contract to
ABB, but the decision went for review before the railway convention
committee, a government panel. The panel recently advised the government to
act in its own best judgment, but only after committee members had dropped
hints urging scrapping of the contract.
The committee's concerns focused on the cost of the project and a desire to
promote India's own engineering industry. Members questioned whether it
would not be better to buy home-made locomotives costing about a tenth the
price of the imports. Yesterday, Mr Amandus Jaeger, vice-president of ABB
Transportation Systems Switzerland, an ABB subsidiary, said the advantages
of the new-generation technology for India were 'tremendous'. The contract
included the transfer of the technology needed to make them. India would be
able to produce the new high-tech engines in Indian factories.
