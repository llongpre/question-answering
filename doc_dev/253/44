   The newest generation of France's
high-speed passenger trains established a world rail speed record
Tuesday when it topped out at 299.7 mph while racing through the
Loire Valley, the French national railroad said.
   The record-breaking TGV locomotive comprised two bullet-nosed
engines pulling four cars, down from the usual 10 cars, the Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer said.
   The train, which carried no passengers, broke the record of 253
mph set in May 1988 by an Inter-City Experimental locomotive in
West Germany.
   Tuesday's record was set on a section of track in the Loire, a
famed wine-growing region, that is due to come into service next
year with the TGV Atlantic service linking northwestern French
cities with the high-speed train.
   Normal top speed for the TGV Atlantic is 186 mph along specially
constructed track.
   Premier Michel Rocard inaugurated the first phase of the TGV
Atlantic service Sept. 20. The trains carry passengers between 12
cities in northwestern France and are due to expand south to the
Spanish border next September.
   The blue-and-silver trains represent the second generation of
the TGV service, which opened between Paris and the French Riviera
in 1981. The new trains are faster, ride more smoothly and are
equipped with telephones for business travelers.
