<HEAD>Trainmaster Says Wrong Engineer Took Charge Before Derailment</HEAD>

   The engineer who decided to stop a freight
train on a steep slope and disconnect the locomotives, causing a
derailment and explosion, didn't have the authority to do so, a
railroad official testified Thursday.
   Michael Lemm, Montana Rail Link's trainmaster at Helena, said
engineer Robert Estes was not in charge of the 49-car train when he
ordered the engines detached and realigned because the lead
locomotive had lost power and heat.
   Lemm testified on the second day of a National Transportation
Safety Board hearing into an accident that knocked out electricity
in Helena on Feb. 2, when it was 27 degrees below zero and the wind
chill was about 70 below.
   Estes was engineer of three ``helper'' locomotives assigned to
assist the train over the mountains at the Continental Divide. Jody
McCloud, engineer of the train itself, did not want to realign the
locomotives, but did not challenge Estes' decision. He offered to
run the train from the cold lead locomotive, but Estes rejected the
idea.
   While the locomotives were detached, the train began rolling
down the track 11 miles into Helena where it collided with other
locomotives. Several cars derailed and two carrying hydrogen
peroxide and isopropyl alcohol were involved in an explosion that
shattered windows for miles and severed power lines.
   About 3,500 residents were evacuated, but there were no serious
injuries. Damage has been estimated at $10 million.
   The disagreement between Estes and McCloud was detailed in
testimony by the two men Wednesday. Lemm was quizzed about the
issue Thursday.
   ``I believe Mr. McCloud was in charge of that train,'' he told
NTSB officials.
   While Estes may have been controlling the train from his
``helper'' locomotive, McCloud was responsible for the train itself
and had the discretion to assume control, Lemm said.
   Also testifying Thursday was Fritz Zettel, hazardous materials
specialist for the Helena Fire Department. He complained of
problems in obtaining details on the cargo in some of the derailed
cars.
   He also recounted problems the city had with emergency
communications during the power outage, and said the railroad
should involve city officials more in developing their plans for
train accidents.
   The final NTSB report on the accident is not expected until late
this year.
