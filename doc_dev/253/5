<LEADPARA>  While restoration of an old steam locomotive sitting on a spur on the west
side of Santa Cruz continues, its owner -- Eccles &amp; Eastern Railroad Co. --
could be in the freight train business within six months.;    At least that's
what Rick Hamman, president of the fledgling railroad, said Thursday. He
indicated that the moneymaking freight trains would not be pulled by the
turn-of-the century steam engine, which would be reserved for excursion trips
the railroad hopes to run once restoration is complete.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Eccles &amp; Eastern bought its 133-ton 1904 Baldwin locomotive from the city
of Watsonville in 1989. Before its move, which started, coincidentally, on the
morning of Oct. 17, 1989, the day of the Loma Prieta earthquake -- the old
steam engine had been a fixture for more than a quarter century in the city's
Ramsay Park, where children had crawled over and through the old choo-choo and
a nearby steam shovel.;    The city decided to get rid of the old locomotive
because of safety concerns, prompted to a great degree by the discovery of
asbestos in the engine, according to Pat Donohue, Watsonville recreation
director.;    Although Hamman said he couldn't discuss exactly what freight
business his company might be doing within the next half year, he did say
Thursday that plans to rebuild an old rail link through the mountains between
Santa Cruz and San Jose are in the works.;    So far, he said, his company is
negotiating for or has purchased enough land to allow it to put down track on
an old railroad right of way through Zayante Canyon out of Felton to a point
called Mountain Charlie.;    In the meanwhile, he said, Eccles &amp; Eastern hopes
to get the "Evening Drifter" locomotive rolling. This train, according to
Hamman, would leave Santa Cruz at dusk, chug up to Mountain Charlie and stop
for the night. Passengers would be served dinner, treated to dancing and
lounge service, then have breakfast before returning to the surf city in the
morning.;    If and when rails are laid down all the way from Santa Cruz to
San Jose, he said, passenger service would be established -- probably
something like the old Suntan Special that once brought tourists to the beach
and boardwalk in Santa Cruz.;    But, said Hamman, the real money for Eccles &amp;
Eastern would be in moving sand and other freight over the mountains.;   
"We're looking at moving 5,000 to 8,000 tons of sand a day from Santa Cruz
County to San Jose," he said.;    Obtaining the right of way, laying tracks
and getting over-the-hill service under way could take several years, Hamman
said.;    Insisting that neither he nor other Eccles &amp; Eastern officials are
train nuts, Hamman -- who said his company might go public this autumn -- "are
business people. We're trying to turn a dollar.";    Wishing the railroad
luck, at least as far as getting the old steam locomotive running again, are
officials in Watsonville.;    "The old engine had fallen into neglect,"
recreation Director Donohue admitted Thursday. "But when the city thought
about the romance and the glamour of putting the old engine back on the rails,
why, it sounded like a wonderful idea."  </TEXT>
