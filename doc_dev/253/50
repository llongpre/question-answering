   Federal safety investigators recommended that all trains operating in the busy Northeast corridor be equipped with systems that automatically stop them at a signal if the engineer fails to heed the signal. 

   The National Transportation Safety Board issued its first official recommendations from a continuing investigation of the Jan. 4 collision between an Amtrak passenger train and a string of Consolidated Rail Corp. freight locomotives northeast of Baltimore. 
The crash killed 16 persons and injured more than 170. 

   The safety board said it believes that an automatic train-control device on the Conrail locomotive "probably would have prevented the accident." 

   The investigative agency also urged interim requirements, pending the equipping of Conrail and other trains operating in the Boston-Washington corridor with automatic control devices. 

   Engineers on trains without such equipment and planning to use the high-speed passenger-train tracks should be required to stop before pulling onto the track, regardless of signals, and then be cleared for entry before proceeding, the safety board said. 

   Amtrak locomotive cabs are equipped with the devices, which automatically start braking a locomotive when the engineer fails to follow required procedures for stopping or slowing down after such signals. 

   The safety board recommendations for requiring automatic train-control devices and mandatory train stops before pulling onto passenger-train trackage were made to Amtrak, which owns the Northeast rail corridor. 

   An Amtrak spokeswoman said that Amtrak considers it has the authority to order Conrail to install the devices, but wouldn't say whether it will order the installation. 
Conrail declined to comment on the safety board recommendations. 

   The accident occurred when the Conrail locomotive ran through a stop signal into the path of the Amtrak Colonial, federal officials said, and the faster Amtrak train rammed the rear of the Conrail engines. 

   Federal investigators have increasingly focused on human error as a likely cause of the crash, after tests suggested that a crucial warning signal didn't malfunction as the Conrail engineer has insisted. 
"We have satisfied ourselves" that the "integrity" of the the electrical signaling system was intact, Joseph Nall, the safety board member in charge of the investigation, said on the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour yesterday. 

   Safety board investigators are making the actions of the Conrail crew before the crash "a focal point" of the probe, he said. 
Mr. Nall also said the presence of marijuana in the blood and urine of the Conrail locomotive engineer and brakeman, disclosed Wednesday, could mean that their use of the drug was a "contributing cause" of the collision. 

   The automatic control systems respond only to the electric signaling unique to the Northeast corridor, an Amtrak spokesman said. 
The spokesman added that the systems are more needed there because of high speeds of passenger trains and heavy rail traffic. 

   In issuing the recommendations, the safety board noted that Conrail's current diesel locomotives replaced electric locomotives that had been equipped with those devices. 
Mr. Nall said, "I suppose it's a matter of economics." 

   The agency said it urged Amtrak in 1978 to require all trains operating in the corridor to be equipped with automatic train-control systems. 
Amtrak responded with tighter rules for trains approaching a stop signal, but said Northeast corridor train service would be "disrupted significantly" if operation of vehicles not equipped with the automatic control devices were prohibited. 

   The safety board wrote to Amtrak in 1982 that Amtrak's substitute actions were acceptable.
