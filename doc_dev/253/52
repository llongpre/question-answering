Oceanside residents got a glimpse of the future Monday when a Toronto commuter 
train pulled into the downtown transit center for a six-hour visit. The 
powerful diesel engine and one double-decker commuter car are what North County 
rail commuters will be riding in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger cars, which resemble pregnant guppies from the outside, sport 
padded seats, plenty of legroom and wide aisles on the inside. Each has a 
seating capacity of 163, with space for an equal number of standees. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Furniss, executive vice president of the Michigan firm that manufactures 
the commuter cars, said they are designed for safety and efficiency, without 
some of the frills of long-distance passenger carriers.

<P>
"We could put cellular phones in, we could have a conference room at one end, 
we could have a nursery. These things have been done in special excursion 
trains," Furniss said. "But, for short-run commuter trains, we are designing 
for moving a large number of people. Comfortable seating, yes, but no frills." 
</P>
<P>
The cars also will be equipped with manual ramps to allow wheelchair access to 
the trains, he said. Automated wheelchair ramps have proved to be unreliable, 
so the manufacturer has designed a lightweight ramp that can be placed between 
the platform and the car, Furniss said. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto commuter rail system moves 85,000 persons a day in 10-car trains 
carrying 2,000 passengers, Furniss said. The cars are designed with double 
doors designed to allow passengers to exit quickly -- 200 in two minutes -- to 
cut down the standing time in stations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no bar or dining facilities on the 42-mile run, according to 
North County Transit District spokesmen, but there will be fast, efficient 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Commuter trains are expected to run at half-hour intervals from Oceanside south 
to San Diego's Santa Fe station on Broadway, stopping at stations in Carlsbad, 
Encinitas, Solana Beach, Sorrento Valley, Miramar and Old Town on the way. The 
trip is expected to take about an hour.
