   Researchers have developed a diesel locomotive that runs on coal instead of petroleum. 
But whether it ever becomes a commercial reality depends on scientists beating a nasty corrosion problem. 

   Southwest Research Institute, a San Antonio-based technology research organization, said that it and General Motors Corp. successfully ran a locomotive engine on powdered coal. 
The coal was suspended in water, which served as a medium to deliver the fuel to the engine. 

   Southwest said the federally funded experiment "represents an advance for the U.S. in a push toward a return to coal." 
But Timothy Callahan, a research engineer at Southwest, said that the mixture was highly abrasive and quickly wore out some engine parts. 

   Mr. Callahan said the engine's combustion chamber needs to be redesigned to prevent the coal from getting on the cylinder liner. 
He added that the injection system also needs to be redesigned, using harder tungsten carbide materials. 

   The engine used in the experiment was a slightly-modified model from GM's Electro-Motive division. 

   Retrofitting diesel locomotives to run on coal would save a lot of oil and provide an economic boost for the U.S.'s coal-producing regions. 
The Association of American Railroads says the U.S.'s major carriers last year burned about three billion gallons of diesel fuel in 21,000 or so locomotives. 

   But a spokesman for the railroad association, which was involved in coal-engine research in the early 1980s, said he wouldn't be surprised if it took 20 years to solve the abrasion problem, so corrosive is coal. 
"It works great in the laboratory," the spokesman said. 
"But it eats up the actual engine parts." 

   Because of the corrosion problem and also because the price of diesel oil currently is low, the spokesman said the AAR "sees nothing happening (with coal-powered locomotives) in the near future."
