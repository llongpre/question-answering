Bell police detective Hector Camacho, a walkie-talkie in hand, stood in the cab 
of a creeping locomotive on Friday when a dented four-door Buick sped across 
the Otis Street crossing less than 40 feet from the engine. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus, lady!" Camacho yelled as he radioed a nearby squad car, which 
eventually pulled the woman over and issued her a $100 citation for running the 
flashing red lights at the rail crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"She never slowed down, she just gunned it," Camacho said. "She had two kids in 
the back seat. If that car had stalled, we would have nailed them." 
</P>
<P>
The number of people violating railroad crossing zones along this six-mile 
stretch of Union Pacific tracks in southeast Los Angeles County is among the 
highest in California, and Camacho was aboard the "Trooper Special" to help nab 
motorists or pedestrians busting through, going around or racing under crossing 
gates or flashing signals. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran detective was part of the inaugural operation to cut down on 
railroad accidents, which targeted the cities of Vernon, Maywood, Huntington 
Park, Bell and Cudahy, an area considered among the most dangerous in the 
state. From his perch, Camacho would radio two chase units, which issued 17 
tickets to impatient drivers in less than 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"At times we've all had to wait at a crossing, and we've all thought about 
running it," Camacho said. "But it doesn't pay. The risk is too great." 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific engineer Jim McInerney, who piloted the Trooper Special, knows 
the dangers all too well. Several years ago in the City of Industry, he struck 
a car that bolted in front of his engine, killing the driver and her two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"Once that happens you never forget it. It takes a locomotive going 55 m.p.h. 
nearly a mile and a half to stop. But people don't think that way," said 
McInerney, who spends his off hours lecturing schoolchildren about the dangers 
of playing near rail lines. He is a volunteer for Operation Lifesaver, a 
non-profit organization funded by the nation's largest rail companies to reduce 
accidents at highway crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Since the group's creation a decade ago, the number of accidents along 
California's 6,500 miles of rail lines has dropped from about 650 a year to 
300. But the number of fatalities statewide has grown recently, from 34 in 1988 
to 44 last year. About a quarter of those fatalities in 1989 occurred in Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Accident figures do not include the countless times motorists grow weary of 
waiting and simply plow through crossing gates. In recent years, rail companies 
have begun installing aluminum "breakaway" gates to cut down on replacement 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
But at major intersections, like Bandini and Downey avenues in Vernon, 
repairing even the newer-model gates is expensive. Union Pacific spent $63,000 
on gates last year at that crossing alone. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection is near a switching yard, and trucker Todd Watkins said the 
crossing is blocked frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen guys just barrel into those gates," Watkins said. "They can't afford 
to wait. Time is money." 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Lenert, a Santa Fe Railroad safety expert and regional chief of 
Operation Lifesaver, said running a crossing is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"When you tangle with 11,000 tons of steel, no matter how slow it's going, 
there is going to be some serious damage," he said. "I've seen cars busted into 
tiny pieces when hit by a locomotive." 
</P>
<P>
Yet rail officials say the hurry-up lifestyle of many people tempts them to 
test their timing -- and nerves -- and dart through a rail crossing rather than 
wait for a train to pass. 
</P>
<P>
It was no different Friday at the Otis Street crossing on the Bell-Cudahy 
border. As the Union Pacific engine, traveling 15 m.p.h., approached the 
two-lane road a steady stream of vehicles crossed the tracks despite the 
flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho had a field day, barking out descriptions over the radio of the 
offending cars and trucks. As the locomotive chugged past the crossing, a 
handful of officers were off to the side issuing citations to a half-dozen 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"Like little kids who play chicken on the tracks, those drivers do the same 
thing," Camacho said. "They like to see how close they can cut it. Today, they 
were lucky. All they got was a ticket. Next time they might get the front end 
of this engine."
