   A rail placed across train tracks by
vandals derailed a high-speed locomotive with 368 passengers
aboard, but no one was injured, railway officials said Monday.
   The bullet-nosed TGV _ ``train a grand vitesse'' or high-speed
train _ was traveling at a relatively slow 78 mph when it struck
the 551-pound rail Sunday evening.
   The impact caused the train's front wheels to jump off the
tracks, but the rest of the engine and the dozen cars it was
pulling remained on the rails.
   Officials from the national railway, Societe National des
Chemins de Fer, said the rail used to block the track came from a
nearby repair site.
   Police said the incident was unconnected to a series of protests
by regional residents opposed to a plans to expand the high-speed
rail network into the Provence wine country.
   ``This was the work of idle juveniles, not train sabotage,'' a
railway spokesman said.
   The accident near the village of Cuers blocked traffic on the
Toulon-Nice line from Sunday evening until dawn Monday. A crane
lifted the locomotive onto the track and another engine towed it to
a rail yard for inspection.
   The TGV trains normally travel at 187 mph on special track
between Paris and Lyon or Le Mans, but elsewhere they ride on
regular tracks at slower speed.
