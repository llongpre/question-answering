'CIGARETTES, bread, fruit,' screamed the street tout. He was doing good
business and hoping his wares would not run out before the train reached its
destination. This was quite likely. We had been derailed twice, set off two
hours late and been delayed for eight hours en route.
Not bad for a scheduled eight-hour journey, but no one travelling on
Ecuador's trans-Andean railroad can complain they did not get their money's
worth in entertainment and scenery. The ride from the Andean town of Alausi
to the Pacific lowlands of Guayaquil is best taken armed with a sense of
humour and no expectation of reaching your destination on time.
Much of the track has been out of service since flooding in 1982. The full
journey from the capital, Quito, to the coast features a descent from 3,238
metres to almost sea level in just 80km. But until repairs are completed
this summer, travellers start part-way down at the Indian town of Alausi. We
arrived at Alausi 30 minutes before the 9 am departure to find a queue
stretching out of the wooden station. Backpackers jostled with locals
swinging sacks of live chickens while a party of well-dressed North
Americans on a pre-paid tour kept their distance.
The carriages, a line of converted cattle trucks with unglazed holes for
windows, stood waiting. An executive coach with reclining upholstered seats
looked more comfortable, but that was reserved for the North Americans. The
best alternative seemed the roof. Ecuadorians prefer it for good reasons:
you are guaranteed a seat, get beautiful views and in the event of
de-railing you can always jump.
10am came and went, as did 11am. At 11.30am the train finally shuddered into
action. As soon as we left the town we found ourselves travelling high on
the wall of a deep valley, flanked by forests. Below, huge rivers, dwarfed
by distance, appeared to trickle to the hot lands ahead.
The driver, keen to make up lost time, was enjoying the power of his new
diesel engine, which had replaced steam a few weeks earlier. Unfortunately,
the concrete sleepers being brought in as part of a renovation programme had
not yet been installed. The existing sleepers - wooden, and rotten - were
unable to cope with the weight of the diesel and within 10 minutes there was
a massive jolt as the front carriage derailed.
'It's not unusual,' said a vendor, leaping down to join passengers shouting
advice to the train crew. Fortunately, staff carry a kit of crow bars,
wedges of track and chains, and within 10 minutes the train was back on the
rails. But it took the best part of an hour before the track was in anything
approaching working order.
As we set off, the scenery became more spectacular and within half-an-hour
we were approaching the high spot of the journey, the Devil's Nose, a
perpendicular wall of rock more than 300m high. The track down the Devil's
Nose, heralded as a 'miracle of engineering' when it was completed in 1902,
allows the train to descend by advancing and reversing along a zig-zag of
hair-raising switchbacks.
But as we rattled along the cliff ledge, peering nervously over the edge, we
heard a loud bang behind us. A jolt sent chickens and backpacks flying as
the luxury tourist coach glanced off rocks and derailed just before a
corner.
No one was hurt, but a long delay was inevitable. White-faced passengers
emerged toting cameras to record their near miss. 'Well, I told you it would
be an adventure, Bob,' a lady from Iowa told her husband. A handful of
frightened passengers opted to walk back to Alausi, while the on-board chain
gang got their equipment out again.
The journey down the cliff face was spectacular, if uneventful compared with
the adventures of the morning. When we reached the bottom it was as though
we had crossed a divide between the two geographies and personalities of
Ecuador. When we left Alausi we were in the bleak world of poncho-wearing,
Quechua-speaking Indians which moves to the rhythms of the pan pipes.
At the base of the Devil's Nose we saw the first signs of the other Ecuador.
The vegetation was denser and greener, the weather hotter and more humid.
The people are different, too. The coastal plains, dominated by banana
plantations and rice paddies, are inhabited by more open and relaxed
salsa-loving blacks and mestizos.
At the first big town, a ramshackle collection of tin-roofed houses called
Bucay, many of the passengers had had enough. We were not likely to reach
Guayaquil until midnight and buses were waiting to ferry out the
disenchanted. We opted to stay on the roof, soaking up the atmosphere of the
lowland outback until the train pulled into Milagro.
Milagro is a large town of 170,000 people, but lacks properly-paved roads.
The puddles in the pot-holes make an ideal breeding ground for malarial
mosquitos which plague the coast, and even the best of the hotels are damp
and dreary.
Milagro means miracle, but on that that wet night the only miracle that
sprung to mind was that anyone wanted to live there. It was two days until
the next train pulled into town, and the journey would have taken four
hours, so we abandoned it in favour of the hour-long bus ride.
With French and Spanish backing, the head of the Ecuadorian rail company
promised me that things were going to get better. Modern sleepers would put
an end to derailments and new locomotives will allow them to travel faster.
New carriages are on order, too - meaning an end of the cattle trucks.
But the passengers in these cattle trucks are mainly Indians travelling to
the coast for whom the main attraction of the train is the fare - at 20p, a
fraction of the cost of the bus. For the tourist, there is only one place to
be, the roof. Up there, no amount of money is going to improve the feeling
of the wind in your hair, the sun in your face and panoramic views all
round.
Abbie Wightwick travelled independently to Quito and then took a bus via
Riobamba to Alausi. The larger touring companies in Quito, such as
Metropolitan Touring on Av Amazonas, organise all-in tours, including bus to
Alausi, returning to Quito from towns at the bottom of the Devil's Nose.
