<P>
The train whistles that echo through the redwood forest here bring visitors 
back to the 1800s, when sturdy little steam engines hauled carloads of timber 
down from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the historic locomotives are carrying sightseers up the steep 
grades to view virgin stands of Sequoia sempervirens, the tallest species of 
trees in the world. Just hop aboard the Roaring Camp &amp; Big Trees 
Narrow-Gauge Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The one-of-a-kind railway makes a scenic 12-mile round-trip journey beneath a 
canopy of coastal redwoods in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The excursion takes 
about 1 hour and 15 minutes, but you can get off to picnic in the woods and 
then catch a later train back to the depot. 
</P>
<P>
The Roaring Camp station is seven miles north of Santa Cruz in this rural town 
that was named after a lawyer, Charles Felton, who later became a U.S. 
congressman and senator. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,800 acres of the adjacent forest have been preserved as Henry Cowell 
Redwoods State Park, where you can explore 20 miles of trails and camp among 
the evergreens. The park also has a nature display center and a riverside 
picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexican Land Grant 
</P>
<P>
The redwoods were part of a Mexican land grant, Rancho Canada del Rincon. Some 
of them came into the possession of a boisterous Kentucky mountain man, Isaac 
Graham, who established a rough-and-tumble place called Roaring Camp. 
</P>
<P>
After his death, loggers wanted the property, but Joseph Welch, a San Francisco 
businessman, bought the land to protect the big trees. 
</P>
<P>
However, the lumbermen succeeded in getting right-of-way through Welch's 
redwoods and built a narrow-gauge railroad from Felton to Santa Cruz in 1875. 
Later, a connecting line was added from San Jose over the mountains, and 
tourists by the train load came from San Francisco to see the awesome trees. 
</P>
<P>
Welch operated a rustic resort for visitors to his Big Trees Grove, where some 
redwoods tower more than 250 feet. After his death a portion of the property 
became a county park. In 1954 it was absorbed into a state park, with 
surrounding land donated by the Henry Cowell family. 
</P>
<P>
Another section of Welch's untouched forest was later leased by his descendants 
so that the old narrow-gauge railway could get up steam again. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the dreams and determination of a Los Angeles train buff, the late F. 
Norman Clark, Roaring Camp &amp; Big Trees RR made its debut in 1963. More than 
250,000 people now ride the old-time trains annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derelict Engines 
</P>
<P>
Get here from Los Angeles by driving U.S. 101 and California 1 north to Santa 
Cruz, then exiting north on River Street/California 9 to Felton. Turn right on 
Graham Hill Road and go about a half mile to the right-hand entrance to Roaring 
Camp. 
</P>
<P>
You'll pass a century-old depot awaiting restoration, and a train yard filled 
with derelict engines and rail cars. After reaching the parking lot ($3 on 
weekends in the summer; free at other times), walk through the covered bridge 
and past a duck pond to the ticket office at trackside. 
</P>
<P>
Excursions depart at 11 a.m., 12:15, 1:30, 2:45 and 4 p.m. daily through Labor 
Day, Sept. 4. The same schedule applies on weekends and holidays through the 
rest of September, but on weekdays the only departure is at noon. No 
reservations are required. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of the year trains depart at noon, 1:30 and 3 p.m. on weekends 
and holidays, plus a noon run on weekdays. Christmas Day is the only time that 
the railroad doesn't operate. 
</P>
<P>
Round-trip fares are $10.50; ages 5 through 17 pay $7.50. The ride is free for 
children under 5. Call (408) 335-4400 (recording) or (408) 335-4484 for 
additional information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Squeal of the Wheels 
</P>
<P>
If the train is returning from a trip, you'll hear its whistle and the squeal 
of wheels on the tracks as it descends through the trees. Listen for the roar 
of escaping steam as the engine is "blown down" to keep pressure from getting 
too high in the boiler. 
</P>
<P>
While passengers climb aboard for the next excursion, the spout of an 
old-fashioned water tower is pulled down to refill the engine. Then the steam 
whistle blows and the train circles a grassy meadow before huffing and puffing 
to get up some of the steepest railroad grades in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the railroad's steam locomotives are being used -- a 1910 Shay called 
Sonora and an 1899 Heisler named Tuolumne. They pull four open-top cars with 
bench seats and a covered car at the rear. Passengers needn't worry about soot 
from the smoke stack because the old engines burn oil instead of coal. 
</P>
<P>
Vandals set fire to a corkscrew trestle several years ago, so the train must 
stop to back up into a siding that switches to a spur and bypasses the burned 
section of track. As the train crawls up the mountainside the conductor tells 
the history of the Roaring Camp railroad and describes the tree-filled scenery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ring of Redwoods 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is invited to get off at Cathedral Grove to stand in a ring of 
towering redwoods and hear about the tree's life cycle. The conductor also 
talks about its relatives -- the giant Sequoia in the Sierra Nevada and the 
dawn redwood in China. 
</P>
<P>
If you've brought food and drink you can disembark at Bear Mountain to picnic. 
The train trip up to the picnic area takes about 50 minutes, while the downhill 
ride over the same tracks gets you back to the depot in just 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
From Roaring Camp you also can depart on the Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific 
Railway Co. diesel train, which began excursions to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk in 
1987. Two round trips are made daily through Labor Day, then only weekends and 
holidays through Oct. 29. Tickets are $16 (weekdays $12), children $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
You can browse in the Roaring Camp General Store for railroad books and 
souvenirs. Visitors also hiss and boo villains during melodrama shows presented 
three times daily on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toasted Marshmallows 
</P>
<P>
A chuck-wagon barbecue is available from noon to 3 p.m. on weekends through 
October. The menu ($7.95 to $13.95) features charbroiled hamburgers, chicken, 
ribs and steaks, plus salad, beans, beverages and marshmallows to toast on the 
campfire. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the tracks a path leads into the state park and mile-long Redwood 
Grove Trail. Pick up a self-guiding leaflet to the giant trees that have been 
named for U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
You can reach the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park campground and its 112 sites 
by driving south on Graham Hill Road. Make reservations through Mistix by 
calling toll-free (800) 444-7275. The reservation fee is $3.95, plus $10 a 
night (no hookups for RVs). 
</P>
<P>
For information about lodgings and restaurants in the area, call the Santa Cruz 
County Conference and Visitors Council at (408) 425-1234. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Felton and Roaring Camp railroad through the
