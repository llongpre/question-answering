<TEXT>     The largest display of trains and equipment in the United States in nearly
50 years, Railfair '91 rolls lock, stock and steam whistle into Old Sacramento
on its journey back through time and memory. During its run, today through
Sunday, May 12, the festival should be heaven on rails for anyone who has ever
traveled on, driven, worked on or dreamed about an Iron Horse.;    Or for
anyone whose first words after "Mama" and "Dada" were "choo-choo." Which takes
in just about all of us, doesn't it?;    Presented by the California State
Railroad Museum as a commemoration of its 10th anniversary, Railfair '91 is a
sort of Disneyland of trains. On the museum's 15-acre site, 40 trains from the
United States, Canada, Great Britain and Mexico will be displayed, along with
historical exhibits, toy train set-ups, "living history" characters in period
dress and collections of railroad art and photographs. There will also be a
Railroad Musical Revue with scores of performers acting out a history of
railroading on a set that comes with real trains rolling across the stage.;   
A "Jr. Engineer" program will teach youngsters how to "drive" a train. A road
crew of gandy dancers will rap out some of their old work songs. The trains'
engineers and restorers will be on hand to talk about the nuts and bolts of
their railroading passion.;    And May 10, the anniversary of the driving of
the golden spike -- which signified the completion of the first
transcontinental rail line at Promontory Point, Utah, in 1869 -- will be noted
in Railfair style: As the trains blow their whistles and bands play, a
telegraph line from Promontory Point will sing the same message it did at
11:47 a.m. on that historic day 122 years ago -- the simple but epochal word
"Done.";    The museum sits on the exact spot where the western end of the
transcontinental line began in 1863.;    The $1.5 million event, which has
taken two years to produce, is expected to draw as many as 300,000 visitors,
with about 10 percent of them coming from other countries.;    "This is a
one-of-a-kind event," said Kathy Daigle of Railfair's executive committee in
an interview at the site, Tuesday. "For train people, it is like the Tall
Ships. Something like this just doesn't happen very often.";    The first
Railfair was held in 1981, and Daigle noted that there hasn't been a gathering
of trains on this grand a scale since the Chicago World's Fair of 1949.;   
"There's been a resurgence of interest in trains in recent years," she said.
"I think that it has to do with the romance of the rails, with the majesty of
trains.";    That romance and majesty could be seen in all directions here. In
the museum, a green and gold highlighted Pullman coach from the Canadian
National Railway was on display, outfitted with a device that simulates a
train barreling along the rails. Taking a walk through the shuddering coach --
with its blacked-out windows lighted from time to time with the arcs of
"passing" road lights -- was like returning to an age when people cozied up
and slept, as the immense trains rolled across the land.;    The romance that
Daigle spoke of could be seen in the eyes of Ted Creveling, 67, of Los
Angeles. Sitting on a siding and staring in awe the sleek lines and dazzling
red, orange and black colors of Southern Pacific engine No. 4449, "The
Daylight," Creveling seemed to be lost in wonder. "I'm a real steam fan," he
said. "You see an engine like that, and you can visualize the movement, the
steam and smoke and the drivers, as it moves down the track.";    Taking in
the same scene, Beck Davis, 11, of Nelson was more succinct. "I think it's
cool," he said.;    The transporting of the engines was an involved
proposition. The cost of getting the trains to the site ranged from $20,000 to
$100,000 per engine. The British trains were sent by ship on a voyage that
lasted three weeks.;    The voyage was obviously worth it to Capt. Bill Smith.
Standing proudly next to the apple-green Great Northern Railway engine he
restored, Smith talked to anyone and everyone who came by -- as he plans to do
during Railfair.;    "I have been mad about trains since I was 5," said Smith,
who wouldn't own up to any specific age. "I got away from them while I served
in the Royal Navy from 1938 to 1961." But in 1959, he purchased the 1899
engine from British Rail and began the first private restoration of an old
train in England.;    Why did he do it?;    "Well, it keeps me out of the
rocking chair," he said.;    While Smith was talking, a freight train rumbled
across a bridge over the river downstream. It wasn't a part of the exhibit but
a "real" train, hauling goods to who knows where, within a whistle blast of
its ancient counterparts.;    That is the reality of railroading these days.
There is the glorious past, reflected in brass fittings and the painted
cylinders of driver wheels and the filigreed lettering on shiny boilers. And
there is the workaday present of rusting freights and dull Amtrak passenger
trains being overflown and outdistanced by airliners.;    But the trains and
participants of Railfair '91 are reminders of the days when trains ruled --
and played a crucial role in settling -- this vast land. They did it in a
style to which we, sadly, are no longer accustomed.;    Black ties all the
way.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;  The California Historical Society has issued
