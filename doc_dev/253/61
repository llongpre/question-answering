   In an self-published account of Jones' last ride, Gurner, who
has made that same run many times, described how Jones had probably
made up that lost time.
   ``Passenger comfort was not too important in those days and
damage suits for being thrown about at high rates of speed almost
unheard of,'' Gurner says.
   The Cannon Ball was on time when it reached Goodman, 10 miles
north of Vaughan, but disaster awaited down the tracks. To make way
for the passenger train, two long freights, one headed north and
one headed south, were switched off to a siding on the East side of
the main line, but the caboose and three cars of the southbound
train were still protruding onto the main line.
   Sim Webb the fireman first saw the caboose, shouted, and jumped
to safety. Casey Jones hit the emergency brakes but stayed with his
engine as it crashed into the rear cars of the freight and lunged
to the left, coming to rest pointing in the direction it came. A
bolt or a splinter of lumber pierced Jones in the throat. He was
taken on a stretcher to the depot a half-mile away, where he died
lying on a baggage wagon.
   In addition to Webb, three passengers, an American Express
messenger, and two postal clerks were slightly injured.

   ``All the crew safe, you say, and the passengers too?
   ``Thank God, that is clever,
   ``And his soft eyes closed as his pale face smiled
   ``And he whistled down brakes forever.''

   What went wrong? Webb said later he saw a flagman and heard the
torpedoes, explosive devices placed on the tracks to warn the
engineer, but Gurner contends Jones was ``short-flagged.''
   ``The flagman didn't get far enough back for Jones so see him in
time to stop,'' he says.
   Nonetheless, the railroad's investigation concluded that,
``Engineer Jones was solely responsible for the accident as a
consequence of not having responded to flag signals.''
   According to railroad records, the Illinois Central Railroad
awarded Webb $5 for his injuries. The messenger, who hurt his back,
got $23, and the two postal clerks $1 each.
   Why didn't Casey jump?
   ``That is really the hard one to answer,'' Gurner says. ``Once
the engineer puts the brake in emergency, reverses the engine and
opens the sanders, the engine has no further need of his services.''
   Even though Gurner insists Jones was a ``fine engineer,'' he
found railroad records that showed Jones had been suspended nine
times, for periods ranging from 5 days to 30 days, for safety
violations between Feb. 14, 1891 and May 22, 1899. The offenses
included such things as ``collision in Water Valley Yard,''
``running through switch at Carbondale,'' ``for not recognizing
flagman who was protecting work train.''
   Jones lived in Water Valley from 1893 to 1896. He moved his wife
and three sons back to Jackson, Tenn., at his wife's insistence,
but he retained his membership in the Water Valley lodge of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. Today there are Casey Jones
museums at Jackson and at Vaughan, where much of Gurner's
memorabilia is on display.
   Gurner, being from a family of railroaders, got interested in
railroad history and began taking pictures as a boy. In 1940 he
signed on as a machinist's apprentice at the Illinois Central shop
in Paducah, Ky., where the Water Valley shop had been transplanted.
He got to know men like Bob Moore, a retired engineer, and Bob
Ward, a retired shop man, who had known Casey Jones well.
   ``When they tore the old Water Valley depot down, I got this
wealth of old records that were being hauled off to the garbage
dump,'' Gurner says.
   But the railroad in Water Valley today is only a memory.
   ``They ran the last train in February of '82,'' Gurner says.
``They even took up the tracks. That was adding insult to injury.''
