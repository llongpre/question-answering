   Two railroad buffs were charged Monday with
taking a locomotive on a three-mile joyride at speeds of up to 50
mph before it derailed and tipped over, police said.
   James Schroedl, 20, and Eric Hoyem, 17, were charged with
burglary and criminal damage to property, said Detective Richard
Obermaier. Police located them through a pair of eyeglasses found
at the scene, he said.
   ``We visited optical stores until we found one that remembered
selling them to Schroedl,'' Obermaier said. ``They were a unique
presciption. The kid's almost blind.''
   ``They are railroad buffs. All their lives they've talked to
railroad guys and they learned enough to start the engine and get
it rolling,'' he said.
   Joyriders boarded the 1,500-horsepower freight locomotive at a
Chicago and Northwestern Railroad yard late Saturday, said railroad
spokesman Fred Bloedorn.
   The 25-year-old locomotive, valued at $100,000 to $150,000, fell
on its side, and the pair got out and ran off, Bloedorn said.
Obermaier estimated damage to the engine and tracks at $320,000.
   Police found Schroedl in a hospital with a leg injury suffered
in the derailment. He directed detectives to Hoyem, a high school
student, said Obermaier.
   Obermaier said the joyriders also apparently smashed windows,
broke into the yard office and damaged computer equipment as they
searched for a key to the locomotive.
