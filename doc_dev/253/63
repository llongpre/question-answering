   MOHAWK, N.Y. -- When he kicks the snow off a Delaware &amp;
Hudson railroad track in a freight yard here, Tom Waver, one
of the railroad's general managers, finds rotted wooden ties
and old steel rails. That, he tells a visitor, is why the
Delaware &amp; Hudson is going to undergo a massive rebuilding
project that he will supervise next spring.
   "We want to increase the capacity of this railroad to
handle a considerable amount of additional trains," he says.

   The fact that Mr. Waver expects the Delaware &amp; Hudson to
take on additional trains would seem the height of
unwarranted optimism, especially to those who know the frayed
railroad as the old Delay &amp; Hesitate.
   But last Friday the fate of the D&amp;H and, indeed, the
future of rail freight traffic in parts of the northeastern
U.S. and Canada changed drastically. Friday was the day
Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd. completed its $25
million purchase of the D&amp;H, bringing it out of bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The Canadian company's CP Rail unit is betting that the
D&amp;H can win back freight lost to trucks and capture a
substantial amount of the ocean containers moving between
Atlantic Coast ports and Canada. If it succeeds, Canadian
Pacific could alter shipping patterns in the Northeast and
challenge the grip that Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail) has
held on rail service and rates in the region.
   The acquisition will "change the railroad map, change the
way traffic moves and increase options for shippers," says
Francis Dicello, trustee of the Delaware &amp; Hudson estate.
   Not everyone is so confident. "I'm skeptical that the D&amp;H
can return a profit to the Canadian Pacific, because the same
chronic problems that put the D&amp;H under are still there,"
says William Withuhn, transportation curator of the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Adds Charles Marshall,
Conrail's senior vice president, development: "The
acquisition of the D&amp;H by a major system isn't in itself
magic."
   Failure is far from the minds of Canadian Pacific
executives, though. The D&amp;H "gets us into a marketplace
serving 48 million people," says Mr. Waver, a former CP Rail
deputy superintendent in Toronto. "That's twice as big as the
population of Canada in a compact area a twentieth the size."
   The 600-mile D&amp;H extends to Albany and Binghamton, N.Y.,
and Sunbury, Pa., from Montreal. It also holds important
trackage rights totaling 900 miles and allowing it to operate
its freight trains to northern New Jersey, Philadelphia,
Washington and Buffalo, N.Y.
   Some shippers expect to find a windfall in the merger.
Brojack Lumber Co., Montdale, Pa., is already switching some
freight to rail from trucks in anticipation of lower rail
rates spurred by competition between Conrail and a
strengthened D&amp;H. In the past the company was afraid to make
big commitments to using the Delaware &amp; Hudson. "The D&amp;H was
so iffy that I didn't know if it would be around tomorrow,"
says David Brojack, the company's sales manager.
   Steamship company executives believe a reinvigorated D&amp;H
could help the ports of New York and Philadelphia win cargo
destined for Canadian customers that is now routed through
Halifax, Nova Scotia. "The rail distance between Montreal and
Halifax is almost twice what it is between Montreal and New
York," says Timothy P. Collins, vice president of operations
at Hapag-Lloyd America, a container ship operator. If
Hapag-Lloyd and other ship companies reroute their Canadian
cargo the big loser could be Canadian National Railway, the
only rail line from Halifax. A Canadian National spokesman
said container traffic to and from Halifax is "important to
us and we will try some things to keep the traffic."
   Even port officials in Vancouver, British Columbia, on the
other side of the continent hope the merger will help them
win container shipments from Asia that currently go through
Seattle on the way to the Northeastern U.S. Gordon Chu,
marketing manager at Vancouver Port Corp., says that "for the
first time Vancouver will have direct rail access into the
Eastern seaboard of the U.S."
   Canadian Pacific executives also are counting on the
two-year-old Canada-U.S. free trade agreement to boost
freight traffic on the D&amp;H. The D&amp;H currently handles about
200 carloads of freight a day, far below traffic levels 30
years ago, when it moved upwards of 3,000 cars a day. CP Rail
officials acknowledge that the D&amp;H is losing about $500,000 a
day.
   But help is on the way. CP Rail, which has been operating
the D&amp;H since last August under an emergency order from the
Interstate Commerce Commission, already has infused the
railroad with new locomotives. The company plans to spend
nearly $50 million during the next 24 months to upgrade the
D&amp;H's tracks and replace faltering signal systems.
   Some rail workers are seeing improvements. Douglas Murray,
a machinist at the D&amp;H's Saratoga Springs, N.Y., yard, says
the railroad recently gave him some new tools. Previously,
the "only wrenches we had were the ones we brought from
home," he says. Adds Dick Sheehan, a locomotive engineer: "We
now have a good chance to bring the D&amp;H back to a first-class
competitive railroad, one the men won't be ashamed to work
for."
