<HEAD>Investigators Say Brakes Not Set On Rail Cars Involved In Collision</HEAD>

   Investigators looking into last week's train
collision and explosion say that no hand brakes were set on any of
the 48 runaway rail cars that rolled backwards for nine miles and
slammed into three locomotives.
   Edward Dobranetski, chief investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board, said it is not known yet why the hand
brakes were not used, and the ``human factor'' is being closely
scrutinized.
   Mike Lemm, Montana Rail Link trainmaster in Helena, said
preliminary tests show the train's air brakes, a separate braking
system that operates from within the locomotive, were working
properly. But more tests are under way, he said.
   Twenty-one cars derailed in the collision and one containing
hydrogen peroxide exploded, shattering windows up to two miles away
and hurling debris hundreds of yards.
   No serious injuries were reported but the explosion knocked out
power to much of the city of 37,000 and forced evacution of about
2,000 people when the temperature was about 30 degrees below zero.
   The train crew had detached the cars from the lead locomotive to
exchange it with another one containing a better heater, the Federal
Railroad Administration reported in its initial investigation last
Thursday, the day of the explosion.
   On Monday, Dobranetski said the cars were separated from the
locomotives after the lead engine lost power.
   He also said hand brakes are to be set if the train is on a steep
grade to serve as a backup to air brakes. The portion of track where
the train was disconnected is classified as ``mountain grade,'' he
said, adding that it appears the train crew violated railroad
regulations by failing to set the hand brakes.
   Investigators are still trying to determine whether
record-breaking cold played a part in the accident.
   ``Weather has an effect on any device,'' Dobranetski said. ``But
we are not sure yet what role it played in this accident.''
