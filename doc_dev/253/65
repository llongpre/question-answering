   A commuter railroad train rammed into a
tractor-trailer stuck at a crossing in this New York City suburb
and derailed, slightly injuring 18 of the 40 people aboard,
authorities said.
   The truck's driver waved in a frantic attempt to warn the
westbound Long Island Rail Road train's engineer, but stood clear
as the locomotive slammed into his truck Thursday evening,
witnesses said.
   ``It just pushed the trailer right on its side,'' said Bob
Morgan, who was working nearby.
   LIRR spokesman Mike Charles, asked if the train's engineer had
seen the driver waving, said the accident was being investigated.
   The locomotive flipped on its side and into a lumberyard next to
the tracks and five passenger coaches derailed, said Susan McGowan,
a railroad spokeswoman. The only part of the train left on the
tracks was a rear engine car.
   Two cars on a siding also derailed when they were sideswiped.
   The injured, who suffered sprains and minor cuts, were treated
at Huntington Hospital, said hospital administrator Ronald
Gaudreualt.
   No regular train service was scheduled today on the LIRR branch
from Huntington to Port Jefferson about 20 miles to the east.
