   Leftist guerrilla saboteurs blasted an ore
train off the tracks Thursday on the world's highest railroad line,
killing a conductor and injuring three other crew, police said.
   The saboteurs, believed to belong to the Maoist Shining Path
organization, exploded a 35-pound dynamite bomb as the dual
locomotive train roared past.
   Police in Huancayo, a major provincial capital 140 miles east of
Lima, said the blast sent the locomotives and all five cars
careening off the tracks.
   The train was hauling copper ore to a nearby refinery when it
was derailed near Carahuacra, a village in the high Andes Mountains
60 miles northwest of Huancayo, according to police.
   The attack occurred near the 15,700-foot summit of the highest
standard gauge railroad in the world.
   The conductor, riding in the lead locomotive, was killed and two
engineers and a signalman were injured.
   Police gave no damage estimate nor did they say how long it will
take to reopen the line, which links Lima with the highlands.
   Shining Path has blown up railroad bridges and sabotaged tracks
dozens of times, seeking to foment economic chaos. The mining
industry, which traditionally accounts for more than half of Peru's
foreign exchange, depends heavily on the line to transport minerals.
   Shining Path has waged a nine-year insurgency to install Marxist
rule. The government says more than 14,000 people have died in the
violence.
