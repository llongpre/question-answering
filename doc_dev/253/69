Engineer David Hodgson will never forget the 45 long minutes he spent locked
in the catacombs of Kensal Green Cemetery in west London. There were coffins
as far as he could see in every direction. His memory of the experience is
even more vivid because he had a bad cold at the time but had to suppress
all his sneezes. A service was in progress in the chapel directly above him
and he feared that some of the congregation might rapidly join the dead
below if they heard sneezes emerging from the depths.
Such a sound could easily have been heard, for in place of the hydraulic
catafalque that conveys coffins through the floor to their final resting
place there was a large void. The catafalque lay awaiting restoration in
Hodgson's workshop in the Derbyshire Dales and his task in the catacombs was
to examine the condition of the machinery that operates it. Cemetery
regulations dictated that he should be locked in the catacombs while
carrying out his work.
Hodgson runs the northern arm of Dorothea Restorations, a company that
specialises in engineering conservation work. Standing near the half tonne
catafalque structure in the Dorothea workshop at Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire
are several other monoliths from Britain's industrial past. They include
Locomotion - a 20-year-old replica of the engine that pulled the first
passenger trains on the Stockton to Darlington railway, an 1838 steam engine
that used to haul baggage trains on the Liverpool to Manchester line and a
100-year-old industrial diesel engine undergoing an overhaul for its owner,
Hull City Museum.
Dorothea had its origins in Bolton in the mid-1960s when four 16-year-old
schoolmates found themselves captivated by the huge engines, steam hammers,
heat and flames from the country's last working wrought iron works.
'To us it was the most exhilarating atmosphere. In our lunch hours and after
school we got to know the men at Walmsley's iron works who used to let us
help them and even drive the steam engines,' said Hodgson, 45.
The four - the others were Roger Lees, Chris Topp and Ted McAvoy - all went
off to different universities, but kept in touch.
When they graduated three years later, they remained convinced that their
mission was to conserve and preserve parts of Britain's industrial and
architectural heritage that they saw fast disappearing. Three found jobs in
different parts of the country and pooled some of their wages to support
Lees, the only mechanical engineer of the four, who was starting up
Dorothea.
The name came from a huge slate quarry in north Wales. On their meanderings
the four had discovered a fine old Cornish beam engine there. Although it
had not worked for more than a decade the engine was still in reasonable
order and the management was happy to let the four work on it at weekends,
while Lees remained on site during the week.
The idea was that the engine should form a means of attracting visitors to
tour the quarry, which was suffering hard times.
But the quarry closed and a development company bought the site with the
intention of turning part of it into a holiday complex. One of the main
attractions was to be a small industrial museum centred around the steam
engine. That scheme fell through, but the experience left the four with
enough confidence to set up a company doing what they had always wanted to
do: restoring old machinery and engines.
With the aid of a Pounds 300 overdraft from Lloyds bank, Dorothea
Restoration Engineers came into being in 1974 after the four had gained
further experience at the infant Ironbridge Gorge Museum and the North of
England Industrial Museum at Beamish near Newcastle-on-Tyne. The four had no
base; they met and worked at whatever site or project was employing them at
the time.
The work mainly involved horizontal, mill and winding engines, but in 1975
they were joined by Geoff Wallis, a mechanical engineer whom they had met
working at Ironbridge. His origins were in Bristol and he rapidly
established a western base, concentrating on architectural restoration work
based on wrought and cast iron. The same year the others rented a former
candle-wick mill at Kettleshulme in Cheshire. It served as a cheap operating
base while business grew, especially from the clutch of industrial museums
that followed Ironbridge and Beamish.
By the time Dorothea established a third base - a rented blacksmith's
workshop in Buxton - there were 20 employees. In 1976 they extended the
overdraft to Pounds 2,000 and bought a workshop in Bristol for Pounds
25,000. The current 6,000 sq ft Bristol works was bought for Pounds 137,000
in 1987. It is responsible for 60 per cent of the turnover of just over
Pounds 1m and is the base of 12 of the 23 employees.
In the late 1970s Dorothea moved its northern base from Kettleshulme to a
rented 2,000 sq ft engineering works at Whaley Bridge, near Macclesfield. By
then the company had four sites and 70 employees, and turnover was about
Pounds 250,000. But it was all too much.
'Administration was a nightmare, we had chronic cash flow problems, and the
business was still run by a committee,' Hodgson said. 'We had left the
civilised world of museums for the harsh realities of the construction
industry, where we faced all the problems of the sub-contractor. But we had
always been self-financed and we were determined to stay that way.'
They succeeded. In 1980, Topp volunteered to leave - he remained a director
 -and to run the smithy as a separate business, working closely with
Dorothea when the occasion arose. This relieved the company of one of the
four sites and some of the pressure.
The four then appointed David Maiden, an architect who had joined them, as a
director and and gave him a free hand. He put Hodgson in charge of the works
at Whaley bridge, while McAvoy continued with the potentially very
profitable business of making reproduction cast iron street furniture at
Buxton.
'From being on the point of collapse we turned Dorothea round.
The exercise served us in good stead for the leaner years of the late 80s
and 90s,' Hodgson said.
In 1984 the company accepted an outside consultant's report, and the street
furniture and new architectural metalwork sections split away completely.
Topp, Maiden and McAvoy departed to be directors of the new company of
Dorothea Ltd, and eventually sold out to an engineering conglomerate.
Hodgson, Lees and Wallis became directors of Dorothea Restorations Ltd.
So it has remained. For the past 10 years, in spite of the vicissitudes of
the building trade and cutbacks in museum funding the northern and southern
works have combined to make a modest 2 per cent profit.
'It's never huge - but we survive,' said Hodgson. 'Amazingly we have always
stayed in profit. In recent years there have been no redundancies. The
keynote has been steadiness and gradual reinvestment - especially in staff.'
Later this year Dorothea is dipping its toes into continental Europe for the
first time; the company is attending a trade fair in Amsterdam. It is also
tendering for a number of prestigious jobs, including some replacement
ironwork for the Albert Memorial. Hodgson is hoping to be able to add this
to a string of jobs they have completed for clients such as The National
Trust, English Heritage, the Royal Botanic gardens at Kew and the Palace of
Westminster.
The four original Bolton schoolboys are still the best of friends. McAvoy
runs an aluminium fabrication company near Whaley Bridge and undertakes work
for Dorothea on occasions, as does blacksmith Topp.
'Its nice to think that after all these years and many ups and downs we are
still firm friends,' Hodgson said. 'We all like to think we were pioneers
back in the 60s of the industrial and architectural heritage conservation
movement, to which, in our own ways, we are all still highly committed.'
