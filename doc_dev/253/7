<LEADPARA>  I STILL take Highway 9 or Lawrence Station Road south to Saratoga. I commute
on the Bayshore and talk about the Stanford Indians. You could either say that
I'm living in the past or maybe it's nostalgia or it could be that "thing"
about teaching old dogs new tricks. It's interesting what brings back
memories. Sometimes it's a smell or taste or just the right weather.;    Last
week's rail journey of a retired Southern Pacific steam locomotive from South
San Francisco down the Peninsula on its way to Sacramento, reminded me, fondly
I want you to know, of trips to The City on ugly, soot-stained cars with hard
seats and drinking "fountains" filled with warm water.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     About 2:15 last Wednesday afternoon engine No. 2472 huffed and puffed south
out of Mountain View. I had parked near the railroad tracks on the Mountain
View-Sunnyvale border for a couple of hours to catch a glimpse of the train,
at one point thinking that it had already passed by before I got there. A call
to CalTrain confirmed that it hadn't.;    "It was supposed to be in Mountain
View around noon," a CalTrain information operator told me. "It's running
late.";    The 70-year old locomotive, weighing more than half a million
pounds, retired in 1957 from a career that included near-daily operation on
the Southern Pacific Peninsula commute line. I waited patiently, figuring that
if I'd been retired 30 years ago I'd be a little late, too.;    The locomotive
was passing by Peninsula cities, heading for the bend in San Jose to go
northeast to Railfair '91, an exposition of restored locomotives and cars that
began last weekend in Old Sacramento. If you've never been to Old Sacramento
you've missed a fun excursion to a restoration of what was the town of
Sacramento during the gold rush. Located not far from the state capitol (J
Street off-ramp from Interstate 5), Old Sacramento is home to the California
State Railroad Museum, the largest of its type in the world and centerpiece
for Railfair '91.;    Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to Sacramento
for the fair. The closest I'll come were those seconds while I stood along the
railroad track and watched an enormous piece of history rumble by.;    A lot
of memories passed with the locomotive. I think it was 1955 when I made my
first round trip to San Francisco from Sunnyvale. You knew the train was
coming by the whistle in the distance, as the train crossed intersecting roads
and streets. Maybe it was the whistle last Wednesday, or maybe it was the oily
smell in the air as the engine passed. Whatever it was, it made me long for a
less congested farm atmosphere on the Peninsula and those occasional trips to
The City.;    As a passenger car being pulled by the locomotive disappeared
down the tracks, I got back in my car, drove down Evelyn Avenue, and as I
jogged around to Castro Street and bumper-to-bumpered it to El Camino, the
memories of the mid-'50s began to fade.;    Engine No. 2472 is now a memory
that will take a smell or taste or just the right weather to recall.;   
Ticket to ride;    Railfair '91 runs through May 12, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.;   
Tickets are available from BASS/Ticketmaster outlets and the Sacramento
Convention Center box office at (916) 442-7827.;    General admission for
access to Railfair '91, including the California State Railroad Museum, is $12
for adults, $5 for children 5-12, 4 and under free.;    A musical revue is
held daily at 11 a.m., 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets are $7 for adults, $5 for
children. Because of limited parking nearby, public transportation is
recommended.;    For Sacramento transit information, phone (916) 321-BUSS.  </TEXT>
