   A locomotive crashed into a train of
passenger cars carrying sightseers on a tour of the historic
Klondike gold-rush trail, injuring 40 people, officials said
Thursday.
   None of the passengers were seriously injured in the accident
Wednesday. All rejoined their tour group aboard the cruise ship SS
Viking Serenade in Juneau on Thursday, said Paul Taylor, vice
president of the White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad.
   The accident happened after the train, carrying 170 people on an
excursion trip from Skagway, reached the top of the 2,800-foot
White Pass summit on the Canadian side of the border.
   The locomotive was preparing to re-couple with the passenger
cars for the return trip when it apparently failed to slow down and
rammed into the cars, Taylor said.
   Thirty passengers were treated at the Skagway medical clinic and
released. Another 10 were flown by small airplane to Juneau, about
100 miles south.
   The narrow-gauge railway was built in 1900 during the gold rush.
About 70,000 passengers ride the train to White Pass annually.
   Taylor said an investigator from the Canadian National
Transportation Agency would arrive Friday to investigate the crash.
