<F P=106> [Article by G. Osipov, deputy chief of the Locomotive </F>
Service of the October Railroad: "Today Spare Parts, but 
Tomorrow?...."] 
  [Text] The locomotive fleet is growing old. It is 
virtually impossible to replace the machines that have worked 
out their life under the conditions of the production slump and 
the severance of ties with the enterprises of the near abroad, 
and indeed, it is to no purpose. How can the available machines 
do their work and how long will there be enough of them? 
  All the problems of the diesel locomotive fleet (and on the 
October Railroad it is the predominant one) can be clearly seen 
from the example of one of the major enterprises on the network 
-- the Volkhovstroy Locomotive Depot. In 1988, 135 freight 
locomotives were maintained here. With the reduction in the 
transport volume, some of the machines were transferred to the 
Petrozavodsk Depot. Now only 70 are left at Volkhovstroy. In 
order to keep them in good working condition, they have been 
assigned to locomotive and comprehensive repair brigades. What 
is more, the personnel selected are quite qualified, experienced 
people, and make it possible to maintain the diesel locomotives 
at the necessary level. Moreover, they introduced a set of 
equipment here for technical diagnosis of the locomotives. 
  No matter how they cared for them, though, the machines 
naturally get out of order. The TE10 is obsolete. Its D100 
diesel, developed at the dawn of diesel locomotive traction, 
does not guarantee reliable work. 
  The M62 diesel locomotive, developed in its time for 
railroads in European countries and intended for light, or 
rather, export work, found itself on Russia's difficult proving 
grounds. On the Volkhovstroy-Petrozavodsk-Kem and 
Volkhovstroy-Cherepovets sections, it had a hard time pulling 
four-five-thousand tonne consists. This locomotive is in general 
not suited for intensive hauling of such consists. In the future 
it will be even worse, for after all, the diesel locomotives are 
wearing out. For example 130 M62 machines have been in operation 
on the October Railroad for 20 years now, and another 57 M62 
diesel locomotives will reach this milestone in two years. 
Series TE10 and M62, with low-power diesels, are unreliable in 
operation, not to mention the fact that they are uneconomical 
and do not meet ecological requirements. They should be replaced 
immediately! Only, with what? 
  Operations workers will still be able to work on these 
diesel 
locomotives for some time, but this will cost them a pretty 
penny. The TEP70, TEM7 and 2TE116 diesel locomotives are 
equipped with more powerful diesels. They rarely break down en 
route, are more economical and ecologically cleaner -- they do 
not have fuel or oil leaks, nor other harmful emissions. 
  The thought comes to mind: why not put more powerful 
four-stroke diesels on the TE10 and M62 locomotives? Even under 
the present crisis conditions, there are plants with enough 
technical potential to manufacture them. They manufacture 5D49 
diesels at Penza and Kolomna, and can make them at Bryansk. The 
collectives of these enterprises would be glad to have our 
orders. Incidentally, there is experience in this. GUDOK 
reported on what happened in Germany when the time came to 
exchange the diesels on the diesel locomotives. They did not 
write off the machines for scrap metal there, but announced a 
competition, in which the best known diesel locomotive building 
firms would take part. The managers gave their preference to our 
Kolomna Plant. It is a pity that we have not proved to be so 
enterprising! 
  Under the conditions of the breakdown in economic relations, 
we must set up direct cooperation with enterprises. For example, 
we have a good business contact with the Lyudinovo Plant, which 
performs capital repair of TEM7 diesel locomotives. We sent a 
TEP70 to the Kolomna Diesel Locomotive Building Plant after 
eight years of operation, and hope that they will do a good job 
of renovating it. These direct ties with the plants are 
advantageous to the railroad. 
  We have to work within the limits of our technical 
potentials. For example, last year, at the Volkhovstroy Depot, 
we plagued the life out of them with a mass of chips on the 
wheelpairs, caused by a multitude of track defects. We had to 
machine 672 wheelpairs in the spring. We did not manage to do 
this completely. Complications came up on the road. The 
Petrozavodsk Depot had to machine the wheelpairs of the TE10MU 
diesel locomotives because the wheel tires were worn, and the 
time has come to do this on the 2TE116 as well. How could we 
operate if we had only 120 wheelpairs for the whole fleet of 390 
sections! 
  The road is in debt. Plant prices for capital repair are 
becoming inaccessible. So we have had to handle this work 
ourselves. Last year we carried out capital repair of the first 
batch of over 20 sections. This year we plan to put 75 sections 
in good working order this way. At the same time, the quality of 
the depot work is in no way inferior to that of the plants. This 
is the limit, though, our technical base is not highly 
developed, and it became possible to perform capital repair only 
when there was a reduction in the demand for "hoisting" because 
of the drop in transport volume. 
  The Byborg Depot also had to do hoisting repair. We hope 
that 
we will be able to repair 48 sections of the M62 diesel 
locomotive there. This will make it possible to fully guarantee 
the road's need for this type of work in the next two years. 
  There is one special feature here, though: diesel locomotive 
equipment, which we used to get from the MPS [Ministry of 
Railways] main administrations through our requisitions, now, 
just like spare parts, is ordered by the road's 
material-technical supply service. But the road doesn't have the 
money to get it. As a result, the diesel locomotive fleet has 
found itself without turbines, reducing gears, small electric 
motors, wheelpairs and diesels. We can still get some of these, 
but on the road the clearing accounts for capital repair are 
proceeding according to an "advice note," and this type of 
purchase requires "real" money. 
  The plants of the former Ministry of Heavy, Transport and 
Power Machine Building and some of those of our former TsTVR 
[Main Administration for Locomotive Repair Plants of the USSR 
Ministry of Railways] became joint-stockholding companies. They 
work only for cash or with pre-payment. This stumps the railroad. 
  Just what will happen to the diesel locomotive fleet on the 
October Railroad? 
  About 60 TEP60 diesel passenger locomotives will be operated 
up to the year 2005. Only the Poltava Plant will perform their 
capital repair. We on the October can do only the hoisting, and 
do only one section a month of that. 
  We have 115 TEP70 diesel locomotives. Ten of them need 
capital repair this year. This is possible. But after that, the 
process of locomotive wear will increase. There is a danger that 
the Kolomna Plant will not stretch to this work. Indeed, we have 
no money for it. I think that the MPS should give the road 
permission to perform routine second and third phase repair. We 
can absolutely cope with this. The mileage norms established by 
the manufacturing plant should remain. The problem of the 
technological reserve of wheelpairs and electric traction 
engines must also be solved (so far no one is doing this in 
Russia). 
  Even though we have found a temporary way out for spare 
parts 
for the series M62 machines and its modification -- we dismantle 
old locomotives -- industry should in no case curtail their 
production, or else these locomotives will be laid up everywhere. 
  We can still operate the Hungarian diesel trains for about 
five or six years. After that they will have to be replaced, 
since there are no spare parts for their repair. This problem 
must be solved as soon as possible. 
  I think that other roads that have a large diesel locomotive 
fleet are experiencing the same difficulties that we are. We 
have one task: together with the ministry, draw outside 
enterprises more widely into the production of spare parts, 
engines, assemblies and units. The diesel locomotive fleet must 
be saved.
