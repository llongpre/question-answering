   Two freight trains collided about two
miles east of downtown, setting locomotives on fire and forcing the
brief evacuation of an estimated 200 people, officials said.
   Crews worked through the night to right the 22 freight cars and
five locomotives derailed in the Wednesday evening wreck.
   Two firefighters and a police officer were treated for smoke
inhalation at Flagstaff Regional Medical Center and released,
officials said.
   The eastbound Santa Fe trains collided when one failed to slow
for the other at a point where parallel tracks cross, said state
Corporation Commission spokesman Jon Poston.
   A fireball erupted from one of the diesel locomotive, then the
fire spread to other engines, said police Sgt. Pasqual Macias.
   ``Some of those engines were embedded into the ground, and they
were strewn all over _ some right side up, some perpendicular to
the track,'' said Fire Department Capt. Paul Hellenberg. Some of
the locomotives went down a 20-foot embankment, Hellenberg said.
   The evacuation of homes and businesses on the east side was
called off about two hours later because shipping manifests showed
there was no hazardous material near the fire.
   One car was loaded with explosives and another contained a
flammable liquid or gas, but neither derailed, said Hellenberg.
   Two streets were closed, but they reopened after the fire was
put out.
   The accident ripped out about 100 feet of railroad track,
Hellenberg said.
