   The National Transportation Safety Board today
blamed the crew of a Montana Rail Link freight train for failing to
secure the brakes before a crash and chemical explosion that forced
evacuation of 2,000 people in subfreezing Helena last winter.
   The board also cited as contributing to the accident the
decision of an engineer to rearrange the train's locomotives while
leaving the cars unattended on a mountain grade; the effects of the
cold that reached a wind-chill factor of minus-70 degrees at the
time of the Feb. 2 crash; and inadequate training by the railroad
management.
   The board, voting 4-0, issued several recommendations to the
railroad, to Burlington Northern Railroad which owned the tracks,
the Federal Railraod Administration, the Association of American
Railroads and the city of Helena.
   The independent safety board determines probable cause of
accidents and makes recommendations for improving safety but has no
statutory or police authority.
   Cars from the train, which had been making its way up a long
mountain grade en route to Spokane, Wash., coasted backwards nine
miles into Helena and hit another train and a propane tank. Flames
from the propane explosion ignited one of the derailed cars, which
contained highly flammable chemical.
   The NTSB noted that the release of hazardous materials
contributed to the severity of the 4:48 a.m. crash, in which no one
was killed or seriously injured. Damage was estimated at $6
million, not including several private homes that suffered broken
windows and other damage.
   Board investigators said the crew of the train failed to
properly secure train brakes after disconnecting cars so they could
rearrange engines that were helping the train up the long grade
toward the Continental Divide.
   The decision to move the engines was made after the heater and
then the engine failed in the lead locomotive.
