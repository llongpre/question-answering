FAIRVIEW REGIONAL PARK

Fairview Regional Park's undeveloped, historic parkland is home to 
remote-control gliders, miniature train rides and a multipurpose trail. As a 
recreational area, the bluff-top park along the Santa Ana River in Costa Mesa 
is spacious and uncluttered, offering plenty of room to try out all the new 
toys received over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Listed in the National Registry of Historic Places, Fairview is thought to be 
one of the most valuable archeological sites in Orange County. Over the past 30 
years, archeologists have uncovered tools, house floors, hearths and cogged 
stones from the site that date back 3,000 years. (Cogged stones are associated 
with an Indian religious cult that flourished along the Santa Ana River.) 
</P>
<P>
"Fairview was developed as a 'passive' park, which means that the land is not 
developed for any one specific use," said Dave Alkema, superintendent of Costa 
Mesa's Parks and Recreation Department. "The first phase of the park, including 
some revegetation, is completed and we're reviewing the park's Master Plan to 
determine the priority needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Proposals requesting permission to install athletic fields will be raised at 
meetings after the first of the year. Representatives of youth soccer leagues, 
Little League and Pop Warner Football have all expressed a desire to develop a 
sports complex on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the throes of (deciding) what we want to do at Fairview Park," Alkema 
said. "At first, we ran into money problems, but this year we got a little 
funding from the state. As soon as the city decides the best use of the land, 
we'll get going on the Phase II." 
</P>
<P>
While it appears that the second phase will involve turning undeveloped land 
into grass-covered sports fields, one group will not be affected by the 
changing landscape. 
</P>
<P>
More interested in the air above the park rather than the ground, 
remote-control plane pilots flock to Fairview Park to loop-the-loop, lured by 
afternoon thermals blowing off the shoreline. The park site is quickly becoming 
one of the most frequented mini-airports for the county's avid model plane 
aviators. 
</P>
<P>
Another group dedicated to playing in the park is the Orange County Model 
Engineers. Located on the east side of Placentia Avenue, the nonprofit club is 
building the miniature Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction Railroad, named to 
honor historical monikers for Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. About 700 feet of 
temporary track have been laid to carry live steamers -- working scale models 
of full-sized steam locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
The club offers free rides to the public on every third full weekend of the 
month. Upon completion, the railroad will include 2,800 feet of track that will 
cross a 96-foot-long bridge. Members hope to have the project completed by 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next few years," said Ben Viola, a Midway City resident whose Santa 
Fe locomotive pulls about 90% of the passengers, "Fairview Park will have one 
of the finest sites in the county for live steamers." 
</P>
<P>
If new bicycles or running shoes are the toys of choice, a trail cuts through 
the raw parkland, crossing a man-made bridge and connecting with the Santa Ana 
River Trail two miles east of Huntington State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fairview Regional Park offers adults and children alike ample space to frolic 
with Fido or to take a ride on the Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction 
Railroad.
