   Call this a gold rush town, and no one
will argue. The window displays of miners' picks and gold pans, the
restored bawdy houses and the can-can dancers all say ``Klondike.''
   But since the cars of the White Pass &amp; Yukon railroad rolled out
of town Thursday and up the Trail of '98 for the first time in more
than five years, Skagway's gotten back what locals consider its
real image.
   ``It gives us our identity back. Skagway's always been a
railroad town,'' says Gary Danielson, a train man turned city
tourism director.
   For 82 years after its completion in 1900, the White Pass &amp;
Yukon was the life of Skagway. It carried freight, miners and
tourists from this seaport town up through the White Pass of the
Coast Mountains, to the Yukon Territory of Canada. While other gold
rush boom towns died and disappeared, Skagway prospered with its
railroad.
   The bust came in June 1982. With closure of the Yukon's
Cyprus-Anvil lead and zinc mine, the railroad lost its cargo and
three-quarters of its revenues. It closed a few months later.
   The town of 800 people lost 150 jobs, and in the decline that
followed, nearly half its population.
   ``For a lot of people it was, face it: If you're going to live
in Skagway, you're going to draw unemployment,'' recalls Lee
Hartson, one of those suddenly left jobless.
   Hartson left town to work on the Alaska Railroad in Anchorage,
at U.S. Customs and a few other jobs.
   Many railroad families stayed in Skagway, but the town lost its
pride, says Dawn Nelson, an 11-year resident.
   ``Up until the train quit running, we could say we were a
railroad town. And that has a different connotation than being just
a tourist town,'' Nelson says.
   Now she listens for the shrill whistle of Engine No. 73 as it
rolls down the tracks a few blocks from the dress shop where she
works _ the sound that says all's well again in Skagway.
   ``Hearing that steam whistle blow was a part of our lives, part
of every day,'' she says. ``It sounds wonderful.''
   Hartson's living by the whistle as well, back as conductor since
the White Pass &amp; Yukon was reborn as a tourist attraction.
   At least twice a day, he'll be loading passengers at the cruise
ship docks for a three-hour ride along the tracks that shadow the
Deadhorse Trail, the path that once wore out men and killed their
horses.
   The White Pass steams at a steady 15 mph up the gorge of the
Skagway River, past the grave of ``Soapy'' Smith, legendary badman
of the gold rush barrooms, and past the White Pass ghost town where
thousands once rested before their final assent to the summit and
the Canadian border _ 20.4 miles and 2,865 vertical feet from the
seaside depot.
   From the snow-packed cliff above the summit's Deadhorse Gulch,
where the train turns around, there's little to see but much to
sense.
   ``Trail of '98'' says the marker, the only break in a landscape
of snow and rock and stunted spruce. The snow, head-high in May,
shrouds the bones of more than 3,000 pack animals driven to death
by the Klondike-bound in the winter of 1897 and 1898.
   There's a sense of the dead and the desperate in the rock walls
of White Pass. But it's a living history that Steve Hites is
peddling as he sashays through the cars of the White Pass &amp; Yukon
in turn-of-the-century garb.
   ``These wooden parlor cars, they're works of art. They're museum
pieces,'' says Hites, who started as a baggage handler in 1972 and
now is the railroad's promotion man.
   As other narrow-gauge railroads were abandoned throughout North
America, White Pass collected cars dating to 1883. The gypsy-wagon
roof shapes _ turtlebacks and clerestories to railroad buffs _
cover art deco interiors complete with ornate stoves.
   The first White Pass coaches, four flatbeds with benches,
carried local celebrities to the end of the line, then four miles
from town, on July 21, 1898.
   Miners immediately began buying rides along the half-built line
to escape the brutal path below, but granite, weather and an
unsteady work force delayed the line's completion two more years.
   Miners laid iron whenever they were broke, then abandoned the
tracks when they got enough pay to make a run for the gold fields.
   ``There was the old joke about the White Pass having three
crews: the crew that had left, the crew that was thinking of
leaving, and the crew that was being brought in,'' Hites says.
   The last spike on the White Pass was driven in Carcrosse, Yukon,
on July 29, 1900.
   By 1901, the White Pass was in the tourism business, selling
eight-day luxury excursions from Seattle to Dawson, Yukon, by
steamship, railway and riverboat.
   The future, Hites says, is still uncertain. The line needs
50,000 passengers a year, at $67 a head, to stay in business. Hites
won't know until next year if that's realistic.
   In Skagway, they aren't worried.
   The population's topping 700 again, almost 250,000 tourists are
expected this year, and Danielson says two more cruise ships have
promised to come in 1989 because of the railroad.
   ``It gives us the anchor that we need,'' Danielson said. ``It
seems like we have everything back again.''
