   Two freight trains collided head on
Saturday, killing two crew members, and about 1,000 residents were
evacuated because of fears that two overturned tank cars could
explode, authorities said.
   Two men saved themselves by leaping from their locomotive before
the crash.
   A hazardous-chemical emergency team rushed to the site in a corn
field outside this suburb northeast of Des Moines after the noon
crash of two Iowa Interstate trains. Authorities said they feared a
fire would touch off tank cars containing denatured alcohol.
   A state official said a small fire was burning on top of one of
the tank cars, but officials intended to let it burn itself out.
   ``You can see flames every now and then coming out of the top
port,'' said Jerry Ostendorf, operations manager of the state
division of disaster services.
   A railroad official said authorities were evacuating an area
within 1.5 miles of the wreck site, which includes at least 1,000
people. But at an amusement park two miles away, an estimated 9,000
people were allowed to continue riding attractions.
   ``It's just a safety precaution,'' said Anthony Bacino,
hazardous materials officer for Iowa Interstate. ``It's a
possibility that the liquid could expand and cause the cars to
explode.
   ``They would take off like a rocket _ they could go a mile.''
   The evacuation could last up to 24 hours, Bacino said.
   He said safety valves on the cars so far appeared to be
functioning to prevent an explosive buildup of pressure inside the
cars.
   The two trains had a total of 86 cars. Ten were derailed and
four overturned, Bacino said.
   Polk County Sheriff's Lt. David Long said both of the dead
trainmen were aboard a westbound freight train and that the crew of
the other train managed a last-minute escape and were only slightly
injured.
   ``The two on the eastbound train jumped off before the
collision,'' he said. ``Those on the westbound train did not
(jump). We still have not been able to recover the bodies.''
   Long said it was too early to know for sure why the trains were
on the same track.
   Diesel fuel spilling from the locomotives caused minor grass
fires, which were soon brought under control.
   Long said the fumes from denatured alcohol are toxic and
explosive.
   The Iowa Interstate took over some of the tracks formerly
operated by the Rock Island Railroad several years ago.
   At nearby Adventureland Park, president Jack Krantz said he had
been assured by the Polk County sheriff's department that it was
safe to continue normal operations. He estimated the crowd Saturday
at about 9,000.
   Michelle Bliss, an emergency medical technician who lives a
quarter mile from the crash, went to the scene after hearing the
crash.
   ``We could see the flames shooting in the air,'' she said. ``The
engines were a mangled mess.''
   Gov. Terry Branstad went to the scene late Saturday and told
reporters that Altoona residents were lucky the crash was outside
city limits.
