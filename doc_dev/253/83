  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The government convened 
an emergency meeting Friday to discuss preventing a nationwide 
strike by railroad and subway workers. 
  Vice ministers of the Labor and Transportation Ministries 
and 
the Economic Planning Board decided to announce government 
measures to provide better working conditions, under which 
locomotive engineers and ticket inspectors would receive similar 
treatment as general clerical workers at the Korean National 
Railroad. 
  The government, however, made clear it would not negotiate 
with "Chonkihyop," [The National Council of Locomotive 
Engineers] a nationwide organization of locomotive and train 
engineers, as it is an unauthorized body separate from the 
Railroad Labor Union. 
  At the same time, the government decided to take strong 
action, including the prosecution of those involved, if the 
workers go ahead with the strike despite measures to improve 
labor conditions such as a wage hike. 
  Chonkihyop members have sided with the labor unions of the 
Seoul and Pusan subways in resolving to walk out. 
  Earlier, the Labor Ministry warned in a statement the 
government would not tolerate a joint strike by railroad and 
subway workers as it would foster social unrest. 
  Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui said Friday the government has 
completed preparations for judicial action against leaders of 
Chonkihyop and Chonodae [National Conference of Representatives 
of the Workers' Cooperatives], a private organization of labor 
union representatives nationwide. 
  Minister Nam stressed the two organizations are voluntary 
and 
private organizations which are not recognized legally, saying 
their resolution on a walk-out is an apparent violation of the 
law. He said the government is preparing a wage increase and 
better labor conditions for locomotive engineers and railroad 
workers through negotiations with the authorized labor union of 
the Korean National Railroad.
