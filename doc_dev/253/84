   The chairman of Amtrak said Tuesday he is
confident the passenger railroad will survive and gain the support
of the next president, whether Democrat or Republican.
   ``Congress has rejected ... proposals to terminate Amtrak for
four successive years,'' W. Graham Claytor told reporters, referring
to repeated attempts by the Reagan administration to end federal
subsidies for the railroad.
   Amtrak is expected to get about $580 million in federal money
next year but will cover two-thirds of its operating costs through
various revenue sources, Claytor said. Only 48 percent of the rail
system's costs were covered by revenues in 1981, he said.
   The administration repeatedly has called for an end to federal
subsidies for Amtrak, but each time Congress has continue to provide
the rail system with reduced amounts of money.
   ``Today ... things are looking better,'' said Claytor, expressing
optimism about getting the additional federal funds in future years
that will allow Amtrak to begin expanding its operations.
   He said he expects either Democrat Michael Dukakis or Vice
President George Bush to support Amtrak if elected president,
although Bush has yet to say specifically whether he would favor
increased funding for the railroad.
   Claytor said his key objective is to have both the Democratic and
Republican parties go on record as supporting the continuing need
for a national passenger rail system. ``I'm optimistic this will be
the position of a new administration, whether Republican or
Democratic,'' he said.
   While in recent years Amtrak has battled for its survival,
Claytor talked during a session with reporters at the National Press
Club about expanding services in the years to come.
   ``The principal problem we see ahead is capacity. ... On weekends
and hoidays we don't have the equipment to accommodate peak loads on
our unreserved Northeast Corridor trains'' between Boston and
Washington, he said.
   Claytor said that for the first time in recent years Amtrak has
been on firm enough footing politically to obtain financing for new
locomotives and train cars.
   He said Amtrak has arranged financing for the purchase of 18 new
diesel and electric locomotives and up to 100 new coach cars. ``The
locomotives are now being delivered and the first 50 coaches will be
on hand in 12 to 15 months,'' he said.
