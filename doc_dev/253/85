   A head-on collision between a freight train
and a large rail-maintenance unit caused a spectacular fire, more
than $500,000 in damage and the 12-hour shutdown of an Amtrak
passenger route, officials said.
   Braking problems on a rail grinder, a heavy unit about two
locomotives long that was being operated by a contractor, apparently
led to the accident Friday evening, Howard Kallio of Burlington
Northern Railroad said Saturday.
   All three locomotives and some of the approximately 35 cars on
the freight train were destroyed, Kallio said. He estimated damage
at $530,000 to the engines, cars and tracks.
   Firefighters battled flames that sent up a column of smoke
visible five miles. Four workers suffered minor injuries in the
crash, hospital officials said.
   The eastbound freight train was traveling about 50 mph when the
collision occurred, while the rail grinder pulling 10 cars was
westbound at about 20 mph, Kallio said.
   They crashed when the rail grinder failed to stop before a point
where two sets of track converge, he said.
   Crew members were given urinalysis tests as required under
federal law, but ``it appears that (the grinder) must have lost some
braking capacity,'' he said.
   Kallio said he did not know the extent of damage to the rail
grinder, used once or twice a year on heavily traveled tracks to
remove rough spots from the top and sides of the rails.
   Passengers from two trains _ one westbound and one eastbound _
were bused between Wenatchee and Spokane before the tracks were
reopened between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. Saturday, he said. About 20
residents were evacuated briefly from homes about a mile from the
crash site.
