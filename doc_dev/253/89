FT  12 MAY 94 / BR sells charter Pullman unit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail is to sell its charter and special train unit, which hires
Pullman-style carriages pulled by steam and diesel locomotives, to Flying
Scotsman Railways.
BR will hand over the six locomotives and 200 passenger and sleeping coaches
in April when it has completed its present charter programme. This will give
Flying Scotsman, owned by record producer Pete Waterman, time to acquire the
licences it will need to operate the rolling stock.
Mr Waterman, a former locomotive boilerman, helped singers such as Kylie
Minogue and Rick Astley to international stardom.
