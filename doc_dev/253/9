   An insurance salesman whose phone
number was mistakenly listed in a pizza ad says even though he makes
a pretty good home-cooked pizza, he isn't ready to deliver.
   Hank Foiles says his telephone has been going non-stop since
Pizza Hut mailed out an ad last week to thousands of homes.
   Calls from hungry customers began Thursday night, but they didn't
hit a peak until Friday afternoon.
   ``Since 4:30, there's been a call about every two minutes,''
Foiles said Friday. Not one was a personal call.
   He said Pizza Hut had assured him the problem would be corrected,
but company officials declined to comment.
   Pizza Hut offered to put an answering machine on Foiles' line to
refer callers to the correct number, he said. In the meantime,
friends trying to reach Foiles will have to rely on his business
telephone line.
   ``The manager told me, `If you want to leave for the weekend and
go somewhere else and check in, we'll take care of it for you,'''
Foiles said. ``They offered to keep me and my friends in pizza for a
year, or me for life.''
   But Foiles said he likes his own home-cooked pizza just fine.

   A vintage steam locomotive, whose last run 36
years ago almost led to the scrapyard, will return to the rails next
month.
   Engine No. 290 is ready for a new assignment, hauling tourists
and railroad buffs on trips around the city and beyond.
   The inaugural run between Atlanta and Macon is set for Sept. 10.
   The thunder of the engine's 6-foot driving wheels hasn't been
heard in decades, since No. 290 pulled the crack Crescent Limited
passenger train between Atlanta and Montgomery. So steam buffs are
hailing the restored engine's pending debut as a chapter in a battle
against indifference, rust and neglect.
   ``I grew up in the steam era, and to see her back under steam is
going to be an accomplishment,'' said Charlie Strike, president of
the Atlanta chapter of the National Railway Historical Society _ now
the engine's owner.
   ``I don't know any kid, young or old, that doesn't get a rise out
of seeing a steam engine thundering by,'' he said.
   Restoration of No. 290 has been a joint effort of the society and
the Georgia Building Authority, which mostly manages state office
buildings but also runs the ``New Georgia Railroad,'' offering
regularly scheduled trips around the city and to state-owned Stone
Mountain over existing, commercial tracks.
   Once No. 290 is under steam, the engine will alternate with New
Georgia's other steam engine _ the smaller and older No. 750 _ and
its stable of four diesels in providing front-end power for trips.
   Built in 1926, No. 290 was slated for the scrap heap when the
diesel age dawned in earnest following World War II. The engine's
last run was in 1953.
