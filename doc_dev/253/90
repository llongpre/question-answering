<TEXT>     CalTrain was shut down, forcing 11,000 daily commuters between San Jose and
San Francisco onto buses or into their cars -- the result of the first
nationwide rail strike in nearly a decade.;    That doesn't count the unknown
number who threw up their hands in disgust and went back home.;    Though the
striking unions work on freight lines, service was disrupted on many Amtrak
trains and commuter lines such as those in the Bay Area that share tracks with
freight carriers. The conductors, engineers and ticket sellers on the commuter
lines are members of one of the bargaining unions.;    The toll was reflected
in sad looks, sleepy eyes and harried commuters who raced after cars whose
drivers had dropped them off at the Cahill Station in San Jose, mistakenly
thinking it was business as usual.;    They weren't helped by the fact that
there were no pickets or any other signs at the depot advising commuters that
the trains were not running.;    An unidentified woman was dropped off at the
Cahill depot this morning, then told the trains weren't running. She was last
seen frantically waving at her ride. Fortunately, the driver stopped and she
tore across the parking lot and got back in the car.;    Jeannette Schreiber,
a sophomore at St. Francis High School in Mountain View, wasn't so lucky.;   
She sat on the station curb doing her homework and waiting for mom, who
minutes earlier had dropped her off, only to get home and find her daughter's
message on the answering machine: Come back and get me.;    "We don't watch
the news in the morning," Schreiber said. "We're too busy.";    CalTrain
official Eric Schatmeier conceded there aren't very many alternatives for
commuters. "We are directing people to parallel bus service, but those aren't
really very high-capacity services.;    Last-ditch contract talks between
freight railroads and unions representing 235,000 workers broke off Tuesday
evening in Washington. The issue: a 3-year-old dispute about wages, work rules
and health care costs.;    Yet most CalTrain commuters apparently had gotten
the word that the trains weren't running because the parking lot was nearly
empty and the few people who showed up at the Cahill station had contingency
plans.;    For Maria Velasco, who usually takes the 7:04 a.m. train to San
Bruno, it meant showing up about 5:45 a.m. to catch a bus, figuring it would
take two to three hours to reach her destination.;    Terry McColman, who
normally takes the 5:20 a.m. train to his job at San Francisco Federal
Savings, stood outside the depot this morning to "see if I can get some people
together and car pool." But there weren't many other people around.;    Paul
Sanderson stood on the curb waiting for a friend who normally rides the train.
They arranged a car pool a couple of days ago even though the train crews had
placed fliers on the seats Tuesday informing passengers the trains would be
running unless Southern Pacific decided to shut them down.;    "I blame SP,"
Sanderson said.;    John Alter, who had bused over from Santa Cruz, missed
radio reports that the trains weren't running. He was trying to figure out how
to get downtown to take the light rail to Santa Clara in hopes he could find a
bus for the rest of his trip to Sunnyvale.;    And G. Edward Smith, who
normally takes a CalTrain connector -- a small bus -- to Santa Cruz, was
philosophical when it didn't appear this morning.;    He settled onto a
waiting room bench and watched for the bus that goes to Santa Cruz at 7:05
a.m. But, he said ruefully, his regular connection takes only 35 to 40 minutes
and the later bus takes 90 minutes.;    A one-page flier from the United
Transportation Union said that workers had "requested and received from our
international headquarters permission to continue to operate the Peninsula
commute trains. However, there is nothing we can do if we are locked out by
the railroad.";    Richard Cota, a representative from the Transportation
Communications International Union, which represents the clerks, said he had
no idea why SP wasn't running the trains.;    "That was the railroad's
decision," he said. "There's no pickets.";    Conductors, engineers and other
workers stood around waiting to run the trains that were just standing idle in
the yard.;    The Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) added 36 cars to the
system to handle any increase, said spokesman Sy Mouber.;    BART trains don't
run through San Mateo County, but Mouber expected some commuters to cross the
two bridges that span the bay in the south and then board a BART train,
probably in Hayward or Fremont, that heads for San Francisco.;    At the BART
station in Fremont where an table had been set to sell tickets if the lines at
the ticket machines got too long, business was slooooooow.;    "It's slow,"
said Dennis Kozlowski, a supervisor with Bart. "Maybe the first day, they're
confused. Tomorrow if the strike lasts, more people will be here.";    They
needn't have bothered. The three people assigned to the table looked like the
Maytag repairman in the television ad -- no business.; WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO
YOU; Here are some of the expected effects of a strike by 235,000 freight-line
workers:; (box) Car and truck assembly plants could begin shutting down by
week's end. That would cause a rippling effect through component and supplier
plants, all within a week, and add up to widespread layoffs. The Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association says 70 to 80 percent of motor-vehicle manufacturing
facilities would be affected in the first 24 hours of a strike.; (box) Coal
deliveries will be disrupted. Coal is the largest single commodity carried by
the rail industry. Nationwide, railroads deliver about 57 percent of the coal
sent to domestic customers.; (box) Delays could occur in United Parcel Service
deliveries. The company uses freight trains to transport 30 percent of the 11
million packages it delivers each day.; (box) About 234,000 daily rail
commuters in the Bay Area, Southern California, Chicago and Maryland will have
to find other ways to get around.; HOW YOU CAN GET AROUND IT; CalTrain
officials urged the 11,000 people who ride its trains daily to seek other
public transit in case of a stoppage. Pass holders will be reimbursed for any
days the trains don't run. For more information on service disruption, call
(800) 558-8661.; (box) SamTrans: San Mateo County is adding buses to several
local routes and urging passengers to use its nine express routes, which leave
from Palo Alto, Redwood City, San Carlos, San Mateo and Foster City. Commuters
with monthly CalTrain passes will get a 60-cent discount. For route
information, call (800) 660-4287.; (box) Santa Clara County Transit: South Bay
buses -- specifically, Route 22, will take commuters to the Menlo Park
CalTrain station, where they can catch SamTrans's Bus 5L or 7F. But be warned
-- Bus 22 makes lots of stops, and Santa Clara County transit officials say
they aren't planning to add buses during the strike. There's no discount for
train pass holders. For route information, call (408) 287-4210.;    (box)
BART: Bay Area Rapid Transit plans to add extra trains and to set up ticket
tables at the Daly City and Fremont stations to accommodate the crush. Because
parking will be at a premium, officials are urging riders to take public
transportation to the stations or have someone drop them off. Santa Clara
County Transit Bus 180 runs from the San Jose CalTrain station to the Fremont
BART station. Call (415) 465-BART for information.; TICKET TO RIDE; Who
