   Amtrak says its recently completed test between New York and Boston of different types of train technology could lead to much faster passenger rail service. 

   The national passenger railroad says it won't decide which of the trains it favors until early next year when it finishes evaluating the test data. 
But the experiment -- using trains that take curves at much higher speeds than conventional trains -- already is raising hopes at Amtrak that travel time by rail between the two cities can be slashed by one-third, to about three hours. 

   Amtrak says the faster service would make it more competitive with air travel, luring passengers back to the railroad and relieving overburdened airports. 
The high-speed trains also could benefit other rail routes, such as those between Los Angeles and San Diego, Chicago and Detroit, and New York and Buffalo. 

   Amtrak's New York-Boston route has more than 250 curves, slowing trips to four-and-a-half hours or more, compared with an hour by air. 
The trip's duration is largely to blame for Amtrak's meager 15% share of the combined air and rail passenger market between the two cities. 

   Since last spring, Amtrak has tested turbotrains from ANF Industrie, Paris, and tilt trains from Bombardier Corp., Montreal, and Talgo-Renfe, Madrid. 

   The turbotrain's light weight, low center of gravity and a coil-spring suspension reduce its roll and sway on curves. 
In contrast, Bombardier's tilt train uses sensors in the locomotive to determine when the train is entering a curve; a hydraulic mechanism then pushes the coach body out to balance the centrifugal forces. 
On the Spanish train, the coach is hung from an overhead suspension; centrifugal forces swing the coach outward as it enters a curve, and gravity returns it to a normal position on leaving the curve. 

   Charles Engelhardt, Amtrak's senior director of equipment engineering, says he is encouraged that the test trains "rode reasonably comfortably" on curves at speeds five to 20 miles per hour above normal. 

   "Passenger trains often operate slower than safety requires," says John Riley, head of the Federal Railroad Administration. 
Instead, "the speed limits reflect the maximum speed a passenger can tolerate" on the curves, he adds. 

   David Ewing, a senior analyst at the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, which last year urged Amtrak to conduct the tests, estimates that for an expenditure of between $300 million and $400 million, Amtrak could shave an hour and a half from its current New York-Boston schedule and double ridership. 
In addition to buying new trains, the money would be used for short stretches of new track at key switching points to bypass commuter trains that share the route between New York and New Haven, Conn. 
He says that's far cheaper than expanding airport capacity or building a straighter rail line.
