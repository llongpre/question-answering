<HEAD>Sinatra's Miniature Trains Ride Through Hoboken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Frank Sinatra wants to get on track with
thoughts about his boyhood neighborhood in New Jersey, all he has to
do is hop a train _ one of 250 model trains that race through
favorite neighborhoods, including a miniature Hoboken.
   ``At Christmas when I was a kid, I'd leave Hoboken and take a
four-cent ferry ride and a five-cent train ride and head to the New
York stores. I'd stand and look at the train displays for three or
four hours until a saleslady would say, `Please don't touch _ and
would you mind moving back a bit?''' Ol' Blue Eyes says in this
weekend's edition of USA Weekend magazine.
   ``I wanted a train set so badly but I didn't know how my family
could ever afford it,'' Sinatra says. ``One day, my mother pawned
her fox fur piece to buy my first train set, a windup engine and an
oval track. I never forgot that.
   ``It was probably the only decent thing she had to wear and I was
old enough (11) to understand the sacrifice.''
   So, now, at his Rancho Mirage, Calif., home, Sinatra has an
18-foot by 30-foot train station with the 250 model traincars. Five
trains can run simultaneously on independent loops, running through
Hoboken or an Old West town and passing by a New Orleans riverboat
with a billboard announcing a sold-out Sinatra concert.
   There's one locomotive with his initials, FAS, in diamonds; a
crystal replica of the 1925 Chattanooga Choo Choo and two dozen
1895-1900 engine replicas. The magazine did not include the value of
the train.
   ``When I'm just bumming around the house with not much to do,
I'll clean the tracks, oil the engines, change the cars. The noise
of the trains running and whistling can get pretty loud, but
watching the trains just removes my head from thinking about work,''
Sinatra says.
   ``My electrician loves to get a call about a problem with the
trains. Usually, after he's found the problem, he'll say, `Why don't
we just try the whole set to make absolutely sure everything is OK?'
And I say, `Yeah, let's turn the whole room on just to be sure.'''
