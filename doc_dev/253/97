<F P=106> [Article by V. Chibisov: "Economics in the Center of </F>
Attention"] 
  [Text] The principle by which executive personnel are 
judged is their knowledge of the sector's economics, their 
ability to control them and thus ensure a stable financial state 
for their collective and sector. Such was perhaps the leitmotif 
of the sorters' conference conducted yesterday by Minister of 
Railways G. Fadeyev. The results of 5 months' work of railroad 
transportation were summarized, and the tasks to be completed in 
the first half-year were defined. 
  But before analyzing the state of affairs in the sector, the 
minister gave a briefing on the position of the Russian economy 
as a whole. Production volume continues to fall. The output of 
industrial products dropped below 55 percent. On this backdrop 
the proportion of consumption expenses is increasing, and the 
quantity of accumulated fixed capital and working capital is 
decreasing. In April almost 5,000 enterprises were partially or 
completely idle. 
  In this situation it was no accident that the RF president 
recently published edicts on the most acute problems of economic 
reform. The edicts have the greatest significance to 
transportation, because the sector's economic position depends 
on the state of the Russian economy as a whole. The strategy of 
transportation activities adopted in December at an expanded 
meeting of the board of the Ministry of Railways was adjusted in 
the direction of tighter controls, and it is now producing 
positive results. While shipments were carried out at a loss in 
the first quarter, now the situation is changing. The profit 
from shipments in April was 287 billion rubles, which made it 
possible to cover the losses for January-March, and in general 
for 4 months. A possibility for counting on profitable work 
appeared. In 5 months, income was almost R7.8 trillion, 
including 7 trillion from freight shipments. And operating 
expenses were R6.9 trillion. Profit received from shipments made 
it possible to raise profitability from 3.4 percent 
(January-April) to 12 in 5 months, and to maintain the wage 
level in accordance with the Tariff Agreement. Here is the 
situation in terms of wages: While wages grew by 16.7 percent in 
the national economy as a whole in 3 months, coming to R164,800 
in March, in railroad transportation wages increased by 29 
percent, coming to R280,000 in March (fifth place among the 
economy's leading sectors), and the figure anticipated for May 
is R323,000. 
  But this increment is tangible only when it gets into the 
hands of the workers themselves in a timely manner. This is 
where things aren't going so well. Some railroads were late in 
paying wages. I recently spoke with mechanics at the Rtishchevo 
Locomotive Depot. "We're living on credit," they said. "When you 
get your paycheck, you pay off your debts and then go back to 
living on credit. And the only wages we've gotten are those for 
March." Locomotive crews of the Kochetovka Depot complained of 
the same thing. 
  The Ministry of Railways planned to reach a normal level of 
wage payment in the first half-year. The first deadline of the 
railroads for paying off their debt to the workers was 20 May. 
Unfortunately nine railroads, to include the North Caucasus, 
Southeastern, Transbaykal and others, failed to reach the goal. 
Some of them couldn't even find financing sources, at the same 
time that their accounts payable are growing. This means that 
debts are not being collected fully from clients. 
  Economization of operating expenses continues to be a sore 
point. Eight hundred eighty-five electric locomotives and 841 
diesel locomotives are being maintained on the railroads in 
excess of the norms. Their maintenance alone has required 
expenditure of R58 billion. The condition of the locomotive 
fleet is low, especially in the South Urals, Krasnoyarsk and 
Transbaykal railroads. Unplanned locomotive repairs "swallowed 
up" 80 percent of all nonproductive expenditures in the 5 
months. Losses have been suffered in railcar management. The 
railcars of passenger trains are a third empty, but trains are 
still being formed in the same old way. There are sharp 
contrasts in the cost of a ride on commuter trains. Travel 
through one zone requires payment of R270 on the Far Eastern 
Railroad, 200 on the Kemerovo Railroad, 200 on the October 
Railroad, 160 on the Northern and South Urals railroads, 50 on 
the Moscow, Volga and Southeastern railroads, and R40 on the 
Sverdlovsk and Transbaykal railroads. In the meantime the 
expenses continue to pile up. 
  The problems of expediting freight and of tariff policy, 
progress in fulfilling the Tariff Agreement, selection of 
executive personnel, train traffic safety and other issues were 
analyzed in detail at the conference.
