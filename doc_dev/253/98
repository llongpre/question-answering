<LEADPARA>  The likely culprit in the Southern Pacific derailment that dumped 13,000
gallons of pesticide into the Sacramento River near Dunsmuir is poor
locomotive maintenance, a problem that has plagued the railroad for years.;   
Inspections of the four locomotives involved in the crash showed that faulty
electrical systems in two of them apparently produced power surges just before
the July 14 accident, it was revealed Wednesday. That has led investigators to
suspect that the locomotives suddenly lurched forward, jerking the seven cars
behind them off the track.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     One of those cars spewed a pesticide known as metam sodium into the water,
killing thousands of plants, fish and other aquatic life.;    "We haven't
concluded that this was the cause, but we've eliminated just about every other
possibility," Edward English, director of safety enforcement for the Federal
Railroad Administration, said in an interview after his testimony before a
hearing of the House government activities and transportation subcommittee.;  
 English told the subcommittee the railroad administration may take "various
enforcement actions" against Southern Pacific based on the locomotive defects.
Though he declined to be specific, regulators commonly levy administrative
penalties in such cases -- ranging from $250 to $2,500 per defect.;    But one
source close to the investigation said the federal government is probing
whether railroad personnel were aware of the electrical problems before the
97-car train started its journey. If so, the government could seek civil or
criminal penalties, the source said.;    Southern Pacific officials declined
to comment.;    English's announcement came as subcommittee staffers released
information that further intensifies the focus on Southern Pacific's
responsibility for the accident. According to federal records, the railroad
has been cited repeatedly for locomotive defects -- hundreds of times a year
in each of the last five years.;    The volume of citations indicates that
Southern Pacific has a far poorer track record on locomotive maintenance than
most other major railroads. SP was responsible for 16 percent of all
locomotive safety violations discovered by federal inspectors in 1989, though
it accounted for just 7 percent of the miles traveled by the nation's
railroads.;    And SP's locomotive problems show few signs of abating, despite
the assessment of $350,000 in fines against the company. Surprise inspections
conducted last month revealed that an estimated 83 percent of locomotives at
five different SP facilities suffered from at least one safety defect. Many of
those defects were minor -- one witness at the hearing said they range from
"too much oil on the floor of the cab to broken wheels" -- but English said
all could lead to accidents.;    Despite these problems, Southern Pacific has
not had more than its share of accidents in recent years.;    "Up to now,
they've been lucky," suggested Rep. Barbara Boxer, the San Francisco Democrat
who leads the government activities and transportation subcommittee.;    The
company has been less lucky recently: In addition to the Sacramento River
mishap, it suffered a second spectacular crash July 28 near the Southern
California town of Seacliff. English said Wednesday that investigators believe
a faulty bearing caused an axle on that train to overheat and snap but that
the investigation remains in its early stages.;    The Dunsmuir probe is
further along, and English said investigators have ruled out operator error as
a contributing cause, after reviewing information contained in a trip recorder
that is similar to the "black boxes" carried on aircraft.;    Instead, he
said, tests of the locomotives conducted in Eugene, Ore., found a faulty
electrical generator in one locomotive and a faulty "electrical module" in
another. Those problems kept the electrical system from supplying a steady
flow of current to the traction motors that turn the wheels, and apparently
allowed a surge of power in the instant before the derailment.;    English
compared the effect of that surge on the train to a sudden tug at the end of a
curved piece of string. The effect is known as "stringlining.";    Previously,
investigators have suggested that stringlining in the Dunsmuir crash may have
been caused by an improperly balanced load. They now believe that the load
pattern -- which concentrated lighter cars in the middle and heavier cars at
the end of the train -- was merely a contributing factor.;    Also on
Wednesday, Rep. Tom Campbell introduced legislation that would require
railroads to take additional care in transporting hazardous materials, and
force the federal government to lengthen the list of chemicals that receive
the most careful handling.;    Among the controversies surrounding the
Dunsmuir crash is that the Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate
metam sodium as a hazardous material, although it was revealed at the
Wednesday hearing that the U.S. Coast Guard considers the substance hazardous
because of its devastating effects in water.;    Don Clay of the Environmental
Protection Agency said he would like to see metam sodium classified as a
hazardous substance, but that the process would probably take at least two
years.  </TEXT>
