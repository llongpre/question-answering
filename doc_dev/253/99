<F P=106> [Article by S. Kasatyy, GUDOK correspondent: "Losses due to </F>
Sub-Standard Performance -- 700 Million Rubles"] 
  [Text] An important reserve for increasing the 
economic efficiency of railroad work is the elimination of 
wrecks and accidents, and reduction of cases of sub-standard 
performance in train and shunting operations. 
  Last year there were 799 cases of sub-standard performance, 
4 
wrecks and 3 accidents on the Volga Railroad. 
  Yu. Tsittel, chief of this railroad, reported at the 
technical-economic council which took place, that the losses 
from cases of sub-standard performance, accidents and wrecks in 
1993 alone constituted over 700 million rubles [R]. Losses due 
to late delivery of freight and commercial rejects were high. 
Three wrecks out of four were because of track workers: labor 
and technological discipline is low among fitters, brigade 
leaders and even foremen. 
  As the speaker noted, according to last year's results, 
because of the increase in sub-standard performance and the most 
flagrant violations of safety rules, hardly a single road 
management could be given a satisfactory evaluation. There are 
almost twice as many absentees and drunks per thousand workers 
on the Volga Railroad than on the average for Russian railroads. 
  Nearly always -- the established norms for repairing and 
operating railcars and locomotives, STsB [Signalization, 
Centralization and Blocking] and communication devices and other 
transport-technical devices are violated. 
  "Our main trouble," said B. Ladyzhenskiy, first deputy chief 
of the railroad, "is that we do not fulfill orders, but after 
all, these documents formulate and define, with maximum 
precision, the specific requirements for the workers carrying 
out their duties, the directors of the lower subdivisions, 
divisions, services and the road management. 
  "We have poor discipline and little sense of responsibility, 
though. A railcar inspector goes out to process the trains with 
a hook and an electric lantern, not having on him the necessary 
gauges or measuring instruments, and thinks that this is normal. 
By no means every road foreman knows how to use a track gauge 
correctly. 
  "On two occasions recently I headed a road commission 
checking the safety conditions on the Yershov Division," Boris 
Timofeyevich went on, "Well? The Krasnyy Kut junction was a 
disaster, because they work on the `take a chance' system there. 
The inspectors pay calls there, but what use are these journeys: 
they jot down various notes, as a matter of form, but take no 
measures against safety violators. At the Pugachevsk Depot, 
again on the Yershov Division, locomotives issued for passenger 
trains are not inspected by a command staff, as the rules 
require.... 
  "The incompetence of those who are involved in train and 
shunting operations has taken on a simply mass, threatening 
nature. This example was given: at one depot, because of the 
ignorance of the crew, it was not the electric traction motor of 
a locomotive, which had got out of order, that was disconnected, 
but -- the motor of one in good working order. In another case, 
the engineer sent his assistant to shut off the distributor 
valve on a rail car, but the assistant went and shut off the 
brake end cocks and nearly deprived the train of the required 
brake pressure. It was a good thing that the engineer noticed in 
time and corrected the error, or they would have gone out onto 
the section without any brakes." 
  These and numerous other examples of dense technical 
incompetence attest to the fact that locomotive workers, railcar 
workers, track workers, transport workers and other workers 
involved in ensuring traffic safety have been very badly trained 
everywhere. The ignorance and lack of skill of rank-and-file 
people carrying out their duties very often leads to 
sub-standard work and damage to locomotives en route. 
  The poor organization of training and raising qualifications 
attests to the fact it is not those who just recently sat, let 
us say, at a locomotive control panel, and not the novice 
transport workers who violate the safety rules, but the 
experienced workers. A first-class engineer drives a train with 
false information about the brakes. 
  This means that training should be continuous, in order to 
raise the vocational level of the workers. 
  As I. Tsinkerman, chief of the Signals, Communications and 
Computer Technology Department, justifiably noted, the 
competency of many commanders of various ranks is such that they 
themselves must be taught the ABC's of the railroad business. 
What kind of teachers are they, then, for their subordinates? 
  V. Nikitin, deputy chief of the railroad for Personnel and 
Social Problems, expressed anxiety about the fact that the 
number of engineers and technicians at the sites is being 
sharply reduced. At the Astrakhan Division, one can literally 
count on one's fingers the number of working railroad men who 
are taking correspondence courses at transport VUZes [higher 
educational institutions] and technical schools. Many positions 
are held by practical workers whose technical knowledge is very 
limited. It is clear that these people are not capable of 
conducting technical training or directing production at today's 
level. V. Nikitin noted that on the Pallasovka track 
subdivision, they feel sorry for their drunken workers, and do 
not fire them, but make drunkards of them and others. What kind 
of safety can be ensured there from a track worker who is "under 
the weather"? 
  Safety and finances are inseparable -- this was the essence 
of the speech made by A. Korolkov, chief of the Financial 
Department. Freight loading and shipment is now reduced by over 
30 percent. This is where the large deficit in the road budget 
comes from. Losses here due to sub-standard work, accidents and 
wrecks constitute hundreds of millions of rubles. 
  Unfortunately, at the technical council, especially 
dedicated 
to safety, not a word was said about whether losses from 
slip-shod workers are recovered. Later on I met with inspectors 
and financiers, in order to get an answer to this question. It 
turns out that damages can and must be recovered from those who 
damaged rails, locomotives or railcars, in the railroad's favor, 
in an amount not exceeding the monthly wage of the guilty person. 
  "Was much recovered from slip-shod workers during 1993?" I 
expressed my interest to A. Korolkov, chief of the Financial 
Department. 
  "So far, not all the amounts, since the materials on recent 
accidents and cases of sub-standard work, and institution of 
criminal proceedings against the guilty parties are at the stage 
of investigation in the people's courts. Even if they decide 
that the losses are to be recovered, quite a while will pass 
before the money begins to come in.... And the prices for the 
things will be different." 
  Nothing was said, either, about the public-spirited people, 
or about the role of the assistant directors of the enterprises, 
specially introduced to deal with safety. No evaluation was 
given of the work of the inspector members of the staff for the 
mainline and divisions. It is annoying that these topics, 
important for safety, were omitted.
