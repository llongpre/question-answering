   A judge Tuesday ordered Penthouse magazine and
its publisher Robert Guccione to pay $4.06 million to a former Pet
of the Year who charged that he used her as a virtual sex slave.
   State Judge Elliott Wilk ruled that Guccione made sexual demands
on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition of employment at Penthouse,
where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Wilk
said.
   Guccione's ``cold and calculating ... use of sexual coercion
forced her to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,''
which is a violation of state law, Wilk said.
   Thoreson, now 37, sued Guccione for $10 million, alleging breach
of contract, sexual harassment and fraud.
   She testified during the March 1989 trial that Guccione forced
her to perform hard-core sex acts in a pornographic movie and used
her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a hotel-casino he
owned in Atlantic City.
   She said Guccione also ordered her to carry on a sex affair with
his financial adviser so he would move from England to the United
States. She said she severed the relationship because it appeared
the adviser was going to leave his wife and four children.
   Her attorney, Murray Schwartz, said the ruling is ``for all the
women like her who may have suffered at the hands of Guccione. He
has finally been held accountable.''
   Penthouse lawyer Jeffrey Daichman labeled Thoreson a liar and
said an appeal was expected. The ruling ``read more like a
political manifesto about the women's movement than an objective
analysis of the evidence,'' he said.
   Guccione said in a statement that Penthouse presented evidence
to the judge showing that Thoreson ``was a former prostitute,
drug-abuser and three-time felon who had violated her probation.''
   He said Thoresen allegedly began an affair with the financial
adviser ``at a time when she was not even employed by Penthouse.''
   At the trial, Guccione testified that Thoreson was a potential
Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime.
   The judge, who heard the case with no jury, said Guccione's only
evidence to contradict Thoreson was his word, and added, ``I do not
believe him.''
   Wilk awarded Thoreson $4 million in punitive damages and $60,000
in compensatory damages. The amounts were based on Guccione's $150
million personal worth and Penthouse's market value of about $200
million, he said.
   Thoreson, a native of St. Paul, Minn., was working as a topless
dancer and a cocktail waitress in California in 1973 when she sent
Guccione nude photos and asked if he could help her become an
actress.
   Guccione began by signing her to a personal management contract
and changing her name to Anika di Lorenzo. He made her Penthouse
Pet of the Year in 1975 and invited her to move into his New York
townhouse, which she did.
   In 1976, Guccione cast her in his sexually explicit movie
``Caligula,'' which Thoreson now says was a pornographic film that
ruined her career. For her role, Guccione paid for surgery to have
her breasts enlarged.
   Guccione testified during the trial that he cast her in Caligula
because she was sexually ``and perfect for the part.''
   ``I thought it was a leg-up on prostitution in Las Vegas,
stealing cars, writing bum checks, and building up a life of
crime,'' he said, referring to her checkered past.
   Thoreson sued Guccione after he fired her in 1980 because she
refused to accompany him on a trip to the Far East. She said she
feared he would pass her around to the businessmen he was meeting.
