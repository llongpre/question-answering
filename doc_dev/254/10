Given the tendency for the slightest change on BBC Radio to prompt howls of
outrage, the quiet revolution that has transformed Going Places (Radio 4,
Friday) into a pendant of Breakaway has passed comparatively bloodlessly.
Perhaps others felt as I did that the old format, with its emphasis on
adenoidal hearties of both sexes devoted to four wheels, reeked of
rusticised suburbia and saloon-bar squire-speak. They never seemed
interested in places, merely the mechanics of getting there.
The programme is now an idiosyncratic travel piece, not a holiday mag like
Breakaway but a smaller-scale exploration of the off-beat - Scotland's
secret nuclear bunker, for instance, recently opened as a tourist attraction
near Anstruther in Fife. Though it was equipped with a broadcasting studio,
the locals had no idea it was there. Chillingly, if disaster struck no
family, relatives or friends surplus to personnel were to be admitted. As
somebody remarked, many of the elite would have preferred to stay outside.
The same programme took composer Gavin Bryars to Whitby with its ruined
abbey, kipper-houses and Dracula connection. And memories of a west-country
childhood stirred within me at the news that a recalcitrant RSPCA official
had hijacked the bell-ringing swan of Wells, releasing it where there are no
bell-pulls to tug at teatime and where it presumably has to find its own
food. The swan-keeper was strangely dry-eyed. 'My wife was more affected
than I was,' he confessed, adding that she was 'a cantankerous old thing but
wonderful.' (I assume he meant the swan.)
The Madness of Kings (Radio 4) was disappointingly lightweight. It was
introduced by Christopher Cooke whose exquisite sensibilities, he once
confided to The Heritage Quiz, are jarred by such oafishness as the Last
Night of the Proms and Gilbert and Sullivan (notably, I imagine, at the Lord
High Executioner's strictures against 'the idiot who praises with
enthusiastic tone/All centuries but this and every country but his own').
The mini-series on the addling of crowned heads was inconclusive. Caligula
perhaps had encephalitis, Hitler Parkinson's. Nero was not so bad, possibly
schizophrenic. The Plantagenets had terrible tempers. Ludwig of Bavaria
probably didn't do anything with his young men, though his scheme to rob the
Rothschild bank in Frankfurt seems a trifle extreme even by today's free and
easy royal standards. The programme acknowledged the danger of describing
any boo-worthy behaviour by the all-purpose 'mad'; and then proceeded to do
so. Its brief necessarily ignored the hysterical repression that led to
middle and lower-class 'madness', breakdowns and suicide in Victorian times.
There are records of the mass demise in Bristol of an entire below-stairs
staff on the death of their mistress. Those were the days.
The nostalgia factor still operates in favour of middle-aged DJs. On Radio
John Peel drones on after a quarter-century, his vocal dreariness the aural
equivalent of fallen arches. The self-consciously quirky choice of music
recalls the modishness that had John Mortimer, no less, singing his praises.
But then the distinguished QC once referred to Boy George's 'sweet Irish
tenor'. He should be on the new matey Radio 3, along with John Peel,
Caligula and bell-ringing swans. They will be, reader, they will be.
