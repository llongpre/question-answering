THE NEW Paris theatre season has had an early, surprise star in Mortadela,
which suggests a slice of charcuterie but is about death, desire,
fleshiness. It is the most irresistibly sexy show in town, a home-spun
musical of one man's memories whose character and warmth not only thrill the
soul but throw into relief the refined heartlessness of Paris national
theatre. Mortadela, at La Cigale in Montmartre, and another powerful music
drama, Zarzuela, nearby at the Bouffes du Nord, suggests that the pulse of
Paris theatre is beating not in the premiere arrondissement but in the
raffish outer districts.
At La Cigale, an old cafe chantant or musical, Alfredo Arias' review of his
Argentinian youth celebrates the tango in its heyday and is a bittersweet
evocation of the women from his past. Some dance their way into his memory
by erotic display, like Cecilia Rosetto in 'Banana' who seduces astonished
men in the audience with peeled bananas plucked from her thighs or
head-dress; the male emcee responds with drag pastiche in bikini and
tropical fruit. Others move to the rhythm of sexual domination and
submission; one woman beats a rope on the floor as she dances to the pace of
a low-toned conga drum while another just out of reach writhes in coils of
fear and invitation.
Whirlwind tangos, jaunty cha-chas, offset sadder boleros and chansons while
an accordion wails notes of sorrow and displacement. Never far off is the
dance of death: trompe l'oeil exchange of a doll for acrobatic dwarf actress
Pilar Rebollar, apparently dashed to the ground in a family row; a butcher,
murdering his unfaithful wife with a meat knife, elaborates the macabre
title.
Most of Arias' numbers, as well as his performers, come from the music halls
of Buenos Aires and they sing and dance with a passion and romance of exiles
recreating a lost world: throaty, tender, lustful, desperate. The show's
life-is-a-cabaret mood is raw yet slick - in songs, satiric monologues,
legwork, the pattern of pumps and stilettos on the ground. Few musicals
exhilarate with the kitsch glitz of purple roses and torso-hugging velvet
while wearing a vulnerable heart so openly on their sleeves.
The French term for play or performance, spectacle, hints at the spirit not
only of French music hall and its Montmartre traditions but also of straight
French drama, which is far more likely to include song and dance routines
than its English or German counterparts. Caligula, which opened at the
Comedie Francaise earlier this year, is a brilliant example of dance
illuminating themes in a complex work through sensual power and provocative
display. But too often a play degenerates into a mindless spectacle of
formal kicks and tuneless squeaks, which is the catastrophe of the Comedie
Francaise's newest production, Lermontov's Bal Masque.
Like Mortadela, this is a dance of death, but the contrast could not be
greater. Lermontov's tale of revenge via Russian aristocratic traditions -
gambling, masked balls, wife-poisoning, duels (Lermontov, aged 27, was
killed in one) - is enacted by puppet figures in black and white, masked,
some encased in porcelain heads like 19th century dolls, who progress by
candlelight to their doom. Solemn music recalls a funeral march; passionless
dialogue is spat out in the kind of sharp glacial French, only heard on this
stage, which could cut crystal. Director Anatoli Vassiliev has achieved a
sculptural beauty which awes for perhaps 10 minutes; he leaves his ghostly
tableau on stage for three-and-a-half slow motion hours. There is no
interval.
Here is the Comedie Francaise at its most degenerate. For decades it has
lived on inflated reputation and mystique bolstered by the French press. The
classical virtues it cultivated have been pushed to such extremes that they
have turned decadent. Productions are lumbering, absolutely unemotional.
Actors move with an authoritarian chic which is stuffy and posey, and speak
in a cut glass monotone which renders all reactions the same. In particular
productions by Vassiliev, the Comedie Francaise's celebrated director
Antoine Vitez, and actor-director Jean-Luc Boutte, who here plays the
vengeful hero Arbenine as a deadly robot, are marked by a cold intelligence
which assures unity of tone, set, costumes but innoculates against force,
tenderness, passion. Unless original shows of the calibre of Chahine's
Caligula - disliked by critics, but playing to packed houses - continue to
join the repertory, the Comedie Francaise risks decline into self parody.
Across the river, Paris's second serious national theatre, the Theatre
L'Europe, could attract the brightest and best of European directors but has
wasted the last year in an almost exclusive 'cycle hispanique' of obscure
plays in Spanish and Catalan made intelligible to French audiences by
surtitles. Its home productions have been mixed - most successful was
Patrice Chereau doing Botho Strauss; most dismal Peter Zadek's Measure for
Measure spoken by a cast which barely seems to understand its lines. And for
all the Spanish enthusiasm, the most exciting French/Spanish work now
touring Europe is Alain Maratrat's feisty, moving spectacle Zarzuela, which
I reviewed at its Vienna premiere, and which has come to Peter Brook's
cavernous Bouffes du Nord theatre.
Highlights to come in the Autumn Arts Festival emphasise the growing
importance and daring of the suburban theatres which form a classy outer
ring round Paris, and it is here, and in venues like the unfashionable
Cigale that the future of Paris theatre looks most promising.
