   Video mania is gripping Eastern Europe,
brought on by a booming black market in VCRs and a desire of
millions to see movies banned in state-controlled theaters.
   Clearly worried, the communist governments are going on the
attack against them, but at the same time they are trying to corner
some of the lucrative market.
   In Poland, some Roman Catholic parishes organize video showings
of religious and dissident films, and they draw large audiences.
   Any Hungarian can get a fill of gut-wrenching violence, group
sex, anti-Soviet sentiment and other East bloc taboos.
   A newspaper in Romania shocked readers recently with the account
of a rapist who lured a victim to his home by offering to show her
Sylvester Stallone in ``Rambo.''
   ``Video is a powerful weapon,'' the Czechoslovak Communist Party
daily Rude Pravo said recently.
   ``Video must no longer pass unnoticed,'' complained the Polish
weekly Politika. ``Its scale has become far too big. The video
market has managed to escape any control by the state and perhaps
this is the reason why it is flourishing.''
   According to semiofficial estimates, at least 2 million video
recorders have made their way into the six Soviet bloc countries,
which have a total population of about 110 million.
   The scarcity of video recorders and the lure of the independent
entertainment they offer means millions of East Europeans are
hunting for VCRS.
   East Europeans who travel to the West often buy VCRs for
themselves or to sell on the black market back home where they
fetch many times their Western price.
   In Romania and Bulgaria, for example, an inexpensive Western VCR
can cost the equivalent on the black market of $4,500 _ 15 times
the average monthly salary.
   In East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, VCRs are
available in special hard-currency stores, with prices ranging from
$400 in Poland to $1,200 in East Germany.
   ``It's a lot of money, but it's the best entertainment we've got
and a kind of escape from the daily fare of state-owned culture,''
said a doctor in Romania, where the state television is on the air
just two hours a day on weekdays.
   Like other East Europeans with friends or relatives in the West,
the doctor paid a hefty customs duty _ $700 _ to get a Japanese VCR
sent by his sister in West Germany.
   The demand matches the high prices.
   In Bucharest, the classified-ad pages of the government
newspaper Romania Libera are devoted almost exclusively to offers
to buy or sell videos.
   In Poland, public video showings have moved from X-rated films
like ``Emmanuelle,'' ''Caligula'' and ``120 Days of Sodom'' to
regular shows in cultural centers in housing projects or villages
that have no movie theaters.
   The Polish underground publishing house Nowa has released at
least 12 video cassettes, including the American movies ``Moscow on
the Hudson'' and ``Sophie's Choice.''
   It also has distributed banned Polish films, such as Ryszard
Bugajski's ``Przesluchania'' (The Interrogation), which is about a
woman imprisoned in the Stalinist era.
   Some Catholic parishes in Poland have VCRs, which they use for
public showings of religious and other films. A church in Bialystok
had an Easter showing of ``Yentl,'' the Barbra Streisand movie
about Jews in Poland.
   The Polish underground publication Video Narcomania estimated
last year that more than 70 percent of video cassettes in Poland
are pure escapism: pornography, science fiction, horror movies,
other thrillers and comedies.
   That pattern holds across the bloc, where the most popular
movies are Western box-office hits like ``Top Gun'' or ``Platoon.''
Recordings of American television series like ``Dallas'' and
``Dynasty'' are also well-liked, as is soft porn and anti-communist
films such as ``Rambo II'' and ``Rocky IV.''
   Apparently trying to channel popular interest toward ``less
noxious'' themes, Czechoslovakia's Rude Pravo assailed the popular
taste in videos.
   ``Video programs on the black market are creations exploiting
the lowest instincts of sexuality and inhuman violence,'' it said.
``VCR owners admire low quality movies full of blood until late at
night in copies that are hard to watch.''
   Throughout the bloc, people can watch up to four badly copied
movies a night at private video parties.
   In Romania, a Western, a porno movie and a cup of coffee costs
$16, almost 20 times more than a ticket to a state movie theater.
   Official efforts seem unlikely to stop the video craze anytime
soon, and communist governments have taken some steps to get in on
the profits.
   In Czechoslovakia, a joint venture has been established using
components and know-how from the Dutch company Philips to produce
100,000 VCRs a year.
   Throughout Eastern Europe, authorities have produced
ideologically acceptable movies for the VCR, set up rental services
and levied steep fees on imported material.
   Repression is also used. More than 100 semiofficial rental shops
in Poland are now being liquidated under a 1987 law tightening
control on the video market.
   In Lodz, some private Polish video-library owners face trial on
charges of piracy, and one case has been reported of a VCR owner
having his machine confiscated for screening porno.
