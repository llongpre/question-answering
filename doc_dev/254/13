<TEXT>  FROM: National Affairs Desk; TO: Jann S. Wenner; DATE: April 15, 1991;
SUBJECT: Nancy Reagan/Kitty Kelley Book Review; COMMENTS: Cancel; THERE ARE
some things, Jann, that we know in our hearts are Ugly, and this book is one
of them. It is old swill in a new bottle, a squalid tale from a squalid time
that unfortunately seems to be ours. There is something weird about any
calendar that has the Year of the Weasel happening 13 times in a row.;   
Anyway, thanks for the review copy of Kelley's book on Nancy. It was good for
a few laughs, but not many. And there is meaning in it, for sure, but not
much. It is an ugly, mean little package that made me feel cheap for just
reading it or even holding the thing in my hands.;    This book is a monument
to everything low and mean in the human spirit. It is a marketing triumph for
that dingbat from Simon and Schuster, but it is far too wrong and repugnant to
keep around the house, and last night I had to get rid of it. My friend Semmes
Luckett took it away and jammed it into a garbage compactor, along with a case
of old beer bottles. He was shocked and deeply embarrassed when he opened the
book to page 14 and saw that both he and Nancy are descended from the same
family of Lucketts that left Maryland and fled westward around the turn of the
century, when the family name came under a cloud of scandal. "My mama never
talked about it," he said, "but she left the room whenever that woman appeared
on our TV set. . . . Good Lord, I hope she never sees this book." He seized it
off the table and stood up to leave.;    The master politician;  Let's give
Nancy all the credit she deserves. The Democrats have lost five out of the
last six presidential elections, so maybe they can learn something from this
book instead of just giggling about it. Kitty Dukakis, among others, might
have put this evil handbook to good use if it had been available back in 1988.
But alas . . .;    If politics is the art of controlling your environment,
Nancy is a master politician and probably a lot more fun to live and work and
travel with than I ever suspected. She has been the Best That She Can Be, and
she has come a Very Long Way for a Size 2 Anorexic Dwarf.;    All that time
she was talking about remodeling the White House in the style of Dolley
Madison, she was acting like Linda Lovelace and Christine Keeler and Madame
Defarge all at once.;    Weirder than Caligula;  They turned the whole East
Wing of the White House into a Cave of Orgies and a dope den worse than
anything in Singapore. It was horrible. The press called him John Wayne, but
he was weirder than Caligula, and the weirder he got the more the voters loved
him and the more respect he got from Ted Koppel.;    Lyndon LaRouche was
atomized and the Deviate Rev. Jim Bakker was sent to prison for 45 years for
just dabbling in the kind of brazen, low-rent crimes that were apparently
taken for granted and pursued with relentless zeal -- day and night, 366 days
of the year, in full view of the servants and the Secret Service -- by the
folks who lived in the White House.;    Just folks. No different from you or
me or the Mitchell Brothers. And they never claimed to be anything else,
really. Just Good Ol' Dutch and What's Her Name, the maniac little sex doll
who squawked openly (allegedly) with Frank Sinatra on dim-lit couches in TV
studios, where she went constantly to tape public-service announcements about
Just Say No.;    It was a very wild act in a very fast lane, and I have to
admire it for its Heaviness. It is no small thing in some circles to make
headlines lewd and and shocking enough to bump a new KENNEDY/PALM BEACH RAPE
case off the front page of the tabloids. . . . That is Strong. . . . That is
Charles Manson country.;    Remember they laughed at Thomas Edison. And don't
forget that "Deep Throat" was a box-office hit in the same years that Nancy
spent grooming her mongrel stud for the Real Derby, the biggest race of them
all . . . and They Won!!! Twice!!!;    So never mind that review we were
talking about. The book is old gossip and sleazy little stories that we read a
long time ago and never quite believed . . . for good or ill.;    So what if
the former First Lady had the soul of a Pod and the style of a chicken in
heat? She was, in her time, perhaps the highest and finest expression of the
American dream in action . . . and that is worth noting. Some people are born
to win and others are spewed out like tadpoles. This is all ye know and all ye
need to know -- except that weasels speak English and God is a King Snake, and
if Kitty Kelley and Nancy Reagan are what America is all about these days,
there is light at the end of the tunnel.;    But not here. I am glad to be rid
of this book. It is like a bracing dose of ether on Monday Night in a Crack
House. The very sight of it fills me with queasiness and shame. To read it and
believe that it might be true is to wallow in the depths of personal and
professional degradation.;    OK. That's about it for now. Never send me a
book like this again.;    Thanks,;    Hunter;    Res Ipsa Loquitur (box)  </TEXT>
