<HEAD>Pioneer Press Ends Afternoon Edition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saint Paul Pioneer Press will end
afternoon publication Nov. 9. The move is expected to eliminate
about 30 jobs.
   Mary Junck, publisher and president, said circulation of the
evening paper had dropped to 29,000 from a high of 121,000 in 1972.
Morning circulation of the paper has soared, she said.
   ``Like newspaper readers in other parts of the country, most of
ours want their newspaper in the morning,'' Junck said Oct. 23.
   A poor economic outlook for 1991 also led to the decision.
   ``The conversion to AM enables the Pioneer Press to focus all
its resources on the morning and Sunday editions. We're positioned
very well to be even more competitive and increase our circulation
at an even faster pace,'' Junck said.
   The Twin Cities' other evening newspaper, the Minneapolis Star,
was discontinued in 1982.
   Newsroom reductions will be through attrition and a voluntary
early retirement program, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Boehm Says He Made a Mistake by Staking Out Newspaper Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Tax Commissioner John Boehm said he
erred in staking out a newspaper building to see who among his
employees had gone there to complain that he was stifling their
free speech at work.
   ``In retrospect, I made a mistake,'' Boehm said Oct. 25. ``It
was an error in judgment.''
   Earlier this month, a dozen Department of Revenue employees went
to the Journal-Star Printing Co. building to talk to a reporter.
Boehm acknowledged that he and his deputy commissioner drove around
the building, which houses the Lincoln Journal, The Lincoln Star
and Lincoln office of The Associated Press.
   A day later, Boehm distributed a memo to department
administrators. It dealt with whether employees could be
disciplined for insubordinate remarks during staff meetings about
the governor, a department head or other supervisors.
   Three of the employees who went to the newspaper building said
Oct. 25 that they felt department employees put their careers in
jeopardy if they disagreed with Boehm or criticized the
administration of Gov. Kay Orr.
   They said Boehm's surveillance increased their worries.
   ``Their fears are unfounded,'' Boehm said. ``I went there
because I had been told that maybe 40 or 50 department people were
going to be there and I was curious. I wasn't taking names.''
   Boehm said none of the employees who talked to reporters would
be subject to disciplinary action for speaking out.

<HEAD>Paper Carrier Allegedly Burglarized Out-of-Town Customers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper carrier has been accused of
burglarizing the homes of subscribers after they notified him to
suspend delivery while they were out of town.
   Dwayne L. Young, 32, who delivered the Austin American-Statesman
in an area west of the University of Texas campus, was charged with
burglary of a habitation, burglary of a motor vehicle and criminal
mischief.
   Police said he is suspected in about 30 residential break-ins
and 20 burglaries of vehicles, the newspaper reported Sept. 26.
   Police have recovered about $11,600 worth of stolen property
from the burglaries, which date to last December.
   Young was not an employee of the newspaper but was one of about
650 independent contractors who deliver the American-Statesman, the
paper said. He has delivered newspapers since August 1989.

<HEAD>Photographer Wants $10,000 From Governor's Campaign for Use of
Photo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A photographer said he billed Gov. Tommy
Thompson's campaign $10,000 for using a copyrighted postcard photo
in a television advertisement without permission.
   Michael Kienitz, a freelancer and former University of Wisconsin
News Service photographer, said Oct. 25 that he also intended to
seek an injunction in federal court if the campaign did not stop
the advertisements.
   Kienitz said the Thompson advertisement shows his photograph of
the State Capitol taken at night during a 1980 campaign appearance
by then Democratic presidential hopeful Jerry Brown of California.
The photograph was copyrighted in 1982 and reproduced as a
postcard, Kienitz said.
   Scott Jensen, Thompson's campaign manager, said he was unaware
of Kienitz's claims and the bill.

<HEAD>Defense in Reporter-Slaying Trial Says Jury Pool Too White</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Joseph Lomax, who is charged
in the slaying of newspaper reporter Kara Laczynski three years
ago, urged a Superior Court judge to make sure blacks and
minorities are well represented on the jury in Lomax's third trial.
   Race has evolved into a central issue in the case. Lomax is
black and Laczynski was white.
   During Lomax's second trial, defense lawyer Joseph Moniz
compared the Laczynski slaying to the well-known Stuart case in
Boston, where police were criticized for seeking a black suspect in
the killing of a white woman. Numerous blacks were questioned in
that case and one black man became a suspect before the woman's
husband was implicated.
   Supporters of Lomax characterize him as a black victim of white
justice.
   In a motion filed in Hartford Superior Court on Oct. 22, Moniz
urged Judge Maxwell Heiman ``to take appropriate steps to assure a
sufficient number of blacks and minorities to reflect a fair
cross-section of the community.''
   The names of potential jurors are culled only from voter
registration lists and Motor Vehicles Department records, Moniz
wrote.
   The jury pool thus fails to include city residents who don't
need or can't afford a car and who have been ``alienated from
participation in the political process,'' Moniz said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Guccione, Penthouse To Pay Former Model $4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Guccione and Penthouse magazine have been
ordered to pay more than $4 million to a former Pet of the Year who
said she was forced to perform hard-core sex acts and sleep with
two Guccione associates.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Supreme
Court Justice Elliott Wilk said in finding that the magazine
publisher made sexual demands on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition
of employment at Penthouse, where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   His ``cold and calculating . . . use of sexual coercion forced
her to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,'' the
judge said Oct. 23.
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, called the award an
outrage and said he would appeal.
