<HEAD>Congressmen Protest Banishment Of African Opposition Leader</HEAD>

   Fifty-eight members of Congress have joined in
a protest to Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko over his banishment
of a prominent opposition leader to internal exile.
   A letter circulated by Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., urged
Mobutu to rescind his banishment of Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, who was
sent last month to a remote town in northeastern Zaire.
   ``This internal exile is a clear violation of internationally
recognized civil and political rights,'' the letter said. It was
dated May 3 and made available Friday by the Rainbow Lobby, which
has been pushing to reverse the U.S. policy of support for Mobutu.
   Tshisekedi, a former interior minister who now leads the
opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress, was seized
April 8 after writing a letter calling Mobutu the ``Zairian
Caligula,'' a reference to the Roman despot.
   The letter criticized Mobutu for failing to implement promises
of greater democracy.
