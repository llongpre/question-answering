INSIDE THE FOREIGN OFFICE by John Dickie Chapmans Pounds 20, 338 pages
MORE THAN any department of state, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has
succeeded in shrouding itself in an aura of mystique and elitism which has
elicited both the admiration and irritation of the public and Parliament. In
the words of the latest work attempting to break down its hallowed portals:
'Those on the inside are bound by a code of confidentiality which inhibits
the disclosure of affairs of state in any detail that might be damaging to
the best interests of the country. Those on the outside . . . are not
normally trusted to have access to anything or anyone in the Foreign Office
which could result in the outside world getting to know what is really going
on inside.'
Things are not quite as bad as they are sometimes painted, however. Foreign
Office mandarins, though often imbued with a sense of their own superiority
 -just like those of the Treasury or the grands corps in France - have
proved to be more accessible during the last decade or two. Nowadays, some
are even prepared to talk to journalists they know well, ('off the record,'
of course), though the knowledge imparted in these conversations is only
rarely of the kind to produce banner headlines.
John Dickie, the immensely experienced, if sometimes endearingly irascible,
Diplomatic Correspondent of the Daily Mail from 1960 until his retirement
last year, has been more successful than most of his fellow mortals in
penetrating the veils of secrecy which envelop Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's
impressive Victorian palace in King Charles Street. One of the last of the
dying breed of Fleet Street prima donnas, Dickie, habitually sporting a
carnation even in the desert, can claim to have covered most of the major
international events and conferences of the last 30 years. He has liberally
drawn on his long experience, complemented by as many as 150 interviews with
senior diplomats, international civil servants and politicians, in his book,
Inside the Foreign Office.
This is a painstaking and thoroughly researched study of both the way the FO
works, the personalities and policies of the Foreign Secretaries who have
led it, from Lord Home to Mr Douglas Hurd, and some of the most dramatic
events in which they and their officials were the leading actors, the work
highlights both the department's strengths and weaknesses.
In particular, Dickie tempers his admiration for the intellectual brilliance
of some of the most outstanding mandarins of the period covered - Sir
Nicholas Fenn, Sir Michael Palliser, Sir David Hannay, Sir John Kerr, to
name but a few of those earning a place in the author's hall of fame - with
telling statistics underlining the restrictive nature of the FO's
recruitment system. In spite of recent efforts to broaden the selection
process, the great majority of candidates recommended for appointments in
the Diplomatic Service - about 70 per cent over the last few years - still
come from Oxford or Cambridge, while women continue to obtain no more than
30 per cent of the places , at the very most. Without professing to be a
political history of the 30-year period during which the author had a
grandstand view of the conduct of British foreign policy, the book affords
some illuminating insights into what happened behind the scenes of major
events. The patience and dedication shown by Lord Carrington and his
officials, including the present Ambassador to the US, Sir Robin Renwick, in
negotiating against tremendous odds the Lancaster House agreement leading to
the independence of Zimbabwe, is analysed in some detail, as is the same
Foreign Secretary's failure to read the writing on the wall before the
Argentine invasion of the Falklands.
As one would expect from a journalist, amusing anecdotes are not lacking
about 'the helmsmen' at the Foreign Office, but he never descends into
caricature. Thus Lord Home, whose nomination as Foreign Secretary in 1960 by
Harold Macmillan was described by the Daily Mirror as 'the most reckless
political appointment since the Roman Emperor Caligula made his favourite
horse a consul,' is shown to be a particularly tough and effective
negotiator with the Russians, as demonstrated by his expulsion of 105
suspected Soviet agents. Neither is George Brown's often intemperate
behaviour allowed to distort the picture of a Foreign Secretary
wholeheartedly dedicated to getting Britain into the European Community.
The much-publicised conflicts between the Foreign Office and 10 Downing
Street during Margaret Thatcher's last years of office are put in their
proper historical perspective. The author stresses that this phenomenon is
nothing new. Churchill dominated Eden at the Foreign Office, while he, in
turn, did the same to Selwyn Lloyd. Wilson did not hesitate to take over
foreign policy in spite of the resentment of his Foreign Secretaries Michael
Stewart and George Brown. But at the end of the day, even Mrs Thatcher
surrounded herself with Foreign Office mandarins as her close advisers,
including, notably, her all-powerful private secretary, Charles Powell. She
may not have liked the institution, but she certainly respected and liked
its top of the range products.
