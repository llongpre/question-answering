   Bob Guccione and Penthouse magazine have been
ordered to pay more than $4 million to a former Pet of the Year who
said she was forced to perform hard-core sex acts and sleep with
two Guccione associates.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Supreme
Court Justice Elliott Wilk said in finding that the magazine
publisher made sexual demands on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition
of employment at Penthouse, where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   His ``cold and calculating ... use of sexual coercion forced her
to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,'' the judge
said Tuesday.
   Thoreson, 37, testified during the 1989 trial that Guccione
forced her to perform hard-core sex acts in a pornographic movie
and used her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a
hotel-casino he owned in Atlantic City.
   She said Guccione also ordered her to carry on an affair with
his financial adviser so he would move from England to the United
States. She said she severed the relationship because it appeared
the adviser was going to leave his wife and children.
   Thoreson's lawyer, Murray Schwartz, said she cried when he
called her in California with the news.
   This decision is ``for all the women like her who may have
suffered at the hands of Guccione,'' Schwartz said. ``He has
finally been held accountable.''
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, called the award an
outrage and said he will appeal.
   He said that Thoreson had a relationship with Guccione before
she was employed by Penthouse. But ``during the time of her
employment, there was no sexual relationship between her and
anybody associated with Penthouse.''
   At the trial, Guccione testified that Thoreson was a potential
Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime.
   Guccione's only evidence to contradict Thoreson was his word,
Wilk noted. The judge, who heard the case with no jury, added, ``I
do not believe him.''
   Wilk awarded Thoreson $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4
million in punitive damages. The judge said the amounts were based
on Guccione's $150 million personal worth and Penthouse's market
value of about $200 million.
   Thoreson, originally from St. Paul, Minn., approached Guccione
in 1973 at age 20. She sent him nude photos of herself and a
letter.
   At the time, she was living in California, where she was working
as a cocktail waitress and topless dancer, did some modeling and
took acting lessons. She also had several minor brushes with the
law, the judge said.
   Guccione said in a statement Tuesday that Penthouse presented
evidence that Thoreson was a former prostitute, drug abuser and
``three-time felon who had violated her probation.''
   Thoreson said she told Guccione she wanted to be an actress. He
signed her to a personal management contract, changed her name to
Anika di Lorenzo, made her Penthouse Pet of the Year in 1975 and
took her into his New York townhouse.
   In 1976, Guccione cast Thoreson in ``Caligula,'' a movie based
loosely on the life of the mad Roman emperor. The film features
bloody tortures, nudity and hard-core sex.
   At Guccione's urging, Thoreson said, she had her breasts
enlarged for the role. In the movie, shown at the trial, Thoreson
engages in sex acts with a man and a woman.
   Thoreson sued Guccione for fraud and sexual harassment after he
fired her in 1980 because she refused to accompany him on a trip to
the Far East. She said she feared he would pass her around to the
businessmen he was meeting.
