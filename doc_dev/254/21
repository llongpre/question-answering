'Thyestes'

Attack me with whips and snakes. The zodiac's falling. My hair's standing on
end with horror. The stars have all run away.
No, these melodramatic flights come not from some Elizabethan, Jacobean or
Romantic melodrama, but from the Roman playwright Seneca. And they come from
him by way of, of all people, Caryl Churchill, whose translation of his
Thyestes has just arrived at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs after its
debut last week in Manchester.
Seneca's plays are an odd mix: overblown rhetoric, lurid descriptions of
gore, and - so surprising - some remarkably acute psychological strokes. The
average Senecan speech builds one massive blockbuster effect on another,
piling Pelion on Ossa, and so it is astonishing when one character suddenly
says 'I know not what, but it is something'. Yes, it sounds like Lear. And
the gore recalls Titus Andronicus. To Seneca, however, it probably closer to
home - he had lived through the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius.
Thyestes re-tells the most appalling crime in all Greek mythology. Atreus
(papa to Agamemnon) kills the children of his brother Thyestes and, in a
banquet, has him (unwitting) feed on their flesh and drink their blood. The
killing and eating occur offstage, the blood-drinking onstage. Why has
Churchill turned to this gruesome tale? Partly, I guess, because it
continues the macabre studies she entered in Lives of the Great Poisoners.
Partly because Seneca had such an influence on English drama. And partly
because Seneca probably did not write for the stage and because (again, I'm
guessing) Churchill is interested in subjects that elude conventional drama.
It would help, mind you, if she did more in the play's early stages to show
who is who. Which brother are we hearing talking about the other brother? It
takes too long to discover. But Churchill's translation skilfully points up
all the play's influence on Elizabethan drama, while investing it with some
welcome modernity of utterance. Listening to her text has its rewards for
the student of Seneca, of Churchill, and Eng. lit. Most of it, however, is
dull for the theatregoer.
It might be more gripping if James Macdonald had directed the play with more
variety of inflection. The style of acting is low-key. The intention may be
to put a layer of ice over the fire in these people's guts, but the effect
is mere tepidity. Accents come from all over the British Isles. (Thyestes
and Atreus - Ewan Stewart and Kevin McMonagle  - both sound Glaswegian.)
Videos show images of events offstage; we don't see Thyestes scoffing his
kids but we do see him in post-prandial plenitude. The tone is flat,
avoiding suspense.
The result only underlines how poor Seneca was at sustaining psychological
or dramatic interest on a moment-by-moment basis. It is amazing how he kept
all the feeblest features of Greek drama while ditching or muddling all the
best. Worst, I think, are the numerous crummy fortune-cookie utterances. 'No
luck lasts. Pain and delight take it in turns.' And - my nomination for
naffest sentiment - 'You'd have to be really greedy for life if you didn't
want to die when the whole world's dying with you.' Which may be true to
think, but, in mid-drama, is mighty silly to say.
