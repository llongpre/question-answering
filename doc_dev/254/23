   An ethics czar whose rulings would have the
force of law is needed to stiffen and standardize a welter of
federal rules, regulations and policies against conflict of
interest, according to members of a presidential commission.
   ``The ethics laws in government now are about like the Roman
Empire when Caligula was ... (using) small print in high places to
confuse the public. I'm confused,'' former Attorney General Griffin
Bell told President Bush's ethics commission at its first meeting
Tuesday.
   Bell, who is vice chairman of the eight-member panel, was among
the members who embraced the idea of establishing the ethics czar.
   ``We need a Judge Landis,'' said panel member Lloyd N. Cutler,
who was White House counsel to President Jimmy Carter. ``And one in
Congress as well.''
   Cutler referred to U.S. District Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis of
Chicago, who was named the first commissioner of major league
baseball in 1920 after members of the Chicago White Sox threw the
1919 World Series. Landis quickly assumed wide powers, including
banning some players from the game for life. His firm action was
credited with cleaning up what had become known as the Black Sox
scandal.
   No final recommendations were made at the first meeting of the
commission which has just one month to propose to Bush legislative
and administrative changes needed to improve federal ethics
enforcement.
   As the group debated which issues to address, Bell complained
that ``like the sumptuary laws in the 12th Century,'' federal ethics
rules apply differently to different people, depending on whether
they serve in Congress, the executive branch, the judiciary or the
military.
   ``Some people can do things and other people can't do the same
things,'' Bell said. ``But no one knows how to act. We should get
everyone the same rules if we can.''
   ``We need a czar,'' said the panel's chairman, former federal
appellate judge Malcolm R. Wilkey, adding that some congressmen he
has consulted with made the same suggestion.
   Wilkey said the czar ``should have the authority to enforce the
rules and to give advice that's legally binding. On the
congressional side, there ought to be a similar institution, an
independent authority outside.''
   Other members compared an ethics czar's advisory function to an
Internal Revenue Service program which issues advisory letters to
businesses and individuals who request guidance on specific tax
questions that arise in situations not clearly addressed in any tax
statute.
   Bell wondered whether the military would want its own czar and
whether the House and Senate would accept the same czar.
   But later he said, ``A czar's the only way it'll ever be solved.
We need someone like Landis, with real power and prestige. It
wouldn't work if there were too many, because it wouldn't be
prestigious enough.
   ``But if there was one, you could go and get advice that would
stand up. You could get a judge to take the post; a lot of judges
would like that job.''
   Outlining the wide review to be undertaken, Wilkey said the
commission staff is preparing a chart comparing how the executive
branch, Congress and the judiciary handle the same ethical
questions. No such document now exists in the government, he said.
   ``We're not likely to come up with any brilliant new ideas,''
Wilkey said. ``This is a well-plowed field. The problem is some of
the furrows run in different directions. Maybe we can straighten
them out.''
   During an initial discussion of restrictions on government
employees who return to private enterprise, the commissioners agreed
that some version of restrictions which now apply only in the
executive branch should be extended to Congress and the judiciary.
   They agreed to study whether a one-year ban ought to be placed on
dealings by former judges with their old court, and on dealings by
former members of Congress with the chamber in which they served.
   Morton Halperin of the American Civil Liberties Union, however,
pointed out after the meeting that the federal Office of Government
Ethics has said that existing post-employment restrictions do not
apply to the president and vice president because only the
Constitution can set the qualifications for election to federal
office.
   So, Halperin said, there might be objections to applying them to
members of Congress without amending the Constitution. One panel
member, former New Mexico Sen. Harrison H. Schmitt, agreed that was
an issue the group would have to discuss further before proceeding
with this recommendation.
   The members also expressed support for allowing scientific and
technical people more latitude to give advice in their areas of
expertise than is allowed lawyers, whose work involves cases which
are usually narrower and shorter than large military procurement
efforts.
   ``The United States will build only one new class of submarine
between now and the end of the century,'' said former Undersecretary
of the Navy R. James Woolsey. He said a sonar or submarine expert in
the government could not get a job in private enterprise without
having something to do with that.
   ``If they don't know what they can discuss in the lunch room for
two years after they leave the government, they just won't come into
the government in the first place,'' Woolsey said.
