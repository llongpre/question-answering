<F P=106> [Report by Alessandra Longo: "That League Member is an </F>
Anti-Semite'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- As soon as the news spread, she herself 
said: "Me, speaker of the chamber of deputies? We are in the 
Lord's hands...." This was yesterday afternoon, at Montecitorio 
[Chamber of Deputies]. A somewhat flustered Irene Pivetti, 
Giorgio Napolitano's [outgoing lower house Speaker] purported 
successor, was giving the first interviews -- surely a great day 
for her, the day when the development of new events was granting 
the soap opera a place in history: 31 years old, a Catholic 
fundamentalist, first-time deputy in 1992. Here was League 
member Pivetti suddenly being raised to the highest seat, that 
of the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. A meteoric, 
irresistible career in the second legislature. 
  Yet, some people were spoiling the party, not with the usual 
behind-the-scenes teasing and vulgarity, but with a sensitive, 
specific, extremely serious accusation: "Pivetti is an 
anti-Semite." It was being said by [Radical leader] Marco 
Pannella (who identified "anti-Semitic accents" in the newly 
nominated speaker); it was being said by [Forza Italia Deputy] 
Marco Taradash, "documents at hand"; it was being denounced by 
Democratic Alliance [AD] Republican member Luciana Sbarbati 
("among Pivetti's virtues, there is also anti-Semitism"); it was 
being asserted, indirectly, by progressive list deputies Sandra 
Bonsanti, Miriam Mafai, Luigi Manconi, and Giovanna Melandri, 
who were accusing her of fostering "a fundamentalist and 
intolerant idea of the relationship bewteen different religious 
denominations." 
  A rather unpleasant matter, on the eve of such an important 
appointment. The Jewish Youth Federation also voiced its 
protest. Suddenly, the smile on the face of Irene Pivetti, the 
"evil nun," as she is called by Michele Serra, turned into a 
grimace of annoyance and concern. The journalists pressed her, 
she had to give an answer: "Me, an anti-Semite? Political 
maneuvering, nonsense. Religion pervades my life, but it will 
not interfere in the least with my role as lower house speaker, 
which I intend to fulfill with the utmost sense of 
responsibility, giving assurances to all those involved." 
  In the meantime, her accusers did not let up, making 
remarks, 
statements, taking up positions. What did Irene Pivetti write 
in November 1992, following a raid in Rome against a number of 
Jewish-owned shops, which were branded with the star of David? 
That the events had been exaggerated for political reasons: "A 
roll of adhesive tape, a few sheets of paper with the Star of 
David printed on them, stuck on the shopwindows of a few Jewish 
shopkeepers...." Why "blow the racist hot air balloon out of all 
proportion?" In CORRIERE DELLA SERA, a concerned [journalist] 
Arrigo Levi cited the soon-to-be house speaker's analysis: "In 
our country, since the postwar period, Pivetti writes, Jews have 
always been able to preserve that racial, religious, and 
cultural minority's identity which they so treasure: marrying 
only among themselves (if practicing), considering themselves a 
people chosen by God, extending their considerable economic, 
intellectual, and political influence within the community...." 
  Among the spoilsports, Marco Taradash brought up an old 
question: Did his deputy colleague remember referring to a 
"Jewish Freemasonry" in relation to a list of Italian citizens 
who were considered anti-Semites, a list in which she was 
herself included, "in black and white?" No, in response to this 
specific question, the deputy said she did not remember: "Did I 
speak of a Jewish Freemasonry? One should look at the 
context...." 
  That would be enough to make anyone's nerves crack, but not 
those of Napolitano's successor -- icy stare, Vandee 
[18th-century Catholic monarchist opposition to French 
revolutionary forces] cross round her neck. Speaker of the 
house at 31, with Forza Italia's and National Alliance's [AN] 
blessing; she, Algo Bagrielli's granddaughter, curator of her 
grandfather's dictionary; she, CEI [Italian Bishops' Conference] 
and Ruini's passionate enemy; she, the bandwagon's [League 
nickname] runaway horse, that only [League secretary] Bossi can 
rein in ("I owe him everything, I owe him the fact that I 
engaged in politics, I would never criticize his decisions....") 
-- she is just one step away from a miracle; we will see what 
happens today. 
  What can she do if journalists insist on this anti-Semitism 
story. The deputy goes her way and, " knife in mouth" (one of 
her expressions), upholds her ideas. She tore to bits Law 194 
on abortion ("but it is a state law and must be implemented, 
particularly the part fostering contraception"); had something 
conceited to say about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi 9 
[outgoing lower house Speaker] ("a lucky man, who is also 
showing he is a good politician"); drew a distinction when it 
came to the latter's TV networks ("He cannot get rid of them in 
15 days. The essential thing is that he serve the country's 
interests"); made a noncommital remark about Mussolini, in line 
with an irrepressible instinct for appeasement ("whether for 
better or worse, he made part of this country's history"). 
<H5>  Ironical Colleagues Consider Her a "Doll" </H5>
  Here are some reactions to League Catholic member Irene 
Pivetti's nomination as speaker of the lower house: Alfredo 
Biondi (Center Union): "Me, deputy speaker? With a speaker who 
is not absolutely below standard, in fact with a high-quality 
one, I might agree. I am thinking of Iotti, Napolitano, or 
Rodota, but I have no intention of being an employee, a civil 
servant, giving lessons to kids or...dolls." Later Biondi 
explained that he was joking with some friends when a journalist 
overheard these comments and published them. 
  Massimo Scalia (Greens): "For thousands of years we Romans 
have been used to tolerance and to history's vicissitudes. Ever 
since Caligula nominated a horse as senator, nothing surprises 
us any more." 
  Rocco Buttiglione (Italian Popular Party): "I am very much 
in favor. It will raise the institutions' esthetic standards. 
It will help us bear the incredible boring sessions in store 
for us. This, however, is not enough to become the speaker of 
the house. I am very much afraid I cannot give her my vote." 
  Vittorio Sgarbi (Forza Italia): "Pivetti for speaker of the 
house? I would also have nominated her. I cannot imagine a 
more representative and appropriate personality: We move from 
the contemplation of the Madonna [reference to President 
Scalfaro's frequent references to the Virgin Mary] to the 
Madonna herself."
