   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has
accused Penthouse magazine of trying to destroy his ministry through
a ``diabolical and slanderous'' story in which a stripper says she
performed sexual acts for him.
   The stripper's employer labeled the woman's allegations, detailed
in the magazine's current issue, ``a pornographic fairy tale.'' As
Swaggart threatened to file a libel suit Monday, the magazine said
it was standing by its article.
   The allegations by the woman, Catherine Mary Kampen, are similar
to those levied last year by a prostitute, Debra Murphree. Those
allegations led to Swaggart's ouster from the Assemblies of God, a
Pentecostal denomination, and a major downturn in the fortunes of
Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   ``There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I have
never met or seen the woman,'' Swaggart said at a news conference at
his ministry headquarters.
   ``Our attorneys learned of this fraudulent story in December and
had clearly shown Penthouse and its porno writer, Art Harris (the
author), that the story was untrue,'' Swaggart said. ``We now know
that they already knew and did not care that it was a lie.''
   Penthouse spokesman Sy Presten issued a statement for publisher
Bob Guccione saying the magazine stood behind the story.
   ``The fact that she was with Swaggart has been corroborated by
her husband and others in Louisiana,'' the statement said. ``The
things she reports Swaggart made her do are very similar to the
story of Debra Murphree ... which have never been contradicted.''
   Kampen, 38, was quoted in Penthouse as saying Swaggart gained her
trust with his counseling, then emotionally manipulated her into
acting out sexual fantasies.
   She was reported to be in New York for promotional appearances
about the article and could not be reached for additional comment.
   Rhonda Shear, co-owner of ``Hot Lines,'' a strip-tease telegram
service that employs Kampen in New Orleans, said her sister, Nona,
told her that Kampen made up the story after seeing the Penthouse
account of Murphree's relations with Swaggart.
   ``She told my sister it was all concocted,'' Shear said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``She saw the issue with Debra
Murphree (and said) ... `It's only a matter of time before someone
jumps on that band wagon. Why not me?' ... She said it was foolproof
if she said it happened at her house.''
   Shear's sister, contacted in New Orleans, said a lawyer had
advised her not to comment. She refused to confirm her sister's
story.
   At the news conference, Swaggart accused Penthouse of conspiring
to destroy his ministry and asked for public support.
   ``I am appealing to the American people, and especially the
Christians, to help us by letting the pornographers know they have
filled this land with their filth far too long. There seems to be no
end to their diabolical slander.''
   Attorney Dennis Brewer, a member of the ministries' board of
directors, said Monday that a lawsuit would be filed within the next
few days in Texas, where punitive damages are permitted in libel
actions.
   Last February, Swaggart confessed to an undisclosed sin, and
Murphree said she had been paid by the evangelist to perform sex
acts while he watched. Swaggart later was defrocked by the
Assemblies of God after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at
least a year.
   The furor resulted in the cancellation of Swaggart's programs
from three major cable television networks, an exodus of students
and faculty from his Bible college and layoffs from the ministry, a
major Baton Rouge employer.
