   The devil is alive and well, hustling suckers in
a cheap bar on Nashville's Music Row. But he meets his match in
Billy Markham, something of a hustler himself, willing to risk
everything on the throw of the dice.
   Their contest for Billy's body and soul is recounted with
rip-snorting, raunchy delight in ``The Devil and Billy Markham,''
one half of a hilarious double bill entitled ``Oh, Hell,'' which
opened Sunday at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center.
   Shel Silverstein wrote the Billy Markham saga, and David Mamet
contributed the second part of the evening, called ``Bobby Gould in
Hell,'' which also features a highly unusual and comic Lucifer.
   Silverstein's play is a monologue, a tall tale told in verse by
actor Dennis Locorriere, a one-time member of the rock group Dr.
Hook. Looking like a refugee from the California Gold Rush,
Locorriere _ all shaggy hair and wild beard _ acts, sings and
dances his way through Billy's various bouts with the devil and God
Himself. It's a pheonomenal performance, not to mention a feat of
prodigious memorization.
   Silverstein, poet, cartoonist and author of the country hit ``A
Boy Named Sue,'' tweaks just about everybody in his short play. Its
highlight is a song about the marriage of the devil to Billy's one
true love. The celebrity list runs from Gertrude Stein to Grandma
Moses, from Caligula to Eva Braun. For Silverstein, the devil
appears to be a part of just about everybody.
   In Mamet's equally brief one-acter, the devil _ called the
interrogator _ harasses a new arrivee named Bobby Gould in an
anteroom to hell that looks like a well-appointed study. It's
complete with a spiffy leather couch and walls of books. Only when
he opens a backdoor can you hear the screams and see the smoke of
Hades.
   Bobby, played with credible anxiety by Treat Williams, keeps
insisting he was a good man. Not so, says the devil. ``You were
cruel without being interesting,'' says Satan, portrayed here by an
exasperated, almost frenzied W.H. Macy. The actor is dressed like a
walking advertising for the L.L. Bean catalog. You see, Lucifer has
been called back from a fishing trip to deal with Bobby and is
mighty upset about the interruption.
   Bobby's spurned girlfriend (Felicity Huffman) also shows up to
condemn him, and the devil has a drudge assistant, played with a
wonderful prissy rectitude by Steven Goldstein, to further browbeat
the man.
   The pingpong banter is sharp, often quite biting, and the
production is tauntly directed by Gregory Mosher who uses several
startling theatrical effects.
   ``The Devil and Billy Markham'' and ``Bobby Gould in Hell''
don't exactly celebrate Beelzebub but they recognize his effect on
what people say and do. And what they say and do, according to
Silverstein and Mamet, is very, very funny.
