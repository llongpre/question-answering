   Officials confirmed Tuesday that the woman who
claims in Penthouse magazine that she performed sexual acts for
television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has a string of arrests in the
New Orleans area.
   Swaggart's attorneys distributed documents showing that Catherine
Mary Kampen had been arrested in Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard
parishes on various charges, including theft and issuing bad checks.
   The documents were distributed at a news conference Monday during
which Swaggart vehemently denied knowing Kampen and threatened to
sue the magazine.
   Kampen, a 38-year-old stripper, claims in the March issue of
Penthouse that she was Swaggart's ``sex slave'' for six months. The
magazine quotes Kampen as saying Swaggart demanded that she perform
sadomasochistic and degrading acts.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God last year and saw
his international ministries rocked by allegations that he paid a
New Orleans prostitute to perform sex acts for him. He confessed at
that time to an unspecified sin but never discussed the accusations
made by the prostitute, Debra Murphree.
   On Monday, Swaggart accused Penthouse of trying to destroy his
ministry through a ``diabolical and slanderous'' story.
   ``Feel free to publish anything you like,'' Swaggart warned the
magazine at a news conference Monday, ``but be prepared to back it
up in court.''
   Penthouse Publisher Bob Guccione said in a statement Monday that
he stood behind the story.
   Penthouse spokesman Sy Presten said the terms of Kampen's
contract with the magazine prevented her from talking to the press,
but ``we're working on setting up a press conference next week.''
   Kampen's arrest record is mentioned in passing in the Penthouse
article. Art Harris, who wrote the piece, said the arrests were
minor.
   ``You wouldn't expect someone who got into this situation to have
the background of a nun,'' he said Tuesday.
   Harris refused to comment on charges by Ronda Shear, co-owner of
the strip-tease telegram service that employs Kampen, that the woman
had concocted the story after seeing a Penthouse story on Murphree.
   According to records distributed by Swaggart's lawyers, Kampen
was arrested in Jefferson Parish on Dec. 30, 1986, and charged with
criminal damage to property and theft of under $100. Kampen was
convicted and paid a $200 fine and court costs, said Linda Simpson
of the district attorney's office.
   On Aug. 17, 1973, Kampen was arrested and charged with issuing
worthless checks in St. Bernard Parish. She was given one year's
probation and fined $40.
   Kampen was arrested in New Orleans on Jan. 10, 1972, under the
name of Cathy M. Smith, and charged with using a stolen driver's
license and forged receipt to get $53 from a department store. Court
records confirm she was fined $100 and received a suspended
six-month jail sentence.
