   A 36-year-old woman who claims Penthouse
publisher Bob Guccione ruined her acting career by putting her in a
pornographic film is asking a court to award her $10 million in
damages.
   The former model, Anneka DiLorenzo, says Guccione reneged on a
verbal contract to help her career.
   But Guccione defended himself in state Supreme Court Thursday by
arguing that Ms. DiLorenzo got the exposure she needed but ruined
her own career by rejecting three movie offers and disappearing with
a boyfriend.
   ``She simply turned her back on us and went off to Florida in a
drunken spree'' in 1978, Guccione said. He testified he urged Ms.
DiLorenzo to sign a management contract with Penthouse in 1973 and
to let him guide her career.
   Ms. DiLorenzo said in court papers that Guccione was a ``sadistic
evil person'' who ruined her career by putting her in ``Caligula,''
a film loosely based on the life of the mad Roman emperor.
   The two-hour, 23-minute movie, which features bloody tortures and
hard-core sex of almost every variety, includes an explicit sex
scene involving Ms. DiLorenzo and another woman.
   The movie was shown to Justice Elliott Wilk, who is hearing the
trial without a jury. ``Does this movie ever end?'' he asked at one
point.
   ``It kind of makes you appreciate Pee Wee Herman, doesn't it?''
Wilk said.
   When the sex scene featuring Ms. DiLorenzo appeared on the
screen, she fled the courtroom in tears and remained in the women's
restroom for more than 30 minutes.
   Ms. DiLorenzo said Guccione fired her in 1980 when she refused to
accompany him to Japan on a promotional tour for the movie. She said
he had promised her that in return for her years of cooperation with
the magazine, she would always be ``part of his Penthouse family.''
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, said Ms. Lorenzo admits she
has no proof that Guccione ever made such a promise.
   In her deposition, Ms. DiLorenzo said: ``I don't have any written
contracts with Guccione. He and I had verbal agreements. We were
partners in life.''
