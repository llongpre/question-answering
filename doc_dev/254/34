Tributes to mark Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday on April 14 were
frustrated last month when a campaign to have London's Apollo Theatre
renamed in his honour was rejected by its owner, Stoll Moss.
It was a rare display of dissent about the actor regarded by his many
admirers as keeper of the theatrical flame; last in that distinguished
lineage which, through his great-aunt Ellen Terry, connects him to Irving,
Kean and beyond even to Shakespeare.
The Stoll Moss controversy is a contrast to the general adulation. Only the
Queen Mother's birthday, according to one recent eulogy, prompts comparable
'gratitude and rejoicing'. Perhaps, but just as the role of the monarchy is
being questioned, Gielgud's artistic legacy surely demands more critical
appraisal.
'Times have changed,' argues Nica Burns, production director at Stoll Moss.
'I was recently negotiating for a light variety production to come to the
Apollo and was somewhat perturbed when its two young producers, one of them
under 30, told me they would take the show elsewhere if the theatre was
renamed.'
Such disrespect is uncommon among the profession's younger generation, even
though most are only familiar with Gielgud through his sometimes unwise
choice of screen appearances. While Olivier received an Oscar for Hamlet,
Gielgud won his for playing Dudley Moore's foul-mouthed valet in the
lamentable Arthur.
Too often, he has squandered his talents on a succession of dons, dukes and
other patrician bit parts, most notoriously as a senator in Penthouse Films'
soft porn Caligula. On television he has fared better. The 'doorknob face'
that Kenneth Tynan described has lately been seen assisting both Inspectors
Morse and Alleyn in the course of their inquiries, though this year
threatens the US mini-series, Scarlett, an unpromising sequel to Gone With
the Wind.
Bills must be paid, insists Gielgud, and, Lear aside, good roles for
nonagenarians are few. Tomorrow night he plays the 'foolish, fond old man'
one last time in a Radio 3 broadcast co-produced by Kenneth Branagh's now
disbanded Renaissance Theatre Company. Radio provides the perfect medium for
Gielgud's famous vocal agility. As Peter Greenaway, who directed him in
Prospero's Books in 1991, observed: 'His qualities are not physical - he has
a magnificent voice and a thinking mind.'
Tim Supple, artistic director of the Young Vic, witnessed Gielgud's
recording of the Ghost in Branagh's 1992 radio production of Hamlet. 'When
he read, a sound came from him that one just doesn't hear,' he recalls.
'It was remarkable and immediately put you in touch with the sensation in
the words, something that is not available when any modern actor speaks
text. It was an awesome feeling. One sensed there was something impenetrably
old about what was being done by him.
'It still had a magic spell but also not quite life.'
Gielgud claims to dislike what Branagh calls his 'miraculous' tones, though
he has confessed that as a youth he could make himself weep simply by
listening to his own voice. His plummy declamation and unfettered tear ducts
offer rich pickings for satirists, who also point to the taste for cravats,
the oft-repeated anecdotes and the peacocks at his Buckinghamshire home as
evidence of actorly affectation. Indeed, an earlier attempt to have the
Queen's Theatre renamed after Gielgud was dropped when a producer pointed
out it would invariably be dubbed the Old Queen's.
But if Gielgud is guilty of the self-obsession customary in actors, it
springs from commitment to his craft. Certainly, he is immersed in acting to
the exclusion of all else.
Beverley Nichols recalled a visit from Gielgud in the 1930s. 'We were
sitting around wondering whether we were all going to be swept up in the
approaching holocaust. 'Why don't you turn on the radio,' said John. 'There
isn't one,' I replied. 'Excellent news,' said John, 'because I shall be able
to listen to myself talking.' And talk, he did, brilliantly, till the small
hours - not about Hitler or Mussolini or any of the ogres haunting us, but
about the theatre, which was all he knew about or thought important in this
distracted world.'
But the mood of post war society and its theatre was out of tune with
Gielgud's often mannered style of acting. While he was collecting a
knighthood in the Coronation honours, Ionesco was dispensing with language -
the tool of Gielgud's trade - as an adequate form of communication. At the
same time, Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop was launching a working-class
assault on the genteel complacency of post-war drama, based on a physicality
which Gielgud, with his self-conscious gait, has never possessed.
'Gielgud is an Edwardian; he must still hear the echoes of Ellen Terry,'
says Littlewood. 'In that horizon which he sees and which is in his
background, I think he is superb - an opinion I don't extend to the rest of
his generation. But because old Olivier, whom I couldn't stand, did that
appalling Osborne play The Entertainer, Gielgud wanted to move into that
dubious world too.
'He asked to work with me and, although I would have loved him to play
Edward II, he didn't want to. He wanted to do something new to match Look
Back in Anger. Later, I was given free tickets to go and see him in a modern
play. I thought, 'Oh my God, he's not dressed. And where's the poetry?' I
couldn't get over it.'
However anxious to move with the times (his performances in Storey and
Pinter were much praised), Gielgud has seldom been comfortable with the
avant-garde, preferring the old school reassurance of Coward or Rattigan. He
dissuaded Alec Guinness and Ralph Richardson from acting in Waiting for
Godot and, in 1958, declined to appear in the British premiere of Endgame
('It nauseates me. I hate it and I won't play it'). He opted instead to take
his tried and tested Shakespeare readings, The Ages of Man, on a tour of
North America, a caution that has persisted into later life.
He remained rooted in the decorous conventions of half a century ago.
'What has happened in the theatre from Beckett onwards has happened without
Gielgud,' says Tim Supple. 'He has not left a legacy of breakthrough as have
directors like Peter Brook and actors like Olivier, who was dangerous and
kept on being so. One looks at Gielgud as a package of things that were
about England and about English acting. And yet when you watch him as
Clarence in Olivier's Richard III you realise he was a master. To be fair,
he delights in the radical things happening around him.'
This deference is shared by Supple's contemporary, Dominic Dromgoole,
artistic director of the Bush Theatre, who believes Gielgud should be
'cherished and revered as a sublime monument to a certain sort of theatre'.
If that sort of theatre is now ebbing away, the affection for Gielgud
endures vicissitudes of fashion. As Edgar says of Lear: 'The oldest hath
borne most; we that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long.'
