   Larry Flynt offered a self-styled soldier of
fortune $1 million to kill rival sex magazine publishers Hugh Hefner
and Bob Guccione, and Frank Sinatra and Walter Annenberg,
authorities said.
   The purported hitman, Mitchell WerBell, died of a heart attack in
December 1983 about a month after Flynt gave him the check,
sheriff's Capt. Robert Grimm said Wednesday night. WerBell was in
his 60s when he died of natural causes, authorities said.
   Flynt's alleged motive was not disclosed and no charges have been
filed against him.
   Grimm told a news conference that information about the plot
turned up recently in an investigation of the 1983 murder-for-hire
slaying of New York theater producer Roy Radin, whom authorities
said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the movie ``The
Cotton Club.''
   A former Flynt bodyguard, William Mentzer, is one of four
defendants charged in Radin's killing.
   Investigators have not interviewed the Hustler magazine publisher
and have not presented a case to the prosecutor, Grimm said. He
declined to elaborate and said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman
Block spoke about the purported plot earlier in the day because he
had been approached by the news media.
   ``Our investigation is continuing,'' Grimm said.
   Grimm identified targets of the alleged plot as Hefner, Sinatra
and Guccione. He declined to name a fourth person targeted, but
authorities told KNBC-TV that person was Annenberg, the publishing
magnate and former ambassador.
   ``Larry Flynt one evening called an individual by the name of
WerBell to his home and allegedly offered him $1 million if he would
arrange for the death of these four individuals,'' said Block,
adding he took the matter seriously.
   ``I've been led to believe that Larry Flynt has a propensity to
try to harm people he sees as his enemies, whether (over) business
arrangements or whatever.''
   A woman at Flynt's office told The Associated Press Flynt ``just
said he doesn't make comments on trash like that.''
   WerBell was an international arms dealer who developed the MAC-10
submachine gun. He called himself a retired general of the Royal
Free Afghan Army, according to promotional material from his
Georgia-based counterterrorism firm, Sionics Inc., released by the
sheriff's department.
   Grimm displayed a photocopy of a $1 million check allegedly
signed by Flynt and made out to WerBell.
   Block said a Flynt associate immediately stopped payment on the
check so it never was negotiated.
   The year of the alleged plot, Flynt claimed to have knowledge of
videotapes purportedly showing Vicki Morgan, mistress of the late
Diners Club founder Alfred Bloomingdale, engaged in sexual antics
with Reagan administration officials.
   The tapes were never proven to exist.
   At the time, Flynt was heavily sedated with drugs to assuage pain
from wounds that left him paralyzed after a 1978 assassination
attempt during an obscenity trial in Georgia.
   Hefner, publisher of Playboy magazine, said his place on the list
was the price of celebrity. ``It's part of being famous in the later
part of the 20th century,'' he said in a statement. ``I have no
association with those who made up the list or those whose names
appear on it.''
   Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, said he had been
informed about the alleged plot by a Flynt bodyguard some time ago.
   Susan Reynolds, publicist for Sinatra, said the entertainer had
no comment.
   A telephone call to Annenberg's Palm Springs home was answered by
a woman who said he was on the East Coast and wouldn't be
immediately available for comment.
