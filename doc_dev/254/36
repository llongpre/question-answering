Lehal Weapon 3 is a variety show masquerading as a movie. Let us define our
terms. A movie is something that moves, both in its individual images and
its governing plot momentum. A variety show is a menu of entertainment items
composed of colourful but unrelated turns.
So here for their latest encore is that popular police double-act Riggs and
Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover), their comic rapport built as ever on
the tension between psychotic unpredictability (Riggs) and sciatic
middle-aged alarmism (Murtaugh).
Here, in an I-say-I-say cameo role, is Joe Pesci's Leo Getz, the comical
accountant from Lethal Weapon 2. Here, bounding in from the wings, is the
latest version of that silver-screen crowd-pleaser, the villain played by an
English actor (Stuart Wilson, following on the cloven heels of Rickman and
Hopkins).
And here is the plethora of stunt set-pieces - the freeway chase against the
traffic flow, the blown-up office block - that have no more strict narrative
relevance than 'Bring on the acrobats' at the Palladium.
This is not a criticism, it is a genial, realistic acceptance. What, after
all, does one do with a collection of familiar multicoloured balls except
find different ways to juggle with them? Mozart did this in The Marriage Of
Figaro, taking over from Rossini to give us The Barber Of Seville 2.
Shakespeare did it with Falstaff in The Merry Wives Of Windsor, alias Fatman
Returns.
What matters is the wit deployed, and Lethal Weapon 3 should send the
charabancs away happy. The plot about a homicidal drug-dealer (Wilson) and
his attention-catching outrages is no more than an excuse for another
action-and-comedy gala. And top of the bill are back-chat stars Gibson and
Glover.
Glover is the one gasping in disbelief or groaning in dismay while Gibson -
show him a blue touch-paper and he will light it - is the one going his
berserk way to demotion and back.
Wild of mane, jittery of smile and baby-blue of eyes, Gibson is the triumph
of the whole Lethal Weapon show. He is to law enforcement what Caligula was
to civil administration. Show him an unexploded bomb (scene one) and he will
tease it lovingly until it explodes. Serve him up a nice juicy suspect
(scene 22) and he will clatter him about the head first and ask questions,
if at all, later. This is the vigilante cop taken to its supra-mythic
extreme: beyond iconisation to the finer stratospheres of camp.
The film is in large part nonsense - have we tried to hide that from you?
But as a recent series of beer advertisements unlidding the dustbins of the
stars suggests, we are all fascinated by rubbish, especially when it comes
with a VIP stamp of ownership. This rubbish was directed by Richard Donner,
of The Omen, Superman and the earlier Lethal Weapons, and it was written by
Jeffrey Boam of LW 2 and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. Enjoy]
* * * 'Let your body rest on the clouds, let your breasts fly off into the
cosmos. . .' Thus the holistic birth adviser to her ante-natal class in
Jackie McKimmie's Waiting.
This comedy of pricked pretensions from Australia is a delight. With its
hang-loose script, home-made camerawork and cast of endearing losers - a
pregnant painter (Noni Hazlehurst) and the four women friends, plus dazed
menfolk, who crowd her battered farmhouse to await the birth - it could be a
Robert Altman film re-planted in the Antipodes.
Yet McKimmie's solidarity with her characters makes the movie more than a
multitarget satire. The bullseyes may be regularly struck: the mystic
deliriums of natural birth advisers; the hypocrisy of agitprop hobbyists
like the baby's father (Frank Whitten), fasting for freedom until his first
sight of a McDonalds; the fanaticism of career feminists, incarnated in
Fiona Press as a plump frump hoping to film the birth for a documentary
attacking the patriarchal medical profession.
But the central dilemma of surrogate motherhood - Hazlehurst is carrying the
baby for a friend who cannot have one - is explored in all its sacrificial
agony. As each character in turn is toppled from his or her high moral
perch, shaken by the tremors of the cunningly chaotic plot, our heroine is
the last to choose between dogmatic posture and truth to self.
At this point, the film swaps its raggedy colours and camera movements for a
brief spell of Australian School gilded lens-work. Is it mocking its own
cinematic ancestry? Probably. For we are soon back to chaos, visual and
comedic, as the baby is delivered into a world where l'age d'or idealism has
been finally scuppered by the human frailties we know, love and could hardly
live without.
If Waiting is a feminist's satire on Feminism - a lower-case idealist's
onslaught on Upper-case Ideologues - Without You I'm Nothing is a shot from
the same locker. Sandra Bernhard, rubber-faced US comedienne, stands and
delivers her one-woman show for the camera much as she did for six
successful months (we are told) in an off-Broadway theatre.
Targets: pretension, pop culture, white-Anglo-Saxon-protestant America and,
yes, Feminism. Method of attack: lateral lampoonery. Bernhard favours
impersonations of the famous (Cher, Streisand, Diana Ross, even Prince) to
deliver her airy, idiotic, precision-timed monologues followed by songs.
With her voice like a mosquito-whine and her face like a rubber duck pressed
against a window, this performer is an acquired taste. I did not acquire it
in her only previous major film, The King Of Comedy, where she played the
demented groupie who helps kidnap Jerry Lewis. I acquired it in five minutes
here. Bernhard's main trick is to look straight at the camera with a
withering Michigan-Jewish girl's honesty and then lie or tease like hell.
Cultural groupies are her favourite spoof victims - 'Andy (Warhol) really
understood the concept of potlatch' - closely followed by philosophising pop
singers. Musing on the decline of Western civilisation, she says 'Perhaps
Cher said it best ..': then she launches into a Cher-wigged ballad of cosmic
melancholy. Catch this dry, funny treat on screen; and then catch Miss
Bernhard live, if you will, on her late-August British tour.
* * * Finally, your choice for the kiddywinks. Would you prefer a Disney
musical about New York newsboys or a cartoon about a frog working for MI5?
Since both plumb depths of inconsequentiality unsurpassed even this summer,
you may prefer to take the children to Alton Towers or a day with Auntie
Madge.
The News Boys is like some nightmare interbreeding of Oliver] with Annie.
The screen fills with running, jumping and singing street urchins as a plot
unfolds about the Brooklyn newsboys' strike of the 1890s. 'It's a fine fine
life]' they yodel (even the lyrics are borrowed from Lionel Bart) as they
cartwheel through back-lot streets, led by Britain's Christian Bale (Empire
Of The Sun) flexing a dese-dem-dose accent as the young strike-leader.
Robert Duvall (Joseph Pulitzer) and Ann-Margret (cabaret singer) raise their
heads briefly above the parapet before retiring in shock. And Teddy
Roosevelt, or an actor-lookalike, rolls in at the close to fold up the plot.
It is as tuneless and witless an experience as I have had since the school
production I appeared in of Fings Ain't Wot The Used To Be. ('A disaster':
school magazine). Kenny Ortega directed.
As for Jon Acevski's Freddie As FRO7., a cartoon feature in which a
secret-service frog saves Britain from a wicked Snake Queen who is stealing
the national monuments (Big Ben, the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace), we
quail at thoughts of your children's revenge if you subject them to it. They
will probably arrange a return treat by taking you to the Tower of London
and leaving you there. Dotty plot, drab characterisations, tuneless tunes:
back, British animation, to the drawing board.
