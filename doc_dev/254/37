   TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who has
threatened a libel suit for a stripper's story of an alleged sexual
liaison with him, said Wednesday that he knows of another effort
being planned to discredit him.
   Speaking to about 600 people at his Family Worship Center,
Swaggart again accused Penthouse magazine of scheming to destroy his
ministry with a story in which Catherine Mary Kampen said she
performed sex acts for him while he watched.
   Without revealing any details, Swaggart said his ministry had
uncovered another move against him. Swaggart said the plan involved
different people.
   ``There's another effort afoot, as preposterous as this one ...
If you have enough money you can get anyone to say anything,''
Swaggart said.
   Kampen's allegations are similar to those raised last year by a
prostitute, Debra Murphree, which led to Swaggart's ouster from the
Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination, and reversed the
fortunes of Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   Kampen's employer labeled the stripper's allegations, detailed in
Penthouse's current issue, ``a pornographic fairy tale.'' The
magazine said Monday that it was standing by its article.
   On Monday, Swaggart said there was ``not one shred of truth to
these allegations. I have never met or seen the woman.'' Swaggart's
attorneys said they had evidence the story was a hoax, but refused
to discuss specifics.
   Wednesday night, Swaggart said the ministry was approached by a
man in December who knew of Kampen's allegations ``and spilled his
insides ... he said he believed it was a hoax.''
   Swaggart also said a woman he identified as Kampen's employer
also called the ministry and said she knew the story was false.
Swaggart did not reveal the caller's name.
   Rhonda Shear, co-owner of a ``strip-o-gram'' service that employs
Kampen in New Orleans, said Monday that her sister, Nona, told her
Kampen made up the story after seeing the Penthouse story on
Murphree's relations with Swaggart.
   Shear's sister, contacted in New Orleans, said a lawyer had
advised her not to comment. Efforts to reach Kampen for comment have
been unsuccessful.
   Swaggart said the man who revealed Kampen's story to the ministry
had told him Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione was angry because of
Swaggart's work in pressuring convenience stores to discontinue
carrying the men's magazine.
   A telephone call after business hours Wednesday, seeking comment
from Penthouse's spokesmen at their New York City offices was not
answered.
   Swaggart said that during the past year, he had ``learned not to
judge people. I've learned that I'm not God.'' He also advised his
congregation not to ``get to the point where it's `us' and `them.'''
   His ministry would continue with expanded television programming
to China, Brazil and the Netherlands, Swaggart said. ``We are going
to go forward to tell the story of Jesus Christ as we have never
gone forth before,'' he said.
