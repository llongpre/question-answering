   A federal judge dismissed on technical grounds a $400 million lawsuit brought by publisher Robert C. Guccione challenging the government's conduct in the Abscam investigation. 

   Mr. Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, claimed the widely publicized Abscam corruption probe had unfairly harmed his reputation and prevented him from obtaining financing for a proposed Penthouse hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Mr. Guccione alleged in the 1984 lawsuit that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's lead Abscam informant had unsuccessfully tried to get Mr. Guccione to bribe a state casino-licensing official, and then made "false and unfounded" remarks about Mr. Guccione to prospective lenders. 

   In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley said the U.S. can't be sued for deciding to investigate Mr. Guccione or for alleged wrongdoing by the informant. 
She also said Mr. Guccione should have known by March 1982 that he had been investigated and that his suit was therefore barred by a two-year statute of limitations. 
Mr. Guccione has appealed the ruling. 

   In July, Penthouse won a $129.9 million judgment against a savings and loan that a judge found had breached an agreement to provide financing for the proposed casino.
