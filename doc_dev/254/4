'Le theatre n'est pas un jeu, c'est la conviction', Camus once said. It has
taken the conservative Comedie Francaise over 50 years to risk Camus' drama
of existentialist conviction, but now amends have been made. The theatre's
first Caligula (to June 24) is a stunning production.
Camus' drama follows the facts of Suetonius' history, but his hero is an
existentialist philosophe housed in the body of a Roman dictator: the mad
logic of nihilism drives this Caligula to tyranny. The play was written in
1938 but war delayed performance until 1945, when it was seized on as a
prophetic wonder which had anticipated Hitler. 'Our century is the century
of fear', wrote Camus, but he always denied the precise political analogy,
and time has proved 'Caligula' a broader statement of the themes of fear,
despair, nihilism.
Youssef Chahine revives it as a vision of contemporary horror: urban
violence, terrorism, mass media as both a creator of dangerous orthodoxies
and a force for banalising our responses to them. Inserts of films and other
non-conventional staging - Chahine is a film-maker - underline the
interpretation. The result is chic, radical and, to foreign eyes at least,
typically Parisian in its mix of philosophy, politics and stylish
aesthetics.
Sandwiched between crumbling classical columns and stone walls, a huge steel
and glass office block rises to the roof of the Comedie Francaise stage.
Sometimes, it reflects a cityscape painted on panels in the wings; sometimes
it is a screen projecting rabble-rousing crowd scenes or Caligula's face,
many times enlarged, as it booms out to the audience while the dictator
stands dwarfed beneath it. A forum at the front also merges old and new:
ruined arches and pillars, flights of stone steps, a yellow moped, flashing
roadwork lights, cordons, signposts.
The ancient/modern mix suggests Rome, but Chahine widens the image to any
city. Drills whirr, workmen in helmets alternate with wailing veiled women
at an Islamic funeral, an old pinstriped banker shuffles round the rubble;
kids lounge on the steps, cameramen from 'Satellite TV' pop up from each
corner. As on television, the exotic cuts into the everyday: Chahine shares
Camus' North African background and recalls it through an Arab bazaar, and
in the drums and tambourines of Mohamed Nouh's specially composed music.
By contrast the Roman patricians are the western, chattering classes: puffed
up in gold togas, they sample grapes, prattle, giggle and massage one
another - a smoke-filled box in the auditorium is converted to a Roman bath
for the evening. This sort of decadence needs a Caligula, suggests Chahine:
Jean-Ives Dubois, lean and long in black tracksuit, swivels round in an
office chair, cool, efficient, deliberate in movement, calm in his
dissection of their false values: 'Les hommes meurent, et ils ne sont pas
heureux'.
The drama is that he loses his sanity as the patrician-puppets, and
especially Cherea (Michel Favory), grow through fear and bereavement into
warm, vulnerable characters. Backed by screen and microphone, Dubois becomes
an automaton of terror, only human - and comic - in his crazy obsession that
his slave will fetch him the moon, symbol of impossible attainment
(according to history, Caligula had a moon fetish.)
Black humour hints at rather than wallows in violence: the menace of
Caligula got up like Botticelli's Venus, emerging from below the stage and
demanding obeisance; corpses wheeled across Caligula's diner party and
ignored; a speeded-up poetry competition where each poet is allowed a few
seconds to speak, and the last one only to part his lips, before black hoods
are thrust over them and they are lead off to execution. Fights are stylised
into acrobatics. Caligula and the poet Scipio (Lilah Dadi, a touching blend
of worldliness and naivety) joust while turning somersaults on a trampoline;
there are jugglers, knife-throwers, a danse macabre of punks and soldiers
slicing into one another.
To reveal the dynamics of the climax would be to play spoilsport; but in a
mix of old-fashioned theatrical chill and clever cinematic tricks Chahine
pulls his themes together and has Caligula, tragic hero in spite of all,
literally reaching for the moon. But every scene is dramatically inventive,
different, and acted and choreographed with consummate skill and apparent
ease. Cumulatively they question everyday assumptions, moral tabs, political
involvement (Favory's Cherea, reluctantly bloodstained, points a dripping
hand at the audience), our own distancing of terror as it is 'stylised' by
repetition on the small screen. This is the most exciting theatre in Paris
since Peter Brook's multi-cultural Tempest here two years ago.
