   Penthouse magazine Publisher Bob Guccione has agreed to buy the troubled Saturday Review, a publication built on catering to good taste. 

   The price wasn't disclosed, but a few years ago when the Review's owner, Saturday Review Limited Partners, Washington, D.C., was looking for a buyer, the asking price was reported as $3.5 million, according to the Associated Press. 
A Penthouse spokeswoman declined to discuss the price. 

   Mr. Guccione also publishes Omni, a monthly science magazine, and Forum, a pocket-sized magazine featuring articles on sexual matters. 

   Mr. Guccione said of his new acquisition, "I believe it (the Saturday Review) can be updated without harming its editorial integrity and it can continue to play an important role in contemporary American letters." 

   Paul Dietrich, the Review's publisher, declined comment. 

   The Review was founded in 1924. 
Its former, longtime editor, Norman Cousins, once said its mission was "to serve and strengthen the cultural marketplace of good taste. . . ." While magazines like Penthouse were succeeding, the Review was failing, and in the past five years it has had three owners and suspended publication three times. 
It is now a bimonthly, publishing half as often as it used to. 

   According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the Review's circulation slipped under 150,000 last year.
