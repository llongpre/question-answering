<DESCRIPT>  RESTAURANT; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN Restaurantspeak, "Middle Eastern" is the cuisine of a mythical kingdom
stretching from the Nile to Samarkand, where the native bread is flat, the
native meats skewered and the national vegetable the garbanzo.;    There's
some truth in that stereotype, of course. Any cuisine works with the local
materials and within a historical tradition of common borders, language or
conquest.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But what variations are possible within that tradition! There may be a
family resemblance between San Jose's new Persepolis restaurant and
Sunnyvale's 17-year-old Armenian Gourmet, but the differences are more
striking than the similarities, and more interesting.;    Armenian Gourmet
serves good, hearty food, decently prepared, with no surprises; mildly spiced,
it's geared to the American taste -- similar to and no more exotic than the
flavors and foodstuffs one would expect to find in, say, a decent Greek
restaurant.;    Redecorated pizzeria;  But Persepolis served up a number of
surprises, at least two of which -- a soup and a dessert -- were truly
memorable.;    Darius I made Persepolis (the Greek name means nothing more
than "Persian City") the capital of his empire more than five centuries before
Caligula.;    Persepolis the restaurant opened two months ago on Blossom Hill
Road, where Tehran native Mohammed Yousefzadeh put up white columns and
replaced his New York and Chicago Style Pizza with a quietly tasteful,
white-tablecloth restaurant. (The pizza place moved around the corner, same
building.);    The restaurant was nearly empty on a Saturday night (late
entertainment deters the crowds) when we spread our flatbread with
cucumber-yogurt mix with mint and torshi (both $3.45). The yogurt seemed more
like a condiment than an appetizer in itself -- I put some on my salad later
-- but it was a fine, fresh foil to the sour torshi, a potent mix of
cauliflower, carrots and eggplant, pickled and spiced up with a bit of chili.
(A somewhat more garlicky version also is available.);    What happened next
left me a trifle confused -- but I think the entrees at Persepolis come with a
salad, although the menu doesn't say so. Because I had ordered a Persepolis
salad ($4.45 for a big Greek-style salad of lettuce, cucumber, tomato,
cabbage, olives and feta cheese in an astringent vinaigrette), the waitress
brought me a cup of soup -- barley soup, made from what tasted like a
thickened chicken stock: mild, rich, soothing.;    Meanwhile, my companion had
ordered what the menu simply calls Persian Soup ($3.95). It turned out to be a
stunning melange of what Yousefzadeh says are imported Persian vegetables --
parsley, spinach, leeks, garbanzos and what I would have guessed were pinto
beans -- in its own stock, with noodles, dried mint and a drizzle of yogurt.
Extraordinary.;    Chicken with exuberant rice; My entree was another unusual
dish, and not at all what I expected. Called Shirin Polo ($8.45) on a list of
specials, it was not the chicken-and-rice dish I inferred from the description
but rather a rice dish with a couple of pieces of chicken on the side. The
chicken had simply been boiled with onions and spices, and removed well short
of the desiccated state achieved by soup chicken.;    The rice was something
else again. Deep yellow from saffron and suffused with sweet tang of candied
citrus, it was filled with bits of orange and tangerine peel, carrots, almonds
and pistachios. The chicken, tasting only of itself, was a useful counterpoint
to this exuberant rice.;    My companion, having disposed of her dinner salad
(a smaller version of the Persepolis salad), was served a plate of rice with a
light saffron dusting and a thin strip of charcoal-broiled filet mignon
($10.95), mildly marinated. It was good, but the surprise was that it wasn't
more interesting.;    Elderly aunts;  Our desserts were another story. One was
an excellent homemade ice cream made with pistachios ($2.75), sweet and very
creamy. The rosewater in the ice cream, elusive in the nose, exploded on the
palate. It was as though a gaggle of elderly aunts had surrounded us.;   
There was rosewater in my companion's dessert, too, but it was applied much
more judiciously. Faloudeh Shirazi ($2.25) is a marvelously refreshing
concoction of honey, lemon, sugar, water and rosewater, frozen, mixed with
bits of small, thin noodle and frozen again, and served with a squeeze of
lemon.;    Steakhouse was unsatisfying; Yousefzadeh is the son of an Iranian
restaurateur. Not a chef himself, he says he spends a lot of time in the
kitchen anyway. "I have a chef, but all the time I am working" is how he puts
it.;    Lebanese-born Armenian Gourmet owner Aram Janjigian became a chef when
he opened his restaurant. Before that, he had spent 10 years as a
front-of-the-house guy at Mr. Kelly's, a celebrated jazz, blues and steak
place on Chicago's Rush Street. He found it unsatisfying.;    Leaving Chicago
for his wife's native California, he broiled kebabs in a storefront on Duane
Avenue -- Dahlak, the East African restaurant, is there now -- before building
his own small, pink restaurant on the corner. His customers, drawn from
neighboring electronics firms, spill out onto the sidewalk at lunchtime. One
of them, a former AMD employee named John Michel, is immortalized on the menu;
he's a combination plate.;    Janjigian's desire to keep the customers
satisfied is not without its aesthetic drawbacks. "I have to be careful with
my garlic and my onions and my spices," he said when I complained that the
"Armenian steak tartar" ($8 as an appetizer, $12.50 as an entree) was kind of
bland. "It's geared more to the business community . . . to the American
taste." He adds bulgur to his tartar, omits the egg and serves the chopped
onions on the side.;    Armenian fajitas and pizza;  He had an interesting
suggestion: You take his dinner salad -- lettuce, feta, black olives -- and
roll it up in a round of pita bread, and put some steak tartar on top of it.
Sounds good to me.;    I had the John Michel special -- salty marinated lamb
kebabs, ground beef kebabs and some strips of lamb and beef sauteed with
onion, the whole thing served over rice -- and liked the saute best. It
reminded me of fajitas.;    There was an excellent appetizer of onions,
mushrooms, the garbanzo dip called hummos, tomatoes and green pepper, all
rolled in a pita round like a burrito. He calls it Lahmajun ($4), "stuffed
Armenian pizza." His baba ghanouj or roasted eggplant dip ($4) was a little
austere, but I liked the tabbuli, the bulgur salad with vegetables.;    One of
my companions ordered a meatless plate ($11.50), which consisted of tabuli,
baba ghanouj and a "cheese turnover" in phyllo dough. The other had a
combination plate ($13) of stuffed eggplant, nicely flavored stuffed grape
leaves and a turnover.;    Desserts? The cheesecake ($2.50) is store-bought
but pretty good. The baklava is homemade, crisp and not too stickily sweet. I
liked it, and I'm not a baklava fan.;  Armenian Gourmet; (star)(star) 1/2 To
