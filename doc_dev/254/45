   A federal appeals court, in a sweeping ruling that will help shield lenders from borrower lawsuits, overturned a record $129 million judgment against a McLean, Va., thrift and its Washington law firm. 

   The judgment, in favor of Penthouse magazine publisher Robert Guccione, had threatened the solvency of Dominion Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association and the law firm Melrod, Redman &amp; Gartlan. 

   Banks and other lenders in recent years have been hit with a wave of so-called lender liability suits, resulting in a series of huge awards. 
In many of the cases, juries or judges have disregarded the lengthy loan agreements that banks write to protect themselves and instead have focused on apparent bad-faith dealing by lenders, such as a derisive remark about good-faith dealing allegedly made by Dominion's chairman, William L. Walde, to a Penthouse adviser: "We're going to do it our way." 
Mr. Walde denied making the remark. 

   But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York gave great weight to the written terms of loan agreements, disparaged a theory of damages that borrowers' lawyers have used to win big judgments, and agreed with federal banking regulators that lender liability suits are a potential threat to the safety and soundness of the banking system. 

   Because there have been few appellate decisions to guide trial courts in this relatively new area of law, and because Second Circuit rulings are influential in business matters, the ruling is expected to have broad impact. 
Banking lawyers said the decision, issued late Friday, would help lenders defend themselves against lawsuits, and will make them less inclined to pay money to settle such suits. 

   "Bank counsel can take a lot of strength from this decision," said Richard F. Levy, a banking lawyer at Kirkland &amp; Ellis in Chicago. 
"It should not only discourage the filing of suits without merit, but should be read by judges throughout the country as requiring people to adhere to contracts they enter into." 

   Dominion Federal, not related to Dominion Bancshares Corp. in Roanoke, Va., has a net worth of just $72 million and couldn't have survived if the judgment were upheld. 

   The May 1987 trial verdict did serious damage to the thrift's reputation. 
In the following month, depositors withdrew about $125 million, said Richard S. Lawton, the S&amp;L's president, in an interview. 

   Officials of the Melrod law firm, which also had been held liable for the judgment, couldn't be reached for comment. 
Neither could Penthouse officials or lawyers. 

   The case grew out of Penthouse's efforts to build an Atlantic City casino. 
Dominion agreed to loan $35 million on the project. 
Penthouse charged that when Dominion had trouble finding other lenders to take part of its commitment, the S&amp;L schemed to delay the loan closing to get out of the commitment, acting in bad faith. 
Dominion denied this, and asserted it was merely taking precautions to protect itself from loss. 

   The Second Circuit panel ruled that much of Dominion's behavior that the trial court found shoddy occurred after the term of the loan agreement, and thus wasn't relevant. 

   The panel questioned the use of so-called lost profits to calculate damages. 
That theory, estimating how much Mr. Guccione would have made over ten years had the casino been built, accounted for about $112 million of the Penthouse verdict. 
The theory "may not be good law," the panel said. 

   The panel also said that "sound national banking policies support the conclusions we reach here." 
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates S&amp;Ls, filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Dominion.
