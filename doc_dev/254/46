   Pratt Hotel Corp. filed a civil
racketeering suit Monday against developer Donald Trump and
Penthouse magazine publisher Robert C. Guccione in a continuing
dispute over an unfinished casino project.
   Trump, Guccione and their corporate entities also were accused
of civil conspiracy, antitrust and fraud in the Superior Court
lawsuit filed by Pratt, which alleged Trump wanted the Penthouse
property to avoid increased competition for his rival Trump Plaza
Hotel and Casino.
   Pratt had a contract to purchase the incomplete Penthouse
project and convert it into the Sands Hollywood casino, but on
March 19 Trump made a surprise announcement that he purchased the
Penthouse site for $56 million and planned to convert it into a
non-casino hotel.
   Trump ``consistently and vehemently opposed the development of
the Sands Hollywood Casino Hotel project _ a competitor immediately
next door to Trump's major profitable asset in Atlantic City,''
Pratt said in a prepared statement.
   Pratt seeks to void Trump's contract with Guccione and force
Penthouse International Inc. to honor the Pratt contract. It also
asks for compensatory and punitive damages and asks that Trump's
casino license be revoked.
   Attorneys for the Pratt, Trump and Penthouse are scheduled to
appear at a conference before Superior Court Judge L. Anthony
Gibson on April 11.
   Pratt Hotel officials said Trump deliberately delayed the Sands
Hollywood project with legal challenges and attempts to purchase
parcels of land needed for the casino's parking facility.
   Pratt President William P. Weidner said Monday that Penthouse
violated the terms of its contract with Pratt by signing the deal
with Trump.
   ``Trump did everything he could _ both legally and illegally _
to ensure he did not have a competitor next door,'' said Roberto
Rivera-Soto, attorney for Pratt. ``And Guccione, through his
corporate entities, did everything he could to either have us
finance him or increase the value of his property at our expense.
   Trump on Monday referred calls to his Atlantic City attorney,
Patrick T. McGahn Jr., who said the Penthouse property was an open
target after Pratt's extended option to buy expired Feb. 1.
   ``It appears that the Sands and Pratt organizations may be
merely trying to cover up their own negligence and that of their
corporate officers and directors in failing to exercise the
option,'' McGahn said said.
   Penthouse International spokeswoman Leslie Jay said Monday the
company would have no comment until officials reviewed the lawsuit.
   In 1978, Penthouse bought the 392-room Holiday Inn on the
Boardwalk and the Four Seasons Motel on Pacific Avenue and
announced plans to link the two to create a casino hotel.
   A steel superstructure was put in place to link the two
buildings together, but construction stopped when Guccione ran out
of money.
   Trump has said he intends to demolish the rusting framework, but
refurbish the Holiday Inn facility into a non-casino hotel
connected to Trump Plaza. The back section of the Boardwalk
property at first would become parking space but a luxury hotel
would eventually be built on the site.
