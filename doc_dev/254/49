   A stripper performed explicit sexual acts for
Jimmy Swaggart while he was involved with a prostitute, Penthouse
magazine says, but the television evangelist's attorney called the
story a fabrication.
   Catherine Mary Kampen said Swaggart gained her trust as a
spiritual adviser, then emotionally manipulated her into acting out
his sexual fantasies, the magazine said in its March issue.
   ``The whole thing's made up,'' Swaggart attorney's Phillip A.
Wittman said Sunday.
   Wittman said Swaggart would file a libel lawsuit, probably this
week, against the men's magazine.
   ``Jimmy Swaggart doesn't even know Miss Kampen,'' said Wittman.
``He's never met her, never seen her.''
   Wittman said Swaggart was returning home to Baton Rouge from a
weekend crusade in Atlanta.
   According to Penthouse, Swaggart approached Kampen, a homemaker
and performer of striptease telegrams, at a roadside telephone in
July 1987.
   Kampen said Swaggart told her he could help her with her marriage
and personal life, and promised to help her financially while
demanding she perform sexual acts for him.
   Like Debra Murphree, the prostitute whose account Penthouse
published in July, Kampen claimed that Swaggart asked her to perform
explicit sex acts while he watched.
   Murphree said Swaggart wanted her 9-year-old daughter to watch
them have sex; Kampen said the evangelist asked to have sex with her
13-year-old daughter.
   Like Murphree, who said she was involved with Swaggart from
October 1986 until October 1987, Kampen claimed she posed for
Swaggart but kept her daughter away from him.
   Unlike Murphree, who said she and Swaggart attempted to have sex
one time, Kampen told the magazine she and Swaggart never had sex
during their six-month relationship.
   She said she asked him if he wanted to.
   ``And he said, `Oh sure, but that would be cheating. What we're
doing here is just playing _ it's fun and games, it's not cheating.
You understand that, don't you,''' Kampen quoted Swaggart as saying.
   Wittmann said his law firm conducted its own investigation of the
allegations after Penthouse asked about them more than a month ago.
   ``We advised Penthouse that in our view the story was a
fabrication, and we were under the impression that they were not
going to release the story,'' he said.
   ``They in fact had asked us for further information which we were
in the process of assembing for them,'' said Wittmann, adding that
he was shocked the story had been published.
   Last February, Swaggart confessed that he had sinned against his
church and his wife, but never gave specifics.
   Murphree has said Swaggart was talking about her, but Kampen said
she thought Swaggart was talking about her.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God in April because
he disobeyed the Pentecostal denomination's order that he not preach
for a year and returned to the pulpit three months later.
