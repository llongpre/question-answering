   Actor Don Johnson, recently reunited with
ex-wife, Melanie Griffith, says there are no hard feelings between
his girlfriends past and present _ in fact, they're as close as kin.
   ``We all consider each other family,'' Johnson said in April's
Fame magazine. ``Patti (D'Arbanville)'s part of the family. Miss
Pamela (Des Barres) is part of the family. Barbra (Streisand) is
part of the family.''
   Johnson and D'Arbanville have a son, Jesse, and he had highly
publicized romances with Des Barres and Streisand.
   Griffith and Johnson are expecting a child and have announced
plans to remarry.
   The actor shares similar familial feelings toward the cast and
staff of ``Miami Vice,'' the show that propelled him to stardom.
   ``We've all grown together. And I'm going to miss them,'' said
Johnson. ``I'm gonna miss the whole experience, whenever it does
end. These guys have stood by me in some very rough times.''

   Penthouse magazine publisher Bob Guccione
testified that a former ``Pet of the Year'' who is suing him for $10
million was a potential Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a
life of crime.
   Guccione said Tuesday that Anneka DiLorenzo, who alleges breach
of contract, sexual harassment and fraud, approached him at age 20,
eager to pose nude for Penthouse after seeing the publisher on a
talk show.
   Ms. DiLorenzo, whose real name is Marjorie Thoreson, was signed
to his company's first management contract in 1974, Guccione said.
She became the magazine's 1975-76 ``Pet of the Year.''
   Guccione cast her in his sexually explicit movie ``Caligula,''
which Ms. DiLorenzo now says was a pornographic film that ruined her
career. For Ms. DiLorenzo's role, Guccione paid for surgery to have
her breasts enlarged.
   ``I thought it was a leg up on prostitution in Las Vegas,
stealing cars, writing bum checks and building up a life of crime,''
Guccione testified. He said he cast her in the movie because
sexually she was ``extremely adroit'' and ``perfect for the part.''
   Guccione cited three actresses who appeared nude early in their
careers and became cinema sex symbols _ Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte
Bardot and Hedy Lamarr.
   ``I felt Anneka could emerge as the sex symbol of her time,'' he
said.
   Ms. DiLorenzo's lawyer, Murray Schwartz, told state Judge Elliott
Wilk that Guccione ``is probably one of the leading pornographers in
the United States.''

   Pope John Paul II, an outdoor enthusiast, went skiing
in the Apennine mountains in central Italy, state television
reported.
   The RAI network reported that the pontiff, who hiked and went
skiing frequently in his youth in Poland, took to the slopes Tuesday
at Campo Felice, a popular ski area 1{-hours from Rome.
   Two years ago, the pope took a few runs in the Apennines at the
winter resort of Ovindoli. In July 1984, he went skiing with
then-President Sandro Pertini near Trento in the northern Dolomite
mountains.

   Pop star Michael Jackson, a circus
fan, is going to the big top today and taking 200 disadvantaged
children with him, a spokesman said.
   Jackson wanted to extend a friendly hand to his new neighbors,
publicist Lee Solters said Tuesday.
   Jackson moved about a year ago to a 2,700-acre ranch in the
nearby Santa Ynez Valley, where he has room for his menagerie of
monkeys, llamas, snakes, birds and barnyard animals.
   His special guests for Circus Vargas will include students from
St. Vincent's Home for Dysfunctional Children and kids from the
local Big Brothers and Big Sisters program, which provides emotional
support to children of low-income, single-parent families.

   Sentencing for Cher's boyfriend was postponed
because of a dispute over where he should perform community service
for smashing a photographer's camera.
   Municipal Court Judge Ronald Schoenberg indicated he will order
Rob Camilletti, 24, to pay $1,050 in fines, make restitution, do 300
hours of community service and serve 24 months probation, said City
Attorney's Office spokesman Mike Qualls.
   Schoenberg reset sentencing for April 4 after meeting Tuesday
with Deputy City Attorney Renee Laurents and defense lawyer John
Forbes. Ms. Laurents said the defense wants Camilletti to perform
community service in New York, where he lives.
   Camilletti pleaded no contest Feb. 28 to two counts of vandalism.
He was accused of trying to run down free-lance photographer Peter
Brandt with his Ferrari and smashing his camera outside Cher's home
Benedict Canyon home last July.
   Cher, 42, and Camilletti, a former bagel maker, pizza chef and
bartender, have been companions since meeting at a New York
nightclub on her 40th birthday.

   Longtime James Bond star Roger Moore said it wasn't
just fears about his baritone voice that led him to give up a
leading role in the latest Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.
   ``Actually, I think the voice would have stood up,'' Moore said
Tuesday in a BBC radio interview. ``It's just the whole technical
thing that would not have. It was a question of counting time and
when to come in and go out and finding those notes out of the air.''
   Moore had been rehearsing six weeks for the part of suave and
dashing George Dillingham in ``Aspects of Love,'' which opens next
month.
   ``I have had awful nightmares, really terrible,'' the 61-year-old
actor said.
   His replacement has not been announced, but Albert Finney and
Denis Quilley had been mentioned for the part.
