<HEAD>Penthouse Publisher's N.J. Casino Suit Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court today killed Penthouse
magazine publisher Robert Guccione's $400 million lawsuit against
the federal government in connection with the FBI's Abscam
investigation.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
Guccione's suit.
   In Abscam, a highly publicized ``sting'' operation in the late
1970s, FBI agents posed as representatives of phony Arab sheiks
looking for investment opportunities.
   A key figure in the operation was Melvin Weinberg, a con man
turned FBI informant and middleman.
   Guccione said Weinberg promised him that the bogus sheiks would
finance an Atlantic City, N.J., casino if Guccione would take part
in bribing New Jersey officials to obtain a casino license.
   The magazine publisher said he refused to go along, and Weinberg
then spread rumors that Guccione had financial problems and was
connected to organized crime figures.
   As a result, the suit said, Guccione was unable to secure
legitimate financing for a casino from 1979 to 1983.
   A 1983 Senate report criticized the FBI for its handling of
Weinberg. The report said the Guccione episode is ``a chilling
reminder of the risks imposed by lax procedures and inadequate
supervision of an informant like Weinberg.''
   Guccione's suit accused federal officials of negligently
supervising Weinberg.
   The government enjoys broad immunity from being sued, but under
the Federal Tort Claim Act has surrendered some of that protection.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May upheld a judge's
ruling that threw out the suit, ruling that the federal law does
not permit Guccione to sue.
   ``The United States is not liable for the intentional (injuries
caused by) those carrying out its business, even though (Guccione)
alleges a claim of primary negligence on the part of the United
States in failing to supervise or otherwise avoid foreseeable
risks,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Guccione vs. U.S., 89-553.
