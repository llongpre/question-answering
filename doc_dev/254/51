   A Louisiana stripper had a six-month sexual
relationship with evangelist Jimmy Swaggart at the same time he
allegedly was involved with a prostitute, a men's magazine reported.
   Penthouse magazine, in its March issue, said Swaggart sought out
Catherine Mary Kampen, a homemaker and performer of striptease
telegrams, promising to help her financially while demanding she
perform sexual acts for him.
   Swaggart's attorneys told the magazine Kampen's allegations were
untrue and that she fabricated the account. Phillip A. Wittmann, an
attorney for Swaggart, said the evangelist will sue Penthouse.
   The magazine said Swaggart approached Kampen at a roadside
telephone in July 1987 and said he could help her with her marriage
and personal life.
   Kampen told the magazine that she and Swaggart never had sexual
intercourse during the course of their relationship.
   She told Penthouse she wondered if Swaggart wanted to have
intercourse with her, so she asked him.
   ``And he said, `Oh sure, but that would be cheating. What we're
doing here is just playing _ it's fun and games, it's not cheating.
You understand that, don't you,''' Kampen quoted Swaggart as saying.
   Over the course of their relationship she said Swaggart:
   _Made her perform explicit sex acts while he watched, an
allegation also made about him by a prostitute, Debra Murphree, whom
Swaggart allegedly was seeing at the same time.
   _Requested sex with Kampen's 13-year-old daughter, but Kampen
refused.
   Swaggart confessed on the air in February 1988 that he had
``sinned.''
   Kampen said in the Penthouse article she thought he was talking
about her, but Murphree said he was referring to her. Swaggart's
alleged liaison with Murphree was uncovered by a rival evangelist.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God in April 1988
because he disobeyed the Pentecostal denomination's order that he
not preach for a year and returned to the pulpit three months later.
