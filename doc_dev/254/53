Penthouse Publisher Bob Guccione said today that he is planning to sell his 
magazine in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Guccione said he has reached agreement with Moscow to start distributing the 
magazine in the Soviet Union within the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also has plans to distribute it in Poland, Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
He said some high-ranking Soviet officials have private subscriptions, part of 
Penthouse's worldwide sales of nearly 4 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Five of the 17 bureaucrats I spoke to when I was negotiating with the Soviet 
ministry told me that they get it every month," said Guccione, who's in 
Australia to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the magazine's Australian 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought in light of perestroika the Russian male was likely to benefit 
from a lifestyle magazine like Penthouse. I naturally agreed with that."
