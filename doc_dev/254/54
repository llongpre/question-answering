<LEADPARA>  The "other woman" in the alleged Kennedy rape investigation says she's had it
with fame, but she attracted more attention this week in scuffles with a
television reporter and her roommate.;    Michele Cassone, 27, was at the
Kennedy estate over the Easter weekend when another woman said she was raped
by William Kennedy Smith. Smith, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's nephew, has denied
the allegations.  </LEADPARA>

AT KENNEDY ESTATE, SHE'S HAD IT WITH FAME  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Cassone has said she saw no evidence of a rape.;    Since then, Cassone
says she has been besieged by reporters and television crews seeking her
account of what happened early in the morning of March 30.;    The Fox
network's show "A Current Affair" paid Cassone $1,000 for a Tuesday interview,
said reporter Steve Dunleavy.;    Nude photographs;  With the cameras rolling,
Cassone got into a biting, kicking struggle with Dunleavy after he produced
photographs he said showed her naked and having sex at a beach party.;   
Early Wednesday, police were called to her apartment to break up a fight
between Cassone and her roommate, Gaynor Gwynne, the daughter of actor Fred
Gwynne who starred in the television show "The Munsters.";    "I'm getting new
tires on my car and driving," she said later Wednesday from her Palm Beach
apartment. "Every time I say or do something, it gets in the paper.";    "My
life has become a nightmare," she said in the television interview broadcast
Wednesday. "Everywhere I go, people are abusing me. Reporters. TV people.
Everybody wants to hear what I have to say.";    Penthouse denies reports; 
Dunleavy asked Cassone about reports that she planned to pose nude for
Penthouse magazine. Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione denied the reports
Wednesday.;    "Anybody who knows me knows I am not that type of person,"
Cassone said. "I will not pose nude for anyone.";    Dunleavy then produced
the photographs.;    Giggling and blinking, Cassone asked several times,
"Where did you get those?" She struggled with Dunleavy to get the pictures
from him.;    Dunleavy said he got the pictures from a man in two of the
shots. They were "not purloined and not purchased," he said.  </TEXT>
