   Penthouse magazine publisher Bob
Guccione may buy a $12 million Boardwalk tract where a casino hotel
was once proposed, a state appeals court has ruled.
   The decision Thursday was the latest ruling in nine years of
protracted litigation over the site where the Mayflower Hotel once
stood.
   Guccione became embroiled in a lawsuit with Greta and Joseph
Shamy, who were under contract to buy the hotel in 1977, according
to court papers.
   The Shamys, of Galloway Township, and Guccione had agreed to form
a corporation to buy the property and develop a new casino hotel.
But the Shamys sued for breach of contract in 1979 following a
business dispute.
   Seven years later, after numerous court hearings, a Superior
Court judge ordered the property placed in receivership and sold to
a competitive bidder.
   Guccione's attorney, Henry N. Luter of Morristown, said Guccione
and an investment group put together by the Shamys made separate
offers.
   The court-appointed receiver, Arthur M. Greenbaum, recommended
that the property be sold to Guccione for $12 million, the amount he
had already invested in the property, according to court papers. The
Shamys appealed that recommendation.
   But in a decision released Thursday, Judges Herman D. Michels and
John D. Keefe of the Appellate Division of Superior Court affirmed
the receiver's recommendation.
