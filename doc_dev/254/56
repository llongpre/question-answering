   A prostitute claims she and television
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart had sexual intercourse and he wanted her
9-year-old daughter to watch sex acts but she refused, Penthouse
magazine reports.
   The article in the July issue is the first to report that
Swaggart engaged in sexual intercourse during any of the alleged
sexual encounters that led to his removal from the pulpit by the
Assemblies of God church April 8.
   In previous reports, the prostitute, Debra Murphree, said
Swaggart paid her to perform lewd acts while he watched in a New
Orleans area motel last year.
   Swaggart, head of the Baton Rouge-based Jimmy Swaggart World
Ministries, stopped preaching for three months but returned to the
pulpit Sunday without credentials from the Assemblies, the nation's
largest Pentecostal denomination.
   The Penthouse interview is accompanied by explicit photos in
which Murphree demonstrates the acts she said Swaggart asked her to
perform.
   She said she had at least 20 encounters with him during a
one-year period.
   The issue containing the article is scheduled to go on sale in
June, but some copies were sold here Tuesday.
   Swaggart has never admitted a sexual encounter, but said from
the pulpit Feb. 1 that he was guilty of a sin against his family.
   William Treeby, an attorney for the ministries, refused to
comment on the Penthouse article.
   ``We will have no comment about that ever,'' Treeby said.
   In April, The National Enquirer supermarket tabloid decided not
to use an interview with Murphree after she failed a lie detector
test about her allegations. She blamed the polygraph results on her
use of cocaine the day before the test was administered.
   Penthouse planned to pay the 28-year-old Murphree for the
interview and pictures, but Leslie Jay, the magazine's director of
public relations, would not disclose the amount.
   In the article, Murphree claimed that she and Swaggart had brief
sexual intercourse once, and that she performed oral sex on
Swaggart more than once.
   She said Swaggart was unwilling most times to pay her the going
rate of ``$30 or $40'' for oral sex.
   ``God, what a freak! Kinky! Here he is up there preaching for
all this money, and when I see him, he's kinky and cheap, too,''
she said.
   She said she refused Swaggart's request that she have her
9-year-old daughter watch sex acts.
   ``I said, `You can do whatever turns you on but don't ever
mention my daughter again,' '' the magazine quoted her as saying.
   Murphree has three children living with her parents in Indiana.
She has an arrest record in Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana,
mainly involving prostitution charges.
