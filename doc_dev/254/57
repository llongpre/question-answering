   A model has filed a $480,000 lawsuit against
former New York Jets football star Mark Gastineau, claiming he broke
promises and lied to her during their three-year relationship.
   Jodee Dominici of Phoenix claims in the suit filed Thursday in
Maricopa County Superior Court that Gastineau, whom she met in
February 1985, talked her into quitting her modeling job to help
manage his business and personal affairs.
   Ms. Dominici, who appeared on the television show ``Star Search''
in October 1985, says Gastineau told her he was single when he
actually was married and failed to tell her about his marital status
until they had dated about a month. The suit says Ms. Dominici was
18 years old at the time.
   It also claims Gastineau took $12,000 she received in personal
injury settlements and never returned it to her.
   Gastineau and Ms. Dominici ended their relationship in January
1988 when Gastineau began seeing actress Brigitte Nielsen. Gastineau
resigned from the Jets last month after Ms. Nielsen said she had
cancer of the uterus.
   A biopsy last week showed Ms. Nielsen did not have cancer but had
dysplasia, a cellular irregularity, that was treated with
cryosurgery.
   Gastineau, who reportedly has been living in his boyhood home in
eastern Arizona, did not immediately return phone calls from The
Associated Press.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca assembled
his company's board of directors here to visit the new Diamond-Star
Motors Corp. auto assembly plant, but the trip wasn't all business.
   Iacocca took time from the monthly board meeting Wednesday to
take a spin in a couple of new Plymouth Lasers around Diamond-Star's
test track.
   ``He was very excited,'' said G. Glenn Gardner, chairman of
Diamond-Star, a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. of Japan. ``He took out a couple different cars and really
enjoyed it.''
   Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald Greenwald and some of the 21
other board members also had some fun test-driving new Lasers, said
Robin Skiles, a Diamond-Star spokeswoman.
   ``They were really whipping around the test track,'' she said.
``They are like new toys to them.''
   Iacocca is scheduled to drive the first car off the assembly line
at the plant's formal opening ceremony next week. The plant also
produces the Mitsubishi Eclipse.

   Veteran actor Sir Alec Guinness has returned to the
London stage for the first time in a decade.
   Guinness, 74, appeared in Thursday night's opening of ``A Walk in
the Woods,'' by American writer Lee Blessing, playing a Soviet arms
negotiator coming to terms with nuclear weapons. The play closed on
Broadway in New York earlier this year.
   Most of Guinness' recent work has been in films and television.
   He last appeared in a London theater in Alan Bennett's ``The Old
Country'' in 1977-78.
   In 1984, he was Shylock in William Shakespeare's ``The Merchant
of Venice'' at Chichester, 70 miles southwest of London.

   Singer-songwriter Van Stephenson claims
in a lawsuit that Penthouse Forum magazine made him look like a
sexual deviant by using one of his album covers to illustrate an
article about transvestites.
   Stephenson, who lives nearby in Williamson County, contends in
the U.S. District Court suit filed this week that the magazine
invaded his privacy and defamed his character.
   The suit seeks $500,000 in damages. Among those named as
defendants are Forum International Ltd., the magazine's publisher;
Bob Guccione, the magazine's chief executive officer; and MCA
Records, which released Stephenson's album.
   Penthouse publicist Leslie Jay said she had not seen the lawsuit
and could not comment. MCA officials did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   The photo shows Stephenson's face with an agonized expression
superimposed on a woman's back. It was the cover for his 1984 album
``Righteous Anger.''
   Stephenson's songs include ``Your Kisses Will,'' recorded by
Crystal Gayle, and ``China Girl,'' recorded by John Cougar
Mellencamp.

   Jeremy Thomas, the British producer of the
Oscar-winning movie ``The Last Emperor,'' says he was forced to seek
investment abroad for his new films after investors from his own
country refused to fund him again.
   ``It's a great shame that British banks would not back us this
time,'' said the 39-year-old producer. ``A lot of money for `The
Last Emperor' came from British institutions and they all got their
money back.''
   He told reporters Thursday he raised $120 million in Japan and
Europe for his next six movies, a sum he claimed was a record for an
independent British producer.
   The first movie, ``Everybody Wins,'' will be based on a
screenplay by American playwright Arthur Miller, whose last film
script was for the 1961 classic ``The Misfits,'' starring Marilyn
Monroe and Clark Gable.
   ``Everybody Wins,'' which is to be shot in Connecticut and North
Carolina in January, will be directed by Briton Karel Reisz and
feature American stars Nick Nolte and Debra Winger, said Thomas.
   Thomas said the other films he will be making as part of his
package over the next four years include ``The Naked Lunch,''
scripted by William Burroughs from his book of the same title, and
``King of the Cannibals,'' based on a Herman Melville novel.
