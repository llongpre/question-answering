   NEW YORK -- General Media International Inc., which
publishes magazines including Penthouse, Omni and Longevity,
said it is dismissing 18% of its 650-member staff, effective
immediately.
   The unexpected announcement of 120 firings contradicts the
upbeat picture that closely held General Media consistently
puts forward. General Media Chairman Bob Guccione has been on
a spending spree in the past year, buying magazines aimed at
car enthusiasts and personal-computer users.

   In an interview, Mr. Guccione said the company cut back
despite the fact that all its magazines remain profitable.
"But we were heavily overstaffed," he said. "We had a lot of
departments that were overgrown with flab."
   Yesterday's dismissals affected virtually every magazine
owned by General Media and didn't include the unannounced
dismissals of about 20 free-lance contributors.
   General Media said it would consolidate staffs of Omni, a
science magazine, with the staff of Compute, a computer
magazine it acquired in April 1990 from Capital Cities/ABC
Inc. Omni's editorial operations, headquartered in New York,
will relocate to Compute's headquarters in Greensboro, N.C.
   Mr. Guccione said Omni and Compute would expand
editorially, beginning in February, with 16-page sections
common to both magazines that would carry no advertising, at
least initially.
   According to one Penthouse staff member, who didn't want
to be identified, the atmosphere at General Media's Manhattan
office was "hellish. . . . People were waiting for the ax to
fall. It's black Monday around here."
   General Media made an attempt to accentuate the positive.
Its news release concerning staff reductions included a trade
publication article highlighting the strength of General
Media's ad pages.
