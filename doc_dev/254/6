or 'grosses legumes', as the French say - on the Paris stage are a Briton
rewriting a French opera, an Egyptian making a film show on the sacred
boards of the Comedie Francaise, and an American directing German actors in
a language they have never spoken before.
Peter Brook's Impressions of Pelleas, Yossif Chahine's Caligula and Bob
Wilson's Dr Faustus are stamped with the vision of three of Europe's
greatest directors. In all, multi-cultural strangeness and splendour
intoxicates, hints at shifting perspectives, changing realities. In Faustus,
three actors simultaneously play the hero; Pelleas has different actresses -
Chinese, Japanese, Korean - as the heroine on consecutive nights. It is
drama as haphazardly personal, fluid, unfixed. It is also highly stylised,
presenting a deliberately unreal imaginative world.
Here is the director as star: after 30 seconds you see at once Wilson's
hallmark - cold artifice - or Brook's mix of the exotic and intimately
simple. Drama, with its demand that the director realise his own view of a
play, has always been a deconstructionist's paradise. But among Europe's
theatre pioneers, we now see a late 20th century trend which parallels
post-modern developments in other arts.
One feature is a move away from the straight play to a collage of devices -
mime, acrobatics, dance, rock, film. Mostly these imposed stylisations - the
pleasure lies in the aesthetic pattern, unity of music, movement, design,
not in story or naturalistic character. A director such as Chahine makes
political points this way; others, such as Wilson, are aesthetes offering no
meaning beyond the stage. All are part of a post-modern trend in which
language is no longer the main route to meaning; dramatic impetus is not
verbal but visual, physical, spiritual.
Multi-culturalism is at the core of this phenomenon in Europe. It embodies
relativity of meaning, and it liberates directors from traditional texts and
conventional staging. It is no chance that the explorers are multi-lingual:
Brook, Wilson, Chahine, Ruth Berghaus, Peter Zadek, Luc Bondy may work in
French, German, English. The most exciting shows in Europe are translations,
radical revisions - Brook chops Debussy's opera in half and plays it with
just a piano - or works which barely have a text. All reflects a sense of
fragmentation throughout politics and culture.
Brook's Paris Tempest, with magic, acrobatics, an Indian Prospero, a black
Ariel, showed how translation turned Shakespeare 'into something rich and
strange'. For Pelleas the cavernous Bouffes du Nord venue is a fin-de-siecle
bourgeois interior with Persian carpets, Chinese vases and Japanese screens.
Fixing the oppressive mood of Maeterlinck's play the oriental actresses
playing Melisande are women from another milieu; the acting, trembling,
precise, understated, recalls the Tempest; gestures, eyes looking away
suggest souls - Prospero, Pelleas - lost in themselves. The essential is
unexpressed but subtly evoked - perfect for Maeterlinck's symbolist theatre
of silence, and for Brook's vision of intimacy and foreboding.
Where Brook has exoticism, Wilson has an abstract finesse at once
sophisticated and naive. His surrealism owes a debt to Tadeusz Kantor, whose
apocalyptic view of history as a cacophony of mass terror is enacted by
black and white ghost-figures miming or jerking into action as in early
movies to the jangle of guns, machines or folk music; there is no text.
Kantor's great Krakow show, Today's My Birthday, still tours Europe. It
echoes in Wilson's masterpiece, The Black Rider and in the weaker Dr
Faustus.
Wilson's figures, chalky faced, eyes blackened, move in irregular jumps. The
motif is cold angularity - crooked chairs six feet high, trees as scissor
cut-outs, costumes with jagged edges, a red stiletto heel jutting from a
slit in a box. Music, mime, dance, starts and stops abruptly. But it is also
an enticing nursery rhyme world: pink neon, a big pulpy moon; the devil in
Faustus, the lovers in The Black Rider, float upstage on swings.
The limit of language is Wilson's obsession. In the 'spoken opera' Faustus,
a German cast who first had to learn English, chant monosyllabic verse as
parrot grammar, maddeningly meaningless. In Wilson's new show, a musical
Alice in Wonderland, 'a word means just what I choose it to mean'. For The
Black Rider William Burroughs' banal German-English ballads match the
fairground kitsch of Tom Waits' tunes. It is art for art's sake, but
Wilson's brittle-cruel-romantic collages work because they dramatise love,
death, in a brilliantly realised, unified imagery.
Only Ruth Berghaus equals Wilson's intense abstraction. Her Hamburg Jungle
of Cities is a Brecht collectors item, a mechanised choreographic nightmare
where words hardly matter. A criss-cross of railway lines is backed by a
silhouette of skyscrapers; people enter via windows, fall into pits, as a
huge tent moves menacingly across the stage to devour all: a surreal
updating of Brecht's alienation effect.
The cityscape is the theatrical image of our time. Most influential has been
Peter Zadek's in his Vienna Merchant of Venice, relocated to Wall Street as
a satire on yuppies and a parable of survival in a brash society. The set
parodies post-modern architecture - a Richard Rodgers dream bank of steel
tubes, glass frames, mirrored panels rises to the loft of the stage - and
has sent deconstructionist echoes through many productions. The giant
lift-mirror in Bondy's Berlin Final Chorus, for example, reflects both the
mad looking glass world of bourgeois society and the audiences reaction to
it.
Chahine's Caligula is the pinnacle of this style. A huge tower block is also
a screen projecting a modern city, moving crowds, Caligula magnified as a
crazed dictator. At the end, this terrific structure disintegrates in
flames, casting out changing images, different in each part of the
auditorium. It suggests how random is our vision - sideshows range from Arab
tambourinists to punk acrobats - and how we distance terror as it is
stylised by televisual repetition.
Caligula wittily and vibrantly uses non-traditional theatre forms to
deconstruct our culture; the set is an emblem of the theme. It pinpoints a
new visual, physical drama which should spread further this decade. Since
European theatre thrives on cultural exchange, and language is of secondary
importance, it is to be hoped that more such pieces - only Pelleas is
planned for Glasgow - will visit Britain.
