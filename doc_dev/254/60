   The ongoing legal battle between
Donald Trump and the Pratt Hotel Corp. over rights to develop the
abandoned Penthouse casino site is again focusing on whether the
billionaire developer owns too much property here.
   The latest chapter in the courtroom fight occurred Monday before
Superior Court Judge L. Anthony Gibson, who heard arguments on
whether his court or state gaming regulators should hear antitrust
complaints filed against Trump.
   In 1988, the Dallas-based Pratt Hotel Corp. announced plans to
build the Sands Hollywood casino at the Boardwalk site of the
defunct Penthouse casino project. But when Pratt's development
agreement expired in December, Trump stepped in and bought the site
for a luxury non-casino hotel.
   In April, Pratt sued Trump in Superior Court, asking the court to
void Trump's contract with Penthouse publisher Robert C. Guccione.
Among the complaints, Trump, Guccione and their corporate entitities
were charged with civil conspiracy, antitrust, fraud and engaging in
a pattern of racketeering activity.
   Monday's hearing focused on whether four counts in Pratt's
complaint against Trump _ which charge him with violating the New
Jersey Antitrust Act _ should be heard by the court or the state
Casino Control Commission.
   Gibson extended the hearing until July 18. But in 1{ hours, he
heard arguments from attorneys for Trump, Pratt and Penthouse.
   Penthouse attorney Paul A. Rowe argued that the Casino Control
Commission, in approving Trump's recent purchase of Elsinore's
Atlantic Casino Hotel, found that Trump has not created a monopoly
in Atlantic City.
   Because the casino commission has already explored the subject of
economic concentration, Gibson would only be duplicating efforts,
Rowe said.
   But Pratt attorney Arnold Calmann said, ``Trump and Penthouse are
arguing to the court that the Casino Control Act divests and
eliminates the jurisdiction of a New Jersey court to hear antitrust
claims brought under the New Jersey antitrust act. There is no law
to support that.''
   In 1978, Penthouse bought the Holiday Inn on the Boardwalk and
the Four Seasons Motel on Pacific Avenue and announced plans to link
the two to create a casino hotel.
   A steel superstructure was put in place to join the two
buildings, but construction stopped when Guccione ran out of money.
   Trump has said he intends to demolish the rusting framework, but
refurbish the Holiday Inn site into a non-casino hotel connected to
Trump Plaza. The back section of the Boardwalk property would become
parking space for now, he said, but a luxury hotel would eventually
be built on the site.
