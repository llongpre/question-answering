   A former pre-school teacher was convicted
Friday of sexually assaulting 19 children and endangering the
welfare of a 20th child at a now-defunct day care center.
   Margaret Kelly Michaels, 26, of Pittsburgh, was found guilty of
115 counts and acquitted on 16.
   Parents of the youngsters cried, as did Ms. Michaels, while the
jury read its verdict concluding a 10-month trial and 13 days of
deliberations.
   Superior Judge William F. Harth revoked Ms. Michaels' $25,000
bail and ordered her jailed pending sentencing May 26. Ms. Michaels
could be sentenced to more than 1,000 years in prison and fined
more than $3 million.
   Defense attorneys Harvey Meltzer and Robert Clark said only that
they will appeal.
   Ms. Michaels was accused of sexually abusing, terrorizing and
endangering the children, ages 3 to 5, between October 1984, when
she was hired, and April 1985, when she resigned from the Wee Care
Day Nursery in Maplewood.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Michaels engaged in nude sex play with the
children, including nude pileups, performed sex acts on them with
kitchen utensils, played the piano in the nude and forced the
toddlers to perform sex acts on her.
   The charges ranged from aggravated sexual assault to endangering
the welfare of a child.
   Eighteen children testified by videotape, a 19th child testified
by audio tape, and the father of a 20th child who did not testify
was called to the stand.
   Ms. Michaels testified she could not have abused the children
because of the presence of other teachers and time constraints. The
defense had said there were inconsistencies in the children's
testimony and that they were coached on what to say.
   Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Sara Senser McArdle hugged and
kissed the parents of the children. ``Justice has been served, but
this is not a happy day,'' she told one mother.
   At a news conference, Ms. McArdle said the investigation and
trial were difficult because ``we had extremely traumatized
children ... who felt guilty'' that they had participated in sexual
acts.
   One mother, whose 8-year-old daughter was among the victims,
said of Ms. Michaels: ``I'm sorry for her. But I hate her for what
she did to the children.''
