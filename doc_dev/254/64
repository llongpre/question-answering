   In the April 3 Who's-News-page profile of lawyer Norman Roy Grutman, who represents both Jerry Falwell and Penthouse magazine, Ed Bean writes that "Mr. 
Grutman's personal life style falls more toward the Falwell end of the spectrum than the Guccione one. . . . 
The lawyer says he doesn't smoke, drink, go to nightclubs or 'chase after women.'" 

   This presupposes that I participate in the above activities. 
On the contrary, I do not smoke, drink, gamble, go to nightclubs, use drugs or "chase after women."
