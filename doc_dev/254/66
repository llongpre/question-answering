   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, struggling
amid charges of sexual misconduct, said Sunday that his television
ministry lost $1.5 million in January and still needs an influx of
donations to stay on the air.
   Swaggart, who declared war on ``pornographers'' he said are
trying to destroy his ministry, said last week that he would be off
the air after Feb. 26 unless supporters provided enough money.
   During his weekly TV program shown Sunday, Swaggart said
followers had responded to the plea but that more donations were
needed to continue the broadcast to all areas.
   ``On Feb. 26, if we do not continue to receive support, we will
lose some stations,'' he said.
   Although Swaggart did not reveal how much money had been
received, he said the ministry posted a $1.5 million loss in
January, a month he said is traditionally the worst month for
television evangelists.
   Last month, Penthouse magazine quoted a New Orleans
``strip-o-gram'' dancer as saying she posed nude for Swaggart, a
charge that he labeled Sunday as ``a scam, a lie from A to Z.''
   Catherine Mary Kampen's story is similar to that of a New Orleans
prostitute who said Swaggart paid her to pose nude for him, an
allegation that led to Swaggart's ouster from the Assemblies of God
and a sharp downturn in the fortunes of his ministry.
   On Feb. 21, 1988, Swaggart made a tearful confession to an
unspecified sin from the pulpit of his Baton Rouge church.
   ``I am not discounting any sin or mistake that Jimmy Swaggart has
committed or made,'' he said during Sunday's program. ``So, please
understand that. I have stood up as possibly no man in history has
ever stood up and blamed no one but myself before the whole wide
world.''
   ``But if Satan succeeds in getting you to zero in on that, and
that's all you see, then he will succeed,'' Swaggart said.
   Swaggart repeated his charge that Penthouse published the story
even though it had been given evidence that Kampen's story was
false. Penthouse has said it stands by the story. Swaggart's
attorneys have said a libel suit is being prepared.
