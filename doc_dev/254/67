<LEADPARA>  THEIR CAREER BEGAN in 1967: San Francisco flower children were preaching peace
and love, Artie had left the military reserve, and Jim was majoring in
political science at San Francisco State, with a minor in film. Legend has it
the Mitchells watched a blue movie at a stag party one night and one brother
(no one remembers which) said, "Hey, bub, an ol' boy could make himself a lot
of money with these movies." Jim and Artie brought an 8mm camera to the beach
one day and, according to Jim, one of them (probably Artie) approached a young
girl and said "How about taking your blouse off?" Jim was earning $1.25 an
hour as a doorman at the Follies in San Francisco's Mission District. He sold
them a soft-core "loop" for $100 -- reportedly netting $6. "We didn't know
much about filmmaking, still don't," Jim once told a classroom of sexology
students. "Those were the days of Haight-Ashbury. The biggest complaint was
the girls had dirty feet.";    "The very first film we did, I wasn't planning
on being in the film, but the male star didn't show up," Artie told the
students. "So, I mean, at that point, I'd written a script and toiled over it
for hours. It was about two pages. We were trying to shoot soft-core, (but)
the lady and I got so carried away, immediately it turned into a hard-core
film."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Artie confessed that legal pressures "forced" them to write plots and make
feature-length, hard-core skin flicks. "We were enjoying making 20-minute
loops, we thought they were hot and selling well. Then we lost (an obscenity)
trial on a loop. And the attorney, Mike Kennedy, says 'Hey, you guys outta
start making features.' So, we go, all right." Jim added that the two were
busted for hard-core obscenity in the early days, even though the actresses
were partially clad. "We said to each other, 'Hey, they're taking us to trial
or court, we might as well be making hard-core movies. S--t, that's a charge.
Let's do it.' We did it, the box office went up and that helped us defray the
expenses of fighting it.";    It proved to be a successful formula. Artie was
the zany director and male stand-in; Jim was the money man. For a while, they
couldn't miss. It was the golden age of erotic film. They had chosen a hip
career path that allowed them to become advocates of free love and to profit
from the sexual revolution. They opened the O'Farrell Theatre on Independence
Day 1969, so they could have a place to show their increasingly harder-core
movies.;    Perhaps the secret of their commercial success was the bourgeois
idea of adding a plot to a porn flick. In 1971, they met a fresh-faced model,
Marilyn Chambers, previously seen on boxes of Ivory Snow, and cast her in the
most expensive porn feature yet made, Behind the Green Door.;    Boldly
hard-core yet wickedly creative, it cost $60,000 to make, and eventually
grossed more than $25 million.;    Jim's college film instructor, Jim Goldner,
said that when they began, "They were moving in the direction of legitimizing
sex as a part of filmmaking, just as it was in literature. The films were many
notches above the kind of stag films that the Elks Clubs and the Legionnaires
used to show.";    It was a different era, and sex seemed like good clean fun.
"That was like in the hippie days," recalled porn goddess Chambers, then 19.
"Drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll.";    "They took Behind the Green Door to the
1973 Cannes Film Festival and it generated a lot of interest," said Meredith,
Artie's first wife. Jim, his first wife Adrienne, Artie, Meredith and Marilyn
sat in the balcony gauging the audience's reaction to their unofficial entry.
At the end of the movie, "The whole place just turned and stared at us," she
said. "We didn't know if they were mad, then they applauded. The next night it
was crowded, the streets were packed with people trying to get in."  -- R.W.  </TEXT>
