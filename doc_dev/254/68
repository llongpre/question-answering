<LEADPARA>  AMERICAN movies lack a genuine core of eroticism. The danger and allure of
sexual relationships -- which, of course, encompass so much more than sex --
are virtually absent from our screens.;   Right now in literature and painting
and sculpture and photography, some of our finest artists -- often in the face
of a punishing, uncomprehending hostility -- are trying to give expression to
their sexual feelings. But the movies, perhaps the most sensual art form of
all, are locked inside a kinder, gentler dream-time. The carnal and the
sentimental don't mix.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There is, of course, occasional high-flown pornography such as, most
recently, Ken Russell's "Whore." Or deluxe Eurotrash fantasias ("Wild
Orchid"), retro-blue sex comedies ("Switch") and pseudo-noir passion plays
("After Dark, My Sweet"). There are the high-gloss depravities of Peter
Greenaway.;   But sex as a fuse, as an instigator, as a kick, an obsession,
sex as an explicit and implicit part of our lives -- where are the movies that
speak to us of these things, of how complicated sex has become for us?;  
ISN'T it ironic that this lament comes just a little more than a year after
the Motion Picture Association of America revised its code by replacing the X
rating with the NC-17. By creating a new designation to replace the dreaded
porno-tinctured X, the MPAA theoretically made it possible for serious films
for adults to play the same multiplexes as the Rs and the PGs. It made it
possible for those film artists who for years had been pre-censoring
themselves to finally unloosen their gifts. And maybe it also had the power to
inspire a new generation of film artists who in the past were dissuaded from
exploring the medium.;   But, of course, it's one thing to sanction more
adult-oriented movies; it's another thing to make them. Since "Henry &amp; June"
in October 1990, there has not been a single major studio-financed and
distributed NC-17-rated movie. Because of cowardice, intimidation or
bottom-line-ism, film makers and producers and studio heads -- with the
support of such video chains as Blockbuster that refuse to carry NC-17 films
-- have backed off from the challenge. And in the process, they are missing an
opportunity to enlarge the thematic possibilities of films at a time when the
movies desperately need to be invigorated.;   The issue here is not, strictly
speaking, that movies need to be more sexually explicit. The argument, rather,
is that movies need a sexual scope they do not now have, and the NC-17
provides one way to go in providing that scope.;   There was a dream -- when
"Last Tango in Paris" came out in 1972 -- that first-class film artists would
finally be able to confront the rawness and shock of sexual emotion with the
same power employed by such writers as Norman Mailer and Henry Miller and D.H.
Lawrence. Today, the dream has practically faded from view. And if we are to
believe Paramount's Brandon Tartikoff, movies for adults don't cut the
commercial mustard any more.;   Certainly AIDS is responsible for some of the
pullback in movies with sexual themes, but here, too, the issue is more
complicated than it at first appears.;   It is not, after all, as if Hollywood
has ever been anxious to deal with the consequences of the sexual act. Part of
the fantasy appeal of movies is that they often do not deal with consequences.
AIDS introduces an element into the sexual equation too complex and tragic for
Hollywood to cope with; afraid of dealing with AIDS as a dramatic subject and
equally afraid of implying that we are not all a nation of abstainers and
celibates and safe-sexers, the studios have worked around the problem by
turning a clouded eye to the proceedings. Sex in modern movies now, when it
appears at all, is like a romp in never-never land.;   The apotheosis of this
attitude was the highly successful "sex, lies, and videotape" with its
impotent video voyeur as hero. The orgasm -- glory of the Beats, the hippies'
latchkey to liberation, the feminists' Valhalla -- was demystified in that
film. It was about sex as power play, as denial, as metaphor. Sex as sex was
disdained. The film appeared to have been made by a hip scold, and its
ecstatic reception suggested that perhaps AIDS-freaked audiences were primed
for a scolding.;   In the old Hays Office days in Hollywood in the 1930s, it
was written into the Production Code that no mention should be made in any
movie of sex hygiene or venereal disease. It also said, "Pictures shall not
infer that low forms of sex relationship are the accepted or common thing,"
and that "passion should be treated in such manner as not to stimulate the
lower and baser emotions.";   The official purpose of these prohibitions, of
course, was to uphold moral standards. Are we really so far from this
laughable, and hurtful, mind-set now?;   THERE has always been a symbiotic
relationship between the bourgeois status quo and those who are drawn to
undermine it. If the most interesting and maddening and controversial movies
of the last few years have often been on-the-edge in matters of sex -- "Wild
at Heart," "Internal Affairs," "The Grifters" and the films of Gus Van Sant --
the reason may be that these movies affront that status quo. They speak to
something disturbing in the atmosphere that the big, gauzy sex-and-romance
hits like "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" flee from.;   The traditional sex scene
in American movies, unlike its racier European counterpart, has usually been
keyed to a denial of explicitness; this may be one reason, besides the obvious
economic one, why American filmmakers in the NC-17 era are still so slow to
play show-and-tell.;   The famous erotic moments in American film, such as
Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr embracing in the waves in "From Here to
Eternity," or Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor mating their profiles in
"A Place in the Sun," are relatively chaste.;   Sexual symbols;   Americans
seem to need a bit of grandiloquence in their sex scenes if they are to be
"classic." They need an overarching romanticism that is, deliberately,
old-fashioned. The grandiloquence serves a dual purpose: It distances us by
its exaggeration but, by matching up with our fantasies, it also draws us
closer to the passion. It's this push-pull that provides the erotic
intoxication in many a great American film romance. The subtext keeps rubbing
up against the text.;   The paradox in contemporary American films which deal
with sex is that many of them, like "The Fabulous Baker Boys" or the current
"Frankie &amp; Johnny," combine both the new explicitness and the old-fashioned
romantic values. This combo cuts both ways. In "Fatal Attraction" the message
was: Stray and be punished. On the other hand, in "Bull Durham," we were
allowed to experience the sex as a high because the whole film was shot
through with the sheer joy of physical release.;   And, on a smaller scale,
the same thing could be said for Martha Coolidge's "Rambling Rose." (One way
to upgrade the quality of movie sex would be to get more women behind the
cameras.);   There have been a handful of American films recently -- "The
Unbearable Lightness of Being," "Enemies, A Love Story," "Heartbreakers" --
that communicated the ache of sexual longing in ways that seemed almost
revelatory, and many of the actors in these films, as if liberated by the
subject matter, have never been better.;   Sex as mechanics;   In most of the
new films, however, there's often so little going on between men and women on
any level that when sex happens it's weirdly abstract. In "9 1/2 Weeks" and
"Risky Business," for example, the eroticism was explicit but denatured. It
lacked the pang of real experience -- hence its appeal.;   IT USED to be that
Americans would look to European or Asian films for a more "grown-up"
treatment of sex. And until fairly recently, there were the films of such
directors as Bertrand Blier ("Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"), Pedro Almodovar
("Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"), Juzo Itami ("Tampopo") and
Stephen Frears ("My Beautiful Laundrette") to reward us. But with the
exception of Frears, and perhaps Almodovar, most of the recent work of these
directors has lost its sexual edge.;   The house style in European movie
eroticism has become a variation on our own: sleek, characterless, insensate.
"9 1/2 Weeks," which was much more popular in Europe than in this country, has
set the standard all over the world.;   It's naive to think that in matters
carnal filmmakers work out of some private erotic realm, oblivious to politics
of state or studio. The current economic downturn and disillusionment may, if
nothing else, have a humbling, restorative impact on our human sympathies. Sex
in the movies has often had the effect of objectifying, trivializing and
exploiting its on-screen participants. If our filmmakers want to put the pang
of real experience back into sex, they must first acknowledge that real
people, and not androids, are involved in the act.  </TEXT>
