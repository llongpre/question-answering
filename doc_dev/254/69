   A prosecutor said today that sexually graphic
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe were convincing evidence in
themselves for a conviction in the obscenity trial of an art
gallery and its director.
   But a lawyer for the Contemporary Arts Center said the state
failed to show that the exhibit lacked artistic merit.
   The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
are charged with one count each of pandering obscenity and one
count each of using children in nudity-related material.
   The misdemeanor charges stem from the exhibit ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'' which appeared in Cincinnati
for seven weeks last spring.
   Barrie could be sentenced to a year in jail and fined $2,000 if
convicted of both counts. The gallery could be fined $10,000.
   Frank Prouty, an assistant city prosecutor, said in his closing
argument that five photos depicting graphic sex acts involving men
and two that showed children with their genitals exposed were
enough for convictions. The charges against the gallery and its
director, Dennis Barrie, were based on those seven pictures in the
175-photo exhibit.
   ``The pictures speak for themselves,'' Prouty told the jury in
Hamilton County Municipal Court. ``The pictures are the issue.''
   Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, said the state failed to
prove its case against the center and Barrie. No presentation was
made to back up the assertion that the photographs were not
legitimate art.
   ``Have you thought why it is that no one for the state of Ohio
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic
value? Don't you think that if there were people out there who
thought that, the state of Ohio would have found them?'' Mezibov
said.
   Barrie's attorney, H. Louis Sirkin, was scheduled to present his
closing remarks later Friday, and the case was expected to go to
the jury.
   Defense lawyers Thursday challenged the credentials of the
prosecution's only expert witness, Judith Reisman, on grounds that
she was not qualified, but Judge David Albanese ruled she could
testify.
   Ms. Reisman said her qualifications included having prepared
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian
Institution.
   She also worked as a consultant for television's ``Captain
Kangaroo'' show, for former Attorney General Edwin Meese's
commission on pornography and for the onservative American Family
Association.
   At issue in the trial are seven photographs a grand jury cited
from the 175-photo exhibit. Five of the pictures depict sexually
explicit acts involving men and two show children with their
genitals exposed.
   Ms. Reisman testified that photographing nude children can be a
prelude to sexual abuse.
   ``We are putting at risk additional children because many people
see themselves as photographers, and many people do use the
technique of telling children `this is appropriate because this is
in a museum,' `this is appropriate because it is in a book,''' she
said.
   ``That happens to be a standard technique for getting children
into a child sex-abuse situation.''
   Defense experts have testified that Mapplethorpe, who died last
year of AIDS at age 42, was an accomplished and respected
photographer, and that photographs of the children were morally and
sexually innocent.
   The exhibit drew more than 80,000 people during its seven-week
run, an attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. It
closes this week in Boston, where 103,000 tickets have been sold.
