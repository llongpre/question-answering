   A jury on Friday acquitted an art gallery and
its director of obscenity charges for exhibiting sexually graphic
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   Dennis Barrie, director of the Contemporary Arts Center, smiled
as the verdict was read. Spectators in the courtroom shouted and
applauded, and Barrie hugged his lawyers.
   In the nation's first obscenity trial of an art institution, the
gallery and Barrie were acquitted of misdemeanor charges of
pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related material.
Barrie could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined
$2,000, and the gallery fined $10,000, if convicted of both counts.
   In closing arguments, the prosecutor said the sexually graphic
photographs were convincing evidence in themselves for a
conviction.
   But a lawyer for the Contemporary Arts Center said the state
failed to show the exhibit lacked artistic merit.
   The misdemeanor charges stemmed from the exhibit ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'' which appeared in Cincinnati
for seven weeks last spring.
   Frank Prouty, an assistant city prosecutor, said in his closing
argument that five photos depicting graphic sex acts involving men
and two that showed children with their genitals exposed were
enough for convictions. The charges were based on those seven
pictures in the 175-photo exhibit.
   ``The pictures speak for themselves,'' Prouty told the jury in
Hamilton County Municipal Court. ``The pictures are the issue.''
   Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, said the state failed to
prove its case against the center and Barrie. No presentation was
made to back up the assertion that the photographs weren't
legitimate art.
   ``Have you thought why it is that no one for the state of Ohio
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic
value? Don't you think that if there were people out there who
thought that, the state of Ohio would have found them?'' Mezibov
said.
   Barrie's attorney, H. Louis Sirkin, reminded jurors that the
same exhibit was shown hn Philadelphia, Chicago and Berkeley,
Calif., without incident.
   ``Is Cincinnati that different? Are we that childish? Are we not
big enough to say we can't accept what other cities have seen?''
Sirkin asked.
   Judge David Albanese instructed the jury shortly after noon.
   On Thursday, defense lawyers challenged the credentials of the
prosecution's only expert witness, Judith Reisman, on grounds that
she was unqualified, but Albanese ruled she could testify.
   Ms. Reisman said her qualifications included having prepared
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian
Institution.
   She also worked as a consultant for television's ``Captain
Kangaroo'' show, for former Attorney General Edwin Meese's
commission on pornography and for the conservative American Family
Association.
   At issue in the trial were seven photographs a grand jury cited
from the 175-photo exhibit.
   Ms. Reisman testified that photographing nude children can be a
prelude to sexual abuse.
   ``We are putting at risk additional children because many people
see themselves as photographers, and many people do use the
technique of telling children `this is appropriate because this is
in a museum,' `this is appropriate because it is in a book,''' she
said.
   ``That happens to be a standard technique for getting children
into a child sex-abuse situation.''
   Defense experts have testified that Mapplethorpe, who died last
year of AIDS at age 42, was an accomplished and respected
photographer, and that photographs of the children were morally and
sexually innocent.
   The exhibit drew more than 80,000 people during its seven-week
run, an attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. It
closes this week in Boston, where 103,000 tickets have been sold.
