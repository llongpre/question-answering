   Penthouse magazine sued a religious organization in
federal court Tuesday, accusing the group of using extortion and
racketeering to suppress the sale of adult magazines.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S District Court names the Florida
chapter of the American Family Association. It seeks to recover at
least $25,000 the magazine claims it lost when a grocery store
chain stopped selling Penthouse, according to a statement from
Penthouse International.
   A similar lawsuit was filed against the association two weeks
ago by retailing and publishing companies, including Playboy
magazine and the Waldenbooks book store chain.
   ``These people represent the worst possible element in a free
society,'' Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione said in the statement.
``They will not rest until the public, through its inaction, allows
them to regulate and approve our reading, viewing, listening and
other educational and entertainment activities.''
   A call late Tuesday to the group's state headquarters in Tampa
seeking comment was not immediately returned. A home phone number
for the group's state director, David Caton, was unlisted.
   The lawsuit accuses the association and Caton of distributing a
letter in September to store chains ``threatening them with legal
action and public ridicule unless they agreed to stop selling the
magazines,'' the statement said.
   The letter claimed the stores were violating Florida's obscenity
statute and promised to name those stores as violators and demand
enforcement.
   The publishing companies have said the statute applies only to
publishers. The association acknowledged in a news release that was
included in the earlier lawsuit that the pornography statute
applies only to publishing companies.
   The association has campaigned for years against the sale of
magazines such as Penthouse and Playboy. The association, which has
also backed boycotts of TV programs it considers offensive, most
recently persuaded Matchbox to cancel sale of a Freddy Krueger
doll, based on the ghoulish killer in ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
movies.
