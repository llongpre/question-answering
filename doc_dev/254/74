   Pornographic actor John Holmes, who made
hundreds of sexually explicit films during a career spanning two
decades, has died. He was 43 years old and reportedly had AIDS.
   Holmes, a leading sex film actor of the 1970s and early '80s,
died at 1 a.m. Sunday at the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Sepulveda, said his manager, adult film producer William Amerson.
   The cause of death was not immediately known, Amerson said
Sunday. The Los Angeles Times, citing anonymous sources, reported
earlier this month that Holmes was gravely ill with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The hospital refused to immediately confirm the death.
   Holmes' death came weeks after police re-questioned him in the
unsolved 1981 bludgeoning murders of four people in a Laurel Canyon
home. Holmes was acquitted of the murders during a 1982 trial in
which jurors cited a lack of corroborating evidence.
   Holmes remained in jail for 111 days after the trial for
refusing to tell the Los Angeles County Grand Jury what he knew
about the slayings. During his incarceration he said his life had
been threatened by ``bad people with guns, bad breath and no sense
of humor.''
   He was released after testifying to the grand jury, but no one
else was ever charged in the slayings, which remain unsolved.
   At the trial, the prosecutor alleged that Holmes led the
murderers at gunpoint to the house at the orders of a nightclub
owner seeking revenge for a robbery.
   During this year's questioning, Holmes refused to talk about the
case, his attorney, Mitchell Egers, said two weeks ago.
   In his career, Holmes made hundreds of sexually explicit films
and thousands of peep shows. He was most notorious for his
portrayal of the character ``Johnny Wadd,'' a detective.
   He also admitted after his trial that he had a $1,000-a-day
cocaine habit that took the money he made from porn films.
   AIDS is transmitted through sex, shared hypodermic needles,
tainted blood products and from pregnant women to their babies.
