   A year after being disgraced by charges
of sexual misconduct, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart portrays his plight
as a life-and-death struggle against ``pornographers'' who are
trying to topple his TV ministry.
   ``This is the crisis point in this ministry. Satan has come at us
with his mightiest blow. He has not succeeded. He will not
succeed,'' Swaggart said last weekend on his hourlong television
program.
   Swaggart said that without an influx of donations, his television
ministry will leave the air Feb. 26 _ a year and five days after he
tearfully confessed from the pulpit to an unspecified sin.
   It's been a long year for Swaggart's ministry, which had seemed
to be on top of the evangelical world after the fall of PTL's Jim
Bakker.
   Shortly after Swaggart's confession to his congregation, New
Orleans prostitute Debra Murphree said he had paid her to pose nude
for him, a claim she repeated for a Penthouse magazine article.
   Swaggart originally agreed not to preach for three months, in
accordance with a recommendation from the Assemblies of God state
council, but resigned from the Pentecostal denomination after
national leaders demanded that he stay away from the pulpit at least
a year. At the same time Swaggart resigned, the Assemblies dismissed
him.
   Although the ministry refused to reveal specifics of its ensuing
financial plight as donations dropped, Swaggart held a telethon to
raise money to stay afloat; laid off employees from his ministry,
one of Baton Rouge's major employers; called off construction plans;
and put the ministry's jet up for sale.
   Once the highest-rated television preacher with viewership
estimated at more than 2 million, Swaggart was dropped from three
major cable television networks. His Family Worship Center, which
seats 5,000 and was filled to the rafters for his confession, now
displays signs informing worshipers that its large balcony is closed.
   The Assemblies of God said it would revoke credentials of
ministers who remained part of Swaggart's organization, and at least
two churches were formed in the Baton Rouge area by ministers who
left Swaggart. Many faculty left Swaggart's Bible college,
enrollment dropped, and some graduates last spring wondered aloud if
their diplomas could be changed to eliminate reference to the
evangelist.
   Nevertheless, around Thanksgiving, Swaggart told his congregation
that the ministry had turned the corner. His television program
began broadcasts to China in January.
   Throughout, Swaggart remained mum about Murphree's claim. But he
broke his silence last month when a New Orleans stripper, Catherine
Mary Kampen, made similar allegations, and, like Murphree, sold her
story to Penthouse.
   ``There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I have
never met or seen this woman,'' he said. The ministry promised a
libel lawsuit and said it had evidence Kampen made up the
allegations, though she and Penthouse said they stood by the story.
   ``This is a crime. It is a filth that must be eradicated from the
land,'' Swaggart said during a Jan. 30 news conference in which he
declared war on ``pornographers.''
   Two days later, Swaggart warned his congregation that another
plot to subvert his ministry might be in the works, ``as
preposterous as this one. ... If you have enough money, you can get
anyone to say anything.'' Then came the threat a week ago to halt
the TV ministry unless enough donations come in.
   On Wednesday night, Swaggart said his followers were responding
to his plea for money, ``but I don't want to shout too much because
there are newsmen here and they might think we're rich.'' Swaggart
said he had met several times with ``one of the world's foremost
lawyers.''
   For now, Swaggart says his followers must decide.
   ``You are making a choice today, a choice between the
pornographers that are working more diligently than you will ever
know ... or it's us. It's either the devil or darkness or it's God
and light.''
