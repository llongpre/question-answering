<LEADPARA>  LARRY LAFFER is 43 years old, slump-shouldered, balding, pathetic. Did we
mention lecherous? Sort of an Everyman-on-the-make. His wife this very day
kicked him out of their island home, replaced him with a lesbian slot-machine
repairwoman who rode a Harley right into her heart. So now Larry's ready to
take another swing at the swinging life.;   He eyeballs a young woman as she
tans topless on Sunaffa Beach. Approaching the sun worshiper, he mutters
awkwardly, "Uh, hello. My name's Larry."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     She stands up before him, lean, bare and uninhibited. Her name is Tawni,
she says. "I'm a material girl." No matter. Larry isn't looking for witty
conversation; he isn't capable of it.;   Larry pulls out his shiny new credit
card and promises her a trip to nearby Nontoonyt Mall. Suddenly Tawni's
passions are charged; they engage in furious sex there on the beach. Minutes
later, Larry is off again looking for his next conquest.;   Boot up! Bam!
Thank-you ma'am! In the fast-evolving world of home computers,
adult-entertainment software is giving new meaning to "user friendly.";  
These are computer games with no points but plenty of scoring. Instead of
simulation software, the kind that typically provides players hands-on
experience as fighter pilots, professional golfers and medieval knights, this
small but growing niche might better be called stimulation software.;   Enter
the wanton world of promiscuous personal computing.;   "I don't consider it
nearly as bad as prime-time television," says Ken Williams, president of
Sierra On-Line Inc., the Oakhurst, Calif.-based software publisher that last
month released the fourth of its popular "Leisure Suit Larry" series. Players
assist the libidinous klutz in pursuing graphic, on-screen sexual encounters
with a bevy of pixel floozies, all built like brick microchips.;   The
cartoonish Larry squints through binoculars to ogle a woman undressing; he
hits on a nightclub showgirl who falls for his real-estate pitch; he seduces a
bimbo named Bambi in the tanning salon after aerobics class.;   The label on
the $59 "Leisure Suit Larry" box cover is frank about its contents: "Warning.
This game contains adult subject matter. Parental guidance is suggested.";  
As chairman of the standards committee of the Software Publishers Association,
Williams six months ago raised the issue of labeling computer games the way
films are rated (G, PG, PG-13 etc.). Responses from member publishers, he
says, ranged from resisting censorship in any form to wanting to ban all games
with violent or sexual content. The issue proved too hot to handle. "We
basically gave up," he says.;   Yet Williams believes computer games should be
rated and labeled -- not to censor but to clarify what's inside the box. As a
parent, he's concerned that children otherwise may find themselves gripping a
joystick for on-screen action that isn't appropriate.;   "Games are being sold
with an excess of violence," he says, describing one bloody action game in
which characters are blown apart. "I bought it for my children, but until I
owned the game I had no idea the violence was so graphic. There should've been
a warning on it.";   Eight years ago, when Sierra introduced the first game of
the series, "Leisure Suit Larry: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards," the
company received a lot of negative mail. Since then, Larry's sexploits have
become "an accepted part of the computer landscape," says Williams, who
contends it is humorous and harmless adult entertainment that would deserve no
worse than a PG-13 rating if it were a movie. "It's a parody. It pokes fun at
the swinging singles scene.";   "People have a right to read or see what they
want -- even if it is on the computer screen," Williams says. "There is no
distinction between other forms of entertainment and computer entertainment.";
  Still, success breeds sex. Fringe software publishers are providing more
hard core for America's hard disks.;   Carnal computing is on the rise at a
time high-tech innovations such as scanned computer graphics and
high-resolution VGA monitors can reproduce on-screen images of
near-photographic quality and even create short computer movies.;   "It goes
as far as any X-rated videotape would go," says the owner of Sexxy Software,
describing the explicit content of his products, which feature nudes, raunchy
games and sex-act flicks. He says he doesn't want his name in print. He
describes himself as a respected business programmer from California who two
years ago saw the recession around the corner, recognized an unmet demand in
software and decided to make some money.;   The company recently released a
$79 computer game called "SexxCapades" -- sort of a bedroom "Monopoly" in
which indelicate sexual favors are sought instead of property and hotels. At
the beginning, players make their choice of "straight sex, gay sex or anything
goes." Their pieces automatically move around the on-screen game board,
landing on spaces that instruct players to perform specific immodest acts,
most of them demonstrated in an X-rated movie scene in the middle of the
board.;   So far, business has been "pretty steady," says Sexxy Software's
owner. "All the major developers have shied away from doing it, but the
marketplace has been asking for more and more explicit games and pictures.";  
His biggest problem? "Getting magazines to run the ads," he says, including
Compute! magazine, owned by Penthouse's publishers. "We try to make the ads as
tasteful as possible and try to make sure our products don't get into the
hands of any minors. But they get complaints from people who don't want to
open a computer magazine and see a page of naked women."  </TEXT>
