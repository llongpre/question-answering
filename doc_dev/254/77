   Three children who attended a
day-care center owned by a man charged with having child
pornography contracted a sexually transmitted disease, police said.
   Authorities said no evidence links the infections to the
preschool or its owner.
   Examinations found gonorrhea infections in the throats of three
of the dozens of children examined at Broward County's Sexual
Assault Treatment Center.
   The tests came after the arrest of preschool owner John W.
Shaver, 56, two weeks ago on five counts of possessing child
pornography for magazines police found at his home, across the
street from his Rainbow Learning Center.
   Police would not say whether the children who tested positive
were male or female and did not release their ages.
   Police have said 20 children who attended Shaver's preschool
were identified by their parents in hundreds of nude photographs
found at Shaver's house. The pictures do not depict sex acts or
sexual poses, but show the children at play, authorities said.
   ``This is an ongoing investigation, and we can't answer any
questions about the investigation itself,'' police Capt. Bruce
Smith said during a news conference late Friday.
   ``There is, however, no direct evidence linking the disease to
the facility'' or Shaver, Smith said.
   Police would not say whether Shaver tested positive for the
disease. He remained under treatment Friday at the Crisis
Stabilization Center in Pembroke Pines after cutting his wrist last
week in an apparent suicide attempt.
   Shaver has denied any wrongdoing during the widening police
investigation, saying ``I have not behaved improperly to any
child.''
   Neither police nor Joanne Richter, director of the treatment
center, could say how the children may have been infected.
   ``The most likely hypothesis is they were forced to perform oral
sex with the infected adult, most likely a male,'' said Dr. Sally
S. Atherton, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at
the University of Miami School of Medicine. ``It's not something
you pass around. It's a bacteria; it requires contact.''
   The children have been treated, police said. Most cases of
gonorrhea can be cured with penicillin or other antibiotics,
especially if the disease is diagnosed early.
   Shaver was released on $5,000 bond last week on the charges of
possessing child pornography, a third-degree felony punishable by a
maximum five-year prison sentence. Shaver has admitted owning the
magazines but denies taking nude photographs of children.
   Although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under
the law, they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against
Shaver if the evidence meets that criteria, police have said.
   Police said they were being careful with the information they
release about the case to prevent hysteria.
   ``Our No. 1 concern is the children,'' Maj. Joe Donisi said.
``We don't want to traumatize the kids into thinking something has
happened.''
   Broward County officials shut down Shaver's day-care center last
week, contending Shaver ``lacked good moral character.'' About 200
children have attended the center since Shaver opened it in 1985
for children ages 3 to 5.
