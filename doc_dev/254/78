THE PERVERSION OF TRUTH CONTINUES IN ALLEGING A PORN-CRIME LINK

By AL GOLDSTEIN, Al Goldstein is a contributing editor for Penthouse magazine 
and the publisher of Screw, which he describes as a satirical-sexual newspaper.

When Ted Bundy ended his last jailhouse interview just hours before he went to 
Florida's electric chair for the crime of murder, he left a different kind of 
carnage behind. Truth was massacred, logic was crippled and maimed, the ground 
was littered with tautologies and half-truths. 
</P>
<P>
His partners in this, the last crime that he was able to commit, were the 
media, for the loving and devoted credence that they lent to his claims, and 
James Dobson of the Los Angeles religious broadcast "Focus on the Family." Ted 
Bundy lied all the way through his dramatic last interview, and the media 
didn't call him on it, and Dr. Dobson actually fostered those lies. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson is a former member of the so-called Meese Commission, the pro-censorship 
task force assembled by our now-disgraced former attorney general. If anyone 
has anything bad to say about adult-oriented material, Dobson is there to hear 
it and add his hearty hosannas. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy had plenty bad to say about sex and violence in the media. In fact, he 
blamed the media for his crimes. But if we are to remain a nation guided by 
reason and not by such jailhouse histrionics, we must formulate an answer to 
Bundy and, more important, to Dobson. 
</P>
<P>
Let us begin at the beginning, and focus on the family, as Dobson and Bundy 
did. Their argument was artfully conceived. They portrayed Ted as a young boy 
from a perfectly fine home who was corrupted by the influence of pornography. 
That "fine solid Christian home" (as Bundy put it) deserves a closer look, 
because it allowed Dobson to extrapolate the dangers to his own constituency. 
"Pornography can reach out and snatch a kid from any house today" is how master 
manipulator Bundy put it in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
But was Ted Bundy's early life average or normal? Was Ted's house "any" house? 
He was an illegitimate child, and the grandfather who raised him was a violent 
man who vented his aggressions against people and animals both. At 4, Ted was 
removed from his grandparents' house by his mother, who took him to Seattle, 
where she later married a man who was seen sending roundhouse rights in Ted's 
direction. If this is the "solid Christian home" that Dobson is intent on 
presenting, we are all in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson didn't call the killer on his rather obvious lie (although all the facts 
are available in the numerous books on Bundy). But what was Bundy's reason for 
twisting the truth? The man whom Dobson asked us to believe was, of course, a 
pathological liar. But he had a reason for this particular lie, and he stated 
it: "I hope nobody will try to take the easy way out and try to blame or 
otherwise accuse my family of contributing (to his crimes)." Don't worry, Ted, 
the media will swallow your easy way out -- "pornography made me do it" -- 
hook, line and sinker. 
</P>
<P>
The facts about violence and pornography clearly point away from the conclusion 
that Dobson wants to draw from the monstrous case of Ted Bundy. Adult 
entertainment is such an easy target, since many of its users are too timid or 
guilt-ridden to defend it. The implicit message of the Dobson-Bundy interview 
is that we should censor adult material. But censorship, once embarked on, has 
a way of growing out of control. Look to Iran, or the Soviet Union, to see 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
Does porn cause violence? Clearly, no. In laboratory settings, viewing 
nonviolent sexually explicit material actually reduces aggressive tendencies. 
This suggests that nonviolent pornography can help reduce the rate of rape. In 
fact, that is exactly what happened when Denmark legalized pornography: Rape 
rates went down, and then stabilized at a lower level. 
</P>
<P>
But that's "nonviolent" sexual material. Isn't all pornography getting more 
violent, as Dobson suggests? The Meese Commission itself did a study of the top 
dozen "men's sophisticate" magazines. The study concluded that there was a 
negligible violent content in these mainstream magazines -- only 0.6% of the 
total imagery! Yet Dobson repeatedly tars Playboy, Penthouse and soft-core 
material with the same brush that he uses for "slasher" movies. In fact, in the 
interview Bundy himself did not refer to pornography without the qualifier 
"violent." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, James Dobson is offering the Ted Bundy interview on videotape as a 
fund-raising vehicle for his "Focus on the Family." It is a vile and cynical 
effort to inflame the censorship debate in America. The Big Lie of Dobson's 
argument is concealed, Goebbels-style, within his rant: If you read Playboy or 
Penthouse, you will turn into Ted Bundy. Does this make any sense to anyone 
outside the puritanical precincts of Dobsonland? 
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate for us all that the lies and killings of Ted Bundy have stopped 
forever. James Dobson's assault against the truth continues, however. Until the 
debate about censorship is conducted beneath the aegis of reason, and not 
manipulated behind a smokescreen of emotion,the First Amendment and its 
guarantees of free expression remain in danger.
