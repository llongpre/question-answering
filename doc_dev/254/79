<LEADPARA>  It was an irresistible story, a tragic story. One that hardly any working man
or woman could watch without feeling a twinge of empathy or horror, perhaps
even panic.;   Listening Friday as Anita Hill detailed charges that Supreme
Court nominee Clarence Thomas harassed her with vivid, pornographic, sometimes
bizarre talk, one local lawyer couldn't help but remember an experience of her
own more than 10 years ago. A boss made lewd comments and showed her a picture
of a nude woman.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I didn't confront him. I continued to have a professional relationship
with him," the woman said regretfully. "In retrospect, I would have handled it
differently. . . . I'm sorry to say I didn't realize I had an option.";   An
executive named John had quite a different reaction. He was threatened.;  
"From now on, I'm only going to hire big floppy women, so there is no chance
any men in my office will be attracted to a co-worker," the man said over
dinner at Bini's Restaurant in San Jose.;   "Anyone that hires a woman, you
can't say 'Sweetie, that's a good job' or 'Sweetie, you look good today' -- if
you say that, you're dead. It's too risky. It's illegal.";   From the outset
of the controversy, far more than Thomas' Supreme Court nomination has been at
stake. In a sense, the hearings have placed every office in America on trial
as the allegations dredged up all the confusion and conflict that have beset
men and women for as long as they have worked together.;   "People really
don't know how to behave toward one another and they're very surprised when
what they do turns out to be wrong," said Barbara Hornum, an anthropologist at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, who created a course called Women and Men
in a Changing Society.;   "The norms are just not there to tell them how to
behave," she said, "and what may have been appropriate for previous
generations or at a cocktail party simply isn't.";   Hill's allegations that
Judge Thomas spoke of the size of his penis and gave graphic details of
pornographic movies -- furiously denied by Thomas -- also have provoked
discussions about the different ways men and women talk about sex.;   "Men and
women don't talk about things the same way, and that's part of this," said
Susan Ervin-Tripp, a psychology professor at the University of California,
Berkeley. "I think it's a watershed event in that the difference in points of
view between men and women are now being made public.";   Martin Linsky, a
lecturer in public policy at Harvard University, believes the intensely
personal drama unfolding on national TV will help people better understand
sexual harassment.;   "It doesn't make any difference if Thomas gets confirmed
or not," he said. "We are not learning about what we expect from Supreme Court
justices but about men and women in the workplace.";   Many women, along with
many of the senators who questioned Hill on Friday, credit her with bringing
about what one feminist lawyer has called a "national teach-in on sexual
harassment." A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted this week found four out
of 10 American women said they had been "the object of sexual advances,
propositions or unwanted sexual discussions" from men in positions of power at
work.;   Hill a 'hero'; "Women are grateful that Professor Hill has had the
courage to put her career on the line," said Katherine Spillar, of the Fund
for the Feminist Majority in Los Angeles. "Women have been calling and saying
she's a hero because she had the courage to speak out.";   Men are calling
too, hundreds of them in the past week, dialing (212) 686-MALE to talk with
Sidney Siller, the New York trial lawyer who founded the National Organization
for Men.;   They're frightened, Siller said, "of being charged with something
they didn't do." And he believes the fear will linger. "I think men are going
to be afraid to talk to women when the dust from this settles. A wall is going
up between men and women.";   But that is just one man's opinion.;   Others
were impressed with Hill's cool, graceful demeanor under unimaginably trying
circumstances.;   "In my opinion, she's telling the truth," said Bill
Quackenbush, a San Mateo attorney who handles sexual harassment cases. "It's
reasonably clear she did not precipitate this type of behavior.";   
Harassment claims; Quackenbush said he got two calls Friday from women
complaining of sexual harassment. Normally, he averages one call every two
weeks.;   Some people were outraged by the Senate panel's questioning of Hill,
particularly when Sen. Howell Heflin asked her, "Are you a scorned woman?";  
"It made me extremely angry," said local attorney Dana Curtis, who said the
question was "an effort to undermine (Hill's) credibility.";   At the Fremont
law offices of Gonsalves and Kozachenko, attorney Gail Hashimoto said she and
her colleagues had been debating the definition of sexual harassment all
week.;   "We were in the law library yesterday, talking about whether 'dumb
blond' jokes are sexual harassment," Hashimoto said.;   Both lawyers and
secretaries have been drawn into the discussions, but the men have had less to
say than the women.;   "I think it's because women are more sensitized to the
issue, because women are more likely to be affected," Hashimoto said.;   At
San Jose State University, dozens of students were riveted to television sets
Friday, watching the hearings. Some waited for cracks in Hill's credibility.
Others saw it as a historic moment in gender relations.;   "Whether you like
it or not, sexual harassment is going to be an issue that's going to be
addressed," said Beverly Larsen, a 48-year-old psychology major.;   Lori Kott,
a 23-year-old graduate student, said Hill's example would help other women
speak about sexual harassment. "It is a subject that needs to be known.";  
Others saw the hearing as a simple, isolated matter of who was telling the
truth: him or her.;   "I really don't consider it that important," said San
Jose State student Lenny Luscher, 21. "I'm having a difficult time with what
she's saying.";   Still others felt the political process of examining the
allegations had become too destructive.;   "It's been publicized like the
opening of a movie," said Angela Mattiuz, an 18-year-old freshman. "Judge
Thomas can't win. Professor Hill can't win.";   San Jose lawyer Zaida Hackett
said she believes sexual harassment is a problem that needs attention, so
"it's probably the best thing for this to come out." But she still has
sympathy for Thomas because if the harassment occurred, it happened years ago
and "everyone can be rehabilitated.";   Hackett was struck by the ordeal of
both Hill and Thomas as she watched Friday's hearings with a female
colleague.;   "She turned to me and said, 'This is very sad,' and I had to
agree with her."  </TEXT>
