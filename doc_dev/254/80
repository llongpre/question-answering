<LEADPARA>  An infuriated Judge Clarence Thomas accused his Senate interrogators Friday
night of "lynching" him with "sleaze" and charged that Professor Anita Hill
had lied when she said he had discussed pornographic sex acts with her.;  
"From my standpoint, as a black American, it is a high-tech lynching for
uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for
themselves, to have different ideas," Thomas said, glaring at members of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The dramatic confrontation between a man and a woman over what they said to
each other nearly a decade ago ended at 7:35 p.m. PDT, leaving Americans
wondering, as Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., summed it up: "Who's telling the
truth?";   In her testimony, a poised and articulate Hill provided lurid
details she had not furnished earlier to FBI agents or committee
investigators.;   She said his repeated and unwelcome requests for dates,
boasts about the size of his penis, discussions of his sexual prowess and
conversations about various sex acts had "embarrassed and humiliated" her on
the job.;   Defenders of Thomas attempted to build a case that Hill was
unstable, suffered from romantic fantasies, provided statements containing
numerous inconsistencies and unreasonably continued a friendly relationship
with Thomas for years after he had allegedly harassed her sexually.;   Thomas,
battling for his reputation and for a Supreme Court seat that may be slipping
away, said the "disgusting" committee hearing was "a circus" that had
delivered "a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will
happen to you.;   "You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee
of the U.S. Senate, rather than hung from a tree," exclaimed Thomas, who will
resume his self-defense this morning.;   Thomas said he had not watched Hill's
earlier testimony on television because "I've heard enough lies.";   Thomas
said he sometimes would visit Hill in her Capitol Hill apartment "and have a
Coke or a beer or something and continue arguing about politics for maybe 45
minutes to an hour.";   Sen Arlen Specter, R-Pa., declared later: "That
certainly undercuts her contention that she wouldn't have anything to do with
him socially.";   The 43-year-old federal judge denied "all of the
allegations," declaring he had never even tried to date Hill. His voice
quavering, Thomas spoke of hordes of reporters and pressure groups "looking
for dirt" on him for 101 days and said he felt humiliated by it all.;  
'Eating my insides out'; "I have been racking my brains and eating my insides
out," Thomas told the senators at the outset of the hearing, "trying to think
of what I could have said or done to Anita Hill to lead her to allege that I
was interested in her in more than a professional way and that I talked with
her about pornographic films.;   "This is not American. This is Kafkaesque. It
has got to stop. . . . Enough is enough. . . . I am not going to allow myself
to be further humiliated to be confirmed," he said.;   Hill buttressed her
account by recalling that she had confided in three friends while she worked
for Thomas because "I was really upset. I felt that my job could be taken
away. . . . that this person (Thomas) who had some power in the new (Reagan)
administration would make it difficult for me. . . . I thought that he was
using his power as an employer over me.";   Her friends are on a list of
witnesses to appear later in the nationally televised hearing, which is
expected to continue through the weekend.;   A Senate confirmation vote, which
had been postponed to allow further investigation of Hill's charges, has been
rescheduled for Tuesday.;   Anti-Hill statement released; During the hearing,
the committee released the sworn statement of John Doggett III, an Austin,
Texas, lawyer and former Yale Law School classmate of Thomas. Doggett recalled
that Hill chided him in 1983 for leading her on and failing to date her.;   "I
had never expressed a romantic interest in her. . . . I came away . . .
feeling that she was romantically unstable and . . . had fantasized about my
being interested in her romantically," Doggett wrote.;   Hill said that when
she worked as Thomas' legal assistant at the Department of Education and the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1981 to 1983, he tried
unsuccessfully to date her five to 10 times and spoke to her "about acts he
had seen in pornographic films.";   He said the films showed "women having sex
with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes" and spoke of
"pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large
breasts involved in various sex acts." On several occasions, she said, "Thomas
told me graphically of his own sexual prowess. . . .;   "One of the oddest
episodes," she said, occurred in his office when he walked to his desk to get
a Coke, "looked at the can and said, 'Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?' ";  
At other times, she testified, "he referred to the size of his own penis as
being larger than normal and he also spoke on occasion of the pleasures he had
given to women with oral sex.;   "I felt that implicit in this discussion
about sex was the offer to have sex with him, not just . . . going out to
dinner or going to a particular concert or movie.";   Biden digs for details;
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., seeking details about Thomas' alleged
remarks about sex, elicited from Hill a memory that he had referred to the
name of a pornographic character "who had a very large penis." Biden asked her
to name the character. "The name that was referred to was Long Dong Silver,"
she said.;   Thomas denied each alleged incident as his wife, Virginia, wiped
tears away. "Senator," Thomas said at one point, "I am incapable of proving
the negative. It did not occur.";   Hill, 35, a professor at the University of
Oklahoma Law School, admitted that "I may have shirked a duty" and "may have
used poor judgment" by failing to file a formal complaint about the incidents,
particularly when she and Thomas worked for the agency responsible for
enforcing civil rights laws barring sexual harassment in the workplace. But
she explained that she did not want to damage her career or "burn all my
bridges. . . .;   "I have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas," she
said, recalling that a committee investigator had gone to her for information
and "I felt that I had no other choice but to tell the truth.";   She recalled
that on her last day at the EEOC, she had dinner with Thomas, which she
described as professional, not social, and said: "He made a comment which I
vividly remember. He said that if I told anyone about his behavior toward me,
it could ruin his career.";   Specter, challenging Hill's credibility, asked
her about differences between her statements to the FBI and her more detailed
testimony to the committee. She explained that, in her conversations with FBI
agents, she described the incidents only "to my level of comfort.";   Specter
asked why she kept in touch with Thomas after she leaving Washington to teach
in Oklahoma "if he had been so disgusting to you.";   At a distance, she said
she no longer felt threatened. "I was removed from the harassment. . . . I did
not feel it was necessary to cut off all ties, to burn all bridges, to treat
him in a hostile manner," she said.;   Thomas said he "cannot imagine anything
I said or did to Anita Hill that could have been mistaken for sexual
harassment.";   The White House and Senate Republicans denied rumors that
Thomas would withdraw.;   "Are you kidding?" asked Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
"Thomas is not going to withdraw. He's going to have a vote, and I think he'll
win the vote."  </TEXT>
