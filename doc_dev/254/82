<HEAD>Radio Shack Dealer To Stand Trial for Videotaping Employees Having

   A Radio Shack dealer on Tuesday was
ordered to stand trial for inviting his teen-age employees to have
sex with their boyfriends in the back room of his store and
videotaping their activities.
   Howard R. DeYoung, who operates the electronics store in Dorr,
15 miles south of Grand Rapids, allegedly made the room available
after work to female workers, who were minors, said Detective Rick
Cain of the Allegan County Sheriff's Department.
   He provided them with sexual aids, pornographic magazines and
alcohol, Cain said.
   DeYoung, 38, allegedly used electronic surveillance equipment to
make sexually explicit photographs, videotapes and audio recordings
of as many as 20 area teens who used the room over the last 2{
years, Cain said.
   DeYoung was ordered to stand trial on three charges of child
abusive commercial activity, a felony punishable by up to 20 years
in prison, and three counts of electronic eavesdropping, punishable
by two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   Defense lawyer Larry Woods has maintained DeYoung's innocence.
He is scheduled to be arraigned in Circuit Court Friday.
   It's not alleged that DeYoung sold or distributed the tapes.
   Three former female employees testified Tuesday they had no idea
their activities were being recorded.
   ``He told us that we could go in there to be alone,'' one said.
The three women all are now older than 18.
   They testified that DeYoung invited them to use the room after
hours and provided keys to the store. The room was equipped with
sofa bed, a large-screen television with a satellite dish that
received pornographic stations and videocassette recorder, the
women testified.
   Though not all of the three cameras in the room were hidden,
DeYoung told the women that the surveillance camera was not
working. The cameras, all aimed at the bed, were set up to activate
when the room's door was opened, Cain said.
   Search warrants for DeYoung's home were issued last month after
one of the women found tapes marked with employees' names. She
played one with her name on it and turned it over to police.
   ``These girls are devastated,'' Cain said. ``They always thought
he was being a nice person.''
