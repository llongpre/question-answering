POOR ELVIS Presley. Only the reputation of Marilyn Monroe has been so sullied 
and bandied about. And Marilyn's been dead 28 years compared with Elvis' 13, so 
there is plenty of time to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The latest invasion comes in the September issue of Penthouse in an interview 
with Earl Greenwood, Elvis' second cousin. Greenwood claims Elvis told him he 
(Greenwood) was the only person he could trust. Does this sound familiar? 
Anyway, Greenwood has written a book (surprise!). Titled "The Boy Who Would Be 
King," coming from Dutton, it purports to tell the whole truth about Elvis, and 
actually, it does seem to present Presley in a more sympathetic light than some 
recent works have. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood tells Penthouse: "Let's face facts. Elvis did have a drug problem, 
and, yes, Elvis did mistreat women. I'm not going to sugarcoat the truth. Elvis 
was a poor boy who suddenly found himself sitting on top of the world. There 
were drugs and booze and women. But Elvis wasn't depraved, nor was he a 
self-indulgent egomaniac. . . . Elvis was a victim of his upbringing. He was a 
poor sharecropper's son who literally became a god to millions of people. He 
was never prepared for all of this." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood's most startling comments in Penthouse have to do with Col. Tom 
Parker, Elvis' manager. Greenwood claims that Parker literally blackmailed 
Presley into giving him 50% of everything the singer pulled in. How? "Let's put 
it this way. We've all heard of the trouble Rob Lowe got into making those sex 
videos. Well, Elvis beat Rob Lowe to the punch." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood says that back in 1960, he and Elvis and several young women 
participated in a five-night sexual debauch that was filmed. Parker got the 
film and used it as a financial lever. Greenwood says the film still exists and 
that Parker probably still has it. 
</P>
<P>
The truth? We won't know that until the raunchy home movie appears somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But when one considers the way Col. Parker mismanaged Elvis's career and the 
meek way that Presley acquiesced to whatever lamebrained movie Parker chose for 
him, it makes some sense.
