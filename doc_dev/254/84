   Large crowds visiting a museum being
prosecuted for showing sexually graphic photographs reveal that for
many residents, this city's clean-cut, conservative reputation is
an unwanted burden.
   City police last week charged the Contemporary Arts Center and
its director with pandering obscenity and other charges when the
museum opened an exhibit by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   The charges seemed characteristic of a city that gained its prim
reputation by closing all of its adult bookstores, banning the sale
or lease of X-rated videos, and starting one of the first citizens'
anti-pornography groups. The city is also a center for the
right-to-life movement.
   ``Cincinnati is a conservative town. We don't have a district
with a lot of streetwalkers and nude shows ... and I don't think
it's the appropriate thing,'' said Fred Lohman, a retired
controller for a tailoring company. ``I'm not for censorship, but I
am for morality.''
   But while anti-pornography advocates have attended rallies
against the exhibit, open pending a court ruling, more than 14,000
people have lined up to see the 175-photograph exhibit since it
opened last Friday. The museum's list of dues-paying patrons has
increased from 1,600 to 2,300 in two weeks.
   ``I think the people in Cincinnati are like people in any
city,'' said Todd Kamm, a social worker and artist. ``It's just
that the people in power in the county ... are pretty archaic.''
   A researcher who surveyed local attitudes in 1988 says
anti-abortion and anti-pornography groups are led by talented
conservative leaders who happen to live in the city.
   ``Cincinnati is no more conservative than the rest of the
nation,'' says Al Tuchfarber, director of the University of
Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research.
   Tuchfarber says anti-pornography groups draw much of their
strength from the traditionally working-class, Roman Catholic west
side of the city, which he said is slightly more conservative than
the east side.
   The city of 370,000 is home to Dr. John Willke, president of
National Right to Life, and the Rev. Jerry Kirk, founder of the
National Coalition Against Pornography. Phoenix financier Charles
H. Keating Jr. grew up in Cincinnati and founded the
anti-pornography group Citizens for Decency Through Law.
   In 1977, a Cincinnati jury convicted Hustler magazine Publisher
Larry Flynt of pandering obscenity. A state appeals court in 1979
ordered a new trial, but charges were dropped in 1985.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibit appeared in Philadelphia; Washington,
D.C.; Chicago; Hartford, Conn., and Berkeley, Calif., without
attracting criminal charges.
   But police and a grand jury raided the Arts Center the day after
the show opened here and charged the center and its director,
Dennis Barrie, with pandering obscenity and using children in
nudity-related material, both misdemeanors.
   A federal judge has barred local authorities from taking further
action until the arraignment Monday in Hamilton County Municipal
Court.
   Two pictures in the exhibit feature nude children and five
depict sex acts. If convicted, Barrie and the museum each would
face fines of $6,000 and Barrie six months in jail.
   The city's last public debate over art came after the 1988
announcement of plans to erect sculptures of winged pigs to
commemorate the Cincinnati's history as a hog-butchering center.
The pigs eventually were unveiled in a city park, although many
argued they were ridiculous.
   Arts Center visitor Michael Moore said the city is doing itself
more harm than good by casting itself as a defender of outdated
standards.
   ``They're pushing for corporations to locate here,'' Moore said.
``I think if I'm the head of a corporation in New York or San
Francisco, I could imagine my employees saying, `Why do I want to
go to Cincinnati?'''
   The Chamber of Commerce has spent $6 million since 1984 on its
``Blue Chip Campaign'' to promote the city's cultural attractions,
and to cite economic reasons for companies to move to Cincinnati.
   The city, however, won't attract the New York City-based College
Art Association national convention in 1995. The group told city
officials it has dropped Cincinnati from consideration because of
the Mapplethorpe dispute.
   Jane Dieckmann, a homemaker who is particularly outraged at the
exhibit's photograph of a seminude girl, said prosecutors shouldn't
worry about criticism in pressing charges against the museum.
   ``I don't care what other cities think,'' Mrs. Dieckmann said.
``I've seen what other cities are like, and I don't think they have
anything more than we have.''
