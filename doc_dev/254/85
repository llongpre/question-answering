   A Bible Belt prosecutor has pulled the
plug on a national X-rated TV channel that beamed movies like
``Ramb-Ohhh! Sex Platoon'' and ``Hardcore Girlfriends'' to
satellite dish owners.
   Civil libertarians are alarmed by the ease with which District
Attorney Jimmy Evans, a Democratic candidate for state attorney
general, drove New York-based Home Dish Satellite Networks Inc. out
of business.
   ``What's happened is some little small town in the South is
setting the standard for the rest of the country,'' said Martin
McCaffery, vice president of the Civil Liberties Union of Alabama.
``It's a horrendous precedent.''
   Evans says adult films have no First Amendment protection.
``These movies not only violate Alabama's obscenity law, they
violate every state obscenity law and the federal obscenity law,''
he said. ``This is a national scandal.''
   He said he began an investigation after parents complained that
their young children were obtaining videotapes of pornographic
movies broadcast on the American Exxxtasy Channel, which was
operated by Home Dish.
   ``I know from experience that hardcore obscenity leads to the
abuse of women and children,'' the Montgomery County prosecutor
said. ``It's bad for our community and bad for our children.''
   The American Exxxtasy Channel transmitted hard-core movies to
home satellite subscribers, but it also operated the Tuxxedo
Channel, a cable channel featuring R-rated ``soft-core'' porn.
   In February, a grand jury in Montgomery returned more than 500
indictments against Home Dish, three other out-of-state companies
and 10 people on charges of distributing hardcore pornography via
satellite into Alabama.
   The other indicted companies _ General Telephone and Electronics
Corp., GTE Spacenet Corp. and U.S. Satellite Inc. _ provided the
satellite capability for American Exxxtasy, but they pleaded
ignorance and cut off Home Dish service.
   The Tuxxedo Channel soon met the same fate. Its broadcasts to
local cable affiliates and dish owners were removed from a
satellite owned by General Motors Corp. after a grand jury returned
another indictment against Home Dish.
   Home Dish, which had reached 1.2 million cable customers and
80,000 satellite-equipped homes, had to lay off its 100 employees.
Its president, Paul Klein, and three other company officials still
face an Alabama extradition request.
   ``I can't fight it,'' said Klein, a former NBC executive. ``I'm
small and very vulnerable. I'm out of business and they're still
trying to extradite me.'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has the
extradition request ``under review,'' his office said.
   ``Without proving that anything is obscene, Jimmy Evans has
succeeded in bankrupting this company and keeping the rest of the
country from seeing these movies in the privacy of their home,''
McCaffery said.
   Klein said his channels, which had 30 satellite customers in
Montgomery and about 600 around the state, were ``meant for
consenting adults.'' But perhaps thousands of others were stealing
the service with illegal descramblers.
   Klein said many Tuxxedo affiliates switched their subscribers to
one of two other soft-core cable channels, Rendezvous and Playboy.
Evans said he knows nothing of those channels, which Montgomery's
only cable company doesn't offer.
   Evans, Montgomery's chief prosecutor since 1973, went after
adult magazines in 1986, while in his first, unsuccessful bid to
become attorney general.
   Playboy and Penthouse magazines fought back, filing a lawsuit
that accused Evans of arbitrarily listing about 50 adult magazines
as obscene and then pressuring Montgomery-area merchants not to
sell them.
   A federal judge sided with the publishers in a sharply worded
order that barred Evans from bringing criminal charges against
merchants for past sales of sexually explicit magazines.
   Despite the order, convenience stores and other merchants
continued to refrain from selling hard-core sex magazines.
   Last year, Evans attacked adult videotapes. Thirteen businesses
were charged with selling and renting allegedly obscene tapes.
About 130 indictments were returned against the businesses, their
managers and other store employees.
   The cases never went to trial. The stores agreed to pay fines
and remove the offending tapes from their shelves.
   Evans denies that he's mixing politics with porn. But he'll be
the first to admit that he's ready to expand his smut-busting
campaign from the confines of Montgomery, a city of 180,000.
   ``When I get in the attorney general's office, there's not going
to be a single hamlet or village or city in this state that's going
to have that kind of stuff for sale,'' he said.
