   People who received unsolicited pornography
sparked an investigation that authorities said resulted in federal
charges against companies responsible for much of the country's
sexually oriented mailings.
   Indictments unsealed Friday in eight states charged 20 people
and 14 companies under a section of federal law that makes it a
crime to use the mails for advertising or distributing obscene
material.
   ``Project Postporn,'' the official moniker for the Justice
Department-Postal Service probe, specifically targeted hard-core
pornography, which depicts actual sexual acts.
   Mailings usually arrived at homes addressed to adults, children
or simply ``resident,'' said Brent Ward, U.S. attorney for Utah and
chairman of the attorney general's subcommittee on obscenity.
   ``They arrive unsolicited in innocuous-looking envelopes in the
homes of unsuspecting people who have never subscribed to
pornography, do not want it in their homes and are never going to
order any obscene material,'' Ward said at a Justice Department
news conference Friday.
   Jack Swagerty, assistant chief postal inspector, said such
mailings had increased in recent years, prompting more than 350,000
people to file postal service forms requesting that they not
receive sexually oriented material though the mail. About 100,000
of them were filed in the last year, he said.
   The investigation began a year ago in response to complaints,
officials said. Ward said it had targeted only ``hard-core
obscenity which the U.S. Supreme Court has held is not protected by
the First Amendment.''
   The Supreme Court's test of obscenity is that the material,
taken as a whole, has to appeal to prurient interest; portray
sexual conduct in a patently offensive way in light of contemporary
community standards; and lack serious artistic, political or
scientific value.
   A 1986 report by Attorney General Edwin Meese's pornography
commission linked hard-core pornography to sex crimes. Ward
restated that view Friday when asked by reporters whether the
material had actually caused any harm.
   ``I think it's an accepted fact that the depiction of explicit
sex acts ... has the effect of conditioning individuals to
committing those acts and conditioning society so that that is
accepted as the norm,'' he said.
   But Barry Lynn, legislative counsel for the American Civil
Liberties Union, denounced that view as ``hysteria'' and said it
conflicted with the First Amendment guaranteeing the right of free
speech.
   ``There isn't any evidence that links adults looking at
pornography to any real crime,'' he said in an interview later.
``It may be grotesque, but much of the stuff is just obviously
consenting adults having sex.''
   Ward said the targeted material depicts sexual acts, ``often in
a context of violence toward women and children, and often
stressing themes such as rape, incest, torture, bondage, child
sexual abuse and bestiality.''
   The officials displayed at the news conference samples of the
advertisements, which included one promoting nine ``full-length
movies'' for $79 featuring ``12 hours of the rawest sex ever
filmed.'' Another advertised ``new bondage videos,'' including
``Captive Co-Eds'' and ``Harem Girls in Bondage.''
   Undercover agents responding to complaints about the material
purchased samples and compiled evidence to search 11 companies, and
then developed evidence on others, officials said. Ward said the
companies represent ``as much as three-fourths of mailings of
sexually oriented material in this country.''
   The companies charged operated under a variety of names and had
a number of other associated companies. Indictments or criminal
complaints were returned in Sioux City, Iowa; Buffalo, N.Y.;
Harrisburg, Pa.; Tallahassee, Fla.; Nashville and Memphis, Tenn.;
Fort Worth, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Spokane, Wash. The
criminal charges were filed in the city where the obscene material
was received, not necessarily where the distributors operated.
