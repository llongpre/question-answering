   Spin magazine announced Monday that each copy of
its November edition will contain a free condom, but said many
distributors and retailers were refusing to accept the magazines.
   Citing the threat of AIDS, Spin editor and publisher Bob
Guccione Jr. said, ``We are making a statement to our young adult
readership. ... It is an immensely important and responsible
statement: that safe sex can save lives.''
   The November issue, which is to arrive on newsstands later this
week, will feature a public service announcement that includes
condoms provided by Carter-Wallace Inc., makers of Trojan condoms,
and instructions on how to use them. The magazine has a monthly
circulation of 140,000.
   Spin, which covers popular music in particular and pop culture
in general, released a list of more than 20 distributors who
refused to handle the magazine because of the condoms.
   ``It is something that will make our magazine very
controversial,'' said Jonathan Marder, a Spin spokesman. ``This
list (of distributors) is expanding rapidly.'' Many, he said, were
drug stores which themselves sell condoms.
   In a letter explaining the move, Guccione said: ``Our inclusion
of the condom is an emphatic message to readers to at least
consider how serious the implications of sexually transmitted
diseases are, and how much sense condoms make. We are not
moralizing, but once again informing.''
   He quoted Surgeon General Everett Koop as calling condoms ``the
best preventive measure against AIDS, besides not having sex and
practicing safe behavior.''
