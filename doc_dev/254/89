   In the country's most sweeping
crackdown on illegal pornography, police have seized more than
200,000 adult sex magazines worth $7.3 million and arrested at
least 18 people, prosecutors said today.
   More than 20,000 of the magazines were copies of Playboy,
Penthouse and Hustler stolen from a U.S. Army base in Seoul,
prosecutors said. The magazines are not available legally in South
Korea, but are sold to U.S. forces through base outlets.
Blackmarket copies sell for $22 to $30 apiece.
   The Seoul District Prosecutors Office said that among
Korean-produced materials in the seizure were 50,000 comic books
depicting explicit sex, 15,000 magazines with erotic pictures and
text, 10,000 pornographic books, and 5,000 sex gadgets and
stimulants.
   Nah Myong-su, 49, and Ahn Dok-jun, 41, who helped run the
warehouse for the U.S. 8th Army in Seoul, were charged with larceny
and illegally handing over to third parties copies of magazines
pilfered from the warehouse since 1983.
   Prosecutor Cho Chung-ung said charges against other people were
for producing and marketing obscene publications and sex gadgets
and illegally dealing in pornographic materials. He said the
investigation into organized criminal rings which specialize in
underground sex was continuing.
   On Wednesday, prosecutors announced the arrest of nine people
including a department store president, a film star and a runner-up
in the Miss Korea pageant for allegedly using illegal drugs in sex
orgies.
   South Korea is a conservative homogeneous society with
old-fashioned values of family, marriage and centuries-old
traditions. Many Koreans are deeply concerned that their country's
increasing affluence and new Western-style consumerism are tearing
at the social fabric.
   The government has stepped up efforts in the past year to weed
out illicit drugs, pornography and prostitution. Arrests have been
made, but such activities continue to thrive.
