   Ten years after the film ``Caligula'' was seized
by city vice detectives, the controversial photographs of Robert
Mapplethorpe will arrive next month with the impassioned backing of
the Institute of Contemporary Art.
   Far from being banned in Boston, Mapplethorpe's work will
receive extra security, the director of the institute said Monday,
to ensure that it is properly showcased in the city where
Mapplethorpe died of AIDS a year ago.
   The exhibit will also receive corporate sponsorship for the
first time on the tour, from Phoenix Media@Communications Group.
   Despite threats of protest from a Catholic lay group, ICA
director David Ross said the museum wouldn't omit the seven
sexually graphic photographs in the exhibit. The collection of 160
photographs, which includes still lifes, portraits and nudes, will
be on exhibit from Aug. 1 to Oct 4.
   ``We promised him we would do what we could to make sure the
exhibit was shown according to his wishes,'' said Ross. ``Robert
Mapplethorpe was a friend of mine and someone I knew for 15 years.
We're showing this because we believe Robert Mapplethorpe was an
important artist. His work spoke to the tenor of our times, as all
good artists do.''
   To edit out the controversial works would be ``egregious,'' Ross
said. ``He was an artist whose career deserved an entire
retrospective.''
   Philip Lawler of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights said the art institute can ``count on some strong
demonstration of outrage.''
   Lawler and former Boston Mayor John Collins have called on Mayor
Raymond Flynn to stop the exhibit. Flynn aides have said the mayor
will not block the show.
   ``Caligula,'' a sexually graphic 1980 film about ancient Rome,
was the last casualty of the legendary censorship that led to the
phrase ``Banned in Boston.'' Since the last century, at least 16
books have been banned in Boston, according to the American Library
Association. Casualties included works by Theodore Dreiser, Ernest
Hemingway and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
   Controversy has trailed the Mapplethorpe exhibit in its tour
around the country. Last month an Ohio judge ruled that an art
gallery and its director must stand trial for displaying two
Mapplethorpe photographs that included nude or semi-nude children.
   A county grand jury indicted the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati and director Dennis Barrie on April 7, the day the
exhibit opened.
   Ross called the Cincinnati indictment a ``very sad event. It's
not a good day for museum directors when they're hauled off to
court for doing what museum directors have been doing for years.''
   The Boston show concludes an 18-month tour that included stops
in Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Hartford, Conn.,
Berkeley, Calif., and Cincinnati.
