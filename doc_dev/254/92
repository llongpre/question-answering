   Six years ago, a small-town Minnesota girl
left home for Hollywood. But her dreams of stardom turned into an
X-rated nightmare of porn movies and cocaine addiction, and two
years later, she committed suicide.
   Her mother, Karen Applegate, is still searching for answers in
the March 21, 1984, death of her 20-year-old daughter, Colleen. She
and her family cooperated with Hollywood in a television movie
based on Colleen's life in hopes that it might prevent similar
tragedies.
   ``Shattered Innocence,'' Wednesday night on CBS, depicts the
final years of Miss Applegate, who left her Farmington home in
March 1982, posed nude for magazine photos and soon became porn
movie star Shauna Grant.
   Her name and hometown were changed in the film, but her mother
said: ``The whole mess is true. The basic story is true. And why? I
don't know.''
   While the mother said she was generally satisfied with the film,
she felt the horror of the worlds of pornography and cocaine
addiction were soft-pedaled.
   At the peak of her career, Shauna Grant made 30 X-rated movies
in one year and had film sex with about 40 men. The movie, however,
gave the impression that Grant made only a few films.
   ``The producers originally had a dramatization closer to the
gritty details, but it had to be softened because of prime-time
television,'' production representative Karen Ocamb said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles.
   ``You get the idea of what the world of pornography is all
about, what it does to the individual is that it kills her.''
   ``Shattered Innocence'' tells of a high school cheerleader who
is bored and restless with her life in Banning, Kan., and after
graduation heads for the bright lights and glitter of Hollywood.
   Dazzled by the quick money to be made in nude modeling, up to
$2,000 a session for national magazines, she soon went for even
bigger purses offered by porn films. She then started using cocaine
to lose weight.
   Throughout the film, she maintains contact with her family. Her
mother loves her but doesn't excuse or condone her behavior.
   ``It is very difficult for the family. They try to intervene but
she wants the family to love her on her terms, not theirs,'' Ocamb
said.
   After briefly giving up her pornographic movie career, but being
unable to kick the cocaine addiction, the young woman portrayed by
actress Jonna Lee is about to re-enter the world of pornography
when she kills herself.
   ``The mother asks, `Why did this happen?' That's basically what
the film asks,'' said Ocamb. ``There are no answers. Everyone in
every family needs to ask this question. How did a cheerleader
become a porno star and commit suicide?''
   The movie was made because Colleen Applegate's story is
representative of so many young people, Ocamb said.
   ``There are a lot of kids who come from Farmington, Minnesota,
or Banning, Kansas. They're just immature and irresponsible and
they think they can come to Hollywood and become a star overnight
or they'll just `find something.'
   ``As we know, they wind up on the streets,'' Ocamb said.
   The Applegates _ Colleen had three younger sisters and one
younger brother _ cooperated with the producers in hopes the movie
might help someone else, said the mother, who is portrayed by
actress Melinda Dillon.
   ``For people out there who think that it's exploiting her and
exploiting ourselves, then they should be very grateful because
then they can't relate to it,'' she said.
   ``There are many out there who can relate to it, and those are
the ones I hope it helps.''
