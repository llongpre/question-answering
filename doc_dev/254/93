   Some American church leaders say the movie
industry is pulling a deceptive ruse on the public, making the bad
look good by labeling the ugly with a pretty name.
   Such is the general assessment by a broad range of churches,
Protestant, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic, of the new system
under which previously X-rated movies now are rated NC-17.
   Terming the change by the Motion Picture Association of America
a surrender to ``sexually exploitative material,'' officials of the
U.S. Catholic Conference and the National Council of Churches said:
   ``It is an arrogant and ill-advised decision which deeply
affects the public good. It was made in isolation, without public
consultation. The change is neither in the public interest nor in
the best interest of the industry. ...
   ``Changing the name of the `X' category does not change the
nature of the material.''
   Southern Baptists, the largest denomination not in the council,
also endorsed the joint protest. The Rev. Richard D. Land, head of
that denomination's social-concerns agency, said:
   ``The change has all the appearances of watering down an
effective wall that helped people stay away from pornographic
materials.''
   Religious publications contended the change camouflages the
nature of the formerly ``X'' category so movie theaters would be
more apt to show such films.
   It gives movie-makers ``a `respectable' category for their
excesses,'' says the Rev. James M. Wall, editor of the ecumenical
weekly, The Christian Century. ``The restraint is removed.''
   Wall, a movie buff and chairman of the National Council of
Churches' Media Ethics and Advocacy Committee, said the change
basically is ``about what kind of world our children will live
in.''
   The Catholic Messenger, diocesan weekly in Davenport, Iowa, says
the ``marketplace now has more freedom than it had two weeks ago to
disturb your children's growth.''
   The editorial adds that films of ``sickening violence and the
debased or irreponsibile or glamorized fantasy use of sex'' will
now be ``much more widely distributed and shown.''
   The church critics aren't advocating censorship or government
curbs on films, warning that the change itself will provide
ammunition for ``thoe who already are calling for regulation of
the media.''
   ``That is unfortunate, because a voluntary system of
self-regulation that skirts constitutional concerns, yet affords at
least a minimum of protection to the public, is workable,'' the
interchurch statement says.
   The movie industry contends that the ``X'' rating has come to be
understood as indicating only pornographic films and thus has
downgraded some serious, adult films of artistic merit.
   Most theater chains don't show X-rated films and most newspapers
won't take advertising for them. Some newspapers, such as the
Birmingham (Ala.) News, extended the advertising ban to NC-17
films.
   ``Smut is still smut,'' the News editorialized.
   In the new system, films considered of some merit but whose
sexual or violence portrayals exceed limits for an ``R'' rating are
to be given the new ``NC-17'' rating, meaning no children under 17
are to be admitted.
   The ``R'' or restricted rating, meaning admission of youngsters
only if accompanied by a parent, is continued, with explanations
provided on why a film is placed in that category, such as its
depiction of sexual activity, violence, profanity, drug use or
suicide.
   However, no explanations will be given for ``NC-17'' films.
   The motion picture association said they would ``continue to be
evaluated as X-rated films have been in the past, that is, on the
basis that most parents would agree'' such films should not be
viewed by youngsters.
   Wall says ``poor enforcement policies'' of theaters indicate the
NC-17 age restriction won't be effective. Already, he writes, ``R''
pictures are ``easy for 13-year-olds to see, with or without their
parents.''
   James Arnold, a movie critic for many Catholic publications,
says much depends on theaters enforcing the specified restrictions,
but ``their track record is not encouraging.''
   The first movie to get the new NC-17 rating, ``Henry and June,''
features lovemaking between two women.
   In the new situation, Ted Baehr, publisher of Atlanta-based
Movieguide, was organizing a conference in Washington Nov. 16 of
religious and other groups to promote community-based rating boards
for movies.
   He said such boards are frightening to film industry officials.
   The joint Protestant-Catholic statement suggested similar steps,
urging local congregations and others in each community to
``monitor closely'' enforcement of restrictions for the ``newly
contrived NC-17 rating'' and others.
   Members of the Association of Theater Owners were asked to to
refuse to book NC-17 movies and newspapers were asked to reject ads
for such movies.
