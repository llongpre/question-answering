   Defense lawyers asked a judge to dismiss an
indictment against an art gallery showing photographs by the late
Robert Mapplethorpe, saying the gallery is immune from Ohio
obscenity laws.
   The lawyers on Thursday also asked Hamilton County Judge David
J. Albanese to dismiss the charges on grounds that prosecutors
unfairly singled out the Contemporary Arts Center gallery and its
director, Dennis Barrie.
   Marc Mezibov, who represents Barrie, said that even if seven
photographs cited in the indictment are found obscene, Ohio law
exempts material exhibited for a ``proper purpose'' by artistic and
educational institutions.
   ``Do you think the U.S. Supreme Court would buy that?'' Albanese
asked during a three-hour hearing.
   ``Oh, absolutely,'' Mezibov said. ``What these laws are all
about is an attempt to eliminate commercial, hard-core pornography.
The CAC is not in the profit-making business. They are an
educational institution.''
   Senior assistant city Prosecutor Frank Prouty disagreed.
   ``The issue here is not their status. The issue is whether what
they displayed is obscene,'' he said.
   Albanese did not say when he would rule on the defense request
or the contention that prosecutors singled out the gallery.
   At least some of the pictures in the indictment are available in
books at the University of Cincinnati and on display at the
Cincinnati Art Museum, said H. Louis Sirkin, who represents the
Arts Center.
   ``I'm not here to get these institutions in trouble. I'm here to
point out that law enforcement officers were well aware that the
material was available,'' he said.
   The arguments by Mezibov and Sirkin came after Albanese let the
city amend the indictment to add references to U.S. Supreme Court
obscenity and child pornography standards.
   The judge granted Prouty's request that the indictment allege
that the two pictures featuring children in the 175-photograph
exhibit include a ``lewd exhibition or graphic focus on genitals.''
   Albanese also agreed to have the indictment allege that five
other pictures depicting sex acts meet Supreme Court requirements
that obscene material violate community standards, depict clearly
offensive sexual conduct and lack artistic value.
   ``It's clear that the state can amend that charge so long as ...
the defendants have a chance to prepare for a trial,'' the judge
said.
   Barrie and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity and
using children in material involving nudity. If convicted, they
face $6,000 in fines and Barrie faces six months in jail.
   Their lawyers had argued that the indictment accused them of no
crime, referring only to depictions of sex acts and nude children,
which are not automatically obscene.
   Albanese also rejected a defense request to see a transcript
from the county grand jury that returned the charges April 7.
   Defense lawyers said the indictment doesn't indicate whether
grand jurors were told of Supreme Court standards that pictures
found to have artistic value can't be ruled obscene.
   Albanese refused to violate the traditional confidentiality of
the grand jury, noting that a county Common Pleas Court judge had
reviewed the transcript before refusing a similar request last
month.
