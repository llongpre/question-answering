   A former television preacher says he told a grand
jury he had sex with Jim Bakker three times and arranged the fateful
tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahn at Bakker's urging,
according to a magazine interview.
   John Wesley Fletcher, who appeared on ``The PTL Club'' television
program from the mid-1970s to 1981, described Bakker as a bisexual
who openly lusted after the show's young male camera operators.
   ``I was Jim Bakker's male prostitute,'' he said in the interview
for January's Penthouse magazine.
   Fletcher is the second man to say publicly that he had sex with
Bakker. In September, former PTL official Jay Babcock said he had
told the grand jury of a sexual encounter with Bakker.
   Fletcher said in the interview released Sunday that he related
the sexual encounters to the federal grand jury investigating
charges that Bakker, Bakker's wife, Tammy, and PTL aide David
Taggart illegally spent contributions to the ministry on their
lavish lifestyles.
   The grand jury, meeting in Charlotte, N.C., apparently began
deliberations today after a 16-month investigation.
   Among other things, witnesses have said the jury also is
investigating whether ministry funds were used to pay $364,000 in
hush money to Ms. Hahn or to entice aides to grant Bakker homosexual
favors. The jury has been examining allegations of wire, tax and
mail fraud.
   Federal prosecutors were in the panel's meeting room for nearly
two hours this morning before returning to their offices and leaving
the grand jury alone.
   Bakker, the PTL founder, has denied in a sworn deposition that he
ever had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and has denied
charges of financial wrongdoing.
   Two attorneys for Bakker, Jim Toms and Ryan Hovis, issued this
statement Sunday in response to the Penthouse report:
   ``Sadly, some so-called journalists continue to exploit human
tragedy by stories such as the one we now understand to be in
Penthouse about Mr. Fletcher.
   ``He has lost his ministry and finances and recently has been
hospitalized. We would not want to further add to his difficulties
by commenting on the story, and simply point to where it is being
published.''
   Toms has said he believes it is only a matter of time before the
grand jury indicts Bakker.
   Fletcher said he participated in homosexual activity with Bakker
only reluctantly.
   Fletcher said he related allegations about Bakker's sexual
encounters to officials of the Assemblies of God before the
Pentecostal denomination defrocked Bakker in May 1987.
   Fletcher was removed from the Assemblies of God ministry in 1981
amid accusations of homosexual activity, the magazine said.
   Penthouse reported that Fletcher's psychiatrist confirmed he
spent a month in a hospital last spring recovering from a suicide
attempt.
   Fletcher blamed himself in the interview for setting off PTL's
sex-and-hush money scandal by introducing Hahn to Bakker, even
though he said he did so at Bakker's request. Hahn has charged that
Bakker and Fletcher raped her in a Florida hotel room; Fletcher said
in the interview that she willingly had sex.
   Fletcher also charged that Bakker often threatened suicide to
manipulate those around him and was cynical about fund-raising.
   ``Some of the little old ladies he called `Grandma Grunts,' like
here comes another pocketbook,'' Fletcher said.
