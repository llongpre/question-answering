   The sexual revolution had arrived at a small
knick-knack stand outside Moscow's Kiev Train Station but not to the
liking of a middle-aged woman.
   ``What a disgrace!'' she snapped, shaking her finger at the
girlie photos that were attacting a crowd.
   ``Why? They're only Soviet women,'' the vendor retorted.
   ``No, they're not Soviet women. Soviet women are always
covered,'' she declared, and marched on.
   ``Because of people like that, Soviets are full of taboos,'' the
vendor shouted after her.
   The exchange typified the small storm of controversy these days
over the wave of what is being called ``erotica'' _ a rash of
posters, playing cards and calendars that would raise no eyebrows
these days in the West.
   A reporter for the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in
Novosibirsk was outraged that kiosks in that Siberian city were
plastered with photos of naked women ``aimed at the dubious tastes
of young and aging sex maniacs.''
   Such ``decadence and vulgarity'' compromise the openness fostered
by the Kremlin's reforms, Yuri Solomenko wrote.
   On the contrary, argued Natalia Rtishcheva in an article
published in the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta supporting steamier
love scenes.
   ``Finally, we've proven that Soviet people have a sexual
imagination,'' she wrote. ``And our men and women do occasionally
get into bed intending to do more than read a tome of their favorite
poet.''
   All pornography has long been banned in the Soviet Union,
although a black market in smuggled videos and magazines flourishes.
Love scenes in Soviet movies never went beyond staid embraces, and
the heroic figures of official Soviet art were always decorously
clothed.
   Rtishcheva said her mother started to cry after watching ``Little
Vera,'' the movie that shocked Soviet viewers last year with a sex
scene that would barely get an American movie an R rating.
   ``There was nothing to comfort her with,'' she wrote in the
literary journal. ``The times of shy kisses and the embarrassed
ladies of the comedies of the prewar period have truly passed.''
   In August, the hot movie in Moscow was ``Interdevochka''
(``Intergirl''), a sympathetic portrayal of a prostitute who plies
her trade for foreign currency, marries a Swede and escapes her
sordid hotel life, only to be tortured by nostalgia and her past
reputation.
   Crowds pack the theater to see hooker-with-heart Tanya Zaitseva
(played by Yelena Yakovleva) strut in skimpy underwear and suffer
the lucrative advances of a Japanese businessman.
   The Kremlin's new tolerance along with its economic reforms
brought about the surge of soft-porn. The main producers of
flesh-shot postcards, posters and calendars are cooperatives, the
private businesses created to fill gaps in consumer demand.
   The producers sensed a hot market and turned out nude-with-snake
posters available around Moscow and girlie playing cards on sale
next to kitsch paintings at the capital's main art fair at Izmailovo
Park.
   Artists at Izmailovo and along the Arbat pedestrian mall are also
turning out a great many idealized nudes that would look equally at
home on black velvet at an American flea market.
   The vendor outside the Kiev Train Station copies pictures from
Western skin magazines and pastes them to cardboard-and-felt wallets
that he can then sell for a hefty $13. People complain about the
prices, he said, but they buy.
   In another example of the new Soviet permissiveness, Moscow's
Arbat restaurant features male and female dancers with nothing but
G-strings in a suggestive pas-de-deux. On a recent evening, the show
was in such demand diners could gain entrance only by bribing the
doorman.
   Nudity in the theater is also on the rise, and Leningrad now has
a modern dance group that residents refer to as ``The Erotic
Ballet.''
   The trend of sexual glasnost (openness) has its legitimate side
as well: It answers not only the hunger for sexual excitement but
also the need for basic, Masters-and-Johnson-type sexual information.
   A recent article in the popular medical journal Your Health
provides graphic tips on female sexuality and how couples can
improve their bedroom lives. Its pragmatic approach bears little
resemblance to Soviet health magazines' traditional reliance on
vague abstractions about ``socialist families'' when giving sexual
advice.
   Even works by Sigmund Freud, long condemned as bourgeois
reactionary ideology and left unpublished, are coming out in record
number, printed both by cooperatives and by the state publishing
committee Goskomizdat.
   Although there is still virtually no sex education as such, a
powerful publicity campaign against AIDS is under way.
   A recent ``Interdevochka'' screening was preceded by a
hard-hitting documentary on AIDS aimed at young people. But it did
not offer any hints on how to obtain condoms and disposable needles,
which are in such short supply they are in demand on the black
market.
