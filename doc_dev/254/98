   A stripper who said she performed sex acts while
television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart watched denied Monday that she
made up her story to cash in on publicity surrounding a similar
story last year.
   Catherine Mary Kampen said she received anonymous offers of hush
money to stop publication of the allegations, which appeared last
week in Penthouse magazine, and received threats before and after
publication.
   Swaggart said last week there was no truth to the story and
Kampen's employer called it a ``pornographic fairy tale'' invented
for financial gain.
   ``Every word that's written in this magazine is true,'' Kampen
declared Monday at a news conference.
   She and a magazine spokeswoman declined to say how much she
received for her cooperation, but Kampen said, ``It was such a small
sum of money that it really is inconsequential.''
   Swaggart last February confessed to an undisclosed sin involving
a prostitute and was later defrocked by the Assemblies of God
ministry.
   She said she offered to tell her story to reporter Art Harris for
free, and did not receive the money until long after she talked to
him in the spring of 1988.
   ``If I was going to make something up, to cash in on something, I
surely wouldn't have made this up,'' she said at a news conference
at Penthouse offices, noting that the story ``does not exactly put
me in a good light.''
