   A day-care center owner who
allegedly took nude pictures of children in his care has been
hospitalized with a slashed wrist after an apparent suicide
attempt, police said.
   John Shaver, 56, was admitted as a psychiatric patient and
listed in fair condition Friday at Broward General Medical Center
after being found in a hotel bathtub with his right wrist cut, said
police spokesman Ott Cefkin.
   Meanwhile, no evidence of physical abuse was found Friday in the
first of 14 children scheduled for medical and psychological exams
after their parents identified their pictures out of 200-300 nude
photos found at Shaver's house, one official said.
   Six children visited the county's Sexual Assault Treatment
Center Friday and none had been sexually assaulted, said center
director Joanne Richter. Eight more children were scheduled for
tests today.
   The pictures, which do not depict sex acts or sexual poses, show
the children wet or in a wading pool and often covered with finger
paint, Cefkin said. More parents are expected to view the pictures
next week.
   Shaver, released on $5,000 bond Wednesday after his arrest
Sunday, admits owning the pictures that police confiscated but does
not consider them pornography. He faces five counts of possessing
child pornography for magazines found at his home, just across the
street from his Rainbow Learning Center.
   Possessing child pornography is a third-degree felony in Florida
and punishable by a maximum five-year prison sentence, said Dave
Casey of the Fort Lauderdale State Attorney's office.
   Shaver, who checked into the Guest Quarters Hotel Thursday, was
found Friday in the tub dressed only in shorts. His right wrist had
been cut with a serrated knife blade. In the room, police found
seven empty 1-ounce liquor bottles and two notes.
   One note reiterated his denial that he took nude photos of
children, and said it was easier to kill himself than deal with the
situation, Cefkin said. The second note apologized to the hotel
staff for the mess he would leave.
   Police also found a copy of the search warrant of his home and a
printout of his money-market account, which showed Shaver was
``quite wealthy,'' Cefkin said.
   The children identified in the photos reported to the Sexual
Assault Treatment Center for medical tests and interviews, director
Richter said. The medical tests are ``mostly to alleviate the fears
of the parents, and rule out the possibility of actual sexual
abuse,'' she said.
   Although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under
the law, they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against
Shaver if the evidence meets that criteria, Cefkin said.
   ``Our primary interest is the children,'' he said. ``We're not
going to subject a child to the criminal justice system if it's not
warranted.''
   Broward County officials shut down Shaver's day-care center
Thursday, contending Shaver ``lacked good moral character.''
   Shaver opened the day-care center in 1985 for children ages 3 to
5. Thirty children, mostly 4 and 5, attended the center at the time
it closed, and about 200 have attended since it opened.
   In 1984 in Hawaii, Shaver pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge
of operating a day-care center without a license. The plea came a
year after the state of Hawaii revoked his license amid allegations
that he fondled several young girls at his center. He was never
criminally charged and Shaver denied any wrongdoing.
