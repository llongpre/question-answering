  [Text] Representatives of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) visited Burmese refugee camps 
in Tak yesterday as part of a plan to repatriate 60,000 Burmese 
nationals from 13 refugee camps. 
  The vice chairman of the Karen Refugee Committee guided 
UNHCR's Ruprecht Arnim and three other representatives on a tour 
of two refugee camps at Ban Huai Kralok in Mae Sot and Maokoe in 
Ban Phopphra. 
  At the Huai Kralok camp, Mr Arnim told the refugees the 
UNHCR 
was considering a repatriation programme for the 60,000 Burmese 
nationals living in Thailand. 
  He said his visit was to study the living conditions of the 
refugees, conditions he described as abnormal. 
  "The UNHCR is trying to work out a coordinated plan with 
Thai 
and Burmese officials to facilitate this `homecoming' and in 
seeking a permanent solution to the refugees' problems," he said. 
  Mr Arnim also said a central committee to supervise the 
repatriation would have to be created to guarantee the returning 
Burmese would not be harmed or come under undue pressure from 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). 
  This group of UNHCR representatives has been in Thailand on 
a 
National Security Command-approved mission since June 12. They 
are to visit refugees camps in Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son and Tak. 
  The group will meet with Third Army officials in Phitsanulok 
today. 
  The Third Army Task Force 34 Coordinator in Mae Sot, Col 
Phongsak Suksawat, said both Thailand and Burma had already 
started repatriation talks at the Thai-Burmese Border Committee 
level last month. The talks were headed by First Army commander 
Lt-Gen Chettha Thanacharo and Burmese South Eastern Force 
commander Maj-Gen Khet Sein. 
  Col Phongsak said the committee assigned local Thai and 
Burmese officials to consider the repatriation of the 60,000 
Burmese refugees from the 13 camps along the border. 
  The majority of the refugees are Karen who escaped Burma 
from 
the area under Karen National Union [KNU] control during the May 
16 SLORC drive against the KNU. 
  The Task Force coordinator said there was no longer fighting 
along the Tak border. 
  "SLORC and the KNU have agreed to formal peace talks," he 
said. 
  He also said 3,000 Karens had been repatriated safely and 
had 
been living without disturbance from SLORC for over a month.
