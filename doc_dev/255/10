   Thailand has forced Burmese students to
return home despite the possibility of detention and harsh treatment
by the military government, Amnesty International reported.
   Thailand forced the repatriation Jan. 6 of 22 students who fled
Burma after the bloody military coup in September, the London-based
human rights group said in a statement received by telex Wednesday
at the Associated Press office in Bangkok. It was dated Tuesday.
   Thai officials have denied forcing students back across the
border and Burma claims those who return are treated well.
   Amnesty International said its concern was based ``on increasing
evidence that many political prisoners arrested for having been
actively involved in the March-September uprising have been held
incommunicado without charge or trial since their arrest and that
some of them have been subjected to torture or other forms of severe
treatment.''
   It reported ``information that Thant Zin, who was repatriated
last Dec. 26 with some 80 other students, is said to have been
arrested after arriving in his hometown of Mergui in Burma's
southern Tenasserim Division. He has apparently been held
incommunicado ... and his current whereabouts are unknown.''
   Among the 22 returned Jan. 6, Amnesty said, were Sai Myon Wyn Tun
and Kyai Moe, both 23, who helped lead the August and September
demonstrations for democracy in their hometown of Taunggyi in Shan
state.
   Amnesty said they were among 36 students of the Shan ethnic
minority rounded up by Thai police two weeks ago in Mae Hong Son
province on the Burma border.
   ``They are said to have repeatedly expressed fears for their
safety and to have petitioned the Thai authorities not to be
returned to Burma and eventually went on a hunger strike,'' the
statement said.
   ``They are understood to have been forced to board a plane from
Tak airport on Jan. 6, 1989, by Thai army personnel. The 14
remaining students are believed to be still held in Tak airport,
pending similar repatriation.''
   Reporters who accompanied the 22 on the flight from Tak to
Rangoon, the Burmese capital, said some expressed concern for their
safety in Burma and distrust of the government. Some carried
placards saying, ``We love democracy and human rights.''
   Thousands of students, who were at the forefront of a nationwide
campaign for democracy, fled to Thai border areas controlled by
ethnic Burmese insurgent groups after Gen. Saw Maung, the Burmese
military commander, seized power Sept. 18 and his troops killed
hundreds of unarmed demonstrators. Thai officials have said about
7,000 young Burmese remain.
   Thailand initially promised the students temporary asylum, but
Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, chief of the army, reached an agreement
with Saw Maung on repatriation when he visited Burma on Dec. 14. Two
processing centers were established, in northern Tak province and
north of Bangkok.
   On Tuesday, Thailand's Cabinet extended the deadline for students
to return home to March 31. Chavalit has proposed that any who miss
the deadline be charged with illegal entry and sent back, according
to a report Wednesday in the Thai newspaper The Nation.
   In a separate document received Wednesday, Amnesty reported
allegations that Burmese soldiers killed some students who returned
outside the formal repatriation program. Other sources have made
similar charges but their validity cannot be determined.
   The 14-page report, called ``The 18 September 1988 Military
Takeover and Its Aftermath,'' said:
   ``In one reported instance, nine returning students were arrested
by government troops in the Burmese town of Kwathaung .. . on 19
November and taken to a military camp. There four ... were allegedly
beheaded by soldiers while the five others who had been held managed
to escape.
   ``In another reported instance, 15 university students, including
three women, were allegedly executed ... after they were captured in
the forest, on their way back home from border areas. The three
young women were allegedly gang-raped by soldiers.''
