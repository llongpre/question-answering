  [Text] Chiang Rai -- The Border Patrol Police and Army 
Region 3 troops have pushed back about 300 Burmese who tried to 
flee fighting by entering Thailand through the border pass at 
Mae Sai. The Burmese refugees, mostly males, said they escaped 
from the Burmese army because it tried to force them to 
transport artillery over difficult terrain to fire on drug 
warlord Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA). 
  Sources said all the Burmese have been sent to a temporary 
refugee centre at Wat Wianghom in Mae Sai District. The 
officials said repatriation would be possible only after the 
fighting on the Burmese side had ceased. 
  Chiang Rai Governor Khamron Bunchoet said it was not 
necessary at this time to close the commercial passage between 
Mae Sai and Burma's Thachilek town, reasoning that the battle 
had not threatened the people living in the border town or in 
the surrounding areas. Last year the Burmese government closed 
the border point which resulted in a downturn in the tremendous 
volume of trade between both countries, he said. 
  In the latest development, the battle between the Burmese 
National Army and Khun Sa's MTA, which is sited 40 kilometres 
south of Burma's Thachilek town and about 20 kilometres from Ban 
Hua Kham in Mae Fa Luang district, yesterday continued for the 
fourth day.
