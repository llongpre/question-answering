   Burmese troops crossed into Thailand
while launching intense attacks on a rebel camp inside Burma and
nine soldiers were killed, Thai border patrol police said Saturday.
   The Burmese have failed to capture the Karen rebels' base, Kaw
Moo Ra, after four days of stepped up fighting that has included
intense mortar and rocket barrages, said police officers who
requested anonymity.
   The Karen are among a dozen ethnic minorities fighting Burma's
military government for greater autonomy. In recent months, Burmese
troops have overrun a string of Karen bases along the frontier.
   About 200 Burmese troops crossed the Moei River, which marks the
frontier, and entered Wang Kaew village Friday to attack Kaw Moo Ra
from the Thai side of the border, according to the police in nearby
Mae Sot, 250 miles northwest of the capital, Bangkok, and 140 miles
east of the Burmese capital, Rangoon.
   The Burmese withdrew from the village Saturday after warnings
from the Thai military in the area. They left the bodies of nine of
their soldiers. Thai police said they took into custody one wounded
Burmese military officer.
   About 500 ethnic Karen civilians have fled into Thailand from
the besieged rebel base.
   Fighting between Burmese troops and another rebel group of the
Mon ethnic minority was reported continuing around Three Pagoda
Pass, which Burma's troops overran late last week.
   Several thousand civilians from that border town also have fled
into Thai territory.
   The government of Gen. Saw Maung put down a nationwide
pro-democracy uprising nearly two years ago, killing hundreds of
people. The resistance forces now include students who sought
refuge in rebel camps following the crackdown.
   The Karens, one of the largest of the diverse ethnic groups
fighting the Burmese government, have resisted the integration of
their Karen state into the Union of Burma since Rangoon gained
independence from Britain in 1948.
