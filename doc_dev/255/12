   About 500 Burmese government troops
clashed with Thai soldiers today after crossing the border to
launch an attack on a Karen rebel stronghold, a Thai officer said.
   He said a group of 400 soldiers crossed the Moei River boundary
into Mae Sot's Ban Wangkaew village, which has been evacuated due
to the fighting, to set up heavy weapons to shell the camp. Some of
them also seized control of a road about five miles from Mae Sot,
he said.
   Thai forces fired into the village, but the Burmese soldiers
still remained in the evening, said the officer, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A 64-year-old Thai man was wounded in the clash, and Thai
soldiers and paramilitary personnel were sent in as reinforcements.
   The officer said Thai forces fired artillery rounds as warnings
to a second group of 100 Burmese soldiers who crossed into another
area of Mae Sot.
   ``They are attacking across the river and fighting us from the
Thai side,'' said a Karen official who asked not to be named. He
said the offensive was the largest since 1977 and that thousands of
Karen civilians had fled to Thailand.
   The Thai officer said other Burmese troops perched on two hills
in Burma continued attacking Kaw Moo Ra with heavy shells today,
setting much of the Burmese camp ablaze. Fierce fighting was
reported in one part of the camp.
   He estimated that 1,200 guerrillas were defending the camp
against about 3,000 soldiers.
   Thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels, but the
Bangkok government has sent top level delegations to Burma to
discuss the situation. Last year, the military government in Burma
killed hundreds of Burmese during widepsread demonstrations for
democracy.
   After putting down the demonstrations, the Burmese army renewed
its battle with the Karens, who began their revolt in 1949, the
year after Burma achieved independence from Great Britain. The
rebels said at the time that the government reneged on its promise
of more autonomy for ethnic minorities.
   The Karen National Union has an estimated 4,000 combatants and
is the largest of the 10 ethnic insurgent groups in the National
Democratic Front.
   Kaw Moo Ra is in Karen State and is 140 miles east of Rangoon,
the Burmese capital. Government forces began shelling it Thursday,
two days after overrunning the major rebel base of Wangkha, about
two miles to the south.
   Wangkha was the fifth Karen stronghold to be captured by army
units since the government launched a bloody dry season offensive
in October. A government spokesman said Friday in Rangoon that at
least 43 rebels were killed in the battle for Wangkha. He said 35
soldiers were killed and 95 wounded.
   The five captured camps are in a 75-mile arc hugging the border
along Mae Sot district in Thailand's northern province of Tak.
   Thai officials say the Burmese offensive has disrupted the
cross-border black market trade that provided the Karens with funds
for their insurgency.
