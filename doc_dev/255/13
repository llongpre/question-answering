   Burmese refugees who fled a military
crackdown reached a camp in northwestern Thailand on Thursday,
preparing to return home, officials said.
   The first group of 56 students and Buddhist monks traveled to the
repatriation camp at Tak, provincial and police officials said.
Doctors at the camp, which opened Wedesday, said more than half of
them had malaria.
   Tak is about 50 miles from the Burmese border.
   Burma's official Radio Rangoon said the students would be sent to
Bangkok, where the Burmese Embassy has arranged to fly them to Burma.
   After the Sept. 18 military coup in Burma, thousands of students
traveled to anti-government guerrilla bases along the Thai border,
seeking haven or military training.
   The agreement to open the camp was reached in talks last week
between Burmese leader Gen. Saw Maung and Thailand's army chief,
Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the first foreign dignitary to visit
Burma since the coup.
