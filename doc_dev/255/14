  [Text] Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of 
the National Security Council [NSC], talks about the problem of 
Burmese refugees fleeing the danger of war into Thailand's 
border areas since 1984. He says there are about 50,000 of them 
in Tak Province, 10,000 in Kanchanaburi Province, and several 
thousands in Mae Hong Son and Prachuap Khirikhan Provinces. 
Under the original plan, these people will be sent back to 
Burma once the situation has improved and there is no fighting. 
But they have not been sent back yet because they claim that 
the situation in Burma is never safe for them. 
  The NSC deputy secretary general said these Burmese refugees 
have been here for more than 10 years now. They received help 
from seven or eight private organizations, the so-called NGO 
[preceding word in English], which have been allowed to carry 
out operations without strict control by Thai authorities. Some 
of those NGO officials are involved in political activities with 
the refugees. Certain organizations used Thailand, which has 
diplomatic relations with Burma, as a transit point for certain 
leaders of the resistance ethnic minority groups to leave for a 
third country where they can launch resistance activities 
against the Burmese Government. Such an act could affect 
relations between Thailand and Burma as well as security along 
the Thai border. 
  In order to promptly control these refugees, Khachatphai 
Burutphat said that concerned authorities would form an 
apparatus in order to oversee these people. At the beginning, 
existing officials will be told to take strict action against 
them. The new agency to be set up will deal with these refugees 
based on humanitarian principles, but it will not permit them to 
engage in any kind of activities in violation of Thai law or 
activities which will affect security along the Thai-Burmese 
border.
