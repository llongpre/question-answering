<HEAD>Burmese Students Fly Home, Officials Deny Forced Repatriations</HEAD>

   A group of 76 Burmese students flew home
Thursday from Thailand, where the prime minister was reported to
reject charges of earlier forced repatriations.
   The latest return brought to 260 the number who have come home
since the repatriation program began Dec. 26, Thai officials said.
   Thousands of students, at the forefront of pro-democracy protests
through much of last year, fled to Thai border areas controlled by
anti-government guerrillas after Gen. Saw Maung seized power in a
coup Sept. 18 and his troops killed hundreds of demonstrators.
   Two Burmese aircraft took the latest group of students from a
processing center in the northern city of Tak to Burma's capital,
Rangoon. The students were seen off by the Tak governor and Thai Red
Cross officials and welcomed aboard the planes by Burmese military
officers.
   Forty-four more students will return the same way Friday,
officials say. They will be accompanied by Thai and foreign
journalists invited by the Thai military to try to dispel charges
that the students were being forced back to face harsh treatment by
Burmese authorities.
   Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan rejected as ``absolutely
untrue'' charges by Amnesty International, a human rights group,
that Thailand forcibly repatriated 22 students who flew from Tak to
Rangoon on Jan. 6, Thai newspapers reported Thursday.
   Speaking with reporters Wednesday, Chatichai was quoted as saying
he tore up the telexed statement with the charges from the
London-based group as soon as he saw it.
   He suggested Amnesty was interfering in Thailand's affairs, but
he said it and other humanitarian groups were welcome to observe the
repatriations of the students.
   ``We didn't force them back and they all smiled happily when
boarding the planes,'' he said, according to The Nation newspaper.
   ``Thailand is a developing country in Asia, so it is normal that
those European countries like to think that we are still
barbarians,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Thai military officers in charge of the repatriation program also
have strongly denied Amnesty's charges.
   The Amnesty statement, received in Bangkok on Wednesday, said
concern for the students' safety was based on ``increasing
evidence'' that many Burmese arrested for involvement in the
demonstrations have been held without charge or trial. It cited
evidence that some were tortured.
   The group's statement said the 22, of the Shan ethnic minority,
were rounded up by Thai police two weeks ago in Mae Hong Son
province bordering Burma.
   The statement said: ``They are said to have repeatedly expressed
fears for their safety and to have petitioned the Thai authorities
not to be returned to Burma and eventually went on a hunger strike.
They are understood to have been forced to board a plane from Tak
airport on Jan. 6, 1989, by Thai army personnel.
   The group said 14 students detained with them are believed still
held at Tak airport, pending similar repatriation.
   Reporters who accompanied the 22 students on the flight quoted
them as expressing concern for their safety in Burma.
   Thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum, but
Thai army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh visited Burma on Dec. 14
and reached an agreement with Saw Maung to repatriate the students.
Thai officials have said about 7,000 remain at the border.
