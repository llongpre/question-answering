   Government troops have overrun a
stronghold of ethnic minority rebels along the Thai border after 10
days of fighting that killed at least 36 people, a military
spokesman said today.
   The seizure of the town represented another in a string of
victories in recent months that has crippled Burma's ethnic Karen
insurgents.
   Thai authorities, confirming the capture of Three Pagoda Pass,
said 3,000 to 5,000 civilians had fled into Thailand to escape the
fighting.
   The capture came as rebels of the New Mon State Party and the
Karen National Union were preparing to celebrate their national
days. Foreign correspondents in Bangkok, Thailand, had been invited
to the festivities and a news conference at Three Pagoda Pass this
weekend.
   Col. Than Tun, a military spokesman, told reporters that 16
government soldiers were killed and 42 wounded in five major
clashes leading to the capture of the frontier town Thursday. He
said 20 rebel bodies were counted.
   Than Tun said mopping up operations were continuing in the area,
located 170 miles southeast of Rangoon and 175 miles northwest of
Bangkok.
   The Mon and Karen rebels are among several ethnic groups
fighting for greater autonomy from the government dominated by the
Burman majority.
   Col. Lertchai Pinthong of Thailand's border police said fighting
was continuing today at a Mon military camp two miles from Three
Pagoda Pass. He said Thais living in a village opposite the town
had fled their homes and some wounded were being treated at
hospitals inside Thailand.
   The border police also reported escalated fighting at Kaw Moo
Ra, further north along the Thai-Burmese frontier.
   Burmese troops have been trying to seize that Karen base and had
stepped up artillery and mortar barrages in recent days, the police
said.
   Government forces have overrun a string of Karen military bases
along the border, although the Karen National Union's headquarters
at Manerplaw has not been attacked.
   The ramshackle town of Three Pagodas Pass includes a thriving
marketplace, warehouses brimming with smuggled goods and the Mon
headquarters. Some Karen also have been living there.
   The ethnic insurgents have come to rely on smuggling between
Thailand and Burma to fuel their rebellions, while the Burmese
government has stepped up efforts to control the jungle frontier.
   The Mon claim to field more than 3,000 fighters, while the Karen
have a considerably larger force.
   The two have joined 20 other insurgent groups in the Democratic
Alliance of Burma, which has vowed to topple the martial law
government of Gen. Saw Maung.
   Saw Maung and a group of military officers put down a
nationwide, pro-democracy uprising nearly two years ago, killing
hundreds of people. The resistance forces now include students who
fled the interior in wake of the crackdown and sought refuge with
the rebel groups.
