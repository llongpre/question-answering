   Thailand today summoned the Burmese
ambassador and protested a large-scale incursion by Burmese troops,
who crossed the border during an offensive against Karen rebels.
   Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops entered northern
Tak province Saturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai forces
fired artillery at the Burmese soldiers and killed at least six of
them, Thai officials said.
   The Burmese soldiers crossed the border 240 miles north of
Bangkok to attack the Kaw Moo Ra rebel camp along the Moei River.
   The director-general of the Foreign Ministry's political
department, Thep Devakul, lodged the protest with Burmese
Ambassador Nyunt Swe, according to government spokesman Suvit
Yodmanee. Suvit said Thailand demanded compensation for the
incursion, but relations with Rangoon remain ``fairly cordial.''
   ``We consider it serious as far as Burmese troops coming in and
violating the territorial integrity of Thailand, but it was a very
short period and they were actually trying to eliminate the Karen''
rebels, he said.
   In a telephone interview, Nyunt Swe said he told Thep he had no
details from his government about the incident. He said relations
between Bangkok and Rangoon ``are very good.''
   In the past, the Thais have given sanctuary to Karen rebels who
have long been trying to overthrow the Burmese government and who
maintain bases along the Burmese-Thai border. Burma's government
last year killed hundreds of people to crush a popular uprising for
democracy. After some of the student leaders of the uprising joined
the rebels, the government vowed to crush the insurgency.
