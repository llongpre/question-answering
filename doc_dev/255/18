  [Text] The fighting between Burmese Government troops and 
minority rebels which broke out along the Burmese-Thai border 
areas opposite Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai shows no 
sign of cessation. Reinforcements from both sides were sent to 
the battlefields. 
  A report received on 27 May said that the minority rebels 
were well prepared and expected to push the Rangoon troops out 
of the border town of Thachilek soon. The two sides are now 
fighting at 23 different locations in the Shan State. 
Meanwhile, 7,000 rebels are surrounding government strongholds 
at Mong Chot, Mong Pan, and Mong Twan. The government troops in 
the three townships are expected to surrender to the rebels. 
  Two hundred Burmese soldiers were reportedly killed and 
several hundred others wounded during the encounters at Doi Tung 
and Doi Kongmu on the night of 20 May. Rebel casualties were 30 
killed and 65 wounded. The Burmese troops at the three 
locations were assigned to block the road leading to the border 
town of Thachilek. 
  The Border Patrol Police Zone 3 has issued an order 
completely sealing the border with Burma and has pledged to take 
drastic legal action against any persons violating the ban. 
Patrol teams have been sent out to work along the border around 
the clock to cope with any possible territorial infringement. 
  The latest report indicated that Khun Sa's soldiers have 
successfully crossed the Salween River to the western bank 
despite tough resistance from government troops. No reports on 
casualties are available. Three battalions of Khun Sa's Army 
are now surrounding Mong Pyak, Mong Tongi, and Doi Wi, only 30 
kilometers from Tachilek. Khun Sa plans to attack and destroy 
Tachilek before the end of this rainy season. 
  Three hundred and twenty Burmese fled to Thailand from 24 to 
26 May and were later repatriated by Thai authorities. Police 
and military reinforcements were dispatched to guard the border 
in Chiang Rai Province to deter an influx of refugees. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan disclosed that the 
Thai Government has no policy of setting up a new refugee 
holding center. However, refugees from Burma will be allowed to 
stay in the country on a temporary basis.
