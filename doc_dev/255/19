  [Text] Thailand has agreed to arrest Burmese "terrorists" 
travelling on false passports and Burma has agreed to open a 
border checkpoint to take back illegal Burmese immigrants, 
sources said yesterday. 
  The agreement was reached during a meeting of the 
Thai-Burmese Border Committee in Moulmein in Burma. 
  The sources said Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had been told 
of the agreement which would be submitted to the Cabinet for 
acknowledgement on Tuesday. 
  First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo and 
commander of the Burmese Southeastern Regional Army Maj-Gen Ket 
Sein worked out the agreements. 
  Burma said a number of "terrorists" had been using fake 
passports to travel abroad through Bangkok and asked Thailand to 
arrest them. The Burmese did not define the word "terrorists". 
  Thailand said it had a policy not to support Burmese 
terrorists and the Interior and Foreign Ministries would arrest 
them if they passed through Bangkok. Burma gave Thailand a 
report on the false passports and travel documents. Thailand 
told Burma the 300,000 Burmese illegal immigrants causing social 
and economic problems in Thailand must be repatriated. 
  Burma said it would open a checkpoint to take them back if 
it 
could be proven they were Burmese citizens. 
  Representatives of the two countries agreed on developing 
trade and tourism with local border committees of the two 
countries finding ways to achieve this. 
  The Interior Minister, the Customs Department and the Joint 
Operations Center of the Supreme Command had been given 
responsibility for this, the source said. 
  The agreements will be forwarded to the Cabinet on Tuesday 
and another meeting of the Thai-Burmese Border Committee will be 
held in Bangkok at the end of this month, the source said.
