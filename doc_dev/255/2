   Burmese government troops backed by mortars
captured a major rebel camp near the Thai-Burmese frontier, sending
600 civilians of the Karen ethnic group fleeing to Thailand, Thai
officials said today.
   About 900 soldiers of the Burmese army seized the Klerday camp
Wednesday night following a series of attacks on peripheral Karen
outposts, officials said. Klerday is in Burma, opposite the Thai
district of Tha Song Yang in Tak.
   The officials said hundreds of armed Karens fled to areas
southeast of the fallen camp, where the guerrillas hoped to regroup.
   At Klerday, Burmese ground troops fired mortar shells and set
ablaze 80 thatched homes, according to rebels' accounts.
   From the Thai side, smoke was seen for miles some 10 hours after
the incident, a Thai journalist at the border reported.
   Earlier Wednesday, government troops overran two small bases,
forcing a number of the Karen rebels to retreat to Klerday. The
Karen National Union fields 4,000 guerrillas and is regarded as the
strongest of a dozen ethnic rebel organizations fighting the Rangoon
government for greater autonomy.
   A Karen fighter later told The Associated Press that 700
reinforcement units arrived too late at Klerday. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Mong Chi, 40, a Karen civilian who crossed into Thailand, said:
``These attacks by the Burmese troops were the heaviest in years.''
   ``A thousand mortar shells crashed inside and around the camp,
forcing evacuations everywhere,'' he said. ``(There was) no refuge
even in bunkers.''
   Theng Tun, 27, said Burmese troops overran the camp and then
withdrew because they feared retaliation when darkness fell.
   Thai Border Patrol Police who tried to prevent the 600 Karens
from entering Thailand said they saw five Karen teen-agers with M-16
automatic rifles try to cross rapids in the Moei River. All five
were feared drowned, they said.
   Thai authorities are allowing the refugees to remain on the Thai
side of the Moei River, which forms the boundary, but will not let
them move deeper into Thailand. Tak is 230 miles northwest of
Bangkok.
   Recently, the Burmese army has stepped up its attacks on the
Karens, retaking the vital border village of Mae Tha Waw and
disrupting the rebels' main revenue source _ a lucrative smuggling
trade between Burma and Thailand.
