   About 500 Burmese troops clashed with
Thai soldiers on Saturday after crossing the border to attack a
Karen rebel stronghold, a Thai officer said.
   The officer said other Burmese troops perched on two hills in
Burma fired heavy shells on the Kaw Moo Ra stronghold, setting much
of it ablaze in the third straight day of heavy fighting.
   About 1,200 guerrillas were defending the camp against 3,000
soldiers, said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The camp is just across the Moei River separating Burma's Karen
State and the Mae Sot district of Thailand's northern province of
Tak.
   The officer said 400 soldiers crossed into Mae Sot's Ban
Wangkaew village, which has been evacuated due to the fighting, to
set up artillery to shell the camp. Some also seized control of a
road about five miles from Mae Sot, the officer said.
   Thai forces fired heavy rounds into the village, and the Burmese
soldiers later moved to another area inside Thailand, said the
officer.
   He said Thai forces fired artillery rounds to warn another 100
Burmese soldiers who crossed into another area of Mae Sot.
   No soldiers were reported hurt in the clashes, but a 64-year-old
man was wounded by shrapnel from shells that strayed into Mae Sot
from Burma.
   ``They (the Burmese soldiers) are attacking across the river and
fighting us from the Thai side,'' said a Karen official who
demanded anonymity.
   He said the offensive against the rebels was the largest since
1977 and that thousands of Karen civilians had fled to Thailand.
   Thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels, who have
been fighting for four decades for greater autonomy.
   But the trade-oriented Bangkok government has sent senior
officials to Burma to discuss the situation and has repatriated
hundreds of Burmese students who had been fighting alongside the
rebels.
   These actions broke the international isolation of the military
government in Rangoon, which last year killed hundreds of people
while putting down widespread, pro-democracy demonstrations led by
students.
   Government forces began shelling the Kaw Moo Ra stronghold
Thursday, two days after overrunning the major rebel base of
Wangkha, two miles to the south.
   Wangkha was the fifth Karen stronghold along the Thai frontier
to be captured since the government launched an offensive in
October.
   A government spokesman said in Rangoon that at least 43 rebels
and 35 soldiers were killed in the battle for Wangkha.
   With an estimated 4,000 combatants, the Karen National Union is
the largest of 10 ethnic insurgent groups joined in the National
Democratic Front.
   The Karens began their revolt in 1949, the year after Burma
achieved independence from Britain. The rebels said at the time
that the government reneged on its promise of more autonomy for
ethnic minorities.
