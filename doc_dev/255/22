  [Text] Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, deputy chief of staff 
of the Third Army Region, described the situation along the Lao 
and Burmese borders at the Phithak Thai Meeting Hall in Somdet 
Phra Ekathotsarot Camp, Phitsanulok Province at 1000 on 9 March. 
He said the forces of the Kachin minority group have signed a 
cooperation agreement with the Burmese Government. Two hundred 
armed followers of the National United Front under the 
leadership of Sanda and the Communist Party of Burma under its 
leader surrendered to Major Cho Tong, deputy commander of 
Battalion 4789, at its base in Ban Mae Chae, opposite Thailand's 
Tambon Mae La Noi, Mae Hong Son Province in order to negotiate a 
cease-fire. The Burmese soldiers did not confiscate the United 
Front members' weapons. 
  According to Prasit, about 150 members of a Burmese 
engineering battalion have been repairing the road between 
Myawadi and Ban Mae Kasa, opposite Thailand's Phop Phra 
District, Tak Province. They plan to repair the road to reach 
the Phra Chedi Sam Ong [Three Pagodas' Pass] border crossing in 
order to facilitate the conservation of forests in southern 
Burma and the control of minority groups in the area. This 
development could affect Thailand's security, particularly Thai 
villagers near the border. 
  On the Lao border situation, Prasit said the Lao Government 
has stepped up its suppression of antigovernment elements along 
the Thai border. Forces in Ban Yuap -- opposite Thailand's 
Chiang Kham District, Phayao Province -- have been augmented to 
suppress anti- Lao elements under the leadership of Generals 
Vang Pao and Thonglit, who have been active in the Mae Charim 
District and Song Khwae Subdistrict, Nan, and in Chiang Kham 
District, Phayao. It is necessary for the Third Army Region to 
force all anti-Lao elements to cease their activities as the 8 
April opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge approaches. 
  Prasit said Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit are the targets 
of 
the current suppression campaign. This will likely result in 
more Lao people fleeing to Thailand. In that case, Thailand 
will have to force them back.
