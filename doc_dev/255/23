   Burmese government forces overran the
headquarters of an ethnic rebel group over the weekend in battles
on the border that claimed the lives of at least 58 combatants,
Thai and rebel officials said today.
   The officials said the fighting sent thousands of civilians
fleeing into Thailand.
   A bomb blast killed 33 ethnic Karen guerrillas Saturday at their
stronghold of Kaw Moo Ra on Thai territory, a spokesman for the
group said. The spokesman said he believed the blast came from a
booby trap in captured war munitions.
   Thai border police said they found the bodies of 19 Burmese and
six Karen fighters Sunday at the Thai village of Ban Waeng Kaew. It
is directly across opposite Kaw Moo Ra, about 250 miles north of
Bangkok.
   About 200 Burmese troops crossed into Thailand on Friday to
attack the base, one of the last held by the Karen on the frontier.
   Further south on Sunday, about 1,000 Burmese troops overran the
headquarters of the New Mon State Army near the Burmese border
village of Three Pagoda Pass, a Thai official said. They had seized
and burned the town two days earlier.
   Kavee Minwong, district chief of the Thai town of Sangkha just
opposite the battle zone, said Burmese troops began their attack
about midnight Saturday and captured the base early the next day.
   Both sides appeared to have suffered heavy casualties, but
neither was willing to reveal the extent of their losses, he said.
   About 4,000 ethnic Mon civilians fled into Thailand to escape
the fighting and marauding Burmese troops, Kavee said. About 200
Thai civilians were evacuated to safety, he said.
   The official said the Mon refugees would be sent back across the
border once the fighting died down.
   The Karen spokesman said the bomb blast at Kaw Moo Ra occurred
while guerrillas were carrying captured weapons and munitions back
to the camp.
   He said it was one of the worst Karen death tolls in years of
fighting, and he suspected the munitions had been booby-trapped by
the government troops.
   The Karen and the Mon are among the diverse ethnic groups that
have fought for decades against central control by Rangoon.
   Both have relied on controlling smuggling routes between
Thailand and Burma to finance their rebellions.
   However, the military government of Burma launched a sustained
offensive in October 1988 that has badly hurt the Karen.
