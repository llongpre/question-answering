   Karen guerrillas held off a fierce
Burmese assault on a jungle stronghold near the Thai border today,
and 80 Burmese troops were killed in the battle, rebel sources said.
   Heavy fighting was reported after 1,500 Burmese troops met with
stiff resistance as they battled 700 guerrillas in the Pa Loo rebel
camp.
   Shells and mortar rounds rained down on the camp beginning early
today, but the shooting diminished as evening fell.
   Burmese troops also attacked Pa Loo on Sunday. The camp is eight
miles from the Thai border town of Mae Sot.
   Some Karens, who reported the casualties, fled to Thailand to
escape the fighting. There were no reports of rebel casualties or
any independant verification of the number of troops killed.
   Karens are the largest of a dozen ethnic rebel groups that have
fought for greater autonomy from Rangoon for about 40 years.
   That automony was promised to them under Burma's Constitution,
after independence was won from Great Britain in 1948.
   Thai border police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Burmese troops crossed into Thailand this morning and attacked Thai
positions near the village of Mae Kong Khen, just south of Mae Sot.
A Thai soldier was seriously wounded in a firefight. Three Buddhist
monks were also reported hurt as more than 100 Burmese shells landed
inside Thai territory, police said.
   By evening, police said about 50 Burmese troops, who had been
attempting to attack Pa Loo from behind, remained inside Thailand at
Mae Kong Khen, pinned down between Thai and Karen lines and
prevented by both sides from moving.
   The Karen sources, who demanded anonymity, said they were
confident of withstanding the Burmese assault.
   Thai police said 2,000 Karen guerrillas and Burmese civilians
fled into Thialand on Saturday as government troops seized control
of areas near Pa Loo.
   Karen sources said 22 Burmese soldiers and six rebels were killed
in fighting around Pa Loo between June 1 and June 10. Another 31
government troops were wounded, as were 13 Karens, they said.
   Fighting has raged in parts of the Karen state bordering Thailand
since the Burmese army began an intensive campaign to crush the
insurgency in October.
   With larger forces and superior firepower, government forces have
overrun five major Karen camps since December. These setbacks have
severely disrupted the cross-border trade that finances the
insurgency.
   Recent Burmese battle successes have partly been attributed to
the Thai army allowing Burmese troops to enter Thailand and attack
Karen bases from behind, rebels contend. But Thailand last month
protested a large-scale incursion by between 400 and 600 Burmese
troops who burned a village marketplace during an attack on the
Karen camp at Kaw Moo Ra on May 20.
   Burma expressed regret over the incident but asked Thailand not
to permit insurgents to take refugee on the Thai side of the border.
   Thailand has strengthened trade links with Burma since the
military took power in Rangoon in September and is anxious to ensure
the smooth flow of official trade across the frontier.
