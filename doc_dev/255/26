   Companions said Soe Win, a villager
kidnapped by Burmese troops, collapsed on a forced border trek, his
strength sapped by lung disease and the huge load of rice and
mortar shells on his back.
   Because he was no longer useful as a porter, they said, a
soldier of the 66th Infantry Division smashed Soe Win's head
against a rock half a dozen times and kicked his lifeless body down
the mountainside. Two other porters said they witnessed the death
and were able to escape.
   Many stories like theirs are heard along the frontier between
Thailand and Burma. A decades-old war between Burma's repressive
government and ethnic minorities seeking autonomy has turned the
frontier into region of brutality, deceit and despoiled
environment. And a growing tide of refugees is beginning to alarm
foreign aid agencies.
   The war initially attracted little attention because it was
remote and Burma kept foreigners out of the area, but the scale and
violence have grown dramatically in recent years.
   After brutally crushing a pro-democracy uprising in September
1988, the military rulers in Rangoon turned their attention to the
Thai border.
   Burma was bankrupt, but ethnic rebels were making millions of
dollars smuggling consumer goods, jade, antiques, timber and
sometimes narcotics across a porous frontier 1,350 miles long.
   Most of the world has shunned the Rangoon generals, who found
allies in powerful Thai military and business circles.
   Deals were made. The Thais got access to one of the world's last
great teak forests in exchange for hard currency, part of which
financed an army campaign to clear the border so the deals could be
carried out.
   Conservation groups and the U.S. Congress have criticized the
destruction of the forest.
   ``The scale of the logging is mind-boggling,'' a Western
official said on condition of anonymity. ``The Thais are hacking it
out as fast as they can. They know the honeymoon won't last
forever.''
   By most accounts, the Burmese army's border campaign has been
ruthless.
   Refugees, aid workers, escaped porters and guerrillas along the
frontier and in rebel-controlled areas of Burma told of villages
razed and rice stocks burned.
   They spoke of civilians tortured and shot, including children;
of whole village populations taken from their homes and herded into
areas controlled by the military.
   Two groups of porters, totaling 50 men and boys ranging in age
from a 57-year-old farmer to a 14-year-old cowherd, described
grueling marches, starvation diets and walking ahead of the
soldiers as human mine detectors.
   Others were shot down while trying to escape, they said. Several
of the survivors, who included ethnic minorities and majority
Burmese, had scars they said resulted from beatings.
   Wallace Yay, coordinator of aid to refugees from the Karen
minority in Thailand, said: ``The Burmese military has shown a
willingness to shoot down its own, but in minority areas it just
lets loose.''
   ``I don't think genocide is too strong a term to describe what
the Burmese military is doing,'' said Court Robinson of the U.S.
Committee for Refugees, a private group. ``It is clear they are
trying to eliminate the ethnics as a political and cultural
entity.''
   Burma has denied such allegations, including those Amnesty
International made in two detailed reports issued in 1988.
   Amnesty International, a human rights group based in London,
cited ``a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights''
against the Karen, Kachin, Mon, Karenni and Shan minorities.
   It and other organizations also have noted the use of terrorist
tactics by guerrilla groups, but no evidence has emerged that the
scale or intensity of such acts approaches that of the army.
   The border campaign has spurred flight into Thailand, increasing
the number of refugees in the frontier area to at least 40,000.
Most are from ethnic minorities, but they also include Burmese
students and other dissidents, several thousand of whom joined the
rebels during the 1988 repression.
   Robinson and other aid officials believe tens of thousands more
may flee.
   Refugees say word that the Burmese are coming is enough to send
everyone in a village fleeing to the jungle.
   Thailand's government does not grant refugee status to people
who have fled Burma. Little aid has been forthcoming from foreign
agencies, in contrast to the enormous international effort made for
those from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos who have sought refuge in
Thailand.
   Over the years, the so-called ``forgotten refugees'' have
received modest help from the private French agency Doctors Without
Borders and a consortium of more than a dozen Christian groups.
   Now, the needs are greater.
   ``We cannot live on rice, salt and fish paste for long,'' said
Mya Thein, leader of 4,000 Karen civilians who crossed the border
early in February. He said some of the children had cholera.
   About 150 Burmese students and other dissidents live in a
section of what is called Mawke Camp. They ask why the world pays
so much attention to those who fled military repression in China
and so little to them, in their crude huts and malarial jungle.
   ``I think we will be here a long time,'' said Mya Thein, a high
school principal who lost his left leg to a Burmese mortar in 1987.
``In the past, the Burmese would take an area, hold it for a while
and then retreat when the rains came. Now I think they will stay
because of the logs.''
   Rebel officers claim Burmese troops have been allowed to use
Thai territory to surround Karen positions and have been taken
inside the teak forest in trucks owned by Thai logging companies.
   Burmese students say Thailand's actions will not be forgotten if
democracy comes to their country.
