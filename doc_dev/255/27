  [Text] The Burmese Government handed over 31 Thai citizens 
who had been imprisoned in Burma to Thai representatives in 
Kawthaung at 0900 today. Among the Thai representatives who 
received the Thai citizens were the 1st Army Region deputy 
commander; a representative of the 4th Army Region commander; 
the Ranong governor; representatives of the Fisheries 
Department; the chief of the Office for Protection of the 
Interests of Thai Citizens Abroad under the office of the 
Foreign Ministry permanent secretary; and officials from other 
relevant government agencies. 
  The release of the 31 Thai citizens was the result of the 
talks Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri held with Senior General 
Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, during his April visit to Burma. He asked the Burmese 
side to reduce the sentences or grant pardons to Thai citizens 
imprisoned in Burma. On 27 April, at the closing ceremony of 
the Ninth Thai-Burmese Joint Border Commission meeting, the 
chief of the Burmese delegation announced that Burma had decided 
to release 31 Thai citizens held in Burma after taking into 
account the good relations between Thailand and Burma and the 
success of the meeting.
