   Burmese guerrillas killed at least 40
government troops while defending a rebel camp along the Thai
border, rebel sources said today.
   The Karen rebel sources and students fighting alongside them
said at least 45 other soldiers were wounded in Wednesday's
fighting at Wan Kha. Two guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded,
they claimed.
   Wan Kha is in Burma across the border from the northern Thai
province of Tak.
   The Karens are among a dozen ethnic-based rebel groups fighting
for more autonomy from Burma's government. The government has
intensified its offensive in recent months and seized several major
Karen bases along the Thai border.
   Thai border police today also reported fighting at Yahjaw and
Chikaya in Burma's Mae Ramat district, near the border.
   The police said about 750 Karens have fled the fighting into the
Mae Ramat district of Tak province.
   On Tuesday, police said, Burmese troops crossed into Thailand
and looted shops of rice, cooking oil and clothes.
   In a statement dated May 9 and received in Bangkok today, Sen.
Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, condemned the Burmese
government and called for international mediation to end the
fighting.
   ``We have been heartened by the news that the Cambodian civil
war might soon be resolved, but not 300 miles from the battlefields
of Cambodia an equally bloody civil war is being fought in tragic
obscurity,'' the statement said.
   ``In Burma, a brutal military government which has been
condemned by the international community is escalating its war with
the armed Burmese opposition,'' it said.
   ``The war needs mediation. The opposition desires it. Someone,
the United States, the United Nations, or ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) should be able to provide it,'' the
statement said.
   Moynihan accused the Burmese army of attacking rebel positions
where thousands of students fled after last year's military coup.
   Students were at the forefront of last year's nationwide
campaign for democracy. The army crushed the campaign after the
Sept. 18 coup.
