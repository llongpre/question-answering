<HEAD>Thailand Threatens U.N. Officials Who Aid Burma Students</HEAD>

   The government has said it will expel
U.N. or other refugee officials who provide aid to Burmese
dissidents living in Thailand, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Chamnarn Potjana, deputy permanent secretary of the Interior
Ministry, on Friday warned international organizations to stop
helping Burmese students, according to the Nation newspaper.
   If they do not, Chamnarn was quoted as saying, ``no matter
whether they are officials of the UNHCR (U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees) or other United Nations agencies, we will ask the Foreign
Ministry to expel them from the country as persona non grata.''
   Thailand has close ties to the military government that took
power in Burma in 1988, crushing a student-led pro-democracy
movement. Thousands fled and many joined rebel groups based along
Burma's border with Thailand and India.
   The government began reconsidering the status of Burmese
dissidents after two Burmese students hijacked a Thai airliner
flying to their homeland on Nov. 10. Two other Burmese students
hijacked an jetliner to Thailand a year ago.
   Thaung Htun, a spokesman for the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front, said the Thai government ``should consider the problem of
Burmese students from a humanitarian point of view. Any person who
fled should have the rights of a refugee.''
   Chamnarn spoke after a Cabinet committee meeting to discuss what
measures to take regarding the students. He said the committee had
recommended establishing a holding camp for Burmese dissidents on
the Thai-Burma border.
   The Nation quoted Chamnarn as saying the High Commissioner
should use the $120,000 monthly allowance allocated to Burmese
students to establish the camp.
   The private U.S. Committee for Refugees estimates 2,000 Burmese
students live in Bangkok. Another 2,700 are on the Thai-Burma
border, according to the All Burma Students' Democratic Front, the
main group of exiled students.
   Thailand considers the students illegal immigrants subject to
detention, fines and deportation. The students depend on aid from
private relief groups and grants from the U.N. High Commissioner
that range from $40 to $120 a month.
   According to the U.S. Committee for Refugees, since 1988
Thailand has repatriated more than 5,200 Burmese, many of them
students. Amnesty International has cited reports that Burmese
authorities have brutally interrogated and tortured some students
repatriated from Thailand.
   The Bangkok Post quoted Chamnarn as saying that in addition to
the hijacking, Burmese students were believed responsible for a
small bomb attack recently on the Burmese Embassy compound in
Bangkok. He said Thailand would deport those who violated its
immigration law and penal code.
