   Amnesty International charged that
Burmese military authorities arrested at least three Burmese
students shortly after Thailand forced them to return home.
   A 21-year-old student taken into military custody in a separate
case died two days after his release, apparently from harsh
treatment in detention, the London-based human rights organization
said.
   The statement, dated Thursday, was received by telex in Bangkok
today, a day after another Amnesty statement accused Thai military
authorities of forcibly repatriating 22 students who fled Burma
after a bloody military coup in September. Thai officials said they
returned voluntarily.
   In Tokyo, Japan today announced it would suspend a $7.4 million
grant to Burma because it is under military rule. Japan's Foreign
Ministry said it has not recognized Gen. Saw Maung, who seized power
after a bloody September coup, as Burma's legitimate leader.
   The latest Amnesty International statement said that according to
the Burmese state radio, two students repatriated Saturday, Sao Myo
Win Tun and Kyi Moe, were arrested shortly after their return and
taken into military custody for questioning.
   Amnesty previously said the two students had taken leading roles
in the August and September demonstrations for democracy in Shan
state.
   The statement said other reports indicated authorities arrested a
third student Saturday, Tu Ain Tin, who had become popular among
demonstrators for performing pro-democracy songs.
   The statement said Amnesty also was concerned that another
pro-democracy demonstrator, Zaw Win Tin of the Burmese capital of
Rangoon, reportedly died Dec. 30, ``less than 48 hours after he was
released from military custody.''
   ``He had been arrested several weeks earlier and had apparently
been held incommunicado without charge or trial since then,''
Amnesty said. ``He is said to have died from the effect of the
severe ill treatment he sustained while in prison.''
   Amnesty has reported many Burmese arrested for involvement in the
pro-democracy campaign have been held without charge or trial and
that some have been tortured or otherwise harshly treated.
   Students led last year's nationwide demonstrations for democracy
in Burma until Saw Maung took power Sept. 18. His troops cleared the
streets by killing hundreds of unarmed demonstrators.
   Thousands of students fled to Thai border areas controlled by
anti-government guerrillas, seeking refuge and in some cases,
military training. Thai officials have said about 7,000 remain at
the border.
   Thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum but then
army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh broke an international
campaign to isolate Burma's government and reached an agreement with
Saw Maung to send the students home.
   Saw Maung's government promised no action against the students
and denied accusations of arrests and harsh treatment.
   Under the program, the students are brought to Tak in northern
Thailand and then flown to Rangoon aboard Burmese military aircraft.
   Seventy-six students returned Thursday, bringing to 260 the
number who have returned under the program, Thai officials said.
