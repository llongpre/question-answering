<HEAD>Human Rights Group Urges Halt to Forced Return of Refugees</HEAD>

   The forced return of Burmese refugees
to their homeland was condemned Wednesday by a human rights group
urging a halt to the deportations.
   The U.S.-based Asia Watch organization requested President Bush
to demand an end to Thailand's repatriation policy. The group
claims some Burmese returnees are unwillingly pressed into military
service and could be used as ``human mine sweepers.''
   Thailand's prime minister, Chatichai Choonhavan, is scheduled to
meet with Bush on Thursday in Washington.
   Thai police and troops last week forced about 1,000 Burmese
civilians living in northwestern Thailand to cross the Moei River
back into Burma.
   Thai officials have said there is no danger for most refugees to
return to Burma since democratic reforms were endorsed in the
nation's first free elections in 30 years. But there are still
doubts whether the military will abide by the May 27 election
results.
   ``The Thai government appears to be cynically exploiting the
results of Burma's elections in order to rid itself of a swelling
population of refugees who have fled Burma in fear of their
lives,'' said the statement, seen Wednesday in Bangkok.
   Several minority groups in the rugged northern frontier area
have been fighting the central Rangoon government for autonomy for
the past three decades.
   The Asia Watch statement said there was ``no evidence that army
soldiers have halted their systematic violations of human rights.''
The group cited reports that Thai police had burned the homes and
belongings of those deported.
   By late Friday, Burmese authorities had received 766 people
repatriated from Thailand, said government spokesman Kyaw Sann.
   He said there were 27 camps along the border to receive the
returnees, and those resettled would be given plots of land.
   But the Asia Watch statement said the returnees had been
``imprisoned in monasteries and temple compounds,'' and only those
with identity cards and able to pay $150 were freed.
   Others were forced into military service, acting as porters or
leading patrols through mine-filled areas, the group charges.
   ``Civilian porters compelled to serve as human mine sweepers for
the army have offered numerous testimonies concerning the reckless
disregard for human life routinely exhibited by the Burmese army,''
it added.
   Several human right organizations have accused the Burmese army
of murdering and abusing those it has pressed into its service.
