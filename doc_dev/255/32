  [Text] The Karen are Thailand's ecological conscience. 
  And if Thailand's ambitious plans to build dams on border 
rivers are seen through, the Karen could soon weigh heavily on 
Thailand's humanitarian conscience. 
  Living among the river valleys on the border between 
Thailand 
and Burma, they -- like the Penans in Malaysia -- depend on 
having a healthy forest to maintain their way of life. They 
have suffered heavily from the intensive logging carried out by 
Thai firms in Burmese forests. 
  Unlike the Penan, of course, the Karen having been fighting 
a 
war of self-determination against Burma's military regime for 
the last 40 years. This has placed them in a vulnerable 
position vis-a-vis Thailand, a fact which the government has 
exploited to demand timber concessions. 
  In need of arms and Thailand's favour, the Karen have been 
forced to accept the logging. But now Thailand wants to 
construct dams on their territory. 
  Out of its entire winding course from the Tibetan Plateau 
down to the Gulf of Martaban, the Salween River only touches the 
Thai border for roughly 100 kilometres. Less than six percent 
of the river's catchment area lies within Thailand. Yet the 
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) is planning 
to build two major dams on this major river. 
  The biggest, the Upper Salween Dam, will be located 76 kms 
upstream from the confluence of the Moei and Salween Rivers. 
The 166-metre high dam would probably flood more than 1,000 
square kms of land, almost entirely in Karenni and Shan States 
in Burma. 
  But the electricity and the water would go to Thailand. 
  The dam would have an installed electricity generating 
capacity of 4,540 megawatts, nearly five times more than 
Thailand's largest dam making it possibly the biggest dam in 
Southeast Asia (Malaysia is planning a 16,000-MW dam in Sarawak 
State). 
  Thailand and Burma are planning seven other joint dam 
projects, including the Lower Salween Dam, three on the Moei 
River which divides Thailand from Burma further south, and one 
dam apiece on the Mae Sai, Mae Nam Kok and Klong Kra Buri. 
Plans have been drawn up to pump water from the proposed Moei 
and Salween reservoirs over the mountains and into the severely 
depleted Phumiphon Reservoir. 
  Feasibility studies for seven of these projects have already 
been carried out at the request of the Thai and Burmese 
governments by the secretive, Japan-based Electric Power 
Development Corp, a ``special corporation'' largely funded by 
the Japanese government and closely connected to Japan's 
overseas development aid institutions. 
  The Upper and Lower Salween Dams are expected to cost around 
Bt100 million. With the World Bank turning away from other 
large-scale hydro projects such as the Narmada in India, it's 
not at all clear where the money will come from. 
  More to the point, it's not at all clear where the Karen 
living along the Salween and Moei River valleys are going to go. 
The dams will destroy not only their homes but their way of 
life, turning them into refugees. 
  The Karen will be forced into making a terrible choice, 
between living in Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration 
Council] concentration camps or Thai refugee camps. Under 
outside pressure, the Thai government has quietly tolerated the 
presence of Karen refugees, but always with reluctance and 
irritation. 
  If a military force were to move in and kick the Karen off 
their land at gunpoint, it would be condemned as naked 
aggression. So why should flooding them off their land be 
judged any differently? Thailand seems to be embarking on dam 
warfare, a serious matter since the people to be displaced are 
well-armed. 
  The Karen are also well aware that electricity for Thailand 
means power for Slorc, the military junta now ruling Burma. 
``Thailand will get the energy, Slorc will get the money, and 
we will be left to deal with the impacts of the dam,'' one Karen 
leader has noted. 
  Nor is the international community likely to accept this 
matter lying down. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
has recently recommended by unanimous vote that the Clinton 
administration take a much closer look at the human rights 
situation in Burma. According to the London-based human rights 
organization Amnesty International, a climate fear is still 
prevalent in the country, despite cosmetic changes by the ruling 
military junta. 
  While damming the border rivers may at first glance seem to 
be an easy way to generate cheap electricity and -- by filling 
up the Phumiphon Reservoir -- to show that dams can work as a 
replacement for watershed forests, the hidden costs of these 
schemes are overwhelmingly large. 
  Dams have long been decried as a crime against nature. These 
projects on the border rivers, however, are also a crime against 
the Karen. And since they are to be imposed on a minority 
people for the benefit of a foreign power, they are nothing less 
than a crime against humanity.
