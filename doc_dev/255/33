   Thailand and Burma on Friday denied
allegations by Amnesty International that Burmese students have been
forcibly repatriated from Thailand and arrested upon their arrival
in Burma.
   ``I believe the government has more information than a body which
is 1,000 miles away,'' Ohn Gyaw, head of the Burmese Foreign
Ministry's Political Department, said in response to the charges by
the London-based group.
   Ohn Gyaw spoke with reporters invited by the Thai military to
accompany 32 students on a flight Friday from Thailand. Under an
agreement reached in December by the Thai army chief and Burma's
leader, Gen. Saw Maung, 292 Burmese students have been repatriated.
   The Amnesty International statement said 22 students who returned
Jan. 7 were forced to after being rounded up by Thai police.
   It said Thai army personnel forced them onto the plane even
though the students expressed fears for their safety, petitioned to
be allowed to stay in Thailand, and went on a hunger strike.
   According to Burmese state radio, two of the students _ Sao Myo
Win Tun and Kyi Moe _ were taken into military custody for
questioning and reports indicated a third, Tu Ain Tin, also was
arrested, Amnesty International said.
   The group said the three were active in pro-democracy
demonstrations in August and September.
   ``As far as we know, Kyi Moe is at home right now,'' Ohn Gyaw
said, adding that Sao Myo Win Tun and others also were ``peacefully
at home.''
   Amnesty International said it also had reports that another
student, Zaw Win Tin, died Dec. 30, after being held in military
custody in Burma.
   ``He had been arrested several weeks earlier and had apparently
been held incommunicado without charge or trial since then,''
Amnesty International said. ``He is said to have died from the
effect of the severe ill treatment he sustained while in prison.''
   Students had led a nationwide pro-democracy campaign until Saw
Maung seized power Sept. 18. Thousands of students fled to Thai
border areas controlled by anti-government guerrillas, seeking
refuge and military training.
   Thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum. That
changed after the Thai army chief, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh,
visited Burma on Dec. 14 and reached the repatriation agreement.
   At the news conference in Rangoon were students who said they had
made several trips to the border to try to persuade fellow students
to return. The students said they had returned to Burma because they
felt ``used'' by the insurgents.
   Before Friday's flight left Tak in Thailand, Col. Chalermsak
Sirisukha said: ``We have always persuaded the students and others
to go home and have repeatedly insisted that anyone who is not yet
ready to go back can stay here. There is no element of coercion.''
   As the students marched to the plane, a Thai official shouted:
``Anyone who has any reservations about going back, please return
now to your tent!'' No one did.
   ``I believe it's safe now to go back,'' said Ne Lin U, 19.
``Thailand has provided us help and now I can return.''
   Kyaw Kyaw Aung, 33, said: ``The camp administrators did not force
us back. If I stay on, I cannot move freely and conduct
pro-democracy movements.''
   Another 29 students are to fly back on Saturday.
   ``If I could stay, I would stay,'' said one, Aung Soe Moe.
