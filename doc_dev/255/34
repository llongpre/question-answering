  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Surin Phitsuwan held a 
briefing on 16 February to describe his meeting with U.S. 
Representative William Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, 
who called on him at the Foreign Ministry. The latter detailed 
his 14-15 February visit to Burma, authorized by the Burmese 
Government, to meet with Burmese leader General Khin Nyunt and 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. 
  Minister Surin said the new development reflects U.S. 
interest in Burma and the importance it attaches to diplomatic 
contacts with Burma. It also reflects the same concern that 
ASEAN feels for Burma. The deputy foreign minister said 
Representative William Richardson expressed his satisfaction 
that there is greater access to the Burmese leader and to Aung 
San Suu Kyi as a result of the constructive engagement policy. 
  Mr. William Richardson also wants Thailand to help promote 
unity in Burma in the areas of politics, narcotics, and human 
rights, and stressed Thailand's role with regards to the Burmese 
refugees at the common border with Burma. He said that 
Thailand, as Burma's neighbor, is in a good position to help 
Burma solve these problems. The deputy foreign minister said 
Thailand would do as much as it could to help Burma and provide 
the facilities that it needs.
