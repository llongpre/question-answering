  [Text] The police arrested of the 17 anti-Burmese 
Government elements of the Mon ethinic group on charge of 
illegal entry into the country early in the morning of 25 
February. One of those arrested was identified as Chaiyot 
Pinsukan, alias "Nai Phayap," a former Kuomintang military 
officer who is regarded as a key man in the Mon leadership. He 
was charged with sheltering illegal immigrants. The arrest, 
which took place only one day before the celebration of the Mon 
ethnic group's national day scheduled at a stronghold at Hub 
Phak border pass in Marid township near the Thai- Burmese 
border, served as a warning for the Burmese minority groups that 
are now engaging in the rebellion against the Burmese Government. 
  A source close to Chaiyot told PHUCHATKAN that the arrest 
was 
definitely politically motivated because Chaiyot and other Mon 
leaders were known to have been active in opposing the 
cease-fire talks between the New Mon State Party and Burmese 
regime. They believe that the cease fire agreement will bring 
an end to their struggle for national liberation. 
  On 24 February, the Mon arrestees lodged a letter with the 
United Nations Office in Bangkok to demand the separation of 
their area from Burma and complain about Mons being deprived of 
their human rights by the Burmese Government and the eviction of 
the Mon refugees in Kanchanaburi Province. 
  The source disclosed that the arrest took place at about 
0600 
on 25 February when immigrantion police and officers from the 
Police Special Branch raided a house on Soi Ramkhamhaeng in 
Bangkapi District of Bangkok. Chaiyot reportedly used the house 
as his office and a shelter for the Mon during their stay in 
Thailand. 
  However, some of the Mon were later released because they 
could produce official permits allowing them to travel outside 
the restricted areas. 
  Meanwhile, Chaiyot is still being detained at the 
Immigration 
Police Command Headquarters. His Taiwanese wife is seeking 
legal help to bail him out. Earlier, Special Police Branch was 
keeping a close surveillance on Chaiyot's movements because the 
Thai Government feared that the activities of the Mon rebels on 
Thai soil might damage relations between Thailand and Burma and 
create obstacles to the ongoing cease-fire talks between the 
Burmese Government and minority groups. 
  During an interview granted to PHUCHATKAN prior to his 
arrest, Chaiyot claimed that he had 5,000 Mon soldiers under his 
control to fight the Rangoon regime. He stressed that he would 
continue to lead the struggle against the Burmese Government 
even if the New Mon Party signed a cease-fire agreement with the 
Burmese authority, saying that he was not afraid of being 
arrested. He said: "You only die once. They can do anything 
with me." 
  However, Nai Aung Tin, secretary general of the executive 
committee of the New Mon State Party, told PHUCHATKAN in an 
interview during the celebration of the Mon national day in 
Marid that Chaiyot does not play any role in the party. He is 
an outsider who used to support the party. 
  It was reported that the Burmese Government and four ethnic 
groups, namely Kachin, Red Wa, Kokang, and Palaung have now 
agreed to a cease-fire. The Karen, Karenni, and Mon are the 
only three groups that are still at odds with Rangoon. The 
Karen once requested Thailand to host peace talks, but the Thai 
Government rejected their request.
