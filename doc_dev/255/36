   Rebels attacked a Burmese town early
today and killed at least seven people, according to reports from
the Burmese government and from people who said they fled the
ambush.
   Karen rebels fired rocket-propelled grenades into houses in the
town of Myawaddy and shot at those who tried to escape their
burning homes, said refugees who crossed the border into Thailand.
   More than 180 houses and government buildings and 30 trucks were
set ablaze during the 2 a.m. attack, and at least 16 people
wounded, the refugees said.
   In Burma's capital, Rangoon, government spokesman Kyaw Sann told
a news conference the town was attacked by 150 rebels. He said two
policemen and five civilians were killed and nine others, including
four soldiers, were injured.
   The refugees said 12 people died and that all were Burmese
except for one Thai who was visiting the town, just across the Moei
River border.
   Thai officials said 14 Burmese were sent to the Mae Sot
hospital, eight in serious condition. Two Thais also were injured.
   The Karens withdrew from Myawaddy after 3 a.m. but continued
firing to prevent residents from putting out the fires, the
refugees said.
   They said guerrillas came from two nearby Karen camps and
attacked while most of the Burmese government soldiers normally
occupying the town were away.
   The Karens have been sporadically attacking Myawaddy, 165 miles
east of Rangoon, since February. Thai officials say the attacks are
retaliation for government assaults on Karen bases.
   Government forces have captured two major Karen strongholds
along the Thai border _ Maela and Maw Poh Kay _ in the past month.
   Guerrillas of the Karen ethnic minority have been fighting the
government since Burma achieved independence from Britain in 1948.
