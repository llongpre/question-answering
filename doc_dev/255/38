<HEAD>Thailand Complains Burmese Troops Enter Thailand Pursuing Rebels</HEAD>

   Thailand complained to Burma on Monday
about a large-scale incursion of Burmese troops who were attacking
Karen rebels, the government spokesman said.
   Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops trying to attack
the rebels from the rear intruded into northern Tak province
Saturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai border police found
the bodies of six Burmese soldiers after pushing the intruders back
with artillery fire, officials said Monday.
   Government spokesman Suvit Yodmanee said Director General Thep
Devakul of the Foreign Ministry's political department summoned
Burmese Ambassador Nyunt Swe and lodged a protest.
   He said Thailand demanded compensation.
   ``So long as they stay inside their borders we consider that a
Burmese affair. Once they come into Thailand, it is our policy to
drive anybody back, Karens or Burmese,'' Suvit said.
   The military government in Rangoon last year killed hundreds of
Burmese in crushing a popular uprising for democracy and vowed to
destroy the Karens, an ethnic rebel group that has fought for 40
years for greater autonomy.
   Thailand said Burmese soldiers over the weekend intruded into
Ban Wangkaew village of Mae Sot district, about 235 miles north of
Bangkok, and attacked the rebel camp of Kaw Moo Ra, which is
separated from Thailand by the Moei River.
   Thai officers said the soldiers were driven back before dawn
Sunday. They said six bodies were found.
   Karen sources claimed 60 to 65 Burmese soldiers were killed in
fighting Saturday and many wounded. Five rebels were killed and 11
wounded, they claimed. One Burmese student fighting alongside the
rebels was killed and another wounded, they said.
   Government forces began their attack on Ko Moo Ra on Thursday,
after overrunning the major rebel stronghold of Wangkha two days
earlier.
   Rebel officials say the loss of five key border crossings since
the Burmese intensified their offensive last October has severely
disrupted the black market trade that has sustained their
insurgency.
