   Hundreds of Burmese troops backed by
mortar and artillery fire today attacked Karen guerrilla positions
near the Thai border, Karen rebel sources said.
   Thai border patrol police said more than 50 mortar and artillery
shells fell into Thailand, and Burmese machine-gun fire hit three
houses and a Buddhist temple in the border village of Mae Kone Kane.
   Thai police returned the fire, the border patrol said.
   Fierce fighting began before dawn as at least 800 government
troops attacked the Karen base of Pa Loo, about eight miles south of
the Thai border town of Mae Sot, said the guerrilla sources on
condition of anonymity.
   Burmese troops pounded Pa Loo and the nearby camp at Kaw Moo Ra
with hundreds of mortar and artillery rounds, they said. Both camps
are separated from Thailand by the Moei River.
   No casualties were immediately reported.
   With about 8,000 armed fighters, the Karens are the largest of a
dozen ethnic groups that have fought for more than four decades for
greater autonomy from Rangoon.
   Since December, government forces have seized five key guerrilla
bases.
   The guerrillas claim they have killed up to 2,000 Burmese and
wounded another 4,000 in the government offensive.
   Thai military sources said that up to June 15, about 185 Burmese
troops were killed and at least 470 wounded in attacks on Pa Loo and
Kaw Moo Ra that began in May. Karen casualties have been light, they
said, with only six rebels reported dead and another 17 wounded.
   In an interview on Sunday at the Karen headquarters of Manerplaw,
rebel commmander Bo Mya said that his fighters would revert to
broader guerrilla actions against targets inside Burma following the
loss of key border positions.
   He dismissed suggestions that the rebels were near defeat, but
other Karen officials based along the Thai border said the
insurgency was at its lowest point ever.
   Bo Mya blamed recent Burmese successes on the economic boost
Rangoon received from its trade ties with Thailand. The Karens also
charged that government forces have been permitted to enter Thailand
to attack their positions from the rear.
