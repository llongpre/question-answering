<HEAD>Thailand to Open Repatriation Camp for Burmese Students</HEAD>

   Thailand has announced it will open a
transition camp for Burmese students who had fled the military
crackdown in their country and now want to return home.
   The agreement to open the camp was reached in talks last week
between the Burmese leader, Gen. Saw Maung, and Gen. Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, the Thai army chief who was the first foreign
dignitary to visit Burma since the Sept. 18 coup.
   Chavalit, speaking on army-run Channel 5 television, said the
camp would be opened Wednesday at the airport in the city of Tak,
about 50 miles from the Burmese border. Burma said last month it
would send aircraft to transport the students who want to go home.
   ``The Thai government is worried about hardships on these
students and has been assured by the Burmese government of their
safety when they return,'' he said.
   He said the students will receive medical examinations while they
wait for repatriation at the camp administered by the Thai army and
the Thai and Burmese Red Cross.
   Students had been at the forefront of this year's pro-democracy
demonstrations in Burma, ruled by military autocracies for the past
quarter century. Thousands of the protesters fled the cities after a
bloody crackdown by the government.
   Thai officials said more than 7,000 Burmese students joined
anti-government guerrilla groups based along the Thai border. The
rebels have been waging a four-decade war for greater autonomy.
   Chavalit said about 300 of the students had made their way from
the border to Bangkok.
   On Tuesday, 30 Burmese students met with Chavalit in Bangkok and
asked his help in arranging a meeting between them and Saw Maung to
discuss his request that they return.
   Chavalit's visit to Burma on Wednesday marked a break in the
informal international agreement to refrain from any moves that
might imply recognition of the Saw Maung government.
   Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Prapas Limpabandhu, told
reporters today that he will visit Burma ``to tell them we want to
see Burma develop democracy.''
   No date has been set.
   Asked if his visit meant Thai recognition of the Burmese
government, Prapas said the Thai Embassy remains open, and that
means recognition.
