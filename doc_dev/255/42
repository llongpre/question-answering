   Mortar shells from fighting between Burmese
troops and rebel forces destroyed 55 houses and wounded two people
at a village just inside the Thai border, a senior police officer
said today.
   Col. Amphol Ngamchit, police chief of Tak Province, said a woman
and a young girl were wounded in Mae Salit village, which straddles
the Burma-Thailand frontier. Damage was estimated at $500,000.
   The fighting Friday was part of an intensified campaign by the
Burmese military against the Karen National Union, the strongest of
a dozen ethnic minority organizations seeking greater autonomy. The
Karen groups fields about 4,000 guerrillas and operates primarily
along the rugged Thai border.
   Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt told journalists in Rangoon, the Burmese
capital, that Burmese forces captured the Karen stronghold of Kler
Day a week ago and last Thursday seized Maetri, another Karen
settlement.
   Thai officials said hundreds of armed Karens fled to areas
southeast of Kler Day where the guerrillas hoped to regroup.
   Late last year, the Burmese army retook the vital border village
of Mae Tha Waw, disrupting the rebels' main source of revenue _ a
lucrative smuggling trade between Burma and Thailand.
