   A Burmese student group Sunday said the
demands of two Burmese hijackers that democracy be returned to
their homeland were ``identical to those of the people of Burma.''
   ``We regard this (hijacking) as a reaction to the current
situation in Burma where freedom of speech is totally impossible,''
said a press release from the All Burma Students Democratic Front.
   On Saturday, Thailand said it would not repatriate the students,
who hijacked a Burmese domestic flight with 83 others aboard then
threatened to blow up the plane if their demands for reform were
not met.
   The Front is the major representative of students who fled
central Burma to fight for democracy from camps along the country's
borders after the military brutally crushed a student-led uprising
there last year.
   It claims that nearly 5,000 students and other dissidents are
living in 24 frontier camps under the protection of various ethnic
minority groups also battling the military-led government.
   ``Their demands are identical to those of the people of Burma,
and these are the demands we have been relaying the world with our
tears and blood since the brutal military takeover in Burma,'' said
the release, seen in Bangkok.
   An official media report from Burma Sunday said the hijacking
was settled successfully because of good relations between Thailand
and Burma.
   A Radio Rangoon broadcast gave details of the hijacking Friday
by the students, who diverted a Fokker 28 domestic airliner to
Thailand and held 83 people hostage for about 10 hours before
surrendering to Thai officials.
   The students are being held in military custody, but Thai
officials have said they would not be repatriated.
   ``We will not hurt them. They will not be sent back to Burma,''
Deputy Prime Minister Tienchai Sirisunpan said in a news
conference. ``The Burmese government also does not want them back.
So far they have not asked for asylum in any country.''
   Although Thailand has friendly relations with Burma, it does not
have an extradition treaty with the military government in Rangoon.
   ``As I understand it, they want to let the world know what has
happened in Burma, especially the life without freedom of Burmese
citizens,'' Tienchai said.
   The hijackers demands included the release of political
prisoners, lifting of martial law, freedom of the press and the
formation of an interim government with persons nominated by the
United Nations, the radio broadcast said.
   The hijackers also wanted the release of opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi, the ``governing of the people leniently'' and
``ordering soldiers back to the barracks.''
   A military junta seized power in Burma in September 1988
following a nationwide uprising to demand an end to a quarter
century of authoritarian rule.
   The military has promised general elections next year, but in
July placed under house arrest its leading opponent, Suu Kyi, and
has arrested several thousand other dissidents, according to
Western sources.
   The two students initially threatened to blow up the aircraft
with what Thai officials say was a homemade explosive.
   Thailand is one of the few nations which has tried to establish
friendly ties with the military regime and has shown particular
interest in exploiting Burma's rich natural resources, including
teak and fish. Thailand's powerful military has been at the
forefront of efforts to develop closer ties.
