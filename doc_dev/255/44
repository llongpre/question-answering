   Burmese troops on Friday shelled a
rebel stronghold in the offensive to crush a 40-year-old insurgency
in eastern Karen state, a Thai border patrol officer reported.
   He said soldiers peppered the Kaw Moo Ra camp rebel camp, just
across the Moei River from Thailand, with mortar shells.
   The officer, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
estimated that about 1,200 Karen guerrillas are defending the camp
against about 3,000 soldiers.
   Government forces began shelling Kaw Moo Ra on Thursday, two
days after overrunning the major rebel base of Wangkha, 1{ miles to
the south.
   Wangkha was the fifth Karen strongold to be captured by army
units since the government launched an offensive in December.
   A government spokesman told a news conference Friday in Rangoon,
the Burmese capital, that at least 43 rebels were killed in the
battle for Wangkha. He said 35 soldiers were killed and 95 wounded.
   The Burmese government has said 600 guerrillas and 177 soldiers
perished in the battle for Maela _ the last camp to fall before
Wangkha.
   The five captured camps are in a 75-mile arc hugging the border
along Thailand's Mae Sot district.
   Kaw Moo Ra is 140 miles east of Rangoon and across the border
from the Thai town of Mae Sot.
   Thai officials say the government offensive has disrupted the
cross-border black market trade that provided the Karens with funds
for their insurgency. The Karen National Union has an estimated
4,000 combatants and is the largest of a dozen ethnic groups
battling the Burmese government.
   Karens began their revolt in 1949, a year after Burma achieved
independence from Great Britain, saying the government reneged on
its promise of more autonomy for ethnic minorities.
   The Karen rebels gained unexpected support when thousands of
students joined them after the bloody crackdown by the government
on student-led campaigns for democracy.
   On Thursday, Burmese government spokesman Kyaw Sann said 3,056
students have returned home from border areas and legal action
would be taken against those who remained with the rebels.
