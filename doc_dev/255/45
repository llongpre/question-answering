   Karen guerrillas have recaptured
outposts seized by Burmese government troops more than four years
ago, a rebel official said today.
   The rebels Wednesday captured several hills at Methawaw on the
western bank of the Moei River that separates Burma and Thailand,
said the official who asked not to be named. Fighting for the
strategic hills began Sept. 26.
   The Karens, the strongest armed opponents of the Rangoon
government, lost the area in April 1984 to the Burmese army.
   The Karen official also said rebel camps on the Thai border were
preparing for government attacks.
   Burmese leader Gen. Saw Maung ``regards us as his enemy so his
orders may involve more attacks on our camps,'' he said, referring
to Thay Baw Bo and Kle Day camps that house more than 4,000
students and other Burmese.
   Students were at the forefront of recent, pro-democracy
demonstrations in Burma, but were driven underground by Saw Maung's
troops, who by official count have killed about 450 people since a
Sept. 18 military coup.
   Several thousand have fled to the Thai-Burmese border seeking
refuge and military training from ethnic minorities, including the
Karens, who are also fighting the central governemnt.
   The official said he had no details on casualty figures and
reported no fighting today between the rebels and the army.
   ``We didn't encircle them this time because that involves heavy
losses of lives on both sides,'' he said. ``For retreat, we left
them a way out.''
