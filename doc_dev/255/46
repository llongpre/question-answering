  [Text] Thailand will accelerate the repatriation of the 
remaining 25,000 Hmongs and Laotians at the country's last 
Indochinese refugee camp at Nakhon Phanom so the camp can be 
closed by the end of this year. 
  Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary-general of the 
National Security Council [NSC], told a press conference 
yesterday that the Thai government had no policy of allowing the 
settlement of any refugees and that it would try to reduce the 
number of border camps, with the last one holding Indochinese 
refugees, at Ban Na Pho in Nakhon Phanom province, to go by the 
end of this year. 
  Refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border were closed early 
last year when hundreds of thousands of Khmer refugees were sent 
home after the UN-sponsored peace settlement in the war-torn 
nation. 
  However, border camps still exist on the western frontier 
with Burma where several tens of thousands of refugees are 
taking shelter as a result of four decades of civil war between 
the Burmese Army and various anti-Rangoon ethnic minorities. 
  Laos, Thailand and the UNHCR agreed in June 1991 to 
repatriate all Laotian refugees within three years. But so far 
only 8,619 have been sent home under the tripartite effort, 
leaving another 25,000 stranded in Thailand due to difficulties 
on the part of Laos and the UNHCR, Khachatphai said. 
  He said he had urged Laos and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to find new approaches to 
expedite the repatriation process. Of the 25,000 refugees, 
22,000 are highland Hmong. 
  Many difficulties, such as a lack of repatriation funds on 
the part of the UNHCR, and the lack of basic infrastructure and 
suitable relocation sites in Laos, have slowed the process, 
according to the NSC chief. 
  Khachatphai has tried to encourage the repatriation process 
by pointing to the easing of ideological conflicts in Laos. He 
said Vientiane, apart from its repeated guarantee of returnees' 
safety against government reprisals, has also stated that it 
wants the returnees to help develop the landlocked nation. 
  He said the UNHCR would provide assistance to the returnees 
as well as help them resettle in their preferred community. 
  This morning a group of over 400 Hmong refugees, the largest 
such group to be returned so far this year, will be repatriated 
overland to Laos via the newly opened Thai-Lao Bridge, he added.
