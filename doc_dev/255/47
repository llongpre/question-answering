   Eighty students who fled Burma after
participating in pro-democracy protests that were crushed in a
military coup returned home Tuesday to an emotional welcome from
their families.
   The students, the first to be repatriated under an agreement
between Thailand and Burma, were flown to Burma from a Thai camp in
Tak, near the border.
   Students led the demonstrations that swept Burma this year and
ended with the Sept. 18 military coup.
   On Monday, Burmese air force planes took the students,
accompanied by journalists, to their hometowns in various parts of
the country. Eight students from the Rangoon area returned by car
and train.
   The commander of the Rangoon military division, Brig. Myo Nyunt,
told the youths to regard their experience as a lesson in choosing
between good and bad.
   Sixteen students rejoined their parents at a reception ceremony
at the airport in Heho, in eastern Shan State.
   The father of Tha Kyaw Myint thanked the authorities for bringing
his 20-year-old son back and asked them also to bring back his
second son from Thailand.
   In the central town of Meiktila, the two sisters of Maung Dipar
wept as they welcomed their brother. Their father, a bank employee,
died in a car accident last month on his way to find his son.
   About 7,000 other students remain along the Thai-Burmese
frontier, where they sought refuge and military training with
anti-government guerrillas living in the jungle.
