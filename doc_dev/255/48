   Burmese forces launched a fierce
assault on ethnic Karen rebels near the Thai border, but they were
forced to retreat, Thai police said Monday. At least 44 people were
reported killed.
   The border police and Karen sources said the dead included 42
government soldiers. They said only two rebels were killed and one
was wounded.
   The attack was the heaviest and most sustained since Burmese
troops began their assault on the Karen base of Kaw Moo Ra in May,
the police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Burmese troops began pounding the base with mortar fire Saturday
before launching the infantry assault, police said. They pulled
back Sunday after taking heavy casualties, they said.
   Police said the camp, about five miles from the Thai border town
of Mae Sot, is defended by about 1,200 Karens. There was no
indication how many Burmese troops were involved in the attack.
   The Karens, with about 8,000 fighters, are the largest of 12
ethnic minority groups that have fought a four-decade war for
greater autonomy from the central government.
   Kaw Moo Ra, situated along a curve of the Moei River, can be
attacked from Burma only with artillery or by a frontal assault on
a well-defended 250-yard strip of land between the two bends in the
river.
   Thai gunners fired 15 warning shots at a Burmese government
mortar base in hills near the camp after about 80 mortar rounds
fell inside Thai territory at the village of Ban Wang Kaew, police
said.
   Burmese troops burned the Thai village at the end of May, when
they intruded into Thailand to attack Kaw Moo Ra from the rear.
   Last year, the Burmese army began a campaign to dislodge the
Karens from riverbank strongholds where they have controlled
cross-border trade. Burmese troops have seized five key bases since
December.
   The Burmese government wants to clear routes through
Karen-controlled territory to allow the passage of export goods,
mainly timber, into Thailand.
   The Karens say the government has paid a heavy price for its
victories. They claim to have killed at least 2,000 government
soldiers and wounded 4,000. They gave no total for their own
casualties.
   Thai border forces said earlier in the campaign that Karen
casualties were much lighter than those of the government.
