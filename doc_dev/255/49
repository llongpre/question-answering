Celebrate General Bo Mya's 67th Birthday"] 
  [Text] The Moei and Salween rivers dividing Thailand and 
Burma from Tak to Mae Hong Son Provinces were full of activity. 
The noise of long-tail boats was deafening as boat after boat 
skimmed along the rivers while passengers chatted away. 
  This was not a normal scene. During the war when there were 
only the sound of gunfire and the smell of gunsmoke not many 
people dared to use the rivers. 
  However, since the Burmese Government ceased military 
operations in the Karen State in April 1992, the atmosphere has 
changed and more people have since traveled this route. 
  These extraordinary events took place as the Karens living 
on 
the banks of the Moei and Salween rivers came to the Manerplaw 
Headquarters of General Bo Mya, president of the Karen National 
Union [KNU], located on the banks of the Moei river about 50 km 
north of Ban Mae Tawo pier in Tha Song Yang District, Tak 
Province. Many also came by foot from across nearby mountains. 
  They Karens came to celebrate the 67th birthday of Gen. Bo 
Mya on 20 January, to express their loyalty, and convey their 
greetings to the man they regard as the leader of the Karens. A 
minority group, the Karens have waged a protracted struggle 
against the Burmese Government, and every year they have only 
few days for such joyous activities. 
  The grounds of the Manerplaw camp was thronged by people 
from 
the evening of 19 January, the first day of the celebrations. 
There were 11 folk performances, most of which were meant to 
arouse patriotic feelings. The performers totaled in the 
hundreds, and those who satisfied the organizing committee would 
receive several thousand bahts in reward. 
  Lasting over half the night, the performances were a prelude 
to the celebrations. 
  The next morning before the fog cleared, thousands were 
already gathered in great anticipation. Gen. Bo Mya and his 
family sat on the stage waiting for the ceremonies to take place. 
  A Buddhist ceremony performed by about 10 Karen monks 
started 
off the occasion. Then, Karen student leaders of various levels 
sang greetings to the melodies of church hymns, praising the 
revered leader. 
  Then, for almost an hour, Karens representatives who lived 
too far away to attend the celebrations, read their greetings. 
  Next came a party representing several Karen groups under 
the 
control of Gen. Bo Mya along the Thai-Burmese border from Mae 
Hong Son to Ranong Provinces. They included the All Burma 
Student Democratic Front [ABSDF] representatives from Dawngwin 
camp, Karen alliance groups, and even Thai logging firm 
operators. They lined up to hand gifts to Gen. Bo Mya. 
  As with earlier years, most of the gifts were blankets, a 
necessity not only for Gen. Bo Mya but for Karen soldiers in the 
field as well. Gen. Bo Mya then blew out the candles and cut 
the big cake given by his men. 
  Next came what all Karens eagerly waited for -- Gen. Bo 
Mya's address. The address in Karen was translated into English 
sentence by sentence. His address seemed to reflect his 
sincerity and long experience of the struggle. It was full of 
substance and determination and was punctuated by occasional 
applause from the big audience. 
  That concluded the official ceremonies. 
  In the afternoon, attendants gathered on the edge of the 
field which was used as a boxing ring. Boxing is the favorite 
sport of Karens of all ages, and all of them waited eagerly for 
the event. The event began with fights between volunteers, who 
were picked by referees on the spot. Some boxers were only 
about 100 cm tall. Foreign visitors were surprised by the 
enthusiasm of these boxers. There were many willing boxers and 
all the referee had to do was to give the signal. 
  There was no fixed length for a match. The pair displaying 
skills that pleased the cheering crowd would be allowed to fight 
longer. The boxers fought viciously. There would be two 
referees in each match to ensure that a boxer would not be taken 
unfair advantage by the other. Some matches were so exciting 
that they had to be interrupted for other matches before 
resuming. 
  After the match, each boxer would be given bunches of 
20-baht 
and 100-baht notes by the referees as a prize. 
  As dusk approached, the audience began to disperse and the 
boxing matches, which evidently projected a quality of the 
Karens, ended. This quality is their fighting and sporting 
spirit. They love boxing and they do not bet on matches. There 
were no shouts offering odds during matches as would be the case 
in Thailand. Gambling and alcohol are strictly prohibited in 
Karen land. 
  Karens participants of the celebrations waited for the night 
of 20 January, for "Li Ke Karen" [Karen folk play] which was 
held on the same field. These people thoroughly enjoyed each 
other and the play. The next day everything returned to normal 
at Manerplaw camp, and those who came from afar returned to 
their homes, while camp members would resume their normal daily 
chores. 
  Many agreed that the attendance at this year's celebrations 
was smaller than previous years. Not many dared to offer 
reasons, but some claimed that Gen. Bo Mya's influence had 
declined and so he had less interests to be exploited. In any 
event, this seemed to be the current situation with the Karen 
general. 
  In mid 1993 there were attempts by certain Burmese minority 
groups, such as the Kachin, the Wa, Shan, Pa-O, and other 
groups, to seek a cease-fire with the Burmese Government. There 
was a report that the Karens and the Burmese Government would 
negotiate a cease-fire in early 1994. The world is following 
the outcome of this event closely. 
  However, Gen. Bo Mya recently said: "The negotiations 
between 
the Karen and the Burmese did not take place. If a negotiation 
is to take place, it is likely to be held in a third country, 
possibly Thailand. First the Thai Government will have to give 
its consent. The Karens have not approached the Thai Government 
on this matter. The KNU will have to hold internal consultations 
on the timing of the negotiation. 
  "On our part, we will negotiate with the Burmese military 
government, but the negotiations must cover every political 
field, such as freedom and the liberty of minority citizens and 
political issues. We feel that there must be negotiations with 
every group, including the revolutionary group and the Burmese 
people. This will result in peace in the country. If the 
negotiation involves only the KNU, peace will probably not 
materialize nationwide." 
  Regarding the attempt by certain minority groups to seek 
negotiations with the Burmese Government: 
  "Those groups do not uphold correct political principle. 
Their action amounts to a surrender or a subjugation of 
themselves to the enemy without undertaking political 
negotiations to resolve the people's problems. The minority 
groups that participated in cease-fire negotiations are groups 
that have no political ideology." 
  On this, Nai Aung, president of the ABSDF, whose command 
post 
is located on the bank of Salween river, opposite Ban Mae 
Samlap, Sop Moei subdistrict, Mae Hong Son, and who participated 
in the celebrations of Gen. Bo Mya's birthday, said: 
  "The Burmese military government will negotiate with each of 
the minority groups in the format that it wants. This is no 
problem, providing that the negotiations deal with solutions to 
the political problems, to freedom and liberty problems, and 
diversities among the different minority groups. If these 
negotiations succeed, other minority groups will benefit as 
well. In any event, the students have not negotiated with the 
Burmese Government." 
  An issue that occupied great attention was the projected 
construction of dams on the Moei and Salween rivers by the Thai 
and Burmese Governments. The project will result in the areas 
on both banks of the rivers being submerged. The Karen forces 
and the student group occupy the Burmese side of the rivers. 
  On this issue, Gen. Bo Mya clearly opposed the project. 
  He said: "The construction of the dams will definitely 
affect 
us. Farmland will be lost. Our people will suffer. Most 
importantly, our areas of operation will be curtailed. So far, 
we have written to the World Bank and the free governments to 
help them understand the picture so that they will not support 
the project." 
  What if this effort fails? 
  "If our appeals fail we will resort to violence to stop it." 
  Meanwhile, Nai Aung said: 
  "We do not support dams on the Moei and Salween rivers. The 
student group will write their about the opposition to the dams 
to international organizations, environmental conservation 
groups, and international humanitarian groups to inform them 
that the project will destroy natural resources and human 
rights. Thailand may want to solve its domestic energy problem, 
but we have our problems too." 
  "If our opposition does not succeed, we will resort to 
violence in our territory to block the construction. That is 
our last resort." 
  Now that the direction and objectives of the two individuals 
who are allied in the struggle against the Burmese Govrnment are 
the same, the situation in the Salween river along the 
Thai-Burmese border is clear. Whether they choose peace or 
violence will depend on the future conditions.
