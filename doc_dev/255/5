<HEAD>More Burmese Students Return Under Controversial Program</HEAD>

   Twenty-eight Burmese students returned home
Saturday under a controversial program in which Thailand repatriates
people who fled last year's bloody military crackdown in Burma.
   The flight brought to 320 the number of students and other
Burmese who have returned under the program, which was established
last month by the Thai and Burmese military.
   Only one Burmese remained at the repatriation center at
Thailand's northern city of Tak, a 20-year-old student hospitalized
with malaria, Thai officials said.
   The Burmese had fled to Thai border areas controlled by
anti-government guerrillas, seeking refuge after the September
military coup in Burma and the ruthless suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   Under the Thai-Burmese program, they are brought to the Tak
center, then flown to Burma's capital of Rangoon aboard Burmese
military planes.
   Interviewed upon arrival in Rangoon, chemistry student Kyaw Kyaw
Aung said many students from the border areas were expected to reach
the Tak camp in a few days.
   Asked about allegations they were being forced back to Burma,
another student, Maung Nay Win, said: ``We were looked after very
well by the Thai Red Cross, like their children. There was no threat
or pressure to force us back to Burma. We returned at our own
volition.''
   Other students have told reporters, however, that they would
remain in Thailand if they could.
   Both the Thai and Burmese governments have denied charges by
Amnesty International that Thailand forced back 22 students on Jan.
7 and that some of them were arrested when they arrived in Burma.
