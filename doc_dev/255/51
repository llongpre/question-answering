   Hundreds of Karen guerrillas, joined by
students who fled government repression in major cities, today
battled Burmese troops trying to retake this base near the Thai
border, guerrilla commanders said.
   The students, numbering about 130, recently joined the guerrillas
in front-line fighting for the first time, said the commanders, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The rebel leaders said the students received four weeks of
military training from the ethnic minority Karens, who have for four
decades been waging a war for greater autonomy.
   More than 5,000 students and other protestors fled to the Karens
after a military coup Sept. 18 and a ruthless suppression of a
``people's power'' uprising in which more than 450 people died.
   The students, along with as many as 1,000 guerrillas of the Karen
National Union, are trying to beat back Burmese reinforcements
attempting to retake several hills around the camp, the guerrilla
commanders said.
   Mae Tah Waw is on a key Karen transport and communications route,
where the Karens tax the massive smuggling trade between Thailand
and Burma that includes gems, consumer items, antiques, livestock
and teak.
   The battle for Mae Tah Waw began in early October when the Karens
launched attacks against the encampment and a series of surrounding
hills that the Burmese army captured in 1984.
   The camp, located on the Moei River about 80 miles north of the
key Thai border town of Mae Sot, had until then been inhabited by an
unknown number of Karen civilians and guerrillas.
   The Karens seized the Burmese base and three hills in the third
week of October and were attempting to dislodge remnants from a
fourth when, according to President Bo Mya of the Karen National
Union, the Burmese moved in 10 battalions of reinforcements in
recent days.
   The Burmese force, strung out westward into thickly jungled
country, is estimated at 2,000 to 3,000.
   Most of the 130 students were reported counter-attacking the
reinforcements.
   ``We need more weapons,'' operation commander Gen. Hla Thoo told
reporters. He said the students would relieve Karen guerrillas and
use their rifles since there were not enough to go around.
   In recent days, the Karens have been ferrying in their own
reinforcements on motor launches along the Moei River, which forms
the border between Thailand and Burma here.
   The students have vowed to wage war against the Rangoon
government, which sent troops into the streets of Burma's cities to
gun down demonstrators and put an end to a pro-democracy movement
that reached its height in July.
   Also today, Thailand's deputy foreign minister, Prapas
Limpabandhu, said he will visit Burma for trade and border talks
this month, breaking the international isolation of the new military
government.
   Prapas will be leading the first official foreign delegation to
Burma since military commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power in the
Sept. 18 coup.
   The world community has informally cooperated in refraining from
any moves that would imply formal recognition of the Saw Maung
government.
   Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila said Prapa's visit did not
necessarily mean Thailand will recognize the current government.
