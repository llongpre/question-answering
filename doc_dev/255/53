<HEAD>Burmese Rebels Welcome Call For Peace Talks</HEAD>

   Burmese guerrillas waging a 40-year war
for greater autonomy today welcomed their government's reported
willingness to negotiate a cease-fire.
   Thailand's army chief, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, said
Wednesday that Burma has accepted in principle a Thai proposal to
mediate peace talks.
   There has been no immediate comment from the Rangoon government,
which late last year began intensifying its offensive against the
rebels.
   A Bangkok-based official of the National Democratic Front, which
combines 10 ethnic minority rebel groups and claims to control half
of Burma, said the group does not trust the Rangoon government of
Gen. Saw Maung. ``But if there is a chance (for peace), we must
take that chance,'' he said.
   ``Maybe with the pressure of the outside world or mediators,
there can be something coming out that is positive,'' said the
official.
   A representative of the Karen National Union, the largest
guerrilla group, said, ``A cease-fire is no problem. We are ready
... but we cannot believe in killers.'' Both officials asked not to
be named.
   Rangoon's troops have been hitting particularly hard at Karen
bases along the Thai frontier. Their offensive drew criticism from
U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), who charged the Burmese
army attacks rebel bases without regard for the presence of
civilians.
   In a statement received in Bangkok today, Moynihan welcomed
Thailand's offer to mediate in the world's oldest civil war.
   ``It is my hope that Thailand will play a neutral and
constructive role ... and will quickly facilitate a cease-fire
among the warring parties,'' Moynihan wrote. He said negotiations
eventually should lead to free elections and discussions about a
federated union.
   Bangkok's proposal came after Burmese troops Saturday intruded
into Thailand's northern Tak province to attack a Karen base. The
soldiers occupied a Thai village and burned its marketplace before
being forced back.
   Burma's army commander, Lt. Gen. Than Shwe, told the Thai
delegation on Tuesday he regretted the incursion. But he also asked
Bangkok not to allow insurgents to take refuge in Thailand.
   Bangkok hopes to expand trade with Burma in line with Prime
Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's campaign to turn Southeast Asian
``battlefields into marketplaces.''
