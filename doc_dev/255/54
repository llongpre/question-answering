  [Text] Khun Sa has mobilized his forces to encircle 
Burmese Government troops and is trying to recapture Chot Town. 
In the ensuing battle four Khun Sa soldiers were killed, at 
least 15 Burmese soldiers were believed killed, and there were 
many casualties. The latest report says that Khun Sa's men have 
succeeded in recapturing five bases. 
  Shan State, 11 May -- Four days ago Burmese Government 
forces 
attacked a Khun Sa stronghold and captured seven military bases 
on Doi Hinpong, opposite Thailand's Wiang Haeng District, Chiang 
Mai province. On the day of the loss of the bases, the Khun Sa 
troops encircled the Burmese soldiers in the captured bases, 
triggering heavy fighting along the Thai-Burmese border opposite 
Thailand's Ban Piang Luang, Wiang Haeng District. 
  A report says the 250-strong Khun Sa force attacked the 
Burmese Government force in the bases on Doi Hinpong in Chot 
Town, about 20 km from the Thai border and recaptured five of 
the bases. 
  A report on the fighting by the Thai Task Force 327 in Wiang 
Haeng District said four Khun Sa soldiers were killed and many 
wounded. Some of the wounded were taken for treatement to a 
hospital in Ban Maisung, a Khun Sa liberated area. Some were 
sent to the district hospital in Wiang Haeng District. The 
casualties on the Burmese Government side were estimated at no 
less than 15 killed. 
  According to Prince Khunduan Saengkham, the secretary 
general 
of the Shan State restoration council, the Khun Sa soldiers have 
been deployed in Tuan and Chang Towns and have completely 
encircled Chot Town. An attack on the Burmese Government 
soldiers was expected soon. 
  The prince said: "We have hired about 20 small buses in Ban 
Piang Luang to transport soldiers to reinforce the front line 
and move the wounded soldiers to the district hospital in Wiang 
Haeng District."
