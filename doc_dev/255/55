  [Text] Kanchanaburi -- The New Mon State Party [NMSP] 
headquarters, on the Thai-Burmese border opposite Sangkhla Buri 
District of this western province, could be attacked any day now 
by Burmese army troops, an NMSP source said yesterday. 
  The source told the BANGKOK POST that two Burmese army 
battalions of about 800 soldiers had set up positions near the 
NMSP headquarters at Baho and appeared poised for an attack. 
  The 104th and 433rd Battalions from Tavoy township had been 
located near Ale Sakan village, only about 30 kilometres south 
of the NMSP headquarters. 
  The two infantry battalions are believed to be poised for an 
attack, the source said. 
  The NMSP headquarters is located about 50 kilometres south 
of 
the Three Pagoda Pass. 
  The evacuation of Mon ethnic refugees from Lo Loe Camp in 
Sangkhla Buri District to a new camp at Hlakhani in Burma has 
continued. About 300 Mon refugees were moved to the new camp 
yesterday. 
  About 8,000 Mon refugees had been housed at Loh Loe camp, 
and 
about 5,000 of them have been moved to the new camp since last 
month. 
  The Mon believe that Thailand wants to please Burma so that 
in cooperation with the Petroleum Authority of Thailand they can 
lay a gas pipeline from the coastal town of Amherst in Burma to 
Kanchanaburi Province.
