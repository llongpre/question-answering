   A U.S. citizen working for the magazine
Soldier of Fortune died today of gunshot and shrapnel wounds after
he was caught in fighting on Burma's border with Thailand, police
sources said.
   Lance Eugene Motley, 32, was brought to Mae Sot hospital Tuesday
night and died this morning, medical staff at the hospital said.
His hometown was not known immediately.
   Police said Motley apparently crossed into Burma three days ago
with Karen rebels and went to their camp at Kaw Moo Ra, which has
been besieged by Burmese troops since May 18.
   Fighting has been raging in jungle areas of this border region
since Burmese troops launched an intensive offensive last October
against rebels fighting for autonomy from the central government.
   Free-lance journalist Alan Dawson, who is based in Bangkok, said
he met Motley after the American arrived in Thailand three weeks
ago. He said Motley told him he was a correspondent for Soldier of
Fortune and had worked in the past in Central America.
   Dawson said Motley planned to base himself in Bangkok to cover
Southeast Asia for the monthly magazine, which is based in Colorado
and specializes in combat and weaponry.
   ``He had never been out of the American hemisphere and was very
eager to see what was happening in this part of the world,'' Dawson
said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Neil Klopfenstein said only that an
American citizen died this morning ``after an incident on the
Thai-Burma border.'' He refused to release details.
   The medical sources, who asked not to be named, said Motley was
brought to the hospital with gunshot and shrapnel wounds to the
face and body.
