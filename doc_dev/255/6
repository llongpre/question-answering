   About 2,000 members of the Karen minority in
Burma have fled to Thailand following intensified attacks by Burmese
troops against their rebel camps along the border, a senior police
officer said today.
   Reporters in the area said ten civilians of the Karen _ one of a
dozen ethnic minority groups in Burma _ were wounded by Burmese
mortar attacks that began Sunday.
   Police Col. Amphon Ngamchit, superintendant of Tak province, said
Thai authorities allowed the refugees to remain on the Thai side of
the Moei River, which marks the border, but prevented them from
going deeper into Thailand.
   Amphon said about 1,000 Burmese troops backed by mortars were
attacking about 500 Karen guerrillas opposite the Thai district of
Tha Song Yang in Tak.
   In recent months, the Burmese army has stepped up its attacks
against the Karen, retaking the border village of Mae Tha Waw and
disrupting the rebels' main source of revenue _ a lucrative
smuggling trade between Burma and Thailand.
   The Karen National Union fields about 4,000 guerrillas and is
regarded as the strongest of a dozen ethnic rebel organizations
fighting the Rangoon government. It operates along the Thai-Burmese
border.
   Meanwhile, Radio Moscow quoted a Burmese government spokesman as
denying that Soviet military personnel had operated with the Burmese
army in the recent battle for Mae Tha Waw. The Karens claim Soviet
advisers helped the Burmese, especially in mounting deadly artillery
strikes against the Karen.
