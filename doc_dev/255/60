  [Text] Heavy fighting continued between Khun Sa's army and 
Burmese troops in Shan State close to the Thai border. 
According to a latest report, Burma sent 10 battalions more of 
reinforcements in an attempt to retake Mong Chot. 
  A reliable source reported to MATICHON on 23 May that, 
during 
the night of 22 May, 10 battalions of the 23d brigade, with its 
stronghold west of Salween River and about 8 kilometers from 
Mong Chot, mounted an offensive against Khun Sa's soldiers and 
managed to take back the military stronghold at Mong Chot at 
dawn on 23 May. There was no report on the casualties of both 
sides, but Khun Sa's men reportedly pulled back from Mong Chot 
toward Doi Na Mu and Doi Nam Cham. 
  As for the situation in Chiang Mai, MATICHON's correspondent 
reported intense fighting at the border in Wiang Haeng, Mae Ai, 
and Fang Districts in Chiang Mai. There was also fierce 
fighting opposite Muang District of Mae Hong Son Province, about 
10 kilometers from the Thai-Burmese border, with the two sides 
pounding artillery fire on each other continuously. 
  The source reported that troops of Khun Sa advanced toward 
Thachilek-Napong and, in the past two days, launched three 
attacks on Burmese Government troops, killing and wounding many. 
They apparently wanted to capture Thachilek. The Burmese 
border pass at Thachilek opposite Mae Sai in Chiang Rai was 
closed, as the Burmese military was recruiting men to be porters 
and soldiers. It also wanted to black out news about the 
situation in Burma to keep it from leaking to the Thai side. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Kansai Chaiyen, a leading member of the Shan 
State Restoration Council, said the Burmese Government proposed 
a cease-fire negotiation after three weeks of fighting. Burma 
claimed that several factions of Khun Sa's army had already 
agreed to a cease-fire negotiation. However, the Shan State 
Restoration Council made it clear that there would be a 
negotiation only when Burmese troops had pulled out from Shan 
State, and that the negotiation be conducted in a country other 
than Burma.
