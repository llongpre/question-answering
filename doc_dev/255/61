  [Text] Fighting between rival forces of Rangoon government 
troops and minority rebel forces of Khun Sa would have no effect 
on Thai people living along the Thai-Burmese border according to 
Third Army Corps commander Panthep Phuwanatnuluk. 
  He gave his personal assurance that army rangers positioned 
in Mae Ai of Chiang Mai and Mae Chan of Chiang Rai would be 
ready to provide protection to the villagers if fighting spills 
into Thailand. 
  Lt-Gen Panthep yesterday inspected the preparation of 
rangers 
and listened to a briefing about the general situation at the 
Ban Rak Thai border base in Mae Chan District. 
  An official report said some 3,000 Mong Thai Army (MTA) 
soldiers of warlord Khun Sa based in Mong Kan opposite Mae Chan 
District are facing some 4,500 troops of the United Wa State 
Army (UWSA) near Doi Lang opposite Mae Ai District. 
  Fighting might erupt at any moment because the MTA wants to 
seize some parts of Mong Yon which is under the influence of the 
UWSA, the report said. 
  The report also said that several battalions of Burmese 
government soldiers heading for Mong Kan have stopped their 
advance because they believe that the MTA might attack Tachilek 
township opposite Mae Sai District.
