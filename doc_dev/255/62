   Heavy shells fired by Burmese
government forces crashed into neighboring Thailand on Saturday for
a second straight day, Thai police said.
   Police spokesman Lt. Omnard Khamouraijust said authorities
believe the shells, which hit the frontier town of Tha Song Yang,
were aimed at a base of the Karen guerrilla group just across the
border in Burma.
   One Karen rebel was killed along the border and two Thai
civilians in Tha Song Yang were injured Friday when the shelling
set their homes ablaze, he said.
   At least 1,000 artillery and mortar rounds landed in the town
center Friday, Omnard said. The shelling continued Saturday evening.
   The bombardment destroyed the town hall, a police box and at
least 20 houses. Tha Song Yang is in northern Tak province,
bordering western Burma.
   Thai forces Friday fired flares, then two artillery rounds, to
signal to Burmese troops that they had struck Thai territory, said
Tha Song Yang police Col. Taepo Trichana. But the Burmese shelling
did not cease, he said.
   Town chief Punsak Pranutnorapane said officials Friday evacuated
3,000 residents to police regional headquarters 1{ miles away.
Patients in the city hospital were moved to a hospital in a nearby
town.
   The Karens are among a dozen guerrilla groups fighting for
greater autonomy from the Burmese government.
