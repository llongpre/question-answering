  [Excerpt] A KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT correspondent filed a 
report on his recent visit to Shan State, the territory under 
control of Khun Sa, a world-renowned heroin producer. He said 
he could hear the sounds of gunfire from the fighting between 
the Burmese and ethnic minority forces along the Thai-Burmese 
border in Mae Hong Son Province. He also reported that many 
young men aged between 10 and 15 are receiving military 
training. Boys are drafted into the Shan Army when they reach 
15 years of age. 
  From Saengchai Saengchu, the Khan Sa group's assistant 
coordinator for civilian affairs, he learned that in early 1994 
the Burmese Government spent $1 billion to buy 14 Mirage 
aircraft from China. The Chinese Mirage is a copy of the 
Russian version. 
  Saengchai said: "We have information that the Burmese 
Government paid 40 percent of the cost of the Mirage in cash. 
The aircraft will be used to suppress antigovernment minority 
groups. The Burmese Government obtained money from signing away 
fishing, gem mining, and logging concessions. The remaining 60 
percent could be paid to China by allowing it to build a highway 
from Mandalay to Rangoon and a large seaport to give China a new 
access to the sea." 
  Saengchai said his information is that not all the planes 
will be used against Khun Sa forces. Most of them will be 
targetted against the Karen rebel group who controls the area 
opposite Thailand's Mae Sariang District and Tak Province. Two 
of the planes have already been shot down by Karen rebels. 
  Shan State leader Khun Sa, however, said he was not 
frightened by Burmese Government's purchase of Chinese planes to 
suppress rebellious minority groups. His forces have 
antiaircraft guns and SAM-7 rockets to deal with these planes. 
His men have also been instructed to build protective shelters. 
  Khun Sa said: "We have hired foreign technicians. We are now 
able to produce RPG's. Although their quality is not that good, 
they will be able to shoot down Burmese planes because the 
planes are an older model and have low capabilities. They also 
have a short flying period because of their small fuel tanks." 
Moreover, Khun Sa said he now has 47,000 soldiers after the 
training of the 27th batch in early 1994. Another batch of 
4,000 have already started the 28th training cycle. Another 
7,000 is expected to be trained in the 29th cycle and another 
8,000 in the 30th cycle. He expects that by the end of this 
year his forces will grow by another 20,000 men. This size will 
be sufficient to fight the Burmese Government soldiers. [passage
