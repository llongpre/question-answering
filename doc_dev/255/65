  [Text] The supreme commander has confirmed the plan to 
deport to Laos all Hmong who have taken refuge at Wat Tham 
Krabok in Sara Buri Province. Supreme Commander Air Chief 
Marshal Woranat Aphichari said the military has been 
coordinating with the Interior Ministry to identify the illegal 
immigrants who fled from refugee centers to Tham Krabok. 
Concerning General Vang Pao, the supreme commander said legal 
action will be taken if he returns to Thailand to pursue 
subversive activities. The supreme commander explained that the 
measure taken by the military followed a government order, which 
wants to preserve good relations with the neighboring country. 
  [Begin Woranat recording] We have filed charges against him. 
This is aimed at preventing Gen. Vang Pao from entering our 
country. He will be arrested at the immigration checkpoint if 
he tries to enter the country. Concerning the next steps we 
will take, I do not think we can reveal them because that would 
affect the efficiency of our plan. [end recording] 
  Asked about the attacks on Thai fishing boats by Burmese 
soldiers off Ranong Province which resulted in a number of Thai 
fishermen being killed, the supreme commander said officials 
concerned are gathering information about the incident for use 
at the next meeting of the Thai-Burmese border committee. 
Meanwhile, Thailand must try to solve its own problem by 
preventing Thai fishermen from encroaching into the waters of 
other countries.
