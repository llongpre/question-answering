   More than 200 Burmese have fled into
bordering Thailand, saying they feared arrest and persecution by
the military regime that has seized power in their country,
officials said today.
   After escaping in motor launches from Victoria Point, Burma's
southernmost area, 108 Burmese students who ``felt their lives were
threatened'' arrived in the Thai city of Ranong on Sunday night,
Lt. Col. Sanit Komolvanich said.
   ``We are not turning them around today because we also fear for
their safety,'' Ranong's immigration chief said. ``They are being
detained until the situation returns to normal and then they all
must go back.''
   Another 101 students, Buddhist monks and others sought refuge in
the northern Thai border town of Mae Sot, crossing a frontier river
in boats or trekking on foot in heavy monsoon rains, district
official Niyom Jaikaew said.
   Authorities housed the refugees in a Buddhist temple, provided
food and urged them to return, Niyom said. He said 70 left late
Monday and the rest returned to Burma today.
   Students and monks have been at the forefront of massive
demonstrations to topple Burma's authoritarian government, but the
military stepped in over the weekend and ousted civilian President
Maung Maung.
   A senior immigration official in the northern Thai town of Mae
Sai said turmoil in Burma has reduced the usually busy border
trade, most of it conducted illegally between Thai merchants and
Burmese smugglers providing consumer goods for Burma's vast black
market.
