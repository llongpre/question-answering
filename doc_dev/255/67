  [Text] Thailand yesterday invited Burmese Foreign Minister 
Ohn Gyaw on an official visit to Bangkok as guest of the Foreign 
Ministry. The visit is separate to that for the ASEAN meeting 
in July. 
  "We extended the invitation to Burmese Foreign Minister U 
Ohn 
Gyaw to visit Thailand, and hope to meet him in July at the 
meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers," said Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Suwit Simasakun after hour-long talks between Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Burmese counterpart. 
  Thailand also informed Burma members of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations were considering its status at the ASEAN 
foreign ministers meeting due to take place in Bangkok, he said. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said his visit was not intended simply to 
extend an invitation to Rangoon but was aimed at explaining the 
whole ASEAN process and to assess the situation in Burma. 
  He said Burma had given a "very" positive response to his 
approach for Rangoon's participation at the July meeting. 
  It not has not been decided what status Burma should be 
offered in joining the meeting since Thailand has to consult 
further with other ASEAN members, the Foreign Minister said. 
  ASEAN senior officials last month raised no objections to 
Thailand inviting Burma as a "guest of the host country". 
  Burma also expressed interest in Thailand's initiative to 
organise a 10-nation meeting which would not be under the 
framework of ASEAN, said Sqn Ldr Prasong. 
  The meeting plans to bring together the six ASEAN countries, 
three Indochinese states--Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam--and Burma. 
The idea was raised by Sqn Ldr Prasong in an attempt to speed up 
the integration of the 10 Southeast Asian nations. 
  The Foreign Minister arrived in Rangoon yesterday for a 
two-day visit in the capacity of chairman of the ASEAN Standing 
Committee and Thailand's foreign minister. 
  On bilateral issues, the two sides agreed to hold a second 
meeting of the Thai-Burmese Joint Commission in September in 
Bangkok, the spokesman said. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said Thailand and Burma also agreed to 
discuss in detail the construction, use and management of a 
bridge across the Moei River from Mae Sot in Tak province to 
Burma's Myawaddy. 
  A technical team will be discussed as soon as possible to 
settle all details to facilitate construction, he said. 
  The Cabinet early this year approved construction of the 
bridge. 
  Burma has agreed to reconsider Thailand's request to reduce 
the sentences of Thai prisoners, said Mr Suwit. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday also held talks with Gen Than 
Shwe, 
chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and 
SLORC secretary Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt.
