silence: Latest atrocities by the military junta have failed to spur
neighbouring countries into action

THE INVISIBLE, inaudible 'Asian way' of dealing with human rights abuses in
Burma is being severely tested by the latest flood of refugees into
neighbouring countries, following a series of army offensives and reported
atrocities against ethnic minorities by the Burmese military junta.
Worst affected have been the Moslems of Arakan in western Burma. In the past
two months about 100,000 of them have fled into Bangladesh with tales of
forced labour, torture, rape and killings at the hands of Burmese soldiers.
And the exodus is continuing.
Yesterday the United Nations World Food Programme said it was granting
Dollars 1.9m in emergency supplies to help Bangladesh cope with the influx
which it estimated at 1,200 refugees a day. Last week the UN High Commission
for Refugees allocated Dollars 1m in emergency funds for the refugees.
Bangladesh said yesterday that thousands of the migrants were on the verge
of starvation because relief efforts were inadequate. Speaking before the
latest UN announcement, one official described food and medical help
received so far as 'only a drop in the vast sea of needs'.
Other ethnic groups and guerrilla armies on Burma's frontiers have suffered,
too, as has the Buddhist majority in whose name the Burmese State Law and
Order Restoration Council (Slorc) claims to be fighting.
Most Asian governments have greeted the actions of the Slorc junta - which
is detaining Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and refuses to give
way to the government-in-waiting elected in 1990 - with a deafening silence.
Amid the growing international outcry over events in Burma, Mr Goh Chok
Tong, Singapore's prime minister, took pains to defend the regional policy
of 'constructive engagement' with Burma during the summit of the Association
of South East Asian Nations (Asean) at the end of last month.
Mr Goh urged his audience of journalists to understand the 'culture of
Asean', which, he explained, involved private discussions rather than
European-style public efforts to change the world. 'We do not interfere,' he
said. 'We just have our bilateral contacts.'
Human-rights activists complain that those contacts include selling arms to
Burma and stripping the country of natural resources such as gems, teak and
fish, while ignoring the plight of the Burmese.
Western companies have also been criticised for dealing with Burma,
esp-ecially in oil exploration, but western governments have roundly
condemned the Burmese authorities.
A loose alliance of Burmese opposition groups based in the beleaguered town
of Manerplaw on the Thai border is now hoping to persuade Asian governments
that they need to take a firm line against Burma in the interests of
regional security, however unmoved they may be by human rights abuses.
Bangladesh has appealed for international help in handling the refugees. At
least one Bangladeshi soldier has been killed by Burmese troops.
Thailand - another destination for refugees - has already seen
confrontations this year between its border patrols and the Burmese army.
The Thai press has criticised both the Burmese and Thai governments over
human rights in Burma, and Thai Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun said
bluntly last month: 'I don't like what's happening in Burma.'
A small number of refugees have also fled to Nagaland State in India, whose
government has been one of the few in Asia to take a strong moral stand
against the actions of the Burmese authorities.
Burma's opposition will nevertheless find it difficult to persuade Asia to
isolate the junta. China, Burma's principal arms supplier, appears to be
unimpressed by the pleas of the Burmese people.
Thailand is ambivalent. The foreign ministry is sensitive to western
criticism on the issue of Burma and the government as a whole is anxious to
keep the country's borders secure, but the military is notorious for its
profitable part in stripping Burma of its teak trees.
Burmese rebel groups, however, believe that the Thais are reluctant to allow
the Burmese army to overrun Manerplaw, which is controlled by the Karen
National Union with the assistance of monks, students and politicians from
Rangoon.
Opponents of the junta want the UN to take a much stronger line on Burma (so
far there has been only a mild resolution passed by consensus in the General
Assembly), even if they recognise that the UN is unlikely to recognise the
Manerplaw-based elected government.
They also want economic sanctions imposed on Burma, and in this area they
believe that western countries are no less guilty than Burma's silent Asian
neighbours and Japan.
'Without economic sanctions, the Slorc can get cash to buy arms,' says Mr
Hla Phay, spokesman in Bangkok for the National League for Democracy, the
party which won the Burmese elections but which was excluded from power.
Asian and western governments, however, doubt the effectiveness of
sanctions. As Mr Anand said: 'Burma is not now ready to listen to anybody.'
