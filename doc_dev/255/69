   More than 500 Burmese fled to Thailand today
and claimed they escaped from Burmese soldiers who raided their
village, kidnapped men and boys, and forced them to act as their
porters.
   The male refugees, ages 15 to 40, were hiding in the jungle in
this border area after fleeing their homes in Myawaddy village in
Burma.
   The refugees said government troops surrounded their village
Friday and led off males to haul artillery and mortar shells for
troops fighting ethnic minority rebels along the border. Thai
authorities confirmed their report.
   The Burmese are launching a major offensive against the ethnic
Karen, who field the strongest force among a dozen ethnic minority
rebel groups seeking greater autonomy from the central government in
Rangoon.
   That government has been sharply criticized in the past by human
rights groups, including the London-based Amnesty International, for
forcing villagers and Rangoon residents to do forced labor under
allegedly inhuman conditions.
   Burmese interviewed by The Associated Press last year said they
escaped from troops who had forcibly taken them from Rangoon to
carry heavy loads of equipment without pay. They said they were
given very little food and water.
   Maung Tun, a 40-year-old Burmese merchant among the latest
refugees, said the Burmese troops had seized 200 men in the village
Wednesday for forced labor. He said some villagers decided to flee
to other places inside Burma and to Thailand when the troops
returned to take more people Friday.
   Maung Hla, 28, quoted a Burmese soldier as saying troops were
also recruiting villagers to build a road to Kler Day, a former camp
of ethnic Karen insurgents. Burmese troops seized the camp on Jan.
14.
