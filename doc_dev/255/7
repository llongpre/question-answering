   The Interior Ministry has threatened to
expel U.N. or other refugee officials who assist Burmese dissidents
living in Thailand, newspapers reported today.
   Thailand has close ties with the military government that took
power in Burma two years ago by brutally crushing a student-led
movement for democracy. Thousands fled the suppression and joined
armed rebel groups in areas bordering Thailand and India.
   The Bangkok government began reconsidering the status of Burmese
asylum seekers after two Burmese students hijacked a Thai airliner
flying to their homeland on Nov. 10. Two other Burmese students
hijacked an jetliner to Thailand a year ago.
   The Nation newspaper said Chamnarn Potjana, deputy permanent
secretary of the Interior Ministry, on Friday warned international
organizations and aid agencies to stop assisting Burmese students.
   If they did not, ``no matter whether they are officials of the
UNHCR (U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees) or other United Nations
agencies, we will ask the Foreign Ministry to expel them from the
country as persona non grata,'' Chamnarn was quoted as saying.
   A Western relief official said on condition of anonymity that
the situation of Burmese students in Thailand had become very
serious. He said the High Commissioner was reviewing its assistance
to the students.
   ``We have responsibility for these people (students) and we have
to fulfill our obligations. At the same time we must take into
account the Thai position,'' he said.
   Thaung Htun, a spokesman for the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front, said the Thai government ``should consider the problem of
Burmese students from a humanitarian point of view. Any person who
fled should have the rights of a refugee.''
   Chamnarn spoke after a Cabinet committee meeting to discuss what
measures to take regarding the students. He said the committee had
recommended the establishment of a holding camp for Burmese
dissidents on the Thai-Burma border.
   The Nation quoted Chamnarn as saying the High Commissioner
should use the $120,000 monthly allowance it had for Burmese
students to establish the camp.
   The private U.S. Committee for Refugees estimates there are
2,000 Burmese students living in Bangkok. Another 2,700 are on the
Thai-Burma border, according to the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front, the main group of exiled students.
   Thailand considers the students illegal immigrants subject to
detention, fines and deportation. They depend on the aid of private
relief groups and grants from the U.N. High Commissioner ranging
from $40 to $120 a month.
   According to the U.S. Committee for Refugees, Thailand has
repatriated more than 5,200 Burmese, many of them students, since
1988. Amnesty International has cited reports that Burmese
authorities have brutally interrogated and tortured some students
repatriated from Thailand.
   The Bangkok Post quoted Chamnarn as saying that in addition to
the hijacking, Burmese students were thought responsible for a
recent small bomb attack on the Burmese Embassy compound in
Bangkok. He said Thailand would deport those who violated its
immigration law and penal code.
