   Burma's leader, Gen. Saw Maung, urged the
military Monday to continue its struggle against the country's
dozen rebel groups.
   On Sunday, government troops overran the main Karen camp of Maw
Po Kay, in Karen State, located on the border with Thailand. The
victory came after three days of intense fighting, according to
Burma's state radio.
   The broadcast said 38 government troops were killed and 189
soldiers wounded; at least 74 rebels were killed.
   ``The traitors such as the Burma Communist Party rebels ... and
the Karen National Union ... who are lackeys of foreign powers,
continue their efforts ... to cause the disintegration of the
state,'' Saw Maung said at a military parade marking Armed Forces
Day.
   Saw Maung seized power in a bloody coup in September when his
troops killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide movement for
democracy.
   On Monday, he repeated pledges the military will hand over power
to the winner of a general election next year.
   ``With the improvement of the general situation, free and fair
general elections will be held throughout the country, except in
the areas where there is no peace and tranquility because of rebel
activities,'' he said.
   Burma has been torn by ethnic clashes since gaining independence
from Britain four decades ago.
   The Karens, with about 4,000 fighters, roam vast tracts of the
southeastern border with Thailand.
   Sunday's loss of Maw Po Kay, 80 miles northwest of Raheng,
Thailand, was considered a major defeat, sources said. The Karens
had held the camp for several years despite previous government
offensives.
   Government troops seized rebel weapons and ammunition in the
attack, the broadcast said.
   The fighting forced the evacuation of 3,000 people from the Tha
Song Yang district of Thailand's Tak province, located near the
camp. Government troops captured two other Karen camps along the
Thai-Burmese border in December and January.
   The Karens are one of a dozen minority groups that have sought
greater autonomy promised to them in Burma's constitution after
independence was won from Britain in 1948.
   The minorities live in Burma's rugged frontier and make up about
30 percent of Burma's 38 million people. Most Burmese live in the
central part of the country.
   The lifestyles and traditions of the minorities differ from
those of the dominant Burmese, who are mainly Buddhist.
