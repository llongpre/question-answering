   About 1,000 guerrillas trying to seize a
government post fought fierce battles with soldiers along the river
border with Thailand today, a government spokesman said.
   The Karen guerrillas raided perimeter outposts on Sept. 26, then
sent reinforcements to attack government troops at Methawaw, on the
western bank of the Moei River, said the spokesman, Kyaw Sann.
   More than 150 rounds from mortars and recoiless rifles, fired
from the Thai side of the river, crashed into Methawaw on Sunday,
he told reporters. Shells fired by the guerrillas inside Burma also
struck Thai territory, he said.
   The area is about 130 miles northeast of Rangoon.
   The fighting occurred less than a month after military commander
Gen. Saw Maung seized power from a civilian government and brutally
suppressed widespread anti-government protests led by students and
Buddhist months.
   Kyaw Sann, who gave no casualty figures, said the fighting
continued today ``in the second biggest engagement'' since Sept. 30
when government forces drove back 2,000 guerrillas of the Burma
Communist Party from Mong Yang in the east. The guerrillas had
attacked the government outpost Sept. 23.
   The government had said more than 200 communist guerrillas and
47 soldiers, including five officers, were killed in that fighting.
   ``In the northeast, near Mongko and Kyukok areas, we noticed the
Burma Communist Party massing troops recently,'' Kyaw Sann said.
``We are also preparing for any assault from them.''
   The Karens, an ethnic-based group, and the communists are the
country's two most powerful insurgencies. They have been fighting
the government for decades, the Karens seeking greater autonomy for
their areas.
   Kyaw Sann also acknowledged that more than 3,000 students had
joined the rebel groups since Saw Maung seized power in Rangoon
Sept. 18. He said some of the students were receiving military
training.
   Officials of three rebel groups told reporters in Thailand on
Sunday that 4,000 students and other civilians had joined their
ranks.
   Students were at the forefront of pro-democracy demonstrations
in Rangoon, but they were driven underground by Saw Maung's troops,
who have killed at least 440 people since the takeover.
   Kyaw Sann said 2,000 of the students had joined the Karens and
500 joined the communists while the rest joined five other rebel
groups.
   The Karens are among a dozen major ethnic minority groups in
Burma, a country of 38 million people. the Karens, who live largely
along the Thai-Burmese border and in the Irrawaddy Delta, number 2
million. During the colonial period large numbers were converted to
Christianity by american and other missionaries and enjoyed
relative freedom under the British rule.
   Feeling that the promise of autonomy within a federal system
after independence had been broken, a number of Karens fled to
jungle areas along the Thai-Burmese border and in 1949 rose up in
rebellion, managing to fight their way to the gates of Rangoon
before being pushed back to their sanctuaries.
   Karen leader Gen. Bo Mya said recently that his insurgent group,
called the Karen National Union, fields 17,000 troops.
