  [Text] The companies planning to build a pipeline to 
transport natural gas from an offshore field in Burma to 
Thailand have for the first time revealed the route the pipeline 
will take. 
  Human rights and environmental groups fear that its 
construction will lead to extensive deforestation and the 
displacement of villagers and refugees in order to secure the 
route. 
  Several refugee camps in the area have already been burnt 
down and their inhabitants ordered out, although no explanation 
was given by the Thai authorities. 
  North of the route, Mon rebel leaders are coming under 
increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the Burmese 
government. Mon troops are at present skirmishing with Burmese 
soldiers. 
  Assuming that the national oil companies of Burma and 
Thailand -- the Myanmar [Burma] Oil &amp; Gas Enterprise (MOGE) 
and 
the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) -- can come to an 
agreement on the price Thailand will pay for the gas, the 
pipeline will come ashore between the towns of Ye and Tavoy in 
Burma and follow the Tavoy and Zinba river valleys up toward the 
border of Thailand. 
  It will then cross highlands of dense virgin forest to enter 
Thailand at Ban I-Tong (Nai Et Taung in Burma) in Kanchanaburi 
Province. 
  From Ban I-Tong, the pipeline will follow a road down to 
Thong Pha Phum and then head south to a new power plant to be 
built in Ratchaburi. 
  Total, a French state-owned oil company which has signed a 
production-sharing agreement with the Burmese government for the 
offshore field in the Gulf of Martaban, will be responsible for 
constructing the pipeline in Burma while PTT will build it on 
the Thai side. 
  The pipeline's chosen course was revealed in a letter dated 
Jan 12 from Joseph Daniel, Total's director of communications, 
to Yvette Pierpaoli, a French refugee worker. A copy of the 
letter has been obtained by THE NATION. 
  The letter claims that by following the river valleys in 
Burma -- where there are only "scattered shrubs" -- and the 
existing road in Thailand, the pipeline's environmental impact 
would be minimized. "Only the very last (two to three) 
kilometres in Burma... will require cutting some trees," it says. 
  "No population displacement is required on the Total 
pipeline 
course which follows a region which as far as we have seen is 
perfectly quiet," it adds. The letter claims that surveys along 
the course have been carried out by foot, car and helicopter 
since last April. 
  The route was confirmed by a PTT source who wished to remain 
anonymous. The source said a decision on the route was made 
several months ago. Talks between Burma, Thailand and Total 
were being held yesterday in Bangkok over the price of the gas. 
  The route is significant in that it helps to explain recent 
events at the border. On April 7, last year, the 9th Division 
of the Royal Thai Army reportedly burned down two villages -- 
Aung Tha Pye and Democracy Village -- just south of Ban I-Tong, 
displacing 500 people in all, most of them ethnic Tavoyar 
refugees. 
  At the time, the PTT denied knowing about the evictions and 
claimed the pipeline would follow the old "Death Railway" route 
from Amherst in Burma through Three Pagoda Pass, well north of 
Ban I- Tong. 
  More recently, Mon and Karen groups have come under 
increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council (Slorc) which rules Burma. Both Mon 
and Karen soldiers are active in the area where the pipeline 
will be laid. 
  Sources claim that Burmese troops from Kaleinaung approached 
the border on Feb 20 near Sangkhla Buri, roughly 30 kms north of 
Ban I- Tong and 10 kms south of Three Pagoda Pass. Over the 
last few weeks, the Mon National Liberation Army, which has its 
headquarters in the area, has reportedly fought intermittent 
battles with Slorc soldiers, who gained control of Three Pagoda 
Pass and Nai Et Taung several years ago. 
  At the same time, the 7,000 Mon refugees in the Loh Loe 
refugee camp near Sangkhla Buri have been ordered by Thai 
military authorities to move to Hlakhani -- located on the 
border around five kms from the Slorc military camp at Three 
Pagoda Pass -- by the end of this month. 
  Phisan Phalatsing, a leader of the Mon community in 
Thailand, 
fears that this will leave the refugees extremely vulnerable to 
attacks by Slorc. 
  "It's quite clear that the Mon are being pressured to agree 
to a ceasefire so that the pipeline can be built," he said at a 
protest held two weeks ago in front of the UN building in 
Bangkok. 
  A leaflet handed out by the Thai-Mon protesters stated that 
"Onshore and off-shore natural resources -- such as timber, 
fish, oil and gas -- left over by Mon forefathers in posterity 
are being sold at a pittance by the Slorc to benefit a small 
military clique. Mons, who are the real owners, have no voice 
whatsoever in the disposal of this inheritance." 
  Meanwhile, within Burma, 20,000-30,000 villagers have been 
conscripted to build a railroad from Ye to Tavoy and to upgrade 
the road which runs between the two coastal towns. The railroad 
is considered important for Burma's national development but 
will also make it easier for Slorc troops to secure the area 
where the pipeline will be laid. 
  Conditions at the worksites are reported to be appalling and 
have led many villagers to escape to Thailand, adding to numbers 
in refugee camps. 
  The PTT source contacted yesterday said Thailand had 
preferred a more southerly route for the pipeline but Burmese 
authorities consider the chosen route to be the best in terms of 
security. He admitted to being ignorant, however, of the 
measures being taken to secure the route. 
  "If the pipeline's impact is too harmful, the project will 
have to be dropped," he said. But he expressed hope that the 
money paid by Thailand for the gas would be spread among the 
Burmese people and used to develop the country. 
  "Funding of the pipeline will have to come from outside 
sources, so the Myanmar government will be under pressure to 
develop the pipeline in a proper way," he said. Talks over 
financing have yet to take place, he added.
