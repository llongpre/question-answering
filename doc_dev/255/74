   Burmese troops attacked rebel bases
near the Thai border, and 40 people were killed and 70 wounded,
Thai military sources said Monday.
   Thai authorities evacuated 100 villagers after 2,500 soldiers
attacked Karen strongholds at Wan Kha and Ban Wang Takian on Sunday.
   Several artillery shells were reported to have fallen inside
Thai territory and Burmese troops crossed into Thailand during the
assault, the military source said on condition of anonymity.
   About 30 Burmese soldiers and 10 guerrillas were killed, he said.
   Also Sunday, 3,000 Burmese civilians fled into Thailand at Sai
Luad to escape fighting at a third border location, Myawaddy.
   Karen rebels are among a dozen ethnic minority groups fighting
for greater autonomy from the Rangoon government. The government in
recent months has intensified its campaign against the Karens and
has severely disrupted the cross border trade that sustains their
insurgency.
   The Karen strongholds are located along Thailand's western
border with Burma.
