   The diehard Karen rebels have been
squeezed into shrinking frontier enclaves and may be down to the
last battles of their 41-year-old fight for autonomy.
   It has been a long, hard march for one of Burma's many ethnic
minorities, most of it backward. At the beginning, in the late
1940s, Karen troops swept through Burma's major cities and even
penetrated to the outskirts of Rangoon, the capital.
   In the past two years, the army has overrun most of the Karen
bases along the Thai border and sent 28,000 refugees fleeing across
the frontier.
   Thailand, eager to exploit Burma's rich forests, has struck
deals with the government at the expense of the rebels. Hundreds of
fighters have died on both sides in fierce jungle combat, sometimes
hand-to-hand.
   The opposition won the Burmese national elections last weekend,
but it is not certain how that will affect the Karen war or when
the military government will relinquish power.
   Among the last Karen strongholds is the border town of
Manerplaw, capital of territory the Karen call Kawtoolei.
   Manerplaw, probably one of the world's most idyllic guerrilla
bases, sits on the Moei River, at the foot of mist-streaked hills.
   Its neat wood-and-thatch buildings house 12 government
departments of the Karen National Union, including foreign affairs,
fisheries and mining. Karen leaders claim to command 10,000 troops
and govern 1 million civilians.
   The Karen fighters and a dozen other rebellious ethnic
minorities with which they are allied do not seek independence, but
greater political and cultural autonomy.
   ``If you consider it historically, it is the worst situation we
have faced, but it doesn't mean the end of the Karen revolution,''
said Ba Thein, general secretary of the Karen National Union.
   He said the Karen were switching to more classic-style guerrilla
warfare and would have little trouble operating in areas of eastern
Burma dominated by the Karen minority. A ``mobile headquarters''
would be organized if Manerplaw fell to the Burmese, he said in an
interview.
   Ba Thein also expressed hope for internal political change in
Burma.
   ``We are not alone,'' he said. ``All the people in Burma are
struggling for freedom. We believe that, if democracy comes, all
the ethnic minority problems with be solved.''
   Burma's military, which brutally crushed a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988, has shown remarkable tenacity.
   The loss of border bases has greatly reduced the Karen National
Union's income from taxes levied on frontier smuggling, which was
used to buy weapons.
   In contrast, the 200,000-member Burmese military has restocked
its arsenal with funds from teak-logging concessions granted to
Thai businessmen.
   Burmese control of the border is now in the interest of powerful
Thais, and rebel officers say some Thai-Burmese military
cooperation has occurred.
   ``The logging has been the death knell of the Karen,'' said a
knowledgeable Western observer in Bangkok. He noted that earlier
friendly and mutually advantageous ties between the Thais and Karen
had helped sustain the insurgency.
   What some sympathetic Westerners and Thais have called the
``sellout of the Karen'' fits a historical pattern.
   Although the Karen have lived in what is now Burma at least as
long as the Burmans, they have been suppressed and looked down upon
as ``savages'' and ``wild cattle of the hills.''
   The Karen fought bravely alongside the Allies in World War II,
while a pro-Japanese government sat in Rangoon, but promises of
some autonomy were broken when Burma gained independence from
Britain in 1947.
   After the early successes of their insurgency, the tide turned
against the Karen rebels and they were gradually forced into the
border region.
   There has been incompetence and some corruption among the aging
rebel leaders, who have not conducted a real guerrilla war, and
disparities in power and education between the Christian leaders
and their followers, most of whom are Buddhist or animist.
   In 1984, the government stepped up its campaign and three years
later announced it would destroy the Karen National Union within
two years. That has not happened, but two words often heard when
the rebels discuss the future are ``dark'' and ``bleak.''
   ``I am 63 and have fought all my life,'' Ba Thein said. ``My
children have now joined the revolution. Perhaps the next
generation will also have to struggle.''
