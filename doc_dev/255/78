   Two Burmese rebel groups battling over
the right to tax smugglers left hundreds killed or wounded in 11
days of fierce fighting near the Thai border, officials said today.
   Two senior Thai provincial officials said the fighting began on
July 23, when hundreds of Karen rebels pounded the Mon rebels at
Ban Chedi, or Pagoda Village, with mortars and rocket-propelled
grenades. They said many civilians were killed or wounded in the
three-hour assault.
   The officials said fighting died down today with both sides
short of ammunition and food, but that about 500 Karen guerrillas
still were besieging about 300 Mon rebels.
   The village is in southeastern Mon State and opposite the Thai
village of Three Pagoda Pass in Kanchanaburi province, about 175
miles northwest of Bangkok.
   The officials, quoting military intelligence reports, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Karen and the Mon are two of about a dozen ethnic minority
groups who have been fighting the Burmese government for four
decades for greater autonomy. Both maintain their strongholds along
Burma's eastern border with Thailand, and both generally have
cooperated with each other, using the same smuggling routes.
   But the fighting erupted after Karen rebels said armed Mon
guerrillas demanded ``protection money'' from Karen civilians who
passed through Mon-controlled areas to engage in illegal trade with
Thai villagers.
   The Mons said the Karens extorted similar taxes from Mon
civilians passing through Karen-controlled areas, the Thai
officials said.
   The officials said fire broke out in the village market during
the July 23 attack, and smoke could be seen from the Thai side of
the border.
   The Karens then got reinforcements from other rebel groups to
try to capture the village, but the Mons fought back, they said.
   The most recent big clash was on Sunday, when the Karens again
attacked with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, setting the
village market ablaze. The attack lasted 30 minutes, the Thai
officials said.
   Thai intelligence officers who crossed the border after Sunday's
fighting and walked near the besieged village said they smelled the
stench of rotting corpses.
   The provincial officials said one Thai soldier was killed and
another soldier wounded by mortar fire that strayed into Thailand
during the fighting.
   Thai officials said border patrol policemen and soldiers were
dispatched to the frontier to push back hundreds of Burmese
civilians who tried to cross into Thailand to escape the fighting.
About 300 Thais living in the border area have been moved further
away, they said.
   The Mons and the Karens have been fighting Burma since it gained
its independence from Britain in 1948. They contend the government
has reneged on pledges to grant autonomy to ethnic groups.
   Among Burma's 38 million people, there are about 3 million
Karens and 1.3 million Mons. Both are predominately Buddhist,
although the Karen elite is mainly Christian.
