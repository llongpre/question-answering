   Eighty students who fled to remote rebel
camps following brutal suppression of a pro-democracy uprising
returned home Monday from Thailand aboard two Burmese air force
planes.
   About 7,000 students and others remained along the Thai-Burmese
border, where many have vowed to fight the Rangoon government
alongside ethnic minority rebels.
   The 80 students were repatriated after Burma asked the Thai
government for help in getting them back. They fled Rangoon and
other areas of the country following the Sept. 18 military coup by
Gen. Saw Maung.
   ``We don't know how to express our happiness to be back in Burma
after nearly three months of ordeal,'' said Saw Hla, a student from
Rangoon. The students along the border have been suffering from
malaria, poor nutrition and other hardships of jungle life.
   In a repatriation plan worked out during a visit Dec. 14 to Burma
by Thai army commander Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh, Saw Maung's
government reportedly pledged that returning students won't be
harmed. It also said Thai and Red Cross officials would be allowed
in to monitor the status of the returnees.
   The Rangoon government has given Dec. 31 as the deadline for
repatriation of the students but indicated it might give an
extension. The Thai government set up a transit camp at Tak, near
the Burmese border, where those intending to return are being housed.
   The majority of students who have sought refuge with the
insurgents have thus far spurned the repatriation offer. On
Saturday, they seized two Thai district officials who had gone to
persuade the students to return home, government sources in Thailand
said.
   The students arrived in Burma on Burmese air force planes which
were accompanied by two Thai aircraft carrying Thai journalists.
   Thirteen of the returning students were from Rangoon and were
reunited with their parents at a military camp. The others will be
sent to their home areas, government spokesman Kyaw Sann said.
   Sai Thiha, a headmaster at a primary school in eastern Burma,
said 36 students still remained behind at Tak, uncertain whether to
return. But Thai officials described the 36 as deserters from the
Burmese military and not students.
   There have been a number of unconfirmed reports that students who
had earlier returned on their own had disappeared and were presumed
killed by the authorities.
   Burma has been shunned by most of the world community since the
uprising, during which the military gunned down largely unarmed
demonstrators by the hundreds.
