  [Text] The Thai-Burmese regional border committee started 
its ninth meeting in Bangkok yesterday with highlights of 
discussions on illegal Burmese immigrants, disputed border areas 
and fisheries problems. 
  First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chetha Thanajaro said 
representatives from both sides would first hold unofficial 
talks to accelerate the negotiation process, and that the 
meeting itself will discuss the agreed topics and details. 
  He said bilateral problems abound since the two countries 
share an over 2,000-km-long border, but that previous meetings 
had gradually helped resolve several thorny issues. 
  Many problems cannot be settled in one go, and both sides 
have to hold several more rounds of negotiations to finalize 
their agreement, he added. 
  "For example, on the question of illegal (Burmese) 
immigrants, they (Burmese officials) have pledged to tighten up 
their control, and thus the number has dr@pped from over 300,000 
to about 200,000," he said. 
  Bangkok will be the venue of the first three-day meeting, 
while both sides will meet on the fourth in Pattaya. The 
Burmese team, headed by Southern Commander Maj Gen Khet Sein, 
will on Friday pay a visit to the petrochemical industries in 
Lam Chabang Eastern Seaboard.
