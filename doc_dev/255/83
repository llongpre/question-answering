   The Burmese warlord indicted by the
United States on 10 drug trafficking charges acknowledges he
annually ships hundreds of tons of heroin to the West.
   After more than two decades in the dangerous business, Khun Sa
has an unquestioned gift for survival, and even the U.S. officials
who announced the indictments Thursday said there was little chance
he would be apprehended.
   The world's No. 1 heroin producer maintains his business in
Southeast Asia's jungles despite repeated Thai and Burmese military
strikes, clashes with rival drug armies, and rumors of fatal
illness. Estimates of the size of his private army run from 4,000
to 16,000 fighters.
   He once told a journalist that the secret of his health was
tending his garden patch, growing cabbages and carrots.
   Burma's military government said today that it would cooperate
in the international war on drugs, but Western narcotics experts in
Thailand charge that some senior Burmese officials are actively
involved in trafficking.
   Little reliable information is available on Khun Sa, who is said
to have been born in 1933 to an ethnic Chinese father and a mother
of Burma's Shan ethnic minority.
   Certainly he has been extensively involved since the 1960s in
the narcotics trade in the Golden Triangle, where the borders of
Thailand, Laos and Burma converge to form a rugged and lawless
no-man's land.
   He invited reporters to his lair in early 1987, and threatened
then to increase opium production in Shan State areas under his
control from 600 to 900 tons that year. It was suggested at the
time he was angered by a just-launched Burmese program of aerial
spraying of poppy fields with aid from the U.S. government.
   Khun Sa admitted to the reporters that there were many mobile
heroin refineries in his areas, the Bangkok Post newspaper said. It
quoted him as saying he made about $7.6 million in 1986, including
revenue from taxing traders transiting his territory to smuggle
gems, cattle and narcotics.
   But Khun Sa has largely played down the narcotics connection and
instead insisted he was fighting for greater autonomy for the
Shans, just as a dozen other insurgent groups were fighting for the
rights of other Burmese minority groups.
   ``I am a nationalist, not a trafficker,'' he told a reporter who
visited him in 1986.
   Partly because he masqueraded as a freedom fighter and partly by
links with corrupt Thai officials, Khun Sa built up his operations
and his Shan United Army at Ban Hin Taek, in the hills of Chiang
Mai province in northern Thailand bordering Burma.
   Thai forces launched a major strike that killed large numbers of
his soldiers and drove him into the jungles of Shan State in
January 1982. But he rebuilt the army in a short time and extended
his influence into new areas of the frontier.
   The Burmese government said that its troops, backed by air
strikes and artillery, overran his Shan State headquarters in May
1984.
   But by all accounts, the opium warlord remains active and news
reports have said he has set up refineries in Laos in more recent
years.
   The U.S. charges stem from the largest heroin seizure in history
_ about 2,300 pounds seized in February 1988 in Bangkok before they
were to be shipped to New York.
   Analysts said there now is little hope of ferreting him out
since the Rangoon government has little authority in Shan State.
   Western officials have charged Rangoon authorities with
profiting from the drug trade. Rangoon's commitment to fighting
drugs became more suspect after the military seized power in
September 1988, killing hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators.
The United States responded by ending aid, including the joint drug
suppression effort.
