   Burmese government troops shelled
and seized an important base of Karen insurgents Tuesday, killing
10 students who were defending the camp and wounding 12, sources
said.
   Sporadic shooting continued into the early afternoon, said a
Thai police officer, Col. Amphol Ngamchit.
   The camp, the third important rebel base seized in five months,
is in Burma's southeastern Karen State, near the border with
Thailand.
   The students killed in the attack joined the rebels after
September's military coup in Burma and subsequent crackdown on
student-led dissent. Amphol said other students and rebels at the
camp fled to a region 19 miles to the southeast.
   Col. Thepho Trichana, superintendant of the Thai border patrol
police in the area, said some shells strayed into Thai territory
from Tuesday's fighting, destroying three houses and a school
cafeteria. The area had been evacuated and no one was injured, he
said.
   Government forces began the offensive against Htee Ger Nee two
weeks ago, Amphol said.
   Last month, troops seized the longtime Karen stronghold of Maw
Poh Kay. They seized two other bases near the Thai border in
January and December.
   Burmese troops have been fighting the Karen National Union and a
dozen other minority groups since shortly after the country
achieved independence from Great Britain four decades ago. The
Karens, an ethnic minority, accuse the government of reneging on
promises of greater regional autonomy made at that time.
   Minorities make up about 30 percent of Burma's 38 million
people, who are predominantly Buddhist.
