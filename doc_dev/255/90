   Two Burmese students who hijacked a
jetliner in an effort to gain democracy for their military-ruled
homeland surrendered today, and a Thai official indicated they
would be treated leniently.
   The students seized control of the Fokker 28 during a domestic
flight in Burma Friday and ordered it flown to Bangkok. They then
threatened to blow up the craft and the 83 others aboard if their
demands for democracy were not met.
   But after 10 hours of negotiations with Thai and Burmese
officials, the hostages were freed unharmed and the students gave
themselves up.
   ``I think really now it is a matter of looking at the details of
the negotiations and the conditions for the surrender,'' said a
senior Thai official, on condition of anonymity.
   Another Thai official indicated the students would probably be
treated leniently.
   ``We think they are students and not professional terrorists,''
he said on condition of anonymity.
   Although Thailand has nurtured friendly relations with Burma, it
does not have a formal extradition treaty with that country. The
Thai official said it was possible the students would be sent to a
third country.
   Thirty-five hostages were released late Friday and the remaining
48 passengers and crew were allowed to leave early today. Aung Gyi,
a Burmese embassy official, said the passengers would be sent back
to Burma today.
   A Thai official later entered the empty plane and emerged
carrying a box he said contained a bomb.
   The hijackers had demanded the release of political prisoners,
an end to military rule and the restoration of democracy in Burma.
   But Thailand's Deputy Government Spokesman Likit Hongladarom,
said the hijackers _ identified as Ye Yin and Ye Thi Ha _ simply
wanted their demands known and published by the press. They had
probably not expected the Rangoon government would act on them, he
said.
   Slogans were scribbled with a felt pen on the inside and outside
of the aircraft, recalling last year's military crackdown on the
student-led uprising in Burma.
   ``Democracy and human rights for our people'' and ``Our heads
are bloody but unbowed,'' the slogans read.
   The names of the hijackers, which translate as ``brave'' and
``lion'' respectively, appeared to be pseudonyms.
   A statement they gave to a reporter was signed Ye Thon Baw,
which literally means the ``Three brave comrades.'' It was not,
however, clear who the third person was.
   The official Burmese news agency said the plane was hijacked
between Mergui in southern Burma and Rangoon, the capital, then
diverted at gunpoint to Thailand. The Fokker landed in Utaphao, a
sprawling military base southeast of Bangkok used by U.S. B-52
bombers during the Vietnam War.
   The hijackers then handed Thai authorities a list of seven
demands, which included the release of top opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi, an end to the military-imposed curfew and restoration
of democracy in Burma.
   Ms. Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest on July 20 after
speaking out against the military government. Her National League
for Democracy is Burma's largest opposition party in Burma.
   Thousands of students fled the 1988 uprising and another
clampdown on opposition this year. Many took refuge with ethnic
rebel groups that have fought the Rangoon government for 40 years
for greater autonomy.
   Thaung Htun, a spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic
Front, said his group had no part in the hijacking, but said, ``We
have sympathy and understanding with their actions.''
