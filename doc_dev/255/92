   A U.S. writer for Soldier of Fortune
magazine who once fought with Afghan guerrillas died Wednesday of
gunshot and shrapnel wounds suffered during fighting between
Burmese troops and border rebels.
   Lance Eugene Motley, a 32-year-old West Point graduate from
Sacramento, Calif., was brought to Mae Sot hospital Tuesday night,
medical staff said.
   Police said Motley apparently crossed into Burma three days
earlier with ethnic Karen rebels and went to their camp at Kaw Moo
Ra, which has been besieged by Burmese troops since May 18.
   Fighting has been intense in the jungles of this border region
since Burmese troops launched an offensive last October against the
rebels, who are fighting for autonomy from the central government.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Neil Klopfenstein confirmed the death
Wednesday of an American citizen ``after an incident on the
Thai-Burma border,'' but refused to give details.
   The monthly Soldier of Fortune magazine, which specializes in
combat and weaponry, said in a statement that Motley was in
Thailand to cover wars in Burma, Laos and Cambodia.
   It said he previously worked for the magazine in Guatamala, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, Colombia, the Philippines and
Pakistan.
   In 1985, Motley traveled across Afghanistan's Hazarajat region
and reached Herat, Afghanistan's second largest city, the statement
said, adding that the Afghans nicknamed him the ``Bearded Mystic.''
   It said Motley ``fought with the mujahedeen (Islamic holy
warriors) against the communist puppet soldiers and Soviets for
some months until wounded.''
   The publication said he was traveling with the Karens when hit,
but did not say if he intended to fight with them.
