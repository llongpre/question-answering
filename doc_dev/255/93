  [Text] Burmese authorities agreed yesterday to free 30 
Thais from Rangoon's notorious In Sein prison, following two 
days of top level border discussions, First Army Region Lt Gen 
[Lieutenant General] Chettha Thanacharo said yesterday. 
  The prisoners, whose sentences ranged from 10 to 15 years, 
are to be released unconditionally and immediately, he told 
reporters. 
  There are some 350 Thais in In Sein, most of them fishermen 
and loggers caught in Burmese territory, according to the Thai 
Ambassador to Rangoon, Wirasak Futrakun. 
  Chettha was close-mouthed on progress on other issues during 
the Thailand-Burma Regional Border Committee meeting, which 
finished in Bangkok yesterday. 
  But he said Burmese officials showed a "good attitude 
towards 
solving border disputes through official channels and that 
prisoners of both countries would be treated humanely." 
  Chettha added that Major General Khet Sein, who is heading 
the Burmese delegation to Bangkok, also agreed to look into the 
case of nine Thai fishing trawlers which went missing recently 
in the Andaman Sea and showed up later in Rangoon.
