   Thirty-six students who fled Burma's
military crackdown flew home today, and authorities allowed a
one-month extension for thousands of others to return from the Thai
border region.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann told reporters the government had
extended its deadline from Saturday to Jan. 31 for the students to
return.
   A Burmese air force plane brought back the second group of
students since the government announced all students who fled after
the Sept. 18 military coup and had sought haven could return without
retribution.
   A group of 80 students arrived in Rangoon on Monday from a
special transition camp in the northern Thai city of Tak, near
guerrilla-held border areas.
   Among the second group was Aung Mo Myint, 20. His elder brother
had returned on Monday, and at that time their father made an
emotional plea for the return of his other son.
   Aung Mo Myint wept when he asked a reporter about his father, and
was told of the plea.
   He said he did not accompany his brother earlier because, ``I was
skeptical about the government's intention. I am now convinced that
it is genuine, and we are safe to be back in our country. I am sure
others will also return. We heard on the radio about the receptions
here.''
   Another student, Hkun Thaung Myine, said he felt sorry for his
colleagues left behind, some of whom he said ``may have difficulties
in escaping from the rebels.''
   Thai officials said 19 other students remained in the camp in
Tak, including some whose departures were delayed because they were
waiting for friends and relatives still staying with Burmese
insurgents along the border. They estimate 7,000 students remain
along the border.
   University students led massive nationwide demonstrations for
democracy in Burma until the new military authorities crushed the
protests.
   Many of the students found jungle life too harsh or said the
guerrillas mistreated them.
   The protests prompted the resignation in July of Ne Win, who
overthrew a civilian government in 1962 and led Burma's only
political party since then. In August, Maung Maung became Burma's
first civilian leader in 26 years, declared an end to a multiparty
state and promised elections.
   He was overthrown by army Gen. Saw Maung a month later. Saw Maung
also has promised elections but has not issued a date for elections.
   The agreement to repatriate the students was reached by Saw Maung
and Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the Thai army chief who on Dec. 14
became the first high foreign official to visit Burma since the coup.
