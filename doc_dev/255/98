Thailand has put air force units on alert and reinforced troops on the
border with Burma following incursions into Thai territory by Burmese
soldiers pursuing Karen guerrillas, Victor Mallet reports from Bangkok.
Border skirmishes have been particularly intense in the last few days as the
Burmese military tries to overrun Karen strongholds before the rainy season.
Thai officers have rejected demands from their Burmese counterparts to
withdraw from the area, and the military-installed government in Bangkok,
which enjoys good relations with Burma, has shown no public sign of concern.
Further north, the Burmese army's capture of Sleeping Dog Hill at the
weekend could lead to the capture of the nearby Karen headquarters at
Manerplaw.
