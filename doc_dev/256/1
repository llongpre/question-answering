   Pop singer Stevie Wonder's Academy
Award-winning song ``I Just Called To Say I Love You'' was written
by two other people and stolen by Wonder after it was played for
him, a lawyer charged.
   Songwriter Lloyd Chiate, 40, claims he and collaborator Lee
Garrett wrote the song in the 1970s and titled it ``I Just Called
To Say.'' Wonder says he wrote the song himself before the pair
composed their song.
   Wonder, who was born Steveland Morris, is being sued in federal
court for alleged copyright infringement by Chiate.
   ``We are going to prove to you that Mr. Morris took the song
written by Mr. Chiate and Mr. Garrett for his own benefit ... and
Mr. Chiate received nothing,'' attorney Herbert Dodell said
Wednesday in opening statements as Wonder sat in the courtroom.
   But Wonder's attorney, Howard King, said the pop star wrote the
song's chorus on July 16, 1976, as he returned from a visit with
his mother in the San Fernando Valley, before Chiate and Garret
ever met.
   He said Wonder completed the song in 1984 after hearing part of
the soundtrack to the film ``The Woman in Red.''
   King added that Garrett, who dropped out as a plaintiff in the
case, has acknowledged that Wonder actually wrote the song.
