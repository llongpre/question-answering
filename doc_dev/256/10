   Singer Eddy Raven is working on a streak
of four straight No. 1 country music records.
   But the biggest song with which he's been associated was one he
wrote that took nine years to become a hit and then became a
country classic: ``Thank God for Kids,'' recorded by the Oak Ridge
Boys.
   The 44-year-old Raven is at the peak of a 20-year recording
career. His ``'Till You Cry'' recently reached No. 1 on at least
one of the national country charts, joining his earlier top ranked
``Shine Shine Shine,'' ``I'm Gonna Get You'' and ``Joe Knows How to
Live.''
   Since October 1987, each of his singles has been No. 1. His
first No. 1 record was ``I Got Mexico'' in 1984. Several other
songs of his have been close to the top spot.
   But it was the emotional lyrics of ``Thank God for Kids'' that
probably will make it the most enduring song of his prolific
singing and songwriting career. The impassioned tune sold 1 million
copies for the Oak Ridge Boys in five weeks in 1982, and has become
the theme song for various anti-child abuse campaigns in the seven
years since.
   ``There's stone reality in that song,'' Raven said in an
interview. ``Everybody who's had kids has had KoolAid on the couch.
Every father has tried to fly a kite. And kids ask thousands of
questions.''
   He composed the song at home in 15 minutes in 1973, inspired by
his 3-year-old son, who said he wanted to help his father write
about Mickey Mouse and Big Bird.
   Raven himself recorded the song in 1976 but only as the B-side
of a record. Music industry executives told him the subject matter
just wasn't what country music fans wanted.
   ``I was told country folks don't care about Santa Claus and
Christmas, that they are interested in love and barrooms,'' Raven
said. ``I tried for three years to get that song put out. They said
no.''
   Finally, the song reached the hands of the Oak Ridge Boys who
made it a hit and one of their most requested tunes.
   As a singer, he recently released the album ``Best of Eddy
Raven,'' his top selling LP to date. Due out by summer on the new
Universal label is another album, ``Temporary Sanity.''
   ``We wanted the title to at least stir some excitement from
people: `What has he done now?''' Raven said about the intriguing
title.
   He has a deep, masculine voice that pours out incisive songs in
a style he describes as ``Cajun reggae, Caribbean Cajun, electric
Cajun.''
   ``No one is doing exactly what we're doing,'' he said about his
style.
   ``Someone asked me why I don't do more hard country like Randy
Travis and Ricky Van Shelton. I said, `Why? They do it great and I
can't do it any better than that.'
   ``I want to break some new ground and bring the Cajun heritage a
step farther and a little step up if we can.''
   Raven, a native of Lafayette, La., was the oldest of 10 children
born to a truck driver. He began performing and writing in his
early teens, but has worked in the cotton and rice fields, as a
service station attendant and in a lumberyard. He even ``ran
moonshine'' for a while.
   His first album came out in 1969, making this his 20th year as a
recording artist.
   He said his streak of No. 1 records has made him more aggressive.
   ``They make you fight harder to make a better product. If you
are honest and realize how fleeting they are and how fortunate you
are, it makes you work harder to find that better song and change
that one lyric to make it better.
   ``It also gives you a little more to show for what you've done.
You hang up a No. 1 plaque before you hang up a No. 3 plaque.''
   He attributed part of his recent success to being hard-headed:
``I've always been stubborn. When people made a suggestion, I
always asked why instead of saying OK. But I got a little more
adamant about it. I really analyzed everything a little better.
   ``I had more expertise. I worked a little bit more. I'm able to
draw on a lot more road experience and more of what the public is
listening to.''
