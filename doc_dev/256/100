   Aunt Marie helps them with their voice projection
and Uncle Donny wrote them a song, but the Osmond Boys say they're
working on their own image.
   ``We grew up around music but we're not trying to copy
anybody,'' leader Michael Osmond, 15, said Saturday before a
performance at the Michigan State Fair.
   The four brothers, Michael, Nathan, 13, Douglas, 12, and David,
11, are sons of Alan Osmond, at 41 the oldest of the defunct Osmond
Brothers, who themselves got their show biz start as youngsters.
The Osmond Boys are on a 70-city tour that ends in mid-November,
when they return home to Utah.
   ``There's a lot of screaming girls,'' Michael said. ``It makes
it a lot more fun on stage.''
   They released an album, ``The Osmond Boys,'' last month that
includes a song written by Donny Osmond, ``Wait on Love.''
   They're developing their own style _ no flashy costumes _ but
Alan Osmond, who manages his Osmond Boys, said it's like reliving
his past.
   ``Everyone says they've got the Osmond smile,'' he said. ``We've
had a lot of screaming girls on this tour.''
   He said he's trying to keep things as normal as possible,
keeping them in their schools back home and faxing homework to
their teachers.

   Six years ago Andrew Dice Clay was
banished from the Las Vegas Strip after one performance because his
act was too raunchy.
   But the Diceman returneth. Clay had three sellout shows at
Bally's resort last week and if Dice fans were fearful of him
cleaning up his act, they need not have worried.
   One woman in the front row became a target for the evening of
sexually explicit shots by the comedian as he graphically described
his sexual appetite and questioned hers.
   Clay said he considers himself ``greatest comic that ever
lived.''
   ``I've created something so unique, so special, people are just
going crazy for it,'' Clay said. ``I'm going to be around for a
long time.''
   He wasn't so confident six years ago when he was bounced from
the lineup at the Comedy Store at the Dunes Hotel, across the Strip
from Bally's, because of his foul language.
   He vowed he would be back and would someday see his name on the
marquee of one of the Strip's glitzy resorts. He realized that goal
when he returned Thursday.
   ``I figured the town just wasn't ready yet,'' he said of his
first experience with Las Vegas.
   When it comes to Dallas, however, Clay apparently feels that
city isn't ready for him. He canceled his Dallas concert because
he's afraid of violating Texas' strict anti-obscenity law, his
publicist said Friday.
   Michael Levine said Clay canceled the show, scheduled for
Sunday, because ``we feared the possibility that Dice might be
subject to arrest, embarrassment and subsequently jailed.''

   Country music star Ronnie Milsap says in
a new book that he has no love for his mother, who abandoned him.
   Milsap, who was born blind, said in his autobiography ``Almost
Like a Song'' that she abandoned him when he was a 1-year-old
infant.
   ``I don't hate her,'' he wrote. ``I have no feelings for her at
all.''
   Milsap said his mother once asked him for money after he became
a successful entertainer.
   ``Why would I want to see her? Motherhood means more than just
giving birth,'' he writes.
   The book, published recently by McGraw-Hill, is named after one
of Milsap's hit records.

   A television news helicopter crashed
while filming the crowd at a concert by the New Kids on the Block.
Two men aboard the aircraft were injured, officials said.
   The KTBS-TV Channel 3 helicopter apparently clipped a power line
and crashed outside Independence Stadium about 6 p.m. Friday as
crowds were gathering for the concert.
   No one on the ground was injured.
   Helicopter pilot Scott Wallace and KTBS photographer Norris
Carden, both of Shreveport, were flying about 15 feet off the
ground around the stadium to film the 25,000 fans arriving to see
the 8 p.m. concert.
   ``They were doing traffic reports and Norris was shooting video
of the lines,'' said KTBS news producer Sharon Rambin. ``I know
they were landing but I don't know what happened.''
   Hana Kanagawa, with a cinematic group from CBS-Sony Japan, saw
the crash.
   ``I saw the helicopter flying, then bursting into the wires,''
she said. ``It wouldn't move. I saw sparks from the wires, and then
it crashed.''
   Wallace suffered cuts and bruises; Carden complained of severe
back pains, said KTBS News Director Andrew Pontz. The men were kept
overnight Willis-Knighton Medical Center for observation.
   The $75,000 helicopter was a total loss, Pontz said.
   The New Kids on Block, known for their intricately choreographed
routines, their cheerful outlook and their anti-drug message, have
had hits such as ``This One's For the Children,'' and ``I'll Be
Loving You Forever.''
