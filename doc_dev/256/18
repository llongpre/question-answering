   Cindy Walker, ``the queen of country
music songwriters,'' has spent about half a century writing
recognizable songs that have been recorded by such performers as
Elvis Presley and Bing Crosby.
   The veteran composer, who lives in Mexia, Texas, has written more
than 450 songs that have been recorded. She was a finalist this year
for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   The best tunes, she said in a telephone interview, ``are songs
with a face.''
   ``You recognize them. You know them. It's like a person. They
have a face that's outstanding. Other songs don't have a face; you
just hear them, that's all. The really good ones are few and far
between.''
   Two of her best known songs are ``You Don't Know Me'' and ``Dream
Baby.''
   ``You Don't Know Me'' has been recorded by more than 75 singers,
including Presley, Ray Charles, Eddy Arnold, Jerry Vale and Mickey
Gilley. Walker wrote the song in the mid-1950s after Arnold
suggested the title, although he had no music or lyrics to go with
it.
   ``I was in Nashville for a music convention and he said, `I've
got a title for you.' He said you've got to promise me to write it.
I was flippant about it (the title) because it didn't strike me at
the time,'' she said.
   ``It's about someone you think you know but you don't. I came on
home and two months later, I was sitting in my chair in my studio
and that song just started singing itself. I was just carried away
with it.
   ``It took me three weeks to finish. Then I called Eddy and sang
it over the phone to him. He had forgotten about it, but he recorded
it three weeks later.''
   Her song ``Dream Baby'' was written in the mid 1960s and was a
hit by Roy Orbison and later Glen Campbell among others.
   ``It's been recorded by lots of people,'' she said. ``I hate to
name names because I leave someone out.''
   Some of her other songs include ``In the Misty Moonlight,''
``Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me,'' ``China Doll'' and tunes with
a Western flavor such as ``Blue Canadian Rockies,'' ``My Rancho Rio
Grande,'' ``Lone Star Trail'' and ``You're From Texas.''
   For the king of Western swing music, Bob Wills, she wrote
``Bubbles in My Beer,'' ``Cherokee Maiden'' and ``Dusty Skies.''
   Her first big break, though, came in 1942 when she accompanied
her father, a cotton buyer, on a trip to Hollywood. They drove past
the Crosby Building and she decided to try to make an appointment
with Bing Crosby.
   ``I went into the office and asked for Mr. Crosby,'' she
recalled. ``The secretary said Larry or which one. I didn't know
there was but one. So I asked for the first one said named. It was
Larry. He listened and I sang him the song. He said Bing had been
looking for a Western song. He said, `meet me here tomorrow and
we'll let him hear it.' I did.''
   As a result, ``Lone Star Trail'' was recorded by Bing Crosby and
became her first song recorded by someone else.
   ``It started me off,'' she said.
   Later, she signed her own recording contract with Decca Records.
For five years she was a performer and songwriter and appeared in a
few movies but eventually decided to concentrate on composing.
   ``I've always been a songwriter,'' she said. ``Everything was an
offshoot from my writing.''
   Her procedure has been to think of a title and then go from there.
   ``The title tells the story. If you can get a real good title,
you've got something. I always write from the title. I've never
written a song without the title.''
   Melodies flow from the lyrics, she said.
   ``The words and music come together. It just sort of comes to
you. The songs just sing themselves to me. They kind of write
themselves. I just stand back and listen.''
   Walker, who gives her age as ``old enough to know better and
young enough not to care,'' is still writing. Her song, ``Sugar
Moon,'' has recently been recorded by country stars Willie Nelson,
Janie Frickie and K.D. Lang.
   ``I write all the time. It's all I've ever done,'' she said.
