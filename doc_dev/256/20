   Carly Simon has been working hard these days,
doing everything from singing standards dressed in glamorous gowns
to writing songs to recording two albums, scoring a film and
writing children's books.
   She has a sense of achievement. And she's looking forward to
summer like a kid let out of school.
   Her newest album, ``My Romance,'' has 11 standards, plus a new
song co-written by Simon, ``What Has She Got?'' Arista Records
intends to release it with a record of her own songs that will come
out next fall.
   Some of those, written around her birthday, will be about the
passing of time. It will include ``Fisherman's Song,'' which sounds
like a folk song and has Judy Collins and Lucy Simon singing
backup, and ``Have You Seen Me Lately?'' _ a tune Simon wrote for
Meryl Streep to sing in Mike Nichols' upcoming film ``Postcards
From the Edge.''
   Simon did a Home Box Office special in April, with Harry Connick
Jr. as her guest. He played piano on some songs, and performed some
duets.
   ``We only went through them once and it sounds as if we've been
singing together our whole lives,'' Simon said. ``It was magical.
He's one of the most talented people I've ever met. He sings like
(Frank) Sinatra and plays piano like (Thelonius) Monk.''
   On May 6 she sang a few songs with Connick in his show at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   Simon recently watched a video of the one-hour special for the
first time because she had been afraid to watch it. She thought
their duet, ``I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do,'' was ``very
sexy.''
   But she was winging it with her on-stage patter. ``I hate
hearing myself; I feel embarrassed. They left them in; they felt it
lends a sort of down-to-earth quality.''
   For the album, she and pianist Michael Kosarin went through
``piles and piles of songs deciding which were best for my voice,''
winding up with six by Richard Rodgers. Then Marty Paich arranged
for orchestra and conducted.
   ``I can't imagine anybody treating those songs more sensitively
and romantically,'' Simon said. The record was made in three days,
four songs a day.
   She spent one week before the HBO special was shown in scoring
``Postcards From the Edge.''
   ``Fortunately, I was able to mobilize everything in my head and
work with a sense of urgency, panic and drama. It was very much
like studying for the exam when you haven't done the work all
semester.
   ``I think I wrote a great song for Meryl to sing opening the
picture. She sings two other songs, `You Don't Know Me,' the old
Ray Charles song, and one Shel Silverstein wrote.''
   The same week she and Doubleday editor Jacqueline Onassis
finished work on her children's book for next Christmas, ``The Boy
of the Bells.'' Her first children's book was ``Amy the Dancing
Bear,'' out for Christmas 1989. ``I'm going to put out one a year
probably for the rest of my life.''
   Her husband, Jim Hart, who can be seen in the audience at the
special, is finishing a novel.
   Sipping a big mug of tea during an interview, Simon talked about
Jackie O.
   ``She had great suggestions; she helped me enormously,'' she
said. ``The thing I love about her is that she didn't want to
`tighten it up' or take any of my personality out of it. The other
thing I feel is that her work thrills her. She doesn't do it dryly
or coldly. She is perfect for an artistic type of person. If I feel
like I'm just taking up somebody's time, I just feel awful.
   ``She didn't do this editing on `Amy.' That landed on her desk
almost perfect. I must have told that 1,000 times to Sarah and Ben.
This I started from scratch on a day in the sun when I felt like
thinking up a new story. It wasn't honed the way `Amy' was.''
   When her children Sarah, called Sally, 15, and Ben, 13, were
young, Simon made up stories for them.
   ``I loved doing it. I very rarely read to them because they
seemed to go to sleep better if all the lights were out,'' she said.
   ``Amy is a budding aritst. That was a story that Sally
particularly loved. Ben was quite angry that I didn't dedicate it
to him as well.'' She dedicated ``The Boy of the Bells,'' a
Christmas story, to him.
   The reason she wrote down Amy and some of her other bedtime
stories wasn't to publish but so she wouldn't forget them. ``I knew
when I had grandchidren the kids would say, `Remember the one you
used to tell about Amy.' My memory would be completely gone by that
time.''
   In her musical future, Simon wants to sing both her own songs
and standards. She wrote ``Fisherman's Song'' in 20 minutes after
coming home late from recording and finding Ben asleep. ``I smelled
his neck and kissed his eyelids, things he doesn't let me do
because he's 13. I translated that to an unrequited love situation.
A girl sneaks into a loved one's house and lies beside him. It
sounds like an old English folk song. It shows another style of
mine I feel equally at home in.''
   Simon made one previous album of standards, ``Torch,'' in 1981.
``Everybody gives Linda Ronstadt credit for having gone back and
done the standards. I always felt jealous she got all the credit
for it.''
