   Oscar-winning songwriter Jimmy Van
Heusen, who wrote such tunes as ``All the Way,'' ``Love and
Marriage'' and ``High Hopes,'' was remembered upon his death as one
of pop music's most important composers.
   Van Heusen died of a stroke Tuesday night at his desert home
east of Los Angeles, according to a spokesman at the Riverside
County Coroner's Office. He was 77.
   Van Heusen collaborated with such lyricists as Johnny Mercer,
Johnny Burke, Eddie DeLange and most notably, Sammy Cahn. He also
wrote for Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra.
   ``Jimmy Van Heusen was an architect of melody,'' Cahn said
Wednesday. ``When we were writing together, if I would ask him to
add even a grace note to the song, he would sit down and write a
whole new melody.''
   Van Heusen won Academy Awards with Cahn for ``All the Way'' in
1957; ``High Hopes'' in 1959; and ``Call Me Irresponsible'' in
1963. ``High Hopes'' was chosen as the official song for John F.
Kennedy's presidential campaign.
   He and Johnny Burke also won an Oscar for ``Swingin' on a Star''
in 1944.
   ``He was one of the most important composers of American pop
music,'' Cahn said. ``He was considered a composer's composer.''
   The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, Van
Heusen was born Edward Chester Babcock on Jan. 26, 1913, in
Syracuse, N.Y. He adopted the name Van Heusen from the shirt
maker's billboard advertisement.
   In 1928, he was expelled from Central High School in Syracuse
for singing his own composition, entitled, ``My Canary Has Circles
Under Its Eyes.''
   His next-door neighbor in Syracuse was composer Harold Arlen.
When Arlen went to Hollywood in 1933, he asked his brother Jerry
Arlen and Van Heusen to take over his writing duties at New York
City's Cotton Club in Harlem.
   He wrote ``Harlem Hospitality.'' The tune and the show for it
flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight
elevator and plugging tunes until he got a hit when Crosby recorded
``It's the Dreamer in Me'' in 1938.
   By 1940, he was one of Tin Pan Alley's most successful
composers, with 60 songs published in just one season. Hollywood
beckoned, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that
became known as the Gold Dust Twins. Among the words and music they
churned out were the daffy tunes for the Bob Hope and Crosby
``Road'' pictures.
   He wrote ``Swingin' on a Star,'' for Crosby's movie ``Going My
Way.'' The tune ``Love and Marriage'' won a 1955 Emmy and has been
introduced to a new generation of television viewers as the theme
song for ``Married ... With Children.''
   During the summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army
camps with Crosby, sometimes serving as Crosby's pilot.
   In 1955, Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of
motion picture scores that became hits. They also scored the 1965
Broadway musical, ``Skyscraper,'' including ``Everybody has a Right
to Be Wrong.''
   Cahn and Van Heusen also wrote numerous hit songs for Sinatra,
including ``All the Way,'' and the title songs of the albums ``Come
Fly With Me,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Come Dance With Me'' and
``September of My Years.''
   Van Heusen was one of 10 songwriters elected to the Songwriters
Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1971.
   The gregarious Van Heusen loved entertaining, parties, and the
single life. ``I dig chicks, booze, music and Sinatra _ in that
order,'' he told an interviewer in the 1960s.
   Cahn called Van Heusen ``one of the world's greatest swingers.''
   Van Heusen remained a bachelor until September 1969, when he
married Bobbe Brock. He is survived by his wife.
   Private services are scheduled Friday at Desert Memorial Park in
Cathedral City.
