   If any phrase could sum up the career of Richard
Rodgers, it is a lyric from ``No Strings,'' the only musical for
which he wrote both words and music.
   ``The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear are still inside my head,''
sing its lead characters, played originally on Broadway by Diahann
Carroll and Richard Kiley. That search for the perfect melody
echoed throughout Rodgers' career of more than 60 years in the
American musical theater, years that were divided into three
distinctive parts.
   The composer's career _ first with Lorenz Hart, then with Oscar
Hammerstein II and finally with a variety of younger lyricists _ is
celebrated in ``Music by Richard Rodgers,'' to be shown Friday,
March 16, on PBS' ``Great Performances.''
   The show, narrated by Shirley Jones, is studded with film clips
from many Rodgers shows _ as different as ``The Garrick Gaities,''
``Pal Joey'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
   And there is an appreciation of Rodgers, who died in 1979, by
other composers including Andrew Lloyd Webber, Burton Lane, Jerry
Herman and Charles Strouse, as well as remembrances by his widow,
Dorothy Rodgers.
   ``He really was a theater writer,'' she said the other day in an
interview at her Fifth Avenue apartment. ``Unlike some other great
writers _ Irving Berlin, for instance, who was the greatest
songwriter who ever lived _ Dick wrote only for the theater or film
or television.''
   Rodgers gave the impression of being a fast writer, able to dash
off music quickly. That wasn't so, Mrs. Rodgers insists. Before he
began composing he would carefully consider what he wanted to
express _ the emotion he was trying to convey and what he wanted to
say to advance the plot. He also considered practical matters, such
as the musical ability of his stars.
   ``Just before he died, he wrote `I Remember Mama,' for Liv
Ullmann who had a range of very few notes,'' Mrs. Rodgers said.
``It was quite a difficult thing to do, but he accepted all such
challenges.''
   Rodgers always looked for something new to do.
   ``He felt the greatest way to insure failure was to repeat
yourself,'' Mrs. Rodgers said.
   His quest for innovation led to four of his best musicals with
Hart, written after an unsatisfying sojourn to Hollywood in the
early 1930s. These landmarks were ``On Your Toes,'' 1936, with its
use of extended ballet sequences created by George Balanchine;
``Babes in Arms,'' 1937, which starred one of the youngest group of
performers ever to appear on Broadway; ``The Boys From Syracuse,''
1938, one of the most successful musical adaptations of a
Shakespeare comedy, and ``Pal Joey,'' 1940, a sophisticated,
sardonic show with Gene Kelly as its charming anti-hero.
   Rodgers always wrote at home. He didn't have an office until
after ``Carousel'' in 1945 when he and Hammerstein started to
produce shows themselves.
   ``Larry Hart and Oscar Hammerstein worked in totally different
ways,'' Mrs. Rodgers recalled. ``Larry could not be forced to put a
word on paper until he heard the tune. But Oscar wanted the freedom
to write the lyric first. Dick didn't care. He could work either
way.
   ``Sometimes he would close open doors because he preferred not
to feel that people were listening until he finished writing. We
all entered into a conspiracy of pretending that we couldn't hear
him until he was done. And he went along with that. He allowed
himself to be fooled.''
   If there was any question about a tune, Rodgers simply threw it
away and wrote another one, Mrs. Rodgers said, although Hart and
Hammerstein mostly used what their partner wrote.
   ``Once in a while, my daughters and I wouldn't let him forget
something we were crazy about that got lost in the tryout period,''
she said. ``One example is `Getting to Know You' which was called
`Suddenly Lucky' when it was in `South Pacific' and then dropped.
`There's a Small Hotel' was written for `Jumbo' and producer Billy
Rose didn't like it, so it was taken out. Later Dick used it in `On
Your Toes.' But it was rare that he used a song again. He felt that
he could always do better writing a new song for a new situation.''
   The Rodgers and Hart partnership ended in 1943 with Hart's death
at the age of 48 of acute pneumonia complicated by alcoholism.
   ``Larry was brilliant but he was basically a very unhappy man,''
Mrs. Rodgers said. ``And if you read his lyrics, that sadness is
there.''
   Even before Hart's death, Rodgers had begun work on a new
project _ which Hart turned down _ to adapt ``Green Grow the
Lilacs'' into a musical play. His partner was Hammerstein and the
show became ``Oklahoma!''
   ``Oscar was a very methodical man. If he said he would finish
the lyric in a week, it would be finished in a week,'' Mrs. Rodgers
said. ``Once Dick and Oscar decided on the musical they would do,
they spent endless hours discussing every aspect of what kind of
show it would be.''
   After ``Oklahoma!'' the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership
lasted 17 years, and out of it came such classics as ``Carousel,''
``The King and I'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
   Hammerstein died in 1960 of cancer, and Rodgers plunged on alone
with ``No Strings.'' Besides writing both music and lyrics, he did
several interesting things with the show. He put the orchestra on
stage with the actors and took the show's title literally. There
were no stringed instruments in the show.
   Even though Rodgers' last shows, ``Two by Two,'' ``Rex'' and ``I
Remember Mama,'' were unsuccessful they contained soaring melodies.
Such songs as ``I Do Not Know a Day I Did Not Love You,'' ``Away
From You'' and ``You Could Not Please Me More'' are among his most
haunting.
   But even the master had self-doubts about his work.
   ``Oh, yes,'' his wife said. ``at least until he began to work on
the next show. Once he got the first song out, which he called the
first olive out of the jar, then he relaxed and felt confident.''
