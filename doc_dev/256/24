   The latest lyrical blow-up in the summer of 2
Live Crew involves the Geto Boys, a Houston-based rap group whose
talk of murder, rape, robbery and dismemberment scared Geffen
Records off handling their record.
   Geffen's decision this month again raised questions of
censorship and racism in the record industry. But the label says
it's simply a business decision based on lyrics that glamorized
``violence, racism and misogyny.''
   Not so, says the band, accusing the record company of a double
standard when it comes to standards. Some in the industry suggest
the double standard is based on skin color, not song content. And
women's rights groups remain appalled by the group's insensitive
rhymes.
   ``Imagine a mix of N.W.A.'s violent imagery and 2 Live Crew's
sexual nasties,'' the L.A. Times' Steve Hochman wrote of the Geto
Boys. Rappers N.W.A. had their own lyric problems last year, when
police officers nationwide were riled by a song urging violence
against law enforcement.
   The Geto Boys are just as graphic about violence. A sample
lyric: ``Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape. Shouldn't have
had her curtains open, so that's her fate.''
   ``As a business decision, it's probably crazy. This record, with
the publicity, is no doubt going to sell a lot of copies. We're
talking tonnage,'' Bryn Bridenthal, Geffen vice president of media
and artist relations, said about the LP, ``The Geto Boys.''
   ``I was flabbergasted that people would describe violence that
graphically in music. People will think this is like 2 Live Crew,
which is kind of silly, just pure sex,'' she continued. ``I was
frightened by this.''
   Yet Geffen is the label for heavy metal Guns 'N Roses, which was
accused of racism and homophobia in its lyrics, and it distributes
the infamous Andrew Dice Clay, whose scatological, sexist shows
created a furor earlier this year. Clay, like the Geto Boys, is
signed to Def American.
   ``This is the same label which backed Dice and Guns 'N Roses
without any hesitation, even when there was a big flap. You have to
wonder if this inconsistency borders on racism,'' veteran rap
publicist Bill Adler said last week.
   Debbie Bennett, director of public relations for the 2 Live
Crew's Luke Records, was more direct: ``It's easier to single out a
black group on a small label than any white group. Right now, it
seems like the racist, easy thing to pick on.''
   The controversy is the latest round in the record
labeling-censorship battle. The 2 Live Crew remain under fire for
their ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' album, which was ripped for its
graphic sexual content and its denigration of women.
   In Louisiana, a bill requiring labeling for recordings with
potentially offensive lyrics passed the Legislature but was vetoed.
   Artists are striking back. Bruce Springsteen allowed 2 Live Crew
to sample his ``Born in the U.S.A.'' for the group's rap response
to its critics, ``Banned in the U.S.A.'' Neil Young included a song
with an obscenity on his upcoming LP to insure it gets a parental
advisory sticker.
   As for the Geto Boys themselves, lead rapper Bushwick Bill has
defended his lyrics as real-life reports from Houston's destitute
Fifth Ward. Publicist Heidi Robinson says to focus on the salacious
side of the group is to miss the point.
   ``This band is very, very three-dimensional. There are reasons
for the songs they've written,'' said Robinson. ``To dismiss them
as four guys doing this for shock value is to take them simply at
face value.''
   There's little doubt about the offensive content of the black
group's lyrics. ``Mind of a Lunatic'' details the rape and murder
of a woman; ``Trigga Happy Nigga'' is about a liquor store heist
and the slaying of a stool pigeon; ``Gangster of Love'' includes a
litany of graphic sex.
   ``This art perpetuates and makes acceptable certain violence
against women. We think that is abhorrent,'' said Francoise
Jacobsohn, president of the New York chapter of the National
Organization for Women.
   Jacobsohn hailed Geffen's decision, but questioned why the Geto
Boys were singled out: ``We're pleased that misogyny and violence
are out, but we think the same set of rules should apply to Andrew
Dice Clay.''
   Publicist Robinson mentions the positive things the band is
about: ``Life in the Fast Lane'' is an anti-drug song. The group
wants to funnel some of its profits back into the Fifth Ward for a
boys' club. They encourage black youth to get an education.
   ``To focus on violence and sexism is to be flat,
one-dimensional,'' she said. ``They have an awful lot of good
things, too.''
