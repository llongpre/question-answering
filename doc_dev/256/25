   Pianist and composer Robert D.
Emmerich, who played with the Tommy Dorsey band and wrote songs for
Fats Waller, has died at age 83.
   Emmerich died Friday at Florida Medical Center, and a funeral
was held Sunday.
   Emmerich wrote more than 100 songs, including ``Beat It Out,''
``Woe Is Me'' and 10 others for Waller. He wrote ``Our Love,''
first sung by Dinah Shore, and ``No. 10 Lullaby Lane,'' introduced
by Kate Smith.
   Emmerich, who collaborated with Buddy Bernier and Joseph Meyer,
wrote a song called ``The Big Apple'' in the 1940s, said his wife,
Miriam.
   ``Walter Winchell liked it so much he started calling New York
`the Big Apple,''' his wife said.
   Emmerich also was a vaudeville, radio and night club performer.
   ``Bob was a self-taught piano player who couldn't read a note of
music, but he had some left hand,'' Mrs. Emmerich said.
   Emmerich, who was born in New York City, moved to Florida nine
years ago.
