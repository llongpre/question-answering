   There's a big difference, say Douglas Bernstein
and Denis Markell, between writing for a small stage and the small
screen.
   ``On television, you write a joke, then someone else decides if
it's funny or not,'' says Markell, the bearded, bespectacled member
of an up-and-coming writing team that at one time turned out TV
scripts for the likes of Ricky Schroeder on ``Silver Spoons'' and
for a short-lived fairy tale sitcom called ``The Charmings.''
   ``Everything goes up a level to that someone else and gets
rewritten, then up another level and rewritten and up a third level
and rewritten,'' Bernstein adds. ``Consequently, when you put names
of your own friends in the script, by the time it gets on the air,
the names are the friends of the producer.
   ``In our revue `Showing Off,' we've got all our friends' names in
it and nobody can change them,'' he says with a laugh.
   With their own show, Bernstein and Markell are helping to
resuscitate a neglected theatrical art form _ the topical musical
comedy revue. At one time, New York embraced those bright, witty
little shows, productions such as Ben Bagley's ``Shoestring Revue''
and his salute to Cole Porter or Julius Monk's entertainments at the
Plaza and Upstairs at the Downstairs.
   ``The revue puts such a premium on the words and the wit and
that's something that tends to get lost on Broadway today,'' says
Bernstein, who also is one of the show's four performers. ``The
revue asks an audience to sit down and pay attention. If you blink
or turn away, you sometimes miss the whole premise of a song.''
   ``Showing Off,'' currently running in a small Upper West Side
nightspot called Steve McGraw's, pokes fun at a variety of current
topics, although don't look for jokes about such easy targets as
Donald Trump, Dan Quayle or Leona Helmsley.
   Among its more unusual subjects are show-biz rabbis, video rental
addiction, New York's 72nd Street, a man who has a crush on a local
television anchorwoman and what Bernstein and Markell call
``S.I.P.,'' those self-important people like maitre d's, telephone
receptionists and box office personnel who enjoy their moments of
control over everybody else.
   ``We don't take the audience for granted,'' Markell says. ``We
assume that they come to the show with a certain amount of
intelligence, and we don't insult them. Rather than making an
audience scared, it makes them feel like they are contributing to
the show.''
   The collaboration between Markell and Bernstein is unusual. Both
men write music and lyrics. They don't divide the tasks so there is
a lot of trading back and forth of ideas.
   ``Music is a lot harder to write together,'' Bernstein says.
``And after it's done, you don't know who did what.''
   Who decides what the final version will be?
   ``In `Showing Off,' we have a wonderful director, Michael
Leeds,'' Bernstein says. ``The director, for us, has always served
as the ultimate referee.''
   Although only in their early 30s, both men were steeped in the
traditions of musical comedy.
   ``Denis and I were both lucky enough to be brought up by parents
who valued and respected the revue form,'' Bernstein recalls. His
father wrote for hotel revues in the 1950s. Markell's father was a
television producer as well as a set designer in the early days of
New York television.
   ``We listened to recordings of revues and were always told: `Look
who wrote these songs. This is where Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock
wrote their songs. This is where Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones wrote
their songs. And look what they went on to do,''' Bernstein adds.
``We've always viewed the musical revue as a not very distant source
for a lot of the great musical writers.''
   Bernstein and Markell met some 15 years ago at a music camp in
Raymond, Maine, where they would write ditties like ``The Bassoon
Teacher's Birthday.'' The two would sit on the main porch at the
camp's lodge and talk about current films such as ``Blazing
Saddles'' or favorite comics such as Woody Allen and Robert Klein
and make fun of the other kids at camp.
   Both writers attended Amherst College in Massachusetts where they
created a series of satirical revues. Among their performers was
Prince Albert of Monaco. ``He played a frog who turned into a
prince,'' Bernstein says.
   They came to New York in the fall of 1980. Markell ended up at
the BMI Workshop, a training ground for aspiring musical theater
writers guided at that time by the legendary conductor Lehman Engel
and later by such theater people as Maury Yeston, Ed Kleban and Alan
Mencken.
   A year later, the two were working for director Martin Charnin of
``Annie'' fame. He was looking for young, unknown writers to
contribute material to a revue, ``Upstairs at O'Neal's.''
   They wrote two of its brightest numbers _ ``Something,'' a parody
of a song called ``Nothing'' from ``A Chorus Line,'' and ``Momma's
Turn,'' a number supposedly sung by the mothers of New York drama
critics.
   A chance to work in television and films lured them to California
in 1986.
   ``We were lucky because an agent had seen a sample script of
ours,'' Markell says, ``and told us, `Come out to California.'''
   For eight months, they learned the discipline of television
writing, working on a schedule and reacting quickly to change.
   But their hearts belonged in New York and they returned. An early
draft of ``Showing Off'' was done in early 1987 and evolved into the
current production two years later. Now they are writing the book
and lyrics for a HBO project that will have music by Marvin
Hamlisch. But ``Showing Off'' is still on their minds. There may be
Los Angeles and Chicago editions of the show with new material
tailored to those two cities.
   ``We are determined to make the show feel specific so that the
audience would feel that they were at a special place,'' Bernstein
says. ``But at the same time we try to tackle issues and themes like
the man who has the crush on the TV anchorwoman, which are really
broader. So it's not really limited to New York.''
