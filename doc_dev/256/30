   Firebrand fiddler Charlie Daniels called
the devil a nasty name in his million-selling record, ``The Devil
Went Down to Georgia.'' He also told the Russians where they could
go in his song, ``In America.''
   His new album, ``Homesick Heroes,'' is less polemical and
contains music that best portrays his band's style.
   ``It's what we are,'' he said. ``Hard driving music.''
   The rollicking album is the 18th in 17 years for the
irrepressible five-piece rock-country band that has performed in
all 50 states and several foreign countries.
   In it, Daniels plays a blazing fiddle to the flash point in
``Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues,'' a hit single. He plays
rousing guitar licks on other songs, and sings sassy, gritty vocals
on still others.
   The LP is a turn away from his last album, ``Powder Keg,'' which
he described as the most rock-oriented LP he has recorded.
   ``It didn't do too well at all,'' Daniels said in an interview.
``It's still selling, but it never really got off the ground.''
   ``It was time for a change. The new album is a career move.''
   Country fans will welcome the sound from the ``kingfish of
Southern roots music'' whose traditional garb is a huge bullrider
cowboy hat, cowboy boots, jeans and vest.
   He and his band are best known for their Grammy-winning 1980
hit, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia,'' the story of a feverish
fiddle contest between the devil and a boy named Johnny in which he
called the devil a mild obscenity. The single sold 1.6 million
copies and the ``Million Mile Reflections'' album that contained it
sold 2.3 million.
   ``It had mass appeal,'' Daniels said about the song. ``I guess
the lyrics of the song were responsible for 70-75 percent of the
popularity and the fiddle and the novelty value had a lot to do
with it.''
   The blunt lyrics in that song were similar to the ones in his
``In America,'' in which he issued his memorable directive to the
Soviets amid a burst of American pride.
   On topical subjects, Daniels' ``American Farmer'' focused on the
plight of agriculture in the mid-1980s. ``Still in Saigon'' was
about a former soldier haunted by his Vietnam experience. Other
songs by the band, such as ``Long Haired Country Boy'' and ``Uneasy
Rider,'' are more satirical.
   ``I poke fun at rednecks, hippies, politicians, all kinds of
people,'' said Daniels, a native of Wilmington, N.C.
   The band traveled 75,000 miles last year, making 116 concert
stops. In 1986, they grossed nearly $14 million and drew more than
750,000 paid admissions.
   Amid all the travel and hit records, Daniels has done a little
acting. He was in ``Murder, She Wrote'' and ``Lone Star Kid'' on
the Public Broadcasting Service.
   He and the band were featured in the movie, ``Urban Cowboy,''
and their ``Stroker's Theme'' was the title track for Burt
Reynolds' movie ``Stroker Ace.''
   Daniels' writing has not been restricted to songs. In 1985, he
wrote a book of short stories, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.''
   Daniels said one of his proudest achievements has been keeping
his band members together so long. Three members have been with him
at least 14 years.
   ``It seems like I've had Taz (DiGregorio, his keyboard player)
since two days after he was born,'' Daniels said.
   ``We're sincere,'' he said about the band's success and its
togetherness. ``I keep a 12-month payroll. We have the philosophy
that we do the best we can all the time. We get to stretch out some
as musicians. Everybody gets to use their ideas and share in the
songwriting royalties. I try to treat people well and look after
our folks.
   ``We try real hard,'' he said. ``I want to do the best I can do:
cut every record the best, write every song the best, do every show
the best, have the most efficient organization in the music
business.
   ``I want the deejays to pick up a Charlie Daniels Band record
and say, `Here's a record by the Charlie Daniels Band and I want to
play this.'
   ``Quality. You can't beat it.''
