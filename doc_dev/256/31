   They are young and talented and plan to retire
by age 25.
   LeVert, the rhythm and blues pop trio of Marc Gordon and
brothers Gerald and Sean LeVert, has just released its third album,
``Just Coolin,''' a balanced collection of funk and melodic ballads
with snippets of dialogue interspersed throughout.
   ``We recorded those dialogue pieces spur of the moment, no
script. We were just acting silly and having fun,'' said Gerald
LeVert, a 22-year-old keyboardist and vocalist.
   But he takes a slightly different attitude towards most of the
music he has created. ``I get tired of hearing every album because
I wish I could do it differently,'' he said. ``You keep seeing how
you can do it better. ... I still have a lot to prove to the
industry.''
   His perfectionism, coupled with 24-year-old Marc's technical
expertise, has led to the development of their writing and
production team. ``Just Coolin''' showcases LeVert's complete
production responsibilities.
   ``It's not that I want to give up music by the time I'm 25, it's
just that I'd like complete control,'' Gerald LeVert said. ``The
hardest thing about the business is trusting people, and that's why
it's good to establish yourself as more than just an entertainer.''
   Gerald LeVert and Gordon have many projects under way, including
collaborations with James Ingram and Stephanie Mills, and managing
a new group, ``The Rude Boys.''
   The two also contributed to Miki Howard's duet with Gerald
LeVert, ``That's What Love Is,'' a Top 5 R&amp;B hit. They also helped
make Troop's ``Mamacita'' a success. The record was co-produced by
Gerald and Sean's father, Eddie LeVert, lead singer of the O'Jays.
Gerald LeVert and Gordon recently produced the latest O'Jays
record, ``Serious,'' which they said was their biggest challenge to
date.
   Ever since summers of being on the road with the O'Jays, Gerald
LeVert has thrived on the energy generated between the band and the
audience. He started writing songs with Gordon, who also plays
piano, when they met as teen-agers growing up in Ohio.
   ``My father would listen to the songs and would always say,
`Something's missing,''' Gerald LeVert recalled. ``Then we finally
started writing some good songs.
   ``We put out an album, `I Get Hot,' on an independent label
which sold 1,000 copies _ if that much. But we had a pretty big
record off that called, `I'm Still.' We did some shows and from
there we got the record deal from Atlantic.''
   In 1986, they released ``Bloodline.'' The first two singles from
this collection rocketed to the Top 10, with ``(Pop Pop Pop Pop)
Goes My Mind'' making it to No. 1 on the charts. In 1987, LeVert
came out with its second LP, ``The Big Throwdown,'' which yielded
three Top 10 singles, including the No. 1 ``Casonova,'' which
played on the soundtrack to the movies ``Fatal Beauty'' and ``The
Pick-Up Artist.''
   The group had its third No. 1 hit last year with ``Addicted to
You,'' which was featured in the movie ``Coming to America.''
   ``I think our romantic music is very sensuous, and our uptempo
stuff is something everyone can relate to _ it's funky,'' Gerald
LeVert said.
   ``I write songs thinking, `If we do this live, will it make them
groove or the girls scream?' But first I write for me. I'm very
critical. I don't think I'd write terrible, slop songs.''
   The title song on the new LP was originally written by Gerald
LeVert for the rapper Heavy D to perform.
   ``He took one look at what I wrote and did not like it. He wrote
another one in 10 minutes and that's the rap on the record,''
Gerald LeVert said.
   ``If my father doesn't like a song I've written, I'd think
twice. If I like it enough though, it's going to happen if I work
with it. It's only one person's opinion.''
   LeVert's energetic performances display the group's enthusiasm
for wanting to make the audience happy.
   ``That's the whole key: If you can laugh and have fun doing your
work, people see that and they feed off that,'' Gerald LeVert said.
``I love people singing along live and with the record. It's a
great high. The lyrics, harmonies and melodies are very important
for me, and it's important for people to be able to hum and whistle
your music.
   ``Usually I first come up with a concept, title or groove. I get
my ideas from TV, things I read, when I'm on the airplane _ from
anything. Then I give the idea to Marc and he does the music.''
   Gerald LeVert doesn't think LeVert will be changing its musical
formula, but he's toying with the idea of doing a solo album.
   ``I would want to do some social commentary, talk about
different things like family, the record industry, deceitful
women,'' he said with a big laugh.
   As far as the harmonious, close-knit group is concerned, Gerald
LeVert feels LeVert shows more signs of longevity than other groups
in the business.
   ``We have more finesse, more polish,'' he said. ``We're
vocalists. We don't need extra props. If we got a mike and a lamp,
we are going to be able to do what we do.''
