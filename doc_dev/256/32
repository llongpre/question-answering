   Pop star Stevie Wonder says justice is sweet
following a jury's rejection of a $25 million claim that his
Oscar-winner song ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' was stolen
from another songwriter.
   The plaintiff, Lloyd Chiate, claimed Wonder's song, part of the
movie soundtrack for ``Woman in Red,'' was taken from a song he
co-wrote titled, ``I Just Called To Say.''
   ``I knew the truth in my heart all along,'' said Wonder. ``I'm
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in
this courtroom. But I do appreciate and respect justice.''
   Wonder, 39, offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing
a song with Chiate and Lee Garrett, co-author of ``I Just Called To
Say,'' and donate the proceeds to charity.
   ``Then we all really win,'' Wonder said.
   Chiate wasn't present when the jury announced its verdict
Thursday. His attorney, Herbert Dodell, said his client was wronged
by a star-struck jury and a biased judge.

   Soviet beauty queen Anna Gorbunova
declared her delight at becoming a ``true Christian'' after her
baptism in a Ukrainian Orthodox church here.
   Ms. Gorbunova, the Moscow secretary who became the first Miss
USSR last year, said she loved Sydney so much she decided to be
baptized Thursday during a promotional trip to Australia.
   ``I was very nervous in the ceremony; I had goose bumps all over
myself,'' Ms. Gorbunova said through an interpreter.
   In the Soviet Union, especially in the period before President
Mikhail Gorbachev consolidated power, ``there have been too many
restrictions concerning the practice of religion,'' said Ms.
Gorbunova's manager, Alexander Djamirze.

   Actress Valerie Harper says the suicide of Joan
Rivers' husband shook her out of the doldrums after she was fired
from her top-rated NBC sitcom.
   ``The week I was fired was the same week that Joan Rivers lost
her husband. I thought, `My God, I'm blessed.' Think of people with
real problems, who live with illness, with drive-by shootings in
their neighborhoods,'' Harper told USA Weekend magazine in Sunday's
edition.
   In her new show, ``City,'' Harper appears opposite her old show,
``The Hogan Family.'' She said she had some fears about becoming a
Hollywood pariah when she sued producers of ``Hogan'' following her
dismissal.
   ``There was definitely a buzz around town: `Has she gone mad?'
If I'd been a young actress ... I might have been destroyed,''
Harper said.

   A criminal charge was filed against a man who
allegedly wrote a letter threatening the life of singer Debbie
Gibson.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas M. Bauer said Thursday that
Richard C. Pelfrey, 37, was charged with mailing threatening
communications and faced a maximum sentence of 20 years
imprisonment and a $250,000 fine if convicted.
   Authorities said the letter mailed to Joseph Gibson, Ms.
Gibson's father, included a threat to kill Miss Gibson if she
played at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls. She performed at
the center Sept. 13 without incident.
   Pelfrey's lawyer, Susan Pritchard, did not return telephone
calls Thursday.

   A free-lance photographer claimed he was
roughed up by two of rock star Janet Jackson's bodyguards at a
hotel.
   Doug Mays, 40, of Moss Point, Miss., wanted the bodyguards
arrested after the scuffle Wednesday, but police officer Richard
Baily said he couldn't file charges because the parties involved
gave conflicting statements.
   Mays and his wife, Sammie, 32, said they were headed for the
15th floor of the hotel to meet ``Good Morning America'' host
Charlie Gibson who was doing his television program from Pensacola.
   Mays said they tried to get off the elevator on the 14th floor,
reserved for members of the Jackson tour, in search of a soft drink
machine. The photographer said he didn't know Jackson was in town.
   The bodyguards ``shoved me back in the elevator,'' said Mays,
whom police said was not hurt.
   The bodyguards, Jack Colen, 56, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.,
and Marcus David Johnson, 30, of Huntington Beach, Calif., told
police they pushed Mays after he used racial slurs when they told
him to leave.

   Boxing heavyweight champion James ``Buster''
Douglas' next fight may be in a courtroom, courtesy of a breach of
contract lawsuit filed by promoter Don King.
   King is seeking several million dollars in damages and also is
asking the U.S. District Court in Manhattan for an injunction to
prevent Douglas from fighting without his involvement.
   Douglas won the title with a shocking 10th-round knockout of
Mike Tyson on Feb. 11 in Tokyo. Douglas has said he will not fight
for King because the promoter challenged the result of the bout by
claiming that Douglas got a long count after being knocked down in
the eighth round.
   King's lawsuit claims he had an agreement with Douglas to
promote future fights.
   Douglas signed a conditional contract with Steve Wynn's Mirage
hotel-casino in Las Vegas for two fights, the first probably
against Evander Holyfield.
