   An unlikely history and lingering mystery mingle
in a song that infused the old, rural South, emerged in the civil
rights movement, gained popularity and now has advanced into the
loftiest hymnals.
   Aspects of the song, ``Amazing Grace,'' are somewhat amazing
themselves, and haunting.
   ``There's a kind of wonderful calm that I feel when I sing this,
a kind of uncomplicated feeling, the way one felt as a child,''
says operatic contralto Jessye Norman.
   Country singer Johnny Cash says it's ``a song with no guile . .
. straight-ahead, honest, gut-level and heart-level. When I sing
that song, I could be in a dungeon, or I could have chains all over
me, but I'd be free as a breeze.''
   The lyrics were by a reformed 18th-century slave trader, the
variable melody clouded in folk origins, conceivably among slaves.
It imbued their ensuing culture and later spread through a
sophisticated world.
   Now a favorite American hymn, ``Amazing Grace'' also turns up
occasionally in rock concerts, and has been rendered in some
foreign languages.
   ``There is a power of reconciliation that takes place when I
hear it,'' says broadcaster Bill Moyers, who depicts the story and
impact of the hymn in an 80-minute show being presented Wednesday
by the Public Broadcasting Service.
   The first verse goes: ``Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, that
saved a wretch like me! I once was lost but now am found, was blind
but now I see.''
   The words were by John Newton, skipper of a British slave ship
who traded for human cargo in West Africa. A storm at sea sparked
religious faith and he later became an Anglican minister in Olney,
England.
   ``I was once an active instrument in a business at which my
heart now shudders,'' Newton wrote in his journals. ``A common
drunkard or profligate is a petty sinner to what I was . . . Oh, to
grace how great a debtor.''
   Newton became an advocate for abolishing the slave trade. His
journals describing its brutality helped an ally, William
Wilberforce, win British abolition of it.
   `` 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears
relieved,'' goes the second verse. ``How precious did that grace
appear the hour I first believed.''
   In the film, singer Judy Collins says:
   ``It was always the song that gave me an inner experience of
another dimension. I always feel that there's a mystical territory
between me and the audience.
   ``It's not just me singing . . . Somewhere or other, there is
some experience going on which gives something to them and gives
something to me, that's more than the sum of any of us.''
   The third verse goes, ``The Lord has promised good to me, his
word my hope secures; he will my shield and portion be as long as
life endures.''
   Says gospel singer Marion Williams: ``It gets to most everybody.
It gets to the heart of men.''
   An aged black ``wiregrass'' song leader, Dewey Williams, says at
his 91st birthday party in Ozark, Ark.: ``I feel good, I just can't
help it when I get to singing (that song). It just do something to
me.''
   The show ranges over many settings, from 18th-century sailing
ships to concert halls, from prisons to Mississippi voter
registration drives, from cemeteries to ``shape note'' singing in
Holly Springs, Ga.
   Says a Holly Springs man, ``It's just a good song, wrote like
it's supposed to be wrote.''
   On a tour of Japan by the Boys Choir of Harlem, director Walter
Turnbull says some foreigners don't understand the song's words,
``but it has such a universal flavor and the meldoy itself is so
beautiful it captures people.''
   The fourth verse goes, ``Through many dangers, toils, and
snares, I have already come; 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus
far, and grace will lead me home.''
   In a Huntsville, Texas, prison, an inmate says: ``I couldn't
hardly sing that song and get through, you know, four verses of it
without choking up . . . all I could do was just be humming and
crying.''
   Shown engraved on Newton's tombstone are his words:
   ``Once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa,
was by the rich mercy of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
preserved, restored, pardoned and appointed to preach the faith he
had long labored to destroy.''
   The fifth verse goes, ``When we've been there ten thousand
years, bright shining as the sun, we've no less days to sing God's
praise than when we'd first begun.''
   A Harlem choir boy says of his reaction to the song:
   ``I feel like I'm walking on a beach, and like wind is hitting
me, and stuff like that. That's how I feel about it. Not like a
rough wind; like a soft wind, just coming by, like a breeze.''
