   Lamont Dozier wrote his first song when he was 11
years old, taking encouragement from a Detroit schoolteacher.
   He handed in a poem at school and the teacher put it on the
board. ``Usually the teacher would change the poem every month,'' he
recalled. ``My poem stayed on the board six months. That stimulated
me a lot to continue my writing. That lady did a lot for me. Later,
I managed to plunk out some melody on the piano to put with it.''
   Now 47, Dozier's supervising his 9-year-old son, Beau, in a Los
Angeles recording studio: ``He's a good little singer and a good
little songwriter.'' Dozier and singer-songwriter-drummer-actor Phil
Collins won a Grammy award and a Golden Globe for ``Two Hearts,'' a
song they composed for the movie ``Buster.''
   ``I was a nervous wreck on stage,'' Dozier said. ``I had blocked
it out of my mind. I hadn't entertained any ideas of winning it. My
heart just went boom boom. It was like I was going to pass out or
something.
   ``I was never nominated for anything. I've had gold and platinum
records over the years but no awards. The Golden Globe was the
first.''
   For 12 years, Dozier was part of a songwriting team known as
Holland-Dozier-Holland, which rose to fame at Motown Records. Dozier
and the Holland brothers, Eddie and Brian, were responsible for
``How Sweet It Is,'' ``You Can't Hurry Love'' and ``Stop in the Name
of Love,'' among others. Their biggest selling song was ``You Keep
Me Hanging On,'' a hit for the Supremes, Vanilla Fudge and Kim Wilde.
   But Dozier isn't bitter that he wasn't nominated for awards
before: ``Without sounding goody-goody or something, I'm a
songwriter. Just to hear my songs on the radio is reward enough _ as
corny as it may sound.
   ``I'm thrilled about all of this. The main thing is making the
product good. If it's not good, I don't want an award for it. First
and most important is the public and what they think of what I do.
That's who I'm writing it for.''
   Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1968 and ended their
partnership in 1972 because Dozier wanted to pursue a singing
career. ``I'll take another serious stab at it this year. Toward the
end of the year, hopefully I'll have an album out. I have interest
from two or three labels.''
   He's also writing a musical, ``Angels,'' and hopes to launch it
on Broadway. ``I'm the creator of the book and about 14 pieces of
music for it. I've had meetings with Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really
Useful Theater Company. Warner Bros. has signed me to a major
publishing deal because of it.''
   Dozier has been approached to write an autobiography titled ``The
Man in the Middle,'' because of the Holland-Dozier-Holland billing,
but he turned that down. ``There are some pages I want to fill in
first. I'm just starting.''
   Collins is the biggest star with whom Dozier has collaborated. He
recounted their meeting: ``I went backstage at one of his shows
here, you know how you do. I didn't know if he'd know what I did; I
was a little bit reluctant to take up his time.
   ``When I went in, an Atlantic Records publicity guy said, `I have
Lamont Dozier here.' He swung around and literally came and grabbed
and hugged me. It just blew me away. Come to find out, he collects
Motown memorabilia and I was one of his favorite writers. He wanted
my autograph and grabbed a guy to take a picture. He was totally
uncool.
   ``Shortly afterwards he called me. Did I have material for an
Eric Clapton album, `August,' he was producing? I sent him one
thing. He called again. Did I have another one? I dropped off a tape
at the studio. I was driving in my driveway and my wife, Barbara,
said, `Phil's on the line.' I heard the music in the background.
They'd already started recording it before I got home.''
   He was able to instantly submit a song because he writes four or
five hours a day. ``I've written over 700 songs and have some 400 or
500 unpublished and unrecorded. I make demos in my home.''
   Simply Red's latest album has a few Dozier songs on it. Boy
George's debut solo album has four. Dozier is now working with Steve
Perry on his new solo LP, talking with Lionel Richie about his
upcoming album and is writing eight songs with Collins.
   A year after the Clapton project, Dozier says, Collins was in
California. ``He dropped by the house. He wanted to talk about a
film, `Buster,' he had decided to do. He said he didn't want to have
anything to do with the music. He wanted to make a serious attempt
at acting.
   ``I came up with three things. I put the tracks down to give him
a feeling of what I was going for. I had titles; I hummed the
melodies. All of a sudden he wanted to get involved. He decided to
write the lyrics; he wanted Buster's point of view.''
   He also wrote ``Loco in Acapulco'' for ``Buster.''
