   EDITOR'S NOTE - Rap has emerged as the most controversial form
of youthful expression since rock 'n' roll in the 1950s. There was
a time when Elvis was considered obscene, and had gone ``too far.''
Now groups such as the Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew have gone much
further.

   Houston rappers The Geto Boys are scatological,
misogynist, violent and homophobic, their critics say.
   Maybe, they respond, but they're not apologetic.
   ``The Geto Boys would rather be hated for what we are than loved
for what we are not,'' says Bushwick Bill, one-fourth of the
controversial crew whose new album made headlines before a single
copy was available.
   Hated? You've got it.
   An Indiana plant refused to press copies of ``The Geto Boys''
because of its offensive lyrics. Geffen Records backed out of a
national record distribution deal for the same reason. Two record
store chains will not sell the group's national debut.
   The National Organization for Women charges their lyrics promote
violence against women. The flap over their songs such as ``Mind of
a Lunatic'' and a pair of unprintable titles caused some people,
including ex-New York mayor Edward Koch to add their voices to the
anti-Geto Boys chorus.
   ``The Geto Boys sing rap songs so foul that their own record
company refuses to distribute their album,'' wrote Koch, who
decried their ``sickening lyrics'' and suggested the group
encouraged ``rape and mayhem.''
   Does all this bother Bushwick Bill? He responds with an
obscenity, a ``no'' and a fast-paced defense of his record.
   ``I always knew they can't stop the truth. The truth is going to
be heard. We're holding a mirror up to America, and letting them
see their naked selves. Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of
men? That's the mirror we're holding up,'' says Bushwick.
   It's also a mirror of Houston's Fifth Ward, the desolate
neighborhood the group once called home. Although none of the four
lives there anymore, it remains their base of operations.
   The band celebrated the release of its new album last month with
a party at Club Obsession in the old 'hood. The loyalty lies in
part with their support there; the band sold 500,000 copies of its
last album on the local Rap-A-Lot label before signing a national
deal.
   ``The Fifth Ward is shotgun shacks, houses ined up beside each
other. There's a lot of wild dogs, prostitution, needles on the
floor,'' says Bushwick. ``If you're walking down the street and you
look wrong, somebody'll beat your ... .''
   How it was growing up in the Fifth Ward is reflected in their
lyrics, in such songs as ``Assassins'' and ``City Under Siege.''
   ``Some kids never even make the milk cartons. That's why we can
hit hard like that, because that's how we grew up,'' says Bushwick.
``You step out the front door, it's survival. ... You only get a
minute to pray and a second to die.''
   The Geto Boys are not alone in the controversy over rap lyrics.
But unlike 2 Live Crew, who were recently acquitted of obscenity
charges in Florida, the Geto Boys choose not to use the First
Amendment as a explanation for their lyrics.
   ``According to the same Constitution, we're considered
three-fourths of a human being,'' Bushwick said. ``The First
Amendment doesn't apply to us. ... We've never been protected by
any American law.''
   The one song that has drawn the most criticism is ``Mind of a
Lunatic,'' in which the band details the rape and murder of a
random victim chosen only because her curtains are open. Bushwick
defends the song, comparing it to the work of Alfred Hitchcock.
   ``I don't get it. When Alfred Hitchcock directed `Psycho,' he
filmed from a maniac's point of view: his fears, his feelings, his
thoughts,'' says Bushwick. ``That's how we wrote `Mind of a
Lunatic.' Alfred did the same thing. ... I think it has a lot to do
with race.''
   The group, including the diminutive Bushwick, is all black.
   The flap over the album hasn't persuaded anyone in the band to
change his approach. In fact, says Bushwick, it has strengthened
their resolve to get it done their own way.
   ``We'll keep on calling it the way we see it,'' concludes
Bushwick. ``Just because it's not going on in your neighborhood
doesn't mean it isn't going on.''
