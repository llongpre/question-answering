   With a wicked smile and a wicked song,
Christopher Mason lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust.
   He sings about the foibles, follies and fads of high-powered,
high-society folk like Ivana (Trump), Nancy (Reagan), David
(Rockefeller), Brooke (Astor) and William (Paley). And they love it.
   In less than two years, the sprite-like, 27-year-old Mason has
gone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star. Now
he's appearing through May at the fabled Oak Room in the Algonquin
Hotel where he's singing not only about people like Mrs. Trump and
her yacht and Mrs. Reagan and her new life in California, but about
such topics as the water shortage and trash TV. He's a combination
of Cole Porter and Tom Lehrer with a bit of Noel Coward thrown in
for good measure.
   ``I write the words and the music. I play the piano and sing,''
Mason explains. ``So if the evening is terrible, it's all my
fault.''
   It was never hard to get Mason to perform. He was born in
England, the son of an opera singer and a civil servant. At the age
of 3, he saw ``The Sound of Music,'' came home, sat down at the
piano and played every song from the show _ with one finger.
   ``I used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because I'd be
playing Chopin or Beethoven, and I'd always think of what I thought
was a nicer way of finishing a phrase,'' he says, recalling his
precocious childhood.
   At Cambridge, Mason majored in English and art history, but when
he came to New York, he worked long hours for little pay in public
relations and fund-raising. But he got to observe the rich at close
quarters. He also got to attend parties, lots of them.
   ``When there was nothing left to revive a party, I was thrown
toward the piano to play and sing,'' he says. ``People said, `Why
don't you do this all the time?'''
   He finally did. His big break came last May when he was hired by
fashion designer Mario ``the Prince of Chintz'' Buatta to play for
a society dinner at the New York Public Library.
   Mason wrote five new songs for the occasion. ``If you are
burning with the love of learning, write a check to the public
library,'' he crooned in his best fund-raising voice. But he also
wrote songs about Brooke Astor and Annette Reed, two of the biggest
supporters of the library. The ditties suggested that Mrs. Astor
change her first name from Brooke to Book and Mrs. Reed spell her
last name R-e-a-d.
   Mason was a big success, and people began calling to ask if he'd
appear at their parties, playing original songs.
   ``I was terrified of asking for money,'' he says. ``I'm English,
so I'm terrible at dealing with money.''
   At first, Mason would immediately say yes to a job and then ask
about the fee. Often it was less than $500. Today, he has an agent
at William Morris and his price for an evening's work can go as
high as $3,000.
   He serenaded Mrs. Trump last summer aboard the Trump Princess,
her husband's $30 million yacht.
   Mason writes during regular, 9-to-5 office hours, but finds
pressure the best tonic for non-productivity.
   ``The idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it is
irresistible for writing new songs,'' he says.
   Some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains.
   For the reopening of Blair House in Washington, Mason wrote a
song about it on a cocktail napkin, while he was flying from New
York to the nation's capital.
   And for his Algonquin engagement, Mason has written different
types of songs.
   ``God knows, not everybody is interested in society's
darlings,'' he says. ``So I've written a love song or two. As well
as one number about the former president called `The Reagans at
Home in Bel Air.'''
   Mason suddenly begins reciting:
   ``The Secret Service is awfully nervous
   ``They can't think what to do.
   ``They are meant to take care of the Reagans
   ``But the Reagans seem awfully blue.
   ``They are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk
   ``And the pressure's not fair.
   ``Though their friends bought them quite a swell house.
   ``It's no fun being the Reagans at home in Bel Air.''
   Mason also is working on a musical called ``How To Bag a
Billionaire,'' a look at today's version of what used to be called
golddiggers, those women who want to marry for money and not
necessarily love.
   ``I'm selfishly writing the whole thing, the book and songs, but
I won't be in it,'' he says.
   The show has been delayed while Mason completes his Algonquin
engagement, and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich and
the famous.
   ``I find myself now invited to all the big parties _ the
serious, social parties, which is a peculiar thing,'' Mason says.
``I spend time with these people. They must be aware that I am
watching them every second to see how they are behaving. Maybe
people think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable way
by having me around.''
