COMPOSER-CONDUCTOR JOHN GREEN DIES AT AGE 80 
</P>

<P>
Composer-conductor-pianist-music executive John Green, whose film work won him 
five Academy Awards and whose songs include "Body and Soul," "Out of Nowhere" 
and "I Cover the Waterfront," died at his Beverly Hills home Monday night, it 
was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Liberman, a family friend and publicist, said the diminutive, personable 
musician was 80 and had suffered a stroke two years ago. The official cause of 
death was listed as pulmonary edema, Liberman added. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who wrote his first hit, "Coquette," while he was still a senior at 
Harvard, was a dapper, confident and uncommonly articulate man whose trademark 
was the fresh carnation he wore in his lapel every day. He said the flower was 
to remind him of the beauty in the world and of his obligation to protect and 
extend it if he could. 
</P>
<P>
Long a fixture at Hollywood Bowl summer concerts, he was born to a wealthy and 
cultured New York family. His father was a banker and builder after whom the 
community of Greenhaven, Long Island, is named. 
</P>
<P>
Green began piano lessons at age 3 and loved them. When he was 12 he was taken 
to a party honoring George Gershwin, a friend of the family. The boy was asked 
to perform for the composer and, marching to the piano, played his own 
arrangement of one of Gershwin's songs. 
</P>
<P>
Gershwin was evidently impressed and Green became a Gershwin protege and 
lifelong friend. Green remembered, at 16, attending the premiere of "Rhapsody 
in Blue" in New York. "The bloody place blew up," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
In later years Green arranged much of Gershwin's music for movies and records, 
including a delightful album of vocals by Fred Astaire. One of Green's Oscars 
was for the scoring of "An American in Paris," based on Gershwin's music. Green 
also frequently performed Gershwin in concert. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Green wanted his son to go into Wall Street. Reluctantly but 
dutifully, Green rushed through the rigorous, progressive Horace Mann School 
and entered Harvard at 15, majoring in economics. 
</P>
<P>
But he was already deeply involved in music and spent the summer between his 
junior and senior years living in Cleveland and writing arrangements for the 
new Guy Lombardo orchestra. (One of his pals that summer was the young 
publicist for a Cleveland movie house named Lew R. Wasserman, who in subsequent 
years was Green's agent at MCA and eventually head of that giant entertainment 
company.) 
</P>
<P>
But Green's father remained unimpressed. "Son," his father told him, "you can 
be a good banker, a good lawyer or doctor and you'll be a proud, respected 
citizen in the community. But there is no bum in the world like an artist who 
is merely good, and I'm afraid as a musician you are merely good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Wall Street Job 
</P>
<P>
Green graduated from Harvard in 1928 at only 19. Despite the fact that his 
early song "Coquette" was the biggest sheet-music seller in the country, he 
bowed to his father's will and took a job on Wall Street. "I was a sissy to do 
it," he confessed years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
He used his music royalties to pay for visits to a psychiatrist. Then, after 
six months, he defied his father, quit his job and became a rehearsal pianist 
at the Paramount studio in Astoria, Long Island, for $50 a week. 
</P>
<P>
He was also writing songs, often partnered with lyricist Edward Heyman, a 
friend of friends, a wealthy young Midwesterner whose family had prospered in 
sausage casings. In 1931, they wrote a package of four songs for Gertrude 
Lawrence for $250. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them had to be a comedy number, one an up-tempo item, one a ballad, one 
a torch song. The torch song was 'Body and Soul,' " Green said not long ago. 
Did he know he was writing a classic? a reporter asked him. "I only knew I was 
writing for Gertie for Wednesday," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copyright Sold 
</P>
<P>
Green and Heyman had actually sold the copyrights to the singer. But when 
another singer, Libby Holman, asked permission to use the song in her own act, 
Lawrence generously gave the song back to Green and Heyman. As it turned out, 
the royalties from "Body and Soul" would have assured their lifetime solvency 
if nothing else had. A favorite with both singers and jazz instrumentalists, it 
is one of the most-recorded songs in the repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
During his Astoria stay with Paramount, Green did his first bit of 
movie-scoring, an arrangement of "You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me" for 
Maurice Chevalier. Green is also credited with the music for a forgotten 1930 
film called "The Sap from Syracuse." 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, Green conducted the house orchestra for the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz 
Hart musical "By Jupiter," and at the time his principal ambition was to write 
for the musical theater. He wrote show tunes for Jack Buchanan and other 
performers, but the one musical he wrote a few years later closed out of town, 
in Boston, and he did not try another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formed Dance Orchestra 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of William Paley of CBS, Green (who then was still Johnny 
rather than John) formed a dance orchestra. It opened the St. Regis roof, a 
posh new night club that opened after the repeal of Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
Green was also the orchestra leader on several coast-to-coast radio programs, 
including the Philip Morris Hour, the Packard Hour with Fred Astaire and the 
Jell-O Show. His sidemen on the early radio shows included Artie Shaw and Benny 
Goodman (in the same reed section), Tommy Dorsey and Bunny Berigan. 
</P>
<P>
Green and the orchestra starred in a memorable short, "Music Magic," in which 
trick photography reduced Green to a Tom Thumb miniature amid the full-sized 
band. The film is still occasionally shown on television. He remained an 
orchestra leader until 1939, when he gave it up to try his hand at the 
unsuccessful musical. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, Green left New York for Los Angeles. He did a season as musical 
director of the Jack Benny radio show, doubling as a comic foil specializing in 
dialects. He also began his major work as a film composer, initially at Metro 
Goldwyn Mayer, where he scored, among others, "Bathing Beauty," "Easter Parade" 
(for which he won an Oscar), "The Great Caruso," "Brigadoon" and "Raintree 
County." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MGM Musical Director 
</P>
<P>
For a decade, 1949-58, Green was musical director at MGM, an executive position 
in which he earned a reputation as a hard but fair taskmaster. He could imagine 
his father, Green said, whirling in his grave at the thought of his son being 
more than a musician at last. 
</P>
<P>
But Green chafed at overseeing the work of others. "I'm glad I had the guts to 
assign myself the music for 'Raintree County,' " he said in a Times interview 
in 1973. It was the film music of which he was proudest and was nominated for 
an Academy Award (one of 14 nominations in his career), but lost to Malcolm 
Arnold's score for "Bridge on the River Kwai." 
</P>
<P>
He left MGM for a similar role as musical director at Desilu and, after a brief 
stint, became a free lancer, winning two more Oscars for the musical direction 
of "West Side Story" in 1961 and "Oliver!" in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
His fifth Academy Award was as producer of an MGM musical short based on "The 
Merry Wives of Windsor Overture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guest Conductor 
</P>
<P>
Green recalled seeing his first performance at the Hollywood Bowl in 1921, a 
concert version of "Carmen." He returned to the Bowl as a guest artist in 1945. 
Then in 1949, he began a series of appearances as a guest conductor of pops 
concerts that lasted without interruption until 1966, when he was away in 
London for two years working on "Oliver!" 
</P>
<P>
During this period Green also conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic's 
Promenade concerts of light classics (1959-63). He continued to conduct at the 
Bowl for several years after his return from London, making his 32nd appearance 
in the summer of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In later years, he appeared as conductor and pianist with several symphony 
orchestras across the country. His one-movement symphony, "Mine Eyes Have 
Seen," was commissioned by the Denver Symphony and performed at the dedication 
of its Boettcher Concert Hall in 1978. In June, 1988, in conjunction with the 
60th reunion of his Harvard class, Green conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed Name 
</P>
<P>
As he moved out of song-writing into more serious conducting, he was persuaded 
that "Johnny" was insufficiently dignified and he became John Green, although 
he remained Johnny to old acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
He was a four-term director of the American Society of Composers, Authors and 
Publishers and had been active as a fund-raiser and mentor for the Young 
Musicians Foundation, among several other organizations. He was a longtime vice 
president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and chairman of 
its music branch. He conducted the Academy Award presentations 10 times. 
Pepperdine University gave him an honorary degree in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Green was married three times. His first was to debutante Carol Koshland when 
he was 20. By his second wife, television consumerist Betty Furness, he had a 
daughter, Barbara, an actress in Los Angeles. In 1943, he married Bonnie 
Waters, a statuesque actress who was under contract at MGM. She survives him 
along with their two daughters, Kathy, a composer-performer who lives in New 
York, and Christopher Allyson (Kim) Green-Meglio of Los Angeles. Four 
grandchildren also survive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attended Luncheon 
</P>
<P>
Although he had suffered a stroke in October, 1987, and had been in failing 
health since then, he attended a luncheon in his honor given by the Pacific 
Pioneer Broadcasters last September when he was saluted by fellow film 
composers Henry Mancini, John Williams and Arthur Hamilton, among others. 
</P>
<P>
In what turned out to be his last public tribute, the Beverly Hills Pops 
Orchestra gave a concert in Green's honor on his 80th birthday, last Oct. 10 
with Bill Conti conducting and songs performed by Dinah Shore, Tony Martin, 
Rosemary Clooney and Carol Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
He had remained active until a few days before his death, producing as recently 
as last Sunday the annual gala for the John Douglas French Foundation for 
Alzheimer's Disease, of which he was a founder. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the foundation said that although confined to a wheelchair, he 
had lined up the talent for the fund-raiser and "did everything but conduct the 
orchestra," as he usually did. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Green said there will be a private celebration of her husband's life on 
Monday. In lieu of flowers, donations are asked to the French Foundation, 11620 
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles 90025 or to the Bel-Air Presbyterian Church, where 
a new organ will bear his name.
