   Little Casey Schlitz, whose dad is a
songwriter, had just learned the Lord's Prayer and got into the
habit of saying ``forever and ever, amen'' at the end of everything
he said.
   Schlitz and a hot singer-songwriter named Paul Overstreet
started tinkering with what the 4-year-old said and turned it into
the 1988 Grammy-winner ``Forever and Ever, Amen,'' which was
recorded by country star Randy Travis and became one of the biggest
hits in recent years.
   ``We started monkeying around with it, and before you knew it,
it started being fun,'' Overstreet recalled. ``It was done in an
hour and a half or so, and we had an idea who should sing it.
   ``It was a unique way to say something at that time, but it
didn't give me chills the first time I heard it. A lot of the
success was due to Randy Travis' popularity at the time.''
   Overstreet was surprised to win a Grammy for the song.
   ``I don't think it's sunk in yet to be recognized with the `big
boys.' That's the big leagues there. Being a country boy from down
in Mississippi and going to New York (for the Grammy show), it was
pretty neat. It was an opportunity you don't get every day.''
   Sixteen years ago, Overstreet, who was born in Newton, Miss.,
and raised in Vancleave, arrived in Nashville without a job and
homeless. He slept in an empty church until he could find work as a
welder. Then he finally broke into the music business, writing and
singing. In the past three years, he's probably been the top
songwriter in country music.
   He wrote ``On the Other Hand,'' also recorded by Travis, which
was voted song of the year in 1987 by both the Country Music
Association and the Academy of Country Music. And he wrote or
co-wrote a string of other country hits: ``Diggin' Up Bones'' and
``Deeper Than the Holler,'' both recorded by Travis; ``When You Say
Nothing at All,'' recorded by the late Keith Whitley; ``Same Ole
Me,'' by George Jones; ``You're Still New to Me,'' by Marie Osmond
and Paul Davis; ``One Love at a Time,'' by Tanya Tucker; and ``I
Fell in Love Last Night,'' by the Forester Sisters.
   As a recording artist, his debut RCA album ``Sowin' Love'' has
produced two hit singles this year: the title cut plus ``Love Helps
Those.''
   The 34-year-old Overstreet has also tackled an alcohol and drug
problem, and says he's found an inner peace after quitting
substances four years ago. That's when his songwriting career also
blossomed.
   ``I'm in a real peaceful place with myself right now,'' he said.
``I still expect quite a bit from myself, but I feel I'm in the
right place on the right road and I'll progress as time goes on.
This is the first time in my life I can actually say I'm on the
right road. I feel I'm building in the right direction.''
   He used cocaine and developed a reputation as one of the biggest
boozers in music industry hangouts. ``I drank 'til it was over,''
he recalled. ``It was a miserable time.
   ``I definitely was wasting my talent. I didn't finish songs. I
didn't have the energy to work. I was operating at 25 to 50 percent
of my capabilities on an average.''
   In his songwriting, he tries to convey positive messages and
talk about life's potentials.
   ``I've tried to say things in songs to encourage people rather
than take advantage of weaknesses,'' Overstreet said. ``I try to
see things that would help people see how things could be.
   ``I try to sew a lot of that into the songs. It's a real
complicated process. I'll think of something in a way I've never
looked at it before. Then I can formulate the two ends together
with the chorus in the middle.
   ``I try to paint the picture, set the story I'm developing
around the idea. At that point, the lyrics and music kind of come
together.''
   And that's how ``Forever and Ever, Amen'' happened.
   A memorable line from the song is ``as long as old men sit and
talk about the weather, as long as old women sit and talk about old
men.''
   ``That's pretty plain,'' Overstreet said. ``It's real. It hit
the heart of a lot of people.''
