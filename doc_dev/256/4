   Oscar-winning composer Sammy Fain, whose
classic love ballads included ``Love is a Many Splendored Thing''
and ``I'll be Seeing You,'' has died of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Fain, who was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won two, died
Wednesday at the UCLA Medical Center, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of America's most memorable
pop hits.
   Many Fain titles bring instant recognition: ``Secret Love,''
``Let A Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up
That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night'' among them.
   `` `I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
ASCAP President Morton Gould said of the World War II song. ``It's
hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He was such a
sweet person, such a gentle person.''
   Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator, said his
friend leaves ``not just a few but a staggering medley of hits,
songs that are readily identifiable to everyone.''
   He added: ``You know, old songwriters never really die because
their songs keep them alive forever.''
   Fain's collaborators included lyricists Cahn, Irving Kahal, Bob
Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis Webster, Mitchell
Parish, E.Y. Harburg, and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said Parish in a telephone interview from New
York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets.
   ``Workmen, whatever they were doing, would be singing strains of
our songs ... That explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain won Oscars for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love Is
a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from the
Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York on June 17, 1902, Fain was a
piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows What A Red-Headed
Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash 1938 review
``Hellzapoppin.''
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that year, ``I'll Be Seeing
You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime classics.
The latter was recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York.
