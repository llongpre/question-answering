   The 16 musicals created by George and Ira
Gershwin between 1921 and 1933 were not written for posterity. They
only had a life expectancy of their original Broadway runs.
   When these shows closed after six months or sometimes a year, no
one ever bothered to preserve all the material from them. Hit songs
such as ``The Man I Love,'' ``I Got Rhythm,'' ``Someone To Watch
over Me,'' ``S'Wonderful'' and others survived, but the musicals
they were from often did not.
   There wasn't the sense that anyone would want to hear - some 50
or 60 years later - the entire score from ``Girl Crazy,'' ``Strike
Up the Band,'' ``Treasure Girl,'' ``Funny Face,'' ``Lady, Be
Good!'' and ``Tip-Toes.''
   With the advent of the cast album in 1943 that changed.
Audiences found a way to keep alive their memories of original
performances. But George and Ira Gershwin had written their last
Broadway show nearly a decade earlier.
   Now a major recording project is under way to document all the
Gershwin theater works, including the shows lyricist Ira Gershwin
wrote with other composers, such as Kurt Weill, Vernon Duke and
Arthur Schwartz. The recordings will use scores carefully
reconstructed from original manuscripts.
   The comprehensive effort has been financed by Leonore Gershwin,
Ira's widow. Mrs. Gershwin, now 90, formed Roxbury Recordings,
named after the stately drive in Beverly Hills where the couple
lived and where she still lives.
   ``She has taken it as a mission in life to make sure that the
works of her husband and his brother are preserved in the best
possible way,'' says Michael Strunsky, Mrs. Gershwin's nephew who
represents her on the project. ``My aunt wants people forever to
hear what George and Ira really wrote, at a quality level they
would be proud of.''
   The company's first effort, released in December on Electra
Nonesuch Records and done in collaboration with the Library of
Congress, is ``Girl Crazy,'' a 1930 Gershwin musical trifle
fashioned for Willie Howard, a big musical comedy star of the day.
The original show also featured two teen-agers, one named Ethel
Merman and the other Ginger Rogers.
   The new release, the first complete recording of the show, stars
Lorna Luft in the Merman role, Judy Blazer singing Rogers' part,
David Carroll and Frank Gorshin.
   ``In a sense, we are the show's original cast album,'' says
Luft, who had the daunting task of singing ``I Got Rhythm'' and
``Boy! What Love Has Done to Me!'' - two songs closely associated
with Merman throughout her career.
   ``There were no modern interpretations on the recording,'' Luft
says. ``There is a tendency, of course, with songs like `I Got
Rhythm' to use a more up-to-date vocal style. I had to not use it
at all.''
   ``You want to exude a sense of fun with this music,'' says John
Mauceri, conductor of the new recording and a champion of restoring
old Broadway musicals for stage and record. ``It should be quite
contagious.
   ``Sometimes you'll hear a recent recording of an old show, and
it sounds like an adult education course. And then when you listen
to the original performers on old 78 records, you smile. One of the
things I wanted to make sure was present in this music was its
smile. `Girl Crazy' is one of the happiest scores George and Ira
ever wrote.''
   Listen to modern versions of ``I Got Rhythm,'' Mauceri says.
Most singers seem to get the rhythm wrong.
   ``If you're doing it right, it's very entertaining,'' he says.
``The orchestrations and the arrangements really only work when you
sing them in the right style.''
   The problem is that most of those original orchestrations have
long disappeared. Research was required to put the shows back into
their original state.
   Restoration work on ``Girl Crazy'' was supervised by Tommy
Krasker, producer of the recording series and archivist for the
Gershwin estate. His task, which took about six months, was made
easier because much of the show's original material, including
orchestrations, was available.
   Krasker was not so lucky with ``Strike Up the Band,'' the second
show in the project, which was recorded in early December with
Mauceri again conducting. An extensive research effort had to be
undertaken.
   At the Gershwin home in California, Krasker pored over musical
manuscripts, lyric sheets and scrapbooks about the show. He scoured
old reviews and other newspaper articles, listened to period
recordings and studied photographs.
   ``Strike Up the Band,'' which originally had a book by George S.
Kaufman, was one of the Gershwins' most interesting failures - and
successes. A 1927 version of the show closed in Philadelphia and
never made it to New York. A revised version became a hit three
years later. Roxbury has recorded both versions and will release
them next summer.
   The first version of ``Strike Up the Band'' was a dark comedy,
an anti-war piece about the United States going to war with
Swizterland to protest a tariff on Swiss cheese. The second, with a
revised book by Morris Ryskind, softened the anti-war tone, turning
the war into a dream sequence and the fight over cheese into a
battle over chocolate.
   ```Strike Up the Band' certainly was ground-breaking in terms of
subject matter, characterization, integration of script and
score,'' Krasker says.
   The problem was that outside of piano-vocal material and lyric
sheets, not much of the original remained. Out of some 40 songs in
the two versions of the show, Krasker found orchestrations for only
six.
   What he did was hire six of the theater's most accomplished
orchestrators - Sid Ramin, Bill Brohn, Dick Hyman, Russell Warner,
Larry Wilcox and Ralph Burns - to write orchestrations in the style
of the period.
   All the lyrics for ``Strike Up the Band'' were found, and only
one piece of music - the verse to a song called ``Meadow Serenade''
- was missing. Its refrain had been remembered by Kay Swift, a
composer and good friend of George Gershwin.
   Krasker asked Burton Lane, composer of ``Finian's Rainbow'' and
a one-time collaborator of Ira Gershwin, to write a new verse.
   ``A few days after I handed him the lyric, he came in with a
tune that was absolutely wonderful,'' he says. ``It feels like it
was all written in one stroke. Burton's verse and George's refrain
complement each other beautifully. I have to think it's going to be
one of the highlights of the recording.''
