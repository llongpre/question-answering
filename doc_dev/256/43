   Otis Blackwell stumbled into a
songwriting career and ended up composing hit records that have sold
a remarkable 185 million copies.
   In more than 30 years of writing, he says he's used no guidelines
in turning out such rock 'n' roll hits as ``Handy Man,'' ``Don't Be
Cruel,'' ``Return to Sender'' and ``All Shook Up.''
   ``I wrote, went home and prayed,'' he said about his early years
as a songwriter when he composed several hit records for Elvis
Presley and ``Great Balls of Fire'' and ``Breathless'' for Jerry Lee
Lewis.
   He's written more than 1,000 songs that have been recorded by
performers such as Billy Joel, James Taylor, Ray Charles, the Who,
Otis Redding, Peggy Lee and dozens of others in addition to Presley
and Lewis.
   ``It makes me feel wonderful for other people to do my songs and
have them still be around and have people still wanting to do
them,'' Blackwell says, reflecting on a composing career few can
match.
   His favorite?
   ``I don't know. I have fun with all of them.''
   The 56-year-old Blackwell was a poor kid from Brooklyn, N.Y., who
wanted to be a singer. He worked as a young man as a floor sweeper
at a Brooklyn theater and later as a clothes presser. While
recording tunes for a small New York company, he was asked to write
songs as well.
   ``I was thrown into it,'' he says about songwriting.
   His songs in the years since have sold 185 million copies, with
Presley's ``Don't Be Cruel'' one of his first hits. Cheap Trick
recently had another hit version.
   ``I guess the style was different,'' he says about Presley's
version. ``Elvis came out with it and it was new and he was new.''
   About the Cheap Trick version, he says, ``I loved it. It was done
close to the way it was done the first time. I was surprised it was
so close. The performance they did was superb.''
   Another big seller was ``Handy Man,'' a hit most recently for
Taylor but a song written and recorded years earlier. ``It was out a
few weeks before I heard it,'' Blackwell says. ``I didn't even know
who James Taylor was. It was a little different. I had no idea it
would catch on the way it did.''
   He wrote ``Return to Sender'' hoping it would be included in a
movie Presley would make.
   ``It wasn't the same type of shuffle songs we used to do,''
Blackwell recalled. ``I really didn't think he would accept it. It
was different compared to the type songs we had been pitching at
him.''
   Blackwell often sang the songs himself before they were recorded,
and some music historians believe his style influenced Presley's.
   ``I don't know except that we both sound alike,'' Blackwell says.
``I used to do quite a few demos (demonstration versions) of songs I
didn't write ... songs that were his style. It was easy writing for
him. When I would do these things, I would figure this is me singing
and this is the way he would sing them. So it came real easy.''
   He never met Presley and feels his relationship with him was best
kept at a distance: ``We hadecord company and may put a band
together and perform the songs he's written.
   ``I enjoy singing the songs I've written because the people I
perform for know the songs and like to sing along with me,'' he says.
   He offers few suggestions for writing songs.
   ``What I find out is you've just got to get up and whatever
comes, I just throw the book away, whatever that is. I don't have
any guidelines. I try to write simple lyrics. I try to write clear
lyrics. My lyrics must be simple and can be sung by kids 5-years-old
on up. I just try to figure out something not done before.
   ``I made a lot of money and still do,'' he said. ``I've spent a
lot foolishly. I had my problems with the big house and big car and
the good times and the government and I guess I had an alcohol
problem at one time.
   ``The wealth I have is knowing that my songs are still being done
and I've helped a lot of writers whenever possible.''
