   Give Kenny Loggins a movie and he'll give you a
hit tune.
   Since splitting with partner Jim Messina in 1976 so both could
pursue solo careers, Loggins has found success in songs for movies.
   He's touted by Columbia Records publicity as ``the only male
solo artist to have achieved three Top 10 singles from three
different films.''
   The songs are ``I'm Alright'' from ``Caddyshack'' in 1980; the
title song of ``Footloose'' in 1984; and ``Danger Zone'' from ``Top
Gun'' in 1986.
   His new single, ``Nobody's Fool,'' from ``Caddyshack II,'' is in
the Top 40 and heading toward becoming his fourth Top 10 from a
film. Loggins' new album, ``Back to Avalon'' is his first in three
years.
   Loggins talked about his new album and career in an interview
before beginning an American tour which will keep him on the road
through Oct. 9.
   Here are highlights of that interview.
   Q. Why is ``Back to Avalon'' your first solo album in three
years?
   A. I was asking myself that the other day. I guess time just
sort of swept by. I wrote and recorded more songs for this album
than the 10 or 11 I normally do. I recorded 16 or 17.
   I had a third child, a little girl, 8 months old, whose brothers
are 7 and 6. We've been building a home in Santa Barbara (Calif.).
For those who've built homes, they know that can be consuming.
   And during that period I had two soundtrack songs, ``Meet Me
Half Way'' in ``Over the Top'' and ``Danger Zone'' in ``Top Gun.''
   Q. Is ``Back to Avalon'' about Catalina Island?
   A. No. Avalon's a mythical place which has to do with King
Arthur's Court. The song isn't about King Arthur's Court. It's
about a relationship that has been together awhile and started to
drift apart. The singer refers to the way love used to be as
Avalon. They've got one last try to regain that feel of Avalon.
   Q. Do they?
   A. I have no idea. It's as if it was a scene of a movie. You
only get to see the one scene; you don't get to see the resolution.
   Quite often I get a visual idea and what I try to do is describe
the scene and the emotion behind the scene, which is probably why I
enjoy doing the soundtrack thing so much. They deliver up a scene
for me and I try to find the emotion behind the scene and write the
song to it.
   Q. Have you always written that way?
   A. Yes. There's always a moment in time that you freeze and you
try to describe best that single emotion in that single moment.
   Q. What has been your most successful ``emotion behind a scene''
song?
   A. Possibly ``Forever,'' a hit of mine a couple of years ago. Or
``Back to Avalon.'' I like to think my writing gets better as I get
older.
   Q. Are there disadvantages to being identified with movie songs?
   A. I don't think there is any stigma to singing movie songs. The
only thing I would worry about would be that radio would say,
``We're not going to play this any more.'' So far they're behind
me. That's all that matters. I figure as long as it's a good song
they'll play it.
   I don't think I've compromised my writing to do it. I've been
very fortunate that I've had such luck with it.
   Q. Can a hit song only come from a hit movie?
   A. I had a hit record, ``Meet Me Half Way,'' from a dog movie,
Sly Stallone's ``Over the Top.''
   Q. Have you had any movie songs that didn't work out?
   A. I told the two guys doing ``Flashdance'' that I didn't have
time to write and record for it; I was on the road. Within a few
days of being on the road I fell off a stage in Utah and broke a
couple of ribs. I was sent home. During the recuperation, I tried
to put together a song for ``Flashdance.'' They liked it. I felt it
wasn't good enough and I pulled it, not realizing the movie was
going to be one of the biggest summer movies in history.
   Q. Does your success with movie songs bring you lots of offers?
   A. I expected, once you had a few hits, they'd come looking for
you. But for the most part you have to search them out. When I hear
about a project that has got a buzz on it, I'll have my manager
make some calls and see if they're interested in music and if I can
get in to see a screening.
   Q. How did you start with movie songs?
   A. I wrote ``I Believe in Love,'' which Barbra Streisand sang in
``A Star Is Born,'' and met Jon Peters (Streisand's former
companion), who was producing. Jon called me for ``Caddyshack.''
They needed a theme song. I watched a rough cut, laughed a lot and
wanted to be a part of it. Within a couple of days I'd written
``I'm Alright.''
   But I wasn't so sure when he called about ``Caddyshack II.'' I
was a little skittish about trusting lightning to strike twice in
the same place.
   Q. Have you written all the movie songs you've recorded?
   A. ``Danger Zone'' and ``Meet Me Half Way'' were both written by
Georgio Moroder. The ``Footloose'' script was written by a friend
of mine, lyricist Dean Pitchford. We wrote ``Footloose'' and ``I'm
Free'' together, which were in the movie. He went on to collaborate
on all the songs in the movie.
   Q. What were your thoughts when you turned 40 this year?
   A. You mean about suicide? I was a little depressed for a few
days. When you're in rock 'n' roll you don't expect to turn 40.
