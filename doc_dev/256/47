   When the punk rock band ``Old Skull'' began
performing at local clubs, J.P. Toulon's hands were only big enough
to play three chords on the guitar, and the group got paid with
McDonald's happy meals.
   Today, the three prepubescent punksters have a music video on
MTV for their debut LP, ``Get Outta School,'' and practice in
J.P.'s basement on high-tech equipment donated by sponsors. They
even were paid $1,000 for a 30-minute performance in New York.
   ``Old Skull'' _ guitarist J.P. Toulon, 10; his brother, bass
player Jamie, 9, and drummer Jesse Collins-Davies, 10 _ has been
together for three years. The trio is managed by J.P.'s father,
Vern. ``Get Outta School,'' which was recorded more than a year ago
and released last spring, has sold about 30,000 copies.
   ``People will buy your first album because you're young and new
and they think, `Oh, how cute,''' said Jesse, a fifth-grader. ``But
now they want to hear real music and that's what we're trying to
do. Our last record _ we just played anything.''
   On the first album, the band sings, and screams, about such
issues as the homeless and AIDS. In ``Homeless,'' J.P. howls into
the microphone amid screeching guitars and bashing drums.
   ``I hate you Ronald Reagan!'' he shouts at the end, with a look
in his eye that tells you he means it.
   ``Reagan's out, dude,'' Robin Davies, Jesse's father, said at a
recent after-school practice.
   ``I know,'' J.P. responded. ``I still hate him.''
   The band performs fun, silly songs, too.
   ``Hotdog Hell'' gives the audience more than just music for slam
dancing, a popular form of dancing for punk rock enthusiasts.
   ``It's usually our last song,'' said Jamie, a fourth-grader.
``We throw hot dogs into the crowd. It's funny. Then they throw
them back at us and we fight back _ we throw them back again.''
   But the band has gained more popularity on the East and West
coasts than at home in Madison, Davies said. ``On the coasts they
tend to get caught up in the media like L.A. and New York. In
Madison, they don't get caught up in it, which is good, actually,
for the kids. In Madison they're more grounded.''
   The band has received more than 400 fan letters from around the
world, including one from a boy in Greece.
   Both fathers, who also are musicians, insist their children are
treated just like other students at school and have not been
changed by their success.
   ``I know it's crazy, but things are absolutely the same,''
Toulon said. ``If anything, they're sick of it (media attention).
There's been no grown heads.''
   Amid school, soccer, karate and skateboarding, the boys practice
weekly and travel about one weekend a month to Minneapolis,
Milwaukee, Chicago and other nearby cities. They usually play in
bars or nightclubs. The band will make its first international
appearance when the boys, along with their parents, go to Japan to
appear on an audience-participation television show Dec. 8.
   Despite some criticism for allowing their children to play in a
punk band, the fathers said they believe ``Old Skull'' is a
positive aspect in their sons' lives.
   ``It's really opened a lot of doors for J.P.,'' Toulon said.
Although he's never acted before, J.P. has auditioned for the lead
role in ``Motorama,'' an action film from the producers of
``Platoon.''
   J.P. and Jesse also write most of the band's songs.
   ``We write about what we see and feel,'' Jesse said. ``We write
about what we think is important.''
   ``We're trying to be more serious than we are,'' said J.P., a
fifth-grader. ``But it's hard, because we're only kids.''
   What timely topics can we expect ``Old Skull'' to be shrieking
criticism at on the next album?
   ``I wrote a song about the stealth bomber,'' Jesse said. ``It's
called Money Waste.''
