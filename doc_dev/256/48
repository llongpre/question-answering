   You think you know your favorite Beatles songs,
right? But can you remember all the lyrics, and can you get all the
correct words in the correct places? Psychologists want to know.
   For example, in the song ``Rocky Raccoon,'' what comes after the
opening line: ``Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of
Dakota''? (Answer: The second line is, ``There lived a young boy
named Rocky Raccoon.'')
   Researchers asked 76 Duke University students to recall and
write down all the words to 32 Beatles songs. They were given only
the title and the first line of each.
   The purpose was to gain insight into how the mind remembers, say
researchers David Rubin of Duke and Ira Hyman of Emory University
in Atlanta.
   Half the students were assigned one group of 32 randomly chosen
songs; the others were given a different group of 32 tunes.
   Researchers analyzed the students' performance on the 25
best-remembered songs. Multiplying the number of lines in those
songs times the 38 students assigned each song gave a maximum
possible score of 16,416 recollections.
   The students achieved only 3,378 with any degree of accuracy.
   But the interesting thing, Hyman said Sunday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association, is that recall
for details of the lines they remembered was remarkably good.
   Of the 3,378 lines students wrote down, they recalled 2,371
without error, 454 more with only one error and 227 with only two
errors.
   And even the flawed lines generally followed the meaning, rhythm
and poetic features of the original, suggesting people use those
characteristics to recall such material, Hyman said.
   For example, rhythm and rhyme were preserved in such errors as
remembering the phrase ``and you know you should be glad'' as ``and
you know you can't be sad,'' from the hit ``She Loves You.''
   Only four of 32 students in one group remembered that Rocky
Raccoon was carrying a gun to ``shoot off the legs of his rival.''
But some guesses were close, such as to shoot off the head or hands
or ``shoot out the lights'' of the man who stole his woman.
   Rhyming words at the end of lines were well recalled, but
sometimes there was some unintentional editing. One student turned
``wonder how you manage to feed the rest'' from ``Lady Madonna''
into ``wonder how you manage to be caressed.''
   Sometimes a flubbed phrase didn't even rhyme with the original.
``Having read the book'' from the song ``A Day in the Life'' became
``having read the play'' in one student's version.
   Other errors kept the same sounds within lines, as when the
phrase ``always know sometimes think it's me,'' from ``Strawberry
Fields Forever,'' became ``always though sometimes think it's
free.''
   In another case, from ``Yesterday,'' the line ``I said something
wrong now I long for yesterday'' became ``I must move along but I
long for yesterday.''
   And as for the student who wrote ``for efficient finger pies''
while trying to recall ``a four of fish and finger pies'' from the
song ``Penny Lane,'' maybe he just never heard it right in the
first place.
