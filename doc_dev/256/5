<TEXT>     Mrs. Kaye, the widow of actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for
many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man"
(1945), "The Kid From Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"
(1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).;   A
native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied
music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in
Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman
and Danny Kaye.;   There she began writing specialty material, including a
Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Danny Kaye. In 1940,
the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue.";
  That year, she married Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La
Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for
her husband and accompanied him on piano.;   Mrs. Kaye was known for her
complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter
songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines.;   Most frequently
cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three
Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But
Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization.;   "I wrote many songs for
Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but
only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The
Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on
Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect
love song.";   For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely
for her husband. She once estimated she wrote more than 100 songs for him
during their 40-year collaboration. She also was involved in the production of
almost all his films. She was nominated twice for Academy Awards, for her work
on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953).;   In the 1970s,
she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She
began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971
and at Yale University in 1975.;   In 1979, she produced and narrated the
course as a 90-minute Public Broadcasting Service program, "Musical Comedy
Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975, she was executive producer for a
television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and
edited "Assignment Children," a UNICEF film that starred her husband.;   In
the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book
about her life with Danny Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She
also was writing a catalog of show-business material that she and her husband
had donated to the Library of Congress.;   Brooklyn College awarded her an
honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia
Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of
the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.;   Danny Kaye died in 1987 at the
age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television
journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.  </TEXT>
