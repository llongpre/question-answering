   Combine a mail deliverer, a dishwasher, a tour
guide and a certified driller of bowling balls and you have
``Katrina and the Waves,'' not the average rock 'n' roll band.
   Take the name, for instance. Former postal worker Kimberly Rew
is the acknowledged leader, the band's principal writer and
arranger. So who gets top billing? Singer and ex-dishwasher Katrina
Leskanich, of course.
   ``At first Kimberly was doing the singing and the group was
called `The Waves,''' explained drummer Alex Cooper, the band's
one-time tour guide. ``But once Katrina started singing, we became
`Katrina and the Waves.' Someone said we'd get more dates at the
military camps because the soldiers will come out for a girl's
name.''
   Military camps are important because both Cooper and Leskanich
grew up in military families that traveled all over the world.
Leskanich alone has lived in England, Germany, the Netherlands,
Nebraska, Massachusetts, California, Georgia and Kansas.
   The group's first live performances were at military bases,
before crowds that responded to a singer called Katrina.
   ``We used to play on these horrible naval bases up in Scotland
where these guys had in been submarines for six months and I was
the first female they'd seen,'' Leskanich said.
   ``They'd go absolutely wild, they were up to here in liquor.
They'd pull down their pants right on the dance floor. We just
collapsed laughing, it was all a joke. We're trying to do our
number and it was just ridiculous.''
   In 1981, Rew wrote ``Walking on Sunshine,'' a good old-fashioned
rock 'n' roll summer song _ bouncy melody, memorable guitar riffs
and Katrina's joyous vocals on top. It sounded like a sure hit, and
was: four years later.
   ``We took it around to all the stations and all the companies,
and nothing happened,'' Cooper said. ``Then we were signed at the
end of '84 to Capitol and at the end of '85 they put it out, pow! A
classic! It was released at the right time, just one of those
things.''
   After finally cracking the charts, Katrina and the Waves could
be expected to get right to work on a new album. They did, but the
record didn't come out until recently.
   ``We thought we had finished the record,'' Cooper said. ``But we
took it back home and listened to it, and said: `Oh dear. I think
we'll start again.' We did that twice.''
   The Waves consider their group a democracy; whoever shouts
loudest wins. Nothing is considered finished until everyone is
satisfied, and with four very distinct personalities, that can take
time.
   ``Alex is dad. I'd sit home all the time if I could. `C'mon,'
he'll say, `let's get on the bus,''' said bassist and bowling ball
surgeon Vince de la Cruz. ``Kim is the mad professor. Katrina is
chief brat. I just try to do as little as possible.''
   The band agrees that Katrina's voice and Kimberly's guitar and
songwriting are the key to their sound. But since Katrina won't
sing anything that doesn't feel right, ``creative differences'' can
emerge.
   ``Kim's songs are brilliant and he's still going to write songs
on his own that the band's not going to touch,'' Katrina said.
``But he's trying to write songs from my point of view and
sometimes I didn't agree.''
   She cited ``Crush on You,'' a ballad off the new album.
   ``At first, I thought it was a little too boy-meets-girl. That's
a good example of one of Kim's `boy-meets-girl' songs I tried to
change but when I did, it lost the innocence.
   ``I have to sing a song from my point of view. I feel it's going
to be believed. But when you are trying to write from someone
else's point of view, you start getting into cliches.''
   While all due admiration for Rew, the fellow Waves have started
contributing their own material.
   Katrina and Kim co-wrote ``To Have and to Hold'' and ``Love
Calculator.'' Kim and Alex share credits on ``Rock Myself to
Sleep,'' and the whole band contributed to ``Chain Lover,'' ``Rock
'n' Roll Girls'' and the hit single ``Break of Hearts.''
   ``We've only started doing that in the last six months,'' Cooper
said. ``Kimberly tended to always just come to us with songs, but
he suggested himself after about eight years that we should
contribute. It's taken us eight years to get confident enough to
work on our own ideas.''
   Sharing material has helped keep the band together; so has
separating their private lives.
   ``You live a very tense existence,'' Cooper said, ``but we all
have interests outside the band that are not musical and not
similar to each other's interests.
   ``Kimberly's happy to be working 24 hours a day, seven days a
week on music. It's a complete obsession. We love music, too, but
not with that kind of intensity.''
