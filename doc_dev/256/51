   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Over the past two decades he has written some of
America's most popular songs, starting with ``Up, Up and Away'' in
1967. But Jimmy Webb has not been able to get off the ground on
Broadway, even while working with some of the top names in the
theater. He's still trying, with three productions in the works.

   Ace songwriter Jimmy Webb, who has returned to
performing, is still trying to crack Broadway after several
frustrating years of trying.
   ``So many of these things, you can work on them for years and
you don't get to see anything,'' he says. ``Someone told me it took
eight years to get `Annie' on Broadway. It's a tough business.''
   Webb is also not forgetting the record market, his bread and
butter. He alternates, writing one song for records, one for a
Broadway show.
   ``Nobody pays anybody to write Broadway shows,'' he says.
``There's nothing up front. And I think it's dangerous to work 15
months on a musical and not write one song for the record market.
Record people say, `Is he still alive?'''
   After 1967, when his ``Up, Up and Away'' became the first big
hit for the Fifth Dimension and his ``By the Time I Get to
Phoenix'' put Glen Campbell on the charts, Webb concentrated on the
record market. Campbell scored again with Webb's ``Wichita
Lineman'' and ``Galveston.'' Actor Richard Harris had record hits
with Webb's ``MacArthur Park'' and ``Didn't We?''.
   But in the 1980s, Webb has concentrated on writing for Broadway.
Three productions are planned for next season _ on Broadway,
off-Broadway and in Dublin, Ireland.
   So far, nothing Webb has written has been performed on Broadway.
The shows he worked on, with some of the top names in the theater,
never opened.
   Webb composes in a studio in a Manhattan building that was owned
by the late Michael Bennett, the master director of ``A Chorus
Line'' and ``Dreamgirls.''
   ``The first musical I did with Michael, `Scandal,' I spent 14
months in this room writing, almost every day,'' Webb recalls. To
no avail. .
   ``I got kind of uncomfortable with that. I feel I have to get
back to these individual songs. But they're harder. I think it's
easier to write songs when you know the plot than sitting down with
a blank piece of paper and going, `Let's write a hit, here.'''
   Webb accomplished the latter this winter with ``Still Within the
Sound of My Voice,'' Glen Campbell's first hit record in 10 years.
It was Campbell, a friend for 20 years, who in 1985 suggested
Webb's four-verse ``The Highwayman'' to Waylon Jennings, Willie
Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson.
   At 41, Webb also is singing in cabarets, accompanying himself on
the piano. During January and February he performed at Jan
Wallman's and the Ballroom in New York and at the Hollywood
Roosevelt Hotel's ``Cinegrill.''
   ``I'm just not ready to pack it up yet,'' Webb says.
   He performed with a rock band in the early 1970s, but stopped
after a second tour as opening act for the group America. He made
six record albums in the 1970s but none sold exceptionally well.
   Amy Grant sings Webb's ``If These Walls Could Speak'' on her
next album. Webb co-wrote ``Home of the Brave'' with David Paich of
Toto for that group's new album. ``His father, Marty Paich,
arranged `Up, Up and Away.''' Webb says. David was about 12 then.
   In 1980, Webb moved to Tuxedo Park, N.Y., and began writing
``Tuxedo,'' a show based on the history of the once-fashionable
suburb of New York City where the dinner jacket that bears its name
was introduced. ``I was wasting time,'' Webb says. ``I knew nothing
about what I was doing.''
   Then recording mogul David Geffen introduced Webb to Michael
Bennett and Webb started working on ``Scandal.''
   But Bennett announced the postponement of ``Scandal'' two weeks
before scheduled rehearsals in Broadway's Mark Hellinger Theater.
   ``We call it black Monday,'' Webb recalls. ``We had Treat
Williams and Swoosie Kurtz and most of the great dancers and
singers from the original `Chorus Line' and some others from
`Dreamgirls.'''
   Webb says that Bennett probably decided the times were not right
for a show about infidelity.
   Next they started working on another musical together called
``Children's Crusade.''
   ``There was a mass uprising of children in France and Germany,
twice, 40 years apart in the 13th century. Huge groups of children
left their homes and banded together and declared their intention
to go to the Holy Land. And did it. People would ask where they
were going. They'd say they were going to heaven, to see Jesus.
There were hundreds of thousands of them, white-robed children
carrying little wooden crosses with this light in their eyes.
   ``One of the last conversations I ever had with Michael, he
wanted me to go ahead with it. He still thought it was the best
idea he'd ever had for a Broadway show.''
   Webb hopes it'll arrive on Broadway next season.
   Last summer Webb wrote the music and he and Ray Bradbury
collaborated on lyrics for a musical, based on Bradbury's novel,
``Dandelion Wine.'' It's planned for off-Broadway next season.
   ``It's about learning as an adult to face yourself as a child,''
Webb says. ``That way you find out a lot about why you are the way
you are and maybe you can become happier with yourself.
   ``Ray and I have a song, `Kangaroo Tennis Shoes,' in which this
11-year-old has his first pair of tennies and all the things he is
going to do in them.''
   And, Webb is working with Dale Wasserman, librettist of ``Man of
La Mancha,'' on a George Bernard Shaw play, ``The Shewing Up of
Blanco Bosnet.''
   ``It's a one-act play about the Old West, about which Shaw knew
absolutely nothing, which makes it hilarious,'' Webb says. ``We
have a commitment from the Abbey Theater in Dublin.''
   Webb says he has also written eight chapters of a novel about a
boy of 12 growing up in southwest Oklahoma. ``It is about me, quite
a lot about my grandfather and my sons are woven in there, as
well,'' he says.
   Webb and his wife Patsy got married under a big oak tree, on
musician Jimmy Messina's ranch in Ojai, Calif. The composer of
``Up, Up and Away'' had a balloon for guests to ride in at the
wedding reception.
   They now have five sons, Chris, 15, Justin, 12, James, 9, Corey,
5, and Charles, 9 months.
