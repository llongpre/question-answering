   A thousand school children, joined by
professional dancers, senior citizens, New York City cops and
Australian lifeguards, celebrated ``A Day in the Life of Coney
Island'' in a dance recital at the Felt Forum.
   Tuesday's show was the National Dance Institute's annual ``Event
of the Year,'' which gets bigger and more joyful each year.
   Jacques d'Amboise, who founded the institute in 1976 to teach
dancing to schoolboys, wrote this year's story. He also wrote most
of the lyrics and conductor Lee Norris wrote most of the tunes used
for the dances.
   The event is no longer limited to boys _ this year's dancers,
male and female, ranged in age from 3 to 85.
   Dawn broke at Coney Island with ``waves,'' children frm three
Staten Island public schools dancing in blue leotards. They were
joined by king crabs, in shades of red, and sea gulls with white
gauze capes over green leotards. Arpita Patel was their graceful
leader.
   Then a family entered the beach: Donlin Foreman from the Martha
Graham Dance Company as Mama, in a big white wig; Deni Lamont from
the New York City Ballet as Papa; small Alvin Fung with his wrist
in a cast, and Broadway dancer Valerie Wright.
   One of the most amusing dances was ``Sand Fleas'' by children
from Assumption-All Saints and St. Patrick's schools of Jersey
City. They began by lying on beach blankets. Then one foot
scratched the other ankle and soon they were up, dancing with much
scratching and shaking.
   Coney Island senior citizens and children from a public school
and a junior high for the deaf danced playing ballgames on the
beach. Children from four public schools and an intermediate school
in Brooklyn became a wonderful roller coaster.
   Children from five Chinatown public schools danced ``By the
Beautiful Sea,'' followed by a lively ``Boom Box Dance'' by
children from eight elementary and intermediate schools.
   Senior citizens from Chinatown received much applause for their
delicate ``Yet Yee'' dance. Seven deaf children danced and signed a
story of immigration, ``Grandmother's Mattress,'' written by
d'Amboise.
   Policemen nabbed Kevin Vaughan, trying to steal ``Mama's''
purse, while Judy Collins, who participates every year, sang a song
she wrote for the occasion.
   This year's recital was one of the events of the ``First New
York International Festival of the Arts.''
