   Irving Berlin's death at age 101 marked the end
of an era in American music, but his legacy lives on in his music,
friends and admirers said Saturday.
   ``Just knowing he was there'' was an inspiration, said John
Wallowitch, a composer and cabaret performer who had organized
Christmas Eve serenades outside Berlin's Manhattan town house for
more than 20 years.
   Upon hearing of Berlin's death, Wallowitch said, he and three
friends went to the reclusive songwriter's home.
   ``We just stood there and cried a lot and sang, `I'll be loving
you, always,''' he said. He said he planned to organize a larger,
candlelight vigil for Sunday night.
   Berlin, who wrote ``Always,'' ``God Bless America,'' ``White
Christmas,'' and more than 1,000 other songs in his long career,
died in his sleep at his home about 5:30 p.m. Friday.
   A spokesman said the funeral would be private, but plans for a
memorial service would be announced.
   Broadway theaters planned to dim their lights Saturday night in
honor of the man who wrote the scores for 19 shows, including
``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam.''
   The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, of
which Berlin was a charter member, planned to take out a full-page
testimonial in Monday's New York Times, said former president
Stanley Adams. ASCAP, which organized an all-star Carnegie Hall
salute to Berlin for his 100th birthday last year, also planned a
memorial.
   ``I think he's the greatest songwriter the world has ever had,''
Adams said.
   Composer-conductor Morton Gould, the president of ASCAP, said
Berlin's music has become ``part of our language, part of our
heartbeat, part of our soul.''
   In Boston, President Bush joined a crowd of thousands Saturday to
sing ``God Bless America.'' Bush was speaking at a luncheon of Roman
Catholic lawyers.
   Later, he said in a statement: ``Very few people have come to
touch and move the soul of a nation, reflecting its spirit and
traditions. Mr. Berlin ranks among such people, a composer, a
legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of
our nation.''
   Former President Reagan, who as an actor was featured along with
Berlin's songs in the flag-waving 1943 movie musical ``This is the
Army,'' said in a statement: ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened by
the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius
delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.''
   Actress-dancer Ginger Rogers said working with Berlin and her
longtime partner Fred Astaire in ``Top Hat,'' was ``like heaven,''
referring to the lyrics of Berlin's Oscar-nominated ``Cheek to
Cheek,'' which was featured in the classic 1935 film.
   Jack Horvath, a salesman at Carl Fischer Music in Manhattan, said
Berlin sheet music is still in demand. The nearly 50-year-old
``White Christmas'' is the store's No. 1 seller during the holidays,
he said.
   ``I personally went up to his office last Christmas and picked up
500 copies because it had gone so fast,'' Horvath said.
   ``He wrote songs for the people,'' said opera singer Robert
Merrill. ``Irving Berlin was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter.
He was not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a
feeling for melody and words that was precious.''
   ``There'll never be another Irving Berlin. It's an era that's
gone.''
