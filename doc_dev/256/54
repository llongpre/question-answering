   Danny Elfman's hopes for a music career seemed
doomed from the start. Guitar, piano and violin teachers offered him
the same advice _ forget it.
   ``Danny, a musical career is not what we recommend for you. You
like art. Can you paint? Can you draw? Why don't you try to find
something else?''
   Today, the 37-year-old Elfman is among the most sought-after film
composers. The latest of his 15 scores is for Warren Beatty's ``Dick
Tracy.''
   Elfman almost giggles as he recalls those rejections from his
youth. ``I received nothing but discouragement. I just had no
apptitude as a musician.'' Those music teachers, wherever they are,
ought to be ashamed of themselves. Elfman was no prodigy, but the
frenetic front man for the rock band Oingo Boingo is showing up his
early critics.
   More than an adequate guitar player, Elfman is in his 11th year
of belting out songs of black humor about death and restless
spirits. Back in 1979, the band thought it would only survive for
six months.
   Oingo Boingo, a fixture on the Los Angeles club scene but a no-go
on mainstream radio, has a rabid following in, of all places,
Brazil, among surfers and skateboarders.
   ``You turn on Brazilian radio, you listen to any station for 45
minutes and you hear a Boingo song,'' Elfman says. ``At first I was
turned off because by our standards, we're not surf music. That's
the Beach Boys. I just had to adjust my way of thinking. If
Brazilian surfers want to listen to Oingo Boingo, who's to tell them
not to?''
   Avant-garde movie director Tim Burton saw Oingo Boingo at a club
in Los Angeles and recruited Elfman to score ``Pee-wee's Big
Adventure.'' More Burton works _ ``Beetlejuice,'' and last summer's
blockbuster ``Batman'' _ followed. Later this year, Burton and
Elfman's teamwork on ``Edward Scissorhands'' will be in theaters.
   ``It's pretty much nonstop,'' Elfman said in a recent interview
following a sold-out Oingo Boingo concert at the Royal Oak Music
Theater.
   ``I am in a unique position that I never could have quite
imagined myself in. It kind of came out of the blue with `Pee-wee's
Big Adventure.'''
   Elfman was typecast as a composer for film comedies. He took a
few more, then began to decline because he had the band to consider.
Oingo Boingo recently completed its first tour east of the Rockies
to promote its new album, ``Dark at the End of the Tunnel,'' on MCA.
   Oingo Boingo _ the name really doesn't mean anything, Elfman says
_ still has its lead man. But time is tight when you juggle careers
as disparate as rock music and film composing.
   ``I don't think the same when I'm doing one or the other. ... I'm
very disciplined as a film composer,'' Elfman says. ``It means I
work ... 12 hours a day, seven days a week when I'm scoring. You
have so-and-so many minutes of music to write. You have 30 days. You
have 60 minutes of music. That's two minutes a day _ that's the
bottom line, an absolute.''
   Writing songs for the band is the opposite. ``I can never make
myself write a song. In fact, that's a sure way not to write a song.
Songs come when they damn well please.''
   Elfman usually limits himself to two movie scores a year, and
some for television, including the hit animated series ``The
Simpsons.''
   Beatty lured Elfman back from a vacation in the Bahamas to talk
about doing ``Dick Tracy.'' Elfman stalled Beatty for a weekend of
Caribbean sun but couldn't refuse the job.
   A recording of his score is one of three albums being released
from the movie. Rock singer Madonna, who co-stars with Beatty, has
an album on which she sings many of the Stephen Sondheim lyrics from
the film. A record of source music also is scheduled.
   Oingo Boingo's recent tour was a nice change of pace for Elfman,
but it's composing that most excites _ and frustrates _ him.
   Take ``Batman.'' Elfman created the brooding musical backdrop,
yet pop star Prince received most of the attention. It was much
later that music fans and the music press realized ``Batman'' had
Elfman's score and Prince's soundtrack.
   ``It was annoying for me before the movie came out that people
didn't know the difference.'' Elfman artistically would prefer the
score to be the only music to a movie, but he understands marketing
realities.
   Oingo Boingo has contributed plenty of songs to film, including
``Flesh and Blood'' from its current album to ``Ghostbusters II,''
the title song to ``Summer School'' and the theme song to ``Weird
Science.''
