<HEAD>`Popeye' Theme Creator Sammy Lerner Dead at 86</HEAD>

   Sammy Lerner, the Hollywood songwriter whose
lyrics ``I'm strong to the finich 'cause I eats me spinach''
created a loyal following for Popeye the Sailor Man, has died of
cancer. He was 86.
   Lerner died Wednesday at a Los Angeles nursing home, said a
spokeswoman for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   The serious songwriter said he was horrified by the 1932 theme
``I'm Popeye the Sailor Man,'' which he composed in less than two
hours for cartoonist Dave Fleischer.
   ``When I saw that first cartoon, I wanted to crawl in a
corner,'' Lerner said in a 1977 interview. ```Just do me a favor,'
I said. `Don't put my name on the screen.'''
   Lerner was as adept at nonsense cartoon lyrics as he was with
the romantic and breezy standards of Tin Pan Alley.
   His work in the 1930s and 1940s included ``Is It True What They
Say About Dixie,'' a song immortalized by Al Jolson, and English
lyrics to ``Falling in Love Again,'' Marlene Dietrich's song in the
film, ``The Blue Angel.''
   Lerner also wrote the theme for Betty Boop and a number of
``bouncing ball'' musical cartoon songs.
   Born in Saveni, Romania, in 1903, Lerner emigrated with his
family to Detroit, where he attended Wayne State University.
   He began writing songs for vaudeville acts and lyrics for the
Ziegfeld Follies stage shows in New York. Soon he was composing
lyrics for cartoons in Hollywood and songs for film musicals,
including ``Blondie Meets the Boss,'' ``The Lady Vanishes'' and
``Lady From Cheyenne.''
   He collaborated with such popular composers as Hoagy Carmichael,
Richard Whiting, Gerald Marks, Irving Caesar and Burton Lane.
   Lerner is survived by his wife of 53 years, Dorothy.
