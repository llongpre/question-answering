   Paul Kelly's songs could take place anytime,
anywhere: the 19th century in Australia, Europe in the 1940s,
contemporary America.
   Bus trips, history books and old girlfriends provide inspiration.
With his band, the Messengers, Kelly sings of love in vain, mystery
trains and hearts too big for the body.
   His influences include rock 'n' rollers Chuck Berry and Lou Reed,
bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, and author Raymond Carver,
whose short story, ``So Much Water, So Close to Home,'' provides the
title for Kelly's third album.
   ``He definitely showed me how to write economically,'' how to
convey a lot of information in a short space, Kelly said of the late
writer. ``His voice often has the ring of true speech. That's
something I've tried to do with my songs.''
   His songs are often three-minute stories, condensing days, even
years, into just a few stanzas. But if Kelly believes in writing
words that linger, the melody, he insists, comes first.
   ``I wouldn't want people to think of songs just in terms of the
lyrics. By making the words fit the melody, you open your stories up
to chance. Sometimes the melody is going to make your story go
somewhere. I don't sit to write a story in a song; it's usually the
other way around.''
   He contrasts bitter lyrics and happy music, singing
``Everything's Turning to White'' so sweetly that only careful
listeners will pick up Kelly's rendition of Carver's bitter story
about a man's indifference to a young girl's death.
   Myths are also important, whether his own or someone
else's.``Pigeon-Jundamarra'' is based on a true story about an
Aboriginal resistance hero from the late 19th century who kills his
former masters and heads for the hills. Kelly added his own twist.
   ``He knew the country so well and had knowledge of this extensive
cave system,'' the musician said. ``He was very hard to catch and
became almost supernatural. People believed he could never be caught
by a white man's bullet. ``It was surprising that the song turned
out very short and was written from the point of view of the officer
chasing him. I started with a formal story in my mind; the officer
chasing him is just a fictional character. There was certainly no
Officer O'Malley.''
   Kelly, born in Australia, grew up listening to rock 'n' roll,
playing the trumpet and writing short stories. By age 18, he was
ready to take up the guitar and write songs.
   ``I knew that I wanted to write so I was keeping a journal, but
it took me a couple of years before I actually wrote a song. It was
in F and G and sounded a bit like (Bob Dylan's) `Percy's Song.'''
   He began his career in 1976, working in bands in Melbourne and
gradually meeting the musicians who became the Messengers: Steve
Connelly, Michael Barclay, Peter Bull and Jon Schorfield.
   ``I've known Steve and Michael for a while because we all lived
in Melbourne for a stage and we've seen each other in bands,'' Kelly
said.
   ``I moved up to Sydney in 1984 and we worked together as a trio.
That was also the time I met Peter, who was playing in another band
at the time. We made an acoustic record and Michael sang on it.''
   He made a solo album, ``Post,'' in 1984, but began to acquire a
real following with ``Gossip,'' a double album released two years
later that featured the Messengers. Trains were there from the
start. ``Last Train to Heaven'' recalls a time when trains were a
symbol of unavoidable fate, that could take away your true love
forever or provide your escape to a better world.
   ``It's a symbol of death in dreams,'' Kelly added. ``Freud always
listed one of the death symbols as a train. I sort of unconsciously
absorbed it. I didn't realize it until later that I wrote so often
about trains.''
   The ballad ``Cities of Texas'' was written on a bus, one that
pulled into Dallas during the first American tour. Kelly sings with
the deepest longing, like a man saying goodbye.
   ``I guess it's like the kind of longing you have for something
you feel is going to pass away,'' he said. ``You walk into Dallas
and you walk up to a building and touch it, it's solid, seems like
it's going to be around for a long time. But seeing it from a
distance, it's like, `Here today, gone tomorrow.'
   ``Dallas made a big impression on me. The city seemed to shimmer
with all the glass reflected. It's a song of mourning, so beautiful
but it's going to go away.''
