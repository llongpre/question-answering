   Thomas Broadus Shearman, a publisher of
the Lake Charles American Press who crusaded against gambling in
the 1950s, died Monday. He was 94.
   Shearman entered the newspaper business as an advertising
salesman for The Chicago Tribune in 1914. He bought the Lake
Charles paper in 1943 and acquired the Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record
in 1933 and the Hobbs (N.M.) Daily Sun and the Trinidad (Colo.)
Chronicle News in 1936.
   As a result of his crusade against gambling in southwestern
Louisiana, he and four other journalists were indicted by a special
Calcasieu Parish grand jury on charges they defamed 16 public
officials and three admitted gamblers.
   A special judge appointed to hear the case acquitted the five,
saying every allegation made in articles and editorials was without
malice and was either true or could reasonably be believed to be
true. With legislative help casinos and slot machines were
eventually eliminated.
