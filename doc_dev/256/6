   Academy Award-winning composer Sammy Fain,
who wrote such enduring tunes as ``Love Is a Many Splendored
Thing,'' ``That Old Feeling'' and the wartime classic ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   The two-time Oscar recipient, who suffered a heart attack, was
at the UCLA Medical Center when he died, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most memorable pop
hits of American music this century.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``Let A Smile
Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Wedding Bells Are
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night''
among them.
   ```I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
said ASCAP President Morton Gould of the World War II song.
   ``It's hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He
was such a sweet person, such a gentle person,'' Gould said.
   Fain's collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis
Webster, Mitchell Parish, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg, and Alan and
Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said lyricist Parish in a telephone interview
from New York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets. Workmen, whatever
they were doing, would be singing strains of our songs. ... That
explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain was nominated for 10 Academy Awards during his long career.
He won for best song for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from
the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Known for a self-effacing style, Fain's modesty even extended to
Academy Award politics. When he had a little-heard 1976
Oscar-nominated song, ``A World That Never Was,'' from a
little-seen movie called ``Half a House,'' he said in a trade paper
advertisement: ``It would be nice if we had a commercial record,
but we don't. It would also be nice if we were in a widely seen
motion picture, but we don't have that, either.''
   To make up for those shortcomings, Fain provided a
``Dial-a-Song'' phone number so Academy voters could hear his song.
But the award went to ``Evergreen'' that year.
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902, Fain was
a piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until
teaming with lyricist Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows
What A Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash review
``Hellzapoppin'' in 1938.
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that same year, ``I'll Be
Seeing You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime
classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote all the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
lifetime achievement.
   He had been a member of the ASCAP board of directors for the
past 10 years.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.
