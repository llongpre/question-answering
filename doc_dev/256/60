   Another member of this select telephone circle is Stanley Green,
a musical comedy historian and author of several books about the
Broadway musical. Green last spoke to Berlin when Fred Astaire died
last year. Berlin called Green to express his regret about the
passing of a man he admired very much.
   Most of Berlin's contemporaries are dead. He's the last of the
great musical comedy composers, a pantheon that once included
George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers. Of
his theater contemporaries, only director George Abbott, who turns
101 in June, survives.
   Berlin, born Israel Baline in Russia, came to the United States
at the age of 2. His family settled on New York's Lower East Side
where, as a young boy, Berlin got jobs singing on the Bowery. He
worked as song plugger and a singing waiter at a Chinatown cafe. It
was there that he learned to play the piano, laboriously picking
out tunes with one finger. This self-taught musician writes the
same way.
   `It's an incredible catalog this man has achieved with no formal
education as well as no musical education,'' Green says. ``And to
be able to write music AND lyrics.''
   For all his success, Berlin is a loner, a man very much aware of
his humble origins. His first wife, Dorothy, died from typhoid
fever less than a year after they were married.
   In 1926, Berlin married his second wife, Ellin Mackay, the
daughter of a wealthy and socially prominent businessman, Clarence
Mackay, the president of a commercial telegraph company. She eloped
with Berlin over her Catholic father's objections and the marriage
was front-page news all over the country.
   In the more than 60 years they have been married, Berlin has
kept his wife and his three daughters out of the public eye.
   ``I think a reason he is so very private is that he is wildly in
love with his wife,'' Wallowitch says. ``I think it is one of the
greatest romantic love affairs in history.''
   Berlin is the only major songwriter who never had a film
biography like Cole Porter's ``Night and Day,'' George Gershwin's
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' Sigmund Romberg's ``Deep in My Heart'' or
Rodgers and Hart's ``Words and Music.''
   Coupled with his desire for privacy was Berlin's shrewd business
instincts. In the early 1920s, he and two partners built the Music
Box Theater to showcase his musical revues. He and the Shubert
Organization still own it.
   His music publishing company tightly controls his songs. ASCAP
won't reveal the amount of money these melodies have generated, but
the man is believed to be a millionaire many times over. Berlin
gave the royalties from ``God Bless America'' to the Boy Scouts and
Girl Scouts of America. So far, they have earned some $700,000 from
that one song.
   Berlin withdrew even more from the public eye in 1962 after his
last Broadway musical, ``Mr. President,'' flopped. The show,
starring Robert Ryan and Nanette Fabray, was a wildly anticipated
musical, generating a record box-office advance but tepid reviews.
It had a six-month run.
   Still he came back. Four years later, he wrote a new song, ``An
Old- Fashioned Wedding'' for the Lincoln Center revival of ``Annie
Get Your Gun'' which starred Ethel Merman. Twenty years after the
original production, she stopped the show again with Berlin's new
song.
   In all his years of serenading Berlin, Wallowitch finally was
invited into the Berlin home nearly five Christmas Eves ago after a
chorus of ``White Christmas.'' On an impulse, he rang the doorbell.
A maid answered the door and he and his fellow singers were taken
into the kitchen.
   There they were greeted by Berlin himself, wearing a bathrobe
and slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and
told them, ``That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.''
   Every day, Wallowitch walks his dog Winnie around Beekman Place
and often wonders what is going on inside the big house now.
   ``I keep holding on to the idea that the man is not allowing
himself to be bored and is still writing,'' Wallowitch says. ``God,
I hope it's true.''
