   The Queen Mother's mayonnaise and Glenda Jackson's
baked bananas are featured among nearly 150 recipes compiled for a
children's charity cookbook.
   The 125-page ``Celebrity Choice Cookbook'' lists mostly simple,
quick recipes such as actor Jeremy Iron's ``Champ'' _ a mixture of
green onions and mashed potatoes that he says will ``kindle the
coldest heart.''
   Comedian Spike Milligan recommends ``spaghetti dolce,'' which is
made by pouring cream and brandy over cooked pasta.
   Others offered more elegant cuisine, such as rock star Roger
Daltrey's trout in sweet pepper puree.
   Singer Boy George sent in his dad's curry supreme and heavyweight
boxing world contender Frank Bruno added red snapper Creole,
``ideally accompanied by Perrier water.''
   About one-sixth of the proceeds from the book will be given to
the British Broadcasting Corp.'s Children In Need Appeal.

   Robert ``Evel'' Knievel and his wife owe the
U.S. government more than $5.3 million in taxes and penalties for
the years 1972-76, a federal judge says.
   Papers filed by the government in October 1987 said the Knievels
were $4.8 million in arrears in taxes, interest and penalties.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Hatfield of Great Falls took the case
last December after the Knievels failed within alloted time to file
an answer to a motion for a summary judgment, and he approved it
last week.
   Hatfield said in January that the Knievels' ``lack of response is
deemed an admission that, in the opinion of counsel for the
defendants, the motion is well taken.''
   The government first sued the former motorcycle stuntman and his
wife Linda for income tax liabilities in December 1983. Attempts to
negotiate a settlement failed and the government sought the judgment
in federal court.

   Rock singer John Fogerty spent two days on
the witness stand during his plagiarism trial, much of it with
guitar in hand, setting several jurors to swaying in their seats as
he played a series of his hits.
   The case brought by Fantasy Records was sent to the six-member
U.S. District Court jury late Friday. Deliberations begin Monday.
   Fogerty is accused of copying the melody of his 1970 Creedence
Clearwater Revival hit ``Run Through the Jungle'' when he wrote
``Old Man Down the Road,'' the lead single for his 1984 comeback
``Centerfield'' album. Fantasy owns the rights to the earlier song.
   ``He was aware of the fact that his stature as a star had been
eroded by the passage of time,'' Norman Rudman, a lawyer for Fantasy
Records, told the jury. ``The desire to succeed may stimulate a
desire to recapture the things he'd done before.''
   But Fogerty's lawyer, Kenneth Sidle, said Fogerty ``is a great
songwriter. He doesn't need to copy his old songs to come up with
good new songs.''
   Any similarities between the two songs were due to the fact that
they were ``written by the same person with the same musical style
and vocabulary,'' common to many of his past and present songs,
Sidle said.
   On the witness stand, Fogerty played several of his Creedence
Clearwater Revival hits _ ``Proud Mary,'' ``Green River,'' ``Down on
the Corner,'' ``Fortunate Son'' _ and described how he wrote them.

   Comedian Bill Cosby is giving $20 million to
Atlanta's Spelman College for a new academic center, in the largest
gift in the history of the black women's college.
   Cosby announced the donation from him and his wife, Camille, at
ceremonies Friday marking the inauguration of Spelman President
Johnnetta B. Cole.
   ``Mrs. Cosby and I have been blessed because I found a vein of
gold in the side of a mountain,'' Cosby said. ``Mrs. Cosby and I
wanted this woman (Ms. Cole) to know how much we love this school.''
   A daughter of Cosby's attended Spelman, and episodes of his hit
TV series, ``The Cosby Show,'' have been filmed there.
   The donation, the largest in Spelman's 107 years, will be used
mostly to construct an academic center, doubling the college's
classroom space. The new building will also house a research center
dedicated to the works of black women.
   Cosby's donation was cheered loudly by 2,000 in attendance at
Friday's inauguration, but the comedian cautioned them that the new
center is not built yet.
   ``I don't know how long it will take. All of the best intentions
can be circumvented by some plumber,'' he joked.
