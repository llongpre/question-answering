A Miami woman is suing Julio Iglesias on the grounds that he defrauded her of 
royalties from a song they wrote together. 
</P>
<P>
Grecia (Mimi) Korman wants $50,000 in damages, plus interest, court costs and 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
Korman says that in 1978 Iglesias asked her to help write a Spanish adaptation 
of the French song "J'ai Oublie de Vivre" ("I've Forgotten to Live"). She says 
she worked with some of his preliminary lyrics and a month later presented him 
with a finished product. 
</P>
<P>
The song appeared on at least seven albums with Korman and Iglesias listed as 
co-writers, but Korman says Iglesias entered into a contract with the French 
publishers of the song, presenting himself as the sole writer.
