   Lou Reed's new album, ``New York,'' has been
receiving much critical attention because of its unsparing lyrics
about urban blight.
   He has been asked about lyrical content so much, he wonders why
writers don't go beyond the subject and concern themselves with the
poetry in which the lyrics are expressed.
   ``The opening of `Romeo Had Juliette' _ `Caught between the
twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that brought
Columbus to New York' _ you've got to admit that's a great opening
line,'' Reed says. ``Forget about what it means and think of the
flow of words. I wish people would notice. Don't you get some kind
of pleasure when you listen to the language?
   ``It's the first song I wrote for the album; it was the standard
for the rest. We had the luxury to go in and test out the studio.
We tested it with `Romeo' and kept the cut we did for the record.''
   Reed talked about his music in an interview at the American
Sound Studio, where he and a band were rehearsing for a tour that
will include an engagement at Broadway's St. James Theater.
   That's a distance from Reed's early, scruffy days in the Velvet
Underground. The group was discovered in 1967 in New York's
underground rock scene by the late pop artist, Andy Warhol, who
promoted them. It remained menacingly non-mainstream and didn't
become commercial. Later, though, it became a role model for punk
rock. Working solo since 1970, Reed has had only one pop hit,
``Walk on the Wild Side,'' in 1973.
   Next November, Reed and John Cale, who also left the Velvet
Underground in 1970, will present an evening of songs in tribute to
Warhol at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
   When he was cutting ``New York'' _ as lyrically street-tough as
ever but accepted in these days of rappers and U2 _ Reed wasn't
expecting media attention.
   ``You can tell from listening we weren't thinking in terms of
radio airplay,'' he said.
   ``Dirty Blvd.'' begins: ``Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel.
He looks out a window without glass. The walls are made of
cardboard newspapers on his feet. His father beats him 'cause he's
too tired to beg.''
   Sire Records wanted to market a single, but Reed said he wasn't
the type of person to sell singles. ``I pushed for `Dirty Blvd.'
because I thought the single should at least be representative of
the album. Look what happened,'' he said.
   ``New York'' is selling better than any previous Lou Reed album,
and is fast climbing the charts.
   A liner note on ``New York'' says, ``You can't beat 2 guitars,
bass, drum.'' The sound of the record was important to Reed, that
the words be understandable and the guitars sound real.
   ``Even though Segovia said an electric guitar is an abomination,
what I like about an electric guitar is it can have all this body
from the wood in it,'' he said. ``We had as one of our goals to
record it so it comes across that way and doesn't sound like a
synthesizer _ thinned out and high endy.
   ``One thing was not to have too many instruments. We wanted my
solos on guitar to be thick and beautiful. We wanted everything to
be heard. Of course, when there's not too many parts, there's
nothing to hide behind. Any mediocrity is heard.''
   His singing is basically talking, and has always been that way.
``In my mind I would like to sing like Otis Redding or Al Green. I
can't, so I had to find a way I could use my range in my style.''
   About the songs, Reed said he doesn't know why he wrote them.
``I didn't sit and say, `I'm going to write about this and this.'
   ``I had pieces of songs. Whatever I get first, I can't change,''
he said. ``I can juggle around with later things, but the first
phrase or line of melody or title I get for a song, I can't change
it. I had the title `Dime Store Mystery' for 20 years. My wife,
Sylvia, said, `When are you going to finish it?' It came up on this
album.
   ``I like that song a lot. It had an odd effect on us when it was
recorded. We were taken someplace else. I can't say where that
someplace was.
   ``I guess people don't expect much out of records. They keep
staying on the plot and asking, `Who do you know in a welfare
hotel?' `Dime Store Mystery' dispenses with plot.''
   Reed said what the album is really about is the use of language.
``That's what I'm really getting off on. There are phrases in there
as good as anything I've ever written.
   ``It is pretty funny, some of it, I thought. It's not endlessly
grim.''
   Reed took part in a benefit concert Paul Simon organized at
Madison Square Garden to buy and equip a medical van to visit New
York welfare hotels. ``Paul bought one with the proceeds of
`Graceland.' Every penny from this concert went to get another
one.''
   Reed has been told that ``Last Great American Whale'' from ``New
York'' will be on a Greenpeace album released in the Soviet Union.
When he's asked if that's a real Indian myth, he says: ``It is now.
It's an American Indian-Jewish myth. In Europe all the great myths
have been taken. Wouldn't it be nice if we could still write a myth
and do it well enough so it held up? I wanted to try to do that.
Why not?''
   Asked about solutions to the big-city problems limned on ``New
York,'' Reed says, ``We only had an hour. We'll get into solutions
on Vol. 2, maybe.''
