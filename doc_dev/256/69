   With America facing the possibility of
another war and the unbound optimism of the 1980s becoming
threadbare, the late Phil Ochs' songs carry the same bite today as
they did two decades ago.
   And they're getting wider play again, at least in the East.
   Verses such as ``So young so strong so ready for the war, so
willing to go and die upon a foreign shore,'' from ``One More
Parade,'' could just as easily be a lament about soldiers marching
off to the Persian Gulf as Southeast Asia.
   And, ``If you can't afford your bill don't tell me that you're
ill, 'cause that's the free enterprise way,'' from the sarcastic
``AMA Song,'' rings a chord for people hit by the spiraling cost of
health care.
   Ochs - sounds like ``oaks'' - wrote those songs in the '60s,
when his gift for composing tuneful poison-pen letters to the
establishment placed him near the top of the heap of popular folk
singers.
   ``I think everybody in the field at the time felt he had a great
influence and was a great writer,'' said Dick Cerri, president of
the World Folk Music Association.
   ``As a songwriter ... he was second to only (Bob) Dylan in the
late '60s,'' said Ochs' brother and former manager, Michael Ochs.
   But when the peace and love spirit of the Woodstock generation
withered in the early '70s, so too did Ochs' spirit. Feeling he
lost touch with his audience and his abilities, he killed himself
in 1976 at the age of 36.
   But this is a case where the old cliche is true: the death
silenced Ochs, but not his music. Old Ochs songs have been ringing
out with regularity the last eight years in clubs from
Massachusetts to the Mason-Dixon line.
   Keeping the spirit of her younger brother alive, Sonny Ochs has
been organizing ``Phil Ochs Song Nights,'' during which old folkies
and younger performers highlight Ochs' extensive song catalog. A
typical performance recently in Albany, less than 40 miles from her
rural Middleburgh home, featured national folk stars Nancy Tucker
and Magpie sharing a club stage with local acts.
   ``I get all these people together through Phil's music,'' Ochs
said.
   She has been organizing the concerts since 1982, when choosing
the line-up for a planned memorial show at the now-defunct
Speakeasy in Manhattan inadvertently fell in her lap.
   ``I picked up the ball and ran with it and I've been running
ever since,'' she said.
   Ochs has since put on shows all over the East.
   ``I just did not want the songs to die. What would have been the
point of his life if no one listened to them anymore?'' she asked.
   Born Dec. 19, 1940, in El Paso, Texas, Phil Ochs was mostly
raised in the East. Following an in-and-out college career, he
headed to where every aspiring folkie headed in the early '60s -
Greenwich Village.
   ``I was very arrogant at the time, and I thought I'd be the best
songwriter in the world,'' he said. ``But then I immediately met
Dylan and decided that I'd be the second-best songwriter in the
world.''
   Ochs built a following on the strength of songs like ``I Ain't
Marchin' Any More'' and ``When I'm Gone.''
   A keen observer and sharp wit in the tradition of Woody Guthrie,
Ochs fired lyrical salvos at everyone from the Nixon administration
to fellow liberals. His acid tongue attracted listeners, but also
scared a lot of people off.
   ``Everyone just assumed he was a raving commie, but he wasn't,''
said Michael Ochs. Not as lovable as Peter, Paul &amp; Mary or as
drop-dead cool as his estranged friend Dylan, Ochs was mostly
ignored by the mass media.
   ``He was censored when he was alive,'' Sonny Ochs said. ``He
couldn't get on national TV or radio.''
   Even without media attention, Ochs could sell out a hall,
including Carnegie Hall three times, and he relied on album sales.
He also maintained a high profile in the civil rights and anti-war
movements.
   But he grew disillusioned when the anti-establishment fervor
faded after the '60s. He moved on to more introspective songs, and
he became depressed.
   ``He felt he didn't fit in anymore,'' Michael Ochs said.
   His sister said Phil felt he lost his gift for writing songs. He
began avoiding live appearances and stopped writing songs.
   ``He refused to even try,'' she said. ``The last three years
were the worst.''
   On April 9, 1976, he hanged himself in his sister's bathroom in
New York City.
