<LEADPARA>  THE new Disney movie "Beauty and the Beast" becomes still more poignant when
one realizes it contains the final completed score of playwright and lyricist
Howard Ashman, who died in March of AIDS at age 40.;   Both Alan Menken, his
collaborator on several scores, and Linda Woolverton, with whom he shaped the
"Beauty and the Beast" screenplay, found it difficult to put into words their
sorrow at his early death. "He was one of my closest, dearest friends," Menken
said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ashman shared an Academy Award for best song with composer Menken for
"Under the Sea" from "The Little Mermaid." The duo also wrote the score for
"Little Shop of Horrors," which became the highest-grossing musical in
off-Broadway history (and was subsequently made into a film by director Frank
Oz).;   Menken and Ashman completed the score for "Aladdin," Disney's next
animated musical, before his death. However, the story subsequently has been
revised, necessitating the writing of new songs, Menken said.;   Menken is
collaborating on the new material with Tim Rice, who has written lyrics for a
number of Andrew Lloyd Webber shows.;   Menken said Ashman never wrote an
anti-AIDS statement into his songs, but he said he sometimes hears echoes of
his collaborator's struggles in his lyrics.;   "The last song we wrote for
'Aladdin' is called 'Humiliate the Boy,' " he noted. "(The villain) is
stripping the boy of all the powers that he had.;   "At the time, Howard was
being stripped of all his abilities," he said quietly. (box)  </TEXT>
