   Four years ago in Austin, Texas, Laurie Freelove
had a plan: She wanted to meet Gretchen Phillips and start a band
with her.
   Around that same time, Phillips was mourning the demise of her
previous group, Meat Joy, and longed to start another one. She and
Freelove met and were soon playing guitar together at coffee houses.
They performed Monkees songs, rock 'n' roll, old movie tunes as well
as their own material.
   They called themselves Two Nice Girls.
   A few months later, Freelove and Phillips met Kathy Korniloff and
were so pleased with how their voices and guitars sounded together
they decided to add her to the group.
   The name? Two Nice Girls.
   ``That was my idea,'' Phillips explained. ``It beat the hell of
out of The Jackson Five. Some friends of mine were in a band called
Five Happy Guys. One of them left so they changed the name to The
Happiness Crew. We were called Two Nice Girls and hired somebody
else, but I didn't want to change the name.''
   They are a major part of a lively Austin music scene that has
attracted the attention of critics around the country. All three
Nice Girls, however, grew up elsewhere.
   Phillips attended Houston's High School for the Performing Arts
and headed to Austin after graduating.
   ``My first song was a duet that I wrote for my sister and I,''
she recalled. ``We would take baths together and it would take
forever. The song went, `102, oo oo oo . . 107, 111.' That was it.
Then we would take the washcloth and suck the water out of it. I had
no idea what it was about.''
   Freelove grew up in Alexandria, Va., and went to a Catholic
girls' high school outside of Rome.
   ``I've been writing songs since I was this high,'' Freelove said.
``I used to have to vacuum and clean the house and I used to make up
songs. I have tapes of almost everything I've done. I've got gobs of
tapes of when I was a little guy. I was a much better songwriter
when I was 13.''
   Korniloff, the daughter of violinists, lived in The Netherlands
and Scarsdale, N.Y.
   ``My first song was a very, very sad love song about a boy who
was supposed to my boyfriend who I caught with another girl. I was
so devastated. I went upstairs to the attic of my house with my
little guitar and played my heart out.''
   Their debut album, ``2 Nice Girls,'' features original songs from
all three and a unique overlapping of Lou Reed's ``Sweet Jane'' and
Joan Armatrading's ``Love and Affection.'' The version on ``2 Nice
Girls'' was a live performance on an Austin public radio station.
   ``We went on for an hour-long program called `Live Set,'''
Korniloff said. ``Our friends were all invited to be in the studio
and lend that live clapping air to the show.
   ``We tried a couple of times to record the song in the studio,
but we could never recapture vocally what we did that one time. As
it turned out, the station still had the master copy on two-track
which they let us use. They said, `It's your performance; we only
have the tape.'''
   The melodies and sweet harmonies make Two Nice Girls easy to
listen to, but ``My Heart Crawls Off,'' written by Phillips and Sara
Hickman, is a bitter song about jealousy.
   ``That's the power of being a songwriter,'' Phillips said. ``I
just wrote this horrible song about (President) Bush that's got a
really lovely melody. If I just made another punk anthem called `I
Hate You,' it wouldn't be really effective.''
   Freelove wrote ``Money,'' a long way from the Motown hit of the
same title that proclaimed, ``The best things in life are free, but
you can keep it for the bird and bees.'' Instead, Freelove warns
against being ``a slave to money.''
   ``It's about money and obsession and the ways it numbs you out,''
Freelove said. ``Money keeps many of us protected from distressing
things, disturbing things. People who have money can shield
themselves from observing the homeless.''
   Their sound recalls The Roches and Indigo Girls. But what could
have influenced Phillips' ``I Spent my Last Ten Dollars (on Birth
Control and Beer)'' or ``The Holland Song,'' in which Korniloff
sings, ``The Dutch are too much''?
   ``I don't really think of these songs as song of experience, but
songs of perspective,'' she said. ``I think that the content of the
songs are much more about how life ought to be. What we'd like for
it to be like.
   ``We consciously try to create a sense of community. It's more
likely to save us from horribly depressing lives. You have some sort
of good feelings. Bands are at an advantage, they're capable of
doing that.''
