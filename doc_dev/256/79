   Dressed in jeans and white T-shirts, calmly
puffing Marlboros, Marti Jones and husband Don Dixon look as if
they make records with all the urgency of vacuuming the living room
carpet.
   But they have plenty to worry about. Jones' first three albums,
produced by Dixon, sold poorly despite mostly favorable reviews,
and the singer has switched record labels, from A&amp;M to RCA, hoping
her luck will change.
   With just a few ``pockets of popularity'' - New York, Washington
- paying the bills, disagreements can emerge. On ``Any Kind of
Lie,'' the arguments are in the lyrics themselves.
   Even talking about the record gets them going.
   ``It was real easy,'' Jones insisted during an interview at the
RCA offices in Manhattan. ``We stayed home for about 2{ months.
We'd get up and Dixon would be working on something and I'd be
cleaning up the kitchen, or wanting to do laundry or go see my
mother or something.
   ``And he'd say, `I just want to work on this song,' and I knew
when I came back if I didn't do something he'd have it finished.''
   ``It took a long time,'' countered Dixon, flicking an ash. ``We
started this record from scratch. We were trying to figure out what
to do. The biggest difference in this record from Marti's other
records is this is more groove based. It's a little bit more of a
band record.''
   Sometimes, the only way to break through the Jones-Dixon line
and get the whole story is to take their responses and split the
difference. In ``My Tears Are Poison,'' they make like Sonny and
Cher in a trailer park, tossing verbal pots and pans about money
and television and pets and babies.
   ``We're like Buddy and Sally of the `Dick Van Dyke Show,' ''
Jones said of the bickering scriptwriting team from the old
television series. ``When we would think of what to say on stage,
we'd say, `What would they do now? Would she do this or she do
that.' ''
   They met in the early 1980s, when Jones was struggling with a
band called Color Me Gone and Dixon, who had produced R.E.M., was
called in to help. Color Me Gone soon fell apart but Dixon was
impressed with Jones' singing and suggested they work together.
   That's when the trouble began.
   ``We wrote through the mail,'' recalled Jones, who lives with
Dixon in her native Ohio, and also spends time in Charlotte, N.C.
   ``I sent these lyrics to Dixon and he called me and said, `I got
your lyrics and on the way home from the post office I wrote the
song,' which was called `Rhythm and Shallow Breathing.' I was real
impressed. I was like, `Wow!' Then I found out there's this old
song he had and he just adapted it into this.''
   Until ``Any Kind of Lie,'' they preferred to let others do the
arguing. Cover versions of Graham Parker's ``You Can't Take Love
for Granted'' and Elvis Costello's ``Just a Memory'' earned her
respect among musicians, and so did her willingness to perform
songs by lesser-known writers such as Dwight Twilley and Richard
Barone.
   But after the 1988 album ``Used Guitars,'' Jones and Dixon took
a different approach. Before, they wrote just two or three songs
per record. On ``Any Kind of Lie,'' only two of the 11 songs are
nonoriginals.
   Jones gives two reasons: They were unimpressed with the outside
material submitted and, after watching some so-called pros at work,
they figured some of their own songs might be salvageable.
   With Jones and Dixon doing most of the writing, ``Any Kind of
Lie'' has a more consistent sound than ``Used Guitars,'' which
ranges from the jazzy ``Ruby'' to a folkish cover of John Hiatt's
``If I Can Love Somebody.''
   How it sounds to Jones and Dixon depends on which one you ask.
Again, it's Buddy and Sally time, a battle of selective memories,
with Jones leaning forward while she speaks and Dixon preferring to
recline.
   Jones: ``I think this record is sort of the relaxed version of
`Used Guitars.' ''
   Dixon: `` `Used Guitars' is real atmospheric.''
   Jones: ``It is, it's more bouyant. This is more mature.''
   Dixon: ``I think this is a real rock 'n' roll album.''
   Jones: ``This is real relaxed. I wasn't worried about the songs.
I wasn't worried about how it was going to turn out. There was not
a point where I was nervous. ... (Dixon is shaking his head) Of
course, I was worried the way I sounded singing. I completely
freaked out.''
