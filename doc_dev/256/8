   Composer Sammy Fain, a two-time Academy Award
winner who wrote ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   Fain died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical Center, said Ken
Sunshine, a publicist for the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most enduring pop
hits of American music this century.
   His collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Paul Francis Webster, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg
and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing
You,'' ``Wedding Bells are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and
``Tender Is the Night'' among them.
   Fain won his Academy Awards for best song, in the title for the
1955 film ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' and in 1953 for
``Secret Love'' from the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.'' Fain was
nominated for Oscars nine times during his career.
   He was born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902. A
piano prodigy, he unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with lyricist Kahal for their first hit ``Nobody Knows What a
Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in musical films, then returned to
Broadway and wrote songs for the smash review ``Hellzapoppin'' in
1938.
   Two songs from another failed Fain musical that same year,
``I'll Be Seeing You,'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I'' later became
wartime classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Fain and Hilliard wrote all the songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice
In Wonderland,'' including the tune ``I'm Late.''
   Fain also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's
``Peter Pan.'' After winning his ``Secret Love'' Oscar, Fain
collaborated to write the theme songs for several movies besides
the second Academy Award winner ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing.''
   Those included ``A Certain Smile,'' ``April Love,'' ``The Gift
of Love'' and ``Tender Is the Night.''
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
his lifetime achievement of writing popular music.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.
