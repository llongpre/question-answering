   Ninety years after James Weldon
Johnson wrote ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' for a group of school
children, the song known as the ``Black National Anthem'' has been
given new life by a group of well-known artists and singers.
   The recording, recently released as a single by Capitol Records,
features such artists as Stevie Wonder, Anita Baker, Bobby Brown,
Jeffrey Osbourne and Dionne Warwick. Each artist has a solo on the
recording, similar to the format used by Quincy Jones on the hit
``We Are the World'' record.
   Melba Moore, the Tony Award-winning actress and singer, was the
creative force behind the new recording of the song written by
Johnson, a lawyer, educator and civil rights leader who was born in
Jacksonville. Two versions of the song are included on her new
``Soul Exposed'' LP.
   Moore recently talked about the project in an interview.
   ``The original was really a hymn. The new one has a contemporary
sound. It sounds like a love song,'' Moore said.
   She said she told BeBe Winans about her idea to enlist the help
of other artists, and the gospel Grammy winner quickly contacted
musicians and singers and even took a sound engineer on the road to
record celebrities' voices for the recording.
   Also appearing on the record are Freddie Jackson, Take 6, Howard
Hewett, Stephanie Mills, BeBe and CeCe Winans, the Clark Sisters,
Terri Lynne Carrington and Gerald Albright.
   On the longer version of the song, the Rev. Jesse Jackson also
participates. In addition, actress and choreographer Debbie Allen
directed a video in which Jasmine Guy (``A Different World'')
dances to the song, with narration by Lou Gossett Jr.
   Moore said ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' has been one of her
favorite songs for a number of years, and she's performed it at
meetings of the National Council of Negro Women.
   In the liner notes for the album, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, executive
director of the NAACP, said, ``Every time I hear `Lift Every Voice
and Sing,' I am filled with a deep sense of pride. Ms. Moore's
treatment of this classic ... gives it new zest, vitality and
meaning.
   ``More than any other song, it represents our brave struggle for
freedom and equality, and the faith that has sustained us over all
these weary years. It is part of us, part of our culture and a
treasure to be loved and cherished.''
   Johnson wrote the lyrics to ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' and
his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, an accomplished musician, wrote
the music, for the Stanton School celebration of Abraham Lincoln's
birthday in 1900. A chorus of 500 black children sang the tune.
   Within 20 years, it was known around the world. The song became
an anthem for black Americans during the civil rights movement in
the 1960s.
   A portion of the proceeds of the album are being donated to the
NAACP, the United Negro College Fund and the National Association
for Sickle Cell Disease, Moore said.
   Moore, who was a schoolteacher in Newark, N.J., before going on
to star in Broadway productions of ``Hair,'' ``Timbuktu'' and
``Purlie,'' said she hopes that young people take to the new
version. It was important, she said, that children learn about
Johnson's contributions to American culture.
   ``He is one of our heroes. As far as writers go, everyone knowns
Langston Hughes and James Weldon Johnson,'' Moore said.
   James Weldon Johnson was a lawyer, author, civil rights
activist, educator, foreign consul and newspaper editor. There was
no high school for blacks in Jacksonville, so Johnson was sent to
Atlanta University to complete his education.
   After graduation in 1894, he returned to Jacksonville and became
principal of Stanton School, which he expanded into a high school
for black students.
   Johnson said he was not confronted with racial discrimination
until he was an adolescent.
   ``Neither my father nor mother had taught me directly anything
about race. ... My vague, early impressions constituted ... an
unconscious race-superiority complex. All the most interesting
things ... were being done by colored men,'' he wrote.
   Johnson started the first daily black newspaper in Florida, the
Daily American. He was the first black to pass the Florida Bar exam
and be permitted to practice.
   In 1901, he moved to New York City, where he and his brother
collaborated on 200 songs for musical comedies and light operas,
including``Congo Love Song'' and ``Since You Went Away.''
   As secretary to the NAACP from 1920 to 1930, he conducted the
first statistical analysis of lynching, exposed U.S. Marine
terrorism in Haiti and fought for the passage of the Dyer
Anti-Lynching Bill.
   Johnson served as consul in both Venezuela and Nicaragua, and
was the author of ``God's Trombones,'' ``The Autobiography of an
Ex-Colored Man,'' ``Along This Way'' and numerous other books and
articles.
   In January 1988, a postal stamp was issued in Johnson's memory
in a ceremony at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn., where he had
been a professor from 1930 until his death in 1938.
