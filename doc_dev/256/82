   When Marvin Young was dutifully doing
his economics homework two years ago at the University of Southern
California, he thought that after graduation he would settle down
to the 9-to-5 desk job grind.
   But somewhere along the line he became Young M.C.
   Today the rapper not only has an economics degree, he also has a
top-selling album and single, a pair of music awards and a
promotion deal with Pepsi.
   ``I didn't intend to get into the music business the way that I
did. It was just luck _ it was kind of fate _ that it happened,''
he said. ``I intended to go to college and get my degree, then get
a regular job and use that money to put out my records and then see
what happened from there.''
   In the past year, Young M.C. has won an American Music Award for
best new rap artist, and a Grammy Award for best rap performance
with the song ``Bust a Move.''
   His album, ``Stone Cold Rhymin','' has gone double platinum _
selling over 2 million copies. He also wrote the hit songs ``Wild
Thing'' and ``Funky Cold Medina'' for fellow rapper Tone Loc.
   And he recently made a deal with Pepsi to promote ``cool cans,''
stylized versions of the soft drink's traditional can, over the
summer.
   Not bad for someone who is just 22. However, Young M.C. hasn't
settled down in the music business just yet. He wants to use his
bachelor's degree in economics to go even further.
   ``Going out now and being Young M.C., and all the records and
the awards and whatever the case may be, it's good now for the way
I'm thinking, but in the future it also is a building block for me
to be a competent executive in the business,'' he said.
   Dressed in a black running suit before his recent Worcester
appearance with pop-duo Milli Vanilli, Young M.C. said his music is
purposely lighter than some other rap songs that have drawn
criticism for controversial lyrics.
   ``Bust a Move'' is a case in point. The song follows the
humorous path of boy meets girl _ almost.
   ``It's like, OK, a guy sees a girl and wants to talk to that
girl _ don't be shy, go up to her _ `Bust a Move.' It's just that
simple, instead of getting deep and graphic and all of that. To me
it's unnecessary.''
   Other rappers, most notaby groups such as N.W.A., Public Enemy
and 2 Live Crew, have come under fire for music that is fueled by
racial, social and sexual issues.
   ``It's not the subject matter. It's not the fact that people
will get on a record and say, `the government is unjust,' or `black
people are being mistreated,' because if you say it like that it's
not that offensive,'' Young said.
   ``But when you swear, or when you degrade other races, or
degrade women, or get violent and talk about killing people, that's
what is found offensive.''
   Young M.C. said he keeps controversy out of his lyrics because
of his fans, and he wants to establish an audience before he starts
voicing his opinions. ``The thing about it, to me, is that you go
at your own pace,'' he said. ``You don't beat people over the head
with the things you want to say. And you also don't say it in a way
to challenge or offend anybody.''
   Young M.C. was born in London but grew up in Queens, N.Y. By the
time he reached high school, he was already writing the songs that
would eventually make up about half of ``Stone Cold Rhymin'.''
   Then, two years ago, a single and somewhat unconventional
audition led Matt Dike and Mike Ross to sign Young M.C. to their
``Delicious Vinyl'' record label.
   ``I just rapped for them over the phone _ and they signed me. It
all happened really fast,'' he said.
   Since that fateful phone call, Young M.C. has become known as
something of a prodigy in the music business. He wrote ``Wild
Thing'' for Tone Loc in 35 minutes, and ``Funky Cold Medina'' in
under an hour. ``Bust a Move'' took a mere hour-and-a-half, and it
remained on Billboard magazine's hot 100 singles chart for more
than 40 weeks. And all of the writing took place while he was still
at USC.
   ``See, that's what happens when you're in college and you're
hungry and you're sick of professors and classes,'' he joked.
   Despite his Cinderella-like launch in the business, Young M.C.
is not about to turn into a pumpkin and fade into obscurity. He
says the same about his medium _ rap is here to stay, regardless of
the critics who believe it is a passing musical fad.
   ``There is no way it's going to die out. It's a young people's
music. It's just like how folk music was in the '60s,'' he said.
``You can get a lot more thoughts across with more words. And
there's a lot more words to a rap song than there is to a singing
song.''
   Now the pressure is on to make more hit records.
   But the fame hasn't gone to his head. If anything, it's made him
hungrier.
   ``When people talk to me and say `you've made it' or something
like that, I don't feel like I've made it. Two or three albums down
the line if I still have the same appeal I have now, then that's
what I'm talking about,'' he said.
   ``You have a lot of artists come out and they have great albums
for one year, then two or three years down the line you don't know
where they are.''
   In the meantime, Young M.C. is looking with amazement at his
sudden success. He never thought he'd achieve all this when he was
sitting at his dorm-room desk pondering figures and formulas.
   ``I was an economics major and now I'm rapping for a living'' he
said with a laugh. ``It doesn't seem to follow.''
