   Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, the man credited with
turning the Soviet Union into a modern naval power, died Friday at
age 78, Tass said.
   Gorshkov was appointed to head the Soviet navy in 1956 by Nikita
S. Khrushchev, who considered Josef Stalin's emphasis on large
surface vessels impractical because of their vulnerability to
rocket attacks.
   In the book ``Sea Power of the State,'' Gorshkov said the Soviet
navy's development of a fleet of submarines and missile-launching
warships had frustrated ``illusory hopes of imperialist aggressors
that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea they would have no
strong opponent.''
   Gorshkov was replaced in 1985.
