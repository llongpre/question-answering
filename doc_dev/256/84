   Onstage in ``Buddy'' on Broadway, Paul Hipp
looks like the earnest young rock 'n' roller he portrays, Buddy
Holly. Offstage, he comes across more like the brashly flippant,
facetious early Beatles.
   In his Manhattan apartment, which he shares with a West Highland
terrier named Dylan, he ignores a visitor who walks in while he's
listening intently to a Stevie Ray Vaughan record.
   Then he looks up to say, incongruously, ``I'm obsessed with Van
Gogh. I like Vincent. I was fantasizing about cutting my ear off
the other day but it'd take longer to do the makeup. Now all I have
to do is put base on and eyeliner.''
   Hipp, 25, who has a rock band of his own, was born six years
after Buddy Holly died at age 22 and seven years before Don McLean
wrote ``American Pie'' about the plane crash that killed him.
   But he identifies with Holly ``in the way he stuck with his own
sound and his own music. And he was a nice guy.''
   Hipp took up guitar at 12 and has studied both music and acting.
Until ``Buddy,'' he hasn't been famous, though he'd like to be,
with parallel careers. ``I see no reason why it has got to be actor
or musician,'' he says. ``I came up doing both. It's not like I'm a
rock 'n' roller slumming on Broadway.
   ``One of my main things I want to do is bridge the gap that
hasn't been bridged yet and have a serious career songwriting and
acting. Sting hasn't done it or David Bowie. Kris Kristofferson is
more country music.''
   Paul Hipp and the Heroes haven't cut any records yet, but he's
talking to record companies now. His acting in New York previously
hasn't been Broadway or off-Broadway but ``off-off-off-off.''
   ``I did a lot of plays nobody came to see,'' he says. ``This is
a nice change of pace for me. It's a wonderful thing to look out
and there's people sitting out there.''
   People in the Shubert Theater mezzanine and balcony are warned
that dancing and standing during the performance are prohibited,
but Hipp can see them dancing in the orchestra section's first few
rows.
   ``If there's a pretty girl up front, I can throw her a guitar
pick,'' he says. ``Then I have the crew go get her. When I come off
stage, the dressing room is filled with a bevy of beauties. The
next stop is the hot tub.''
   Despite the fact that he's starring in a musical, Hipp says, ``I
hate musicals. All that show business, people dancing, ain't my
thing.''
   Hipp's 20th-floor apartment on Central Park South is his first
New York apartment, he says. ``For nine years I couldn't afford
one. I lived wherever there was a couch. That's how Buddy Holly has
changed my life.''
   When he auditioned for ``Buddy'' in England, where he played the
role for nine months, he thinks he was chosen primarily for his
acting ability. ``But I'm sure the fact I can play guitar didn't
hurt.''
   Hipp was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award, which was won
by Jonathan Pryce in ``Miss Saigon.'' ``I thought it was fixed,''
he says. ``I don't know. It is fine to be nominated. It beats
playing Bleeker Street (in Greenwich Village) for 50 bucks a
night.''
   In ``Buddy,'' Hipp plays guitar and sings more than 20 Buddy
Holly songs, including ``That'll Be the Day,'' ``Peggy Sue'' and
``Oh Boy!''. He did a lot of research on the innovative pioneer
rocker from Lubbock, Texas, before he began portraying him.
   ``The show covers him from 19 to 22,'' Hipp says. ``He had the
natural growth any kid goes through. Add rock 'n' roll stardom, it
gets quite complicated. To internalize what had happened to him,
maintain that innocence and grow gradually was difficult.
   ``I met a lot of people who saw him on his last tour. Bob Dylan
saw him three days before he died, when he went through
Minnesota.''
   Act 2 of ``Buddy'' re-creates Buddy Holly's last concert, in
Clear Lake, Iowa, with Dion and the Belmonts, the Big Bopper and
Ritchie Valens. The latter two died on the plane with Holly later
that night.
   ``I wouldn't imagine anyone taped that show,'' Hipp says. ``I
would have run into them by now. The Buddy Holly Society knows more
about the Crickets (Holly's band) than the Crickets know about
themselves.''
   Holly's widow, who had a miscarriage after his death, saw
``Buddy'' in London and has been supportive, Hipp says.
   Hipp is the fourth of five children and uses his real name. He
moved to New York from Philadelphia right after graduating from
high school. ``The bell rang. I was here.
   ``I thought about changing my name to Rock Dashing,'' he says.
``I want to work on a soap opera really bad. I want to be Dr.
Dashing, have my teeth capped, plastic surgery, a square jaw, blond
hair and blue contacts.''
   Hipp played a Lower East Side punk in ``China Girl.'' During the
filming, he wrote the song ``Midnight for You.'' ``The director
liked it and put it in,'' Hipp says. Hipp and the Heroes played it.
   During the interview, Hipp strums on his guitar, which is
autographed by Johnny and June Cash, Duane Eddy, two Crickets and
Mrs. Holly.
   After ``Buddy'' and after his band cuts a record, Hipp hopes to
make a movie.
   ``It won't be music,'' he says. ``There won't be a guitar in
sight.''
