   ``Close-Up'' (Reprise) _ David Sanborn
   
   The latest offering from David Sanborn is a lot like his other
records _ melodic, upbeat and full of accomplished musicianship.
   But it's jazz for people who don't really like jazz.
   Where jazz is improvisational and daring, Sanborn is arranged
and methodical. Where jazz allows a musician ultimate freedoms from
written music, Sanborn and band are chained to the notes.
   On ``Close-Up,'' Sanborn and his band of crack sidemen plow
familiar ground. Sanborn is an outstanding, albeit unimaginative,
saxophonist, and the record is chock full of his full-steam-ahead
style and catchy hooks.
   He knows how to blow a good riff. On tunes such as ``Slam,''
``Pyramid'' and ``Touch,'' the band lays down a funky,
percussion-filled rhythm track that lets Sanborn pick out the
melody. The songs build to a climax that usually has the leader
hitting a high, solid note and then cascading down the keys.
   Sound familiar? See 1984's ``Straight to the Heart.''
   Other tunes show a glimpse of a slightly different Sanborn.
``Same Girl'' takes on a mournful quality as a duet between
saxophone and piano between Sanborn and Marcus Miller, who wrote or
co-wrote five songs on the record. ``J.T.'' also finds Sanborn in a
lyrical mood, as does ``So Far Away.''
   ``Close-Up'' is cleanly produced and includes such session men
as Nile Rodgers and ``Saturday Night Live'' guitarist G.E. Smith,
who most recently has been touring with Bob Dylan.
   Sanborn never misses a note, and his latest record makes
pleasurable listening. It makes one wish he'd take his considerable
ability out a bit further on the musical fringe.

   ``What A Wonderful World'' (Columbia) _ Willie Nelson
   
   You can pretty much tell from the titles what we're dealing with
here. This time out, Willie covers ``Spanish Eyes'' (with Julio
Iglesias, no less), ``Moon River,'' ``Some Enchanted Evening,''
``To Each His Own'' and six other Revered Standards.
   These songs are pretty, and Willie sings 'em pretty. If you
liked ``Stardust'' and ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' you'll like
this.
   But for those of us who fear that Willie is becoming the Mitch
Miller of the 1980s, who wonder what ever happened to the creator
of such classics as ``Crazy'' and ``Night Life'' _ his own classics
_ this collection is one more piece of evidence that Willie doesn't
work here anymore.

   ``Back To Avalon'' (Columbia) _ Kenny Loggins
   
   When he's on, Kenny Loggins is capable of creating impressive
pop music, the kind of hook-laden tunes that sound good on car
radios and stubbornly refuse to get out of your mind.
   When he's not, as for most of ``Back to Avalon,'' Loggins deals
in ordinary ``soft rock'' that really drags over an album's length.
   The news here is that ``Back to Avalon'' is Loggins' first album
in three years, during which time he has carved out a lucrative
sideline making hit songs for movie soundtracks.
   Not to go out on a limb too much, the new album includes two of
those cinema tracks _ the bouncy ``Nobody's Fool,'' a recent hit
from ``Caddyshack II,'' and the lush ``Meet Me Halfway'' from the
1987 Sylvester Stallone film, ``Over the Top.''
   Opening and closing the album, respectively, they are easily the
best songs. The rest of the LP flows from one mid-tempo rocker to
another, with breaks for the stately title track and a dance-floor
cover of the oldie ``Tell Her.''
   Loggins also has a visit from the ubiquitous Michael McDonald
for a vocal duet on ``She's Dangerous.'' You've heard this one, or
something like it, before.
   On ``Back to Avalon,'' Loggins sounds comfortable as a singles
artist but stretched to the limit when faced with the demands of an
LP.
