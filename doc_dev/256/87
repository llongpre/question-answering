   Betty Carter has been bopping around as a jazz
singer for 42 years, but she isn't tired of it.
   ``Performing live brings something out of you that the recording
studio doesn't,'' she says.
   In fact, her new album, ``Droppin' Things,'' on Verve Records,
was recorded live at the Bottom Line here on two nights in May. Her
last album, ``Look What I Got!'', won a Grammy Award for best
female jazz vocal performance in 1988.
   Carter, 60, feels it's important for a singer to work with new
material and not get locked into an unchanging repertoire.
   ```Why Him' is an Alan Jay Lerner song I heard when they were
giving him a tribute on TV. I decided to find the lyrics and do the
song,'' she said of her new album. ```Thirty Years' is a brand-new
song. `Droppin' Things' is very new. `Open the Door' I recorded
before but never like this.'' She wrote those three.
   One of the tracks on the album is ``Star Dust,'' combined with
``Memories of You.'' But, Carter said, ``I never sang `Star Dust'
before. I only sang `Memories' once or twice.''
   Carter is known for daring improvisations and unusual approaches
to songs. ``The more you do a song the more you learn about the
tune and your concept of the tune. Then I'm free; then I just go
any way I want to go and can go with it musically,'' she said.
   But she decided not to play around too much on the new album.
``At least you can recognize it,'' she said. ``Most people want to
recognize `Star Dust.'''
   Carter is backed up by Marc Cary on piano, Duane Burno on bass
and Gregory Hutchinson on drums. ``They're 20, 20 and 23,'' she
said. ``My musicians are getting younger and younger. Maybe 15
years ago I had a hard time finding musicians. Now there are a lot
of them out there who want to play acoustic instruments and work
with me.''
   They went to Japan in October, returned for some American gigs
in November and probably will spend much of next year in Europe.
``I love performing. I know how spontaneous it is for me to do my
work. Working keeps me alive,'' Carter said.
   A snatch of conversation overheard on the radio led her to
rework the lyrics for ``Jumps,'' a song she wrote 12 years ago. Her
trio liked ``Jumps,'' so when they went to Europe in March, she
worked on more lyrics.
   ``The music was very abstract,'' she said. ``Once these young
kids showed me their enthusiasm for the tune, I said OK, I'm going
to develop it. I'd tried it with other musicians; they shrugged
their shoulders. I find these kids, younger than my two sons, will
try anything.
   ``I start doodling at the piano in front of my trio. If they
say, `What's that?', I know it's time to develop the tune. I ask
them for their input also. It makes them part of the material,
which keeps it young and different.''
   Carter credits Wynton Marsalis with ``inspiring a lot of young
players to come out and take a chance. ''
   She said young performers are increasingly turning to material
``I thought I never would hear again, old Thelonious Monk, Charlie
Parker, Dizzy Gillespie tunes.'' But Carter doesn't want to keep
listening to those re-creations.
   ``I keep telling them, learn all the songs we played in those
days, know all the changes, lock it up in the brain and go for
something else. Sit and learn all the standards. They're
interesting. It's very educational to learn the blues in all kinds
of keys. Learn how to transpose.
   ``Don't listen too long to some one artist. Get in the habit of
being creative early, for the rest of your life. You could come up
with something different than anyone has ever done. It could
happen. There are 88 keys and all kinds of changes to experiment
with. A voice can do a lot of wonderful things.
   ``Only time is going to make young musicians understand what I'm
talking about. I wouldn't pay anybody any attention either in my
young age. At least they get some information in the very
beginning. Some that don't take advantage of it instantly will
catch it later.''
