   Rock star Prince won a legal battle today as
the Supreme Court refused to revive a copyright-infringement
lawsuit over his hit song ``U Got The Look.''
   The court, without comment, let stand decisions dismissing
claims by Prince's half-sister, Lorna Nelson of Minneapolis, Minn.,
that his song's lyrics are too similar to an unpublished song she
wrote.
   Ms. Nelson in 1987 sued Prince, whose full name is Prince Rogers
Nelson, and PRN Productions, his record business based in
Chanhassen, Minn.
   Her federal suit contended that the lyrics to ``U Got The Look''
infringed on her copyright in an unpublished song, ``What's Cooking
in this Book.''
   U.S. District Judge David S. Doty last year threw out Ms.
Nelson's suit, ruling that no substantial similarity existed
between the two song lyrics. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the dismissal last May 3.
   The case is Nelson vs. PRN Productions, 89-725.
