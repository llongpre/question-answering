   Marti Jones doesn't want to take over the whole
world, just a small part.
   ``I don't have that drive to want to be this huge superstar
because I'm just having fun doing what I'm doing,'' said Jones,
whose third album, ``Used Guitars,'' was released this summer.
   ``But I'd be stupid not to notice when people hear the record on
the radio, they go out and buy it. I can go to Washington, D.C.,
and play halls, fill 1,400-seat halls. Other places, with no
airplay, you get maybe 50 people saying `Who is she?'''
   Jones has slowly accumulated a following over the last few
years, earning praise for interprations of songs by John Hiatt and
Graham Parker, and for the original material created by herself and
producer Don Dixon.
   It's tempting to define Jones as a ``Critics' Choice,'' someone
who receives good reviews but doesn't sell many records. Jones
would like to be successful both artistically and commercially, not
just for herself, but for the songwriters she covers.
   That spirit came out this summer at a concert at the ``Bottom
Line'' in New York, when Jones brought out many of the songwriters
featured on ``Used Guitars.'' Those appearing included Hiatt,
Parker and the team of Janis Ian and Kye Fleming, who wrote two
songs on the new record.
   ``We had so much fun,'' Jones recalled. ``Everybody tossed their
egos out the door. Everybody rooted for everybody else. Nobody
complained about having enough time.
   ``Nobody got paid. We covered their expenses for traveling and
that was it. What a bunch of pals. It was just the whole spirit of
the thing. It was like `Dick Clark's Cavalcade of Stars.' Everybody
does their best five songs.''
   Jones, who still lives in her native Ohio, grew up in the 1960s
hearing a wide variety of music.
   ``My parents had Burl Ives and the Kingston Trio,'' she said.
``My sisters listened to Top 40, the Beatles, Temptations and
Supremes. Later, I went into the heavy Joni Mitchell scene, but at
the same time I'd take out a Jimi Hendrix record and put it on.''
   She began singing at an early age and idolized the late country
legend Patsy Cline. But Jones' own vocals can best be compared to
the British singer, Dusty Springfield.
   ``I started reading reviews and they kept saying, `Dusty
Springfield, Dusty Springfield.' and I thought, `What does she
sound like?' Dixon had this compilation of British hits and we
listened to it and I went, `They're right.' I'm really flattered.
She's a great singer. It was eerie.''
   Jones was in her first band, ``Color Me Gone,'' when she met
Dixon, now her husband and also producer of R.E.M.
   ``Somebody had the brilliant idea to re-record two of the six
songs on the album,'' she said, rolling her eyes. ``We had already
done them 20 million times in 20 million ways.
   ``They flew in Don Dixon as a candidate for a producer. I really
liked him. He was a nice guy. He had this attitude that nothing's a
big deal. Great attitude.''
   After Jones left the group, Dixon got in touch with her.
   ``He said, `I caught your name at the bottom of my drawer and I
always liked your singing, what are you planning on doing?' The
record label put the two of us together.''
   Jones credits Dixon with helping develop her own sound.
   ``I wasn't sure what my sound was as a singer because I had been
singing songs that were not really the kind I wanted to sing,''
Jones said.
   ``He helped me pick out songs and built my confidence up.''
   Jones' first album, ``Unsophisticated Time,'' came out in 1984
and has set the tone for her career so far: original songs and
covers; good reviews and poor sales.
   ``The record company didn't push the record. They thought it
sounded like a demo,'' she said.
   ``Match Game,'' released in 1986, continued the pattern. Jones
combined original songs with covers of Elvis Costello and Marshall
Crenshaw among others.
   ``Used Guitars'' has 11 songs, three of them Dixon-Jones
originals. The songs range from ``Ruby,'' a bluesy ballad written
by Ian and Fleming, to the mainstream pop of ``Tourist Town,'' a
Dixon-Jones composition.
   The creative process of ``covering'' a song can be compared to
an actor reading a script _ taking words written by someone else
and turning them into the artist's own personal experience.
   Jones isn't concerned about how many of her own songs are put on
each album. She believes in using the best material possible, no
matter who wrote it.
   ``Hopefully, people are opening up a little more to realizing a
song is a song and it doesn't matter if the person's who's singing
it, wrote it,'' she said. ``I could write an album's worth of
material in two weeks but I don't think it would be good enough.''
