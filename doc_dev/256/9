   Singer-songwriter Randy Vanwarmer is
counting on the emotional edge of his new album to stem a nine-year
slide since his million-selling hit ``Just When I Needed You Most.''
   The 33-year-old Vanwarmer has just released ``I Am,'' a
collection of soft country ballads with romantic titles such as ``I
Will Hold You,''``That's What Your Smile Does for Me'' and ``Words
I Never Meant.'' It's his first album in four years.
   ``There's something spiritual about the record,'' Vanwarmer said
in an interview. ``It's kind of like gathering your family around
the fireplace.''
   As a marketing exercise, however, it has been a disaster.
   Instead of Vanwarmer's ``It's a Heartache,'' a tune by pop-jazz
singer Michael Franks, ``The Camera Never Lies,'' was distributed
erroneously with Vanwarmer's name printed on it.
   The mistake was repeated during a second round of distribution,
so record company officials gave up on the song and will switch to
another one, ``Where the Rocky Mountains Touch the Morning Sun.''
   ``The radio stations kept calling and saying, `We like Randy's
record but he's not country enough for our station,''' Vanwarmer
said.
   ``His record is kind of jazz, funky, but we have similar
textured voices. I can almost understand why they almost thought it
was me.''
   His tough luck continues a pattern since his powerful ``Just
When I Needed You Most'' propelled him from obscurity in 1979.
   Instead of establishing himself as a ballad singer, he followed
up with an uptempo tune titled ``Gotta Get Out of Here.''
   ``It did terribly,'' Vanwarmer recalled.
   More than half a dozen singles were released subsequently, but
none was a hit. On the advice of others, he declined to do American
concert tours that would have built up his name and following. A
possible tour with Anne Murray was bypassed.
   Furthermore, his record company wound down, ``and I don't think
they were putting the money behind the records that they needed
to,'' he said.
   ``I don't blame anybody,'' he said about the downfall. ``Maybe
if I had been more knowledgeable. ...
   ``We had one solid record, and then we wanted to change
direction _ something with a little more edge. I wanted to do it;
that was just naivete. My first record seemed so easy. I do ballads
best. We could have done another ballad, but we put out an uptempo
thing.''
   Though he failed to capitalize on the success of ``Just When I
Needed You Most,'' he says his royalties from writing the hit paid
the bills for six years.
   His breakup with his girlfriend inspired the song.
   ``That was kind of devastating,'' he recalled. Six months later,
he sat down and put the song on paper.
   ``I found that those kind of songs, the deepest ones, come some
time after an event. You're too traumatized at the time. When
someone leaves, you just don't go sit down and write a song. If you
did, you'd almost wish bad things would happen to you.''
   He said the song was a hit because listeners related to a lament
over a broken romance. ``It's happened to everyone. That emotion is
universal. Some people like to feel sorry for themselves,'' he said.
   ``I always hoped the record wasn't wallowing in self pity and it
had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.''
   A footnote about the song is that John Sebastian of the rock
group Lovin' Spoonful played autoharp on the record.
   ``To me, it was one of the things that sold the record,''
Vanwarmer said.
   In 1980, he wrote the song ``It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes,''
which later became a No. 1 hit for the Oak Ridge Boys.
   The song, triggered by the death of his father 13 years earlier,
made its way to the charts in an unusual fashion. The song got into
the hands of Oak Ridge Boys' record producer Ron Chancey, whose
wife fell in love with it after hearing it on a demonstration tape.
It was then recorded by the group as a favor to her, Vanwarmer said.
   ``One perk of being a songwriter is exorcising your feelings as
they come along,'' he said. ``And people can exorcise theirs as
they listen too.''
   He wrote it on Christmas Eve as he sat alone at home before
gathering with family members.
   ``It was emotion from the heart. It wrote itself.''
