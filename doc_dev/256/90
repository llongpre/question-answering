BJORK'S idiosyncratic vocal style was one of the main reasons why Iceland's
contribution to rock music, the Sugarcubes, always remained something of an
acquired taste. Yet her first solo record, Debut, has proved a surprising
success. Its occasional jazzy tinge and off-centred lyrics about pained
love, together with the huge sales and Bjork's wonderful cheekbones, have
even drawn comparisons with Sade, even though their musical styles are
utterly different. Bjork is in grave danger of becoming the next thinking
man's rock crumpet; a fate she does not deserve.
Bjork's voice dominates Debut. She wrote all the songs and undoubtedly the
eclectic mixture of styles - techno, bebop, jazz ballad, reggae and Asian -
reflects her tastes. Even so, it is very much a producer's album, the styles
blended into a distinctive but consistent whole in the studio by Nellee
Hooper who previously produced Soul to Soul. Now here was Bjork onstage at
the Forum on Thursday night for the inevitable showcase concert with a six
piece band, most of whom had not played on the album and whose surnames, she
said afterwards, she did not know.
As a live show, the evening lacked shape or a sense of the dramatic. Bjork
ran through the songs from her album and, once she had played them, returned
only for the briefest encore. But as a display for those songs it was a
success. The inability of a live band, even one with so much technology, to
duplicate a sophisticated studio sound helped pick out the different
influences, highlight the contrasts between songs and emphasise the
muscularity of Bjork's more dance-influenced tunes.
'Human Behaviour' - the hit, the first track on Debut and the first song in
the show - was propelled by a slinky, club beat. 'Venus as a Boy' combined a
reggae bass line with flute and the Asian-textured violin of Nawaz Ali Khan.
On 'The Anchor Song' Bjork sings simply over jazz saxophone tootlings.
Hippyish curls and wisps of violin and flute or jazzy honks from saxophone
and clarinet gave a lighter texture to the powerful background of drums,
percussion, bass and keyboards.
Whatever the arrangements and however good the material, she lives by her
voice. It is certainly distinctive. At times it is almost gruff, at others
it floats up, sharp and penetrating. It is always fragile but has surprising
power, although there were times when the band threatened to crush it.
Yet Bjork's singing also has its weaknesses. 'Like Someone In Love' is
constructed and presented like a jazz ballad, sung over keyboards twiddled
to imitate jazz guitar. But her phrasing is strangely random, her grip on
the melody slippery at best; she does not seem to care, beating the song
breathlessly to a paste, with immense charm and personality. The crowd
received it with rapture.
Bjork's strengths were clear in the last song of the set 'Big Time
Sensuality', a knowing piece of faux soul, electro meets Stax. Bjork barked,
swooped and shouted over a braying saxophone and relentless rhythm; a
wonderful dance song, a climax to any live show. In front of her, the great
mass of the audience stood as if their feet had been superglued to the dance
floor, happily lost in Bjork's strange territory, drawn to this latest
dreamy, sub-poetic woman singer-song-writer.
At the Forum Kentish Town. Bjork supports U2 at Wembley today and plays at
Wolverhampton Civic Hall on September 13 and the Manchester Academy on
September 14.
