   Singer Lee Greenwood, who wrote the
patriotic song ``God Bless the USA,'' has performed at the White
House four times, and has become one of President Bush's favorite
entertainers.
   Greenwood, the Country Music Association's male vocalist of the
year in 1983 and 1984, was also a favorite of former President
Reagan. The singer's popularity at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue carried
over into the Bush administration. He spent Easter weekend with Bush
at Camp David.
   ``God Bless the USA'' was used extensively by Reagan during the
1984 presidential campaign. Greenwood also sang it at Bush campaign
appearances in the 1988 campaign, and also performed it at various
inauguration events.
   During his Easter weekend with Bush, Greenwood recalled seeing
some of the president's record collection.
   ``He has the Oak Ridge Boys, Loretta Lynn, I believe George
Strait and myself,'' he said. ``The tapes I saw at Camp David were
just those acts. I didn't see any others; there was nothing but
country music and just those selected artists.''
   The 1983 ``God Bless the USA'' salutes those who have died
defending the United States, and cites American pride.
   As a result of the song, Greenwood also has become a top act at
military bases. He has performed on four USO tours, including an
eight-day tour around the world with comedian Bob Hope in 1987. At
the request of the White House, Greenwood will do another one this
Christmas.
   Greenwood, a native of Los Angeles, was born to parents who split
up when he was a year old. He was raised by his grandparents on a
small chicken farm near Sacramento, Calif., and was a member of the
rock 'n' roll group the Young Rascals before they became famous.
   He spent about 10 years as a casino dealer and performer in Las
Vegas until becoming a country music star in the early 1980s.
   ``I was raised without much money,'' the 46-year-old singer said
in an interview at his Nashville office. ``To raise to the height of
being honored at the residence of the head of state says a lot for
this country and the system. It's a great honor for me.''
   ``I'm lucky, I guess,'' he said. ``It says a lot about America to
be able to work into that position.''
   His other hit records include ``IOU,'' ``Dixie Road,'' ``You've
Got a Good Love Coming,'' ``It Turns Me Inside Out'' and ``Ring on
Her Finger, Time on Her Hands.''
   Blessed with a husky voice and driving ambition, he won a Grammy
award for ``IOU.'' ``God Bless the USA'' was voted song of the year
by the CMA in 1985.
   Greenwood said ``God Bless the USA'' has outpaced other aspects
of his career. Reagan once said the song ``lifted the spirit of
America to a new place it had never been before.''
   ``It stands so high above everything else I've done,'' Greenwood
said. ``It is a powerful piece of material and it's almost
impossible for me to do a show without it. We're a very difficult
act to follow just because of that piece of material.''
   Earlier this year, he issued a revised version, ``God Bless
Canada,'' changing the lyrics to salute Canada. Larry Gatlin and the
Gatlin Brothers, three of his country music counterparts, sang
harmony.
   Greenwood, looking to expand his career further, is now turning
to movies. He plans to be involved in three motion pictures, acting
in two and writing songs for all three. The first is ``Stranglehold:
Delta Force II,'' starring Chuck Norris. The other two are a Civil
War movie and a film about the Vietnam war. He said he will have
limited roles in the last two.
   ``I'm under no pressure to be a great actor,'' Greenwood said.
