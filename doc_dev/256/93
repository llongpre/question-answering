   Flamboyant William Lee Golden, voted out
of the Oak Ridge Boys' country quartet last year, has a fresh
career singing with his two sons in the new group, the Goldens.
   He has been performing this year with Rusty, 29, and Chris, 25,
in the aftermath of his well-publicized ouster from the Oak Ridge
Boys after 22 years.
   During Golden's 22 years with the group, it won five Grammy
awards. The Oak Ridge Boys are best known for their hits
``Elvira,'' which sold 2 million, and ``Bobbie Sue,'' which sold 1
million.
   Joining his sons has a special significance for Golden, who sang
lead on one of the Oak Ridge Boys' many hits, ``Thank God for
Kids.''
   ``I've learned about music and their youthful enthusiasm,'' the
49-year-old Golden said. ``We go to concerts together and study
what's happening in the music business. When I hear someone on the
radio I don't know, I ask them, `Who is that.' They usually know
and seem attuned to what's going on.''
   The other three members of the Oak Ridge Boys replaced Golden in
1987 because of personal and musical differences. His successor was
former child actor, Steve Sanders, who had played rhythm guitar in
their band for five years.
   Golden, who stood out because of his waist-length hair and
flowing beard, recently talked about his ouster.
   ``I could see the writing on the wall for a while,'' he said.
``When it came down, at first I laughed at how it was handled, then
I got mad. It hit all the emotions. Because after all those years,
22 years, it was sad to think that it had come down to the end the
way it did.
   ``My emotions went in all directions,'' he said. ``They can
still get in a lot of different directions. It takes a team to do
what we did and I still believe in harmony and try to teach harmony
to my family.
   ``Some days you disagree, but a family is forgiving. I'm not
perfect either; I have my faults. I've been guilty of having too
much fun.
   ``I sang harmony every way I could with them. I was there for 22
years and was a dedicated team player. I guess all my time and
energy can be looked upon as a certain phase of my life now. Now,
I'd rather help my family with guidance and assistance.''
   It was the group's first personnel change in 10 years.
   A year before his ouster, Golden recorded an album on his own,
``American Vagabond.''
   ``I was getting frustrated because I had music inside me,''
Golden said. ``That's why I did the solo album. They didn't want me
to do it and wouldn't allow me to sing songs from that album on
stage as the Oak Ridge Boys.''
   After being voted out, Golden filed a $40 million lawsuit
against the group, seeking $10 million in general damages and $30
million in punitive damages.
   But Golden says feelings are mellowing among the four. Lawyers
have been working to settle the lawsuit out of court.
   The Oak Ridge Boys attended a Nashville concert by the Goldens
in early June.
   ``I respect that,'' Golden said.
   ``We speak when we're around each other,'' he added. ``There's
no need in me holding a grudge if we can settle our differences.''
   The Goldens and the Oak Ridge Boys have the same booking agency
and this has led to speculation the two groups may work together.
   ``There's been talk of joining forces and we'll see what would
happen. It's just talk. At least we're talking.''
   Golden is not the only Oak Ridge Boy connection to the Goldens.
Two members of the Goldens' band formerly played in the Oak Ridge
Boys' band.
   The Oak Ridge Boys, a former gospel music group, have continued
to do well without Golden. The quartet recently was voted favorite
group in a poll of viewers by The Nashville Network cable channel.
   ``From what I read, they are happy and doing what they've wanted
for a long time,'' Golden said. ``They seem happy, so that's good.''
   Golden, a native of Brewton, Ala., said he's had to take a
higher profile since teaming with his sons.
   ``The adjustment has been to come out of the shadows to where
I'm singing lead on each song and keep it moving from song to song.
I sing more and I'm singing better. The more I sing, the better I
am. Singing is physical and emotional.''
   Golden said he's reluctant to sing ``Elvira'' any more.
   ``I just sang harmony on the chorus (with the Oak Ridge Boys).
It's a good song but I would feel funny singing it now. I enjoyed
singing it when we did it.''
