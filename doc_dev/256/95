   Fans of the Go-Go's will recognize the catchy
pop music on Jane Wiedlin's new album, ``Fur.'' They may be
surprised, however, to hear what she has to say.
   ``This is not any easy life, it's hard to hang on to hope,''
Wiedlin sings on ``Inside a Dream,'' the first single. ``There's so
many things need to change. Well, I wonder how we cope.''
   ``The world's a really crummy place, but we can't give up
because we know that,'' Wiedlin said. ``We have to keep fighting to
improve things.''
   Wiedlin was the rhythm guitarist for the Go-Go's, an all-female
band whose debut album, ``Beauty and the Beat,'' went No. 1 in
1982. Their videos presented an image of five cheerful, carefree
young women.
   ``The Go-Go's were always perceived as being upbeat but there
was a lot of suffering as well,'' Wiedlin said.
   ``Fur'' is Wiedlin's second solo record. Anyone familiar with
Go-Go's songs such as ``Our Lips Are Sealed'' and ``Head Over
Heels'' may not be prepared for the more serious mood of ``Inside a
Dream,'' but Wiedlin is not concerned.
   ``I've learned a lesson because of the Go-Go's, and that's not
to worry about how people see me,'' she said in an interview.
   Wiedlin has become more politically active since leaving the
Go-Go's in 1984. On her first solo LP, she included postcards to be
sent to President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
urging them to dismantle nuclear arms. She became a vegetarian five
years ago and has campaigned actively for animal rights.
   ``The Go-Gos's were a combination. It's just me and my
personality now and my ideas,'' Wiedlin said. ``I've been more
outspoken on world events and animal rights and so forth.''
   The title song on ``Fur'' is a direct plea not to wear aninal
furs.
   ``I wore a fur coat in the band and it really never occurred to
me, the violence behind it,'' Wiedlin recalled. ``When I see people
wearing fur, they overlook the violence. I want people to connect
fur coats with animals.
   ``I just feel that people should take more responsibility for
their actions.''
   ``Fur'' was Wiedlin's favorite song on the album.
   ``I'm most proud of `Fur' because it's real difficult to write a
song about social issues without sounding preachy or
holier-than-thou,'' she said. ``I've been trying to do that for
years.''
   Wiedlin co-wrote all the songs on ``Fur.'' At the suggestion of
her record label, EMI-Manhattan, she used several different
partners, including Regina Cole, who wrote ``Baby Love'' for
Regina, and Peter Rafelson and Garder Cole, who have worked with
Madonna.
   ``I went with this idea,'' Wiedlin said. ``I don't like writing
by myself anymore. Working with someone, you can talk about
things.''
   Wiedlin has tried to simplify her songwriting style over the
years.
   ``I've become more interested in the way words sound, rather
than their meaning. The idea behind the words is what's most
important.''
   The album was produced by Stephen Hague, who had worked on the
hits ``West End Girls'' and ``What Have I Done to Deserve This?''
for the Pet Shop Boys. Wiedlin said Hague was her ``one and only
choice'' for ``Fur.''
   ``I'd heard a demo that had four or five different bands on it
and every band sounded great,'' she said. ``I had never heard a
producer whose work sounded so consistently good.
   ``He brought this feeling of coherence to the album. He gave it
such a strong sound; it was almost like a concept album.''
   While the recording of ``Fur'' went smoothly, taking only 28
days, Wiedlin disagreed with her record label over the order of
songs. The company wanted to put all the potential singles on one
side and end the record with ``The End of Love,'' which she
considered too depressing. She wanted to end with the more
optomistic ``Whatever It Takes,'' which the label wanted to release
as a single.
   Wiedlin won out but admitted, ``We duked it out on that one.''
   Although her first solo record sold poorly, she's confident
she'll attract a following.
   ``I think that it's slowly building. I'm not very worried about
that,'' Wiedlin said. ``The basis of my following are people that
loved the Go-Go's. That's a hardcore group of people.''
   Wiedlin wants to tour before the end of the year and hopes her
music will get people more involved in social causes.
   ``It has the ability to change things. I get letters from fans
that say they're really proud of me,'' she said. ``I'm trying to
help the animals. Getting even just one fan to help is enough.
   ``I like to encourage people to be active in social change and
trying to improve the world. I've been able to become more active
and more outspoken about my beliefs.''
