   When The Beatles released their classic ``Sgt.
Pepper'' album in the summer of 1967, Joe Jackson wasn't paying
attention; he was too busy learning Beethoven.
   By the album's 20th anniversary, however, Jackson was an
established rock star, preparing material for his next record.
   All the talk about ``Sgt. Pepper'' got him thinking about his own
life over the past two decades.
   He was born in 1955 in Portsmouth, England, and taught himself
classical piano, later attending the Royal Academy of Music. By the
late 1970s, he was one of many young musicians inspired by the punk
movement and released a pair of hard-edged, satiric albums, ``Look
Sharp'' and ``I'm the Man.''
   ``When I wrote those `Look Sharp' songs,'' Jackson recalled, ``I
was 21, 22, and very inspired by early punk. I wanted to strip
everything down to the basics and make some high energy music,
guitar, bass and drums. I was trying to write decent songs at the
same time, not just trash.''
   But Jackson wanted to record in a variety of styles. He released
an album of '40s blues and swing, ``Jumpin' Jive,'' and used
shadings of jazz and salsa on ``Body and Soul'' and ``Night and
Day.''
   ``It's becoming more and more apparant that we have something
here that doesn't have to be governed by any rules,'' he said. ``We
can do what we like with that. There's a lot of things about rock
'n' roll other than youth and rebellion and being 19 and looking
cool.''
   Jackson ended up writing 12 songs for his new album, ``Blaze of
Glory,'' a collection of rockers and ballads that has the orchestral
feel of ``Sgt. Pepper,'' and serves musically and lyrically as a
miniautobiography.
   He starts the record with the wide-eyed ``Big New World,'' in
which a young boy imagines an unlimited future.
   ``I sort of grew up reading science fiction comic books,'' the
34-year-old Jackson recalled. ``We were watching the moon landing on
TV and thinking it was all going to come true.''
   Eleven songs and 20 years later, Jackson is ready to settle for
simpler pleasures with ``The Human Touch.'' Dreams of conquering the
world have given way to a simple wish for intimacy.
   ``You have to adjust,'' Jackson said. ``Everything is going to
change as you get older and you have to constantly adjust.
Unfortunately, we have such a youth-obsessed culture that people
can't see the positive side of that. ''
   In between, Jackson sings of youth culture (``Rant and Rave,''
``Nineteen Forever''), the superpowers (``Evil Empire'') and a
London that no longer swings (``Down to London'').
   The music combines rock, pop, jazz and swing.
   ``You hear a certain lack of consensus, now _ a lack of style of
the times,'' he said. ``There are no rules. There's no such thing as
rock 'n' roll or pop music anymore; there are a zillion different
kinds of music.
   Jackson has matured as a singer as well. His vocals on ``Blaze of
Glory'' are relaxed and light, in contrast to his earlier records,
where he affects a harsh tone.
   ``I didn't realize you could actually hold back a bit and still
be OK,'' he said. ``You just sort of got up and screamed your lungs
out because it was going to be exciting and you were going to show
everyone you meant it. You realize there are other ways of doing
it.''
   He sings of rock stars who died young, such as Buddy Holly and
Eddie Cochran, on the title track, and uses lyrics from classic
songs _ Buffalo Springfield's ``For What It's Worth,'' The Who's
``Won't Get Fooled Again'' _ throughout the record.
   ``I don't think it's silly at all to still like those songs,''
Jackson said. ``The only thing silly to me is people who think it's
the same way, trying to depend that 20 years haven't gone by.''
   ``Sgt. Pepper'' was the first rock album referred to widely as
art, a dangerous term for music that began as rebellion against
pretension and snobbery. Jackson sees it as a positive development.
   ``I think that comes from people having the wrong idea about art
rather than the wrong idea of rock 'n' roll. There's nothing elitist
or pretentious about art. Tha arts in the 20th century have been a
process of democratization _cinema, jazz and rock 'n' roll.
   ``You can call it what you like, but there's no doubt in my mind
that what I'm doing is art and I'm an artist. Of course I'm an
artist. What am I going to say, I'm a plumber?''
