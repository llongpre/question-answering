   Jerry Jeff Walker walked onto the small
stage at Gruene Hall, slung the exotic reptile skin strap of his
Martin guitar over his shoulder and signaled to the band he was
ready to start.
   To the resounding applause of 600 people at the rustic,
wood-floor honky-tonk, he picked and crooned one country tune after
another, talking to the crowd in between instrumental solos as if he
were talking to old friends.
   At the chorus of one tune, the 46-year-old Walker reminded his
audience he had matured just a bit: He was once regarded as a hard
drinking, cussing rebel both on and off the stage who couldn't care
less for the business end of his career.
   ``We're just here to play a little music, not watch me throw up.
... I've already done that ... before,'' he said to ear-piercing
hoots and hollers in the 110-year-old dance hall where burlap sacks
hung from the rafters and newspaper ads adorned the walls.
   The recent performance was another success. It also was an
inspiration for Walker, who recorded his first album in three years
and his first live one in 10 years at the hall.
   ``I've been playing here for years and we've had fun here,''
Walker said in an interview. ``I usually record live anyway in the
studio and I got some songs that I wanted some people to sing along
on and I wanted to get the audience to join in.
   ``We're living in a very high-tech era with mechanical drums and
other things. I thought it would be fun to make a live album with
just regular ol' musicians playing music.''
   During his two decades in the music business, Walker has played
to thousands at concert halls and to a few fans and friends at dimly
lighted bars in the middle of nowhere.
   Gruene _ pronounced Green _ is about a third of the way to
Austin, where Walker lives with his wife and two children.
   Walker, who recorded the live ``Viva Terlingua'' album in the
once-unknown Hill Country hamlet of Luckenbach, believes Gruene's
small-town flavor was just right for him and his fans for the new
album.
   ``It's more of a treat for people to come here. They can put on
their Levi's, come out in their pickup truck, bring along some beer
and come out and be heard,'' he said.
   The Oneonta, N.Y., native wrote such songs as ``Drifting Way of
Life,'' ``Gypsy Songman,'' ``Hill Country Rain'' and ``Cadillac
Cowboy.''
   But he is best known for ``Mr. Bojangles,'' a song about a
raggedy old man who danced a soft shoe for money. Walker wrote the
tune during his wild days in 1968 but it remains popular and has
been recorded by such artists as Nina Simone.
   ``I still think it's part of everything,'' Walker said. ``I think
people in show business have identified with that song and that's
what's kept it around.''
   Time and a family have changed Walker some, but the rebel is
still within him. He has shed his reputation as a boozer who played
drunk at recordings and concerts. He has an occasional beer or two,
but he spends most of his time writing songs, jogging and playing
golf.
   Gone, too, from Walker's life are the entourages that followed
him around the country. He's a solo act now, but in Austin he knows
he easily can get together a few musicians to play anytime he wants,
as was the case with the live album. But the independent soul within
him refuses to let others dictate how he should write, play or
market his music.
   He's using his own money for the album and it will be released on
his Tried and True label. Susan Walker, 40, his wife of 14 years who
also serves as his business manager and president of an official fan
club, is working out a distribution deal.
   ``I think I've shown other song writers or singers that it's OK
to be a little bit out of what the mainstream is at the time,''
Walker said.
   ``I'm just a happy-go-lucky-kind of a guy that just traveled with
a guitar, played music and never did mind sleeping in the rain,'' he
said, adding that given another chance, he would do it all the same.
   ``I'm a character who lives in the song. I can write about my
life. I can get to sing my memories every night and that's pretty
fortunate. I'm pretty happy with my life. I played the music I
wanted to play and the people that liked it, liked it, and those who
didn't, well, they're probably better off anyway.''
   Though Walker's attitude about fans has at times been perceived
as flippant, he and his wife insist he does care.
   ``I think it's great the fans stayed there and I think my wife,
Susan, getting involved in the business end of my thing has really
helped my fans and me keep in touch with ourselves,'' he said.
   Among those fans is Chris Wall, a 38-year-old Wilsall, Mont.,
singer-songwriter who relocated to Austin to open up shows for
Walker and to be managed by Susan Walker.
   Walker planned to record at least two of Wall's songs on the new
album, including ``Trashy Women,'' and ``I Feel Like Hanks Williams
Tonight.''
   ``I liked Jerry Jeff because of the caliber of songs he was
singing back in the mid-'70s,'' Wall said. ``He was that rebel,
outlaw kind of guy and I think that's what I really liked about him.
   ``He's not what I expected now. He's pretty mellow and we're
pretty good friends. I wonder what he would have been like back then
and I wonder if I would have even been around with him back then.''
   Wall, who hopes Walker can popularize his songs, believes Walker
will be able to revitalize himself with the new album.
   ``This is important to the fans and they all want to be part of
history, just like `Viva Terlingua' in Luckenbach,'' Wall said.
``Not that he needs it or maybe not even want it, but this will
probably put Jerry back where he belongs.''
   For Wall and other struggling artists, Gruene has become a place
for debuts. After Walker's recording, the small community _ with a
bed-and-breakfast, a couple of restaurants and several antique shops
_ may be bustling like Luckenbach did after Walker, Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings and others popularized it in music.
