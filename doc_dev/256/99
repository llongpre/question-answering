   Marriage, fatherhood and his work with Live Aid
have changed Midge Ure. The evidence is in his latest album,
``Answers to Nothing.''
   ``The last few years have changed my life,'' said Scottish-born
Ure, 35. ``I think about more serious things now. Being a father,
I'm more concerned about the world my daughter will grow up in, so
that comes out in the songs I write.'' Songs on the album include
``Take Me Home,'' ``Sister and Brother'' and his latest single,
``Dear God.''
   The new material is spare, low-key and focused around his guitar
_ a radical departure from the synthesized orchestration of
Ultravox, his former group.
   ``Dear God'' was inspired by a pop magazine that asked him to
list his Christmas wish. The song asks God for ``love for the
lonely, food for the hungry and peace in a restless world.''
   The lyrics sum up Ure's status as one of the outstanding pop
artists who have put rock in the service of good causes _ the Band
Aid hit single ``Do They Know It's Christmas,'' the Live Aid concert
extravaganza for African famine relief and most recently the London
birthday rockfest for South Africa's jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela.
   Ure got into charity work with the Prince's Trust, Prince
Charles' organization which helps young unemployed people. But he is
best remembered for his work with Bob Geldof raising funds for
Ethiopian famine victims.
   ``He thought we should write a Christmas record, but we were only
a month away from Christmas at the time,'' Ure said in an interview
at his London record company office.
   The result was ``Do They Know It's Christmas.'' Geldof wrote the
lyrics and organized the performers, while Ure wrote the music. The
1984 record and the July 1985 Live Aid concert in London and
Philadelphia raised more than $110 million.
   However, since this summer's Mandela concert he has devoted
himself to family life with his wife, Annabel, and their
18-month-old daughter, Molly.
   ``There are a lot of great causes, but I don't think a concert is
always the answer,'' Ure said. ``People begin to think you're doing
it for the attention. You can't expect the music industry to keep
doing it, and the public gets tired of it as well.''
   Following Live Aid, Ultravox released its final album. ``I
realized at that time that my heart just wasn't in the band,'' Ure
said. ``To make a band work, you have to compromise. I didn't want
to become a dictator and tell everyone what to do, so I just bowed
out. Then everyone else decided not to carry on.''
   The new album, he insists, is more true to himself.
   ``A lot of Ultravox's vast pomposity wasn't me _ all that
overblown synthesizer stuff and massive orchestration. I'm a
guitarist, so this is more what I want.''
   With a wife and child to support, he's more aware of having to
make a living from music.
   ``It would be nice to have the sort of ideals where you don't
care if you sell records. But the unfortunate truth is, if you don't
sell any, your record company drops you and you don't get to make
any more records,'' he said.
   ``There's a fine line between commercial success and musical
success. I've been fortunate in that I've never had to compromise
one for the other. I'm artistically fulfilled, and people still seem
to want to buy my records.''
   While Ure said he missed the camaraderie of a group, working
alone allows him to keep his own schedule. ``I couldn't keep a
schedule like I used to _ working from midday to midnight. I like to
spend time with my daughter now.''
   The one love song on the LP, ``Just for You,'' is about his
daughter.
   ``Being a father is fantastic,'' Ure said. ``Getting your hands
dirty changing nappies (diapers) and all. ... It brings you right
back down to Earth with a bang.''
   Ure agreed that his experiences over the last few years have made
his latest album more mature. ``I followed my own ideas to their
ultimate conclusions in the songs. They are more mature, because my
worries are different than they used to be. I think I must be going
through male menopause. I'm only 35, but I feel like I'm 60.''
