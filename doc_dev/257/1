   A 60,000-year-old Neanderthal neck bone
resembles its counterpart in modern humans, suggesting the ancient
creatures were anatomically equipped to speak, researchers reported
today.
   Scientists are interested in the Neanderthal's capability for
those sounds because it bears on the question of whether
Neanderthals were direct ancestors of modern man or simply an
evolutionary dead end.
   The discovery of the tiny, U-shaped bone is reported in the
British journal Nature by reseael, France and
Moorhead State University in Minrchers from Isranesota.
   Other scientists said the find is unlikely to end the debate
about Neanderthal speech capabilities.
   The Neanderthals, who lived in Europe and Asia until about
35,000 years ago, undoubtedly did communicate in some fashion
because their culture was relatively advanced, scientists say. The
debate is whether they were physically able to speak.
   The new fossil, unearthed from Kebara Cave at Mount Carmel in
Israel, is a hyoid bone. In the body, the hyoid lies between the
root of the tongue and the larynx.
   In the Nature paper, the researchers said the fossil bone is
almost identical in size and shape to modern hyoids. Along with
other evidence, that suggests that that the larynx, or voice box,
also he
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
   Secondly, he said he does not see how the isolated bone will
help scientists determine the position of the larynx in the throat.
He called that crucial to the question of Neanderthal's speech
capabilities.
   The larynx is lower in the throat of modern humans than it was
in very early ancestors, he said. The lower position allows for the
space above it to act as a resonating chamber, which is required
for fully articulate speech, he said.
   In an editorial accompanying the Nature paper, John Marshall of
the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford, England, cautioned that
determining function from anatomy is tricky.
   The argument about Neanderthal language capability, he wrote,
``will undoubtedly run and run until we discover a deep-frozen
Neanderthal who is susceptible to resuscitation.''
   A second report in Nature confirms an earlier study that
suggested anatomically modern humans lived in the Middle East some
90,000 years ago. That was more than twice the age scientists had
been able to establish reliably for the existence of anatomically
modern humans.
   Scientists from Britain, Canada and Israel studied the age of
cattle teeth associated with human remains in the Skhul cave at
Mount Carmel. They found that the teeth, and so the humans, are at
least about 81,000 years old and more probably about 101,000 years
old.
   That resembles the age of about 92,000 years reported last year
for similar humans in the Qafzeh cave in Israel.
   Anatomically modern humans may have occupied the area only
intermittently during that era, study co-author Christopher
Stringer said in an interview.
   Neanderthals probably were more established there, but it is not
clear whether they encountered the anatomically modern humans, said
Stringer, curator of fossil hominids at the British Museum (Natural
History) in London.
