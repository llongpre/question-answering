   The human capacity for language may come
from a genetic mutation that occurred in a woman who lived in Africa
about 200,000 years ago, a researcher said Sunday.
   Her descendants went on to colonize Europe and Asia, perhaps
aided by an ability to speak that had not yet appeared in humans in
those areas, said Allan C. Wilson, a biochemist at the University of
California, Berkeley.
   Wilson's intriguing speculations about language are based on
exhaustive comparisons of genetic material from people around the
world.
   Two years ago, Wilson attracted the interest of scientists and
the public when he concluded that all humans are descendants of a
woman in Africa, who was inevitably dubbed ``Eve.''
   Wilson disdains that name for her, because he notes that she was
not the only woman alive at the time. Many others lived at the same
time; their descendants, as it happened, did not survive, he said.
   In a talk at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, Wilson said new evidence, including comparisons of human
genetic materials with that of chimpanzees and apes, strongly
confirm that finding.
   That assertion was strongly criticized by some anthropologists,
including Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan, who said
evidence from fossils ``clearly and unambiguously contradicts'' it.
   To buttress his theory, Wilson puzzled over what might have
caused early humans in Asia and Europe to have died out, leaving no
descendants today.
   He then became aware of research by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and
colleagues at Stanford University that suggested that language
emerged about the same time as modern humans evolved in Africa.
   That led to the suggestion that Eve and her African descendants
could speak, and their counterparts in Asia and Europe could not.
   ``It's likely they (the Europeans and Asians) could hear and make
sounds, but they didn't have modern language,'' Wilson said.
   But why didn't the Africans, who colonized Europe and Asia, mate
with Europeans and Asians, producing offspring who could speak and
who would have continued the European and Asian line of descendants
until today?
   Wilson proposed that the mutation that somehow made language
possible arose in a kind of genetic material called mitochondrial
DNA that is passed on only by mothers.
   As Africans invaded Europe and Asia, only the children of African
mothers would be able to speak, and the African men would, as
colonizers, likely prevent the African women from mixing with Asian
and European men.
   Any mixing between African men and European or Asian women would
result in mute children, because only African mothers could pass on
the language trait.
   The advantages of being able to communicate ultimately may have
enabled the Africans to overrun the mute Europeans and Asians,
Wilson said.
   Wilson admitted that this is a speculative notion. This
hypothesis is likely to inflame once again the controversy that
erupted after he advanced the notion of an ``Eve'' who was the
mother of humankind.
