<LEADPARA>  From sediments of a Stone Age lake bed in northwestern Greece, an
archaeologist has uncovered a flint hand ax made by a human ancestor who lived
between 200,000 and 500,000 years ago.;    Scientists say it is the earliest
firm evidence of a species of early humans in the Greek peninsula.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The discovery, announced Wednesday by Boston University, could open a new
window on the prehistory of Greece and the time of transition in human
evolution from Homo erectus, which presumably arrived in Europe from Africa
and the Middle East a million years ago, to antecedents to the Neanderthals
and modern Homo sapiens.;    Dr. James R. Wiseman, chairman of the archaeology
department at Boston University and leader of the expedition, called it "the
most significant discovery for the early prehistory of Greece in some 30
years.";    Dr. Curtis Runnels, the archaeologist at the university who found
the 9-inch-long ax, said in a telephone interview, "I think we've really
struck pay dirt with this one.";    Runnels and other members of the
expedition, which returned from Greece this week, said the sediments were rich
in artifacts from the Lower Paleolithic period, or early Stone Age.;    The ax
is of a type known as Acheulan, named for the site in France where it was
first discovered, and is associated with ancestors of modern humans.;    The
discovery was made in the region of the ancient city of Nikopolis, which the
Roman emperor Augustus founded in 29 B.C. to commemorate his victory over
Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium. The city was established near
the site of the naval engagement off Cape Actium at the entrance to the
Ambracian Gulf.;    The expedition, sponsored by the American School of
Classical Studies in Athens and known as the Nikopolis Project, has completed
its first season of field work.;    Geologists are having trouble determining
more precisely the age of the ax because they have yet to find any datable
organic material in the sediment.  </TEXT>
