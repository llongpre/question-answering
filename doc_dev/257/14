   A humanlike creature that became extinct more
than a million years ago was not ``all thumbs'' after all, a
scientist claims in a study published today.
   In fact, says Randall L. Susman of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, the small-brained hominid called Paranthropus
robustus had fingers and thumbs that were easily capable of turning
bones and rocks into tools during the era almost 2 million years
ago that the ancestors of modern humans were evolving the same
skills.
   Susman, an expert in primate anatomy, said most experts on early
humanlike animals believe that only the genus Homo, the ancestors
of modern humans, could make tools. But after examining fossils
unearthed in South Africa, Susman said he believes that
Paranthropus robustus also was a toolmaker and, in fact, could have
taught our ancestors this skill.
   Paranthropus robustus apparently emerged in Africa about 2.5
million years ago. The species did not evolve further, as did the
ancestors of mankind, and became extinct about 1.4 million years
ago. Susman said many experts have long believed that one reason
this large-toothed creature became extinct was that it could not
use tools.
   The experts, says Susman, were not giving proper credit to the
skills and dexterity of Paranthropus robustus. The proof, he said,
is in the thumb.
   Fossils dug up at Swartkrans in South Africa and dated from
about 1.8 million years ago show that Paranthropus robustus had a
very human-like thumb, said Susman.
   The Paranthropus thumb, like the human hand, was capable of
``precision grasping,'' and not just the ``power grasping'' of the
lower primates, he said.
   ``Precision grasping and power grasping require two different
types of anatomy,'' said Susman. Power grasping is the type used
when lifting a heavy suitcase or when doing a chin up. The fingers
become a hook-like grip and the thumb is just tucked out of the way.
   ``Precision grasp is the way you would pick up a raisin or the
way you would thread a needle,'' said Susman. ``Precision grasp
requires pulp to pulp contact between thumb and index finger. Power
grasp doesn't. When we look at hand anatomy ... we can see that
humans have unmistakable hallmarks of precision grasp.''
   So did Paranthropus, according to Susman.
   The fossils show that the Paranthropus thumb was connected to a
``saddle joint'' that was able to direct the thumb around to touch
the pads on each of the finger tips. It is a skill that only humans
have.
   ``A chimpanzee cannot rotate its thumb around,'' said Susman.
``When it picks up a grape, it does it in the same way that we
would turn a key in a lock _ a pinch of the thumb against the side
of the index finger.''
   Because of this finding, Susman believes the popular belief
about Paranthropus robustus _ that it died out because it could not
make tools _ is wrong.
   ``The explanation why Paranthropus became extinct is probably
more subtle and complicated than we think,'' said Susman. ``It is
possible that some environmental change took place and the
Paranthropus was not able to adapt'' as well as the larger-brained
Homo genus.
   Susman said tools have been found with the fossils of
Paranthropus robustus in African digs where there are no remains
from the Homo genus. At the Swartkrans dig, however, about 10
percent of the fossils have been identified as from the Homo genus.
Susman believes that the tools found there have the best chance of
being made and used by Paranthropus robustus, which makes up about
90 percent of the humanlike fossils found on the site.
   These fossils were unearthed about five years ago and Susman is
the first anatomy expert to examine them.
   Eric Delson, a professor of anthropology at the College of the
City of New York, also has examined the fossils and believes Susman
is correct that they represent the hands of a toolmaker.
   But Delson said it has not been proven positively that the
fossils are, in fact, those of Paranthropus robustus.
   ``The tools could be from the Homo species,'' said Delson.
   Delson also argues that Susman may be premature about his
conclusions on the effect of tool making on the two humanlike
species.
   ``All of this is inferential and I think he is making too much
of his inferences,'' said Delson.
   Susman's study was published today in Science, the journal of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
