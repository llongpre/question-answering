HERE are three things you may not know about travel in eastern Europe,
writes Michael Thompson-Noel:
1) Tick-borne encephalitis is known to exist in forested areas from the
Austria-Hungary border east to the outskirts of Budapest, so you might want
to get a vaccination. Risk season: March-November.
2) When leaving Warsaw, you will have only yourself to blame if your luggage
doesn't make it onto the aircraft. You have to put it on the correct
conveyor belt yourself.
3) You get what you pay for if you buy 2-cent (30-stotinki) Bulgarian
condoms (aka Medbio Protex). They tend to fall apart as soon as you unroll
them.
These facts, plus thousands more, can be found in On The Loose In Eastern
Europe, one of four new-style budget guidebooks - the Berkeley Guides -
produced by students of the University of California and published by
Fodor's. The other three guides in the series cover Mexico, California, and
the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. In Britain they cost Pounds 8.99
With luck, the Berkeley Guides will detonate a bomb in the fusty old world
of guidebook publishing. True, their political correctness may grate on some
readers: 'We tell you if a place is wheelchair-accessible,' they say, 'let
you know where people of colour may encounter discrimination, provide
resources (information) for gay and lesbian travellers, and recognise the
needs of women . . .' The guides are even printed on recycled paper using
soy-based inks and are tied-in with various ecological action groups.
But they are funky (Time's description), well organised, well written and
packed with insightful and up-to-date information. 'We wrote the books,' say
the editors, 'because the current crop of guidebooks doesn't appeal to
student travellers . . . the competition has been regurgitating the same old
muck for decades. In contrast, the Berkeley Guides are written from scratch.
The information is fresh . . . the destinations covered were slept in, eaten
in, boogied down in, and sized up by our writers. If a place sucks, we tell
you and recommend something else.'
Consider this paragraph from the section on Debrecen, capital city of the
Great Plain of Hungary, near the Romanian border: 'It's not unheard of to
miss the last train back to Debrecen (about 8.15pm) while waiting for the
waiters at the Hortobagyi Csarda to bring the bill. Hitchhiking after
sundown is something of a challenge round here, so you may have to check
into Camping Puszta for a night. This campground just behind the Herdsman
Museum rents bungalows for Dollars 7.70 and tents for Dollars 1.55 per
person. The friendly staff changes money at a decent rate and rents bikes
for Dollars 3.20 a day (the flat countryside is perfect for biking).'
Wrinklies will not get much of a kick from the Berkeley Guides. But they are
not only for students. They pack in so much information, and convey it so
breezily, that they deserve wide readerships. Other guidebook publishers
will just have to catch up.
DID YOU know that Neanderthal is a valley not far from Dusseldorf, in
Nordrhein-Westfalen? Nor me. The valley was a remote place until about 1830,
when quarrying revealed numerous caves, in one of which was discovered the
skeleton of Neanderthal Man.
Today, Neanderthal is a nature preserve with many broad hiking trails.
Families go to picnic there. There is a museum which tells the story of the
discovery and contains a replica of the skeleton (the original skull is in
the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn). There is an inn and a small hotel.
The museum is open daily except Mondays, but closed in December and January.
I discovered all this from The Scientific Traveller, an unusual guidebook
described as the first-ever guide to Europe's scientific heritage. It offers
plenty of information. But it also describes places and people related to
the history of scientific discovery throughout Europe. The authors, Charles
Tanford and Jacqueline Reynolds, are scientists themselves.
The Scientific Traveller, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Pounds 10.95.
