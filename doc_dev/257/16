   Scientists said today they have found the
earliest direct evidence for use of fire by ape-men or early humans,
bone fragments that were burned as long as 1.5 million years ago.
   Fires were apparently a regular event in the South African cave
where the fragments were found, although it is unclear whether they
were for cooking, warmth or scaring predators, scientists said.
   ``We're not absolutely certain those bones were there (in fire)
because they were food remains,'' said researcher Andrew Sillen.
``They could have been thrown into the fire as kind of a refuse
heap.''
   Sillen, of the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and C.K.
Brain of the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria, South Africa, describe
their analysis in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   The fires may have been set by ancestors of humans called Homo
erectus, or by ape-men called Australopithecus robustus, which are
not direct human ancestors, they wrote.
   In an interview, Sillen said the bone fragments could be 1
million to 1.5 million years old, but most likely they are 1.2
million years old.
   Previous research suggests fire was being used in Kenya a bit
more recently than 1.4 million years ago, a date many experts accept
but with some hesitancy, said Eric Delson, professor of anthropology
at Lehman College of the City University of New York.
   That research is supported by indirect evidence, magnetic
irregularities in the ground thought caused by ancient fire on the
surface, he said in a telephone interview.
   The evidence from the new study is ``certainly the strongest to
date in favor of early human-controlled fire,'' Delson said.
   Other research suggests fire was used slightly less than 500,000
years ago in Hungary, France and China, and certainly less than
150,000 years ago in Africa and Europe, he said.
   In the new work, researchers used bones recovered from South
Africa's Swartkrans cave, well-known for providing remains of Homo
erectus and the ape-man robustus.
   To make sure they could identify signs of ancient burning,
researchers took a fresh leg bone from a South African antelope
called a hartebeest, and heated bone slices to different
temperatures.
   Then they used the chemical and microscopic characteristics found
in the heated slices to analyze the fossils. They concluded that 270
fossil fragments had been burnt, with most identifiable ones from
antelope.
   Fragments from zebra, warthog, baboon and a finger bone of
robustus were also identified. The robustus bone does not
necessarily mean an ape-man was eaten, since the purpose of the
fires is unknown, Sillen said.
   The fragments' color and structure showed they had been heated to
a range of temperatures similar to that recorded in experimental
campfires set by Brain. The experimental fires used what was
probably the most common wood in the vicinity in ancient days,
Sillen said.
   In the interview, Sillen said no burnt bones were found in older
sections of the cave even though the conditions for deposition of
fossils were identical. That suggests the burnt fragments mark the
beginning of the use of fire, he said.
   Delson said the idea that the fragments burned in natural fires
rather than deliberate blazes cannot be ruled out. But Randall
Susman, a researcher at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook who has studied the ancient inhabitants of the Swartkrans
cave, said he believes the fires were deliberate.
   ``It's highly unlikely that these bones would have been burned in
a naturally occuring situation,'' he said. Range fires would not
have reached the campfire-like temperatures identified for the bone
fragments, he said.
   In addition, Homo erectus was known to use fire elsewhere, he
said.
   Homo erectus appeared about 1.6 million years ago and evolved
into a more advanced form by about 250,000 years ago. Robustus
appeared about 2.5 million years ago and survived until at least 1
million years ago before extinction.
