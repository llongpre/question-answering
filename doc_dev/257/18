   Scientists today said an apelike creature that
lived 10 million years ago may be the earliest known direct
ancestor of humans.
   The claim met sharp skepticism from experts who said they were
unconvinced by the researchers' anatomical analysis of a remnant of
the creature's skull.
   ``I don't believe for a minute'' that the beast is a direct
human ancestor, Peter Andrews of the Natural History Museum in
London said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   The analysis also implies that ancestors of humans may have
started evolving away from ancestors of chimps and gorillas
millions of years earlier than many scientists believe.
   It is presented in the British journal Nature by L. de Bonis of
the University of Poitiers in France, G. Bouvrain and D. Geraads of
the University of Paris, and G. Koufos of the University of
Thessaloniki in Greece.
   The fossil, found last September in Greece, is thought to be 9
million to 10 million years old. It represents a previously known
animal called Ouranopithecus macedoniensis.
   The fossil includes the right part and a portion of the left
part of an adult's face, plus the upper jaw with most of the teeth,
the researchers said.
   They said the fossil's anatomy suggests that Ouranopithecus
macedoniensis appeared on the human branch of the evolutionary tree
after that lineage split from the ancestors of gibbons, orangutans,
gorillas and chimpanzees.
   That would make it a direct ancestor of humans.
   The researchers also suggested that the human lineage may have
started evolving away from the ancestors of chimps and gorillas as
long as 12 million years ago.
   Other scientists have put that split at 5 million to 7 million
years ago, said Lawrence Martin, assistant professor in
antholopology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
   Martin, who has studied other fossils from Ouranopithecus
macedoniensis, said he is ``absolutely sure'' the new study is
wrong in assigning the beast to the human lineage.
   Martin said he puts the beast further back in evolution, before
the human lineage started evolving away from ancestors of
chimpanzees and gorillas.
