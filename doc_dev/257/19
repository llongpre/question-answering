   Ancient ancestors of humans apparently ate soft
fruits and leaves, but their evolutionary cousins chomped on nuts
and bark, a new study of fossil teeth suggests.
   The work bears on a longstanding debate over whether the two
kinds of animals ate different diets or just differing amounts of
the same food, said researcher Frederick Grine.
   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by Grine, associate professor of anthropology at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, and Richard Kay, professor
of anatomy at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
   They studied detailed replicas of molars that human ancestors
called Australopithecus left 2.5 million to 2.8 million years ago
in South Africa, and that other beasts called Paranthropus left
there 1.5 million to 1.8 million years ago.
   The two kinds of animals are also known as gracile and robust
australopithecines, respectively.
   Both walked upright, but after their lineages split 2.5 million
years ago, the Australopithecus group evolved toward modern humans
while the Paranthropus branch eventually died out.
   Grine and Kay studied microscopic patterns of dental wear and
compared them to teeth from modern animals with known diets.
   Paranthropus teeth showed more pits, and wider pits and
scratches, suggesting a diet of tougher foods than Australopithecus
ate, researchers said. The difference probably led to the bigger
teeth and larger jaws of Paranthropus, they said.
