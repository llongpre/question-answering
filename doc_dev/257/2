   Anatomically modern humans lived in Israel
92,000 years ago, scientists said today in a study that pushes back
the earliest known reliable date for the ancient humans by some
50,000 years.
   The finding supports the hypothesis that anatomically modern
humans evolved in Africa rather than independently in several
places, and weighs against the idea that they descended from
Neanderthals, scientists said.
   The study, reported by scientists from France and Israel, is
``very important for the study of the human evolution,'' said David
Pilbeam, anthrolopology professor at Harvard University.
   The work appears in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Researchers reported that 20 burnt flints found along with
ancient human remains in the Qafzeh cave in lower Galilee were
about 92,000 years old, give or take 5,000 years. So the ancient
humans lived there that long ago, researchers said.
   That means some anatomically modern humans occupied southwest
Asia before Neanderthals arrived, a sharp challenge to the view
that they evolved from Neanderthals, wrote Chris Stringer of the
British Museum (Natural History) in an editorial accompanying the
report.
   Neanderthals lived in Europe and Asia from about 150,000 or
200,000 years ago until about 35,000 years ago.
   Harvard's Pilbeam said the Israeli finding more than doubles
``what was previously accepted as a really good age for modern
humans,'' which was 35,000 to 40,000 years.
   Eric Delson, anthropology professor at Lehman College in New
York, said some fossils from Africa suggests ages of 90,000 years
and even older for modern humans, but that the evidence for those
dates is not firm.
   In a telephone interview, Delson said the new finding supports
the view that modern man arose in Africa because it provides an
early date for their living near that continent. The theory holds
that more than 100,000 years ago, modern humans split into a group
that stayed in Africa and another that went to Europe and Asia.
   The humans in the Israeli cave may well have been members of
early Eurasian stock, different from any living race but near the
common ancestor of non-Africans, Delson said.
   Stringer, in his editorial, said the early date for the Israeli
population poses some questions, such as why modern humans took
another 50,000 years to register their presence in Europe and the
Far East.
   Perhaps the environment to the north was too unsuitable, or the
Neanderthals too well established, to allow a migration until all
that time had elapsed, he said. Or perhaps they did migrate
earlier, and their fossil remains have yet to be discovered,
Stringer wrote.
