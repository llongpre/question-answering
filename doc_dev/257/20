<HEAD>Study: Human Ancestors Ate Softer Foods Than Evolutionary Cousins

   A study of ancient teeth suggests ancestors of
humans ate soft fruits and leaves but their evolutionary cousins
ate nuts and bark, scientists reported today.
   The study compared microscopic wear patterns of teeth from human
ancestors called Australopithecus and their ``cousins,'' called
Paranthropus, with those of modern animals with known diets.
   The work is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by Frederick Grine, associate professor of anthropology at
the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Richard Kay,
professor of anatomy at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
   They studied detailed replicas of molars that Australopithecus
left some 2.5 million to 2.8 million years ago in South Africa, and
that Paranthropus left there some 1.5 million to 1.8 million years
ago.
   The two kinds of animals are also known as gracile and robust
australopithecines, respectively.
   Both walked upright, but after their lineages split some 2.5
million years ago, the Australopithecus group evolved toward modern
humans while the Paranthropus branch eventually died out.
   In the study, Paranthropus teeth showed more pits, and wider
pits and scratches, suggesting a diet of tougher foods than
Australopithecus ate, researchers said. The difference probably led
to the bigger teeth and larger jaws of Paranthropus, they said.
