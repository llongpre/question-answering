<HEAD>Ancient Fossil Missing Link in Ancestors of Mammals</HEAD>

   A long-misclassified fossil of a 280
million-year-old animal with three pairs of horns on its head is a
missing link in the family tree of the ancient reptiles that were
ancestors of the mammals, according to a report today.
   Researchers believe the creature, known as tetraceratops,
represents an evolutionary step between the older, reptile-like
animals called the pelycosaurs and the later therapsids that were
forerunners of the mammals.
   The fossil skull was discovered around the turn of the century
in Texas, but its evolutionary significance was not recognized
because it was surrounded in rock that was hard to remove.
   The discovery of its place in evolution was made by Michel
Laurin and Robert R. Reisz of the University of Toronto. They
reported their work in the British journal Nature.
   ``As the most primitive known therapsid,'' they wrote,
``tetraceratops bridges the large morphological gap between
primitive and advanced mammal-like reptiles.''
   They based their analysis largely on the shape of the bones and
teeth of the fossilized head. It combined primitive features of the
pelycosaurs as well as hints of the more modern therapsids that
came after them.
   Since only the creature's head was recovered, the scientists did
not speculate about the size or shape of its body.
   The animals lived before the rise of the dinosaurs, which ruled
the planet during the Mesozoic era, which began 225 million years
ago. The first mammals were tiny, shrew-like animals that lived
during the Jurassic period between 180 million and 130 million
years ago.
