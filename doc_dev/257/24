TAR-PIT BONES REVEAL AILMENTS OF EXTINCT SABER-TOOTH CATS

Scientists at the La Brea tar pits are studying the illnesses and injuries that 
plagued a creature extinct for at least 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Staff and volunteer paleopathologists at the George C. Page Museum are 
cataloguing the ills that the saber-toothed cat fell prey to. Knowing what went 
wrong with the long-vanished cats, incorrectly called tigers by earlier 
researchers, has no obvious utility. But it provides intriguing clues to how 
they lived in sickness and in health. 
</P>
<P>
The Page Museum in Hancock Park houses the fossils of countless animals and 
plants that were trapped in the area's tar pits, vast deposits of asphalt that 
continues to seep to the surface and scent the park. Between 10,000 and 40,000 
years ago, giant mammoths, dire wolves and hundreds of other Ice Age species 
were trapped in the asphalt deposits like flies on flypaper. Their remains, 
preserved by the substance that killed them, constitute one of the greatest 
caches of Ice Age fossils in the world.

5,000 Injured Bones 
</P>
<P>
Fred P. Heald, 75, a retired surgeon who lives in Palos Verdes Estates, assumed 
the daunting task of putting the museum's 75-year-old collection of diseased 
and traumatized bones in order. 
</P>
<P>
"Paleopathology," the volunteer explained, "is the study of diseases and 
injuries present in fossil specimens." Among the 500,000 specimens in the 
museum's vast ossuary are some 5,000 saber-toothed cat bones that show evidence 
of everything from arthritis to infection with the fungus that causes Valley 
fever to a half-broken neck. (The pathology collection includes 4,000 dire wolf 
bones as well.) 
</P>
<P>
"I started out at one end of the collection and worked clear through, bone by 
bone," recalled Heald, who jotted his description and diagnosis of each 
specimen on an index card. 
</P>
<P>
Heald learned about Smilodon californicus, as the saber-tooth is properly 
called, as he went along. "Nobody has ever written a textbook on the anatomy 
and pathology of a Smilodon cat," he said, "but, fortunately, all animals are 
hooked up pretty much the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Heald was delighted to discover that, anatomically at least, the saber-tooth 
responded to illness and injury much as humans do. Working with museum staffer 
Christopher A. Shaw, who is interested in the relationship of physical form to 
function, Heald can make intelligent guesses about how the cats brought down 
their prey and even about their social organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Animal 
</P>
<P>
"I sat for four or five hours a day, just writing down what I saw," Heald 
recalled. "Out of the trees came a little better view of the forest." 
</P>
<P>
The scientists are convinced by the asphalt-blackened bones that the 
saber-toothed cat was a social animal that hunted with others in a pack or 
pride. As Heald explained, the bones show evidence of wounds, fractures and 
dislocations disabling enough to have caused death if the animal had been a 
solitary hunter. 
</P>
<P>
But from clues such as broken sabers worn smooth over time, the scientists know 
that even some cats that had lost their characteristic canine teeth lived with 
their disabilities for a considerable period before their sticky demise in the 
tar pits. No longer able to kill for themselves, the cats probably lived on the 
scraps of kills made by others in the group, the men speculate. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw noted that a modern observer can't help but wince at some of the maladies 
reflected in the collection, such as a hip that shows evidence of a massive 
infection, which must have caused the animal considerable pain. "I sit there 
and think, 'How did this guy get around?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pathological or not, the museum's bones are remarkably eloquent. Page Museum 
staffer Antonia Tejada-Flores found evidence that the saber-tooth roared when 
she came across a cigar box full of fossilized throat bones called hyoids. The 
hyoids of the saber-tooth had relatively elastic connections, similar to those 
of contemporary cats that roar. Non-roaring cats have relatively inflexible 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Former museum staffer William A. Akersten found other bones to bolster his 
theory that the cats used their sabers, not primarily to stab or slash, but to 
execute a calamitous shearing bite to soft parts of their prey, which then bled 
to death or died of shock. 
</P>
<P>
As Shaw pointed out, the saber-toothed cat is an especially intriguing animal 
"because there's nothing like them around today. It's fascinating to see what 
made them go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stealth Hunter 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of their bones, the scientists believe the cat was a stealth 
hunter. "It's not a fast animal like a cheetah," said the 37-year-old Shaw, a 
Granada Hills resident who is the museum's curator of collections. "The tail is 
the biggest clue. Animals that run down their prey generally have a large tail 
for balance. The Smilodon had a very short tail." 
</P>
<P>
In a scientific paper, Heald praised bone as an expressive medium. "Living 
bone," he wrote, "is not a hard, unyielding material that holds animals 
together. Bone is dynamic, it responds to use and especially to misuse. It has 
quite set ways of growing and of healing itself after injury which are common 
to all animals." 
</P>
<P>
Heald explained that when an animal's muscles are stressed, little tears occur. 
There is bleeding, and then telltale calluses form on the bone. Many of the 
cats in the collection sustained terrible, repeated stress injuries to their 
necks and backs that cause the scientists to speculate that the saber-tooth 
cats leaped on large prey with great force. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery in a Texas cave of another kind of saber-tooth surrounded by the 
bones of young mastodons and mammoths leads the men to believe juvenile 
elephants were probably a Smilodon foodstuff. Without the cats, Heald 
theorized, "the world would have been clear up to its eyes in elephants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lions Kill Large Prey 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, Heald and others using the paleopathology collection are aware that, 
however logical their theories about what the saber-tooth did, no one will ever 
know for sure if they are right. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Shaw noted, the museum staff thought the saber-tooth's largest 
front toe was probably toward the middle of its paw, like a modern lion's. But 
the recent find of an almost complete saber-tooth skeleton in the tar pits, 
with its bones in place, reveals that the big toes were across from each other 
on the inside of the paws -- in the same position as human toes.
