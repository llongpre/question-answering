<LEADPARA>  SCIENTISTS last week announced they had unearthed a 50 million-year-old skull
of a bug-eyed, jug-eared primate, a creature no bigger than a mouse, but a
find that upsets the traditional family tree that includes monkeys, apes and
humans.;    A team from the Carnegie Museum and the Denver Museum of Natural
History uncovered four skulls of a primitive version of a tiny primate called
a tarsier that lived in Wyoming when the cowboy state was covered with a lush,
palm-studded forest.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The creature, named Shoshonius, had goggle eyes, a very short muzzle and
enlarged, bony ear chambers. It ate bugs and fruit. Modern tarsiers are
nocturnal tree dwellers in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.;    What
makes the fossilized remains of the tarsier interesting is their age. Until
now, the evolutionary tree had tarsiers and anthropoids, which include the
ancestors of monkeys and man, splitting apart 35 million years ago.;   
Apparently, that is incorrect. The tarsiers went their own way at least 50
million years ago, while the earliest known anthropoid is from Africa and only
35 million years old.;    "This means that the fossil record of at least the
first 15 million years of anthropoid evolution is missing and awaits
discovery," the scientists said.;    The Shoshonius was named for Shoshoni,
Wyo., the town in the Wind River Basin where the researchers found the skulls
in rock quarries from 1984 to 1987. Leg, arm and jaw bones also were found.;  
 "When we turned over that rock and saw those two eye sockets staring us in
the face, we knew we had found something significant," said paleontologist
Richard Stucky of the Denver museum.;    The report appeared in the Jan. 3
issue of Nature.  </TEXT>
