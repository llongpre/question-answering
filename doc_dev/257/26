  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A human evolution history 
research team of Kim Il-song University recently unearthed in 
and around Pyongyang 42 pieces of 20 fossil men, 298 pieces of 
stone implements, 109 pieces of bone implements, two bone 
sculptures and 34,702 pieces of fossil animals belonging to the 
Paleolithic age and 15 pieces of six fossil men, 23 pieces of 
stone implements, six pieces of bone implements, 43 pieces of 
earthenware, one piece of ornament and 1,047 pieces of fossil 
animals belonging to the Neolithic age and 12 pieces of five 
fossil men, one piece of earthenware and two pieces of stone 
implements belonging to the Bronze age. 
  In this connection, a symposium for reading papers on the 
scientific research into fossil men and relics recently 
unearthed in and around Pyongyang took place at Kim Il-song 
University Thursday. 
  Published at the symposium were data about a profound 
scientific and theoretical analysis of the archaeological 
significance of the fossil men and relics discovered in Chungri 
cave, Yonggok cave No. 1 and Taehung caves Nos. 1 and 3 and the 
features of the bones of ancient Koreans and the results of the 
research into the systematic evolution of Koreans in Pyongyang. 
  According to them, scores of pieces of relics unearthed from 
the first and second cultural layers of the Paleolithic age in 
Chungri cave show that the cultural traditions of primitive men 
who left the Komunmoru relics were carried forward by their 
descendants in Pyongyang. 
  The geologic time of Yonggok cave No. 1 where ten fossil men 
were unearthed on the second, third and fourth cultural layers 
of the Paleolithic age ranges from the beginning of the 
Pleistocene epoch to the Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period 
and that of Taehung cave No. 1 where three fossil men were 
unearthed on the cultural layer of the Paleolithic age ranges 
from the end of the Pleistocene epoch to the beginning of the 
Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period. 
  In Taehung cave No. 3 fossil men, 43 pieces of earthenware 
and 65 fossil bones of animals were discovered. The earthenware 
used by ancient Koreans in Pyongyang represents their wisdom and 
creative talent and noble esthetics. It is patent proof that 
the common features of the culture of the homogeneous Korean 
nation were carried forward in the Neolithic age, too. 
  The fossil human bones and relics which have been unearthed 
and studied prove that the evolution of Koreans took place in 
Pyongyang in regular order. 
  This is because the features of Koreans were formed in due 
sequence with Pyongyang as the centre, the culture of ancient 
Koreans was developed systematically with Pyongyang as the 
centre and Pyongyang was the best place for the life of mankind. 
  The participants in the symposium said the symposium proved 
that the evolution of Koreans took place in this land, notably 
in Pyongyang in regular order and that Pyongyang had sufficient 
natural conditions and paleontological conditions for the origin 
and development of ancient Koreans.
