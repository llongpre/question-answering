   The remains of more than 130 ancient Indians
have been reburied after three years of research provided scientists
with new knowledge about pre-historic humans in Nevada.
   The remains showed a record of continuous human occupation of the
Stillwater Marshes for at least 5,000 years, said anthropologists
and archaeologists at the Nevada State Museum in Carson City.
   They said the bones and artifacts also showed that the ancient
Stillwater people were more numerous, less nomadic and healthier
than many scientists originally thought.
   The graves of the people believed to be the ancestors of the
modern-day Paiute Indians were exposed by floods during the
record-wet winters of 1982-84 in the Stillwater Marshes near here.
   The bones were quietly reburied in a private Paiute ceremony
earlier this month at an undisclosed site in the marshes 60 miles
east of Reno.
   Anthropologists were able to identify more than 130 individuals,
the most ever found at a prehistoric site in Nevada, officials said.
   Anan Raymond, archaeologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service at Stillwater, said that gives the site national
significance and makes it one of the most important archaeological
finds in Nevada.
   Sheilagh Brooks, a University of Nevada-Las Vegas anthropologist,
said the 4,000 bones temporarily removed from the marshes could have
represented as many as 416 people. But she said no more than 133
individuals were confirmed since there were too few bones and they
were mixed up.
   Using carbon dating at the University of California-Riverside,
scientists found some bones as old as 3,200 years and some buried as
recently as three centuries ago, Raymond said.
   However, Raymond said the type of artifacts found at the sites,
mainly arrowheads, pushes those dates back ``a couple thousand more
years.''
   Anthropologists were unable to establish a direct genetic link
between the remains and the modern Paiutes, but found ``a lot of
similarity in the skulls and faces,'' Brooks said.
   She said remains of prehistoric Indians found at various
locations in northern Nevada, including Stillwater, are quite
similar to today's Indians, ``big-boned, what we call well-built,
sturdy people, with big noses. They show very little change in
time.''
   Richard Hicks, chairman of the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, said he has
no doubts the remains belong to his ancestors.
   The tribe still was burying some of its dead in the marshes as
late as the 1930s, he said. ``Some of us in our 50s can remember
that when we were little guys, they would take them back out that
way, toward the desert.''
   The marsh also yielded house foundations, hearths, roasting pits,
food storage pits, garbage heaps and extensive stone tools.
   ``This is not a burial site, per se, but a bigger picture: a
place where people lived, hunted and fished and buried their
kinsmen,'' Raymond said.
