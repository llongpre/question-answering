The study of ancient genes, brought to life so spectacularly in the Jurassic
Park film, is beginning to transform archaeology.
While re-creating a dinosaur will remain a fantasy for the foreseeable
future, researchers are already extracting and identifying DNA from
materials thousands of years old.
The results will contribute a wealth of information about human history over
the past 10,000 years in three main areas: people's evolution and migration
patterns; their agriculture and diet; and health and sickness in ancient
societies.
Research findings illustrate the potential of genetic archaeology in each
area.
Human DNA has been extracted from prehistoric bones found in Polynesia, by
Erika Hagelberg of Cambridge University.
Comparing the occurrence of one particular genetic mutation among the
ancient and modern inhabitants of the region, she concludes that the islands
of the central Pacific such as Samoa and Tonga were probably first settled
about 2,500 years ago by people moving west from the Melanesian
archipelagos; this contradicts the traditional view that Polynesia was
colonised directly from south-east Asia.
Many of the puzzles surrounding prehistoric migrations and settlement
patterns - such as the movement of people north-westward through Europe and
southward through America - will be solved by a systematic analysis of
ancient DNA from archaeological sites, combined with tests on contemporary
populations.
Wheat DNA has been isolated from charred grains found at Danebury, an Iron
Age British hill fort, by Martin Jones, another Cambridge archaeologist. His
group identified part of a gene linked to glutonin, a key protein which
helps to determine the bread-making qualities of the grain, and compared it
to modern wheat varieties.
Such research will provide fascinating information about ancient foods. But
tracking the genetic patterns of crop plants and domesticated animals will
also be useful for another purpose: to complement the evidence emerging from
the human genetic studies about population movements.
Tuberculosis DNA from human remains found in Borneo and Peru, dating from
before the first European contacts, has been isolated by Mark Spigelman of
the Institute of Archaeology, London, and Arthur Aufderheide of the
University of Minnesota. Their discoveries show that the TB bacillus
occurred throughout the ancient world. This means that early European
colonists should no longer be blamed for bringing TB to the New World.
Several research groups are now working to find out whether other diseases
such as syphilis, measles and influenza were present in pre-Columbian
America.
The study of ancient diseases is proving particularly popular, because the
findings will be relevant to modern medicine. Epidemiologists could learn a
lot from the ebb and flow of bacterial and viral infections over the
centuries - and their relation to changes in the virulence of the germs on
the one hand and in human living conditions on the other. Although TB, for
example, was present in pre-Columbian America, it may not have caused
serious disease until the colonists destroyed the structure of indigenous
society.
Previously, archaeologists had only been able to study slow-acting diseases
that leave their mark on human bones, such as leprosy and syphilis.
Paleogenetics should enable them to look at the population dynamics of other
important infections such as smallpox, plague and malaria.
Although bones have so far been the main source of bacterial DNA, Mark
Spigelman is developing an alternative - ancient faeces and guts - in
collaboration with Colin and Liz Fricker, two microbiologists employed by
Thames Water (who are interested in using the same technology to detect
traces of bacterial contamination in water). The team has just succeeded in
isolating DNA from E Coli bacteria in the gut contents of Lindow Man, an
Iron Age bog body dated to 500 BC. The discovery opens up the possibility of
investigating germs in ancient cesspits, which would give information about
community health as well diseases in individuals.
The study of ancient genes is still scientifically controversial - though
most of the debate centres on reports of DNA fragments extracted from
insects trapped in amber many millions of years old. Some experts refuse to
accept that the DNA molecule is chemically robust enough to exist for so
long, even if it is sealed in an antiseptic preservative such as amber. They
suspect that the 'dinosaur age' insect and bacterial DNA extracted by the
Californian researchers, George Poinar and Raul Cano, is actually modern
genetic material introduced by accidental contamination.
Even the sceptics concede that DNA may survive under exceptional conditions
for up to 10,000 years, which covers most of the period of interest to
archaeologists. But they point out that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -
the gene-amplifying technology used to fish a few DNA fragments out of a
sample and make billions of copies for analysis - is extremely susceptible
to contamination.
The first results of genetic archaeology will have to be confirmed by
independent experiments - by scientists working separately on the same or
very similar material - before they are generally accepted as valid. But
this is unlikely to take long, as scientists are moving rapidly into the
field. The prospects are that we will learn more in the next decade about
the way our prehistoric ancestors lived than we have over the past century.
