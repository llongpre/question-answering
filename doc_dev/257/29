   Doug Ubelaker used to examine
skeletons for clues to the way people lived thousands of years ago.
Now he's trying to figure out from bodies found along highways how
eight women died just months ago.
   Using calipers to measure bones and clay to reconstruct faces,
the Smithsonian Institution anthropologist brought here by a
frustrated prosecutor has helped identify the victims, women
between ages 25 and 36 with histories of drug use or prostitution.
A ninth body was sent to Ubelaker last week.
   His work has not led to the arrest of a suspected serial killer.
But he may have cleared an innocent man: Sources close to the
investigation say his conclusion that two of the women were
murdered between mid-summer and late fall led prosecutors to rule
out a suspect who had been in jail on other charges.
   An expert in the emerging field of forensic anthropology,
Ubelaker, 42, is one of about 40 U.S. anthropologists who work
regularly with police, applying knowledge of ancient skeletons to
the grisly business of solving murders.
   ``Anthropologists like myself spend their careers looking at the
bones of people who lived long ago, trying to figure out what
diseases they had, how tall they were, who they were related to,
what problems they had, how well they were adapted to their
environment,'' he said. ``It turns out, though, that the techniques
that we use to study these past populations are the same as those
needed to analyze modern remains in criminal cases.''
   Few anthropologists are willing to make the switch from cold
science to cold blood, which takes ``tremendous intestinal
fortitude'' as well as keen observational skills, said Walter H.
Birkby, a professor of forensic anthropology at the University of
Arizona in Tucson.
   Birkby, a pioneer in the field, got hooked when police found a
decomposed body and took it to a University of Kansas laboratory in
1962. At first, he was repulsed by the body, which was ``so ripe
the officers couldn't put it in their car; they wrapped it in a
plastic bag and tied it to the bumper.''
   He and other graduate students boiled the remains to the bone,
carefully measured the skeleton, and concluded it was a young
woman, who had apparently been murdered. Birkby doesn't remember if
the killer was caught; he does recall thinking, ``This is real
detective work.''
   In cases in which a body is found mostly intact, police usually
call in a forensic pathologist, a physician trained in
crime-solving techniques. But if the body has decomposed and little
is left but a skeleton, they increasingly turn to someone with a
doctorate in physical anthropology.
   ``Other people may be better with flesh, but when it comes to
bones, we're the experts,'' said Professor Alison Galloway, a
forensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
   Forensic anthropologists can measure the width of pelvic bones
to determine sex, use microscopic pieces of a thigh bone to
calculate age, and make a clay model of a face based on the shape
of the skull.
   Dental records still are one of the surest ways to identify a
body, but they often are not available. So Birkby and others
developed skull-photo superimposition, in which they project a
photograph of a missing person onto a skull to see whether it fits.
   Although many Americans have mixed blood, Galloway said, it
often is possible to determine race _ black, white or Asian _ from
the shape of the skull, teeth and leg bones. Blacks, for example,
tend to have projecting jaw bones and ridges above the eyes. Whites
have receding cheek bones and narrow noses, and Asians have
shovel-shaped incisors and more curved leg bones.
   A careful examination of a skeleton often reveals not only the
type of murder weapon but also its precise characteristics. In a
previous Massachusetts case, Ubelaker told police he was nearly
certain, from some oddly chipped rib bones, that a young woman had
been killed by a long-bladed knife with a bent tip. A knife
matching that description was later found near the murder scene.
   Calculating when a person died is often trickier, involving
rough estimates of the rate of decay based on the body's location
and exposure to moisture, sun and animals, Galloway said.
   In about 15 percent of the cases referred to him by the FBI,
Ubelaker said, the remains aren't even human _ they are bones from
dogs or deer, oddly melted pieces of plastic, or something else.
