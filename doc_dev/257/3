   Archaelogical finds by a team of American,
French and Israeli professors indicate primitive man may have been
able to do more than grunt, as commonly believed.
   The team has discovered a two-inch bone called a hyoid from a
60,000-year-old skeleton which they believe is a key to the
beginnings of speech in ancient humans.
   ``For the first time it is possible to say from an anatomical
point of view that primitive man could speak,'' said Professor
Baruch Arensberg of Tel Aviv Univerisity, a member of the team
studying the remains found in northern Israel.
   The findings of Arensberg and his team, however, have set off a
debate among scientists and linguists over the origins of speech.
Some dispute the team's conclusions.
   The skeleton of a 30-year-old Neanderthal man discovered at the
Kebara cave near Haifa in northern Israel in 1983 has yielded the
first hyoid bone ever found in primitive man, said Arensberg.
   The U-shaped bone is an integral part of the vocal tract that
lies at the base of the skull in the neck and is linked to the
muscles of the tongue.
   Arensburg, a professor of anatomy who worked on the
archaelogical dig and analyzed the human remains, said the hyoid
bone proves primitive man had the same ability as modern man for
speech, though it does not prove he actually had language.
   Arensberg and a group of nine other professors directed by Ofer
Bar-Yosef of Harvard University and Bernard Vandermeersch of the
University of Bordeaux in France have studied the findings at
Kebara for the past six years.
   Using the hyoid and a jaw fragment from the same skeleton, they
estimated the location of Neanderthal man's vocal tract.
   They first published their conclusions concerning speech and the
hyoid in April in the British scientific journal Nature.
   On July 8, a scientific debate over the hyoid's significance
appeared in the American journal Science News.
   Linguist Phillip Lieberman of Brown Univeristy in Providence,
R.I., was quoted as saying: ``At this point, the Kebara hyoid
doesn't tell us anything about the evolution of speech and
language.''
   Lieberman argued that there is no basis for comparison because
no other hyoids have been found from the ancestors of modern man.
   Arensburg maintained, however, that the hyoid and jaw fragment
demonstrate that the location of the vocal tract in primitive man
and modern man is identical, giving primitive man the ability to
speak.
   Before the discovery, he said, scientists believed the vocal
tract was located higher in the neck as in other primates, which
would have made speech as now known impossible.
   ``My colleagues many years ago claimed that on the day the hyoid
is found, we will understand speech much better,'' Arensberg said.
   But those colleagues were surprised by the Kebara findings
because they contradicted their theory that primitive man could not
speak, he added.
   Anatomist Jeffrey Laitman of New York's Mount Sinai School of
Medicine also disputed the Kebara team's findings. He told Science
News: ``You can't reproduce the position of the entire vocal tract
with just a hyoid bone and a jaw fragment.''
   Anthropoligist Dean Falk of State University of New York at
Albany supports the Kebara findings in the Science News article.
   Through her own reconstruction of Neanderthal man's vocal tract
based on other skeletons, she concluded in 1975 that ancient man
could produce the full range of speech sounds.
   The Kebara man is extraordinary in its completeness, Arensberg
said. The team discovered almost an entire skeleton missing only
the skull and parts of the legs. He was about five-feet-four and
stood erect.
   The Kebara findings also indicate that Neanderthal man lived in
collectives or families, used tools extensively and buried the dead
similarly to modern man, Arensberg said.
