   Raymond Dart, a pioneering
anthropologist whose once-controversial discovery of a link between
man and ape is now widely accepted, died after a three-week illness.
He was 95.
   Dart died of a brain hemorrhage Tuesday at a clinic near
Johannesburg, said a colleague from the University of the
Witwatersrand, Professor Phillip Tobias.
   Dart became widely known in 1925, when he publicized his claim
that a skull found in South Africa's Cape Province came from an
ape-like, pre-human form of man that he called Australopithecus.
   For decades, his theory was viewed skeptically by most of his
professional peers. Some critics said the skull was that of a
chimpanzee, and Dart was denounced by religious groups who objected
to the theory of evolution.
   But later work by Dart and discoveries by other
paleoanthropologists in Africa eventually confirmed his theories.
   ``Dart is the grand old man of fossil-man research,'' Donald
Ortner, curator of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, said a few years ago. ``His early
observations on the evolutionary significance of
Australopithecus-Africanus were highly controversial at the time he
made them, but since then have been generally accepted.''
   Dart was born Feb. 4, 1893, in Brisbane, Australia, and graduated
from the Sydney University Medical School in 1917. In 1923, he was
hired as professor of anatomy at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg, where he taught until 1958. For 18 years, he was
dean of the university's medical school.
   The skull that brought him notoriety was recovered from a
limestone cave at Taung, on the edge of the Kalahari desert. After
weeks of examination, Dart concluded that it belonged to a child of
an ape-related species that had moved further in a human direction
than previously known species.
   Tobias, an internationally recognized anatomist, wrote in 1983:
``Dart's appreciation and interpretation of the hominoid-like traits
of Astralopithecus represent the single most important breakthrough
in paleoanthropology of the 20th century, next to which all the
other African discoveries represented a mere filling-in.''
