<LEADPARA>  Scientists on Thursday offered new genetic evidence to bolster the claim that
all living humans share a single African ancestor -- a woman who lived about
200,000 years ago and whose descendants swept across the earth, replacing a
more primitive human species as they went.;   The new data, published today in
the journal Science, compares a special form of genetic material taken from
contemporary humans from around the world and suggests the family tree of
modern Homo sapiens has its roots firmly planted in sub-Saharan Africa.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It has long been accepted that human evolution began in Africa about 2.5
million years ago with the appearance of Homo habilis. About a million years
later this species gave rise to Homo erectus, the first human ancestor to
migrate out of Africa and to populate southern Eurasia. The new findings
strongly suggest that the latest major step in that process -- the rise of
anatomically modern human beings, or Homo sapiens -- also occurred in Africa.;
  According to the theory developed by the late Allan Wilson of the University
of California, Berkeley, who completed the study before he died last summer,
the first modern humans arose in Africa between 166,000 and 249,000 years ago.
This ancient population -- numbering perhaps 10,000 at the start -- eventually
swept north out of Africa to Europe and Asia and then to Australia and the
Americas, replacing Homo erectus.;   The rival theory suggests that modern
humans arose more or less simultaneously in many parts of the world from the
Homo erectus populations already there.;   "This takes (the out-of-Africa
theory) much further, and I believe is much more powerful," said Christopher
Stringer of the Human Origins Group at the Natural History Museum in London.; 
 Since the theory was first presented by Wilson and his colleagues -- when the
ancestral woman was misleadingly dubbed "Eve" -- it has been criticized for
the methods used to compare the genetic material and for the fact that earlier
samples used African-Americans to represent native Africans.;   The new
evidence, gathered by Wilson and presented by his colleagues, including Linda
Vigilant and Mark Stoneking at Pennsylvania State University, is based on a
broader sample, including actual Africans of many different ethnic groups, and
a different method of calculating how long ago "Eve" lived.  </TEXT>
