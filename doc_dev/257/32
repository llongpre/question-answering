If this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably 
would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to 
a time before Sanskrit, English, Punjabi or Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm, 
past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings 
that produced all of the world's languages, something they like to call the 
Mother Tongue of Man. 
</P>
<P>
Such a discovery, this group of mostly Soviet and East European researchers 
believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution 
of the spoken word from a single tongue. 
</P>
<P>
But while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually 
prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in 
reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Historical linguist Vitaly Shevoroshkin of the University of Michigan in Ann 
Arbor sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he 
and his colleagues in the Soviet Union have done. 
</P>
<P>
For one, the evolution of language not only shows "how some words have become 
petrified," by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the West. 
</P>
<P>
To hear Shevoroshkin tell it, only a handful of Americans are interested in 
learning the words spoken by early Homo sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans 
whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the 
direct ancestors of modern people. 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original 
words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of 
those ever spoken on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the 
Mother Tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"A proto language means a language family like Indo-European. If you say 
proto-proto that's an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea 
especially people in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you say proto-proto-proto, that's something completely different. 
Perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we 
can go back only 30,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years 
ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. That is a very big gap and we don't know 
how to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his quest, however, Shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie 
the world's languages together and link them to the past. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, he is building on the work of Soviet linguists Sergei Starostin, 
Vladislav Marakovic Illic-Svityc and Aaron Dolgopolsky who more than 20 years 
ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call 
Nostratic, which means "our language." 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of Nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis 
of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the 
ancient tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, 
Kartvelian, Euralic, Dravidian, Altaic and Eskimo-Aleutian language families. 
Hence, making Nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as Shevoroshkin would 
put it -- a proto-proto language. 
</P>
<P>
His hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the 
clues that will link him to the remote past. 
</P>
<P>
Language is unique to the human species, Shevoroshkin said, and one of the 
primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that 
set humans apart from their cousin primates, the Great Apes. 
</P>
<P>
He believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into 
the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in 
every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for 
parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Such studies produced one of the startling findings in Nostratic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By studying the word for "eye" in many languages, Soviet researchers were able 
to surmise what the word was in Nostratic. 
</P>
<P>
"In English, the word is eye. But in German it is auge, very similar. In old 
Russian it is oko and in Nostratic we believe it was huka." 
</P>
<P>
Words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said, 
emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there 
are no words for domesticated animals other than dog. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even Shevoroshkin admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many 
historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find 
a language before Nostratic. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University linguistic anthropologist Joseph Greenberg, who has 
developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages, 
is one who questions how well Shevoroshkin will do. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the 
world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify 
Earth's myriad tongues past and present. 
</P>
<P>
His work produced the classification of African languages in the 1950s, the 
groupings generally accepted by linguists today. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg would not call the efforts of Shevoroshkin and his co-investigators 
futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough to show that all human languages have a common origin," said 
Greenberg. "I think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family 
tree (of languages)." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem with family trees, Shevoroshkin said, is that it is easy to 
leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"Linguists divide languages into several families such as Uralic, Indo-European 
or Afro-Asiatic, and so on. They usually say they are not related and if they 
are there is no proof. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that," Shevoroshkin 
said of his endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little 
sense to me," offered Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
But linguist Merritt Ruhlen, formerly of Stanford, acknowledged recently in the 
journal Science that Shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient 
link tying the world's languages to a common tongue.
