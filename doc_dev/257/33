<LEADPARA>  Researchers Friday announced dramatic new finds from a 3 million-year-old
boneyard in Ethiopia that promise to kindle fresh debate about the earliest
known human ancestors, a species best known for a dwarfish skeleton called
Lucy.;    After a 14-year period during which they were unable to visit
Ethiopia, researchers from the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley returned
to the Lucy site in the remote and desolate Afar region last October and found
18 major fossils from 15 individuals.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In 1974, paleoanthropologist Donald C. Johanson and his colleagues from the
institute stunned the anthropological community when they discovered the 3
1/2-foot-tall Lucy at Hadar. She was the oldest-known hominid, or member of
the human family, and was of an entirely new species.;    The new discoveries,
the researchers said Friday, confirm the first hominids' similarity to the
apes that preceded them, providing new insight into their evolutionary
biology.;    These fossils, said paleoanthropologist William Kimbel of the
Institute of Human Origins, will "throw fresh wood on the fire" of two ongoing
debates: whether another, more recent human ancestor coexisted with Lucy and
her kin, and whether humankind during the period were still partially
tree-dwellers or spent most of their time walking the vast savannas upright.; 
  Among their most important finds are a jawbone that looks very much like
those of 8 million- to 12 million-year-old apes that were long extinct when
Lucy inhabited the then-lush shores of a huge lake that preceded the Awash
River; an upper jaw that is contemporaneous with Lucy but that bears
characteristics of a later species; and an arm bone that was heavily muscled,
suggesting that it was used for climbing trees.;    The researchers also have
obtained new geological samples that they believe will be able to give them
much more precise dates for when Lucy and her family inhabited the region.;   
The Ethiopian site, called Hadar, lies at the northern end of the
4,000-mile-long geological structure called the East African Rift, which
continues southward through Kenya and Mozambique. Sediments laid down in the
rift over millions of years have been the source of many of the most famous
fossil finds that have illuminated the history of humankind.; IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; The Institute of Human Origins will hold a daylong public
symposium today. From 9 a.m. to 12 a.m., scientists will discuss finding the
Hadar fossils and their significance. From 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., they will discuss
geochronology -- the techniques of dating the fossils. The symposium costs $65
and will be held in Krutch Auditorium, 2601 Warring St., Berkeley.  </TEXT>
