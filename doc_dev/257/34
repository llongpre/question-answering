"Rediscover the U.S.A." is the theme for the United States' pavilion at the 
1992 World's Fair in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The design for the $8-million pavilion features 50,000 square feet of 
exhibition space, gardens and a state-of-the-art theater. The pavilion is 
intended to be symbolic of Columbus' voyage across the Atlantic in 1492, and in 
keeping with the Expo '92 theme of "The Age of Discovery." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, three sun shades in the form of sails rise above the pavilion, 
an allusion to Columbus' ships, and a 40-foot high waterfall cascades down the 
entranceway into a moat representing the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Barton Myers Associates of Los Angeles, the pavilion will be 
prefabricated in the United States and shipped to Seville for completeion by 
April, 1992. The focus of its exhibits will be trade and tourism, with every 
state and major city invited to participate.

Myanmar, Ya'll?: The nation of Myanmar, better known by its former name of 
Burma, has opened its first tourist office anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
And where did the Myanmarese choose to put it? New York City? London? Sydney? 
Wrong on all three. Instead, the office is in that crossroads of the world, 
Durham, N.C., which just happens to be the home of its managing director.

Smokescreen: Apparently bowing to pressure from smokers, Lufthansa has decided 
not to ban smoking on its domestic flights as originally planned. The airline 
cited fear of clashes between militant smokers and nonsmokers for its change of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that federal lawmakers in Germany had failed to pass anti-smoking 
legislation, Lufthansa said banning smoking on its flights could lead to 
"polarization and confrontations among passengers." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ban, which Lufthansa earlier said was supported by 90% of those 
passengers it surveyed, was to have gone into effect today.
