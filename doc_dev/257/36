   A sparrow-size creature of 135 million years ago
appears to be the oldest known bird that lived in trees and flew
with agility, a researcher says.
   The creature's feet showed that it lived in trees, while its
wing bones, breastbone and short clump of tail bones suggest an
ability for long-range agile flight, said Paul Sereno, who analyzed
a fossil specimen of the bird.
   The bird, not yet officially named, followed a primitive bird
called Archaeopteryx by about 10 million years.
   Archaeopteryx, which retained many dinosaur characteristics, was
basically a ground-dwelling bird that probably could climb trees,
jump and flap its wings to propel itself, Sereno said. But its
flight may have been rather short-range, he said.
   The new study provides ``a really exciting picture of a
transitional stage in the early stages of bird history,'' Sereno
said.
   The findings challenge assertions by some scientists that birds
essentially lived on the ground for 50 million to 100 million years
after Archaeopteryx, he said.
   That idea was questioned two years ago with the report of a
tree-dwelling bird from Spain that lived 125 million years ago, and
now the new report pushes tree-dwelling back 10 million years more,
Sereno said.
   Sereno, of the University of Chicago, was to present a
reconstruction of the fossil bird today at the annual meeting of
the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Lawrence, Kan.
   The specimen was found in 1987 in northeastern China. The
Beijing Natural History Museum, which owns the fossil, asked Sereno
for help in studying it.
   John Ostrom, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Yale
Peabody Museum of Nature History, said Sereno's interpretation of
the fossil appears reasonable.
   ``I would be a little bit hesitant to say that the specimen
demonstrates a tree-dwelling existence, but that's not outrageous.
It's reasonable on the basis of what he sees in the specimen,'' he
said.
   Ostrom said he has seen the reconstruction but not the specimen
itself. ``It was very definitely an advanced-level bird'' for that
period, showing that modern-day flying ability came about very
early in the history of birds, he said.
   Sereno said the bird, long extinct, retained some dinosaur
characteristics: movable fingers on the front edge of its wings, a
lack of fusion of many of its bones, and a club-shaped end of the
pubic bone that may have rested on the ground when the bird sat.
   Sereno said he suspects the bird had teeth, but none has been
firmly identified. Judging from its size, the bird probably ate
insects, probably catching them while it was flying, he said.
   It is not clear whether its appearance so soon after the more
primitive Archaeopteryx means that modern bird characteristics
evolved quickly, or that Archaeopteryx was hanging onto its more
primitive form while other birds, not yet discovered, evolved more
modern characteristics, Sereno said.
