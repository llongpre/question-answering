   The discovery of the fossilized bones of a giant
meat-eating dinosaur predating the fearsome tyrannosaurus rex
strengthens the theory that dinosaurs evolved rapidly before
becoming extinct, a scientist said Thursday.
   The bones of an Epanterias were found at the top of the Morrison
Formation deposit, an ancient saline lakebed near Fort Collins, by
a paleontology team from the University of Colorado Museum in
Boulder.
   The discovery a year and a half ago was only the third of an
Epanterias, according to Robert Bakker, a research associate at the
museum, who announced the find Wednesday.
   Bakker identified the giant member of the allosaur family from a
jawbone and parts of the neck and tail vertebrate.
   Bakker said the discover strengthens the theory that dinosaurs
entombed in the Morrison Formation, which dates to 130 million
years ago, and elsewhere in North America evolved rapidly.
   ``On average, the rule is that big animals tend to get bigger
until they go extinct. The incredible size of Epanterias indicates
there was some sort of an evolutionary arms race going on,'' Bakker
said in a telephone interview from Boulder.
   The Epanterias, which weighed about four tons and was 50 feet
long, could have eaten about 40 tons of meat annually, and its
ability to expand its enormous jaws _ much like modern-day snakes _
would have allowed Epanterias to gulp huge bites of prey easily.
   The Morrison Formation, about 50 miles north of Denver, contains
up to six distinct dinosaur fauna from successive time periods,
Bakker said.
   The formation is only about 300 feet deep, he said, ``but every
50 feet or so you have a different species. This one was only in
the last 20 feet and the earlier ones also were short-lived. Things
were really moving at that time.''
   The other two discoveries of Epanterias fossils were in 1877
near Canon City, 80 miles south of Denver, and in 1934 in the
Oklahoma panhandle.
   Epanterias apparently was the last and largest species in the
evolutionary line of allosaurs, carnivorous dinosaurs that walked
on their hind legs, Bakker said.
   Epanterias' great size confused early paleontologists, he said.
The bones of the Canon City specimen were so large they were
initially misidentified as brontosaur bones.
   Bakker speculated the size increase of many dinosaur species
over time may have been due to sexual selection, predation success
or disease resistance.
   He subscribes to the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded
like modern birds and that dinosaur mass extinctions about 66
million years ago may have been brought on by extensive migrations
and outbreaks of disease.
   Bakker said he and other researchers will study all three
Epanterias specimens and they hope to assemble a complete model
pieced together from portions of each dinosaur.
