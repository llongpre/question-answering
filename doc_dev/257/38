   A U.S.-Vietnamese scientific team has
found two human teeth believed to be 40,000 years old, an official
report said.
   The Vietnam News Agency reported the discovery in a recent
excavation at the Lang Trang Cave in the Ba Thuoc district of Thanh
Hoa province, 95 miles south of Hanoi.
   The report, dated Thursday, was monitored in Bangkok today.
   ``The teeth, one an incisor and the other a first molar,
unearthed from a layer of carbonate-rich clay sediment, are
believed to date to 40,000 years back, probably belonging to homo
sapiens,'' the report said.
   Recent archaeological finds have traced back about 500,000 years
the earliest human habitation of northern Vietnam.
   Also found in the sediment were animal fossils of 36 species and
23 families, the report said. It did not specify when the
discoveries were made.
   The team, set up by the Vietnam Archaeology Institute, included
Nguyen Van Hao, deputy head of the institute; paleontologist Le
Trung Kha; archaeologist John Olsen of the University of Arizona
and paleoanthropologist Russel Chioson of the University of Iowa.
   Olsen and Chioson were among scientists who in January journeyed
to Thanh Hoa to join Vietnamese scientists in searching a limestone
cave for remains of the ``gigantophithecus,'' an ape that became
extinct more than 200,000 years ago.
   They hoped to establish relationships among homo erectus, the
direct ancestors of modern humans, stone tools used by early man,
and the giant ape, since the remains of all three have been found
in that area.
   The excavation was one of the first joint scientific field
research projects in Vietnam in recent years. Diplomatic relations
have been blocked by Washington's opposition to Vietnam's
decade-old occupation of Cambodia, but private contacts have
increased substantially in recent years.
