<TEXT>  Summit Books, 189 pp., $17.95;  HUMAN beings are different from other animals,
and special in one important regard: We can communicate complex ideas. We can
articulate abstract thoughts. We have a language.;    Languages connect us,
and set us apart. English allows you to communicate with perhaps a third of
the world's people; your own type of English immediately identifies you by
nationality, region and even economic status. Languages allow us to store and
share information, to learn from our ancestors and pass stories along to our
descendents. Languages help us learn, and love. Languages make us human.;   
"A Man Without Words," by Berkeley resident Susan Schaller, is about living
without language, cut off from the world -- and about the long journey back
made by one man. Schaller, a San Jose State graduate, first studied American
Sign Language as a lark. Later she became an interpreter for the deaf, and
picked up a part-time job at a Los Angeles community college. And there she
met the man she calls Ildefonso.;    A Mexican-American laborer, Ildefonso,
27, had probably been deaf since birth. He had never learned to speak use sign
language or read lips. He had never been taught to read or write. He didn't
even know languages existed. Surrounded every day by millions of people, he
was almost utterly alone.;    We're used to melodramas about brave suffering,
and we know what to expect -- the big scene, the breakthrough, Patty Duke
running to the well in "The Miracle Worker," Daniel Day-Lewis reaching for the
chalk in "My Left Foot." So we may approach "A Man Without Words" expecting a
slow buildup to the happy moment when Ildefonso learns a way to communicate,
the big payoff when we can feel warm and satisfied and marvel at how lucky he
is to finally join the rest of us.;    But that scene comes early in the book
-- and without the slick satisfaction. By the second chapter Schaller has
managed to connect, to make the wordless man realize "cat" isn't just a
meaningless series of shapes, but a symbol for something else. It's a
bittersweet moment at best. At first Ildefonso is stunned, excited by the very
idea of language. Then, realizing what he's been cut off from all his life, he
begins to weep. Getting this new gift only makes him think of how little he's
had.;    The book could end there -- and would, if this were just a novel. But
this is real life, and Ildefonso's first word is just the beginning. Schaller
teaches him other words, and other languages (when he learns that there are
different words in Spanish and English for the same things, he weeps again.)
Schaller also teaches us a few things about American Sign Language and the
tyranny of the hearing. (Deaf children who can sign more fluently than their
teachers may still be diagnosed as having "low-functioning language skills.");
   She also discovers an entire subculture of deaf immigrants who meet in
their rented rooms and tell stories in pantomime. "Any sign that became
adopted by the entire group had to be repeated and tested in many different
stories, and tried by everyone. If they could not achieve total consensus, the
sign was dropped or remained the property of one person," Schaller writes. "I
felt as if a time machine had flown me back to the Neanderthal age, and I had
the privilege of witnessing the invention of language.";    Ildefonso still
goes to these informal meetings, but he's fluent in sign language now and able
to communicate with others outside the group. He's also in touch with his
world, although there are many things that still puzzle him. "I don't
understand why there's so much killing and war and stealing, people arguing
about who owns what," he signs to Schaller after seeing the evening news. "I
want some land and a place to live, but just a small place and a little land,
so I can have my own garden. There is enough in the world for everyone to have
a little garden.";    "A Man Without Words" is a slight book, and it
occasionally falters. Schaller's story of her struggle to write about
Ildefonso is hardly as compelling as his own history, and a chapter about
famous "languageless" youths of the 19th century -- Germany's Kasper Hauser,
France's "wild child" -- seems like padding. "A Man Without Words" is moving
and often compelling, but this is really Ildefonso's story. Perhaps one day he
can tell it himself.  </TEXT>
