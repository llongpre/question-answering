<TEXT>     (check) Football? I like the Redskins -- to beat the spread.;    (check)
The Bears-Giants game will be decided on penalty kicks.;    (check) In honor
of Coach Wimp Sanderson's wardrobe, the center circle of Alabama's basketball
floor has been painted plaid. Honest.;    (check) I wonder what Monica
Westhead, high school basketball coach in Torrance, thinks of Dad's doings in
Denver.;    (check) The best backup play-caller in the NFL might be Verne
Lundquist.;    (check) Pat Summerall, he of the booze-and-pain-pills diet,
would have been better off eating at True Value.;    (check) My tryout with
the Sacramento Kings is today. When is yours?;    (check) Rocket Ismail should
go pro, but Todd Marinovich? He should consider returning to high school.;   
(check) Reaction to the Glenn Davis trade: Maybe it's time we take the Houston
Astros away from John McMullen.;    (check) The Paul Landreaux Era at St.
Mary's was too long.;    (check) Boy, John MacLeod sure has turned things
around in New York. The Knicks, 7-8 when Stu Jackson was fired, are 14-18.;   
(check) Think Jennifer Azzi will be a hit in Italy? Perfect.;    (check)
Dennis Rasmussen ought to be ashamed of himself, a left-handed pitcher making
only $805,000 in this day and age.;    (check) Ben Johnson's coach, Charlie
Francis, has been banned from Canadian track and field for life, so he won't
be around for the next year or two.;    (check) The University of New Orleans
has a basketball player named Ervin Johnson. Do you suppose his nickname is
Mgic?;    (check) Not to defend Buddy Ryan, but the way Randall Cunningham was
throwing, I might have changed pitchers, too.;    (check) I think Bill
Parcells said it best, and meanest: "Buddy Ryan is a Neanderthal and he
attracts Neanderthal players," the Giants' coach says in his book.
"Neanderthals can win certain kinds of wars, but they lose some they should
win if you find a way to make them make enough choices.";    (check) At 11
cents an hour and no gambling, Pete Rose was making more in prison than he was
on the outside.;    (check) When I see the name of Norwegian skier Atle
Skaardal, my mind flashes to a former Giants pitcher and a diet.;    (check) I
hope Don Robinson finds a way into the Giants' rotation, because I sure do
like watching him bat.;    (check) Oregon basketball coach Don Monson, after
beating Stanford: "There's no question that the crowd maybe was the
difference." No question whatsoever, maybe.;    (check) They should put Alan
Wiggins' face on an anti-drug poster. What a shame.;    (check) Ralph Sampson
is playing more minutes than Jim Petersen these days.;    (check) Dexter
Carter has made as many tackles this season as Fred Smerlas -- one.;   
(check) You know, owning your own helicopter can be such fun at times.;   
(check) Memo to Jim Palmer: No.;    (check) Bravo to the NCAA, for giving it
the old college try.;    (check) I figure Mike Jorgensen got his Hall of Fame
vote  from the same guy who honored Jeff Burroughs, Richie Hebner, Mike
Hargrove, Burt Hooton, John Lowenstein and Ellis Valentine.;    (check) I take
back most of the bad things I've said over the years about Dominique Wilkins.;
   (check) Can't understand why Bobby Ross won't leave Georgia Tech to coach
the Cleveland Browns.;    (check) Golden Trio? Well, if you insist.;   
(check) Welcome (halfway) home, Pete.  </TEXT>
