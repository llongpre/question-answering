   The oldest dinosaur may have been shorter than
former basketball star Wilt Chamberlain and lighter than football
star William ``Refrigerator'' Perry.
   It was puny for a dinosaur. It scampered along on the toes of
its rear feet but had ``large claws on its forelimbs, used to grasp
prey,'' said University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno.
   More importantly, Sereno and other scientists said Thursday they
believe the first drawing of the ancient Herrerasaurus may reveal
important clues into the evolution of dinosaurs.
   ``Before, only a few bones of Herrerasaurus were known,'' said
Sereno. ``Now, we have everything.
   ``Basically we have the first relatively complete idea of what
the primitive form of the dinosaur looks like. This will help us in
trying to figure out the pathways of evolution that proceeded over
the course of many millions of years after that.''
   Scientists welcomed Sereno's work, presented Thursday in Austin,
Texas, at meetings of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists.
   ``I think it's extremely important to know what the thing looks
like in detail,'' said Nicholas Hotton, curator of fossils,
amphibians and reptiles at the Smithsonian National Museum of
Natural History. ``If you've got that kind of information, you can
tell which way evolution is going.''
   Sereno said the artist's reconstruction of the dinosaur _ named
after an Argentine goat herder _ was based largely on the recent
discovery of a skull and two nearly complete skeletons in South
America.
   Working with South American colleagues Alfredo Monetta and Jose
Bonaparte, Sereno discovered the fossils in the foothills of the
Andes.
   ``There is definitely a certain amount of good fortune in these
things,'' said Sereno, who last month won a $500,000 Packard
Foundation Award that will allow him to continue work on the
Herrerasaurus and other research projects, including a study of
ancient birds.
   The Herrerasaurus, which scampered the Earth some 230 million
years ago, was Earth's first true dinosaur. ``Basically, you go
back further and you get dinosaur-type things but not a dinosaur,''
he said.
   Herrerasaurus weighed a mere 300 pounds and stood between 6 feet
and 8 feet tall, Sereno said. The Chicago Bears' Perry weighs in at
325 pounds, while Chamberlain stands 7 feet, 1 inch high.
   Like all other dinosaurs, Herrerasaurus roamed the earth for
only a few million years before becoming extinct. Scientists aren't
sure what doomed the tiny first dinosaur, Sereno said.
   With the new representation of the animal, ``We finally have
some idea of the path of history,'' he said.
