In the Age of Mankind: A Smithsonian Book of Human Evolution by Roger Lewin 
(Smithsonian Institution Press; $37.50; 256 pages; illustrated) 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to say that human beings evolved from lower animals and very hard to 
say exactly how it happened. As in most areas of knowledge, the closer you look 
at the details, the fuzzier they get. 
</P>
<P>
At every stage in the story of human evolution there are puzzles and scholarly 
debates. The evidence -- some of it very sketchy -- can be read in many 
different ways, and each way has its adherents. Very little is settled. 
</P>
<P>
"Archeology is a detective story in which all the principal characters are 
absent and only a few broken fragments of their possessions remain," says 
Richard Leakey, one of the foremost practitioners in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Lewin, a science writer and biochemist with a special interest in 
evolution, explores the questions, the controversies and the evidence 
surrounding the origins of the human race in "In the Age of Mankind," a 
lavishly illustrated survey of current knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Origin of Language 
</P>
<P>
He masterfully traces the coming of human beings biologically and culturally, 
paying as much attention to the origin of language and of cities as to the 
descent from the trees. Though the book is somewhat dryly written, the content 
of the prose makes up for what it lacks in style. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing part of the story is how much of it remains a mystery; 130 years 
after Charles Darwin published his "Origin of Species," it is still not clear 
at what point our ancestors stopped being apelike and started being humanlike. 
It is not even clear what the criteria are for making that judgment. What is 
clear, Lewin says, is that humans are different in degree but not in kind from 
the animals that preceded us. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, human behavior was ascribed to our hominid ancestors at a 
fairly early stage in their development. The tide of expert opinion on this 
subject has now shifted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primitive Versions 
</P>
<P>
"Our ancestors now appear to be more like apes than like primitive versions of 
ourselves," Lewin writes. 
</P>
<P>
Stone tools began to be used about 2.5 million years ago, but it was not until 
Homo erectus came along nearly a million years later that something different 
happened. He "was the first to use his environment as a modern hunter-gatherer 
does, and the first whose anatomy speaks of a humanlike social structure," 
Lewin says. "For the first time, the Age of Mankind seemed at hand. Before 
then, however, the menagerie of hominid species inhabiting various parts of 
Africa lived the lives of intelligent, large-bodied, terrestrial primates, some 
of whom made and used stone tools." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crossed the Bridge 
</P>
<P>
Still, modern humans did not arise until somewhere between 200,000 and 150,000 
years ago, and they did not leave Africa until between 100,000 and 35,000 years 
ago. When they crossed the then-existent land bridge between Asia and North 
America remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
When did they begin to speak? When did they develop consciousness? When did the 
hunter-gatherers settle down and turn to agriculture? No one knows. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it clear, as long thought, that language was developed for the purpose 
of hunting. It now appears that the spur to communication was the need for 
social organization. This helps to explain why humans have to be so much 
cleverer than animals, who, after all, manage to make a living in their 
environments with much less brain power. 
</P>
<P>
"While primates' subsistence environment may be no more complex than that of 
other mammals, their social environment is much more demanding," Lewin writes. 
"More and more, language is coming to be seen as a tool of consciousness: a way 
of thinking better, a way of more effectively reconstructing a picture of our 
social world in our heads." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Cities 
</P>
<P>
Finally, social organization led to cities, which began in Mesopotamia only 
6,000 years ago. Civilization and modern society began in the city of Uruk 
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"At Uruk, to a degree unimagined in earlier phases of human history, there 
emerged the need for control of uncertainty; control not only over the physical 
elements of nature but over fellow human beings," Lewin says. "Once you had 
Uruk, New York was probably inevitable: The true city, once formed, generates a 
whole new array of social and technological selection pressures that set a new 
trajectory in human history." 
</P>
<P>
But how all this happened is a matter of great controversy. There is no 
clear-cut distinction between causes and effects. Different stories can be put 
together from the same sketchy facts. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin's book is an up-to-the-minute presentation of those stories that 
underscores what is known, what is unknown and what is guessed at. We still 
have a long way to go before we can answer humanity's age-old question: Where 
did we come from and how did we get here?
