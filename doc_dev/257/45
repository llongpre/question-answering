   The first known remains of a giant lizard that
may have dined on baby dinosaurs have been found in Mongolia, a
researcher says.
   The 80-million-year-old skull and forelimb were a highlight of
the first expedition to that country by Western paleontologists in
65 years, said Michael Novacek.
   The lizard, which apparently resembled today's Komodo dragon,
was perhaps 8 feet long and may have been a juvenile, Novacek said.
It may have eaten young dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs, he said.
   Its fossil remains were found in the Gobi Desert, near a
dinosaur nesting site that contained eight eggs, he said.
   The Komodo dragon is the largest living lizard, reaching a
length of more than 11 feet in Southeast Asian jungles. Novacek
said the animal has been known to attack and consume adult humans.
   Novacek is vice president and dean of science at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York. He and museum colleagues
Malcolm McKenna and Mark Norell recently undertook the month-long
expedition at the invitation of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences.
   The American researchers and Mongolian counterparts also found
100-million-year-old remains of shrew-sized mammals, which may shed
light on the spread of the ancestors of modern mammals, he said.
   They also found two unusually well-preserved skeletons of
protoceratops, a beaked dinosaur that grew 4 to 5 feet long, and
one of an armored dinosaur called an ankylosaur, which grew 15 to
20 feet long, Novacek said. The fossils were about 80 million years
old.
   The wealth of discoveries from the relatively brief expedition
gives hope that further work will turn up much more material, he
said. The museum and the Mongolian academy signed an agreement for
three more expeditions over the next three years, he said.
   Mongolia contains ``a tremendous potential for exploration that
you don't see in North America,'' with areas the size of Wyoming
that have not been explored, he said.
