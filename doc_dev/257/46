   Archaeologists have unearthed an ancient
cemetery in northern Israel and say the 3,000-year-old finds
indicate the Phoenicians were landlubbers before they went to sea
and dominated the Mediterranean.
   The Phoenicians emerged about 1,000 B.C. and established
city-states throughout the Mediterranean Basin from Lebanon to
Spain, surviving until Roman times.
   Pottery, jewelry and other remains of their cities show a
variety of influences from Greek cultures in the Aegean as well as
ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.
   But little is known of the origins of the ancient Phoenicians.
   Evidence uncovered by a Hebrew University team in the tombs at
Achziv near Israel's border with Lebanon point to a Semitic
background, either from the ancient land of Israel, also known as
Canaan, or further inland.
   The team declined to give a specific location of the cemetery
for fear of plunderers; they believe artifacts and gold may be
buried in the tombs.
   Elat Mazar, an archaeologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
said the architecture of the tombs carved into the bedrock linked
the early Phoenicians to the ancient Hittites, a Semitic people who
lived in what is now Turkey and Syria and had no significant
sailing tradition.
   ``We found a hole in the ceiling on the tomb which is
characteristic of Hittite burial chambers,'' she said. ``In their
cult of the dead, it was a symbolic link between the living world
and the world of the dead.''
   She added that the Phoenicians had a sophisicated society with
advanced sailing technology, refined tastes in jewelry and an
unparalled ability to adapt material from other cultures.
   ``There is no question they were more developed than the
Israelite culture of the time. They were Semitic and close to the
Israelites but different.''
   The pack-rat characteristic of borrowing from neighboring
societies made the Phoenicians something of a mystery, however.
   Patricia Smith, a British-born anthropologist and dentist
interviewed at her laboratory in Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital,
said a study of the ancient human remains show the physical
features of the Phoenicians were Semitic.
   ``This was no Greek,'' said Ms. Smith, turning the skull of a
Phoenician and pointing to the wide skull, arch of the nose and the
high cheekbones. A cast of an Israelite skull from the same eighth
to seventh century B.C. period had similar features.
   From his teeth, Smith deduced that the man, 45 to 50 years old
when he died, suffered either from fever or hunger in his infancy
but was quite fit as an adult, with not a single tooth cavity.
   ``Apart from this hole in his head, he was very healthy,'' Smith
said of the Phoenician, who died of a powerful blow to the back of
his head, apparently struck by a heavy blunt instrument.
   The Israeli expedition unearthed about 50 skeletons from two
cave tombs measuring about 10 feet by 10 feet. The cemetery covers
seven acres and may contain the remains of thousands of Phoenicians
spanning almost the entire 1,000-year life of their society here.
   Ms. Smith said she hoped to use the remains, especially the
skulls, to recreate the general ``Phoenician look.''
   ``It will be very exiting to find out who the Phoenicians were.''
   Ms. Smith uses video cameras and still photography to recreate
faces. She employed the technique on behalf of the prosecution in
the trial of John Demjanjuk, a Cleveland, Ohio, autoworker
convicted last year in Israel of Nazi war crimes and sentenced to
death.
   She made a video that superimposed a recent video image of
Demjanjuk on a 40-year-old Nazi identity card to show it was the
same man.
   With the Phoenicians, she plans to use the same technique to
superimpose video images from ancient drawings of Phoenicians and
modern sketches over the skulls themselves.
   ``I would be able to define a type, but not an individual. We
should be able to tell how varied the Phoenicians were,'' she said,
explaining that a perfect re-creation was impossible without
knowing the features of soft tissue such as eyelids, ears and lips.
