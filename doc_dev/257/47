   Scientific sleuths can rest easy. A Queens
College professor says he's solved the decades-old mystery of who
masterminded the 1912 Piltdown Man fraud. And it wasn't Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle.
   The Sherlock Holmes author was one of the more colorful
``suspects'' named over the years as perpetrating a hoax that threw
many paleontologists off the trail of what is now recognized as the
course of human evolution.
   Others included several noted scientists, a counterfeit jeweler
and a philosopher-priest.
   But Frank Spencer, an anthropologist who has worked on the famous
whodunit since the 1970s, said in a telephone interview Tuesday
there was never any proof linking the usual suspects.
   He says diary entries and other information uncovered
independently by himself and Australian historian Ian Langham points
the finger squarely at Sir Arthur Keith, a well-respected English
anatomist.
   The Langham-Spencer theory is laid out in two books to be
published this fall by Oxford University Press. Langham, who worked
at the University of Sydney, died in 1984. His widow asked Spencer
to continue his work.
   Piltdown, a small village in England, made international news in
1912 when a skull and other artifacts were discovered by Sussex
lawyer Charles Dawson in a gravel pit.
   ``It was sensational because it offered a completely different
view of evolution at the time,'' Spencer said.
   For those who believed that humans with already enlarged brains
evolved earlier than had been supposed, the Piltdown Man was supreme
proof. Spencer says Keith, conservator of the Hunterian Museum of
the Royal College of Surgeons who died in 1955, was one of the chief
cheerleaders of the theory before Piltdown was unearthed.
   The discovery was debunked in 1953 when scientists learned the
remains were a human skull only a couple of hundred years old with
an orangutan's jaw joined to it.
   ``The general feeling was it was contrived to bring somebody
down, make someone in the scientific community look silly,'' Spencer
said. ``But if that was the case, why didn't they do that?''
Instead, the theory floated around the scientific community for 41
years.
   ``It makes far more sense when beginning to look at the evidence
that Piltdown was something made to withstand scientific scrutiny.''
   Spencer says the Piltdown bones were stained to make them look
prehistoric and the orangutan teeth were filed down to make them
look more like those of a meat-eating human, a ruse Keith had the
knowledge and wherewithal to accomplish.
   But the crux of the Langham-Spencer proof lies in Keith's
diaries. In them, Spencer says, Keith ``indicates he had information
about the site and events at Piltdown ... information which he
wouldn't have had unless he was an inside member of the group.''
   Spencer said Keith also had met with Dawson a year before the
discovery and again, just several months before.
   ``In reconstructing the Langham thesis and other evidence I
found, I think we've come up with a substantial case,'' Spencer said.
   Others may disagree.
   ``Is this the end of the Piltdown affair?'' Dr. William Ball, a
former keeper of paleontology at the British Museum, said when asked
by The New York Times to respond to Spencer's claims.
   ``Until such time as an unequivocal, signed and detailed
confession comes to light, and one that can be shown to fit the
facts as we now know them, I rather doubt it.''
