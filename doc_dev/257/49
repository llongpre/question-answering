Today's edition of USA Today carried a letter signed by more than 175 of the 
newspaper's 426 newsroom employees, saying they were "offended, outraged and 
embarrassed" by USA Today founder Al Neuharth's suggestion that airlines should 
make the skies friendlier by bringing back shapely, young "sky girls." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also carried an interview with the head of the Assn. of Flight 
Attendants, who said union members were "stunned" by the former Gannett Co. 
Inc. chairman's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling was that Al Neuharth is either a Neanderthal or some sort of court 
jester," said Susan Bianchi-Sand, 42, who added that she has been a flight 
attendant for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a column last Friday, Neuharth said he began taking commercial flights for 
the first time in 19 years after his recent retirement, and did not like what 
he found. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the young, attractive, enthusiastic female flight attendants -- then 
called stewardesses -- have been replaced by aging women who are tired of their 
jobs or by flighty young men who have trouble balancing a cup of coffee or 
tea," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
If he were running an airline, Neuharth said he would "ease today's cabin 
pressures" for passengers by insisting on old-fashioned vital statistics for 
"sky girls": unmarried female nurses, under age 25, measuring 5-foot-4 or less 
and weighing under 115 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We say this is bigoted and insulting -- not only to flight attendants and 
nurses, but also to the women and men who work for Gannett," the employee 
letter said.
