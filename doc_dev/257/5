   Forget notions of Neanderthal man as a
giant hairy brute who stumbled about, managing utterances no more
sophisticated than an occasional ``ugh'' or ``duh.''
   Neanderthal man could talk, researchers say. He couldn't
pronounce the letters ``e'' or ``i,'' and he probably sounded a bit
nasal and hard to understand, but he could communicate.
   Neanderthals even may have spun yarns, whispered gossip, and told
a few one-liners, says Terrence Deacon, assistant professor of
anthropology at Harvard University.
   What's more, they may have talked with early humans, and if they
did, remnants of Neanderthal language could be found in modern
speech, says Deacon.
   About 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals living in Europe and Israel
were invaded by a race of smaller folk _ modern humans _ who had
migrated from Africa. For thousands of years the two cultures
mingled, and quite possibly communicated, before Neanderthals died
out 35,000 years ago, Deacon said.
   Neanderthals ``had every bit of the intellectual and linguistic
capability'' that our direct ancestors did, Deacon said Wednesday.
``They could have conversed with modern humans.''
   Deacon bases this contention on his studies of monkey and human
brains. His research showed that an area called the ventral
prefontal cortex, which grew dramatically in modern human brains,
serves as a link between speech centers controlling so-called
automatic vocalizations _ laughter and crying _ and those areas
controlling more sophisticated speech.
   The development of this large cortex distinguished humans from
primates, which use automatic vocalizations like shrieks and hoots
to communicate. Since Neanderthal brains also had a large ventral
prefrontal cortex, it is reasonable to assume they could talk,
Deacon said.
   Neanderthal man was a big guy, to be sure. He had larger bones
and muscles, a sloping forehead and more menacing jaws and teeth
than today's average human, but his brain was much like ours. There
is no reason he wouldn't have the gift of gab, Deacon said.
   He couldn't utter some of the vowels we do, though, because his
larynx was higher in his throat than ours. So he couldn't ``ooh'' if
he spied a beautiful full moon, for example.
   Philip Lieberman, professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences
at Brown University, agreed with some of Deacon's argument.
   But Lieberman said that while he'd ``be astonished if they didn't
talk ... whether they spoke anything like humans is an unsettled
issue.
   ``The difference in the vocal tract means the Neanderthal
couldn't close his nose off,'' Lieberman said, noting this would
make Neanderthal speech very nasal, which added errors to any
language.
   Lieberman added that Neanderthal speech also would be hampered by
not being able to say ``e'' or ``i,'' the most common sounds found
in modern languages.
   Deacon said much of what an anthropologist believes about
Neanderthal man's capacities depend upon what is considered crucial
to speech.
   ``It all comes down to what you think is more important for
speech _ the brain or the larynx,'' Deacon said. ``I believe it is
the brain.''
   Deacon's argument may have gained strength recently with the
discovery of a human-like hyoid bone, from which the larynx is
suspended, in the 60,000-year-old skeleton of a Neanderthal on Mount
Carmel in Israel.
   If Neanderthals and modern humans talked, there also may be some
aspects of Neanderthal speech left in modern languages, Deacon said.
   ``It's an open question, but it's not impossible that our
language was affected,'' Deacon said.
   So what did Neanderthals talk about? They were hunters and
gatherers, much like the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in Africa,
so they probably talked about the animals they hunted and the
berries they gathered for food.
   But not all Neanderthal communication was shop talk.
   ``They didn't just talk about their jobs,'' Deacon said. ``I
think they could have told jokes. And there were issues of family,
shelter, disease and aging that they might have discussed. And of
course, there was the play of children.
   ``It's a disservice to the complexity of their society to think
of Neanderthals as dumb brutes,'' Deacon said.
   Perhaps they joked about the puny Homo sapiens who invaded their
turf.
   Say, did you hear the one about the human who thought
Neanderthals were dumb?
