  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 8 Mar [date as received] 
(ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
announced today that he will act with a "firm hand" against the 
terrorists, whom he labelled "Neanderthals" who started a wave 
of political violence in the country. He also dismissed the 
possibility of decreeing a state of emergency. 
  "Unfortunately, there are people in Guatemala who think like 
Neanderthals, and for many years they have fought ideas with 
bullets, not with words," he said. Upon reiterating his 
condemnation of the murder of Constitutional Court President 
Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April and the attack against Deputy 
Obdulio Chinchilla on Wednesday, De Leon emphasized that he is 
"worried" about the recent violence. 
  "The government rejects any kind of violence and will act 
strongly to counter it," the president told reporters. He added 
that security forces have been given precise instructions to get 
to the bottom of their investigations and find the people 
responsible for Gonzalez' murder and the attack against 
Chinchilla. 
  De Leon pointed out that Guatemala must enter without 
further 
delay a phase of reconciliation to stop the violence and the 
civil war that began in 1960 so it can achieve welfare and 
social development. The president asked the groups causing the 
violence to reconsider and reflect on the "serious damage" they 
are doing the country through their actions. "It is not 
violence but dialogue that will solve our problems," the 
president emphasized. [passage omitted]
