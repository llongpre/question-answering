A VIEW TO A DEATH IN THE MORNING
by Matt Cartmill
Harvard Pounds 23.95, 331 pages
I HATE hunting and huntsmen. At least I think I do. Certainly I hate
violence. And the thought of killing things - foxes, game-birds, polar
bears, people - makes me glow with fury. I believe that huntsmen are
primitives: viciously non-intelligent throw-backs to the time when our
ancestors first came down from the trees. I believe them to be prisoners of
the same gorily malfunctioning maleness that leads to wars and death camps.
If you ask me, they have grievous sexual hang-ups. I would like to stamp on
their faces, shoot them, poison them, spear them and boil them up.
On the other hand, I am in the grip of the notion that humans are only
animals: that we are only chimpanzees and that we have a long way to go,
evolutionarily speaking, before our achievements and our traits signify any
real divergence from the rest of the animal kingdom. It follows, from this,
that although I hate huntsmen - would like to stab and gas them - I somehow
absolve them: they are prisoners of their genes.
Confusing? Then you ought to read this excellent book, to discover just how
confusing the subject of hunting and human nature really is.
Matt Cartmill is a professor in the department of biological anthropology
and anatomy at Duke University in the US, and his book a brilliantly
well-realised study of the connections that have been drawn between hunting
and being human.
As he states at the outset: 'It deals above all with the hunting hypothesis
of human origins, which is the story of how some apes became human when they
took up weapons and began to kill. The killer-ape story has roots in older
tales, and so this book is in part a literary history. But it is also a book
about science, because scientists have been the chief tellers of that
story.' The professor starts his story near its end, by tracing the rise and
ascendancy of the hunting hypothesis - our notion of homo sapiens as lunatic
killer apes - in anthropological thought after the end of the second world
war. The hypothesis collapsed during the 1970s, and Cartmill asks why such a
flimsy story, with such unpalatable implications, was accepted for so long.
'What do we get out of seeing ourselves as sick, disordered animals - and
why should anyone think that the origins of our sickness are somehow tied to
hunting?'
His arguments - and answers - cover Greek myth and literature; the impact of
Christian revisionism; the emergence, in the Renaissance, of the view of the
hunt as symbol of tyranny and object of moral indignation; the link, from
the 17th century, between the growth of anti-hunting sentiment and the
growth of science; the blurring of boundaries between people and beasts; the
Romantic reaction against science; the Darwinian view of nature as - in fact
 -a struggle for existence (cited as a justification for hunting); and the
'Bambi syndrome' - fear of war mingled with Romantic reverence for nature
and Freudian pessimism about man.
At the end, the good professor expresses doubts about the meaning and
reality of the distinctions we draw between artifice and nature, and between
people and animals.
Was hunting really an important factor in human origins? The author says it
is a safe bet that hunting assumed an increased importance during the course
of our evolution from our chimpanzee-like ancestors. But he says there is
nothing to imply that hunting made us human.
On the other hand: 'Even if hunting does not have the causal importance that
anthropologists once attributed to it, it may still be linked to some
essential human taint, some fundamental disorder or sickness that makes the
human condition peculiarly tragic or dangerous. If so, we ought not to
disregard the myth of the killer ape.'
Professor Shipman is justifiably regarded as an extremely important
evolutionary essayist - one whose hallmarks are erudition, stylishness, wit
and piercing humanity. He really is a good chimpanzee.
In five days' time, members of the numskull upper English and Scottish
class, their grubby clients in tow, will be poncing across the moorland and
cocking their firearms for the 'Glorious Twelfth' - the start of the
grouse-shooting season. The experience will cost them a fortune. For a
fraction of the cost, they could buy this book and start to get an
education. But I don't suppose they will.
