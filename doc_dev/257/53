   Mayor David N. Dinkins appealed for a healing of
racial divisions after a judge handed down maximum prison terms to
two young white men for their roles in the mob attack that left a
black teen-ager dead.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens imposed the sentences Monday for what a
prosecutor called ``Neanderthal-type'' behavior by whites who
jumped and shot 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins after he ventured into
mostly white Bensonhurst on Aug. 23.
   Joseph Fama, 19, named by prosecutors as the triggerman, was
sentenced to 32 and two-thirds years to life in prison for murder
and other crimes.
   Keith Mondello, 19, identified as the ringleader, drew five and
one-third to 16 years in prison, plus a $2,000 fine. He had been
acquitted of murder and manslaughter but convicted of riot and
other offenses.
   Fama and Mondello each must serve the lower range of their
sentences before they become eligible for parole.
   The slaying heightened racial tensions during the campaign that
resulted in Dinkins' election as New York's first black mayor. The
verdict in Mondello's case in May set off rock- and bottle-throwing
melees by blacks in Brooklyn.
   In a statement from City Hall, Dinkins said ``the stiff
sentences imposed today speak for themselves.''
   Now that the criminal justice system has spoken, we all must
join our hearts, heads and hands together to rid our city of the
racism that destroys lives and communities,'' he said. ``We have
had enough of tragedy. Together, we must and we will move the
healing process forward.''
   When Fama's sentence was read in the packed courtroom, the
victim's father, Moses Stewart, murmured ``Yes!'' Later, Stewart
called the ruling ``a small joy for myself but a great victory for
black people all over the state.''
   Members of Fama's family screamed in Italian and wept. ``Not my
son! Not my son!'' shouted his mother, Josephine Fama.
   Hawkins and three friends had gone to the Brooklyn neighborhood
to look at a used car. A mob of whites, having been warned by
Mondello's ex-girlfriend about ``outsiders,'' set upon the black
teen-agers with baseball bats.
   Assistant District Paul Burns, arguing for the maximum term,
called the killing ``a Neanderthal-type of behavior.''
   ``We need to send the message to every community that we will
not tolerate senseless violence,'' the prosecutor said.
   Mondello's attorney, Stephen Murphy, told the judge, ``I believe
that the law should rise above public opinion.''
   On Monday, jury selection began for co-defendant John Vento, and
trial dates were set for five other young men accused in the case.
   Vento, 21, is charged with murder as well as riot, assault and
other crimes. He faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of
murder.
