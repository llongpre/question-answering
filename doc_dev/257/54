   Scientists excavating an ancient lake shore in
Virginia say a concentration of fossils there dates from a time
when the area was a lush tropical forest and creatures resembling
armored monsters roamed the Earth.
   Hans-Dieter Sues, a Smithsonian Institution paleobiologist, said
Thursday that the rich collection of fossil remains are from a
variety of animals that lived 225 million years ago and some are of
a type never before found.
   ``Many of these are not known because rocks from this particular
chunk of time are not found anywhere else in the world,'' said Sues
in an interview. ``This is the first time that we've got a really
diverse group of land animals from this part of geologic time.''
   Sues said the largest assembled fossil includes the body, but
not the head, of a five-foot-long reptile resembling an
armor-plated crocodile.
   ``This creature had two rows on its back of this very massive
bony plate and huge spines sticking out on the side,'' said Sues.
``It's like something from a Japanese monster movie. It is a
funny-looking creature and an entirely new type of animal.''
   Sues said the Triassic period fossils were found in a formation
of stone called mudrock about 15 miles southwest of Richmond.
   The assemblage includes many fossils from a group of animals
called cynodonts, the closest reptile ancestors of the mammal. Sues
said the fossils include parts for a cynodont about the size of a
small dog, and other parts from a mammal-like reptile measuring 5
to 10 inches long.
   Sues said fragments of fossils of this type have been found in
the northern hemisphere, but never in such a large group.
Individual cynodont fossils also have been found in Argentina,
Brazil and in southern Africa.
   ``This is further evidence for the super continent of Pangaea,
when all of the continents were one large giant land mass,'' he
said, because fossils from the same species and the same era can be
found on continents that now are separated.
   It is thought that during the geologic period called Triassic,
between 240 to 205 million years ago, all of the Earth's land area
was connected in one large mass called Pangaea. The land mass
slowly split apart, as massive plates drifted away from each other
over millions of years, and the continents and islands eventually
arranged themselves in their present positions.
   Sues said that when the cynodonts and other creatures lived in
what is now Virginia, the area was near the equator and the climate
was tropical and humid, with lush vegetation.
   ``You had these huge fresh water lakes and rivers throughout the
whole area,'' he said. ``You had an incredible variety of animals.
There were plant eaters and a whole variety of meat eaters.''
   Sues said the cynodont fossils found in the assemblage include
five very small jaw bones, apparently from hatchlings, six larger
jaw bones, and the back bone and head from a still-larger animal.
   ``The cynodonts were creatures that were the precursors for true
mammals,'' he said. ``They are not mammals themselves, but were
species that gave rise to mammals.''
   One of the small jaw fossils is attached to a detailed mold of
the brain, and Sues said this may enable scientists to learn more
about how the mammalian brain developed.
   Most of the Triassic period reptiles died out as dinosaurs began
to evolve into the dominant animal, around the time the first
mammal is thought to have evolved.
   ``This find gives further evidence that mammals and dinosaurs
probably evolved at the same time,'' Sues said. ``The dinosaur
became very successful and remained successful for the next 140
million years and mammals were sort of pushed over the side and
only became important and successful after the dinosaurs went
extinct.''
   Dinosaurs became extinct, for reasons still not understood,
about 65 million years ago, and mammals, such as mankind, evolved
into the dominant animal.
   The fossil deposit was found by Paul E. Olsen, a geologist with
the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.
   Olsen was conducting a survey in the area in 1985, Sues said,
and chanced onto a small fossil. Sues identified it as a cynodont
part and the National Geographic Society supported further
exploration leading to the discovery of the large fossil deposit.
