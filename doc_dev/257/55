   Archaeologists who wear wet suits and
diving tanks are rescuing relics from an 8,000-year-old village 40
feet beneath the sea before water destroys the last remnants of the
ancient site.
   The village, which contains the remains of more than a dozen
stone houses, wells and cooking hearths, lies about 400 yards off
the Mediterranean coast, some 10 miles south of Haifa.
   ``It is the best-preserved, neolithic, underwater site in the
world,'' said Ehud Galili of the University of Haifa's Institute of
Archaeology and Maritime Studies. ``We are carrying out a rescue
operation because sea abrasion may soon destroy the site.''
   Each day for two weeks late this summer _ a search period
limited by sea conditions and funding _ Galili and about 10
archaelogists and volunteer divers headed out in a rubber dinghy in
twos or threes for hour-long underwater stints. One operates a
dredger to clear away sand as others search for artifacts.
   The project, in its fifth year, has yielded 15 human skeletons,
many of them almost intact; animal and fish bones; several pounds
of cultivated wheat and lentils; and stone and bone utensils,
including arrowheads, knives and bowls.
   ``Most neolithic sites are in poor condition,'' said University
of Pittsburgh underwater archaeologist Jim Dwyer, who returned this
year to Atlit for the second year in a row. ``Here we have the
chance to find everything ancient man used in day-to-day life.''
   The underwater village is the only neolithic site along the
Israeli coast containing skeletons, according to Galili.
Pathologists studying the bones are discovering details about how
people lived in the period 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, before they
learned to use pottery or discovered writing.
   The studies show, for example, that one villager suffered from
arthritis and another was paralyzed from the waist down. One used
his teeth excessively _ to string fishing nets, Galili believes _
while another rowed a great deal.
   At least nine other sciences associated with archaeology have
been applied to the findings, he said. ``We have studied the pollen
of flowers to learn about the climate of the period, and applied
carbon 14 tests to determine how old the site is.''
   Galili was particularly excited to discover cultivated wheat
because it helped place the village in the neolithic period, when
man, after 1.5 million years of hunting and foraging, first began
to cultivate his own food.
   ``We found several pounds of wheat and lentils,'' he said.
``Apparently a process of domestication began at this time.''
   The excavators also found remnants of wild boar and gazelle,
indicating that the villagers remained part-time hunters.
   ``The village was well-located. It was on the sea but protected
by a bay. Nearby there was a fresh stream and swamps where cattle
lived,'' Galili said. That changed as the planet became warmer,
melting glaciers and raising the sea level by up to 100 yards,
submerging the village.
   For thousands of years, sand also covered the submerged village,
hiding it and maintaining the artifacts in good condition. This
began to change 20 years ago, said Galili. ``The findings became
exposed. Man intervened in nature and upset the balance. They took
sand for construction and built breakers in the sea. The sand began
to disappear.''
