   Two 19-year-old white men on Monday were dealt
the longest possible prison terms for the mob-beating and death of
a young black man who had come to their neighborhood to buy a car.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens handed down the sentences after a
prosecutor called the slaying ``Neanderthal-type behavior'' by the
white mob.
   The Aug. 23 shooting death of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins in
Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section inflamed racial passions in the city.
   ``It's a small joy for myself but a great victory for black
people all over the state,'' Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, said
after the sentencings.
   Owens sentenced Joseph Fama, named by prosecutors as the
triggerman, to 32 and two-thirds years to life in prison. He was
convicted of second-degree murder, riot, unlawful imprisonment,
weapons possession and other crimes.
   Defense lawyer David DePetris said he would appeal and added
that he wasn't surprised.
   Earlier, Owens handed Keith Mondello five and one-third to 16
years in prison, plus a $2,000 fine. Mondello, identified as the
ringleader, had been acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges,
but convicted of riot, unlawful imprisonment and discrimination.
   As Owens delivered Fama's sentence in the packed courtroom,
Stewart watched intently and said: ``Yes!''
   Hawkins' mother, Diane Hawkins, put her head on his shoulder and
cried as she looked at Fama.
   ``I'm glad the decision came out like it did ... even though it
won't bring my son back,'' Ms. Hawkins said.
   While supporters of Hawkins' family applauded, members of Fama's
family screamed in Italian and wept.
   ``Not my son! Not my son!'' shouted his mother, Josephine Fama.
   A cousin of Fama shouted, ``Joey! Joey!'' She went toward
Hawkins' family but was restrained by her relatives and court
officers.
   At his sentencing, Mondello declined an offer to address the
court.
   ``Without Mr. Mondello, there would not have been the death of
anyone. It was a senseless death,'' said the judge, of the
trial-level state Supreme Court.
   Hawkins and three friends had gone to Bensonhurst, a primarily
white neighborhood, to look at a used car; a mob of whites, having
been warned by Mondello's ex-girlfriend about ``outsiders,'' set
upon the black teen-agers.
   The judge said that if Mondello had felt threatened, ``All he
had to do was go home and call the police.''
   Instead, he said, the gang ``pursued Mr. Hawkins. If they had
stayed where they were, none of this would have happened.''
   Assistant District Paul Burns, arguing for the maximum term,
called the killing ``a Neanderthal type of behavior.''
   Defense attorney Stephen Murphy told the judge: ``I believe that
the law should rise above public opinion.''
   Later, Murphy said Mondello was ``very distraught'' over his
sentence. But, he added, ``Under the circumstances, with the public
outcry, I felt a sentence like that was going to be given.''
   With the Fama conviction, the city remained calm. But when
Mondello's verdict was delivered, acquitting him of the most
serious charges, crowds of blacks hurled rocks and bottles in
Brooklyn, and several reporters _ black and white _ were roughed up.
   Reacting to the sentences Monday, Bensonhurst residents stressed
that their neighborhood doesn't deserve the reputation the case has
brought it.
   A man who identified himself only as H. Bosque, 47, said the
white mob that attacked Hawkins ``got the wrong guy. But it doesn't
mean everybody's bad here. ... The media talked to the ignorant
people and put them on TV.''
   A delicatessen owner who wouldn't give his name said: ``We can't
wait for the whole thing to be over. We're not racist.''
   Mayor David Dinkins said: ``Now that the criminal justice system
has spoken, we all must join our hearts, heads and hands together
to rid our city of the racism that destroys lives and communities.
... We have had enough of tragedy. Together, we must and we will
move the healing process forward.''
   Opening statements are expected Monday in the trial of John
Vento, another of the white youths charged in the case. Owens set
trial dates in September, November and January for five other
defendants.
