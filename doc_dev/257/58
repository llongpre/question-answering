  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The fossil of a frog 
which lived about 150 million years ago was recently unearthed 
in Sinuiju, a northwestern city of Korea. 
  Last year the fossil of Korean archaeopteryx of the early 
Jurassic period of the Mesozonic era was discovered there, which 
shows the course of the evolution of birds from primitive 
reptiles, a higher land vertebrate. This convincingly proved 
Korea being a cradle of human civilisation where extinct animals 
and plants evolved systematically. 
  The discovery of the fossil frog in the same stratum is an 
irrefutable proof that a fast evolution of the frog was in 
progress in the Mesozonic era on the globe and the northwestern 
part of Korea was the central arena of that evolution. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song named the oldest 
known 
fossil frog discovered this time "archaeofrog." 
  The fossil unearthed and ascertained by authoritative 
natural 
scientists clearly preserves part of the vertebra, foreleg bone, 
hindleg bone, and the pelvis. 
  Fossil frogs in the world had so far been discovered in the 
stratum belonging to the period of and after the third Cenozoic 
era, or about 60 million years ago. The frog fossil recently 
unearthed in Korea belong to a time 90 million years earlier. 
  With the discovery of the fossil of archaeofrog which helps 
establish a new academic view on the evolution of the frog and 
its phylogeny and classification system, the long history of the 
land of Korea has become ever clearer.
