North American Indians always have held close spiritual ties with their 
ancestors. So when charges surface that human remains and religious artifacts 
from sacred Indian burial grounds have been unearthed by developers and tossed 
in a scrap heap, kin groups and tribal elders go on the warpath. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the remains of our people are sacred," says Vera Rocha, chairwoman 
of the Gabrieleno Indian Tribe, whose ancestors once occupied the hilly lands 
near Newport Beach. "Every time one of our burial sites gets destroyed, a piece 
of our religion also gets destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is fast becoming a treasure trove of fossils and cultural 
resources with historical significance. Indian villages and burial grounds are 
scattered throughout the county, and as residential and commercial construction 
continues many more are likely to be found. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. has spent roughly $6 million over the last three years on 
excavations within the 9,432-acre Newport Coast property between Corona del Mar 
and Laguna Beach. To date, the project has yielded natural rock shelters, 
grinding tools and spearheads, and the remains of a young Indian woman who 
lived 4,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
These treasures and others have allowed researchers and archeologists to study 
the Indians who once inhabited the area -- Gabrielenos and Juanenos. Human 
remains, in particular, help reveal a culture's diet, environment, evolution. 
</P>
<P>
But members of these two tribes say that development has not only threatened 
the sacred sites along the coast and elsewhere but has sent the spirits and 
souls of their ancestors into a sort of earthly void -- all in the name of 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Our religious beliefs deserve the same respect as anyone else's," Rocha says. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more than 12,000 American Indians living in Orange County are 
starting to assert their right to speak to the final destination of their 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a strong revival of Indian culture and an increasing awareness of 
their political and social identity, Indian leaders have organized protests and 
demanded that developers leave the bones of their ancestors undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people should not be removed with a scooper and a hopper," argues David 
Belardes, chief of the San Juan Capistrano-based Juaneno Indian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how best to protect the bones and burial sites already found, 
and those yet to be found, still remains at the center of a dispute among 
Indian groups and developers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, developers performed only cursory review of Indian burial grounds, 
says Michael Macko, former archeological director at the Newport Coast project. 
Macko surveyed the unincorporated area where the Irvine Co. now is building 
2,600 housing units. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until a few years ago, it was helter-skelter review," Macko says. 
</P>
<P>
These days, archeological and paleontological studies are routine. Under state 
law, American Insians' remains that are unearthed by developers either must be 
turned over to the most likely descendant or reburied within the project site. 
</P>
<P>
Of 92 archeological sites identified on the Newport Coast property, 67 will be 
preserved in open space -- Crystal Cove State Park and Irvine Coast Wilderness 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
So far, researchers have found evidence of two Indian groups. The first tribe 
arrived about 9,000 years ago but mysteriously vanished. The second tribe 
arrived about 1,500 years ago and used bows and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize they're not going to stop development because of a few arrowheads," 
says Belardes of the Juanenos. "But if we can't stop progress, at least allow 
us some dignity in how we bury our ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of sites offer little more than "shell debris and rock 
features," says Robert Selway, chief of cultural and historical programs for 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it's not as though developers and Indian leaders are fighting over mere 
fragments. Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, for example, the Juanenos asked the Mission Viejo Co. to allow 
tribal representatives on site during grading of an area near where the remains 
of 11 Indians were found in 1978. The company refused their request since state 
law already required it to have on site a certified archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and Indian groups still have yet to agree on the extent of the find 
at Hellman Ranch in Seal Beach. The Mola Development Co. conducted a subsurface 
investigation and found one finger digit. "The site was never classified as a 
burial, but some people are using this to try and stop development," says Kirk 
Evans, project manager for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly charred bones have surfaced at Pelican Hill in the Newport Coast project 
-- quite possibly the largest single archeological excavation in California. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers claim that these delays in construction schedules merely drive 
up their cost of doing business, thus raising prices of new homes. 
</P>
<P>
A few developers such as the Irvine Co., however, hire on-site Indian monitors 
or consultants when artifacts are likely to be found. Monitors ensure that 
sensitive burial sites are not disturbed and Indian relics are preserved. 
Occasionally, these monitors perform reburials. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements for Indian monitoring vary from county to county, and state 
guidelines are vague. Developers have complained about the fees charged by 
Indians, while the issue of who qualifies as a likely descendant has started 
tribal warfares among American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of developers don't use Native Americans as monitors because we've 
gotten a bad rap over the years for charging big bucks and then standing around 
doing nothing," Belardes says. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Valasques is a coastal Gabrieleno descendant and is employed as an Indian 
observer at the Newport Coast project. He also is on the Irvine Co. payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever human remains are discovered, I am consulted as to how I would like 
to dispose of them," he explains. "My job is to see that they are exhumed by 
hand with dignity and returned to the earth with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the remains from the Newport Coast project were placed in a wooden box 
about the size of a small suitcase and reburied. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not always sure what's going on with regard to reburials," says Rocha of 
the Gabrieleno Indian Tribe, who has long refused to recognize Valasques as a 
member of the tribe. "We're typically informed about these burials at the last 
minute when everything is either plowed under or bulldozed. Up until a month 
ago, we were involved in only one reburial." 
</P>
<P>
A powwow, of sorts, was held earlier this year between one developer, the 
Irvine Co., and the Gabrielenos and Juanenos. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. assured the two Indian tribes that they will have a new role in 
monitoring future archeological digs. 
</P>
<P>
"All the human remains and funeral-related items found on the Newport Coast 
site have been returned to Mother Earth," insists Bernard Maniscalco, project 
director for the Irvine Co. "All other artifacts will be donated to the Orange 
County Museum of Natural History and Science." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the company is eager to turn over the artifacts and to put to rest all 
Indian remains and descendants' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this is a racial issue because we're not digging up the bones of any 
other ethnic group," says Dr. Dudley Varner, executive director of the Orange 
County Museum of Natural History and Science. "But the Irvine Co. has done 
everything in its power to mitigate the issue of burial sites and 
funeral-related artifacts." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists typically excavate about 5% of artifacts before the bulldozers 
level the land. The Irvine Co. reviewed close to 20% of the Newport Coast area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a matter of sampling," says Roger Mason, current archeology director 
at Newport Coast. "Do you have a big enough sample? That decision has to be 
made on a site-by-site basis." (A final report on the human remains and 
religious artifacts found at Newport Coast will be released sometime next 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
Human remains probably can be found at every one of the roughly 1,200 recorded 
archeological sites in Orange County, says Belardes of the Juanenos and Macko. 
The problem is it's like finding a needle in a haystack. Meanwhile, battle 
cries from developers and Indian leaders continue to echo in Orange County 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't profess to have all the answers, but we're talking about our cultural 
heritage," adds Belardes. "If we don't do something now, we're not going to 
have a heritage."
