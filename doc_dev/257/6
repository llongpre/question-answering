APART from those who take the Book of Genesis literally, most people know
that humans descended from apes, and that our closest relatives among
animals are chimpanzees and gorillas. Until now the fascinating details of
enquiry into human evolution have been the province of specialists. But in
the last two decades debate has reached a crucial point: two main theories
have emerged about our origins, and the reason for the current spate of
books is that the experts are now submitting their arguments to the public.
The branch of science which investigates mankind's origins is
palaeoanthropology. It is based mainly on the study of fossilised skeletal
remains of early humans and their hominid ancestors, discovered by chance in
caves or ancient lake-beds. It is like trying to reconstruct a
thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle from a mere handful of remaining shapes. It is
an utterly fascinating branch of science. As each of these new books shows,
it is more like a gripping detective story than a scientific pursuit.
William Howells, until recently Professor at Harvard University, is the
doyen of contemporary palaeoanthropologists. His beautifully written survey
of the history of human origins is a worthy successor to Mankind in the
Making, the book that made him famous 30 years ago.
Lucidly succinct and magisterial, Howells' account takes us from the
beginnings of life on earth to the emergence of humans, setting the scene
for the more detailed discussion given by Christopher Stringer and Eric
Gamble in their superb study of the origins of modern man. They give a
brilliant introduction to the field: richly informative, marvellously
illustrated and always accessible to the layman. They not only investigate
the competing theories about our origins but explain how evidence for them
is gathered and assessed. This is excellent enjoyment and instruction in
one; anyone interested in the subject must own this book.
Eric Trinkaus and Pat Shipman, despite succumbing to the disagreeable
current fashion for chattily personalised writing which publishers believe
makes 'serious' subjects palatable to general readers, have produced a
valuable history of palaeoanthropology which dramatises the clash of
opinions now dividing it.
Like Stringer and Gamble, their interests lie chiefly with the more recent
end of the human evolutionary story, beginning 100,000 years ago with the
emergence in Europe and Western Asia of heavy-browed, massively-built
Neanderthal Man, named after the valley near Dusseldorf where, in 1856, the
first recognised skull was found. They recount the controversy that
immediately arose about whether Neanderthals are our ancestors or a mere
evolutionary side-branch. This question is at the heart of the current
controversy.
Most theorists agree that ape and man diverged about 5m years ago. The
earliest known hominids, the Australopithecines, date from 3.7m to 1.6m
years ago, represented in popular imagination by the diminutive hominid ape
called 'Lucy' The commonest and most enduring early man is Homo Erectus,
found across Africa, Europe, and Asia from 1.6m to 300,000 years ago. About
125,000 years ago our direct ancestors, archaic Homo Sapiens, appear at
African sites; then, mystifyingly a little later, Neanderthal Man appears,
only to vanish about 35,000 years ago. Was Neanderthal Man part of our own
direct lineage, or is he an aberration? All the authors under review attempt
to answer this question.
The first recognised Neanderthal remains were judged to belong to an idiot
with rickets. When accumulating evidence proved that Neanderthals were a new
kind of man, opinion divided; some took the ancestral, others the
aberrational view. Only one thing was clear: Neanderthals are distinctive,
differing from early modern humans in their powerful frames and heavy
skulls. They seem to have died out with the last ice age, rapidly succeeded
by a quite different type: taller, slimmer, smooth-browed Cro-Magnon Man.
And here one immediately sees the source of controversy. Ideas of race
sprang to the fore. Some earlier anthropologists refused to countenance the
possibility of human descent from Neanderthals, perceiving them as violent,
shambling brutes. Others interpreted early modern man in Aryan terms as
Neanderthals' conquerors. Either way, the savage appearance of Neanderthals
made them repugnant, even frightening. Studies at certain sites suggested
that Neanderthals might be cannibals. The brutish stereotype stuck, and
concepts of 'low' and 'high' human forms gave impetus to racism and eugenic
theories.
But evidence shows that Neanderthals buried their dead, perhaps on flowers
as the Shanidar fossils seem to testify, or with grave-gifts of meat,
perhaps for a journey into an afterlife. Some fossil individuals appear to
have lived into old age as cripples or invalids, impossible unless others
cared for them. This makes the brutish caricature implausible and has
encouraged some to think that Neanderthals genuinely belong to humanity's
lineage.
The needle-in-the-haystack nature of the enquiry has elicited both
brilliance and bizarrerie from researchers. Exquisite science has been
offset by folly or pettiness, the latter illustrated by those who, out of
jealousy, refused to let colleagues view their fossil finds. And there has
even been fraud, at its worst with Piltdown Man, the supposed apeman
'discovered' in Sussex in 1912.
The main conflict of theory is between the view that after the initial
spread of Homo Erectus from Africa about 1m years ago, different types of
humans evolved in the local areas where groups of Erectus settled. This is
known as the Regional Continuity hypothesis or, in Howells' apt phrase, the
'candelabrum' theory, because the evolutionary tree showing development from
Erectus to different modern human types looks like a many-branched
candelabrum.
The opposing theory is that true modern man developed from the Erectus stock
left in Africa. About 130,000 years ago, this theory has it, true Modern Man
began to spread out of Africa in a second exodus, everywhere replacing the
earlier descendants of Erectus in Europe and Asia. This is called the
Population Replacement hypothesis. It explains why Neanderthals and Modern
Man co-existed for a while, before the former vanished, seemingly displaced
by the latter; with the latter thereafter developing into all the types of
humans now found in the world.
Which hypothesis is right? The jury is out. These books help us to become
informed observers of its deliberations. Whichever way future evidence
pushes the decision, the debate will have given us an affection for our
ancestors and their relatives alike - including the Neanderthals - no matter
which branch of the family tree they sit upon.
