<HEAD>Human Jawbone 2 Million Years Old, Expert Says</HEAD>

   A human jawbone unearthed in central China has
been found to date back 2 million years, making it the oldest human
fossil discovered in China, an archaeologist said Saturday.
   The jawbone with several teeth was discovered in 1986 near the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan province, but dating
tests were completed only recently.
   The official People's Daily published the conclusion Saturday in
a front-page report and said it reinforced still inconclusive
arguments that man originated in Asia, not Africa.
   Ji Hongxiang, an archaelogist at the Academy of Social Sciences
and member of the team that excavated the site, said in a telephone
interview that experts believed the man to whom the jawbone belonged
was able to use fire and simple tools.
   The bone was found buried along with numerous bones of monkeys
and other mammals, Ji said.
   The oldest human remains previously found in China were teeth
found in Yuanmu County in southern China's Yunnan province in 1965.
They were determined to be 1.7 million years old.
   Archaeologists found more teeth last year in Yuanmu on Butterfly
Ridge and announced they were 2.5 million to 4 million years old and
were human. However, other Chinese experts said the teeth came from
an ape.
   China's most famous human fossils are the Peking Man bones,
discovered near Beijing in 1929 and lost during World War II. In the
1930s, the bones were dated as 500,000 years old, but some experts
believe the more advanced tests used now might prove them
considerably older.
   Fossil finds in eastern Africa indicate that the earliest kind of
primitive humans lived there about 2.5 million years ago.
