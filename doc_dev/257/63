   Scientists said today they have made a
breakthrough that will let them accurately estimate the ages of
fossils up to 30,000 years old, compared with the old limit of
about 9,000 years.
   The gain in the technique known as radiocarbon dating has
already paid off by corroborating a theory on how variations in
Earth's orbit affected ancient glaciers, and it could help research
into climate and other topics, scientists said.
   The new work can correct the technique's tendency to
underestimate ages by up to 3,500 years, researchers from Columbia
University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades,
N.Y., wrote in the British journal Nature.
   Scientists have long sought ways to make radiocarbon dating
accurate for older objects, and the new work seems to have
succeeded, said Harry Gove of the University of Rochester,
co-inventor of one radiocarbon dating technique.
   Another expert, Paul Damon of the University of Arizona, said,
``My guess is it will have a significant effect on the (estimated)
timing of past events'' in such areas as long-term variations in
climate.
   But Eric Delson, an anthropology professor at Lehman College of
the City University of New York, said he doubted the development
would make much difference in studies of human history. It would
simply adjust dates of many events in the same direction without
affecting the more important issue of the order in which they
occurred, he said.
   The 30,000-year time period covered by the study included the
spread of humans to the New World and cave painting in Europe, he
said.
   Radiocarbon dating is based on the fact that all living things
absorb a type of carbon called carbon-14. At death, the absorption
stops, and the amount trapped within the living thing begins to
decay at a constant rate.
   Scientists can date an object by comparing the amount of
carbon-14 in it today to the amount it had presumably absorbed from
the atmosphere while it was alive.
   The problem is that concentrations of carbon-14 in the
atmosphere vary unpredictably over time.
   Scientists have solved the problem for objects younger than
about 9,000 years, using calculations based on ancient tree rings
of known ages. But no reliable tree ring data is available for
objects older than that.
   In the new work, the researchers dated coral samples with both
carbon-14 dating and a second method, which depends on the constant
radioactive transformation of uranium-234 into thorium-230. The
second method, like the tree rings, provided an independent measure
for calibrating the carbon-14 data.
   The work was done by researchers Edouard Bard, Bruno Hamelin,
Richard Fairbanks and Alan Zindler.
   In a telephone interview, Zindler said the newfound accuracy
cleared up an inconsistency in a climate theory.
   Scientists had theorized that subtle changes in Earth's orbit
affected growth and melting of glaciers by changing the amount of
solar energy reaching the surface, he said. But previous carbon-14
dating of ancient coral clashed with that theory by suggesting the
last peak of glaciation was about 18,000 years ago, he said.
   The corrected date from the new study was 21,500 years ago,
which ``fits with that theory very well,'' Zindler said.
