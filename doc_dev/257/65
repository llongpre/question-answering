<TEXT>  A Over many generations, animal species can keep getting bigger as long as
their size works as an advantage -- or at least not as a disadvantage. And
many species are getting larger as time goes by -- including humans.;    With
a stable environment and sufficient food, such as the dinosaurs enjoyed,
animals can grow to huge sizes. "Dinosaurs were big because there was no
reason for them not to be. There was nothing to hold them back," said Michael
Greenwald, senior museum scientist at the University of California, Berkeley
Museum of Paleontology.;    The heaviest land animal known was a plant-eating
dinosaur called ultrasaurus, which weighed 140 tons and stood more than 20
feet tall at the shoulder. The longest land animal was seismosaurus, with an
estimated length of 130 to 150 feet.;    The heaviest animal ever to live is
the blue whale, which can weigh as much as 220 tons and reach up to 100 feet
in length.;    Many factors limit the size of vertebrate animals, but two
critical ones are bone strength and body heat.;    Regardless of what animal
it comes from, bone can carry only so much weight, said anatomy professor Dr.
Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago. Big animals get around this
limit by increasing the width of their bones in proportion to the length. But
this can go only so far. "Eventually you'll end up with a limb that's a big,
flat disc and not useful for walking on," LaBarbera said.;    The huge animals
that have existed so far on Earth probably haven't reached the proportional
limit, he added. But even if animals could evolve stronger bones, body heat
might stop their growth.;    Animals with large bodies generate more heat and
have a harder time getting rid of it than do small animals. The heat trapped
deep inside an elephant, for example, simply can't escape as fast as the heat
produced inside the shallower bulk of a cat.;    Big animals evolved
mechanisms to deal with this problem of thermoregulation. Elephants, weighing
up to 12,000 pounds, have extensive networks of blood vessels in their ear
flaps, and wave them to cool the blood as it pumps through, "like radiators,"
Greenwald said.;    Similarly, some dinosaurs developed veined plates or
spikes. But the most gargantuan of them all, the blue whale, found another
strategy. It lives in cold ocean waters, and water is a much better conductor
of heat than air.;    As for humans, 3-million-year-old fossils of
Australopithecus, the earliest known hominids, show generally that females
stood 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall and males 5 feet tall or more, said Dr. Bill Kimbel
of the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley. This height persisted until the
advent about 1.75 million years ago of a much larger human species, Homo
erectus, "which seems to be fully modern in its body size and proportions,"
and reached 6 feet tall, Kimbel said.;    Our modern species, Homo sapiens,
remains about the same size. We've seen size variations in recent history,
Kimbel noted, but those are not the results of evolutionary change, because
they do not appear to be genetic. Instead, they're related to changes in our
nutrition.;    Q Is there any harm in drinking rainwater?;    -- Alfonso
Jaramillo, San Jose; A There's probably no harm if you catch the rain in a
clean container as it falls from the sky and if you use it promptly. The
dangers arise when you drink rainwater that has run off your roof or has been
stored.;    Rain is pretty clean when it reaches the ground in the Bay Area.
The winds ahead of most storms mix and dilute the chemical pollutants in the
air -- mostly gases and fine particulates from auto emissions -- so falling
rain collects little harmful material, said Jim Sandberg, chief meteorologist
for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.;    But the rain's
cleanliness is short-lived. As water falls on rooftops and flows through
gutters and downspouts, it collects contaminants from leaves, dirt and animal
wastes.;    Droppings and urine from birds, rats and squirrels contain
bacteria and viruses that cause cramps, vomiting and diarrhea in humans, said
Tim Mulligan, supervising biologist for the Santa Clara County Health
Department. Serious infections can damage human lungs, bladders and livers.;  
 Even if you catch the rainwater cleanly, storing drinking water is risky.;   
Stored water attracts "flies, spiders, mosquitoes, mice -- you'd be amazed
what gets in," said Brian Zamora, San Mateo County director of environmental
health.  </TEXT>
