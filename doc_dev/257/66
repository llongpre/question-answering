   A Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton discovered by
a pair of amateur fossil hunters is yielding new insights on the
fearsome carnivore because it includes the only complete arm yet
found.
   Paleontologists unearthing the fossilized skeleton in the
badlands of eastern Montana say it appears to be the most complete
yet found of the biggest species of predatory dinosaur.
   ``We're pretty excited,'' said Patrick Leiggi, one of those at
the site. ```T rex' may be a household name among dinosaurs, but no
one's ever found a complete one, and that's what we've done.''
   The skeleton was spotted a year ago by Tom and Kathy Wankel of
Angela, Mont., on a fossil-hunting trip. They picked up some bones
they found protruding from the ground and turned them over to
experts at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman.
   ``We decided that what we had didn't mean much to us and might
be important to someone else,'' Mrs. Wankel said Tuesday. ``At the
museum they were very excited. They knew immediately that it was
part of the shoulder blade and arm of a large carnivore.''
   The pieces brought to the museum by the Wankels proved to be the
most complete arm of a T-rex ever discovered, according to Jack
Horner, head of the museum's paleontology effort. It will help
researchers learn how the short but strong arms of the dinosaur
were used.
   The crew from the museum began digging up the fossils last
month. They're keeping the exact location of the find secret to
deter looting; generally, it's in the Hell's Creek area north of
Jordan, a rich area for dinosaur hunters.
   Working in a pit 20 feet long and up to 10 feet wide, workers
uncovered 24 connected vertebrae in a serpentine pattern, preserved
in spot where the dinosaur died 65 million years ago.
   T-rex skeletons are rare _ only nine nearly complete skeletons
have ever been discovered and all but two came from Montana. Only
three complete skulls have been found.
   Although an adult T-rex could be to 35 feet long, 18 feet high
and weigh as much as an elephant at nearly 6.5 tons, the arms were
no longer than an adult man. Researchers had theorized that the
arms were either used only for mating, or perhaps were slowly
evolving away.
   Matt Smith of the museum's paleontology crew said that studying
the bones found by the Wankels show that the arm was very stout _
and very strong.
   Until now, all the T-rex skeletons found in Montana have been
shipped to museums out of state, but this one will stay at the
Museum of the Rockies.
