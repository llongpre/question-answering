BORN YESTERDAY (PG) Loius Mandoki
Sylvester Stallone hanging from a precipice is a sight we have all longed to
see: possibly followed by a swift, dramatic demonstration of the laws of
gravity. What we would want to learn is this. Does the iconographic baggage
accumulated in a career playing serial Neanderthal folk-heroes - Rockys 1-5,
Rambos 1-3 - add significant weight to the plummeting victim?
Unfortunately Cliffhanger, having no interest in cultural science, allows
Sly to survive. And survive and survive: through an avalanche of plot
contrivances and lucky breaks as our rescue climber hero plays guerrilla
hide-and-seek with the villains who have aircrashed on a snowy Colorado
mountain with Dollars 3m in stolen Treasury loot. (How many monkeys working
at how many typewriters thought up that story premise?)
Stallone's girl (Janine Turner) helps him slosh through the deep-pile snow,
as well as ankle through caverns measureless to man and dangle from
Indiana-Jones-surplus rope bridges. And Stallone's longtime rival (Michael
Rooker), held hostage by the baddies, may use the occasion to get even with
the man who - we saw it in scene one before the 'X Years Later' caption -
once let Rooker's girl slip to her doom over a dodgy chasm.
The last time I met these characters was when they fell out of a cornflakes
packet. I was aged nine and I remember picking up the Intrepid Mountain
Guide (green plastic), his Friend (blue plastic), his Girl (yellow) and the
Wicked Fugitive From Justice (red). I then plotted their showdown on the
breakfast table. Tea pot equalled Mont Blanc; spilled sugar equalled
avalanche; sticky marmalade represented quagmire.
My plot was better than Stallone's, who co-scripted this twaddle with
Michael France. And my direction was more authoritative than Renny 'Die Hard
2' Harlin's, who flings action set-pieces at us with all the desperation of
a man trying to walk a semi-conscious overdose victim (us the audience)
around a room to keep him alive.
But the swelling snowdrift of questions keeps stalling emotional momentum.
Why do all the characters keep bumping into each other on this giant
mountain-top as if it was Time Square? Why does climber Stallone choose this
eminently resistible crisis to take himself out of semi-retirement? And why
does the villain (John Lithgow) speak with an unexplained English accent?
Perhaps Alan Rickman and Anthony Hopkins each turned the role down. The
British baddie has become a fixture in modern Hollywood and one sees why.
Maximum contrast being desired between hero and villain, the more gruntingly
primitive is the first, the more louchely cultivated must be the second.
While Sly and Arnie take the good guy ever further in the direction of
thicko-monosyllabic, suave Brits distil perfidy in the perfect epigram. The
world is set for a final Armageddon between action-man America and creepy,
cerebral old Europe.
Years ago Sylvester Stallone and director John Landis made a gangster comedy
called Oscar. It fizzled out at the box-office, causing commentators to
write the career obituaries of both men. But Hollywood celebrities never
die, they merely return in different shape. While Stallone comes back as a
mountain-climber, Landis is busy plumbing infernal depths in vampire-ridden
Pennsylvania.
Innocent Blood is a piquant idea for a Gothic comedy. Sexy French
bloodsucker Anne Parillaud bites Mafia capo Robert Loggia and soon the whole
of Pittsburgh's Italian quarter has turned into an exchange-and-mart for
bodily fluids. Add a romantic policeman (Anthony LaPaglia), an almost witty
script ('I was starved' voice-overs Parillaud; 'I thought, what about
Italian?') and Landis's best Gothic special effects since An American
Werewolf In London and it should go with a sanguinary swing.
Unfortunately it becomes lost in Michael Wolk's script as a stranger would
in a city with a power-cut. Peering through the benighted visuals, we seek
passers-by to ask direction. But all we get is Mlle Parillaud's thick French
accent, smothering the funny lines with glottal gaucherie; and cross-talk
scenes that begin with bright mimetic certainty before descending into
witless murk. The ghost of the once-gifted Landis waves to us with a few
good visual jokes - Christopher Lee's Dracula cross-cut with Dan Quayle on
late-night TV - but even he goes down finally in the engulfing night.
Jeanne Moreau in The Old Lady Who Walked In The Sea is a sight to behold.
Sporting dresses and hats that would cause blushes in a Fellini film, she
struts and flounces as a con-person concocting crimes in Guadaloupe and
points north. The face, with its downturned moue of a mouth and deepening
ravines, is a national monument turning into a national disaster area. And
the voice is a low contralto snarl, modulating from velvety caress (for Luc
Thuillier as the young scam artist she sets out to seduce) to broken-glass
bitchiness (for fellow Michel Serrault).
If Bette Davis had never existed, Jeanne Moreau would make up for the
deficiency. She is just about all we remember in this French caper about two
old scoundrels limbering up for a jewel heist, while a third young scoundrel
(Thuillier) must outwit them or be outwitted. Director Laurent Heynemann,
co-scripting with Dominque Roulet from a novel by San Antonio, seems
time-warped in some sub-Losey belle epoque: when chic sets and darling
locations were the corrupt icing on man's humanity to man, and great stars
were wheeled on to be beastly to each other.
The beastliness here is fair-to-good. So is the kinky eroticism. 'She's not
an ice cream, she's a Stradivarius]' cries Serrault - formerly chief
wrist-flapper in La Cage Aux Folles - before he takes over cunnilingual
duties on the blonde girl Thuillier is servicing on the living-room sofa.
But we have seen this epatant-le-bourgeois sexiness in French cinema before.
(Look under 'Blier, Bertrand.') It melts away by movie's end, leaving as
terra firma only the histrionic island of Docteur Moreau: a place where
strange experiments are made on the human form and voice, and where majestic
sounds can be heard of primal rage and spite and grandeur.
In the June release of South Central and Born Yesterday we recognise the
unmistakable silly season distribution policy: 'It's Wimbledon fortnight so
let us unload our rubbish on cinemas that will be three-quarters empty
anyway.' South Central resembles an escaped TV movie: 99 minutes of peaktime
moral improvement as an ex-gangland black (Glen Plummer) tries to hold his
head - and his young son's - above the flood of battle and bigotry in modern
Los Angeles. Steven Anderson wrote and directed this 'Clones N The Hood';
Oliver (JFK) Stone executive-produced; and each new scene brings a new
pietistic cliche.
In Born Yesterday, Disney raids the graves of star Judy Holliday, writer
Garson Kanin and director George Cukor to produce a danse macabre of the
none-too-grateful dead. Surely the old 1950 comedy, about a tough guy who
entrusted his dimwit moll to the educating talents of a journalist, was
funny? Here Melanie Griffith plays the high-fluting bimbo as if taking first
comedy lessons from a deceased Miss Holliday. And co-stars Don Johnson and
John Goodman seek similar necromantic inspiration from the late William
Holden and Broderick Crawford. As remakes go, this one fails to. Everything
is obsequiously carbon-copied; nothing lives.
