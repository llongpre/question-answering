   Niels Nielsen has rappelled down the Old
Man of the Mountain for 30 years to protect the crumbling granite
silhouette from the ravages of nature and man.
   But last week, on his 63rd birthday, Nielsen slipped and fell.
He wasn't hurt, but decided to make it his last trip to the
40-foot-tall human profile carved by nature in New Hampshire's
White Mountains.
   Since 1960, Nielsen has tried to maintain the face by doing such
things as scraping algae, binding splits and diverting water. Next
year, the youngest of Nielsen's four sons takes over.
   ``My father kept asking me to come and it became one of the few
things he and I had in common,'' said David Nielsen, 32.
   Nielsen began caring for the Old Man while working for the state
Highway Department. Since then, he's made sure the face didn't go a
year without maintenance.
   ``You might say I pushed for it,'' he said. ``I didn't want to
see it come down.''
   The state paid for equipment and rented a helicopter to land
Nielsen above the Old Man so he could rappel down. Nielsen retired
from the department two years ago, when he began to work for free
with help from state parks workers.
   ``I'm not a mountain climber. I'm a mountain hanger,'' said
Nielsen, who lives in Plymouth, 30 miles south of Franconia.
   The first recorded sighting of the Old Man was in 1805, by
construction workers who thought it resembled Thomas Jefferson. The
orator Daniel Webster said of it, ``God Almighty has hung out a
sign that in New Hampshire He makes men.''
   The author Nathaniel Hawthorne visited the Old Man in 1832 and
wrote: ``It seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had
sculptured his own likeness on the precipice. ... The vast lips ...
if they could have spoken, would have rolled their thunder accents
from one end of the valley to the other.''
   Today, the Old Man is broken and humbled by time.
   The shifting of the earth on Cannon Mountain is splitting its
Neanderthal forehead and weakening its Adam's apple. Acid rain has
burned its face so badly that the granite crumbles in Nielsen's
hands.
   Last week, Nielsen killed algae on the Old Man's face with
bleach to prepare it for an application of acid retardant.
   He is not the first to care for the Old Man.
   In 1906, a Methodist minister, the Rev. Guy Roberts, was
climbing over the face and discovered its forehead was sliding.
Roberts spent nine years looking for someone to help repair the
profile.
   In 1915, he met Ed Geddes, a quarry superintendent from Quincy,
Mass., who a year later climbed the cliffs and bolstered the
forehead with steel buckles. But a short time later, the forehead
began splitting.
   In 1937, Geddes, then 74, and other volunteers carried concrete
a mile up the cliffs in backpacks to fill the gap. In 1958, state
workers strengthened Geddes' buckles.
   David Nielsen's wife, Deborah, climbed to the Old Man on one of
their first dates. Now she is the Old Man archivist, recording
measurements of the Old Man and the names of its helpers for a
yearly report.
   Nielsen hopes his 11-year-old grandson, Tommy, will continue the
tradition, though the boy has not yet scaled the face.
