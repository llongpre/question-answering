Most archeologists are content to dig up pottery, bones and other relics of the 
past. Thomas H. Loy takes a different approach -- he analyzes ancient blood. 
</P>
<P>
Loy, of the Australian National University in Canberra, has developed a 
technique for literally lifting minute splotches of blood off stone tools and 
bones. Not only does the blood possess features that identify what species of 
animal it came from, but it can be used to date artifacts up to 50,000 years 
old. Researchers may even be able to extract bits of genetic material from 
prehistoric blood that will provide insights into human evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Loy introduced his technique of blood residue analysis to the scientific world 
in 1983. In his laboratory, he studied 104 stone tools unearthed in British 
Columbia that range in age from 600 to 1,000 years and found blood deposits on 
nearly all of them. The blood belonged to a variety of animals, he reported, 
including blacktailed deer, moose, snowshoe rabbits, caribou and grizzly bears. 
A few of the younger artifacts contained human blood. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has taken blood residue analysis out of the lab and into the 
field. At a 10,000-year-old farming village in Turkey, Loy and Andree R. Wood 
of the University of Chicago recently extracted the blood of humans, sheep and 
an extinct type of cattle from a stone slab near the entrance of a structure 
ominously known as the "skull building." 
</P>
<P>
Rooms in the rear of the skull building in the Turkish village of Cayonu Tepesi 
contained more than 90 human skulls and the remains of several human skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know exactly what was going on in the skull building, but human and 
animal blood was abundant on the slab," Wood said. The occasional cutting up of 
humans and animals, for whatever reasons, may have taken place there, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The grisly practice of human sacrifice is one possibility, but bodies may have 
been carted to the skull building after death and placed on the slab for some 
type of ritual before burial. The skeletal remains in the back of the building 
may have come from individuals placed on the slab, although there are no 
decapitation marks at the base of the skulls. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever purpose the skull building served, Loy's blood analysis demonstrates 
that people living in one of the world's earliest known farming villages had 
surprisingly complex cultural practices. This suggests that the village had 
existed for some time prior to 10,000 years ago, which in turn strengthens the 
notion that humans crossed the threshold from hunting and gathering to a 
farming life considerably earlier than many had believed. 
</P>
<P>
The process of studying ancient blood begins by locating dark patches of 
suspected blood with a low-power microscope. The samples are analyzed with a 
coated paper strip sensitive to hemoglobin in the blood. Confirmed blood 
deposits are scraped off and subjected to a chemical process that crystallizes 
hemoglobin. The size and shape of hemoglobin crystals differ among animal 
species, allowing researchers to identify what type of beast spilled the blood. 
To further check the results, hemoglobin is placed in a gel and exposed to an 
electric field; its molecules then line up in patterns that correspond to 
specific animal species. 
</P>
<P>
If the blood appears to be from a human being, it is tested for the presence of 
human immunoglobulin, which aids in the body's defense against disease. 
</P>
<P>
At Cayonu Tepesi, Loy and Wood isolated human and sheep blood on the stone 
slab, but were puzzled by the presence of another type of blood from an 
unknown, nonhuman species. They lifted blood from bone fragments of an extinct 
cattle species discovered at the site and found that its hemoglobin crystals 
matched those of the unknown species taken from the slab. This is the first 
time the blood of an extinct animal has been identified, Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
Further excavations in the skull building uncovered several skulls and horns 
belonging to the same extinct form of cattle. Loy and Wood also found a large 
flint knife containing traces of cattle and human blood. The knife may have 
been used in human sacrifices or mortuary rituals, but Loy noted that human 
blood often ends up on stone tools when toolmakers accidentally cut their 
fingers while adjusting an edge. 
</P>
<P>
Minute quantities of blood taken from the skull building's slab were also 
placed in a machine that separates and counts carbon atoms of different mass. 
The decay of specific carbon atoms in the samples allowed Loy and Wood to 
calculate that the blood is about 9,000 years old. Carbon dating is typically 
used with charcoal and is considered accurate back to about 50,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, Loy found that blood can survive on stone for much longer 
than 9,000 years, or even 50,000 years. A stone tool from a site in Iraq that 
dates to between 75,000 and 125,000 years ago yielded human blood that Loy 
originally thought came from a Neanderthal. 
</P>
<P>
However, further analysis indicated that the hemoglobin crystals in the 
prehistoric blood were comparable to those of modern humans, Loy said. He 
acknowledged that it is unclear now which species left behind the blood on the 
stone tool. 
</P>
<P>
Neanderthals and modern humans inhabited the Near East at around the same time, 
but the bulkier Neanderthals became extinct around 35,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many anthropologists contend that modern humans -- who are considered modern 
because of shared changes in the anatomy of the skull and lower body -- 
originated in Africa and rapidly spread throughout the world around 200,000 
years ago, driving Neanderthals to extinction in the process. Others argue that 
modern humans originated nearly 1 million years ago in several regions of the 
world and interbred to some extent with Neanderthals. 
</P>
<P>
One way to help resolve the debate is to study the genetic material, or DNA, of 
Neanderthals and modern humans for evidence of chemical similarities or 
differences, Loy said. He and his colleagues plan to extract and analyze DNA 
from the ancient Iraqi blood using the techniques of modern DNA fingerprinting, 
which rely on enzymes that chop up DNA into distinct patterns. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a method developed by British researchers to extract DNA from bone 
could enable scientists to compare the chemical makeup of DNA from Neanderthal 
and modern human fossils. Similarities would point to a shared genetic heritage 
between Neanderthals and ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
If such studies are conducted, confirmed samples of Neanderthal DNA can be 
compared to DNA taken from the Iraqi blood sample, Loy noted. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond disputes over human evolution, blood residue analysis also has the 
potential to clarify the history of specific diseases, according to Loy. The 
human body contains a library of antibodies formed to fend off particular 
illnesses. Those antibodies can be isolated from ancient blood samples and 
researchers can determine the ailments afflicting people who died thousands, or 
tens of thousands, of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yet archeologists are not clamoring to conduct independent blood analyses and 
DNA studies on prehistoric stones and bones, Loy lamented, because they simply 
are not trained in the new techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the blood of Neanderthals and even earlier members of the human 
evolutionary family undoubtedly stains some of the millions of stone tools 
lying in the museums of the world. "There's a tremendous blood bank on ancient 
stone tools just waiting to be studied," Loy said.
