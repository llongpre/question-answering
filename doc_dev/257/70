   Police were worried that a package left on
the steps of the University of Utah's Museum of Natural History
might contain a bomb. But an X-ray revealed the bones of a
1,000-year-old mummy.
   Authorities say the remains, packed into a Sears television box,
likely belong to member of the ancient Anasazi Indian tribe.
Anthropologists and pathologists say the rare find is among the
best preserved they have seen.
   Law enforcement officials believe looters carried the mummy from
its burial cave in the desert Southwest, where the Anasazi, or
``Ancient Ones,'' farmed and hunted from about 600 A.D. until 1350
A.D.
   Anthropologists say they are the ancestors of the Hopi and
Pueblo Indians of today.
   Second thoughts and stiff penalties for pilfering Indian
artifacts on federal or Indian lands probably led the anonymous
finders to ``donate'' the remains to the museum, University of Utah
Police Chief Wayne Shepherd said.
   Museum officials said they intended to give up the remains for
reburial. Authorities have contacted state and federal Indian
agencies, but no decision has been made on where or how the remains
will be reburied.
   Indian tribes strongly oppose allowing such remains to be
displayed in museums, believing it to be sacrilege. Pressure from
Indian groups recently prompted the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington to agree to return its Indian remains to tribes for
reburial.
   Shepherd said a University of Utah museum secretary received an
anonymous telephone call Oct. 11 from a woman who said her husband
had found a mummy, knew having it was illegal and wondered whether
the museum wanted it. The caller told the employee to look on the
back steps and hung up, Shepherd said.
   Police were called and, as a cautionary measure, took X-rays of
the box to ensure that it didn't contain a bomb. Instead, the
X-rays showed vague outlines of a human skeleton.
   Utah State Medical Examiner Dr. Todd Grey said he found the
mummy in ``remarkable'' shape, given its apparent age.
   ``It's a very rare find,'' added University of Utah
anthropologist John McCullough. ``We have very few specimens of
that time period available.''
   The professor said much valuable data was lost, however, because
the burial site is unknown.
   ``It's unfortunate from two aspects. Foremost is that a burial
was disturbed in a most unceremonious way. It's desecration,'' he
said. ``Second is that from an archaeological standpoint, whatever
information we could have gleaned has been largely lost.''
   Thousands of ancient Indian dwellings scattered throughout the
southwestern United States attract artifact hunters. Looting and
damage to potentially significant archaeological sites has led to
laws prohibiting scavenging on federal lands.
   The mummy was folded into a fetal position and covered with a
woven robe. Feathers or tufts of rabbit fur covered the lower
extremities. The skull, apparently severed during excavation, was
nestled in polystryrene packing material between the feet.
   The torso and legs were covered with a brown, parchment-like
skin. Fingernails and toenails were still evident.
   ``We don't see mummified remains that often,'' Grey said. ``I
see homicide victims who have been dead for two or three years and
they're bones.
   ``This is a really nice example of what can happen to human
remains in a dry, warm and protected environment,'' he added.
   That state of preservation has allowed Grey and McCullough to
draw a few conclusions about the mummy, which is believed to be
that of a woman in her 60s.
   While the exact age of the remains isn't known, McCullough
estimates it falls somewhere between 800 A.D. and 1200 A.D.
   The flattened back of the head suggests the remains are American
Indian, since Indians often strapped their infants to flat cradle
boards. The size and shape of the skull, and small size of the
skeleton, indicate the mummy is probably female, while compressed
vertebrae offer clues to her age.
