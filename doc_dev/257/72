   The largest carnivore ever to roam the
Earth is emerging from the badlands of eastern Montana _ after
being buried for 65 million years.
   A museum crew's careful digging has uncovered most of an intact
skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex, only the eighth ever found. The
remains exposed so far include the skull, tail, pelvis area, arm
and back.
   The lower arm bones are the first ever found for any T-rex.
   The Tyrannosaurus is perhaps the most fabled of all dinosaurs
because of its size _ nearly 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet
high _ and its meat-eating diet.
   ``If you like ferocity ... ferocious things, the T-rex has got
to be at the top of the list,'' said Jack Horner of the Museum of
the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont. ``It has a whole mouth full of steak
knives, which it almost exclusively used to eat meat.''
   Tyrannosaurus rex teeth were up to 6 inches long. The skull
being unearthed is 4 feet long, with eye sockets 4 to 5 inches in
diameter. The socket hole in the pelvis where the leg attached is
10 inches across.
   Horner, head of paleontology at the museum, said the scientific
value of the T-rex skeleton is limited, but it will be a big
drawing card for the museum.
   ``It's a real showy thing,'' he said Monday. ``Then we'll show
them things they might not have driven so far to see, but I think
are better.''
   Horner is known internationally for his discoveries of dinosaur
fossils in the northern Plains and the Rocky Mountain foothills, as
well as his theories on dinosaur behavior.
   His work has shown that dinosaurs tended to care for their
young, more like birds than modern-day reptiles. Among the museum
displays is a dinosaur nest, with fossilized baby dinosaurs just
emerging from their fossilized eggs.
   Horner said the Tyrannosaurus rex will be studied and a
scientific description written.
   Nicholas Hotton, a curator of paleontology at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C., said any new knowledge about the
giant carnivore would help.
   Tyrannosaurus rex was discovered early this century.
   ``It was described in a paper three pages long and that's all
there is. Nobody has ever described it in detail,'' Hotton said.
   The newly discovered skeleton still has all the vertebrae from
the back and tail fused together. The skull broke off at the neck,
but is only several feet away from the neck and back. Leg bones
have been found near the skull and more are thought to be buried
beneath the other bones.
   It will take a dozen people several more weeks to finish the
painstaking task of exposing the bones, which will then be put in
plaster casts and loaded on trucks to be hauled to the museum.
