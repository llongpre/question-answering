His short life was troubled by breathing difficulties. And after his death many 
years ago, someone strung, wired, spring-loaded and sold his bones. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on the eve of Halloween, 1989, an old rattled skeleton nicknamed Charlie 
hangs alone, covered by plastic, in the garage of an Anaheim radiologist who 
wants to sell him. 
</P>
<P>
"Articulated Human Skeleton complete with stand, $1,600," reads the classified 
advertisement in this month's issue of the Bulletin of the Orange County 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
There, listed under "Miscellaneous" and next to ads for a sailboat, an 
"Oriental collection" and seminar space, is the doctor's offer. "Human skull, 
with color-cut sections, case included, $600," it continues. "Excellent 
condition. Make offer for both." 
</P>
<P>
Halloween enthusiasts, the doctor says, need not apply. For the tale of this 
skeleton is scientific, not scary. At least 364 days a year, skeletons are 
serious business. 
</P>
<P>
Like many doctors who have skeletons in their closets for study or teaching, 
Dr. Vahe Meghrouni bought the one he named Charlie from a medical supply 
company. That was more than 25 years ago, when human remains were relatively 
plentiful and cheap. He paid about $250 for the anonymous skeleton, identified 
only by a stamp of the New York supply company, "Clay Adams Inc." inside the 
hip bone. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Charlie served his purpose well, showing doctors, patients and 
technicians how X-rays relate to the skeleton, Meghrouni said. When he could, 
he tried to protect the skeleton's former human dignity from student pranksters 
or aggressive instructors armed with felt pens. Meghrouni taped a typewritten 
sign to its skull: "Keep pens and pencils out of my eyes and nose." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the doctor brought the skeleton home to his luxury estate in the 
Anaheim hills. The bones didn't bother his wife, Armine, a former 
anesthesiologist, nor did they interest his dog Peaches. But his children 
thought they were mildly creepy, and the skeleton moved from the study to 
various bedrooms, then finally to the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little reluctant to part with him," said Meghrouni, 63. But now that he 
is retiring, the doctor has no more use for the skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Meghrouni insists he will sell Charlie only to someone with an 
academic interest, and not as a curio or for "sport." 
</P>
<P>
"It should be treated with respect," he said, casting a fond glance toward the 
eye sockets. "That was a person." 
</P>
<P>
All he can tell from the bones is that they belonged to a 5-foot, 3-inch adult 
man with a deviated septum -- hence the breathing troubles -- and buck teeth. 
Meghrouni surmised he was from India because, until recently, that country was 
the world's largest supplier of skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
At one time India was exporting 10,000 to 15,000 full skeletons and an 
additional 50,000 skulls a year. They came mostly from Calcutta, where 13 
companies bought unclaimed bodies from morgues, hospitals and the police and 
sold them to foreign markets. But in 1985, the country banned the export of 
human remains, partly for religious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hindu religion, the souls of bodies that are not cremated "will hover 
and not be at peace," said Pravin Jani, commercial assistant at the Indian 
Consulate in San Francisco. Religious volunteers scour the same places as the 
body brokers, taking the unclaimed bodies to funeral pyres, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but the trade is "repulsive and distasteful," P.R. Chakravarty, 
a London spokesman for the Indian embassy, has said. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, where the sole market for human remains is among medical 
schools and students, "it's been impossible to get human skeletons," said Dr. 
Robert Blanks, course director for human gross anatomy at UC Irvine's 
California College of Medicine. When Americans donate their bodies for use as 
cadavers to medical schools, the remains are buried by the family when the 
students have finished, Blanks said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dearth of new skeletons for sale, he said, "There's not a big 
market here." The estimated 20,000 skeletons in circulation in the United 
States are still adequate, he said. "It's not unusual for physicians to have 
skeletons in their closet." 
</P>
<P>
The college already has 14 human skeletons, and furnishes 92 boxes of bones for 
every student. 
</P>
<P>
Former students who in years past were required to buy their own skeletons to 
study have called in saying, "I have a skeleton in my closet, would you mind 
buying it?" Blanks said. "We buy it back at what they think it's worth." 
</P>
<P>
A student-quality skull, bought for $100 in 1970, might fetch up to $500 today, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blanks said a $1,600 price tag on a full human skeleton is "very reasonable, 
actually." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, students now also use high quality plastic reproductions of human 
bones, even though plastic models, while sophisticated, cannot match the real 
thing for showing openings for vessels and nerves and internal structure of the 
bones, Blanks said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicts the demand for human bones will increase in the next two years due 
to attrition of the fixed supply. "Students drop boxes, lose bones, they mark 
them up with pens and you have to throw them away." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a few U.S. suppliers may find new sources for skeletons, he said, 
but warned they wouldn't want to talk about it. "They have legal import 
permits. But they are very cautious of their sources. They want to protect 
them."
