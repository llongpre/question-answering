<LEADPARA>  WHAT if the dinosaurs really didn't mysteriously die out but just continued
evolving until they turned into something else, such as ostriches or swans?;  
 Goofy as it may sound, that's a broad interpretation of a popular scientific
theory that says birds and reptiles have a common ancestor. The notion has
been around at least 200 years and still has wide currency.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The possible link between the dinosaurs of 140 million years ago and
today's birds is explored on PBS this week in a fascinating edition of the
"Nova" series called "The Case of the Flying Dinosaur." The show, second of
three "Nova" episodes about dinosaurs, plays Tuesday at 9 p.m. on Channel 9.; 
  The dinosaur/bird theories spring from scientific attempts to search out the
origin of birds by studying fossils from the Mesozoic Era.;    Scientists can
see links between existing birds and reptiles -- such as the presence of
scales and births from hard-shelled eggs -- but there are many differences,
too, between cold-blooded reptiles and warm-blooded birds.;    Yet
well-preserved fossils of bird-like reptiles first found in German limestone
quarries in the 18th century inspired some renowned scientists, including
Thomas Huxley, to believe they were evidence of an evolutionary turn taken by
dinosaurs.;    Most of the "flying dinosaur" partisans believe that
prehistoric reptiles that ran or leaped to grab prey gradually acquired the
ability to fly. Others think it's more likely the dinosaur ancestors of birds
were tree-climbing reptiles that developed wings to "sail" after prey.;    The
fossils that were central to the theory were those of creatures known as
archaeopteryx -- small, bird-like reptiles with wings. They promised to be the
"missing link" between dinosaurs and birds.;    Debate over the theory has
divided the scientific world for years, and the "Nova" episode explores both
sides of the controversy.;    "It's an enormously attractive idea," said bird
fossil expert Larry Martin about the dinosaur theory. "If I have a cage with a
parakeet in it, it's certainly a lot more fun to think that it's a small
tyrannosaurus." Martin is among those who believe birds originated
independently and probably existed side by side with dinosaurs. He thinks the
"flying dinosaur" theory is the result of inadequate study of the fossil
records.;    Latest challenge to the theory is the 1985 discovery of a new
bird-like fossil creature, tentatively dubbed "protoavis," which predates
archaeopteryx by millions of years, making it a contemporary of the dinosaurs
from which birds are supposed to have evolved. The first scientific papers
describing this creature are due this spring.;    Still, "Nova" stirs the
imagination with some carefully photographed scenes of contemporary birds that
do resemble dinosaurs when seen from the proper angle. Example: ostriches
browsing on a plain, looking like brontosauruses with feathers.;    This
edition of "Nova" replays the scene in "King Kong" where Kong beats up a
pterodactyl trying to make off with Fay Wray. But it warns against any leap to
the conclusion that pterodactyls were related to modern birds. The world of
science is unanimously of the opinion that birds didn't evolve from those
particular bat-winged reptiles. So when Steven Spielberg starts filming
Michael Crichton's novel "Jurassic Park," a fanciful story about dinosaurs
being cloned on an island off the coast of Central America, he probably should
omit the part about pterodactyls being kept in a giant aviary. (box)  </TEXT>
