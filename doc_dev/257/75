   Researchers say the Dead Sea
was a lively commercial center as far back as 2,300 years ago, not
anywhere near like it is today with few boats and only sparse
settlement along the shores.
   The research may also throw new light on the Essenes who lived
in the area, casting doubt on the accepted theory that they were
isolated hermits.
   Arieh Nissenbaum, a geo-chemist, said three stone anchors and
mooring ropes found recently in the Dead Sea were the ``first
datable evidence'' to support the theory that the Dead Sea was an
active place for commerce in the 4th century B.C.
   He said Carbon 14 testing at the Weizmann Institute of Science
in Rehovot on well-preserved fiber rope fragments left open the
possibilty that the anchors were from ships sunk in the first
Middle East oil war.
   ``The Dead Sea was not so dead. This is a misleading name given
to the lake by the British,'' said Gideon Hadas, an Antiquities
Authority archaeologist.
   According to ancient historians, a huge naval battle was fought
in 312 B.C. when Antigonus, the Seleucid ruler of Syria, tried to
seize control of the trade in asphalt, which naturally forms from
evaporating petroleum. He was repelled by the superior archery of
the Nabateans of southern Jordan who were backed by Egypt.
   Although there was uncertainty about the date because of a
100-year margin of error in dating, Nissenbaum said it is possible
that ``the anchors are mute witnesses to that battle.''
   Hadas found the 220-pound anchors along the western shore of the
lake, which at 1,292 feet below sea level is the lowest spot on
earth.
   He said the ropes were well preserved because of the high salt
content of the water and suggested other remains, even wooden
boats, might also be nestling in the seabed.
   Asphalt, which came to the surface in large blocks from fissures
in the seabed, was the prize of ancient traders. Nissenbaum said it
was used as mortar for buildings, an embalming agent in the
Egyptians mummification process, a medicine to treat skin wounds
and as a bug-killer.
   In a new study of Dead Sea shipping, Nissenbaum said that up to
the end of the Crusader era there was active boat traffic on the
lake. Ships ferried wheat and corn grown in southern Jordan along
the 50-mile length of the salt sea to the northern end where roads
led to Jericho and Jerusalem.
   A large Israelite farming community grew at Ein Gedi on the lake
shore and Hasmonean kings built a series of fortresses in the area.
   The Dead Sea region, surrounded by barren mountains and rocky
desert, fell into economic decline after the Crusader period. Today
the only boats on the lake are a few Israeli military patrol craft.
Just a few small settlements occupy its shores, and foreign
visitors come mostly to the health spas that promote the curative
powers, especially for those afflicted with skin diseases, of the
Dead Sea waters and mineral-rich mud.
   Robert Eisenman, chairman of the religious studies department at
California State University in Long Beach, suggests today's image
of the Dead Sea as a lifeless region may be the basis of a
misleading view of the Essenes, keepers of the Dead Sea scrolls.
   Traditional theories about the sect portrays them as a small
isolated community of hermits who sought refuge in a remote
wilderness, but he suggests this may not have been the case.
   His 15-member surveying and mapping expedition recently
completed a study of the Qumran caves at the northern end of the
Dead Sea. It was there that the scrolls dating to the second
century B.C. were discovered in 1947.
   Eisenman said his survey explored 282 desert caves along a
13-mile stretch of coast and found pottery as well as other
evidence of man living in 62 of them. He said a 1952 survey found
only 230 caves in the area and suggested man could live in only 17.
   Eisenman added that his findings indicated there could be more
scroll-bearing caves in the area and that many more had been
inhabitated that originally suggested.
   ``There was a lot of habitation,'' he said, pointing to pottery
shards in front of a large cave half-way up the side of a cliff of
brittle rock shale.
   ``This means it was not isolated like a lot of people think. The
idea of hermetic Essenes contemplating their navels in isolation is
rather peculiar.''
