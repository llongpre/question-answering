<LEADPARA>  I AM sulking because I want a shiny new semi-automatic pistol and not the .38
revolver I've been given. I don't like the revolver; my hand is too small for
this weapon of destruction.;    I have a gun in my hand for the first time in
my life because I've been told that before I write about the loaded topic of
guns and society, I ought to experience it first hand.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Guns and the people who use them. I'm not quite sure about the mental
health of the other people who are taking this course on weapons training in
San Jose. There is one couple with matching black satin jackets, matching
shiny semi-automatics, matching yellow headphones and matching plexiglass eye
protection. They also had matching smiles.;    Then there were two others who
fall into the Neanderthal category: hairy and with a certain coldness of the
eye that suggests one word to me -- psychopath. One of them is wearing
buckskin boots.;    They were armed -- one with a revolver, the other with a
semi-automatic.;    Don't worry about it, says Leroy Pyle, the San Jose cop
who originated this firearms training session and who is persona non grata
with his boss, police chief Joe McNamara, because of Pyle's vocal support for
the National Rifle Association. Pyle isn't allowed to teach the course at the
Santa Clara Valley Rifle Club range any longer -- he says it has to do with
departmental politics -- and now the daylong training is taught by Pyle's
friend and colleague Gerry Marcal. Pyle does show up around lunch-time to talk
with the class about the laws governing handguns.;    "Sometime over the
course of the morning, have you not looked around the people in this class and
wondered what that weirdo wants a gun for?" Pyle asks. We all look a little
sheepish and I can't help sneaking a glance at the Neanderthals. To my horror,
they are both staring directly at me as if I would be the danger to society.; 
  But hey, guys, chill out. I'm the normal one.;    Or am I? I couldn't wait
to get that pistol in my hand and aim it at the cardboard silhouette at the
end of the indoor range. I am tired of the endless lecture on safety. I can't
wait to smell cordite in the air. I long to hear the menacing click of the
slide as I chamber a round! C'mon, make my day!;    My attitude doesn't
exactly fit with the ethics of the course, which is one on defensive weapons
training -- how to deal with someone who breaks into your house intending to
harm you or your family. This isn't a course on how to be an outlaw. There was
to be no posturing, no macho displays of gun-waving or flourishing or
brandishing or menacing or any of the other things that look so much fun on
the movies.;    "You find someone in your back yard, you don't execute them,"
Pyle says. "You use your gun to protect yourself and ward them off.";    This
is another reason I am sulking. I hadn't taken the course to learn safety.
After all those years of firearm-repression, I long to brandish my weapon
around. If it hadn't been for the two San Jose police officers standing there,
I might have allowed myself a little fun. But no. Instead we learn about all
the things you aren't allowed to do.;    "In the privacy of your own home, you
can carry it concealed, unconcealed, loaded, unloaded, hang it on the wall or
paint it pink," says Pyle. "But once you step outside your home, No. 1, it
can't be loaded, and No. 2, when you go out that door you can't carry a
concealed weapon.";    Pyle's persuasiveness gives me a glimmer of
understanding about NRA logic. Even so, the group worries me. I'm sure there
are many responsible gun owners out there but there must also be many people
like me, caught up in the movies and our own imaginations. I couldn't trust
myself.;    The lectures are over. We are handed weapons.;    We all step
forward to the firing line.;    We load our weapons.;    "Is the line ready?"
shouts Marcal, who wisely, was standing way back.;    "The line's ready," he
shouts again and blows his whistle.;    Boom! Ba-boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!;   
Through the smoke I squint at the cardboard silhouette on my target, trying to
see if I've shot it through the heart.;    I suddenly remember who I am -- a
conventional, middle-class person with conventional accouterments and even
optimistic expectations. The veneer of civilization, I discover, is alarmingly
thin.  </TEXT>
