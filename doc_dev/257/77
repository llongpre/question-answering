   The timber industry urged the government
Monday to reject a spotted-owl protection strategy proposed by
government scientists, saying it would cost 102,000 jobs and turn
some towns into rural ghettos.
   Researchers commissioned by the American Forest Resource
Alliance said logging communities in Washington, Oregon and
Northern California accept the need to reduce timber harvests to
protect the environment.
   But they said the government should consider human as well as
environmental needs in developing a plan to protect the endangered
owl.
   ``Yeah, we're going to lose jobs,'' said John Beuter, a forest
economics consultant from Portland, Ore. He said the question is,
``How much of this is really necessary and how will it be
implemented over time?''
   The Forest Service has estimated that 28,000 timber jobs would
be lost by the end of the decade under owl-protection policies
recommended in an April report written by team of government
scientists headed by Jack Ward Thomas.
   Beuter said his research shows the figure would be twice that,
plus thousands more jobs lost outside the timber industry. The
direct and indirect job loss would come to 102,000 by the end of
the decade if the report's strategy is applied to public and
private lands, he said.
   A federal timber task force is scheduled to come up with an
extensive owl-protection plan by Sept. 1.
   Estimates of the remaining spotted owl population range from
3,000 to 5,000 pairs. Each nesting pair needs a large tract of
undisturbed old-growth forest, biologists say.
   Robert Lee, a natural resource sociologist at the University of
Washington, said a bitter class war already has developed between
urban environmentalists who want to save old-growth forests and
loggers who are ``portrayed as Neanderthals of the woods.''
   Lee, part of the timber industry's research team, predicted
rural communities would find it difficult to adapt to a changing
economy. ``People are so isolated,'' he said. ``They have
non-transferable skills. They have a sense of identity. ... They
may not be able to sell their homes. They're immobilized.''
   The stress on timber workers could lead to increased suicides,
drug abuse and family violence, Lee said.
   ``The real issue is how to humanize the transition to another
way of life,'' he said, adding that one way would be to let
Northwest communities participate in the decision-making process.
   Last month the Bush administration announced partial plans to
reduce timber harvests on land controlled by the Bureau of Land
Management. The estimated impact of those plans would be about
1,000 logging jobs lost over two years.
   The administration also formed the task force, which is working
on a plan for the millions of acres controlled by the Forest
Service.
   Environmentalists have indicated they will go to court if the
eventual plan is less than the Thomas report strategy.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service last month announced it will
classify the spotted owl as threatened and entitled to protection
under the Endangered Species Act. The act requires federal agencies
to secure permission from the service before harming a species or
its habitat.
   The study team for the American Forest Resource Alliance reports
included private consultants as well as economists, social
scientists and foresters from the universities of Washington,
California, Montana and Minnesota.
