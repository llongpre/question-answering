   Scientists found the partial skeleton of an
Ice Age bison in the Mojave Desert, more evidence that the parched
landscape once was forested and crossed by streams, a researcher
said Wednesday.
   The discovery of the 10,700-year-old fossil in Red Rock Canyon
State Park was the first time researchers have found the partial
skeleton of a large Ice Age animal in the vast desert, said
paleontologist David Whistler, curator of the Natural History
Museum of Los Angeles County.
   Single bones of bison, mammoths, camels and horses had been
found previously, along with numerous bones of 25 other species,
including frogs, lizards, snakes, shrews, bats, a mountain gopher
and lemming-like creatures called voles, he added.
   ``The desert is no more than 10,000 years old. These fossils,
including the bison, reinforce that knowledge,'' Whistler said.
``This further confirms that the desert was once much cooler and
much wetter.''
   At the time the bison roamed the Mojave, the area was ``a
pinyon-juniper scrub forest, like what you'd find in northern
Arizona today,'' he said, adding that the types of fossilized
creatures indicate the area also had lakes and year-round cold
water streams.
   Whistler said that on May 27, a single fist-sized vertebra from
the bison was spotted in an ancient streambed in the state park by
Pam Owen, a paleontology graduate student at California State
University, Long Beach.
   Scientists then unearthed about one-third of the bison's
skeleton, which was broken in various pieces. The rest of the bison
had been exposed by erosion over the ages and had weathered away.
   ``I'm afraid Mother Nature got about two-thirds of it and we got
about one-third,'' Whistler said. ``We've got part of the chest,
part of a hip, a shoulder blade, a hind leg, and about five
isolated teeth.''
   Red Rock park officials asked Whistler not to reveal the exact
digging site, but he said it was close to State Route 14, the main
highway through the park, which is located about 100 miles north of
Los Angeles.
   The bison's worn teeth and arthritic bones show it was old when
it died, Whistler said, adding that the species went extinct and
was different than modern bison.
   Radiocarbon dating of fossil wood in the streambed near the
bison allowed scientists to determine it died about 10,700 years
ago.
   Museum spokeswoman Ellen Girardeau said the bison fossils will
be used for research and won't be displayed. They will be moved to
Los Angeles late this month.
