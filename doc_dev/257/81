   A City University professor says he has solved
the mystery of who was behind the 1912 ``Piltdown Man'' fraud, which
rocked the scientific community and provided fodder for a
decades-long whodunit.
   Dr. Frank Spencer, anthropology professor at Queens College, a
branch of City University, said in a telephone interview today that
the names of many prominent scientists, and even mystery maven Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, had been mentioned as ``suspects'' through the
years.
   But his research, bolstered by that of Australian historian Ian
Langham, points the finger at Sir Arthur Keith, a well-respected
anatomist and conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons.
   Spencer lays out the premise for the fraud in two new books to be
published this fall by Oxford University Press.
   Piltdown, a small village in England, made international news in
1912 when a skull and jaw of what became known as the ``Piltdown
Man'' were discovered in a gravel pit.
   ``It was sensational because it offered a completely different
view of evolution at the time,'' Spencer said.
   But in 1953 the discovery was completely debunked when it was
learned the remains were actually a human skull _ only a couple of
hundred years old _ with an orangutan's jaw fused to it.
   Still, the larger question remained _ who did it?
   Fingers immediately pointed to Charles Dawson, the country lawyer
who made the discovery, but the scientific community believed
someone else had to be involved.
   The names of scientist William J. Sollas, philosopher Pierre
Teilhard de Chardin and even Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes inventor who
lived nearby, kept coming up. But there was never any proof and
often no motive.
   ``The general feeling was that Piltdown was contrived to bring
somebody down, make someone in the scientific community look
silly,'' Spencer said, but that theory didn't work because ``if that
was the case, why didn't anyone ever do that?''
   Spencer said once he began looking at the evidence with the
viewpoint that Dawson's co-conspirator was someone who had something
to gain intellectually, not monetarily, he began to look at Keith.
   But his search for documents collided with the efforts of
Langham, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia, and
Spencer said he ``backed off'' and allowed Langham to continue his
research alone.
   When Langham died in 1984 without concluding his research,
Spencer said, Langham's widow asked him to continue her husband's
work.
   He said the turning point was entries in Keith's diary ``in which
he indicates he had information about the site and events at
Piltdown ... which he wouldn't have had unless he was an inside
member of the group. This was really the crux of the thing.''
   Spencer said he and Langham also uncovered the fact that Keith, a
scientist who backed the theory of evolution that came out of
Piltdown, had met with Dawson a year before the discovery and again
just several months before.
   Though Spencer believes he and Langham have cracked the Piltdown
mystery, doubting Thomases still abound.
   Dr. Fred H. Smith, a paleontologist at the University of
Tennessee at Knoxville, told The New York Times that Spencer makes a
``good case'' but ``it's not ironclad.''
   Dr. William Ball, a former keeper of paleontology at the British
Museum, said until someone comes up with a signed confession,
questions surrounding Piltdown will remain.
