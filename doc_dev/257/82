Strangers have forever been coming to dig precious things out of Montana's 
ancient dirt -- sapphires, copper, fossils -- digging them up and carting them 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. This time the home team won. The trophy stays put. A museum 
right here, with exhibits that can run to barbed wire, frontier fashions and 
Rocky Mountain stargazing, has pulled off the grand slam, the Triple Crown, the 
Academy Award of saurian paleontology: the biggest, most complete Tyrannosaurus 
Rex skeleton ever found. 
</P>
<P>
It is a handsome textbook specimen, and "just about everybody would like to 
have it," Museum of the Rockies project coordinator Pat Leiggi said primly. 
"But it's ours." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy and Tom Wankel are the Montana ranching couple who turned up the skeleton 
on a bone-hunting outing in the Montana badlands some time back, unearthing a 
bit with a garden shovel and a jackknife. The first complete bone Kathy Wankel 
ever found turned out to be the first complete T-Rex arm anyone had ever found. 
</P>
<P>
When they somewhat diffidently drove it over to the Museum of the Rockies at 
Montana State University and found out what it was, "we wanted it to stay 
here," Kathy Wankel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of a sore spot that all these out-of-staters come and take 
the bones out and we get nothing for it," she said. "I'm a true Montanan. And 
we need some nice, clean tourist industry." 
</P>
<P>
Montana is a perfect boneyard of dinosaurs. Wherever else they lived, this was 
an excellent place for them to die, preserved in 65-million-years worth of clay 
soil. For decades, fossils have been dug up and carried off to big-name, 
big-bucks institutions. Six of the seven T-Rex skeletons ever found were found 
in Montana. This one, which the Wankel boys call Mr. T, is the first to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Leiggi doesn't begrudge that. In the past, no local institution could handle 
fossils the way the big out-of-state bone boys could. "For other museums and 
programs to take things out of the state seemed perfectly justified," Leiggi 
said. "But now we're part of this network," and "people are proud of the fact 
that not only is the dinosaur recognized as being from Montana but is staying 
in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
The paleontology department has gone from zero to bingo in a handful of years, 
thanks to renowned paleontologist John Horner, a Montana native who years ago 
went off to Princeton to work. He came back home to dig, but whatever treasures 
he found he took away with him. When some fellow Montanans called him a "grave 
robber," Leiggi says Horner answered: ' "When there's a job for me to come home 
to, I'll come back.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, he did, creating the first true paleontology department in the state. 
Horner's groundbreaking work in baby dinosaurs, in habitat and in nesting 
behavior, has helped to forge a world-class department. "There isn't anybody 
producing anything about dinosaurs who isn't calling us," Leiggi said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all its reputation among peers, the Museum of the Rockies does not 
exactly top the nation's vacation itineraries, like the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but wait. T-Rex was not even out of the ground and the public was wild to 
see this screaming tabloid of a dinosaur, the big megilla, with teeth like 
daggers and an appetite like a sawmill. It's like Leiggi says: You turn up a 
new duckbill, discover a colony of maiasaurs, and people say, that's nice. "The 
Wankels find a T-Rex, and the world gets excited overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight excitement takes time to satisfy. Leiggi will soon set up shop in the 
dinosaur hall, cleaning the T-Rex layer by layer in public view. Already they 
have learned much from this skeleton, nearly twice as complete as any other 
ever found. 
</P>
<P>
The arm upended common wisdom that the T-Rex's arms, the size of a man's, were 
vestigial at best. Project worker Matt Smith has studied its biomechanics and 
found that size is not necessarily function; those scrawny little arms, arms 
the T-Rex couldn't even see, could hang onto more than 400 pounds, 10 times 
what a man's can. 
</P>
<P>
The plaster and burlap-wrapped pieces arrived July 3 after 28 days of digging 
at a secret site. Even then word had leaked, and dinosaur buffs were begging to 
help excavate. "It's just me and my kid," they would plead, "and he's a good 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
Not a chance. The skeleton lay in an old stream bed, its back arched in rigor 
mortis. The team had to dig the bones free in separate blocks, like vast chunks 
of peat, tunneling and squirming beneath them to make sure they'd gotten 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
Hoisting the 6,500-pound pelvic block had everybody sweating. Had it fallen, 
someone working beneath it would have been killed, Leiggi said. 
</P>
<P>
And forget what the science-fiction movies show. In all of Earth's history, it 
would have been the only human being to be killed by a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
