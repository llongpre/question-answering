<P>
Life on Earth had an easy birth, but a difficult childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have recently painted a startling new picture of the Earth's early 
history, which, among other things, suggests that our planet once suffered 
through a super ice age from which it almost did not recover. 
</P>
<P>
The new scenario fills an evolutionary gap that has puzzled researchers for 
decades. According to one researcher, our previous conception of the early 
history of Earth "has been stood on its head." 
</P>
<P>
The discoveries are also helping scientists understand why it took more than 2 
billion years for complex plants and animals to appear on the Earth, and why 
their appearance in the fossil record is so abrupt. And the new information is 
helping scientists appreciate the crucial role of carbon dioxide in regulating 
the Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
This newly emerging picture is providing more and better information about the 
development of the global environment, especially at the crucial point in time 
when the atmosphere was changing from anaerobic, which could not support human 
life, to aerobic, which could. 
</P>
<P>
Because the conditions at that time were unique, such a scenario is unlikely to 
occur on Earth again, but the information learned about that period will help 
researchers determine if life could have developed on other planets and in 
other solar systems, and how it might have evolved. 
</P>
<P>
What researchers have learned is that, a little more than a billion years ago, 
the Earth's oceans were teeming with microscopic life -- blue-green algae, 
phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and thousands of other single-celled species, the 
product of 2.5 billion years of slow evolution. 
</P>
<P>
These microorganisms were proliferating so rapidly that they used up most of 
the carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing the life-giving warmth 
normally trapped by atmospheric carbon dioxide to radiate into space -- the 
opposite of the greenhouse effect that climatologists now fear is warming the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glaciers at Equator 
</P>
<P>
Within 400 million years, the globe had cooled to the point where glaciers 
covered the Equator at sea level, and as many as two-thirds of all the species 
on the planet had been snuffed out by cold. This "snowball Earth," researchers 
say, came perilously close to being forever entombed in ice, and was rescued 
only by the release of more carbon dioxide from the Earth's mantle by 
volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
That super ice age was much longer and much colder and had greater impact on 
living organisms than normal ice ages. Normal ice ages, which are caused by 
natural variations in the Earth's orbit, persist about 100,000 years, with 
10,000- to 20,000-year intervals of warmth between them. The super ice age was 
superimposed on top of this normal pattern of ice ages and lasted for tens of 
millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the world's ecological system collapsed slowly," paleobiologist 
J. William Schopf of UCLA said. "That sort of thing has never been observed 
anytime before or since. It's completely different from the sort of extinctions 
one thinks about in the rest of the geological record." 
</P>
<P>
But the Earth made a miraculous recovery and, as the planet slowly warmed, new 
forms of life began to appear -- multicelled organisms with hard shells or 
internal bone structures unlike anything that preceded them in the fossil 
record. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, geologist Joseph Kirschvink of Caltech said, the slow creep of 
glaciers to the Equator had the effect of "scraping off the planet down to the 
bone, so that life suddenly had a new environment to inhabit." And once those 
new environmental niches were established, life proliferated and evolved 
rapidly, progressing from simple multicelled organisms all the way to humans in 
only 600 million years, less than 15% of the Earth's history. 
</P>
<P>
The result of this remarkable picture of the Earth's adolescence, geochemist 
John M. Hayes of Indiana University said, is that "our approach to the Earth's 
history has been stood on its head." Where researchers once thought that levels 
of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere had changed only slowly and by 
only small amounts, he said, the new evidence has suggested much greater 
changes, accompanied by large changes in the nature of life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting times," Hayes said of the current research. "There are really 
fundamental ideas being changed and concepts being developed that are of the 
first magnitude in terms of their significance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-Country Research Project 
</P>
<P>
The new discoveries came from an unusual collaboration of more than 50 
researchers from 10 countries. They have been drawn together for the past five 
years in an unprecedented research project under the aegis of Schopf, head of 
UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life. 
</P>
<P>
The group, called the Precambrian Paleobiologic Research Group -- Proterozoic, 
or PPRG -- P, has carried out an extensive series of biological and geological 
field trips and collected more than 1,800 rock specimens for laboratory 
analysis -- an unprecedented number of specimens for this period of history. 
</P>
<P>
The Precambrian Era, the period from the Earth's formation about 4.5 billion 
years ago until roughly 570 million years ago, has long been a source of 
puzzlement because the fossil record -- the mineralized remains of plants and 
animals -- appeared to begin abruptly roughly 570 million years ago. The oldest 
fossils that had been discovered, until about 40 years ago, were of trilobites, 
hard-shelled, segmented forerunners of modern insects, spiders and crabs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, however, the late Stanley Tyler of the University of Wisconsin 
and Elso S. Barghoorn of Harvard University showed that unusual microscopic 
structures found in quartzite rock from the northern shores of Lake Superior 
were actually fossils of algae dating from 2.1 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Schopf and others have found still older fossils, the most 
ancient being 3.5-billion-year-old fossils of slimy green bacteria that 
colonized muddy ponds in western Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their great age, the fossils Schopf discovered were not as simple as 
might have been expected. In fact, they formed filaments and colonies that did 
not seem much different from those formed by similar algae and bacteria today. 
Schopf and others concluded that life must have begun fairly soon after the 
Earth was formed, perhaps within the first half-billion years, for evolution to 
have progressed that far. 
</P>
<P>
But in solving one mystery, Schopf had created another. If life could begin and 
evolve into sophisticated bacteria so easily in the first few hundred million 
years of the planet's history, why were another 2 billion years required before 
the first multicelled organisms appeared? 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a vast amount of time," said micropaleontologist Carl V. 
Mendolson of Beloit College in Beloit, Wis. "We're trying to read this book of 
life based on very few pages." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the work of the PPRG-P, though, researchers are beginning to pull 
together the first comprehensive picture of what the Earth must have been like 
during the Proterozoic Period, that portion of the Precambrian Era ranging from 
2.5 billion years ago up to 570 million years ago. And that picture "strains 
some of the evolutionary scenarios that have been widely accepted," 
geophysicist J. John Sepkoski Jr. of the University of Chicago said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accelerated Pace 
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists have long believed that the Proterozoic was characterized by 
continuous and slow evolution, a process that led naturally to the evolution of 
the complex, multicellular species. But the new evidence indicates, Sepkoski 
said, "that is not at all correct. Early on in the Earth's history, a 
reasonably stable (biological) community was put together and it really didn't 
change through the Proterozoic." 
</P>
<P>
Only when the climate underwent a near-catastrophic upheaval at the end of the 
Proterozoic did the evolutionary pace begin to accelerate again. "There wasn't 
an evolutionary march toward greater and greater complexity, toward modernity, 
but a record of jumps and starts," Sepkoski said. 
</P>
<P>
The key evidence supporting this new scenario of the Earth's evolution lay in 
the residual magnetism of 1-billion-year-old rocks studied by George E. 
Williams of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization 
and Brian J. J. Embleton of Macquarie University, both in North Ryde, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
That magnetism indicates that Australia was on the Equator a billion years ago. 
Evidence from sediments formed at that time also indicates the continent was 
covered by glaciers. If Australia, on the Equator, was covered by glaciers, 
then the whole world must have been, because the ice would have spread from the 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the glaciers form? Scientists blame the loss of carbon dioxide from the 
Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carbon Not Released 
</P>
<P>
About 1 billion years ago, the Earth's oceans were filled with microscopic life 
that extracted carbon dioxide from the air and converted it into sugar 
molecules that became part of their cellular structures. 
</P>
<P>
As they died naturally, the microorganisms drifted to the bottom of seas and 
were buried in sediments, so that the carbon they contained could not be 
released back into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Today this process is comparatively rare because the bulk of the microorganisms 
are eaten by animals and their carbon recycled through the food chain. Most 
researchers agree that the circumstances that caused global glaciation were 
unique and that the event could not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"Organic carbon was being buried at rates as high as anything we've seen in the 
last billion years," said Andrew Knoll of Harvard, whose study of sediments has 
been crucial in documenting the changes in carbon dioxide levels. 
</P>
<P>
As new generations of microorganisms removed more and more carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere, temperatures slowly grew colder and glaciers crept toward the 
Equator from both poles, eventually enveloping the whole planet. 
</P>
<P>
As the climate cooled, whole species began dying off, Schopf said. According to 
the fossil record, he added, "at least half, maybe two-thirds of the things 
that were alive didn't make it after about 600 million years ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Life Died 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that saved the Earth from completely freezing over, apparently, 
was the fact that most life had died off. Living organisms were therefore no 
longer removing much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the carbon dioxide 
released by volcanoes began accumulating, gradually warming the planet. 
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable coincidence, researchers said, at just about this time oxygen 
began accumulating in the atmosphere. Living organisms thus confronted an 
ecology that had been stripped of most of the previous life forms and had an 
abundance of oxygen to meet their needs. 
</P>
<P>
Climatologists know that the first fossils of multicellular animals are found 
in sediments lying immediately above those deposited during the glacial period 
-- and they are found all over the world. "Some external event triggered the 
ability of organisms to mineralize and grow larger . . . and one very good 
possibility is the oxygenation of the atmosphere," biologist Bruce Runnegar of 
UCLA said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of all the tectonic, atmospheric and environmental shifts, said Knoll, 
"we have to conclude that the world changed in a fairly fundamental way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Super Ice Age 
</P>
<P>
Earth was in danger of becoming totally encased in ice forever 
</P>
<P>
Researchers trying to solve they mystrey of why complex creatures suddenly 
appeared on the Earthsome 570 million years ago have pieced together a 
stratling new picture of an Earth that almost became a massive ball of ice. As 
carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere by natural processes, the Earth 
grew colder until glaciers covered even the equator. As many as two-thirds of 
all species were killed off in the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earth 
</P>
<P>
800 million years ago 
</P>
<P>
Earth's land masses were concentrated into two large supercontinents, centered 
on the equator. When the amount of carbon dioxide in the air reached its lowest 
level, Earth was encased in ice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earth 
</P>
<P>
600 million years ago to now 
</P>
<P>
The extinction of so many species, combined with growing concentrations of 
oxygen in the air, allowed new forms of organisms to appear and begin to spread 
over the planet in a new stage in theevolution of life on Earth. 
</P>

As carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere, the Earth got colder and 
glaciers at the poles began to expand and move toward the Equator. Over time 
the glaciers ended up covering almostthe entire planet including the oceans.

Earth was saved from a permanent deep freeze when volcanoes erupted and 
released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus began a process to replace 
the carbon dioxide taken out by one-celledorganisms.
