   An 8,000-year-old village under the sea
has yielded an intriguing discovery: a water well thought to be the
oldest in the world.
   The archaeologist who found the well says it suggests ancient
man was smarter than previously thought.
   The 6-year-old dig beneath the Mediterranean seabed has already
turned up a trove of information about neolithic man. Findings
include the remains of stone houses, a fireplace preserved with its
charred wood, 23 buried skeletons, the bones of the animals the
villagers ate, the seeds they planted, the tools they made from
bone and stone.
   The latest excitement is over the discovery of several wells,
one of which was excavated and found to be 16 feet deep.
   Ehud Galili, the archaeologist heading the dig, said the village
is 7,700 to 8,000 years old, so that the well is some 1,000 years
older than the oldest well known until now.
   ``It is surprising because for the first time we have figured
out that prehistoric man was aware of the existence of water tables
under the ground and was able and had the proper technology to dig
these wells and to use this fresh water,'' he told reporters
visiting the site Thursday.
   ``As far as I know this is the oldest well discovered from that
period,'' he said.
   It raises fascinating questions: How did ancient man know that
if he dug deep enough, he would strike fresh water? And where did
he acquire the skill to sink a round shaft, paved with stone, in
much the same way as many modern wells are built?
   The well was full of prehistoric trash - bones, broken tools and
stones, Galili said. He speculated that at some point its water had
grown salty and it was turned into a garbage disposal pit.
   With the end of the Ice Age, the village disappeared beneath the
Mediterranean as melted ice raised the earth's sea levels. Sea sand
up to 12 feet thick preserved it.
   The village covers about 10 acres and lies beneath 39 feet of
water about 400 yards off the coast.
   It is in a small bay overlooked by a Crusader fort at Athlit, 10
miles south of the port city of Haifa. The dig is sponsored by the
government's Antiquities Authority.
   Like many underwater sites off Israel's coast, it came to light
because the creation of the Jewish state in 1948 led to a
construction boom. Huge amounts of beach sand were quarried,
depleting the protective layer over the undersea sites.
   For archaeologists, the underwater location is a cause for
crises. Every storm disrupts the ancient undersea world, and ``a
wall or a skeleton that has lain undisturbed for thousands of years
can be destroyed in a matter of weeks,'' Galili said.
   Among Galili's more striking finds is the skeleton of a woman
aged about 18, lying in a fetal position, her hand making a
clutching gesture.
   Nodules in the earholes of some skulls point to the inhabitants
having been divers, since such nodules result from a disease common
among people who spend too much time under water, he said.
   Galili said marks on the teeth in one skull suggest the man
worked with ropes, using his teeth to help knot them.
   While there is no indication the villagers had already
domesticated animals, the seeds found at the site imply that they
had learned to grow crops, Galili said.
