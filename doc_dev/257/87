<LEADPARA>  GENETICISTS have discovered a chromosome thought to carry a gene that
regulates the desire to cook food outdoors in an ostentatious manner.;    The
gene, which has been dubbed the GG for Grilling Gene, has been found in both
males and females, but is much more dominant in the male.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Scientists say the GG can be found in no other form of life, including
chimpanzees and dolphins.;    "This is a very exciting and significant
discovery," said Dr. Harvey Whitecoals at a press conference held at Johns
Hopkins University, where the discovery was made. "It explains a phenomenon
that heretofore we believed was psychological rather than physiological.;   
"Now millions of women around the world can rest assured that the men in their
lives are not suffering from a mental illness. We now know that because of
this chromosome, most men cannot stop themselves from hooking their thumbs
into their suspenders every weekend, swaggering and saying in a John Wayne
tone of voice: 'Honey, ah think ahm gonna fire up the grill tonight.' ";   
Whitecoals said scientists believe the GG regulates the release of a hormone
called dangerone, which intensifies a drive to play with dangerous tools and
substances such as forks long enough for the devil, flames high enough to burn
down a house, and propane tanks. In many males, dangerone combines with smoke
to trigger imperious behavior.;    This announcement came as no surprise to
the folks at Weber-Stephen Products Co. in Palatine, Ill., which makes Weber
kettles and gas grills.;    "Grilling has always been this almost Neanderthal
thing that men do. It's very much a macho type of endeavor," said Jim Forbes,
Weber's vice president of sales.;    In all its nearly 40 years of
manufacturing grills, the company has never been quite so forthright about the
symbiosis of men and grills.;    In a new line of advertisements appearing in
food and other magazines, Weber's Genesis barbecue grill is shown in front of
a red phallic Corvette.;    "One of these babies really cooks," says the
headline. The advertising copy piles on the bait: "No other high performance
machine can move you quite like the Weber Genesis Gas Barbecue. Just start it
up. The Crossover ignition fires up the burners with over 36,000 BTUs of fuel
efficient power to go from zero to 550 degrees in minutes . . . a remarkable
feat of engineering. . . . This high performance machine will cost you $58,000
less than the one in the back . . . (and) it'll take you a lot farther on a
tank of gas.";    Just like any sexy car, the Genesis ranges in price. It goes
for $450 to $950 because it has a variety of options. Alas, hot air bags are
not among them.;    The Weber people have done numerous consumer surveys to
find out how families feel about grills and grilling. Some of the surveys show
that various forces in society -- namely, fatherless households, two-career
couples and perhaps the women's liberation movement -- have led to more
females manning outdoor grills.;    And when surveyors asked couples who most
often lights the grill, it turned out to be the woman of the house.
Ritualistically, women prepare grills and watch men heave big, red slabs of
carrion onto them in caveman fashion.;    Betty Hughes, a Weber home economist
for nearly 30 years, has seen male/female use of grills slowly changing, but
she admitted there is no getting around what is known of in Weber circles as
"The Passing of the Tongs.";    This refers to the fact that the current
yuppie generation is the first to have grown up with backyard grilling.;   
This, Hughes said, arises from a domino effect that occurred after World War
II. Suburbs sprang up. They had back yards. Back yards lent themselves to
grilling. Our fathers did the grilling and, according to Hughes, "passed the
tongs" on to their sons.;    "The sign of reaching adulthood and of gaining
maturity is owning their own barbecue grill," said Mike Kempster, Weber's
senior vice president of sales and marketing.;    Whitecoals pooh-poohed such
sociological explanations, saying at his press conference that they do not
fully explain male domination and behavior when it comes to grilling. He said
"The Passing of the Tongs" described by Weber officials has probably only
served to reinforce the GG's functioning.;    He added that, encouraged by the
discovery of the GG, researchers have set about isolating a companion gene
they have tentatively dubbed the MG, which they feel must regulate the male
urge to marinate.  </TEXT>
