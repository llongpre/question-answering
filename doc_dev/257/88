<LEADPARA>  NEW fossil discoveries in China, hailed as among the most spectacular in this
century, show that the dramatic transformation of life from primeval
single-cell organisms to the complex multicellular precursors of modern fauna
was more sudden and widespread than scientists had thought.;    From
cream-colored sediments of what was a sea floor 570 million years ago,
paleontologists have extracted specimens of 70 species of trilobites, worms,
sponges and various ancestors of crustaceans, spiders and insects.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Scientists detailed their study of the fossils in the current issue of
Research and Exploration. They say they are not sure what touched off this
riotous proliferation of more advanced life forms after 3 billion years in
which life never rose above the rudimentary level of bacteria, algae and some
primitive worms.; HUBBLE REPAIR COSTS; Proposed corrections of the flawed
mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope could cost at least $50 million, Hubble
project officials said on Monday, the first anniversary of the launching of
the telescope.;    The general plan is for shuttle astronauts to visit the
telescope in 1993 and replace its main camera with a new model that will
compensate for the blemish in the telescope's main 94.5-inch mirror.;    The
unresolved question is whether to also compensate for flaws in the operation
of three other critical instruments: two spectrographs and the faint-object
camera.;    The system of corrective optics, known as Costar, for Corrective
Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, will be reviewed by NASA next
month.; LEAD TESTING URGED; Every American child under 1 year of age should
have his or her blood screened for toxic levels of lead, a committee of the
Centers for Disease Control announced Monday.;    The CDC must approve the
recommendation before a policy statement is issued to the nation's
pediatricians. Approval is expected this summer.;    Children are most likely
to be exposed to lead by eating sweet-tasting paint chips containing lead.;   
Studies have linked even slightly elevated lead levels in children with higher
high-school dropout rates, learning disabilities, brain damage and anemia, a
lack of iron in the blood causing fatigue and weakness.;    Children with high
lead levels are treated with chelation therapy, a process that removes lead
absorbed in the bones so that it can be excreted.  </TEXT>
