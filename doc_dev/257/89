   A pop-eyed bug believed to be the world's oldest
insect, discovered almost by accident in a chunk of mud, suggests
that insects may have originated millions of years earlier than once
thought, scientists say.
   To the uninitiated, the fossil looks like two small specks.
   But to paleozoologist Conrad Labandeira and colleagues, the bug
found on the north shore of Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec, Canada, is
the oldest known insect, dating back some 390 million years.
   The finding is reported in Friday's issue of the journal Science,
which describes remarkably well-preserved fragments of a wingless
bug belonging to the most primitive order of insects and similar to
the modern-day silverfish.
   Even more significant than the fossil's age, scientists say, is
its similarity to modern bugs, which suggests that insects
originated many millions of years before the specimen lived.
   ``What we have is two fragments. We have a head capsule .7
millimeters wide and we have a thorax 1 millimeter long,'' said
Labandeira, a 38-year-old graduate student at the University of
Chicago.
   ``Even though they're separate, we're very convinced that they
belong to the same individual,'' he said Friday.
   The fossil was found by Francis Hueber, a noted Smithsonian
Institution paleobotanist, who retrieved the specimen about five
years ago while examining a mud sample he found on the Gaspe
Peninsula.
   Its importance was only recently discovered when he and other
scientists compared notes.
   Hueber's interest was in prehistoric plant fragments in the dirt,
but what looked like ancient insect parts caught his eye.
   ``He had an idea that there was something very important'' about
the fragments, Labandeira said.
   Through sophisticated dating techniques, Hueber ``determined that
it was an early arthropod and probably an insect,'' said Bret Beall,
a scientist at Chicago's Field Museum who has been working with the
specimen.
   ``He knew that if this was an insect fossil it would be very
significant,'' Beall said.
   Hueber gave the specimen to Beall, who _ with Labandeira's help _
determined that it was in fact a bug and what they believe is the
world's oldest known insect.
   It lived 390 million to 392 million years ago and the scientists
say it predates by about 15 million years what previously was
believed to be the oldest insect _ represented by an eye fragment
found in upstate New York.
   The bug's most imposing features are two disproportionately large
eyes on each side of its head. It also had two antennae and two
armlike appendages that appear to have been equipped with sensors to
detect odors and vibrations.
   ``The significance is that they have a head, so it's really a
clincher that there were insects at that time,'' said William Shear,
a biology professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, where the
New York specimen is being studied.
   ``The exciting thing to me is that these insects have changed
very little as far as we know in almost 400 million years,'' Shear
said. ``That suggests that they were almost already modern in form
400 million years ago, that they had a long history before that,''
he said.
   The newly discovered fossil eventually will be sent to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington for its permanent collections,
Labandeira said.
