   Did we all descend from Eve, an African woman
whose offspring quite literally conquered the world?
   Though of course no one knows her name, some biologists and
anthropologists believe that all humanity traces its roots to just
one woman. This idea, known as the Eve hypothesis or the Garden of
Eden theory, is intriguingly simple:
   Eve lived in sub-Saharan Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. As
the ancestors of modern humans, her children and grandchildren
spread throughout Africa and eventually across the world,
triggering the extinction of other primitive peoples.
   Or so some scientists believe.
   Others ridicule the idea. The theory, based on a comparison of
the genes of people around the world, is one of the most hotly
conteste controversies in the often-rancorous field of human
origins.
   At a meeting earlier this year of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, both sides argued their cases with
facts, speculation and sarcasm.
   Allan C. Wilson of the University of California at Berkeley, one
of the architects of the Eve hypothesis, said the evidence is so
strong that the ``argument is done, clinched, finished. It's over.''
   Not quite, countered the other side.
   ``There are serious and obvious flaws in the Eve hypothesis,''
said Geoffrey G. Pope of the University of Illinois.
   Most everyone agrees that small-brained, humanlike creatures
arose in Africa 1.5 million to 2 million years ago. They spread
throughout Africa, Europe and Southeast Asia and flourished for
hundreds of thousands of years.
   But what became of them? The theory favored by Pope and many
fossil experts holds that those creatures, known as homo erectus,
are the true ancestors of us all.
   If they are right, these early hominids parted company in Africa
but went on to evolve in unison. Useful genetic changes that arose
in small pockets of population slowly spread throughout the world
as neighboring tribes mingled. After thousands of centuries, they
became us _ modern humans who differ only in superficial racial
features.
   However, Garden of Eden theorists believe those early settlers
disappeared leaving no trace in humanity's genes. Instead, they say
they have evidence that a new kind of people arose in Africa much
more recently. Their kin also spread throughout the prehistoric
world, somehow killing off or squeezing out the European
Neanderthals and other descendants of the first wave out of Africa.
   The difference between the scenarios is so stark that there
seems to be no middle ground, no room for compromise.
   ``There is no question on this issue,'' said Alan G. Thorne of
the Australian National University, an Eve skeptic. ``One of us is
absolutely wrong.''
   The debate began about three years ago with the use of new
scientific techniques to look for signs of the family tree inside
the genes of modern humans. This intrusion of the glitzy tools of
molecular biology have not always been accepted graciously by the
traditional fossil hunters, who rely largely on meticulous
measurements and comparisons of bone fragments to fathom human
origins.
   David W. Frayer, a Neanderthal expert from the University of
Kansas, said the quick acceptance of Eve reflects a preference for
sensational catastrophe over mundane gradual change, as well as a
``willingness of some to accept without criticism, or even
suspicion, the results of molecular biology.''
   Molecular biology's role has been to decipher the genetic
information inside mitochondria. These are structures within human
cells that help produce energy.
   Mitochondria have their own genes, separate from the chromosomes
that carry all the other blueprints for human beings. Ordinary
genes are a mishmash contributed equally by mothers and fathers.
Mitochondrial genes are passed along only by mothers.
   Therefore, each new generation gets an almost exact copy of the
mitochondrial genes of their forebears. The only difference is the
occasional variation caused by genetic mutations.
   These mutations are the key to reading mitochondrial genes as a
clock. Biologists believe they know how quickly the mutations
occur. By comparing the degree of mutation in the genes of people
from different parts of the world, they believe they can trace the
various lines back to the point at which they all converge: Eve.
   The latest study of this sort, conducted by Linda Vigilant at
Berkeley, uses hair roots plucked from 199 people from Europe,
Asia, New Guinea and seven ethnic groups in Africa. Analyzing the
root genes, she calculates all the people descended from a common
ancestor who lived in Africa 207,000 years ago. This female's
descendants evolved into physically modern humans by 100,000 years
ago.
   As neat as the idea seems, anthropologists attack it on several
grounds.
   One is whether the mutations in mitochondrial genes occur like
clockwork. The critics argue that the biologists are overly
confident that they know the tempo at which the mitochondrial clock
is ticking.
   Milford H. Wolpoff of the University of Michigan contends the
clock's rhythm is hopelessly thrown off by the dead ends of all-boy
families. Whenever a family produces no girls, the orderly
accumulation of genetic mutations stops cold. No mitochondrial
genes are passed to the next generation.
   ``If there is a clock,'' said Thorne, ``it needs new batteries.''
   Other scientists point to the fossil record, the teeth and bits
of bone that remain from the ancient beings.
   If the Eve theory is correct, the new wave of humans migrating
out of Africa 1,000 centuries ago did not mate and mingle their
genes with the ancient hominids that already lived in Europe and
Asia. Instead, they replaced them completely.
   Some fossil experts believe they have found clear signs that
traits of those ancient peoples have been passed down to modern
humans. For instance, Pope argues that 1 million-year-old fossils
from ancient Asia have the same cheekbones and wisdom teeth as
modern Asians.
   This similarity in facial features ``indicates that the Eve
hypothesis is completely untenable in Asia.''
   Frayer also believes he can see echoes of Neanderthal skulls and
teeth in later generations of Europeans.
   Allison S. Brooks of George Washington University questions Eve
on behavioral grounds. She said that if modern humans overran
Europe, replacing the dimwitted natives, there should also have
been a cultural revolution.
   However, she finds no abrupt change showing dramatically more
advanced stone tools or hunting techniques in Europe after the
supposed arrival of Eve's offspring.
