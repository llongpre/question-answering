<LEADPARA>  A Cretaceous Period insect, fossilized in amber, surrenders to scientists a
tiny fragment of DNA from the blood of a dinosaur it dined on seconds before
its death.;    Working in secret, scientists combine the dinosaur DNA with DNA
in eggs of modern amphibians. After weeks of incubation, out pops a tiny,
resuscitated dinosaur.  </LEADPARA>

WINDOW TO PAST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It sounds like a Stephen Spielberg movie -- and it will be -- but some
scientists believe the concept of regenerating long-dead animals from bits of
DNA is not so far-fetched.;    A major reason for their optimism is the recent
development of a laboratory technique called the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), which was invented by Emeryville scientists.;    A method for
amplifying minute quantities of genetic material, even if old and fragmentary,
it has prompted a run by scientists on museum collections of extinct animals
and plants, as well as on ancient human remains, in the hope of extracting any
DNA, the basic genetic material, that has survived the centuries.;    One of
these scientists is Dr. George O. Poinar Jr., a paleontologist at the
University of California, Berkeley. Based on his research, Poinar suggested
the dinosaur-resurrection scenario that became the basis of the best-selling
science-fiction novel "Jurassic Park," by Michael Crichton (1990, Knopf).;   
'Idea is quite plausible';  "I think the idea is quite plausible," Poinar
said, "and I feel the possibility for doing something like this will exist in
the future.";    Paleontologists and anthropologists have begun using the
technique as a window into the past, through which evolutionary paths,
migration patterns, kinship and other relationships can be brought to light.; 
  Some early fruits of this research will be reported at "Ancient DNA," the
first such international meeting, at the University of Nottingham in England
next month.;    How much of the distant past will prove visible through the
PCR window is still a matter of conjecture.;    No one can yet answer the most
basic questions, including how long DNA -- deoxyribonucleic acid -- can
survive, how much can be inferred from degraded sections of the huge DNA
molecules or how trustworthy the extraction processes may be.;    Scientists
wild about method;    Still, that has not stopped scientists at more than a
score of research institutions from enjoying themselves enormously in applying
the method to the DNA of objects as diverse as ancient Andean corn,
prehistoric Florida Indian brains, flightless New Zealand birds, leaves
preserved in shale for 17 million years and living bacteria from the gut of a
12,000-year-old mastodon found in Ohio.;    PCR analysis was invented and
patented in 1985 by scientists at the Cetus Corp. The instrument that
amplifies trace quantities of DNA is about the size of a shoe box.;    By
cyclically changing the temperature of the contents and by supplying various
building-block chemicals, the device splits apart paired strands of
corkscrew-shape DNA molecules and uses each strand as a template to create a
new DNA segment.;    With each repetition of the procedure, the number of
identical DNA segments is doubled, and trillions of copies can be manufactured
rapidly. The result is that fragments of DNA formerly too small to analyze can
be amplified easily for study.;    A feature of the system is that scientists
can select any section of interest from a DNA molecule -- typically, a single
set of genes -- and amplify only that part.;    Other uses of the method;   
PCR, a vital technique for those involved in pure research, has already found
practical use in identifying criminals, diagnosing genetic diseases and
detecting predispositions to certain types of cancer. But it has created an
especially powerful tool for paleontologists and anthropologists.;    The
excitement about the resuscitation potential of PCR is not universal.;    Dr.
Svante Paabo of the University of Munich, a molecular geneticist formerly of
the University of California, Berkeley, worked with Dr. Allan Wilson and Dr.
Russell G. Higuchi in 1984 on a landmark study of the DNA of the quagga, an
extinct South African animal related to the horse.;    From an analysis of DNA
extracted from a 140-year-old quagga skin preserved in a German museum, the
Berkeley group determined that the quagga was a distant relative of the horse.
Paabo believes it would be impossible to re-create the quagga from its DNA,
much less recreate a dinosaur.;    But Poinar remains optimistic. In 1982,
Poinar and his wife, Dr. Roberta Hess, also of UC-Berkeley, obtained and
examined a 40 million-year-old chunk of amber -- fossilized resin -- in which
a female fungus gnat was embedded.;    Gnat was well-preserved;  The tissues
and cells of the gnat were so well-preserved that the scientists concluded
that DNA might have survived in insects of similar age.;    Poinar did not
look for DNA in the fungus gnat, because the search would have required
destroying a very rare and valuable specimen.;    But, he said, biting insects
undoubtedly consumed blood and accompanying DNA from contemporary animals,
including dinosaurs, and some of this blood and DNA could survive, trapped in
amber.;    "Obviously, we couldn't reconstruct an extinct animal today, even
if we had all its DNA," he said in an interview. "However, my belief is that
there are dinosaur cells inside biting flies trapped in amber of (the)
Cretaceous age and older. It's just a matter of finding the dinosaur DNA and
getting it out."  </TEXT>
