Accolade's "Altered Destiny" turns a romantic evening for two into . . . "The 
Twilight Zone." It is a traditional adventure-style game with a good story set 
against an effective, entertaining science-fiction backdrop.

It's Friday night and regular guy P.J. Barrett makes a date with girlfriend 
Trudy Foxlitner to watch videos at his place. P.J. stops after work to pick up 
his television from the repair shop. Entering the shop, he passes a large, 
Neanderthal warrior carrying a television. You guessed it: P.J.'s TV. But 
neither the repair man nor P.J. wants to confront the big guy, so P.J. takes 
home a loaner. And that's when P.J.'s life turns really weird. As soon as P.J. 
turns on the TV, he gets sucked through the tube into somewhere described as 
"between here and there." Our hero immediately meets a disappointed, frail 
specter named JonQuah. (JonQuah was naturally expecting the warrior with the 
wrong television.) Settling for second best -- or just what he can get -- 
JonQuah gives P.J. the old you-must-save-the-universe routine and leaves him to 
drift down into a world of sci-fi fantasy.

While Accolade continues to provide excellent support for its adventurers, the 
company is still having trouble programming smooth movement functions for its 
characters. P.J. runs into a few spots that make play frustrating. Watch 
yourself in the Canyons of Fear and the Caves of Death.

Save often. Sometimes every few steps. Save at the Bottom of the Stairs -- and 
prepare to die -- a lot, while trying to cross the bridge.
