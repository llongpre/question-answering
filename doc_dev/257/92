<LEADPARA>  A few weathered teeth found near a plane wreck in the jungle. Hundreds of bone
fragments, smashed to slivers and scattered across an Ohio lawn. Sometimes
that's all that remains of a human being.;    Yet with these sparse clues,
scientists often can identify the victim years later -- whether a pilot
missing in action over Indochina or the victim of an accused serial killer in

<TEXT>     It's amazing what bones can tell. And, with a new type of genetic analysis
just beginning to spread from the research laboratory into practical use, it
should be possible to draw out the testimony of ever smaller and older bits of
the human skeleton.;    This year, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in
Washington, D.C., set up its first laboratory for genetic analysis to identify
remains of military personnel. And scientists at Cetus Corp. in Emeryville are
working on a kit that would simplify the new genetic tests for use in crime
labs across the country.;    'Great technique';    "It would be a great
technique if we could get it to work for us," said Madeleine Hinkes, a
forensic anthropologist at the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory in
Hawaii, which handles the unidentified remains of between 200 and 300 military
personnel per year, some still turning up from World War II.;    "We'd love
it. It's very frustrating to have these cases that we can't identify.";   
Families of service members missing in the Vietnam War have criticized the
military for identifying bodies based on a few skeletal fragments. Some have
refused to accept such remains for burial.;    Yet scientists who specialize
in bone analysis say these tiny scraps can be useful.;    It's theoretically
possible to identify a person from just one tooth, if its structure is
unusual, said Clyde Snow, an anthropologist at the University of Oklahoma, who
has worked on a number of well-known cases, including attempts to identify the
purported remains of Nazi war criminal Dr. Josef Mengele.;    'As unique as
fingerprints';    "Every bone of every individual is very unique," Snow said,
"not only in overall size and shape but in the details of the internal
structure. (Bones) are just as unique as fingerprints.";    The first step in
analysis, Snow said, is to distinguish human remains from those of animals, a
relatively easy process.;    Next, scientists examine the most informative
parts of the skeleton. Subtle features of the skull reveal the person's race
and sex; the pelvis, sex and age. The long bone of the leg, the femur, is
directly related to height.;    With the basics in hand, scientists compare
the remains to medical or dental records of missing people. Teeth are some of
the most revealing items, especially if a full set of dental X-rays is
available. "You can see the shapes of the roots, the insides of the teeth,
pulp cavities and all the other features, plus restorations," Snow said.;   
Most of the time, the traditional techniques are enough. Authorities in Ohio
said Friday that they hope to determine within 10 days whether hundreds of
bone and tooth fragments found near the Bath Township, Ohio, childhood home of
Jeffrey Dahmer belong to one of 17 men he is accused of murdering.;    But, in
other cases, there isn't enough bone to make an identification, or there are
no X-rays, photographs or detailed medical records for comparison.;    Role of
genetics;    That's where genetics comes in.;    The best-known genetic
technique, called "DNA fingerprinting," is increasingly used in courts to
establish paternity or link suspects with crimes. But it rarely works on old
bones, because genetic material in the nuclei of their cells is too
deteriorated, said Edward Blake of Forensic Science Associates in Richmond.;  
 So scientists are turning to another form of DNA. Found only in the
mitochondria -- small organs that produce energy in cells -- it has several
advantages over nuclear DNA that determines heredity.;    There are hundreds
of times more copies of mitochondrial DNA in each cell, increasing the chance
a few will survive over the years. And because it's passed only from women to
their offspring, it strongly links families. Unless a random mutation has
intervened, your mitochondrial DNA should be identical to those of your
mother, siblings and other maternal relatives.;    This means DNA drawn from
old bones can be matched with that in the blood of maternal relatives to
establish identification. Or it can be compared to locks of hair, stray
whiskers or other material left behind by a missing person.;    Mitochondrial
DNA has long been used for evolutionary studies of humans and other animals.
But only recently have researchers perfected techniques to extract usable
amounts from old materials, including bones.;    It was first used to identify
human remains in 1988, when Blake was given a small piece of a child's skull
found in a Southern California desert two years earlier. He identified it as
that of a 3-year-old girl who disappeared in 1984.;    Simplified kits needed;
   "Mitochondrial DNA is going to be a very valuable tool for the forensic
scientist," Blake said. But, since the present technique is too difficult for
most laboratories, he added, it will be necessary to develop simplified kits
that can be used by local investigators.;    Cetus Corp. is developing a kit,
said Henry Erlich, director of the company's human genetics department, but it
will not be ready for market for at least two years.;    In the meantime,
scientists at a handful of sophisticated laboratories across the country are
sharpening their ability to extract DNA from bones and teeth that are, in some
cases, hundreds of years old.;    "It works so easily and so well," said
Charles Ginther, a molecular biologist at the University of California,
Berkeley who has analyzed more than a dozen teeth.;    At the newly opened
Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory in Washington, analyst Deborah
Fisher is trying to find mitochondrial DNA in the bones of a soldier killed in
the Civil War.;    Maj. Victor Weedn, chief of the laboratory, has proposed
that the Pentagon take blood samples from all military personnel and freeze
them for later genetic identification tests. The laboratory already has used
genetic testing to reunite scattered body parts of dozens of Americans killed
in Operation Desert Storm, he said.;    "This is the first real war," he said,
"that there has not been a body buried in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.";  
 Forensic anthropology; Skeletal remains -- bones or teeth -- can reveal their
owner's age, sex, race and height. But that information is useless unless it
can be compared to information about specific people. Forensic anthropologists
comb the records of soldiers killed in battle or a police department's
missing-persons file to find possible matches. Then they compare the remains
to data on the missing people, such as medical and dental records or x-rays.
Here are some of their strategies:; Face -- Can reveal race and sex. The brow
ridge is more prominent in men than in women. By measuring a number of subtle
differences in facial features, anthropologists can identify a skull by race
about 90 percent of the time.; Back of skull -- The occipital bone at the base
of the skull -- the "soft spot" of newborns -- fuses and hardens at age 4 or
5. Eight other bones continue to grow as a person gets older; in combination,
their condition can establish a rough age of up to 36 years.; Pelvic bones --
A woman's pelvic opening is wider to accomodate childbirth.; Femur -- The
length of this leg bone is proportional to the person's height, which can be
calculated from tables based on measurements of thousands of skeletons.;   
Teeth -- Coated with tough enamel, they are more resistant to decay than other
parts of the skeleton and often better preserved. Each tooth is unique in the
shape of its pulp cavity, roots and crown and the nature of any dental work;
they can be identified by comparison with dental X-rays. The pattern of their
eruption also indicates the person's age.; Other bones -- Most bones are
unique in their size, shape and the details of their internal structure, which
are revealed by X-raying the remains. These X-rays are then compared to those
in the medical records of missing people. Medical records may also contain
details of injuries such as broken bones, or notations of other unusual
skeletal characteristics, that aid in identification.; Sources: Clyde Snow,
University of Oklahoma. "Witnesses From the Grave: The Stories Bones Tell," by
Christopher Joyce and Eric Stover.;    Mitochondrial DNA; What if there are no
good medical or dental records for comparison or there are only a few small
fragments of bone?; Advances in research have made it possible to extract
genetic material -- DNA -- from the bones and teeth of people long dead.
Identity can then be established by comparing these samples to samples from
living relatives.; Mitochondrial DNA is especially useful. It's found in
abundance in the energy-producing organs of cells, so chances are good that a
few copies will survive for years. And it's passed only from women to their
offspring, so a person's mitochondrial DNA should be identical to that of his
or her mother and siblings.; Here's how the analysis works.; Extract
mitochondrial DNA from bone or tooth fragments.; Amplify certain parts of the
DNA using a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, which can
produce thousands of copies in a short time.; Examine these sequences to see
if they match those of suspected maternal relatives.  </TEXT>
