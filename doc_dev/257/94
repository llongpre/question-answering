   Scientists have identified a
120-million-year-old fossil barely an inch tall as the world's
first known flower.
   The two Yale University researchers who announced the discovery
Thursday offered the fossil as evidence that flowering plants had a
more humble beginning than was previously thought.
   Scientists have long believed that the ancestors of today's
flowering plants were magnolia-like shrubs and trees with large
showy flowers.
   But Leo J. Hickey, a geologist, and David W. Taylor, a
biologist, advance a new theory of plant evolution in this week's
issue of the journal Science which argues that the earliest flowers
were impressive neither in size nor color.
   The new theory may help provide an explanation for what Darwin
called the ``abominable mystery'' behind the relatively sudden
evolutionary appearance of large flowering plants, the scientists
said.
   Darwin was mystified by the apparent lack of any obvious
ancestors to the plants.
   The fossil that Hickey and Taylor identified as a tiny flowering
plant from the middle age of the dinosaur was unearthed about 10
years ago in southeastern Australia, and belongs to the National
Museum of Victoria in Melbourne.
   The fossil had originally been labeled a fern, or nonflowering
plant.
   Taylor said he and Hickey were working on a new theory of the
ancestry of flowering plants when he came across a publication in
1988 which featured a picture of the ``fern.'' ``I said, `Ah ha,'
that looks like tiny flowers,'' he recalled.
   Using high-resolution photography, the scientists were able to
confirm that the fossil was a portion of a branch from an
angiosperm, a class of plant in which the seeds are enclosed in an
ovary.
   The flowers on the plant are less than a tenth of an inch long,
and are made up of a modified type of leaf with berries attached,
the scientists said. The coloring was believed to be brown or
greenish.
   They said the specimen probably came from a mature plant 6 to 12
inches in height and resembling today's black pepper plant.
   The discovery means scientists have been ``barking up the wrong
tree in their search for the earliest flowers, because it is not a
tree at all,'' Hickey said.
   Fossils of bird feathers, insects and conifers were also
uncovered at the site where the plant was found. The Yale
researchers said the absence of wood remains from large flowering
plants supported their hypothesis.
   Scientists have found pollen apparently from plants that existed
130 million years ago, but have yet to uncovered any actual remains
of flowers from that period.
   Until their discovery, the Yale scientists said the earliest
known flowers were specimens believed to be close to 115 million
years old.
   Peter Crane, an authority on early flowering plants from the
Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, called the discovery of
the 120-million-year-old plant exciting and said he was
fundamentally in sympathy with the theory advanced by the Yale
scientists.
   But he said ``a lot of other data has to be counted for'' and
that exactly what the first flowers looked like is still ``up for
grabs.''
