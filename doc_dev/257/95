   An archaeologist says he has dug up
primitive tools that suggest humans lived in North America 13,500
years earlier than the date commonly accepted by scientists.
   Don Wyckoff, director of the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey, said
Tuesday he is convinced his preliminary dating is accurate, but that
expensive testing is needed to prove the age of the tools unearthed
along with bison bones at a site near Alva in September.
   Carbon-dating tests on the bones were inconclusive, but Wyckoff
said the same test on snail shells found at the same level indicates
an age of 25,000 years.
   Based on current evidence, scientists have thought that ancient
humans first lived in North America about 11,000 to 11,500 years ago.
   Experts say carbon-testing on snail shells can be inaccurate
because snails incorporate old carbon molecules in their shells.
   ``These are the kind of dates that often turn out to be
inaccurately old,'' said Donald Grayson, professor of archaeology at
the University of Washington.
   Wyckoff acknowleges the problem, but said he is confident that
the discovery 30 miles west of Alva in northwest Oklahoma will prove
to be the oldest evidence of human inhabitation of North America.
   ``I feel pretty comfortable about the whole thing. The geological
context is good. I look at this location and I say it's got to be
old,'' Wyckoff said.
   The state agency he heads is affiliated with the University of
Oklahoma and uses its students for research and field work.
   Wyckoff reported on his initial findings last weekend at a
meeting of the Plains Anthropological Conference in Wichita, Kan.
   He said a resident came across bones in June 1986 while digging a
pond, and called the archaeological survey.
   A University of Kansas archaeologist, Larry Martin, who was
visiting at the time, recognized the skull of an ancient bison.
   ``We really weren't thinking that the site had anything to do
with people. We were just looking to get a look at what Oklahoma
looked like in the Ice Age,'' Wyckoff said.
   After more than a year of tedious sifting of dirt from the site,
the archaeologists turned up two flakes identified as debris from
resharpening of a stone tool.
   They then tried radiocarbon dating on the bones, but when that
didn't work, ``out of desperation we submitted a group of aquatic
snails that were present around the bison skull,'' Wyckoff said.
   The test, completed in October 1987, showed they were 31,150
years old _ give or take 700 years.
   Wyckoff said he allows another 20 percent for possible carbon
contamination to come up with the age of about 25,000 years.
   ``It would be very rare for a snail shell to be more than 20
percent contaminated,'' he said.
   The National Geographic Society turned them down for funding to
do the expensive accelerator dating, saying the few flakes were not
evidence enough of a human site.
   ``So we just decided we'll get a bunch of volunteers, go back up
and dig a few more squares. We did that in September, and recovered
a good broken tool as well as part of another tool and more
flakes,'' Wyckoff said.
   Wyckoff said it costs $600 a sample for testing by accelerator
dating, based on extracting specific proteins from tiny amounts of
material.
   Meanwhile, Wyckoff said he is awaiting the results, expected by
week's end, of another dating test based on the presence of uranium
thorium in the bison teeth.
   The Southern Methodist University doctoral student conducting
that test said that while his results aren't complete yet, ``he felt
like ... it was going to be fairly compatible with our'' age of
25,000 years, Wyckoff said.
   If so, he said it would be the most important archaeological find
in the last 60 years.
   ``If it is that old, it would be that important,'' said Grayson,
the Washington archaeologist.
   ``There's good reason to believe people were here earlier but we
haven't proved that yet,'' Grayson said.
