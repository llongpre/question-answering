</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thriving in pockets on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, California's 
giant sequoias have bucked the odds for millions of years, surviving raging 
fires, glacial ice and the violent upheavals that create mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that, despite their tumultuous history, the Sequoia groves are 
in good shape and growing vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
But now the trees are facing a new peril, a relatively sudden global warming 
that may occur as a result of the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are discovering that the sequoias are sensitive to subtle 
temperature variations associated with global climate changes. To survive, as 
they have in the past, the trees must have time to adjust, the experts report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sense of Urgency 
</P>
<P>
These new findings have added a sense of urgency to a study of sequoias under 
way here and in Yosemite. By analyzing tree growth rings, sediments cored from 
nearby meadows and the mummified droppings of pack rats that lived in caves 
along the Kings River 35,000 years ago, the experts hope to learn more about 
how the trees have lived so long and what it will take to ensure their 
continued existence. 
</P>
<P>
The Sequoiadendron giganteum is one of the oldest and largest living things on 
the planet. The prime specimen is the 2,700-year-old General Sherman Tree, 
standing nearly 275 feet tall, with a base diameter of 36 feet and a trunk 
weight of 1,385 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Fossil evidence of these giants has been found in Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada, 
indicating that the great forests existed there before the tectonic upthrust of 
the Sierra 6 million years ago. The towering Sierra blocked the flow of Pacific 
storms over the Great Basin, drying out the land, dooming the sequoias east of 
the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Today thousands of these trees are clustered in 75 groves on the pine-forested 
western Sierra slopes. The northernmost groves are in federal forests near Lake 
Tahoe, and they range south 250 miles to the Tule River drainage in Tulare 
County. Nearly half of the trees are in national parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bypassed Groves 
</P>
<P>
One riddle researchers are trying to solve is how the trees survived the Ice 
Age that ended 10,000 years ago. Originally, they theorized that perhaps the 
glaciers somehow had bypassed the groves. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, scientists were surprised to discover that the present-day 
groves date back only about 5,000 years. That meant that the groves surviving 
today did not come into existence until 5,000 years after the glaciers had 
melted away. 
</P>
<P>
New research, although far from conclusive, suggests that the groves survived 
by moving as the climate changed. Each new generation took root in a slow-step 
march up or down the mountains, seeking suitable climate, adequate soil 
moisture and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
As the glaciers advanced, the sequoias moved to lower elevations, and after the 
ice flows melted, the groves moved to their current locations. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery that the trees may, in fact, move in response to global 
temperature changes was made by paleo-ecologist Scott Anderson, director of 
Northern Arizona University's pollen laboratory in Flagstaff. Anderson studies 
the pollen found trapped in sediments in Log Meadow in Giant Forest to find out 
what kind of plants have lived in this part of the park since the glaciers 
melted. 
</P>
<P>
By coring 30 feet into the sediments, Anderson discovered that until 4,500 
years ago, the dominant plants were pines, huckleberry and chinquapin bushes -- 
vegetation typical of a dry, open forest, a place without enough moisture to 
support sequoia growth. 
</P>
<P>
"There was virtually no sequoia pollen in Log Meadow 6,000 years ago," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
From that time forward, evidence of the big trees began to accumulate in the 
sediments, indicating that the Giant Forest grove grew rapidly, expanding until 
it began to dominate the landscape. Meadow grasses and other plants requiring 
plenty of moisture also began to flourish, Anderson found. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence suggests that immediately after the last glacial period, the area 
was warm and dry. This bit of information coincides with a known warming period 
that lasted several thousand years because Earth's solar orbit and the tilt of 
its axis put the Northern Hemisphere closer to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, summer temperatures rose enough to dry out the soils. When 
cooler, wetter climate returned, the soil moisture increased and meadow-like 
conditions made the area ideal for sequoia growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Provide Clue 
</P>
<P>
All this may provide some clue as to how the sequoias may react to the kind of 
rapid global warming many scientists expect as a result of the greenhouse 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The altithermal (warm, dry period) is the best analog of what might happen if 
the greenhouse effect does occur," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
If temperatures do go up several degrees, as predicted, he said, "we would 
expect the type of vegetation that had grown in Log Meadow 6,000 to 10,000 
years ago . . . but no sequoias." 
</P>
<P>
The question then becomes what would happen to the sequoias. The supposition 
now is that the groves have survived climate changes by slowly moving and 
adapting to new locations, a natural process that requires thousands of years, 
park scientist Dave Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest information suggests that the sequoias move long distances in their 
struggle to survive. The evidence has come from an odd source: ancient pack rat 
nests found in limestone caves in a rugged, low-elevation canyon along the 
Kings River. 
</P>
<P>
No sequoias grow in this hot, dry canyon now, but contents of the pack rat 
middens strongly suggest that the trees once grew here, according to 
ranger-scientist Ken Cole. The rats use the same nests, generation after 
generation, accumulating twigs, rocks, bones, nesting materials and anything 
else they find and can carry back to the den. The rat's urine mummifies these 
droppings, preserving them for eons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pack Rats 
</P>
<P>
Cole found several pack rat middens in the caves in Kings Canyon National Park, 
just north of Sequoia Park. In these ancient nests, there were mummified pieces 
of sequoia twigs and pollen, evidence that thousands of years ago the trees 
were growing close by, at elevations as low as 3,000 feet. The closest sequoias 
today are miles away, at much higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dating revealed Cole's findings were 18,000 to 35,000 years old. That 
meant the trees were here during the coldest part of the last glacial period. 
</P>
<P>
This, according to Cole, is the first direct evidence that the sequoias grew at 
these lower elevations during the Ice Age. The supposition is that as the globe 
warmed and the glaciers melted, the trees marched back up the steep mountains 
to their present location at around 7,000 feet elevation. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the sequoias can out-maneuver the kind of rapid global warming 
scientists now are predicting as a result of the greenhouse effect is open to 
question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Release Gases 
</P>
<P>
Nature's slow-moving atmospheric clock has being speeded up by the impact of 
modern technology. As autos and industrial plants release more carbon monoxide 
and other gases into the air, more heat is trapped inside the atmospheric 
greenhouse. Some experts predict that temperatures could rise two to nine 
degrees over the next century. 
</P>
<P>
There is general scientific agreement that this global warming will occur at a 
rate 10 to 100 times faster than ever before, according to Stephen H. Schneider 
of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to temperature changes, scientists also are studying how sequoias 
react to fire and drought. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the late 1960s that national park officials realized that fire 
was an essential ingredient in the sequoia ecosystem. By suppressing fires for 
a century, rangers had literally disrupted the sequoia's reproductive cycle. No 
new sequoias were sprouting. 
</P>
<P>
Now rangers systematically torch off small sections of the groves in control 
burns designed to return fire to its natural place in the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Seedlings 
</P>
<P>
They set the blazes without fully understanding the role of fire, Ranger Bill 
Tweed explained. The new studies are showing that the hottest fires seemed to 
be followed by rapid regeneration of sequoias, while cooler, more deliberate 
burns produced fewer seedlings and a lower survival rate. The reason why is not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
To learn more, scientists from the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree 
Ring Research were given a $60,000-a-year contract to study fire and climate in 
the groves. The work is being directed by Tom Swetnam, one of the country's top 
tree-ring specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a chain-saw and an old truck, Swetnam has spent the last two summers 
prowling the Sierra, collecting cross-sections from sequoia stumps and downed 
trees, carting tons of wood back to the university's lab in Tucson for 
analysis. From the annual growth rings, Swetnam's staff can tell a tree's age, 
determine when it sprouted and plot it's year-by-year growth. 
</P>
<P>
In good years, when there's plenty of moisture, the rings are wide apart and 
full of growth, in drought years there is less growth and the rings compressed 
tightly together, like lines on a topographical map. Two- and three-year 
periods of drought are not uncommon, the most recent occurring in the mid-1970s 
and again between 1959 and 1961, Swetnam said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Fire 
</P>
<P>
In the years immediately after a big fire that scars a tree, abnormal ring 
growth patterns swirl like storm clouds around the wound, showing how the tree 
tries to heal itself. Many of the big trees have huge fire scars. Some have 
been hollowed by fire and blasted by lightning, but still they have survived. 
</P>
<P>
One cross-section shows a tree had gone through 32 fires between AD 519 and AD 
1297. In the AD 1100-1200 period, the sequoias document a long period of 
drought that gripped much of the West. During wetter times, there were fewer 
fires, but the burns were hotter and more widespread, burning off entire stands 
of smaller pine and fir. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one huge fire in 1297 AD in Mountain Home (State Forest) . . . that 
seems to have killed off all of the understory (smaller pine trees)," Swetnam 
reported. "During the next few years, there was a tremendous growth release in 
the sequoias." 
</P>
<P>
Without the competing smaller trees, the growth rate among the sequoias 
tripled, and new stands sprouted in the burn scar.
