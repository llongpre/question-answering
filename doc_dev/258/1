<TEXT>      ColorStudio 1.5, for Mac LC or II with at least 4MB of RAM and hard disk.
$995. From Letraset GDS Inc., 40 Eisenhower Drive, Paramus, NJ 07653. (800)
343-8973.;   Adobe PhotoShop 2.0, for Mac SE or II with at least 2MB RAM and
hard disk. $895. From Adobe Systems Inc., 1585 Charleston Road, Mountain View,
CA 94039. (415) 961-4400.;   PhotoShop is the absolute standard in image
processing, and Version 2.0 keeps it solidly in that position. With its
plug-in software modules for customization, CMYK editing and popularity, it is
a safe and smart choice. ColorStudio 1.5 weighs in with a similar set of
features, including the ability to use PhotoShop plug-in modules, and adds a
PostScript drawing ability, more complete color calibration, more System 7
support and a customizing language. But it is more expensive and harder to
learn than PhotoShop and doesn't have its huge hold on users and related
products. Publisher's Paintbrush is a Windows alternative to these powerful
Mac programs, lacking some of their sophistication but with plenty of painting
and image-processing power, including direct control of scanners and several
calibration options to match printed results to on-screen colors. (Reviewed

PhotoShop; 3 computers; (hbox);   AceFile, for PCs or compatibles with at
least 2 megabytes RAM and running Windows 3.0 or later. $299 from Ace Software
Corp., 1740 Technology Drive, San Jose, CA 95110. (408) 437-3456.;  
WindowBase, for PCs or compatibles with at least 2 megabytes RAM and running
Windows 3.0 or later. $495 from Software Products International, 9920 Pacific
Heights Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121-4330. (800) 937-4774.;   Superbase 4, for
PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 or later. $695 from Software Publishing
Corp., 3165 Kifer Road, Santa Clara, CA 95051-0804. (408) 986-8000.;   AceFile
is a simple data-base manager for Windows that's easy to install, learn from
the manual and use to browse through and report on dBASE files. It doesn't
offer much network or any SQL abilities and has extremely limited macros for
automating queries. WindowBase and Superbase are powerful relational data
bases for Windows. They pack SQL and networking abilities, customizing
languages and image, text and number storage. Both are confusing to learn,
with too many manual sections, modules and menus. If you need just basic
data-base features under Windows, AceFile is OK, but you'd save money by using
the data-base section of an integrated "Works" package. If you need
connections on a network or to minicomputer data bases, you should consider
WindowBase (with a lower price and a 30-day money-back guarantee) and
Superbase (which is best for storing images), but you should delay any big
decision until you see the imminent Windows versions of Paradox and FoxPro.

4; 2 computers; (hbox); MindLink,  for Macintosh able to run HyperCard
(meaning at least 1 megabyte RAM and a hard disk.) $299. From MindLink Inc.,
Box 247, North Pomfret, VT 05053. (800) 253-1844.;   MindLink uses a variety
of word exercises, suggestions and approaches to help you produce, refine,
collect and report ideas and solutions to problems. Although I was skeptical
of any program that purported to aid creativity, I believe this one truly can.
With a 30-day money-back guarantee, MindLink is worth a try by anyone
comfortable with the Mac. (A Windows version is available for PCs.) (Reviewed
