<TEXT>  ScanMan Model 32 Mac, for Macintosh Plus or later. Hard disk recommended.
$499. From Logitech Inc., 6505 Kaiser Drive, Fremont, CA 94555. (415)
795-8500.;   HotShot ImageBase creates catalogs of graphics files. It displays
or prints them as thumbnails (condensed versions) so you can quickly view and
choose from among large groups of images. It works alongside other programs so
you can keep tabs on and import graphics images while word processing or
desk-top publishing. ScanMan Model 32 for the Mac is a hand scanner. Unlike
the original hand scanners, ScanMan produces scans that are as good as you'll
get from desk-top scanners. It adjusts for your hand-movement variations and
lets you scan large sheets by "stitching" successive scans together. ScanMan
comes with the excellent Digital Darkroom image-editing program and can be
supplemented with Logitech's CatchWord optical character-recognition software
to convert scans into editable word-processor or spreadsheet files. (Reviewed
9/29/91); HotShot ImageBase; 3 computers; ScanMan Model 32 Mac; 4 computers;
(hbox); FoxPro 2.0, for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM. $795. From
Fox Software, 134 W. South Boundary, Perrysburg, OH 43551. (419) 874-0162.;  
FoxPro 2.0 and Paradox are now the leaders in relational data-base management
for the PC. FoxPro has always been known for speed and dBASE compatibility and
was very popular with custom data-base program developers. This new version
will please them, with new debugging tools, an Extended mode version, more
instructions and even more speed. It will also satisfy less knowledgeable
users, with easy QBE (Query By Example) and browse commands, simple tools to
generate screens and menus for user applications and support of SQL and
network operations. FoxPro will certainly become at least the No. 2 data base,
and it has a shot at the top slot. (Reviewed 9/22/91); 3 computers; (hbox);
FrameMaker 3.0, for Macintosh SE or later with at least 2 megabytes of RAM and
hard disk drive. Macintosh II and at least 4 megabytes of RAM recommended.
$795. From Frame Technology Corp., 1010 Rincon Circle, San Jose, CA 95131.
(408) 433-3311.;   FrameMaker offers more power than most personal computer
desk-top publishing programs for creating and editing tables or equations and
for handling long, complex documents. However, that power comes at the price
of a high initial cost, high hardware demands (get 8 megabytes of memory on a
Mac IIfx to be truly comfortable), and a complex interface with lots of menus,
dialogue boxes, and commands to master.(Reviewed 9/15/91); 3 computers;
(hbox); 1-2-3 for Windows, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 or later
with at least 2MB of RAM, 5MB hard disk space and a Windows-compatible
display. $595. From Lotus Development Corp., 55 Cambridge Parkway, Cambridge,
MA 02142. (617) 577-8500.;   1-2-3 for Windows contains all the features of
the best DOS version of 1-2-3 -- Release 3 -- and puts them completely and
smoothly into the Windows world. There you can still use your old 1-2-3 files,
macros and commands or you can use the menus and icons of Windows to
calculate, chart and sort with your spreadsheets. And Lotus even throws in a
free copy of the Adobe Type Manger utility to make your displays and printouts
prettier and easier to read. 1-2-3 for Windows doesn't advance the art of
spreadsheets, but it does finally get Lotus into the world of Windows and does
it while remaining surprisingly compatible with earlier 1-2-3s. For anyone who
has used 1-2-3 before, this is the best spreadsheet for Windows. For those new
to spreadsheets and Windows it is also a fine choice, though it will be in
close competition with Excel and Borland's soon-to-be-released Quattro for
Windows. (Reviewed 9/8/91); 3 computers  </TEXT>
