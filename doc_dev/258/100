   Adobe benefited from continued strong demand for its
printer-software products, which are widely used by
manufacturers of computer printers. The company was also
helped by especially strong sales of its application
products, which make up only one-third of Adobe's total sales
but rose 72% from the year-earlier level.
   Adobe's results were in line with analysts' expectations,
but because of fears about near-term prospects of leading
software companies Adobe's stock fell by $1.25 to $51 a share
in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   In the first six months, net income rose 42% to $25.7
million, or $1.13 a share, from $18 million, or 83 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 51% to $109.7 million
from $72.5 million.
