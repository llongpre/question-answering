<TEXT>     TypeStyler 1.5, for Macintosh Plus, SE, SE30, II or Portable with at least
two disk drives. $199.95. From Broderbund Software, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael,
CA 94903-2101. (415) 492-3200.;    For users who produce graphic designs,
logos, newspapers, magazines and so on, Type Manager 2.0 from Adobe is a must.
It automatically improves the look of characters on screen, especially large
ones. A related Adobe utility, Type Reunion, automatically organizes all the
fonts listed in the Mac's font menu. Adobe's TypeAlign is a desk accessory for
shaping and distorting text, which can work with millions of colors and can
force type to follow any path you draw. It's easy to use but doesn't have many
of the features of the competing TypeStyler from Broderbund. (Reviewed

3.5, for PC, PS/2 or compatible. $91.25. From S&amp;S Enterprises, Weylands Court,
Water Meadow, Germain Street, Chesham, Bucks HP5 1LP, United Kingdom. Phone
0494-791900.;    The Norton AntiVirus, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at
least 384K of RAM and DOS 2.1. $129.95. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave.,
Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 253-9600.;    Virex-PC, for PC, PS/2 or compatible
with at least 512K of RAM and DOS 2.1. $129.95. From Microcom Inc., P.O. Box
51816, Durham, N.C. 27717. (919) 490-1277.;    Virucide, for PC, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 256K RAM and DOS 2.0. $49. From Parsons Technology,
375 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52402. (800) 779-6000.;    Dr. Solomon's
Anti-Virus Toolkit is a bunch of utilities that can detect or analyze certain
virus actions. It is hard to use and is quite slow. Virex-PC finds and
prevents virus infections, but its use is very confusing. The Norton AntiVirus
is the most thorough program for virus eradication and prevention and is
easily installed and used. Norton also provides the best upgrade scheme.
Virucide is the cheapest, is just as fast as Virex or Norton, targets a longer
list of viruses but lacks a prevention feature. (Reviewed 1/27/91); Dr.
Solomon's;    1 computer; The Norton AntiVirus;    4 computers; Virex-PC;    3
computers; Virucide;    4 computers; (hbox); Quattro Pro 2.0, for PC, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk and DOS 2.0 or higher. Charts
require video graphics adapter. $495. Upgrade from Quattro Pro free if you
purchased since July 18; $79.95 if you bought before that; $99.95 upgrade from
competing spreadsheets. From Borland International, 1800 Green Hills Road,
P.O. Box 660001, Scotts Valley, CA 95066-0001. (408) 438-8400.;    Quattro Pro
2.0 adds tight integration to the Paradox 3.5 data-base manager, 3-D chart
types, a drawing feature, a solve-for command and interactive slide show
"hypertext" buttons to the already popular commands, menus and options of
Quattro Pro. Although the technical support isn't as good as it should be,
Quattro Pro 2.0 is easier to use and more graphic than Lotus 1-2-3 and runs on
smaller PCs and is more Lotus-compatible than Excel. (Reviewed 1/20/91); 4
