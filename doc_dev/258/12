<TEXT>     FrameMaker offers more power than most personal computer desk-top
publishing programs for creating and editing tables or equations and for
handling long, complex documents. However, that power comes at the price of a
high initial cost, high hardware demands and a complex interface with lots of
menus, dialogue boxes and commands to master. (Reviewed 9/15/91); 3 computers;
(hbox); 1-2-3 for Windows, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 or later
with at least 2MB of RAM, 5MB hard disk space and a Windows-compatible
display. $595. From Lotus Development Corp., 55 Cambridge Parkway, Cambridge,
MA 02142. (617) 577-8500.;   1-2-3 for Windows contains all the features of
the best DOS version of 1-2-3 -- Release 3 -- and puts them completely and
smoothly into the Windows world. There you can still use your old 1-2-3 files,
macros and commands or you can use the menus and icons of Windows to
calculate, chart and sort with your spreadsheets. 1-2-3 for Windows doesn't
advance the art of spreadsheets, but it does finally get Lotus into the world
of Windows and does it while remaining surprisingly compatible with earlier
1-2-3s. (Reviewed 9/8/91); 3 computers; (hbox); ProWrite Plus, for PC or
compatible running Windows 3.0. $249. From Software Publishing Corp., P.O. Box
7210, 1901 Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94039-7210. (800) 336-8360.;
JustWrite, for IBM PC or compatible running Windows 3.0. $199. From Symantec
Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408) 253-9600.; ProWrite
Plus and JustWrite are inexpensive and unconfusing Windows word processors.
Both are good programs and offer 60-day, money-back guarantees. ProWrite Plus
has more precision for formatting and publishing short documents and has
unique multiple-level undo, E-mail and grammar-checking features but can only
open one document at a time. JustWrite can display only one page of any
document at a time but has more features for handling long documents, can open
more than one document at a time, has built-in outlining and is faster.
(Reviewed 9/1/91); Prowrite; 3 computers; Justwrite; 3 computers; (hbox); Disk
Manager-Mac, for Mac Plus, SE, SE/30, II, LC or Classic with System 5 or later
software. $69.95. From Ontrack Computer Systems, 6321 Bury Drive, Minneapolis,
MN 55346. (800) 752-1333.;    The Norton Desktop for Windows, for PC or
compatible running Windows 3.0 in Standard or Enhanced mode and hard disk.
$149. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408)
253-9600;   Disk Manager Mac lets you inspect, install and partition a single
hard disk into separate areas that can start System 7.0 and System 6 software.
That lets you switch back and forth between the two systems quickly and
easily. The Norton Desktop for Windows is a collection of many useful
utilities organized with a better screen and more commands than you'll find in
standard Windows. It improves Windows a lot at a surprisingly low price.; Disk
