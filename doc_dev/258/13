<TEXT>  Mathcad 3.0, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0. $495. From Mathsoft
Inc., 201 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02139. (617) 577-1017.;    LabVIEW 2, for
any Macintosh with at least 3MB of free hard disk space and 3.5MB of RAM.
$1,995. From National Instruments Corp., 6504 Bridge Point Parkway, Austin, TX
78730-5039. (800) 433-3488 or (512) 794-0100.;    Mathcad 3.0 is an
equation-solving program for PCs running Windows. You type an equation in its
window, and Mathcad pops out the solution, graphs the results and asks for
more. It can handle symbolic equations in algebra and calculus. LabVIEW 2 lets
you build "virtual instruments" and "virtual front panels" on a Mac or PC
screen to collect, analyze, control and present data from laboratory
equipment. Within a few years, this is how all equation solving and instrument
building will be done, except in museums and as practice exercises in
classrooms. (Reviewed 7/28/91);    Mathcad 3.0:; 4 computers;    LabVIEW 2:; 4
computers; Z-486/25E, $8,699. From Zenith Data Systems Inc., 2150 East Lake
Cook Road, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089. (800) 553-0331 or (708) 808-5000.;
Macintosh IIfx, $8,669. From Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani Ave.,
Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;    The Mac IIfx is the fastest Macintosh
Apple makes. The Zenith 486/25E exemplifies the fastest PC you can buy for the
same price from a big-name PC maker. The two machines can be equipped with
identical memory, disk and graphics. When running Windows software, the Zenith
feels about the same speed as the IIfx. However, running DOS software, the
Zenith is faster at the same tasks, though harder to learn than the Mac. When
you're considering Mac vs. PC yourself, compare them running the software you
care about. (Reviewed 7/21/91);    Z-486/25E; 3 computers; Macintosh IIfx; 4
computers; WordPerfect 2.0, for Apple Macintosh Plus or better with hard disk
drive. $495. From WordPerfect Corp., 1555 North Technology Way, Orem, UT
84057. (800) 321-4566.;    WordPerfect 2.0 for the Macintosh is a big
improvement over Version 1.0, and a real challenger to Word and MacWrite. It
still isn't as easy to use as I'd like, but it comes closer in its
organization of commands and options. Although it lacks some features such as
direct import and export of Word files and an integrated outliner, it has an
extensive list of abilities from text styles such as strikeout and redline to
powerful macros, spelling checker and thesaurus, indexing and keyboard
configuring, kerning and columns for desk-top publishing, and even a complete
graphics program built in. (Reviewed 7/14/91);    3 computers; MS-DOS 5, for
PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, 2.8MB free disk space and previous
version of DOS. $99.95 as upgrade from previous MS-DOS version. From Microsoft
Corp., One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. (206) 882-8080.;    DR DOS
5.0, for PC or compatible with at least 256K RAM and 1.2MB of free hard disk
space. $79 as upgrade from previous DR DOS or MS-DOS version, $199.95 as
first-time buy. $19.95 option for Magellan. From Digital Research, Box DRI, 70
Garden Court, Monterey, CA 93942. (408) 649-3896.;    MS-DOS 5 is the best DOS
in years, smaller and more frugal with memory than previous versions of DOS,
easy to install and equipped with a fine text editor, a decent task-switcher,
more command options and an undelete function to recover lost files. However,
DR DOS 5.0 with the Magellan utility option has all of that (except the task
switcher) and more. Both are good programs, and everyone with a PC should
upgrade to one or the other. I prefer DR DOS. (Reviewed 7/7/91);    MS-DOS 5;
3 computers;    DR DOS 5; 4 computers  </TEXT>
