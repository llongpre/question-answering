<LEADPARA>  System 7.0, Apple Computer Inc.'s new computer operating system, manages to be
both simpler and more complex at the same time.;     Scheduled for official
unveiling Monday, the long-promised upgrade to the basic software of the
Macintosh personal computer is Apple's bid to add life to its 7-year-old
mainstay product. The Macintosh's once-unique user interface, which
popularized icons, windows and the "mouse," faces a severe challenge from
products such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows. Apple has put hundreds of
programmers and managers to work on the myriad programs that make up the
system, announced nearly two years ago and being delivered a year behind
schedule.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     System 7.0 -- to be shipped on eight floppy disks -- offers some new
features that have first-timers and experienced users alike buzzing. Apple
promises that System 7.0 will vastly improve many aspects of the Macintosh,
from longstanding complaints about the difficulty in installing type fonts and
"desk accessory" programs, to aiding new users with on-screen help information
in the form of pop-up "balloons.";    The software also boasts advanced
features like "live" linking between data in separate programs, which lets
users change data in a spreadsheet and have it automatically updated in a
separate report. And there's "virtual memory," which can make the computer
behave as if it has hundreds of megabytes of RAM inside.;    Macintosh
partisans believe System 7.0 represents a significant step forward. It is, in
the words of one booster, "what Windows on the PC would like to be in its
wildest fantasies.";    But the changes in System 7.0 represent a
learning-curve challenge to new and veteran users.;    As with any new
software of this complexity, there also are anticipated bugs in the new system
-- although Apple officials say they have spent most of the last six months,
in concert with software beta-testers, hunting down and eliminating them.
There is also a looming issue of incompatibility between System 7.0 and many
existing Macintosh programs. That could add hundreds of dollars in upgrade
fees to the price of System 7.0, expected to be less than $100.;    The result
is that only the intrepid and the brash are expected to dive right into System
7.0.;    "I consider System 7.0 to be the Macintosh consultants' Full
Employment Act," said Howard Hansen, a Seattle-based Macintosh consultant.
"It's going to fix a lot of things, and it's going to break a lot of others.";
   Apple is providing a program that will scan Macintosh owners' existing
programs and flag potentially incompatible ones before System 7.0 is
installed. The program also will list compatible versions -- if there are any
-- and the phone numbers of the publishers, so users can call for upgrades.;  
 Most major applications have been thoroughly tested with System 7.0 and found
to be compatible, including the latest versions of Microsoft Word and Excel,
Aldus PageMaker and FreeHand, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, FileMaker and
MicroPhone.;    Users who have been lax in obtaining the latest versions of
their programs probably will wind up paying for a long list of upgrades.;   
Hansen advises end users to remove all inits -- programs that custom-configure
the Mac upon start-up -- and non-mainstream programs before switching, then
adding and testing them one by one to ensure compatibility.;    "People who
are learning the Macintosh for the first time might as well learn System 7.0
since they'll eventually want to anyway," he says.;    Then, there's the
hardware to consider. A vast number of Macintosh owners -- those with
Macintosh Plus and other models with 1 megabyte of memory or less -- will have
to bump that up to at least 2 megabytes to install System 7.0. A hard disk
with 3 to 5 megabytes of free space also is required, forcing owners of older
floppy disk and even 20-megabyte hard drive models to consider upgrades.;   
In any case, only owners of Macintosh IIci, IIsi or IIfx models can take
advantage of all of System 7.0's features. The Macintosh Plus, Classic, II, LC
or Portable can't use some features at all. Other models like the SE/30, IIx
and IIcx require the addition of a special co-processor chip to use one
feature, "virtual memory." This deficiency has brought protests from many
users, who are pressuring Apple to provide ROM upgrades.;    Whatever
complexities it adds to the once simple and uncluttered Macintosh interface,
System 7.0 is expected to be an eventual must-have.;    Cosmetically, System
7.0 has a few new wrinkles, including greater use of color and a subtle 3-D
look to some icons and buttons. And any installed font can be used throughout
the system -- on file names and other identifiers. Icons can be staggered on
the desk top as well, avoiding the name overlap that has long irritated Mac
users.;    Even those switching to System 7.0 are advised to set aside time to
learn the new features. Among the more prominent:;    (check) "Aliases." For
users who've longed to have a single file stored in more than one place on a
disk or network, Apple has come up with the concept of alias files. They are
essentially small (about 2 kilobytes) "shadow" files linked to a single
original file. Instead of duplicating the information in the original, the
alias file simply contains enough information to "point" to the files they
shadow.;    When you click on an alias, the original file is called up. Any
changes remain intact under the alias and the original. Alias files look like
their originals, except they have italicized names and take up only 1 or 2
kilobytes of space, no matter how big the original. This can save space on the
hard drive -- a large file can be stored on a floppy, for instance. When its
alias is called up, System 7.0 prompts the user to insert the floppy.;   
(check) Publish and subscribe. Also called "live cut and paste," this feature
permits live links of text or graphics (or combinations) between
mother-and-daughter files. When a "published" element is copied to another
file, any changes subsequently made in the original also will be updated in
the copy. If you make the nose bigger on a clown in an illustration file, for
example, the clown's nose also will change in its newsletter layout.;   
(check) Virtual memory. This technique, which originated decades ago with
large computer systems, employs unused portions of a hard disk drive to act
like extra RAM. The computer swaps data it doesn't immediately need from RAM
to disk, freeing up space for data it must have right away. The effect is to
make the computer appear as if it had a gigabyte of memory, not a few
megabytes.;    In reality, the constant swapping to disk, which is much slower
to respond than memory chips, means virtual memory slows down a computer's
operation and should only be used where necessary.;    (check) "Balloon help."
Little cartoon-like dialogue balloons pop up when selected by the mouse
pointer, representing a breakthrough in computer learning aids. An improved
"file find" feature also makes managing and using the contents of a hard disk
easier.;    (check) Font handling is much improved, adopting the traditional
Mac click-and-drag metaphor for installation and removal instead of the clumsy
font/DA mover of the past. The control panel now operates in its own window,
making management of desk accessories much more accessible and sensible. (They
also are available the old way under the Apple menu as well.) And files can be
better organized with a new feature called "labels," as well as moved freely
between windows without having to select an inactive window.;    System 7.0
tips; (box)System 7.0 will be available starting Monday, from dealers and
directly from Apple. The price is expected to be as much as $100 for eight
disks and several manuals.; (box)System 7.0 needs at least 2 megabytes of RAM
and 3 to 5 megabytes of hard disk space. It will run on any Macintosh Plus or
later model with enough RAM and disk, but only the IIsi, IIci and IIfx models
can use all features.; (box)The latest versions of most major Macintosh
applications are compatible with System 7.0; other programs are not. Apple
provides a program to check existing systems for incompatibility problems.;
(box)The automated installation process is short, running 15 minutes or less
on most Macintoshes. That doesn't count the time to install upgrades of
applications software.  </TEXT>
