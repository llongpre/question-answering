(408) 253-9600;   On Target is a project-planning program that takes full
advantage of the Windows environment to make creating, revising and reporting
on a project's tasks, costs and resources easy and intuitive. It doesn't have
sophisticated reporting abilities and is too expensive, but its intelligence
makes it the most exciting software for project management and planning in
some time. PFS:WindowsWorks is an integrated program that has a fine, though
slow, word processor module with some desk-top publishing features. The other
modules are flawed, weak or inconsequential, however, and the notion of adding
another set of desk-top windows, icons and linking features to Windows is
confusing. (Reviewed 8/18/91); PFS:WindowsWorks; 2 computers; On Target; 3
computers; (hbox);       Freelance Graphics for DOS 4.0, for PC or compatible
with at least 640K memory, hard disk, DOS 3.0 or later and graphics display.

(617) 577-8500.; Harvard Graphics 3.0, for PC or compatible with at least 640K
memory, a high-density floppy disk drive, a hard disk and a graphics adapter.
$595. From Software Publishing Corp., P.O. Box 7210, 1901 Landings Drive,
Mountain View, CA 94039-7210. (800) 336-8360.; Hollywood 1.0, for PC or
compatible running Windows 3.0. $495. From IBM Desktop Software, P.O. Box
2150, Atlanta, GA 30301-2150. (800)-IBM-7699.; Not one of these three
presentation graphics programs has all of the features I'd like to see. For
now, Harvard is the simplest to learn and the best if your charts involve lots
of numbers and calculations, but it doesn't show your charts as you make them
and lacks an outliner. Freelance could be the best if you're building charts
from 1-2-3 spreadsheet data or if you also work with OS/2. But Freelance has
limited color abilities and an awkward connection to its spelling checker and
outliner. Hollywood is a Windows program that shines in organizing and
reorganizing sequences of charts. But Hollywood needs more processor and
memory than the others do and does not have the numeric strengths of Harvard
nor the tight 1-2-3 links of Freelance. (Reviewed 8/11/91); Freelance

577-1017.;   LabVIEW 2, for any Macintosh with at least 3MB of free hard disk
space and 3.5MB of RAM. $1,995. From National Instruments Corp., 6504 Bridge
Point Parkway, Austin, TX 78730-5039. (800) 433-3488 or (512) 794-0100.;  
Mathcad 3.0 is an equation-solving program for PCs running Windows. It is easy
to use for anything from elementary-school arithmetic to graduate-level
analysis, statistics and calculus. You type an equation in its window, and
Mathcad pops out the solution, graphs the results and asks for more. LabVIEW 2
lets you build "virtual instruments" and "virtual front panels" on a Mac or PC
screen to collect, analyze, control and present data from laboratory
equipment. It is a programming language where you create instruments and
panels out of picture icons. Within a few years, this is how almost all
equation solving and instrument building will be done. (Reviewed 7/28/91);
