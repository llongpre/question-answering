rated on a scale of one to four, with one computer indicating poor and four
indicating excellent:;   Microsoft Visual Basic, for PC or compatible running
Windows 3.0 in Standard Mode or Enhanced Mode (which means a 286 or higher
processor and at least 1MB of memory, a graphics card, a hard disk and a mouse
or other pointing device). $199. From Microsoft Corp., 1 Microsoft Way,

<TEXT>     Visual Basic is the first programming language of the PC's second decade.
It makes Windows programming relatively easy for everyone from beginners to
overworked corporate professionals, even automating the process of creating
Windows icons, menus and dialog boxes. The PC's real power is its flexibility.
That flexibility comes from software. Visual Basic is a marvelous tool for
creating that software. (Reviewed 8/4/91);    4 computers;  Mathcad 3.0, for
PC or compatible running Windows 3.0. $495. From Mathsoft Inc., 201 Broadway,
Cambridge, MA 02139. (617) 577-1017.;    LabVIEW 2, for any Macintosh with at
least 3MB of free hard disk space and 3.5MB of RAM. $1,995. From National
Instruments Corp., 6504 Bridge Point Parkway, Austin, TX 78730-5039. (800)
433-3488 or (512) 794-0100.;    Mathcad 3.0 is an equation-solving program for
PCs running Windows. It is easy to use for anything from elementary-school
arithmetic to graduate-level analysis, statistics and calculus. You type an
equation in its window, and Mathcad pops out the solution, graphs the results
and asks for more. It can handle symbolic equations in algebra and calculus.
LabVIEW 2 lets you build "virtual instruments" and "virtual front panels" on a
Mac or PC screen to collect, analyze, control and present data from laboratory
equipment. It is a programming language where you create instruments and
panels out of picture icons. Within a few years, this is how all equation
solving and instrument building will be done, except in museums and as
practice exercises in classrooms. (Reviewed 7/28/91);    Mathcad 3.0:; 4
computers;    LabVIEW 2:; 4 computers;  Z-486/25E, $8,699. From Zenith Data
Systems Inc., 2150 East Lake Cook Road, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089. (800)
553-0331 or (708) 808-5000.; Macintosh IIfx, $8,669. From Apple Computer Inc.,
20525 Mariani Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;    The Mac IIfx is
the fastest Macintosh Apple makes. The Zenith 486/25E exemplifies the fastest
PC you can buy for the same price from a big-name PC maker. The two machines
can be equipped with identical memory, disk and graphics. When running Windows
software, the Zenith feels about the same speed as the IIfx. However, running
DOS software, the Zenith is faster at the same tasks, though harder to learn
than the Mac. I don't see a big gap between the fastest PCs and Macs, though
Apple will soon need an even faster Mac to compete with the new 50MHz 486 PCs.
When you're considering Mac vs. PC yourself, compare them running the software
you care about. (Reviewed 7/21/91);    Z-486/25E; 3 computers; Macintosh IIfx;
4 computers;  WordPerfect 2.0, for Apple Macintosh Plus or better with hard
disk drive. $495. From WordPerfect Corp., 1555 North Technology Way, Orem, UT
84057. (800) 321-4566.;    WordPerfect 2.0 for the Macintosh is a big
improvement over Version 1.0, and a real challenger to Word and MacWrite. It
still isn't as easy to use as I'd like, but it comes closer in its
organization of commands and options. Although it lacks some features such as
direct import and export of Word files and an integrated outliner, it has an
extensive list of abilities from text styles such as strikeout and redline to
powerful macros, spelling checker and thesaurus, indexing and keyboard
configuring, kerning and columns for desk-top publishing, and even a complete
graphics program built in. (Reviewed 7/14/91);    3 computers  </TEXT>
