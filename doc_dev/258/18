<TEXT>  Disk Manager-Mac, for Mac Plus, SE, SE/30, II, LC or Classic with System 5 or
later software. $69.95. From Ontrack Computer Systems, 6321 Bury Drive,
Minneapolis, MN 55346. (800) 752-1333.;   The Norton Desktop for Windows, for
PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 in Standard or Enhanced mode and hard
disk. $149. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132.
(408) 253-9600.;   Disk Manager Mac lets you inspect, install and partition
most any Macintosh hard disk. It can partition a single hard disk into
separate areas that can start System 7.0 and System 6 software. That lets you
switch back and forth between the two systems quickly and easily. The Norton
Desktop for Windows is a collection of many useful utilities organized with a
better screen and more commands than you'll find in standard Windows. It makes
Windows both more Mac-like and more able to perform typical DOS functions at a
surprisingly low price. (Reviewed 8/25/91);   Disk Manager-Mac; 3 computers;  
Norton Desktop for Windows; 4 computers; PFS:WindowsWorks, for PC or
compatible running Windows 3.0 in standard or enhanced modes. $199. From
Spinnaker Software Corp., 201 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02139. (617) 494-1200 or
(800) 826-0706.;   On Target, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 in
standard or enhanced modes. $399. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave.,
Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408) 253-9600.;   On Target is a project-planning
program that takes full advantage of the Windows environment to make creating,
revising and reporting on a project's tasks, costs and resources easy and
intuitive. It doesn't have sophisticated reporting abilities and is too
expensive, but its intelligence makes it the most exciting software for
project management and planning in some time. PFS:WindowsWorks is an
integrated program that has a fine, though slow, word processor module with
some desk-top publishing features. The other modules are flawed, weak or
inconsequential, however, and the notion of adding another set of desk-top
windows, icons and linking features to Windows is confusing. (Reviewed
8/18/91);   PFS:WindowsWorks;   2 computers;   On Target;   3 computers;
Freelance Graphics for DOS 4.0, for PC or compatible with at least 640K
memory, hard disk, DOS 3.0 or later and graphics display. $495. From Lotus
Development Corp., 55 Cambridge Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02142. (617) 577-8500.;
Harvard Graphics 3.0, for PC or compatible with at least 640K memory, a
high-density floppy disk drive, a hard disk and a graphics adapter. $595. From
Software Publishing Corp., P.O. Box 7210, 1901 Landings Drive, Mountain View,
CA 94039-7210. (800) 336-8360.; Hollywood 1.0, for PC or compatible running
Windows 3.0. $495. From IBM Desktop Software, P.O. Box 2150, Atlanta, GA
30301-2150. (800)-IBM-7699.; Not one of these three presentation graphics
programs has all of the features I'd like to see. For now, Harvard is the
simplest to learn and the best if your charts involve lots of numbers and
calculations, but it doesn't show your charts as you make them and lacks an
outliner. Freelance could be the best if you're building charts from 1-2-3
spreadsheet data or if you also work with OS/2. But Freelance has limited
color abilities and an awkward connection to its spelling checker and
outliner. Hollywood is a Windows program that shines in organizing and
reorganizing sequences of charts. But Hollywood needs more processor and
memory than the others do and does not have the numeric strengths of Harvard
nor the tight 1-2-3 links of Freelance. (Reviewed 8/11/91);   Freelance
Graphics; 2 computers;   Harvard Graphics 3.0; 2 computers;   Hollywood 1.0; 3
