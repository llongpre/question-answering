<TEXT>     1-2-3 for Windows contains all the features of the best DOS version of
1-2-3 -- Release 3 -- and puts them smoothly into the Windows world. You can
still use your old 1-2-3 files, macros and commands, or you can use the menus
and icons of Windows. For anyone who has used 1-2-3 before, this is the best
spreadsheet for Windows. For those new to spreadsheets and Windows, it is also
a fine choice. (Reviewed 9/8/91);   3 computers; ProWrite Plus, for PC or
compatible running Windows 3.0. $249. From Software Publishing Corp., P.O. Box
7210, 1901 Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94039-7210. (800) 336-8360.;

Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408) 253-9600.; ProWrite
Plus and JustWrite are inexpensive and unconfusing Windows word processors.
Both are good and offer 60-day money-back guarantees. ProWrite Plus has more
precision for formatting and publishing short documents and has unique
multiple-level undo, E-mail and grammar-checking features but can open only
one document at a time. JustWrite can display only one page of any document at
a time but has more features for handling long documents, can open more than
one at a time, has built-in outlining and is faster. (Reviewed 9/1/91);

752-1333.;    The Norton Desktop for Windows, for PC or compatible running

Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408) 253-9600;   Disk
Manager Mac lets you inspect, install and partition most any hard disk. It can
partition a hard disk into areas that can start System 7.0 and System 6
software, letting you switch back and forth easily. The Norton Desktop for
Windows is a collection of useful utilities with a better screen and more
commands than standard Windows. It improves Windows a lot at a low price.;

PFS:WindowsWorks, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 in standard or
enhanced mode. $199. From Spinnaker Software Corp., 201 Broadway, Cambridge,
MA 02139. (617) 494-1200 or (800) 826-0706.;   On Target, for PC or compatible
running Windows 3.0 in standard or enhanced mode. $399. From Symantec Corp.,
10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408) 253-9600;   On Target is a
project-planning program that takes full advantage of Windows to make
creating, revising and reporting on a project's tasks, costs and resources
easy and intuitive. It's too expensive but is the most exciting software in
the field in some time. PFS:WindowsWorks is an integrated program that has a
fine, though slow, word processor with some desk-top publishing features. The
other modules are flawed, weak or inconsequential, and the whole package is
confusing. (Reviewed 8/18/91);   PFS:WindowsWorks;   2 computers;   On Target;
