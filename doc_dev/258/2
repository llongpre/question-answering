<TEXT>     Zenith MastersPort 386SL. $4,499 (with 60MB hard disk). From Zenith Data
Systems, 2150 East Lake Cook Road, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089. (800) 553-0331.;  
H-P 95LX. $699. From Hewlett-Packard Co., 1000 Northeast Circle Blvd.,
Corvallis, OR 97330. (503) 757-2000.;   The Librex 386SX is a small, light
notebook PC with a great keyboard. The Zenith MastersPort 386SL is heavier,
larger and more expensive, with a keyboard I don't like as much but much
longer battery life because of the 386SL chip's power-conservation abilities.
Either could be your main computer, but I prefer the Zenith for its battery
life and instant-on. The H-P 95LX is a pocket-size PC with a miniature
keyboard and a quarter-size screen. It combines 1-2-3 spreadsheet and
financial calculator abilities with address and schedule keeping. It can run
for much longer on its batteries and is much smaller and cheaper than the
other two, but it could not serve as your only computer. (Reviewed 11/24/91);

From ZSoft Corp., 450 Franklin Road, Suite 100, Marietta, GA 30067. (404)
428-0008;   ColorStudio 1.5, for Mac LC or II with at least 4MB of RAM and
hard disk. $995. From Letraset GDS Inc., 40 Eisenhower Drive, Paramus, NJ
07653. (800) 343-8973.;   Adobe PhotoShop 2.0, for Mac SE or II with at least
2MB RAM and hard disk. $895. From Adobe Systems Inc., 1585 Charleston Road,
Mountain View, CA 94039. (415) 961-4400.;   Version 2 keeps PhotoShop the
absolute standard in image processing. With its plug-in software modules for
customization, CMYK editing and popularity, it is a safe and smart choice.
ColorStudio 1.5 weighs in with a similar set of features, including the
ability to use PhotoShop plug-in modules, and adds a PostScript drawing
ability, more complete color calibration, more System 7 support and a
customizing language. But it is more expensive and harder to learn than
PhotoShop. Publisher's Paintbrush is a Windows alternative to these Mac
programs, lacking some of their sophistication but with plenty of painting and
image-processing power, including direct control of scanners and several
calibration options to match printed results to on-screen colors. (Reviewed
11/17/91); Publisher's Paintbrush; 3 computers; ColorStudio; 3 computers;
PhotoShop; 3 computers; (hbox); AceFile, for PCs or compatibles with at least
2 megabytes RAM and running Windows 3.0 or later. $299 from Ace Software
Corp., 1740 Technology Drive, San Jose, CA 95110. (408) 437-3456.;  
WindowBase, for PCs or compatibles with at least 2 megabytes RAM and running
Windows 3.0 or later. $495 from Software Products International, 9920 Pacific
Heights Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121-4330. (800) 937-4774.;   Superbase 4, for
PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 or later. $695 from Software Publishing
Corp., 3165 Kifer Road, Santa Clara, CA 95051-0804. (408) 986-8000.;   AceFile
is a simple data-base manager for Windows that's easy to install, learn and
use. It doesn't offer much network or any SQL abilities. WindowBase and
Superbase are powerful relational data bases for Windows. They pack SQL and
networking abilities, customizing languages and image, text and number
storage. Both are confusing to learn. If you need basic data-base features
under Windows, AceFile is OK, but you'd save money by using the data-base
section of an integrated "Works" package. If you need connections on a network
or to minicomputer data bases, consider WindowBase (with a lower price and a
30-day money-back guarantee) and Superbase (which is best for storing images),
but delay any big decision until you see the imminent Windows versions of
Paradox and FoxPro. (Reviewed 11/10/91); AceFile; 2 computers; WindowBase; 3
