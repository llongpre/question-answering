<LEADPARA>  I'VE NEVER BEEN WILD about type fonts. Next to figuring out why the printer
won't work and fiddling with network hardware, worrying about fonts is my
least favorite computer subject.;    I think many people spend too much time
thinking about which style of type to use in their printed work. For business
reports, memos and letters, it's best to just pick one good font and stick
with it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But there are situations where the form of text is crucial to catching the
reader's eye so the mind will follow.;    Anyone who decides on the position
and appearance of text in a newspaper, book, advertisement or even corporate
annual report is doing far more than just putting words on paper. They are
designing graphics, simultaneously looking for the right spacing, color,
shape, size and feel of the characters. An "a" in one font could be
unobtrusive and prim, an "a" in another font could be bold, confident, in yet
another font just formal and businesslike. The feel of the text shapes will
add to or fight the meaning in the text words.;    The Macintosh is surely the
best computer to use for type manipulations. Because text font, size and style
choices are built into the operating system, they appear in nearly every
program. And the smooth link to laser printers means you can quickly get
printed editions of those text choices.;    But there's plenty more a Mac can
do to type with the right software.;    Adobe, the company that started the
push into sophisticated type software, makes a program (now in its second
generation) that has become standard equipment on almost every Mac I see.
Adobe Type Manager (Adobe, $99, (415) 961-4400), bridges the gap between the
sometimes jagged text put on the screen by the Mac's "QuickDraw" programming,
and the smoother "PostScript" images the LaserWriter prints.;    Once it's
installed, ATM automatically polishes up your characters. Fonts on the screen
-- and printed with an ImageWriter -- are nearly as smooth as LaserWriter
printing. That makes the screen easier to read, a more accurate reflection of
the final printed results, and makes the ImageWriter a better printer. Anyone
who has an ImageWriter should get ATM, and anyone who uses large characters or
much font variety on the Mac should get it, too.;    Adobe's Type Reunion
($65) only does one little thing, but I like that thing. Anyone who works with
a variety of fonts soon has a font menu that stretches way down off the
screen. Scrolling through this menu to find a particular font is tedious. Type
Reunion brings fonts of a similar family together, placing their variations
into pull-out menus beside the main font menu. Different styles of the same
typeface are then found in one place.;    If you use many fonts, you need this
-- though the price is a bit high for such a limited function -- one the Mac
operating system ought to offer, but doesn't.;    Unfortunately, it isn't
compatible with all Mac software. One user I spoke to said it refused to work
with the latest version of QuicKeys, a popular utility.;    If the Mac's
selection of fonts, styles, and sizes can't produce that character look you
want, you need a type manipulation program. You put some text into such a
program and then squeeze, stretch, clip, bend, twist, fatten, and otherwise
play with it. This is irrelevant to word processing, unimportant to many
simple page layout projects, but crucial to creating advertisements and
logos.;    It can also be the route to that perfect leading character or
headline for a magazine, brochure, or newsletter. There are several programs
that handle this work on the Mac.;    Adobe's TypeAlign ($99) is a desk
accessory program, so you can use it alongside any other Macintosh program. It
lets you skew, rotate, and distort text. You just move the handles of the box
surrounding the type, much as you would change the shape of a curve in
Illustrator or of a drawn object in MacDraw.;    TypeAlign offers
MacDraw-style tools for drawing lines and arcs -- it can force type to follow
the path you draw. TypeAlign also offers precise kerning (changing the space
between pairs of characters) to 1/1,000th of an em (a printer's space
measurement) and provides the full 16 million Mac II colors for the type. You
can even give the type a perspective, as if it were in three dimensions.;   
TypeAlign only runs on a system that already has Adobe Type Manager.;   
TypeStyler 1.5 (Broderbund, $199.95, (415) 492-3200) makes TypeAlign look
feeble. It is not a desk accessory but an independent application. TypeStyler
has more features than TypeAlign, but makes them unusually easy to use through
clear graphics and on-screen examples.;    Bending, twisting, distorting,
arching, rotating: all those S&amp;M words of type manipulation are here. And
they're easy to invoke, even for a beginner, because each one is packed into a
very Mac-like menu or window, where you press buttons, turn dials, click on
arrows to make changes.;    TypeStyler, too, can force type along any path you
draw. It also lets you put backdrops behind the type, sports patterns, colors
(though only 256), gradient and radial fills, and kerning and leading. It even
has built in libraries of text shapes and effects.;    There are some flaws,
such as no on-line help, the color limit, and the inability to open several
documents at once. Overall, though, TypeStyler was the program I'd choose for
its easily understood commands and extensive "type twisting" powers.; Type
Manager 2.0, Type Reunion, TypeAlign, for Macintosh Plus, SE, II or Portable
with at least two disk drives. Type Manager 2.0, $99; Type Reunion, $65;
TypeAlign, $99.95. From Adobe Systems, 1585 Charleston Road, P.O. Box 7900,
Mountain View, CA 94039-7900. (415) 961-4400.;    TypeStyler 1.5, for
Macintosh Plus, SE, SE30, II or Portable with at least two disk drives.
$199.95. From Broderbund Software, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903-2101.
(415) 492-3200.; Summary: If you just process words, you don't need to worry
much about fonts. But for those producing graphic designs, logos, newspapers,
magazines and so on, Type Manager 2.0 from Adobe is a must. It automatically
improves the look of characters on screen, especially large ones. A related
Adobe utility, Type Reunion, automatically organizes all the fonts listed in
the Mac's font menu. This can be a godsend, although the price of Reunion is a
little high. Adobe's TypeAlign is a desk accessory for shaping and distorting
text, which can work with millions of colors and can force type to follow any
path you draw. It's relatively easy to use but doesn't have many of the
features of the competing TypeStyler from Broderbund, which includes built-in
libraries of effects, shapes and gradient fills, along with clear commands for
molding text into almost any form.; On a scale of one to four, with one
indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how the products rate:;
