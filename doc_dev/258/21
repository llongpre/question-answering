<TEXT>     System 7.0 is the latest version of the Macintosh's fundamental software.
7.0 looks and acts a lot like the older system software, so anyone with Mac
experience -- and at least 2 megabytes of memory in his or here Mac -- will be
able to use it immediately. 7.0 is even easier to use than the old Mac system
software because of such features as balloon help and a simplified interface.
It offers more power to individuals through TrueType fonts, virtual memory and
publish-and-subscribe features. The immediate drawback is that 7.0 isn't
compatible with all Mac software. For some programs, you'll need to get a new
System 7.0 version. (Reviewed 5/26/91); 4 computers; (hbox); 3-D Charts To Go!
for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible running Windows 3.0. $99.95. From Bloc
Publishing, 800 Douglas Entrance, Executive Tower Penthouse, Coral Gables, FL
33134. (305) 445-0903.;    Org Plus for Macintosh. for Mac Plus, SE or II with
at least two disk drives and System 4.1 or later. MultiFinder compatible.
$195. From Banner Blue, P.O. Box 7865, Fremont, CA 94537. (415) 794-6850.;   
3-D Charts To Go! offers more 3-D bars, pies and ribbons than most other
charting programs and makes it easy to create and style these visually
impressive graphics. If you use Windows and are looking for some spice in your
charting life, the price isn't bad at all. Org Plus for Macintosh only creates
organization charts -- those family trees that show who works for whom. For
many people, these charts are only an occasional duty, so $195 and the time to
learn a new program probably aren't worth the trouble. But if you're
frequently changing org charts, the price will be a trifle. (Reviewed
5/19/91); 3-D Charts To Go!; 4 computers; Org Plus for Macintosh; 3 computers;
(hbox); MenuWorks Advanced and PC-IQ MenuWorks Advanced, for IBM PC, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk drive and DOS 2.0 or later.
$119.95. From PC Dynamics, 31332 Via Colinas No. 102, Westlake Village, CA
91362. (800) 888-1741.;    PC-IQ, for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least
640K RAM, a hard disk drive and DOS 2.0 or later. $99.95. From A.I. Solutions
Inc., 58 Creekview Drive, P.O. Box 128, West Seneca, NY 14224. (800)
677-6670.;    MenuWorks Advanced organizes your programs, DOS commands and its
own utilities (macros, screen saver, text editor, file finder) into menus. It
saves you from memorizing DOS commands but makes you learn its own set of
commands and windows instead. It won't help beginners avoid PC fear. PC-IQ too
has menus for popular programs and DOS commands but adds to them a "natural
language" technology that tries to translate typed English commands into
official DOS-ese commands. You're probably better off just learning those
commands. (Reviewed 5/12/91); MenuWorks Advanced; 3 computers; PC-IQ; 2
computers; (hbox); HyperAccess/5 2.0, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least
340K free memory (which realistically means 512K of RAM), hard disk or
high-capacity (1.2MB) floppy disk drive and either DOS 2.0 or later or OS/2
1.x or later. $99 for DOS version or $199 for both DOS and OS/2 versions. From
Hilgraeve Genesis Centre, 111 Conant Ave., Suite A, Monroe, MI 48161. (313)
243-0576.;    HyperAccess/5 is as easy to use as telecommunications programs
get, which isn't easy enough. It starts with a powerful core that supports all
the latest modems and protocols and adds to that things most telecom programs
don't even approach: remote control of other PCs, a built-in bulletin board
feature, disk and file management, a special high-speed file transfer
protocol, virus protection while on-line. It needs a Windows version and could
be improved with a spelling checker and some more canned log-on scripts but is
definitely my favorite DOS telecom package. (Reviewed 5/5/91); 4 computers  </TEXT>
