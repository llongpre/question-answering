<TEXT>     WindowBase, for PCs or compatibles with at least 2MB RAM and running
Windows 3.0 or later. $495 from Software Products International, 9920 Pacific
Heights Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121-4330. (800) 937-4774.;   Superbase 4, for
PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 or later. $695 from Software Publishing
Corp., 3165 Kifer Road, Santa Clara, CA 95051-0804. (408) 986-8000.;   AceFile
is a simple data-base manager that's easy to install and use to browse through
and report on dBASE files. It doesn't offer much network or any SQL abilities
and has extremely limited macros for automating queries. WindowBase and
Superbase are powerful relational data bases. They pack SQL and networking
abilities, customizing languages and image, text and number storage. Both are
confusing to learn. If you need basic data-base features, AceFile is OK, but
you'd save money by using the data-base section of an integrated "Works"
package. If you need connections on a network or to minicomputer data bases,
consider WindowBase (with a lower price and a 30-day money-back guarantee) and
Superbase (which is best for storing images), but delay any big decision until
you see the imminent Windows versions of Paradox and FoxPro. (Reviewed
11/10/91); AceFile; 2 computers; WindowBase; 3 computers; Superbase 4; 2
computers;    Dynamic Memory Control, for PC or compatible running DOS 2.0 or
later. $79.95. From Adlersparre &amp; Associates Inc., 501-1803 Douglas St.,
Victoria, B.C., Canada V8T 5C3. (604) 384-1118.;   QAPlus, for PC or
compatible. $159.95. From Diagsoft Inc., 5615 Scotts Valley Drive, Suite 140,
Scotts Valley, CA 95066. (408) 438-8247.;   Dynamic Memory Control is a
utility program that makes it easier to load and unload software drivers and
programs from memory. This lets you customize your PC's use of memory. It
works as a complement to memory managers like QEMM and 386MAX. QAPlus is a
diagnostic program that tests a PC's processor, memory, disk drives, keyboard,
ports, video adapter and just about all other parts. Neither program is a
must-have for individuals, who can use less-expensive shareware utilities.
Both could be wonderful for anyone who builds, tests, configures or supports
dozens to thousands of PCs. (Reviewed 11/3/91); Dynamic Memory Control; 3
computers; QAPlus; 3 computers;    MindLink,  for Macintosh able to run
HyperCard (meaning at least 1MB RAM and a hard disk.) $299. From MindLink
Inc., Box 247, North Pomfret, VT 05053. (800) 253-1844.;   MindLink uses a
variety of word exercises, suggestions and approaches to help you produce,
refine, collect and report ideas and solutions to problems. Although I was
skeptical of any program that purported to aid creativity, I believe this one
truly can. With a 30-day money-back guarantee, MindLink is worth a try by
anyone who wants to get out of a mental rut. (A Windows version is available
for PCs.) (Reviewed 10/28/91); 3 computers;   Connections for Macintosh. $199
(or $149 through December from Heizer Software, (800) 888-7667. From
Concentrix Technology Inc., 1875 S. Grant St., Suite 760, San Mateo, CA 94402.
(415) 358-8600.;   Connections is a Personal Information Manager for the
Macintosh. It helps you keep and organize a to-do list, a schedule for
appointments and reminders and a telephone call log. It also keeps a
phone/address directory and any quick notes you want to type. It comes closer
than most PIMs to being a practical replacement for the paper organizer.
However, it is more complex to learn than I would like and demands lots of RAM
(4MB) and processor speed. (Reviewed 10/20/91); 3 computers  </TEXT>
