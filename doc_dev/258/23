<TEXT>     HyperAccess/5 is as easy to use as telecommunications programs get, which
isn't easy enough. It starts with a powerful core that supports all the latest
modems and protocols and adds to that things most telecom programs don't even
approach: remote control of other PCs, a built-in bulletin board feature, disk
and file management, a special high-speed file transfer protocol, virus
protection while on-line. It needs a Windows version and could be improved
with a spelling checker and some more canned log-on scripts but can definitely
claim to be my favorite DOS telecom package. The price for the combined DOS
and OS/2 versions is fantastic. (Reviewed 5/5/91); 4 computers; (hbox); Mobius
One-Page Display/Accelerator for Apple Macintosh SE. $995. $1,195 for two-page
display. From Mobius Technologies, 5835 Doyle St., Emeryville, CA 94608 (800)
669-0556.;    The Mobius One-Page Display/Accelerator is a plug-in card for
the Macintosh SE that attaches to a full-page display. Such displays are vital
for desk-top publishing and useful for most other computing tasks. For about
what most other companies would charge you just for the display, Mobius also
gives you a new processor chip that can run your programs up to six times
faster. It isn't easy to install unless you're familiar and comfortable with
opening up a Macintosh and playing with screwdrivers and cables but is easy to
use. If you have an SE, it's an inexpensive way to catch up with some of what
the latest Macs offer. (Reviewed 4/28/91); 3 computers; (hbox); BatteryWatch
Pro, for IBM PC-compatible lap-tops with hard disk or RAM drive and DOS 3.1 or
later. $49.95. From Traveling Software, 18702 North Creek Parkway, Bothell, WA
98011. (206) 483-8088.;    Laptop UltraVision, for IBM PC-compatible lap-tops
with EGA- or VGA-compatible screen. $69.95. From Personics Inc., 63 Great
Road, Maynard, MA 01754. (800) 445-3311.;    BatteryWatch Pro can monitor the
battery life of your lap-top or notebook computer, to tell you how much time
you've got left before that $4,000 box turns into a lifeless doorstop. This
new version of the program supports more models and has a generic version that
can offer some help to any PC-compatible lap-top. Laptop UltraVision gives you
a larger cursor, more font choices, an option to see more lines on the screen
and color-to-gray-shade conversion choices for any lap-top with an EGA- or
VGA-compatible display. I think both utilities are well worth their prices,
especially for any regular user of a lap-top or notebook computer. (Reviewed
4/21/91); BatteryWatch Pro:; 3 computers; Laptop UltraVision:; 4 computers;
(hbox); KidPix, for Macintosh Plus or later with at least 1 megabyte RAM (for
monochrome) or 2 megabytes for color; a hard disk or two 800K floppy disk
drives; and System 6.0 or later. $49.95 ($119.95 for a School Lab Pack). From
Broderbund Software, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903-2101. (415)
492-3200.;    Kid Pix is a colorful painting program for kids or adults with
lots of strange and fun painting tools (dynamite erasures, electric mixers)
and lots of wacky sounds. For kids, it is the most captivating program I've
seen in years. For adults, it can be a lot of fun and also should be a
reminder that we aren't squeezing enough innovation into most of our programs,
for fun and business. Too many programs are busy piling up features and
porting to Windows but ignoring the vast possibilities for new media, tools
and approaches to computing. (Reviewed 4/14/91); 4 computers  </TEXT>
