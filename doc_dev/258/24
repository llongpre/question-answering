<TEXT>     The PS/2 Model L40 SX is a notebook-sized PC-compatible computer. It has a
large and fast hard disk, a fine keyboard, room for lots of RAM and a large
flat-panel display that can show 32 shades of gray. It also has a good price,
at least for anyone with an IBM corporate or educational discount.
Unfortunately, the display is hard to read, the batteries don't last long
enough, the processor is about to be obsolete, and the whole thing weighs too
much. (Reviewed 6/2/91);    2 computers; (hbox); System 7.0, for Macintoshes
with at least 2 megabytes of RAM and a hard disk drive. A 68030 or equivalent
microprocessor is required to use the virtual memory feature. $99.95. From
Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;
   System 7.0 is the latest version of the Macintosh's fundamental software.
7.0 looks and acts a lot like the older system software, so anyone with Mac
experience -- and at least 2 megabytes of memory in his or her Mac -- will be
able to use it immediately. 7.0 offers balloon help and a simplified
interface. The immediate drawback is that 7.0 isn't compatible with all Mac
software. The reason to look forward to System 8 is that 7.0 doesn't have real
multitasking and loses in some comparisons to personal computers running
Windows or OS/2. (Reviewed 5/26/91);    4 computers; (hbox); 3-D Charts To Go!
for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible running Windows 3.0. $99.95. From Bloc
Publishing, 800 Douglas Entrance, Executive Tower Penthouse, Coral Gables, FL
33134. (305) 445-0903.;    Org Plus for Macintosh. for Mac Plus, SE or II with
at least two disk drives and System 4.1 or later. MultiFinder compatible.
$195. From Banner Blue, P.O. Box 7865, Fremont, CA 94537. (415) 794-6850.;   
Specialized programs sometimes aren't worth buying because you can do most of
what they offer with features in your general-purpose programs. 3-D Charts To
Go! offers more 3-D bars, pies and ribbons than most other charting programs,
though, and makes it easy to create and style these visually impressive
graphics. If you use Windows and are looking for some spice in your charting
life, the price isn't bad at all. Org Plus for Macintosh only creates
organization charts -- those family trees that show who works for whom. For
many people, these charts are only an occasional duty, so $195 and the time to
learn a new program probably aren't worth the trouble. (Reviewed 5/19/91);   
3-D Charts To Go!; 4 computers;    Org Plus for Macintosh; 3 computers;
(hbox); MenuWorks Advanced and PC-IQ MenuWorks Advanced, for IBM PC, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk drive and DOS 2.0 or later.
$119.95. From PC Dynamics, 31332 Via Colinas No. 102, Westlake Village, CA
91362. (800) 888-1741.;    PC-IQ, for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least
640K RAM, a hard disk drive and DOS 2.0 or later. $99.95. From A.I. Solutions
Inc., 58 Creekview Drive, P.O. Box 128, West Seneca, NY 14224. (800)
677-6670.;    MenuWorks Advanced organizes your programs, DOS commands and its
own utilities (macros, screen saver, text editor, file finder) into menus. It
saves you from memorizing DOS commands but makes you learn its own set of
commands and windows instead. It won't help beginners avoid PC fear. PC-IQ too
has menus for popular programs and DOS commands but adds to them a "natural
language" technology that tries to translate typed English commands into
official DOS-ese commands. You're probably better off just learning those
commands. (Reviewed 5/12/91);    MenuWorks Advanced; 3 computers;    PC-IQ; 2
