<TEXT>     Magazine Rack, for PC or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a CD-ROM drive
and DOS 3.1 or higher (with CD-ROM Extensions). 10MHz or faster processor,
color display, mouse and expanded memory recommended. $89.95. From Information
Access Co., 362 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404. (800) 227-8431.;   The
Magazine Rack is a CD-ROM disk packed with the full text of more than 100,000
articles from 300 magazines on business, computers, health and general
interest. All you need to read these articles is a standard PC and a CD-ROM
drive. You search the articles by keywords, authors, subjects or dates and
read the articles on screen or print them. The price is great for a CD-ROM. I
like having this much information at hand, but I wish it included the article
graphics (it has none), that it collected all the important magazines (some
big names are left out), that it came out once a month or at least quarterly
instead of once a year (I only have 1990 articles on the current disk) and
that its software let me read articles while I was using other PC programs
(popping up alongside Lotus or WordPerfect). (Reviewed 10/6/91); 3 computers; 
 HotShot ImageBase, for PC or compatible running DOS 2.1 or later with at
least 512K RAM, a hard disk and a graphics adapter. $149. From SymSoft Corp.,
Call Box 5, Incline Village, NV 89450. (702) 832-4300.; ScanMan Model 32 Mac,
for Macintosh Plus or later. Hard disk recommended. $499. From Logitech Inc.,
6505 Kaiser Drive, Fremont, CA 94555. (415) 795-8500.;   HotShot ImageBase
creates catalogs of graphics files. It displays or prints them as thumbnails
(condensed versions) so you can quickly view and choose from among large
groups of images. It works alongside other programs so you can keep tabs on
and import graphics images while word processing or desk-top publishing.
ScanMan Model 32 for the Mac is a hand-scanner. Unlike the original hand
scanners, ScanMan produces scans that are as good as you'll get from desk-top
scanners. It adjusts for your hand-movement variations and lets you scan large
sheets by "stitching" successive scans together. ScanMan comes with the
excellent Digital Darkroom image-editing program and can be supplemented with
Logitech's CatchWord optical character-recognition software to convert scans
into editable word-processor or spreadsheet files. (Reviewed 9/29/91); HotShot
ImageBase; 3 computers; ScanMan Model 32 Mac; 4 computers;   FoxPro 2.0, for
PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM. $795. From Fox Software, 134 W. South
Boundary, Perrysburg, OH 43551. (419) 874-0162.;   FoxPro 2.0 and Paradox are
now the leaders in relational data-base management for the PC. FoxPro has
always been known for speed and dBASE compatibility and was very popular with
custom data-base program developers. This new version will please them, with
new debugging tools, an Extended mode version, more instructions and even more
speed. It will also satisfy less knowledgeable users, with easy QBE (Query By
Example) and browse commands, simple tools to generate screens and menus for
user applications and support of SQL and network operations. FoxPro will
certainly become at least the No. 2 data base, and it has a shot at the top
slot. (Reviewed 9/22/91); 3 computers;   FrameMaker 3.0, for Macintosh SE or
later with at least 2 megabytes of RAM and hard disk drive. Macintosh II and
at least 4 megabytes of RAM recommended. $795. From Frame Technology Corp.,
1010 Rincon Circle, San Jose, CA 95131. (408) 433-3311.;   FrameMaker offers
more power than most personal computer desk-top publishing programs for
creating and editing tables or equations and for handling long, complex
documents. However, that power comes at the price of a high initial cost, high
hardware demands (get 8 megabytes of memory on a Mac IIfx to be truly
comfortable), and a complex interface with lots of menus, dialogue boxes, and
commands to master.(Reviewed 9/15/91); 3 computers  </TEXT>
