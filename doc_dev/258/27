<TEXT>     Kid Pix is a colorful painting program for kids or adults with lots of
strange and fun painting tools (dynamite erasures, electric mixers) and lots
of wacky sounds. For kids, it is the most captivating program I've seen in
years. For adults, it should be a reminder that we aren't squeezing enough
innovation into most of our programs. (Reviewed 4/14/91);    4 computers;
(hbox); Calendar Creator Plus, for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least
512K RAM, DOS 2.1 or later and a hard disk or two floppy drives. $69.95. From
Power Up Software, 2929 Campus Drive, San Mateo, CA 94403. (415) 345-5900.;
Alarming Events, for Macintosh Plus or later with a hard disk and System 6.0.2
or later. $129.95. From CE Software, P.O. Box 65580, West Des Moines, IA
50265. (515) 224-1995.;    Calendar Creator Plus is a print shop for PC
calendars. You dictate the rules of your calendar, enter events, sort them by
priorities, then view and print the results in any of many different forms and
sizes. It's a good deal if you're in charge of keeping a group's posted
calendar up-to-date. Alarming Events is a scheduler for the Macintosh that not
only lets you enter and view lists of appointments and events but also
actually pops reminders of them up on screen at the proper date and time. Its
price is a bit high and isn't truly adapted to network life but could be
useful if you're constantly in front of a Mac. (Reviewed 4/7/91);    Calendar
Creator Plus; 3 computers;    Alarming Events; 3 computers; (hbox); HyperCard
2.0, for Apple Macintosh Plus or later. Free when bundled with other
companies' HyperCard-based products; $49 upgrade from HyperCard 1.0 includes
stacks, manuals, and support from Claris. From Claris Corp., 5201 Patrick
Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95052-8168. (408) 727-8227) (800) 628-2100.;   
HyperCard 2.0 adds a number of scripting commands and features that will
please those who create programs and interfaces with this popular Macintosh
software. It does not support color, nor does it offer complete compatibility
with HyperCard 1.0, but it does retain the simple use and speed that made
HyperCard famous. (Reviewed 3/31/91);    3 computers; (hbox); Personnel Policy
Expert, for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least 512K RAM and DOS 2.11 or
later. Hard disk recommended. $495. From Knowledgepoint, 1311 Clegg St.,
Petaluma, CA 94954. (800) 727-1133.;    Mind's Eye, for PC or compatible with
at least 512K RAM, a hard disk, an EGA or VGA graphics adapter, and DOS 3.3 or
later. DOS 4, a 386 and 640K RAM recommended. $695. From Mind's Eye Inc., 18
Shangri La Drive, Lexington Park, MD 20653. (800) 622-6746.;    Personnel
Policy Expert helps you create a personnel handbook but does little more than
provide boilerplate text. You're better off going directly to a lawyer. Mind's
Eye attempts to create a new category of software -- computer-aided management
-- by putting the sophisticated abilities of an object-oriented data base
behind a slick interface with "hyperlinks." There may be some impressive power
hidden in the futuristic Mind's Eye, but it isn't useful today. (Reviewed
3/24/91);    Personnel Policy Expert; 2 computers; Mind's Eye; 1 computer  </TEXT>
