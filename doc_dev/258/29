rated on a scale of one to four, with one computer indicating poor and four

<TEXT>  JustWrite, for IBM PC or compatible running Windows 3.0. $199. From Symantec
Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408) 253-9600.; ProWrite
Plus and JustWrite are inexpensive and unconfusing Windows word processors.
Both are good programs and offer 60-day, money-back guarantees. ProWrite Plus
has more precision for formatting and publishing short documents and has
unique multiple-level undo, E-mail and grammar-checking features but can only
open one document at a time. JustWrite can display only one page of any
document at a time but has more features for handling long documents, can open
more than one document at a time, has built-in outlining and is faster.
(Reviewed 9/1/91);   PROWRITE; 3 computers;   JUSTWRITE; 3 computers; Disk
Manager-Mac, for Mac Plus, SE, SE/30, II, LC or Classic with System 5 or later
software. $69.95. From Ontrack Computer Systems, 6321 Bury Drive, Minneapolis,
MN 55346. (800) 752-1333.;   The Norton Desktop for Windows, for PC or
compatible running Windows 3.0 in Standard or Enhanced mode and hard disk.
$149. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408)
253-9600.;   Disk Manager Mac lets you inspect, install and partition most any
Macintosh hard disk. It can partition a single hard disk into separate areas
that can start System 7.0 and System 6 software. That lets you switch back and
forth between the two systems quickly and easily. The Norton Desktop for
Windows is a collection of many useful utilities organized with a better
screen and more commands than you'll find in standard Windows. It improves
Windows a lot -- making it both more Mac-like and more able to perform typical
DOS functions -- at a surprisingly low price.;   Disk Manager-Mac; 3
computers;   Norton Desktop for Windows; 4 computers; PFS:WindowsWorks, for PC
or compatible running Windows 3.0 in standard or enhanced modes. $199. From
Spinnaker Software Corp., 201 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02139. (617) 494-1200 or
(800) 826-0706.;   On Target, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 in
standard or enhanced modes. $399. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave.,
Cupertino, CA 95014-2132. (408) 253-9600.;   On Target is a project-planning
program that takes full advantage of the Windows environment to make creating,
revising and reporting on a project's tasks, costs and resources easy and
intuitive. It doesn't have sophisticated reporting abilities and is too
expensive, but its intelligence makes it the most exciting software for
project management and planning in some time. PFS:WindowsWorks is an
integrated program that has a fine, though slow, word processor module with
some desk-top publishing features. The other modules are flawed, weak or
inconsequential, however, and the notion of adding another set of desk-top
windows, icons and linking features to Windows is confusing. (Reviewed
