<LEADPARA>  IMAGE PROCESSING is the buzzword. Now that computers have the memory to store
gigabytes on disk and megabytes in RAM, the processor power to hum at 25
megahertz and faster and the screens to show a million pixels, they can
graduate from "paint" programs to "image processors." Where once we were
fascinated by creating crude sketches on screen, soon we'll be cropping,
resizing and retouching photographs on screen.;   Professionals are already
doing it. The ad producer who wants Madonna or the latest Ford truck to look
just so in a magazine ad, the animator cobbling together an introductory tape
for a TV broadcast, the artist looking for new media and the scientist
studying patterns in geographic data no longer live and die by the manual
methods of 1960 or even the $100,000 image computers of 1985. Now they often
switch on a PC or Mac.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     While the hardware had to reach a certain level to make desk-top image
processing possible, the software is now the crucial choice. There are a few
general-purpose programs you'll hear more about as image processing becomes a
staple in the computing diet.;   (check) Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0 (ZSoft,
(404) 428-0008, $495) probably will be one of these. It follows in the
footsteps of ZSoft's PC Paintbrush, the most popular paint program for the IBM
Personal Computer and compatibles. It isn't much like Publisher's Paintbrush
1.0 -- I'm not even sure why it has the same name.;   Publisher's 2.0 can work
on black-and-white, 256-shade gray-scale, 256-color or 16.7 million-color
images. That last is important because the eye can see millions of colors. If
you work with fewer, the eye can tell that the image is false.;   Publisher's
starts with the basic painting tools found in every paint package since
MacPaint -- lines, circles, brushes, erasers, text and so on. For text, it
even offers several font types and effects (such as 3-D type). Then there are
more advanced features and commands, such as for filtering to create a mosaic
effect, to remove spots, to sharpen an image. There are also special effects
that can make a picture look embossed or leatherized, and a table for you to
build your own filters. Publisher's can directly read images from optical
scanners and lets you calibrate your scanner input to your screen display and
your printer output.;   This is a great replacement for the very simple paint
program that comes with Windows, a fine graphics file translator and a capable
image processor.;   Because it runs under Windows, you'll probably find it
relatively easy to learn and use, with plenty of help information on hand. I
like it enough that I wrote a book about it ("Using PC Paintbrush IV," M&amp;T
Books, 1991).;   (check) ColorStudio 1.5 (Letraset, (800) 343-8973, $995) is a
major upgrade to a powerful program. It comes with a 90-day money-back
guarantee. The original program had a complete set of painting and drawing
tools and a great depth of image-processing commands. In this new version, you
find more options for the tools that were in place and some important new
tools and commands as well.;   One of the additions is the Shapes Annex, tools
for creating PostScript objects in a separate layer that you can make part of
an image. Drawing directly in PostScript makes for more precise results when
you print but is normally found only in dedicated PostScript drawing programs
like Adobe Illustrator or Aldus Freelance.;   Another addition is a Color
Calibrator to precisely match the printed proofs to what you're doing on
screen. Calibration such as this is becoming vital to image processing and is
a complex undertaking. Along with calibration, you'll find full CMYK editing.
(CMYK is the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black primary colors used in printing. RGB
is the Red, Green and Blue primaries used in displaying. Processing images as
mixtures of RGB on screen and then printing them as mixtures of CMYK sometimes
distorts the result.);   ColorStudio now offers a ColorTalk language for
customizing the program. It also has a "module plug-in" option that will
automatically integrate new filter and effects miniprograms, or "modules."
This means you can buy customizing elements. Letraset took the idea from Adobe
and lets ColorStudio use PhotoShop plug-in modules.;   (check) PhotoShop
(Adobe, (415) 961-4400, $895) is clearly the leader in image processing.;  
Although Publisher's Paintbrush will carve out some territory because it runs
on PCs, most advanced graphics happen on Macs. And although ColorStudio is a
potent challenger, PhotoShop has something like 90 percent of the Mac market.
I find its menus more organized and easier to use than those of ColorStudio,
though in some areas ColorStudio actually offers more commands.;   If you're
looking for related products, the market domination by PhotoShop is obvious.
Bantam publishes "The Official Adobe Photoshop Handbook" by David Biedny and
Bert Monroy if you want a different approach from that in the manual. And you
can find classes in PhotoShop at many computer and publishing centers these
days. There's even an interesting class-in-a-box for PhotoShop, with two audio
cassettes and a couple of tutorial disks from Color Digital Marketing, (408)
358-7793.;   This new version comes bundled with a copy of Adobe Type Manager,
so text in images (and in any other programs) will be smoother on screen and
when printed. PhotoShop doesn't have the PostScript drawing tools of
ColorStudio, though you can import PostScript objects to add to images. Though
creating your own filters isn't easy, certainly not as simple as in
Publisher's Paintbrush or ColorStudio, PhotoShop does permit customization
through the plug-in modules idea. Version 2.0 has CMYK editing and some
calibration abilities. For very advanced work, PhotoShop 2.0 offers special
8-bit channels beyond those necessary for standard image editing, so you can
create unusual effects in images.;   You can't go wrong with PhotoShop, which
is more of a standard than 1-2-3 is in spreadsheets or WordPerfect is in word
processing. However, ColorStudio does have some great abilities and also would
be a good choice. If you're working at the PC, Publisher's Paintbrush is a
fine image editor and a great paint program.; Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0, for
PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 or later and with at least 7.5 megabytes
free disk space. $495. From ZSoft Corp., 450 Franklin Road, Suite 100,
Marietta, GA 30067. (404) 428-0008;    ColorStudio 1.5, for Mac LC or II with
at least 4MB of RAM and hard disk. $995. From Letraset GDS Inc., 40 Eisenhower
Drive, Paramus, NJ 07653. (800) 343-8973.;   Adobe PhotoShop 2.0, for Mac SE
or II with at least 2MB RAM and hard disk. $895. From Adobe Systems Inc., 1585
Charleston Road, Mountain View, CA 94039. (415) 961-4400.; Summary: PhotoShop
is the absolute standard in image processing, and Version 2.0 keeps it solidly
in that position. With its plug-in software modules for customization, CMYK
editing and popularity, it is a safe and smart choice. ColorStudio 1.5 weighs
in with a similar set of features, including the ability to use PhotoShop
plug-in modules, and adds a PostScript drawing ability, more complete color
calibration, more System 7 support and a customizing language. But it is more
expensive and harder to learn than PhotoShop and doesn't have its huge hold on
users and related products. Publisher's Paintbrush is a Windows alternative to
these powerful Mac programs, lacking some of their sophistication but with
plenty of painting and image-processing power, including direct control of
scanners and several calibration options to match printed results to on-screen
colors.; On a scale of one to four, with one indicating poor and four
indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:; Publisher's Paintbrush; 3
