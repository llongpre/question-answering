<TEXT>  Macintosh IIfx, $8,669. From Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani Ave.,
Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;    The Mac IIfx is the fastest Macintosh
Apple makes. The Zenith 486/25E exemplifies the fastest PC you can buy for the
same price from a big-name PC maker. The two machines can be equipped with
identical memory, disk and graphics. When running Windows software, the Zenith
feels about the same speed as the IIfx. However, running DOS software, the
Zenith is faster at the same tasks, though harder to learn than the Mac. I
don't see a big gap between the fastest PCs and Macs, though Apple will soon
need an even faster Mac to compete with the new 50MHz 486 PCs. When you're
considering Mac vs. PC yourself, compare them running the software you care
about. (Reviewed 7/21/91); Z-486/25E; 3 computers; Macintosh IIfx; 4
computers; (hbox); WordPerfect 2.0, for Apple Macintosh Plus or better with
hard disk drive. $495. From WordPerfect Corp., 1555 North Technology Way,
Orem, UT 84057. (800) 321-4566.;    WordPerfect 2.0 for the Macintosh is a big
improvement over Version 1.0, and a real challenger to Word and MacWrite. It
still isn't as easy to use as I'd like, but it comes closer in its
organization of commands and options. Although it lacks some features such as
direct import and export of Word files and an integrated outliner, it has an
extensive list of abilities from text styles such as strikeout and redline to
powerful macros, spelling checker and thesaurus, indexing and keyboard
configuring, kerning and columns for desk-top publishing, and even a complete
graphics program built in. (Reviewed 7/14/91); 3 computers; (hbox); MS-DOS 5,
for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, 2.8MB free disk space and
previous version of DOS. $99.95 as upgrade from previous MS-DOS version. From
Microsoft Corp., One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. (206) 882-8080.;  
  DR DOS 5.0, for PC or compatible with at least 256K RAM and 1.2MB of free
hard disk space. $79 as upgrade from previous DR DOS or MS-DOS version,
$199.95 as first-time buy. $19.95 option for Magellan. From Digital Research,
Box DRI, 70 Garden Court, Monterey, CA 93942. (408) 649-3896.;    MS-DOS 5 is
the best DOS in years, smaller and more frugal with memory than previous
versions of DOS, easy to install and equipped with a fine text editor, a
decent task-switcher, more command options and an undelete function to recover
lost files. However, DR DOS 5.0 with the Magellan utility option has all of
that (except the task switcher) and more. Both are good programs, and everyone
with a PC should upgrade to one or the other. I prefer DR DOS. (Reviewed
7/7/91); MS-DOS 5; 3 computers; DR DOS 5; 4 computers; (hbox); Blaupunkt
Travelpilot, $4,200. From Blaupunkt Bosch Telecom, Robert Bosch Corp., Sales
Group Mobile Communications Division, 2800 South 25th Ave., Broadview, IL
60153. (708) 865-5200.;    Blaupunkt's Travelpilot is a specialized car
computer that tells you where you are. Using wheel sensors, it can detect your
car's direction and speed -- matching that to the grid of streets stored on a
CD-ROM disk. It displays your current position on a 4 1/2-inch screen in the
car and lets you locate paths to any other place on the screen's map. It works
well and easily but is too expensive for individuals. It may be practical
already for delivery, sales and other organizations that can get fleet
discounts and team the Travelpilot with communications services. (Reviewed
