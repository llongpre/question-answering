<TEXT>     Mobius One-Page Display/Accelerator for Apple Macintosh SE. $995. $1,195
for two-page display. From Mobius Technologies, 5835 Doyle St., Emeryville, CA
94608. (800) 669-0556.;    The Mobius One-Page Display/Accelerator is a
plug-in card for the Macintosh SE that attaches to a full-page display. Such
displays are vital for desk-top publishing and useful for most other computing
tasks. For about what most other companies would charge you just for the
display, Mobius also gives you a new processor chip that can run your programs
up to six times faster. It isn't easy to install but is easy to use. It's an
inexpensive way to catch up with some of what the latest Macs offer. (Reviewed
4/28/91); 3 computers; (hbox); BatteryWatch Pro, for IBM PC-compatible
lap-tops with hard disk or RAM drive and DOS 3.1 or later. $49.95. From
Traveling Software, 18702 North Creek Parkway, Bothell, WA 98011. (206)
483-8088.; Laptop UltraVision, for IBM PC-compatible lap-tops with EGA- or
VGA-compatible screen. $69.95. From Personics Inc., 63 Great Road, Maynard, MA
01754. (800) 445-3311.;    BatteryWatch Pro can monitor the battery life of
your lap-top or notebook computer, to tell you how much time you've got left
before that $4,000 box turns into a lifeless doorstop. This new version of the
program supports more models and has a generic version that can offer some
help to any PC-compatible lap-top. Laptop UltraVision gives you a larger
cursor, more font choices, an option to see more lines on the screen and
color-to-gray-shade conversion choices for any lap-top with an EGA- or
VGA-compatible display. Both utilities are worth their prices, especially for
any regular user of a lap-top or notebook computer. (Reviewed 4/21/91);
BatteryWatch Pro:; 3 computers; Laptop UltraVision:; 4 computers; (hbox);
KidPix, for Macintosh Plus or later with at least 1 megabyte RAM (for
monochrome) or 2 megabytes for color; a hard disk or two 800K floppy disk
drives; and System 6.0 or later. $49.95 ($119.95 for a School Lab Pack). From
Broderbund Software, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903-2101. (415)
492-3200.;    Kid Pix is a colorful painting program for kids or adults with
lots of strange and fun painting tools (dynamite erasures, electric mixers)
and lots of wacky sounds. For kids, it is the most captivating program I've
seen in years. For adults, it can be a lot of fun and also should be a
reminder that we aren't squeezing enough innovation into most of our programs,
for fun and business. Too many programs are ignoring the vast possibilities
for new media, tools and approaches to computing. (Reviewed 4/14/91); 4
computers; (hbox); Calendar Creator Plus, for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible with
at least 512K RAM, DOS 2.1 or later and a hard disk or two floppy drives.
$69.95. From Power Up Software, 2929 Campus Drive, San Mateo, CA 94403. (415)
345-5900.; Alarming Events, for Macintosh Plus or later with a hard disk and
System 6.0.2 or later. $129.95. From CE Software, P.O. Box 65580, West Des
Moines, IA 50265. (515) 224-1995.;    Calendar Creator Plus is a print shop
for calendars on the PC. You dictate the rules of your calendar (holidays and
such), enter events, sort them by priorities, then view and print the results
in any of many different forms and sizes (from daily to annual) with graphics
and sharp text fonts and styles. It's a good deal if you're in charge of
keeping a group's posted calendar up-to-date. Alarming Events is a scheduler
for the Macintosh that not only lets you enter and view lists of appointments
and events but also actually pops reminders of them up on screen. Its price is
a bit high and isn't truly adapted to life in a network world but could be
useful if you're constantly in front of a Mac. (Reviewed 4/7/91); Calendar
Creator Plus; 3 computers; Alarming Events; 3 computers  </TEXT>
