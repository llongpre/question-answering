<TEXT>     SatisFAXtion is a "fax modem" board that you can plug into PCs. It lets you
send and receive faxes through the phone line without having a regular fax
machine. You send PC documents -- either created with your programs or scanned
(you need a scanner for this) -- which then appear on a distant fax machine.
You received fax documents -- seeing on screen what someone else fed into a
fax machine, then storing the image on disk or printing it. SatisFAXtion does
a good job of both tasks, has software that's reasonably easy to use and
includes a 2400 bps "data modem," the standard kind for sending documents from
computer to computer. However, SatisFAXtion's price is a bit high; you can buy
fax modems for $140 now. And the 2,400 bps modem is obsolete -- the four-times
faster 9,600 bps modems are now the thing to buy. (Reviewed 3/3/91); 3

Large monitors are necessary equipment for heavy Macintosh desk-top
publishing, CAD or graphics and can be useful for anyone who uses MultiFinder.
They're easy to hook up because of the Mac's operating system, but they are
heavy, expensive and differ widely in software options and ergonomic design.
My favorite full-page display (to show one full 8.5-inch by 11-inch page of
text and graphics) is the Radius Pivot. My favorite two-page displays are the
Sigma Designs L-View and the Radius TPD. (Reviewed 2/24/91); Full-page

computers; (hbox); SideKick 2.0, for IBM PC XT, AT, PS/2 or compatible with at
least 512K RAM, 3 megabytes hard disk space and DOS 2.0 or later. Mouse
recommended. Supports Hayes-compatible modems, popular networks, most printers
and Microsoft Windows. $99.95 ($69.95 for initial period). From Borland
International, 1800 Green Hills Road, PO Box 660001, Scotts Valley, CA
95067-0001. (408) 438-5300.;    SideKick 2.0 is the newest version of the
original utility that gives users several useful functions any time, even when
other programs are running. Version 2.0 adds power to the original note pad,
(spelling checker, thesaurus, margins and formats), to the calculators, and to
the address book. It transforms the simple scheduler into a Time Planner that
can work on a network and can reconcile changed schedules from a portable and
an office-bound PC. It also adds a communications module for simple modem
work, with a surprisingly sophisticated scripting ability. In return, this new
SideKick drops the file management and outlining abilities of SideKick Plus,
wants 3 megabytes of your hard disk and is slower than the original. This is a
good focal point for anyone's computing on a PC and could be a great deal for
anyone having trouble juggling schedules on multiple machines or a network.
