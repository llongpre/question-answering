<LEADPARA>  Here are summaries of some recent Computing product reviews. Each product is
rated on a scale of one to four, with one computer indicating poor and four
indicating excellent:; Seiko Data Directory and PC-Link. $169.95. From Seiko
Instruments USA, 2990 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, CA 90505. (213) 517-7700.; 
  The Data Directory is a pocket-size electronic organizer, sort of halfway
between a calculator and a computer. It has a three-line-by-19-character
display, a QWERTY keyboard (though too small for typing) and runs for hundreds
of hours on batteries. It has a built-in calculator function for simple
arithmetic and can store up to 32 kilobytes worth of memos and phone number
listings. You can search through those memos and lists, protect them with
passwords and use the PC-Link software and cable to move them to and from any
personal computer. The Data Directory is very easy to use but looks feeble
beside some of the admittedly more expensive but complete hand-held organizers
and personal computers of today, such as the Casio BOSS and Sharp Wizard
(organizers) or Atari Portfolio, H-P 95LX and Poqet PC (computers). (Reviewed

<TEXT>  2 computers; (hbox); IBM PS/2 Model L40 SX. $5,995 with 2 megabytes of RAM,
60-megabyte hard disk and external numeric keypad. From International Business
Machines Corp., 1133 Westchester Ave., White Plains, N.Y., 10604. (914)
642-4662.;    The PS/2 Model L40 SX is a notebook-sized PC-compatible
computer. It has a large and fast hard disk, a fine keyboard, room for lots of
RAM, a variety of options and a large flat-panel display that can show 32
shades of gray. It also has a good price, at least for anyone with an IBM
corporate or educational discount. Unfortunately, the display is hard to read,
the batteries don't last long enough, the processor is about to be obsolete
(new machines introduced last month have faster processors or processors that
extend battery life), and the whole thing weighs too much. (Reviewed 6/2/91);
2 computers; (hbox); System 7.0, for Macintoshes with at least 2 megabytes of
RAM and a hard disk drive. A 68030 or equivalent microprocessor is required to
use the virtual memory feature. $99.95. From Apple Computer Inc., 20525
Mariani Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;    System 7.0 is the
latest version of the Macintosh's fundamental software. 7.0 looks and acts a
lot like the older system software, so anyone with Mac experience -- and at
least 2 megabytes of memory in his or here Mac -- will be able to use it
immediately. 7.0 is even easier to use than the old Mac system software
because of such features as balloon help and a simplified interface. It offers
more power to individuals through TrueType fonts, virtual memory and
publish-and-subscribe features. System 7.0 also makes the Mac a more potent
networking machine. The immediate drawback is that 7.0 isn't compatible with
all Mac software. 7.0 doesn't have real multitasking and loses in some
comparisons to personal computers running Windows or OS/2. (Reviewed 5/26/91);
4 computers; (hbox); 3-D Charts To Go! for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible running
Windows 3.0. $99.95. From Bloc Publishing, 800 Douglas Entrance, Executive
Tower Penthouse, Coral Gables, FL 33134. (305) 445-0903.;    Org Plus for
Macintosh. for Mac Plus, SE or II with at least two disk drives and System 4.1
or later. MultiFinder compatible. $195. From Banner Blue, P.O. Box 7865,
Fremont, CA 94537. (415) 794-6850.;    Specialized programs sometimes aren't
worth buying because you can do most of what they offer with features in your
general-purpose programs. 3-D Charts To Go! offers more 3-D bars, pies and
ribbons than most other charting programs, though, and makes it easy to create
and style these visually impressive graphics. If you use Windows and are
looking for some spice in your charting life, the price isn't bad at all. Org
Plus for Macintosh only creates organization charts -- those family trees that
show who works for whom. For many people, these charts are only an occasional
duty, so $195 and the time to learn a new program probably aren't worth the
trouble. But if you're frequently changing org charts, the price will be a
trifle. (Reviewed 5/19/91); 3-D Charts To Go!; 4 computers; Org Plus for
Macintosh; 3 computers  </TEXT>
