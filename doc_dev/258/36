<TEXT>     PC-IQ, for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk
drive and DOS 2.0 or later. $99.95. From A.I. Solutions Inc., 58 Creekview
Drive, P.O. Box 128, West Seneca, NY 14224. (800) 677-6670.;    MenuWorks
Advanced organizes your programs, DOS commands and its own utilities (macros,
screen saver, text editor, file finder) into menus. It saves you from
memorizing DOS commands but makes you learn its own set of commands and
windows instead. It won't help beginners avoid PC fear. PC-IQ too has menus
for popular programs and DOS commands but adds to them a "natural language"
technology that tries to translate typed English commands into official
DOS-ese commands. It does this quickly and powerfully, though somewhat
erratically. You're probably better off just learning the commands. (Reviewed
5/12/91);    MenuWorks Advanced; 3 computers;    PC-IQ; 2 computers; 
HyperAccess/5 2.0, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least 340K free memory
(which realistically means 512K of RAM), hard disk or high-capacity
(1.2-megabyte) floppy disk drive and either DOS 2.0 or later or OS/2 1.x or
later. $99 for DOS version or $199 for both DOS and OS/2 versions. From
Hilgraeve Genesis Centre, 111 Conant Ave., Suite A, Monroe, MI 48161. (313)
243-0576.;    HyperAccess/5 is as easy to use as telecommunications programs
get, which isn't easy enough. It starts with a powerful core that supports all
the latest modems and protocols and adds to that things most telecom programs
don't even approach: remote control of other PCs, a built-in bulletin board
feature, disk and file management, a special high-speed file transfer
protocol, virus protection while on-line. It needs a Windows version and could
be improved with a spelling checker and some more canned log-on scripts but is
my favorite DOS telecom package. The price for the combined DOS and OS/2
versions is fantastic. (Reviewed 5/5/91);    4 computers;  Mobius One-Page
Display/Accelerator for Apple Macintosh SE. $995. $1,195 for two-page display.
From Mobius Technologies, 5835 Doyle St., Emeryville, CA 94608 (800)
669-0556.;    The Mobius One-Page Display/Accelerator is a plug-in card for
the Mac SE that attaches to a full-page display. For about what most other
companies would charge you just for the display, Mobius also gives you a new
processor chip that can run your programs up to six times faster. Not that
easy to install, but easy to use. If you have an SE, it's an inexpensive way
to catch up with some of what the latest Macs offer. (Reviewed 4/28/91);    3
computers;  BatteryWatch Pro, for IBM PC-compatible lap-tops with hard disk or
RAM drive and DOS 3.1 or later. $49.95. From Traveling Software, 18702 North
Creek Parkway, Bothell, WA 98011. (206) 483-8088.;    Laptop UltraVision, for
IBM PC-compatible lap-tops with EGA- or VGA-compatible screen. $69.95. From
Personics Inc., 63 Great Road, Maynard, MA 01754. (800) 445-3311.;   
BatteryWatch Pro can monitor the battery life of your lap-top or notebook
computer to tell you how much time you've got left before that $4,000 box
turns into a doorstop. This new version supports more models and has a generic
version that can offer some help to any PC-compatible lap-top. Laptop
UltraVision gives you a larger cursor, more font choices, an option to see
more lines on the screen and color-to-gray-shade conversion choices for any
lap-top with an EGA- or VGA-compatible display. Both are well worth their
prices. (Reviewed 4/21/91);    BatteryWatch Pro:; 3 computers;    Laptop
