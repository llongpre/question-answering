<LEADPARA>  Here are summaries of some recent Computing product reviews. Each product is
rated on a scale of one to four, with one computer indicating poor and four
indicating excellent:; HyperCard 2.0, for Apple Macintosh Plus or later. Free
when bundled with other companies' HyperCard-based products; $49 upgrade from
HyperCard 1.0 includes stacks, manuals, and support from Claris; $195
Development Package from Claris includes upgrade stacks, manuals, and support
and adds more manuals. From Claris Corp., 5201 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa
Clara, CA 95052-8168. (408) 727-8227) (800) 628-2100.;    HyperCard 2.0 adds a
number of scripting commands and features that will please those who create
programs and interfaces with this popular Macintosh software. It does not
support color, nor does it offer complete compatibility with HyperCard 1.0,
but it does retain the simple use and speed that made HyperCard famous for
presentation and education, multimedia and quick program prototyping.

with at least 512K RAM and DOS 2.11 or later. Hard disk recommended. $495.
From Knowledgepoint, 1311 Clegg St., Petaluma, CA 94954. (800) 727-1133.;   
Mind's Eye, for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk, an EGA
or VGA graphics adapter, and DOS 3.3 or later. DOS 4, a 386 and 640K RAM
recommended. $695. From Mind's Eye Inc., 18 Shangri La Drive, Lexington Park,
MD 20653. (800) 622-6746.;    Personnel Policy Expert helps you create a
personnel handbook for any business. This program does little more than put
the boilerplate text into computer files. Because any result should be checked
by a lawyer anyway, you're better off going directly to a lawyer who
specializes in such matters. Mind's Eye attempts to create a new category of
software -- computer-aided management -- by putting the sophisticated
abilities of an object-oriented data base behind a slick interface with
"hyperlinks" like those in HyperCard or ToolBook. However, it is overloaded
with new terms and backed up by a dense and unclear manual. There may be some
impressive power hidden in the futuristic Mind's Eye, but it isn't useful
today. (Reviewed 3/24/91); Personnel Policy Expert; 2 computers; Mind's Eye; 1
computer; (hbox);    Sharp PC-6220. $2,695. From Sharp Electronics Corp.,
Sharp Plaza, Mahwah, N.J. 07430. (800) 237-4277.;     Tempo LX. $2,999. From
Everex Systems Inc., 48431 Milmont Drive, Fremont, CA 94538. (800) 437-3837.; 
  If you're looking for a portable, look for a notebook computer that weighs 5
to 7 pounds, has a 386SX processor, has at least a 20MB hard disk, has a
floppy drive, contains both full-size screen and keyboard, supports VGA
graphics and costs $3,000 or less. The Everex Tempo LX is a good example,
fulfilling all of these requirements. The Sharp PC 6220 is also a good machine
but has only the 286 processor and so is already falling into obsolescence.
(Reviewed 3/17/91); Sharp PC-6220:; 2 computers;    Tempo:; 3 computers;
(hbox); Inside Information, for Apple Macintosh with at least 1 megabyte RAM,
a hard disk drive and System 6.0 or higher. $119. From Microlytics Inc., 2
Tobey Village Office Park, Pittsford, N.Y. 14534. (716) 248-9150.;    Inside
Information is a dictionary organized by logical subjects rather than by
alphabetical listings, that may help you find definitions or words and
synonyms. Unfortunately many of the definitions are too terse, many words are
left out of the list altogether, and the reverse dictionary isn't smart enough
to find words for many suggested definitions. As a fun data base of
information for browsing, Inside Information could be an expensive educational
toy or a crossword puzzle reference. It is definitely not a practical tool for
writers, business professionals, researchers, students or others. (Reviewed
