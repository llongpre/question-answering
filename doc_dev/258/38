<TEXT>  Intel 9600EX Modem. $799 for the PC version, $819 for the Macintosh version.
From Intel Corp., 5200 N.E. Elam Young Parkway, Hillsboro, OR 97124. (800)
538-3373.;    9,600-bit-per-second modems have become the standard for
business computing. (Recreational computer users can probably get by with a
2,400-bps modem, which costs only $150 or so.) Intel's 9600EX has V.32,
V.32bis, V.42bis and MNP compression support; Hayes command set support;
diagnostic and telecom software; some memory for frequently used numbers; and
protocols and versions for Mac and PC (the cables and software are all that
differs). It also has a five-year warranty and good technical support. It
isn't the cheapest 9,600, though the price isn't bad, nor is it the most
portable -- Microcom's Microportes are only a fraction the size and can run
off batteries. (Reviewed 6/16/91);    3 computers; (hbox); Seiko Data
Directory and PC-Link. $169.95. From Seiko Instruments USA, 2990 West Lomita
Blvd., Torrance, CA 90505. (213) 517-7700.;    The Data Directory is a
pocket-size electronic organizer, sort of halfway between a calculator and a
computer. It has a three-line-by-19-character display, a QWERTY keyboard
(though too small for typing) and runs for hundreds of hours on batteries. It
has a built-in calculator function for simple arithmetic and can store up to
32 kilobytes worth of memos and phone number listings. You can search through
those memos and lists, protect them with passwords and use the PC-Link
software and cable to move them to and from any personal computer. The Data
Directory is very easy to use but looks feeble beside some of the admittedly
more expensive but complete hand-held organizers and personal computers of
today, such as the Casio BOSS and Sharp Wizard (organizers) or Atari
Portfolio, H-P 95LX and Poqet PC (computers). (Reviewed 6/9/91);    2
computers; (hbox); IBM PS/2 Model L40 SX. $5,995 with 2 megabytes of RAM,
60-megabyte hard disk and external numeric keypad. From International Business
Machines Corp., 1133 Westchester Ave., White Plains, N.Y., 10604. (914)
642-4662.;    The PS/2 Model L40 SX is a notebook-sized PC-compatible
computer. It has a large and fast hard disk, a fine keyboard, room for lots of
RAM, a variety of options and a large flat-panel display that can show 32
shades of gray. It also has a good price, at least for anyone with an IBM
corporate or educational discount. Unfortunately, the display is hard to read,
the batteries don't last long enough, the processor is about to be obsolete
(new machines introduced last month have faster processors or processors that
extend battery life), and the whole thing weighs a couple of pounds too much.
(Reviewed 6/2/91);    2 computers; (hbox); System 7.0, for Macintoshes with at
least 2 megabytes of RAM and a hard disk drive. A 68030 or equivalent
microprocessor is required to use the virtual memory feature. $99.95. From
Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;
   System 7.0 is the latest version of the Macintosh's fundamental software.
7.0 looks and acts a lot like the older system software, so anyone with Mac
experience -- and at least 2 megabytes of memory in his or here Mac -- will be
able to use it immediately. 7.0 is even easier to use than the old Mac system
software because of such features as balloon help and a simplified interface.
It offers more power to individuals through TrueType fonts, virtual memory and
publish-and-subscribe features. System 7.0 also makes the Mac a more potent
networking machine. The immediate drawback is that 7.0 isn't compatible with
all Mac software. For some programs, you'll need to get a new System 7.0
version. The reason to look forward to System 8 is that 7.0 doesn't have real
multitasking and loses in some comparisons to personal computers running
Windows or OS/2. (Reviewed 5/26/91);    4 computers  </TEXT>
