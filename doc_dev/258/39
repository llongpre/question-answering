<TEXT>     Alarming Events, for Macintosh Plus or later with a hard disk and System
6.0.2 or later. $129.95. From CE Software, P.O. Box 65580, West Des Moines, IA
50265. (515) 224-1995.;    Calendar Creator Plus is a print shop for calendars
on the PC. You dictate the rules of your calendar (holidays and such), enter
events, sort them by priorities, then view and print the results in any of
many different forms and sizes (from daily to annual) with graphics and sharp
text fonts and styles. It's a good deal if you're in charge of keeping a
group's posted calendar up-to-date. Alarming Events is a scheduler for the
Macintosh that not only lets you enter and view lists of appointments and
events but also actually pops reminders of them up on screen at the proper
date and time. Its price is a bit high and isn't truly adapted to life in a
network world but could be useful if you're constantly in front of a Mac.
(Reviewed 4/7/91); Calendar Creator Plus; 3 computers; Alarming Events; 3
computers; (hbox);    HyperCard 2.0, for Apple Macintosh Plus or later. Free
when bundled with other companies' HyperCard-based products; $49 upgrade from
HyperCard 1.0 includes stacks, manuals, and support from Claris; $195
Development Package from Claris includes upgrade stacks, manuals, and support
and adds more manuals. From Claris Corp., 5201 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa
Clara, CA 95052-8168. (408) 727-8227) (800) 628-2100.;    HyperCard 2.0 adds a
number of scripting commands and features that will please those who create
programs and interfaces with this popular Macintosh software. It does not
support color, nor does it offer complete compatibility with HyperCard 1.0,
but it does retain the simple use and speed that made HyperCard famous for
presentation and education, multimedia and quick program prototyping.
(Reviewed 3/31/91); 3 computers; (hbox); Personnel Policy Expert;    for IBM
PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least 512K RAM and DOS 2.11 or later. Hard disk
recommended. $495. From Knowledgepoint, 1311 Clegg St., Petaluma, CA 94954.
(800) 727-1133.;    Mind's Eye, for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, a
hard disk, an EGA or VGA graphics adapter, and DOS 3.3 or later. DOS 4, a 386
and 640K RAM recommended. $695. From Mind's Eye Inc., 18 Shangri La Drive,
Lexington Park, MD 20653. (800) 622-6746.;    Personnel Policy Expert helps
you create a personnel handbook for any business. This program does little
more than put the boilerplate text into computer files. Because any result
should be checked by a lawyer anyway, you're better off going directly to a
lawyer who specializes in such matters. Mind's Eye attempts to create a new
category of software -- computer-aided management -- by putting the
sophisticated abilities of an object-oriented data base behind a slick
interface with "hyperlinks" like those in HyperCard or ToolBook. However, it
is overloaded with new terms and backed up by a dense manual. The program
crashes easily if you make a wrong move. There may be some impressive power
hidden in the futuristic Mind's Eye, but it isn't useful today. (Reviewed
