<TEXT>     MenuWorks Total Security, for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, a
hard disk and DOS 3.1 or later. $149.95. From PC Dynamics, 31332 Via Colinas
No. 102, Westlake Village, CA 91362. (800) 888-1741.;   LapLink Pro is my
favorite program for transferring files from one PC to another at high speed
over cables or modems. The latest version offers faster transfers and more
automation but doesn't handle Macintosh-to-PC transfers. Last Resort can
remember every key you press while using DOS or DOS applications. That lets
you recover anything you've typed, such as a paragraph typed, then deleted
from a WordPerfect document days before. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for
Windows programs. MenuWorks Total Security adds passwords and file encoding to
the menu building of previous versions. (Reviewed 12/15/91);   LapLink Pro; 3

...; Librex 386SX. $3,599 (with 60 megabyte hard disk). From Librex Computer
Systems Inc., 1731 Technology Drive, Suite 700, San Jose 95110. (408)
441-8500.;   Zenith MastersPort 386SL. $4,499 (with 60MB hard disk). From
Zenith Data Systems, 2150 E. Lake Cook Road, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089. (800)
553-0331.;   H-P 95LX. $699. From Hewlett-Packard Co., 1000 Northeast Circle
Blvd., Corvallis, OR 97330. (503) 757-2000.;   The Librex 386SX is a small,
light notebook PC with a great keyboard. The Zenith MastersPort 386SL is
heavier, larger and more expensive, with a keyboard I don't like as much but
much longer battery life. Either could be your main computer, but I prefer the
Zenith for its battery life and instant-on. The H-P 95LX is a pocket-size PC
with a miniature keyboard and a quarter-size screen. It combines 1-2-3
spreadsheet and financial calculator abilities with address and schedule
keeping. It can run for much longer on its batteries and is much smaller and
cheaper than the other two, but it could not serve as your only computer.

or compatible running Windows 3.0 or later and with at least 7.5 megabytes
free disk space. $495. From ZSoft Corp., 450 Franklin Road, Suite 100,
Marietta, GA 30067. (404) 428-0008;   ColorStudio 1.5, for Mac LC or II with
at least 4MB of RAM and hard disk. $995. From Letraset GDS Inc., 40 Eisenhower
Drive, Paramus, NJ 07653. (800) 343-8973.;   Adobe PhotoShop 2.0, for Mac SE
or II with at least 2MB RAM and hard disk. $895. From Adobe Systems Inc., 1585
Charleston Road, Mountain View, CA 94039. (415) 961-4400.;   PhotoShop is THE
standard in image processing, and Version 2.0 keeps it solidly in that
position. With its plug-in software modules for customization, CMYK editing
and popularity, it is a safe, smart choice. ColorStudio 1.5 has similar
features and adds a PostScript drawing ability, more complete color
calibration, more System 7 support and a customizing language. But it costs
more and is harder to learn. Publisher's Paintbrush, a Windows alternative,
lacks some of the Mac programs' sophistication but has plenty of painting and
image-processing power. (Reviewed 11/17/91); Publisher's Paintbrush; 3
