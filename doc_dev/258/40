Large monitors are necessary equipment for heavy Macintosh desk-top
publishing, CAD or graphics and can be useful for MultiFinder users. They're
easy to hook up, but they are heavy, expensive and differ widely in software
options and ergonomic design. My favorite full-page display (to show one full
8.5-inch by 11-inch page of text and graphics) is the Radius Pivot. My
favorite two-page displays (to show two such pages or to provide more room for
windows and menus) are the Sigma Designs L-View and the Radius TPD. Before you
buy a monitor, though, test it yourself. (Reviewed 2/24/91); Full-page

computers; (hbox);    SideKick 2.0, for IBM PC XT, AT, PS/2 or compatible with
at least 512K RAM, 3 megabytes hard disk space and DOS 2.0 or later. Mouse
recommended. Supports Hayes-compatible modems, popular networks, most printers
and Microsoft Windows. $99.95 ($69.95 for initial period). From Borland
International, 1800 Green Hills Road, PO Box 660001, Scotts Valley, CA
95067-0001. (408) 438-5300.;    SideKick 2.0 is the newest version of the
original utility that gives users several useful functions any time, even when
other programs are running. Version 2.0 adds power to the original note pad,
(spelling checker, thesaurus, margins and formats), to the calculators (more
math functions), and to the address book (room for more details per record,
and pager-messaging). It transforms the simple scheduler into a Time Planner
that can work on a network and can reconcile changed schedules from a portable
and an office-bound PC. It also adds a communications module for simple modem
work. In return, this new SideKick drops the file management and outlining
abilities of SideKick Plus, wants 3 megabytes of your hard disk and is slower
than the original. This is a good focal point for PC users and could be a
great deal for anyone having trouble juggling schedules on multiple machines
or a network. (Reviewed 2/17/91); 4 computers; (hbox); TouchBASE, for any
Macintosh with 1 megabyte of memory, two floppy drives (hard disk highly
recommended), and System 6.0.5 or higher. $125. From After Hours Software,
5636 Van Nuys Blvd., Suite B, Van Nuys, CA 91401. (818) 780-2220.;   
TouchBASE is a computerized address book that installs as a desk accessory on
your Macintosh so it is always on hand even when you run some other program.
TouchBASE lets you easily enter, store, sort, search through and print
reports, fax cover sheets, labels and envelopes from the addresses in the data
base. It is too expensive at the full retail price and can't print a
chronological list of the calls you make from its numbers but has lots of
options for fast and fancy searching. I recommend it, though only if your Mac
has a hard disk. (Reviewed 2/10/91); 3 computers  </TEXT>
