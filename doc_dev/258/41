<LEADPARA>  APPLE'S MACINTOSH Plus and Macintosh SE models are dead, bound to look slow
and small compared with any new computer you see.;    If your needs are
simple, you could continue to use this computer for years, without worrying
about what everyone else is using or changing to.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But more of the new software you'll hear about won't run on your aging
computer. And eventually you'll be faced with trouble getting technical
support for any hardware breakdowns or software confusions you run into. But
if your present hardware is humming along and your software does what you
need, that time could be three or four years into the future. Don't fall for
the computer industry's enthusiasm for replacing your computer every 18 months
or so unless you're loaded with cash and desperate for new computing power.;  
 Even if you decide to catch up with some of the latest computing advances,
you don't necessarily have to buy a new computer. Nearly all personal
computers can be given more memory and storage capacity, and most can be
outfitted with a better display screen and a faster processor.;    For
example, there are about 2 million Macintosh SEs in the world. They weren't
built for easy expansion, offering only a single "slot" for plugging in a new
circuit board of some kind. They're equipped with a small display screen (a
built-in nine-inch diagonal display) and an obsolete processor chip.;    You
could eliminate those troubles by purchasing a new Mac II model, but you'd
easily spend $4,000 or more for it. Instead you could turn to Mobius
Technologies, which has a fountain of youth that will release SEs from the
confines of its tiny screen and will pump up their speed for running programs.
The Mobius One Page Display/Accelerator ($995, (800) 669-0556) may be the last
large investment you need to make in an SE to keep it looking good and running
right up with today's Macs.;    It could add at least a year and perhaps two
to your SE's working life.;    Unless you're a screwdriver and soldering-iron
pro, find a store that sells the Mobius products. Go there with your SE and
have the store personnel install the accelerator and monitor.;    You'll find
that at best the new processor -- the 68030 chip, the latest Apple uses in any
of its Macs -- is from three to six times faster than the old SE processor
chip.;    The improvement depends on the kind of program you run.;    Programs
that rely entirely on the processor chip will get more zip than those that are
more dependent on your disk drive's speed.;    The new 8 1/2-by-11-inch
display will show you a lot more than the old one could. You either can use
its space to make a larger window for one program -- such as showing a full
page of a desk-top publishing document or showing more rows and columns of a
spreadsheet -- or you can use it to show more windows from more programs all
at once. You'll be able to use both displays at once, leaving some things on
your original SE display and putting other things at the same time on the
full-page display. (Mobius also sells the accelerator with a two-page display
for $1,195 if you want yet more room.) The Mac's software makes double-display
systems simple -- you can drag windows from one display to another as if they
were just one large display.;    Acceleration is nice for any computer work,
but it is vital for using larger displays on the Macintosh because the Mac
depends on its main processor chip to figure out what to put up on the screen.
(Many computers have a separate processor for this work.) There are lots more
dots or "pixels" on a larger display, so you need a faster processor to get
them up in the same amount of time. Try running a full-page display from a
Plus or SE without an accelerator, and you'll be waiting seconds for the
screen to catch up to you each time you move a window, edit a line of text or
redraw a graphic image.;    This upgrade, however, doesn't open all the
bottlenecks in the Mac SE. It doesn't help disk performance. However, the
Mobius package does have a trick up its sleeve to improve disk work. The
Mobius board can hold four single in-line memory modules, or SIMMS, of
random-access memory. That means either 4 or 8 megabytes of RAM. The original
logic board in the Mac SE can hold 4 or 8 megabytes, too.;    But the SE can
only recognize 4 megabytes total for holding programs and data and all the
typical tasks of RAM. If you have more than 4 megabytes plugged in, the Mobius
software can turn everything beyond 4 into a "RAM disk." Those RAM chips are
organized and treated as a very fast hard disk. If you copy to it the programs
and files you use most often (and Mobius software can do this automatically
each time you start your Mac), you'll feel as though you have a much faster
hard disk.;    Besides the option of choosing the two-page display, Mobius
also offers two other options for this package. One is the $279 floating-point
processor unit. This is the math co-processor chip, a specialized processor
that handles math much faster than any main processor chip can.;    If you are
crunching lots of numbers in a spreadsheet or data base or if you're using
complicated graphics programs that display 3-D and lots of colors -- or even
desk-top publishing with lots of tricky fonts (these all require math
calculations, too, behind the scenes) -- the FPPU could be worth the money.;  
 For $249, you get the virtual memory option. Virtual memory is a computer
trick to pretend the system has more RAM than it really does. It uses software
to fake that some of the disk memory is actually RAM. Disk memory is big and
cheap. RAM is small and expensive but much faster. Virtual memory leads your
Mac or PC to think it has plenty of RAM to run big programs or many programs,
at the expense of slower processing (because it's actually using disk memory
for part of the RAM). To use it, you need software and hardware that
understand virtual memory.;    This brings to light one of the possible
disadvantages of buying an upgrade such as the Mobius package instead of just
buying a new Mac. Apple won't support virtual memory on such an upgrade. So
although you're prolonging the life of your SE, you're not giving it a whole
new life.;    If you want a faster SE and you need a larger screen, Mobius
offers both at a reasonable price (and a 30-day money-back guarantee). Just
don't install it yourself.;    You might even decide that if you can find a
deal on a used SE and a discount price on the Mobius package, the team would
make a great inexpensive desk-top-publishing system.; Mobius One-Page
Display/Accelerator for Apple Macintosh SE. $995. $1,195 for two-page display.

669-0556.; Summary: The Mobius One-Page Display/Accelerator is a plug-in card
for the Macintosh SE that attaches to a full-page display. Such displays are
vital for desk-top publishing and useful for most other computing tasks. For
about what most other companies would charge you just for the display, Mobius
also gives you a new processor chip that can run your programs up to six times
faster. It isn't easy to install unless you're familiar and comfortable with
opening up a Macintosh and playing with screwdrivers and cables but is easy to
use. If you have an SE, it's an inexpensive way to catch up with some of what
the latest Macs offer.; On a scale of one to four, with one indicating poor
and four indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:; Performance: 4
