<LEADPARA>  A FEW WEEKS back, I casually commented that "there are no data bases for
Windows yet." Boy, did I get calls.;   I could defend myself by saying that
what I meant was that none of the big data-base names had made it to Windows
yet. If you want to run dBASE, Paradox or FoxPro, you'll still have to work in
regular DOS, without the simplifying menus and icons of Windows.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the big names aren't the only actors. I've auditioned a few
challengers: AceFile, WindowBase and Superbase 4.;   AceFile (Ace Software,
$299, (408) 437-3456) is the simplest, least expensive and least powerful of
the bunch.;   That doesn't mean I dislike it. Installation is quick and easy.
The manual is easy to read -- putting tutorial, reference and tips in a single
book. Once it's running, you'll find a data base that can read and write dBASE
III and IV files and that can open up to 10 files at once. As a Windows
program, it can handle dynamic data exchange, or DDE, and clipboard exchange
of information with other Windows software. AceFile can certainly build data
bases large enough -- up to 128 fields and 4,000 characters per record and up
to 2 billion records per data base.;   Creating forms and tables to view
information in AceFile is easy, too. You customize a grid with fonts and
colors just as if you were handling a typical spreadsheet. For analyzing and
querying data-base information, you can make summaries, cross-tabs and other
standard data-base tools as well as use some color 3-D charts.;   You build
AceFile reports graphically on the screen, selecting and placing the
information you want to print from the data base. You also can use the
built-in text editor to create form letters for mail-merge work.;   The quick
up-and-running and easy reporting are AceFile's highlights. The program even
has an auto-dialer feature that would let your modem dial phone numbers found
in a data-base report.;   AceFile fails when asked to handle some more
sophisticated tasks, such as storing graphics, communicating with minicomputer
data bases (through a language such as SQL) and building custom applications.
It has a rudimentary macro ability -- to store and play back sequences of
mouse motions and keystrokes. But it doesn't let you edit those macros and can
only play them back at the same speed, with the same mistakes and hesitations
you used when recording.;   WindowBase (Software Products, $495, (800)
937-4774) is a relational data base that can reach out to other PCs (on a
network) or other computers (through the SQL language).;   Like AceFile,
WindowBase can build huge data bases. It also supports DDE or clipboard
exchange of information with other Windows programs. But it goes way beyond
AceFile in its ability to talk to other data bases running on a network or on
minicomputers or mainframes. It offers full support of the standard SQL
data-base language, with such features as split-screen display for input and
output of SQL. It even tries to let you find information in other data bases
without knowing the SQL language -- you click on dialogue boxes and buttons to
tell what you want, and WindowBase translates that into SQL.;   For creating
forms, WindowBase offers far more tools than AceFile, such as repeating boxes
for list entry, alignment tools for neat layout and scroll bars you can insert
wherever you want them. For reports, it also has up to eight levels of
subtotals for adding up results.;   However, I found WindowBase much harder to
get close to than AceFile. Despite the on-line help, examples and tutorial and
three levels of interface (for beginners, intermediate and advanced users), I
was often confused. The manual has too many sections, each with its own index,
and the menus are sometimes too technical.;   Superbase 4 (Software
Publishing, $695, (408) 986-8000) is the oldest of the three data bases
mentioned here. It used to come from Precision Software, but Software
Publishing bought Precision, joining in last year's scurry to acquire Windows
applications.;   Superbase is, like WindowBase, a relational data base that
can build huge data bases. It, too, lets you graphically create forms and
reports, and like WindowBase can store not only numbers and text but also
images. Superbase can handle up to 24-bit color images, ideal for cataloging
even realistic photographs.;   Superbase supports DDE and clipboard
information exchange and like WindowBase lets you add dynamic link libraries
to extend its abilities.;   Superbase also handles network and SQL links to
other data-base information. It even has a telecommunications feature for
connecting to remote data bases.;   AceFile and WindowBase can read and write
dBASE files. Superbase can not only read and write them, it can also work on
them without reading them in. Along with its data-base language, this means
you can create custom data applications that can work with dBASE applications
instead of entirely replacing them.;   I liked the AceFile menus and manual
much more than those of this more powerful package. Superbase confused me by
separating forms design and reporting from data-base browsing and querying. I
like the VCR-style icon bar for moving within the list of data, though. There
are forward, backward, rewind to beginning, fast forward to end and other such
buttons to click the mouse on. This is an interface that most people will find
comfortable.;   If you need just the basics of a data base under Windows,
AceFile is a good start. But at that price, I think I'd probably just stick to
the data-base part of an integrated Works-style program. If you need SQL,
customizing languages and slick network developments, you'll need to weigh
WindowBase against Superbase. For some uses, such as image data bases,
Superbase looks stronger. But I give WindowBase the edge for most work because
of its lower price and 30-day money-back guarantee. Superbase has a long track
record and one of the largest software companies behind it. The price
difference alone will be negligible compared with customization costs. The
real question is how WindowBase and Superbase will look when compared with the
imminent Paradox for Windows and the eventual FoxPro for Windows.;   Do you
really have to move your data base to Windows now? If you're looking at
serious development work and many PCs for installation, you should probably
wait until the big players arrive. Stick to DOS for now.; AceFile, for PCs or
compatibles with at least 2 megabytes RAM and running Windows 3.0 or later.

986-8000.; Summary: AceFile is a simple data-base manager for Windows that's
easy to install, learn from the manual and use to browse through and report on
dBASE files. It doesn't offer much network or any SQL abilities and has
extremely limited macros for automating queries. WindowBase and Superbase are
powerful relational data bases for Windows. They pack SQL and networking
abilities, customizing languages and image, text and number storage. Both are
confusing to learn, with too many manual sections, modules and menus. If you
need just basic data-base features under Windows, AceFile is OK, but you'd
save money by using the data-base section of an integrated "Works" package. If
you need connections on a network or to minicomputer data bases, you should
consider WindowBase (with a lower price and a 30-day money-back guarantee) and
Superbase (which is best for storing images), but you should delay any big
decision until you see the imminent Windows versions of Paradox and FoxPro.;
On a scale of one to four, with one indicating poor and four indicating
excellent, here's how the product rates:; AceFile: 2 computers; WindowBase: 3
