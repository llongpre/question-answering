<LEADPARA>  Here are summaries of some recent Computing product reviews. Each product is
rated on a scale of one to four, with one computer indicating poor and four
indicating excellent:;  CompuAdd Multimedia 320sc.  $3,195. From CompuAdd,
12303 Technology Blvd., Austin, TX 78727. (800) 627-1967.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The CompuAdd 320sc Multimedia personal computer is one of the first systems
to appear with the new MPC trademark. The 320sc is really just a 386SX-based
PC with an added audio board, a CD-ROM drive and the multimedia extensions to
Windows. The 320sc works well and offers a faster CD-ROM drive than you'll
find in just any MPC, along with free speakers and a microphone. But its price
isn't anything special, and the way its software works (though admittedly just
as the MPC spec calls for) is too awkward. If you must have an MPC now, then
the CompuAdd is a decent choice, but I would wait, until the MPC folks set a
higher standard for ease of use. (Reviewed 10/13/91); ...; 3 computers;
(hbox);  Magazine Rack, for PC or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a CD-ROM
drive and DOS 3.1 or higher (with CD-ROM Extensions). 10MHz or faster
processor, color display, mouse and expanded memory recommended. $89.95. From
Information Access Co., 362 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404. (800)
227-8431.;   The Magazine Rack is a CD-ROM disk packed with the full text of
more than 100,000 articles from 300 magazines on business, computers, health
and general interest. All you need to read these articles is a standard PC and
a CD-ROM drive. The price is great for a CD-ROM. I like having this much
information at hand, but I wish it included the article graphics (it has
none), that it collected all the important magazines (some big names are left
out), that it came out once a month or at least quarterly instead of once a
year and that its software let me read articles while I was using other PC
programs. (Reviewed 10/6/91); 3 computers; ...; (hbox); HotShot ImageBase, for
PC or compatible running DOS 2.1 or later with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk
and a graphics adapter. $149. From SymSoft Corp., Call Box 5, Incline Village,
NV 89450. (702) 832-4300.; ScanMan Model 32 Mac, for Macintosh Plus or later.
Hard disk recommended. $499. From Logitech Inc., 6505 Kaiser Drive, Fremont,
CA 94555. (415) 795-8500.;   HotShot ImageBase creates catalogs of graphics
files. It displays or prints them as thumbnails (condensed versions) so you
can quickly view and choose from among large groups of images. It works
alongside other programs so you can keep tabs on and import graphics images
while word processing or desk-top publishing. ScanMan Model 32 for the Mac is
a hand-scanner. Unlike the original hand scanners, ScanMan produces scans that
are as good as you'll get from desk-top scanners. It adjusts for your
hand-movement variations and lets you scan large sheets by "stitching"
successive scans together. ScanMan comes with the excellent Digital Darkroom
image-editing program and can be supplemented with Logitech's CatchWord
optical character-recognition software to convert scans into editable
word-processor or spreadsheet files. (Reviewed 9/29/91); HotShot ImageBase; 3
computers; ScanMan Model 32 Mac; 4 computers; (hbox); ...; FoxPro 2.0, for PC
or compatible with at least 512K RAM. $795. From Fox Software, 134 W. South
Boundary, Perrysburg, OH 43551. (419) 874-0162.;   FoxPro 2.0 and Paradox are
now the leaders in relational data-base management for the PC. FoxPro has
always been known for speed and dBASE compatibility and was very popular with
custom data-base program developers. This new version will please them, with
new debugging tools, an Extended mode version, more instructions and even more
speed. It will also satisfy less knowledgeable users, with easy QBE (Query By
Example) and browse commands, simple tools to generate screens and menus for
user applications and support of SQL and network operations. FoxPro will
certainly become at least the No. 2 data base, and it has a shot at the top
slot. (Reviewed 9/22/91); 3 computers  </TEXT>
