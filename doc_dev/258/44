<LEADPARA>  Here are summaries of some recent Computing product reviews. Each product is
rated on a scale of one to four, with one computer indicating poor and four
indicating excellent:;    Quattro Pro 2.0, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at

<TEXT>     Quattro Pro 2.0 adds tight integration to the Paradox 3.5 data-base
manager, 3-D chart types, a drawing feature, a solve-for command and
interactive slide show "hypertext" buttons to the already popular commands,
menus and options of Quattro Pro. Although the technical support isn't as good
as it should be, Quattro Pro 2.0 is easier to use and more graphic than Lotus
1-2-3 and runs on smaller PCs and is more Lotus-compatible than Excel (even
operating with Lotus 1-2-3 commands). The upgrade price of $99.95 from any
competing spreadsheet is a great deal. (Reviewed 1/20/91);    4 computers;   
DataClub, for Macintosh Plus or greater in an AppleTalk-compatible network.
$295 for 3 users, $795 for 10 users. From International Business Software,
1270 Oakmead Parkway, Suite 314 Sunnyvale, CA 94086-4034. (408) 522-8000 or
(800) 733-2822.;    Macintosh networks are much easier and cheaper to set up
than Personal Computer networks. But the "dedicated server" Mac networks such
as AppleShare can be expensive because they demand that a dedicated Mac act as
a "file server" system. DataClub runs on the typical Mac network and creates a
"virtual server" by borrowing disk memory from any Mac on the net that has
extra. It makes sharing files very quick and easy but provides several levels
of security to protect private information. Tops used to be the simpler,
cheaper network, but DataClub beats it on expense and setup simplicity.
(Reviewed 1/13/91); 3 computers; (hbox);    Personal R:Base, for PC, XT, AT,
PS/1, PS/2 or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk, running DOS 3.1
or higher. $99 (introductory price until Jan. 31, then $299). From Microrim
Inc., 3925 159th Ave. NE, P.O. Box 97022, Redmond, WA 98073-9722. (206)
649-9500.;    Personal R:Base lacks the programming language and network
features of regular R:Base but does offer pull-down menus, context-sensitive
help, multiple file query and browsing, reporting and form generation
commands, dBASE and Lotus file compatibility, an applications generator and
ready-to-run applications for "personal" stuff such as home finance, mailing
list and appointments organizing, home inventory and even recipe and shopping
list management. And it needs less hardware than most relational data-base
managers do. Especially at the introductory price of $99, it is a great deal
for anyone who needs to work with dBASE files on a lap-top or for anyone who
wants to dip their toes into relational data-base management. However, it is
not easy to learn and is more power than a home user needs. A better name
would be "traveling R:Base." (Reviewed 1/6/91); 3 computers; (hbox);   
Monologue, for PC, XT, AT, PS/1, PS/2 or compatible with at least 384K RAM
running DOS 3.0 or higher. $75 until Jan. 15, then $149. From First Byte,
Clauset Centre, 3100 South Harbor Blvd., Suite 150, Santa Ana, CA 92704. (714)
432-1740.;     PicturePress, for Mac II or SE/30 with System 6.0.4 or higher
and 32-bit QuickDraw. $199. From Storm Technology, 220 California Ave., Suite
101, Palo Alto, CA 94306. (415) 322-0506.;    Monologue is a PC utility that
can read aloud to you any text or numbers on the screen. You can use it to
hear your E-mail, proofread your text documents or speak a spreadsheet to
someone without vision. It is easy to use, lets you choose the pitch and speed
of the voice and supports but doesn't require speech add-on hardware. The big
drawback is that Monologue needs expanded memory to be practical -- adding to
the cost. PicturePress is a graphics file compression utility for the
Macintosh II. It lets you squeeze huge 32-bit color images to 1/2, 1/10 or
even 1/100 of their original size. You balance the quality of the squeezed
image against the amount of compression. For graphics professionals,
PicturePress may soon be standard fare. For infrequent users, a general
compression utility or the compression option built into the latest graphics
program can be enough. (Reviewed 12/30/90); Monologue; 2 computers;
