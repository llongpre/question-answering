<LEADPARA>  THE MACINTOSH user interface of pull-down menus, graphic icons for files and
programs and mouse operations was a big hit with many computer users,
attracting not only buyers but also legions of graphic designers and some of
the most innovative programmers.;    Then came Windows, Microsoft's user
interface that makes the MS-DOS operating system look something like a
Macintosh. Apple had to fight back, and its weapon is System 7.0, the latest
major version of the Macintosh's operating system (Apple Computer Inc.,
$99.95, (408) 996-1010).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although it is more than a year late in arriving and lacks some of the
features that Apple promised it would have, System 7.0 succeeds in improving
that already famous interface and operation of the Macintosh. This is a
program that every Mac owner should consider, although buyers should approach
it with caution because of its demand for 2 megabytes of memory and its
incompatibility with a few programs.;    Besides some changes in the user
interface, there are six major new features in System 7.0.;    A noticeable
one, balloon help, is one more facet of the Mac's "ease of use" claims. When
you point the mouse cursor at any command or window on screen, a tiny
cartoon-style balloon will appear, containing helpful information about the
command or window. This feature, which eventually will find its way into other
Macintosh programs, can be turned off when it's not needed.;    The
file-sharing feature lets other Macintoshes on a network get at information on
your hard disk. You can set up passwords and other security measures to
protect and hide whatever information you want kept private. These network
aspects of System 7.0, which essentially allow you to set up a network without
a separate "file server" computer, are perhaps its most important feature.;   
Publish-and-subscribe is a dynamic version of the cut-and-paste approach to
moving information around in documents. Publish-and-subscribe lets you set up
links between information in different programs. For instance, you could use a
data base to rank the production of your sales people, then write a memo about
the results. If you "publish" the data-base data and "subscribe" to that data
in the word-processor memo, any changes in the data base will automatically
appear in the memo.;    With System 7.0, Apple has brought out its TrueType
font technology that helps put clear, smooth characters on the screen and on
printed pages. In some ways, it is a competitor to PostScript, begun by Apple
when Adobe (the maker of PostScript) wouldn't divulge some of the secrets of
PostScript operation. Now that Adobe has spilled its beans, TrueType's future
isn't so clear, and it is in System 7.0 in only a basic form.;    System 7.0
also includes the "MultiFinder" option that let System 6.0 load more than one
program at a time into memory. That let you move quickly from program to
program without quitting one to start another. But most programs running under
MultiFinder would "freeze" temporarily when you moved to another program, so
the technique isn't as useful as true multitasking, where several programs can
not only share memory but also operate at the same time. System 7.0 claims it
has multitasking, but it isn't changed from the MultiFinder style and so is
less advanced than the true multitasking Windows gives to IBM Personal
Computers.;    System 7.0 also has a new "virtual memory" feature, which, that
on Macs with a 68030 processor chip, can pretend that part of your hard disk
is random-access memory. (Windows does this, too.) This lets you run more
programs and work on larger files, though it is slower than actually buying
more RAM chips.;    Finally, the main interface of System 7.0 is a bit changed
from System 6.0. To any casual user, it looks the same, and you certainly
don't have to learn anything new to use it. But it does allow you to see
multiple levels of directories in a window by clicking on a folder name. It
also lets you add fonts to your system or programs to your Apple menu just by
moving files to the appropriate folder, rather than by using the special
Font/DA Mover program to tack them onto the System file.;    The drawback of
System 7.0, besides needing 2 megabytes of RAM to run (many older Macintoshes
have half that much), is that it isn't friendly to all Mac programs.;   
You'll have to get new versions of some popular programs, such as PageMaker
and MicroPhone, and may never be able to run some lesser-known utilities and
shareware programs if they aren't rewritten to work with System 7.0. Apple
offers a HyperCard program that scans your hard disk and makes a list of
programs it finds that are known not to work perfectly or at all with System
7.0.;    Eventually there will be "System 7.0-savvy" programs that are more
than just compatible with the new operating system. These programs -- such as
the newly announced Claris spreadsheet called Resolve -- will use such new
features as publish-and-subscribe to link data between programs.;    System
7.0 will be free with new Macs starting in August and is also free from user
groups and many electronic bulletin boards. It installs automatically and
easily.;    If you have trouble, you can get technical help directly from
Apple. If you buy the upgrade kit from Apple or a dealer, the assistance is
free for the first 90 days, which is probably all you'll need. For other
users, help is available through a 900 number for $2 a minute. Network
administrators can get help for 180 days, which again is reasonable
considering the additional complexities of networks.;    If you have a Mac
with enough memory and your programs are compatible with System 7.0 (check the
compatibility booklet that comes with the upgrade), you should upgrade
immediately. If some of your software is only partly compatible, wait for new
versions of those programs to appear.;    If you have a network with lots of
Macs and lots of possibly incompatible programs, move carefully. System 7.0
itself probably doesn't have any major bugs, but programs that don't
understand it could. And the biggest reason to get System 7.0 -- the new
generation of System 7.0-savvy programs -- isn't here yet.;    I hope we don't
have to wait three more years for a System 8 with real multitasking and other
improvements. I like having an elegant and powerful alternative to PCs and
DOS.; System 7.0, for Macintoshes with at least 2 megabytes of RAM and a hard
disk drive. A 68030 or equivalent microprocessor is required to use the
virtual memory feature. $99.95. From Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani Ave.,
Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;    Summary: System 7.0 is the latest
version of the Macintosh's fundamental software. 7.0 looks and acts a lot like
the older system software, so anyone with Mac experience -- and at least 2
megabytes of memory in his or here Mac -- will be able to use it immediately.
7.0 is even easier to use than the old Mac system software because of such
features as balloon help and a simplified interface. It offers more power to
individuals through TrueType fonts, virtual memory and publish-and-subscribe
features. System 7.0 also makes the Mac a more potent networking machine. The
immediate drawback is that 7.0 isn't compatible with all Mac software. For
some programs, you'll need to get a new System 7.0 version. The reason to look
forward to System 8 is that 7.0 doesn't have real multitasking and loses in
some comparisons to personal computers running Windows or OS/2.; On a scale of
one to four, with one indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's
how the product rates:;    Performance: 3 computers;    Ease of use: 4
computers;    Value: 4 computers  </TEXT>
