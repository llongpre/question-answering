<TEXT>     Connections is a personal information manager. It helps you keep and
organize a to-do list, a schedule for appointments and reminders, and a
telephone call log. It also keeps a phone/address directory and notes.
Connections can link and sort these lists and share the schedule on a network.
It comes closer than most PIMs to being a practical replacement for the paper
organizer notebook. However, it is more complex to learn than I would like and
demands lots of RAM (4 megabytes) and processor speed to be practical.
(Reviewed 10/20/91); 3 computers; (hbox);    CompuAdd Multimedia 320sc. 
$3,195. From CompuAdd, 12303 Technology Blvd., Austin, TX 78727. (800)
627-1967.;   The CompuAdd 320sc Multimedia personal computer is one of the
first systems to appear with the new MPC trademark. This indicates it meets
the official MPC standard, a minimum of software and hardware abilities for
multimedia. The 320sc is really just a 386SX-based PC with an added audio
board, a CD-ROM drive and the multimedia extensions to Windows. The 320sc
works well and offers a faster CD-ROM drive than you'll find in just any MPC,
along with free speakers and a microphone. But its price is nothing special,
and its software is too awkward. If you must have an MPC now, this is OK, but
I would wait until the MPC folks set a higher standard for ease of use.
(Reviewed 10/13/91); 3 computers; (hbox);    Magazine Rack, for PC or
compatible with at least 640 kilobytes of RAM, a CD-ROM drive and DOS 3.1 or
higher (with CD-ROM Extensions). Ten MHz or faster processor, color display,
mouse and expanded memory recommended. $89.95. From Information Access Co.,
362 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404. (800) 227-8431.;   Magazine Rack is
a CD-ROM disk packed with the full text of more than 100,000 articles from 300
magazines on business, computers, health and general interest. You search the
articles by keywords, authors, subjects or dates and read the articles on
screen or print them. The price is great for a CD-ROM. I like having this much
information at hand, but I wish it included the article graphics, that it
collected all the important magazines, that it came out more often than once a
year, and that its software let me read articles while I was using other PC
programs. (Reviewed 10/6/91); 3 computers; (hbox); HotShot ImageBase, for PC
or compatible running DOS 2.1 or later with at least 512 kilobytes of RAM, a
hard disk and a graphics adapter. $149. From Symsoft Corp., Call Box 5,
Incline Village, NV 89450. (702) 832-4300.; ScanMan Model 32 Mac, for
Macintosh Plus or later. Hard disk recommended. $499. From Logitech Inc., 6505
Kaiser Drive, Fremont, CA 94555. (415) 795-8500.;   HotShot ImageBase creates
catalogs of graphics files. It displays or prints them as thumbnails
(condensed versions) so you can quickly view and choose from among large
groups of images. It works alongside other programs so you can easily import
graphics images. ScanMan Model 32 for the Mac is a hand scanner that gives
results as good as many desk-top scanners. It adjusts for your hand-movement
variations and lets you scan large sheets by "stitching" scans together. It
comes with the excellent Digital Darkroom image-editing program and can be
supplemented with Logitech's CatchWord optical character-recognition software
to convert scans into editable word-processor or spreadsheet files. (Reviewed
