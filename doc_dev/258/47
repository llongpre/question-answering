<TEXT>  DataClub, for Macintosh Plus or greater in an AppleTalk-compatible network.
$295 for 3 users, $795 for 10 users. From International Business Software,
1270 Oakmead Parkway, Suite 314 Sunnyvale, CA 94086-4034. (408) 522-8000 or
(800) 733-2822.;    Macintosh networks are much easier and cheaper to set up
than Personal Computer networks. But the "dedicated server" Mac networks such
as AppleShare can be expensive because they demand that a dedicated Mac act as
a "file server" system. DataClub runs on the typical Mac network and creates a
"virtual server" by borrowing disk memory from any Mac on the net that has
extra. It makes sharing files very quick and easy but provides several levels
of security to protect private information. Tops used to be the simpler,
cheaper network, but DataClub beats it on expense and setup simplicity.
(Reviewed 1/13/91); 3 computers; (hbox); Personal R:Base, for PC, XT, AT,
PS/1, PS/2 or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk, running DOS 3.1
or higher. $99 (introductory price until Jan. 31, then $299). From Microrim
Inc., 3925 159th Ave. NE, P.O. Box 97022, Redmond, WA 98073-9722. (206)
649-9500.;    Personal R:Base lacks the programming language and network
features of regular R:Base but does offer pull-down menus, context-sensitive
help, multiple file query and browsing, reporting and form generation
commands, dBASE and Lotus file compatibility, an applications generator and
ready-to-run applications for "personal" stuff. And it needs less hardware
than most relational data-base managers do. Especially at the introductory
price of $99, it is a great deal for anyone who needs to work with dBASE files
on a lap-top or for anyone who wants to dip their toes into relational
data-base management. However, it is not easy to learn and is more power than
a home user needs. A better name would be "traveling R:Base." (Reviewed
1/6/91); 3 computers; (hbox); Monologue, for PC, XT, AT, PS/1, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 384K RAM running DOS 3.0 or higher. $75 until Jan.
15, then $149. From First Byte, Clauset Centre, 3100 South Harbor Blvd., Suite
150, Santa Ana, CA 92704. (714) 432-1740.;    PicturePress, for Mac II or
SE/30 with System 6.0.4 or higher and 32-bit QuickDraw. $199. From Storm
Technology, 220 California Ave., Suite 101, Palo Alto, CA 94306. (415)
322-0506.;    Monologue is a PC utility that can read aloud to you any text or
numbers on the screen. You can use it to hear your E-mail, proofread your text
documents or speak a spreadsheet to someone without vision. It is easy to use,
lets you choose the pitch and speed of the voice and supports but doesn't
require speech add-on hardware. The big drawback is that Monologue needs
expanded memory to be practical -- adding to the cost. PicturePress is a
graphics file compression utility for the Macintosh II. It lets you squeeze
huge 32-bit color images to 1/2, 1/10 or even 1/100 of their original size.
You balance the quality of the squeezed image against the amount of
compression. For graphics professionals, PicturePress may soon be standard
fare. For infrequent users, a general compression utility or the compression
option built into the latest graphics program can be enough. (Reviewed
12/30/90);    Monologue; 2 computers;    PicturePress; 3 computers; (hbox);
Storyboard Live!, for PC-XT, AT, PS/1, PS/2 or compatible with at least 640K
RAM, a hard disk and an EGA, VGA, 8514/A or compatible graphics adapter. Mouse
recommended. $495. From IBM Desktop Software, Applications Systems Division,
472 Wheelers Farms Road, Milford, CT 06460. (404) 956-4000.;    Storyboard
Live! offers commands for creating or capturing computer graphics, full-motion
and still video and audio, and for laying those multiple media down as
presentations. It could be worth the time and money for someone with a PC who
desperately needs the excitement of multimedia to sell or educate. However,
two of the modules -- screen capture and picture painting -- are weak. Another
-- story presenting -- is merely adequate. The other two -- for creating and
for editing the presentation -- are confusing. The result is a convincing
argument that multimedia is still more an advertising slogan than a practical
PC tool. (Reviewed 12/23/90); 1 computer  </TEXT>
