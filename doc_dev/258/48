<TEXT>     WordPerfect 2.0 for the Macintosh is a big improvement over Version 1.0 and
a real challenger to Word and MacWrite. It still isn't as easy to use as I'd
like, but it comes closer in its organization of commands and options.
Although it lacks some features such as direct import and export of Word files
and an integrated outliner, it has an extensive list of abilities from text
styles such as strikeout and redline to powerful macros, spelling checker and
thesaurus, indexing and keyboard configuring, kerning and columns for desk-top
publishing, and even a complete graphics program built in. (Reviewed 7/14/91);
   3 computers;  MS-DOS 5, for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, 2.8MB
free disk space and previous version of DOS. $99.95 as upgrade from previous
MS-DOS version. From Microsoft Corp., One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA
98052-6399. (206) 882-8080.;    DR DOS 5.0, for PC or compatible with at least
256K RAM and 1.2MB of free hard disk space. $79 as upgrade from previous DR
DOS or MS-DOS version, $199.95 as first-time buy. $19.95 option for Magellan.
From Digital Research, Box DRI, 70 Garden Court, Monterey, CA 93942. (408)
649-3896.;    MS-DOS 5 is the best DOS in years, smaller and more frugal with
memory than previous versions of DOS, easy to install and equipped with a fine
text editor, a decent task-switcher, more command options and an undelete
function to recover lost files. However, DR DOS 5.0 with the Magellan utility
option has all of that (except the task switcher) and more. Both are good
programs, and everyone with a PC should upgrade to one or the other. I prefer
DR DOS. (Reviewed 7/7/91);    MS-DOS 5; 3 computers;    DR DOS 5; 4 computers;
 Blaupunkt Travelpilot, $4,200. From Blaupunkt Bosch Telecom, Robert Bosch
Corp., Sales Group Mobile Communications Division, 2800 South 25th Ave.,
Broadview, IL 60153. (708) 865-5200.;    Blaupunkt's Travelpilot is a
specialized car computer that tells you where you are. Using wheel sensors, it
can detect your car's direction and speed -- matching that to the grid of
streets stored on a CD-ROM disk. It displays your current position on a 4
1/2-inch screen in the car and lets you locate any other place on the screen's
map. It works well and easily but is too expensive for individuals. It may be
practical already for delivery, sales, public safety, field service and other
organizations that can get fleet discounts and can team the Travelpilot with
communications services. (Reviewed 6/30/91);    3 computers;  SuperStor, for
IBM PC or compatible with at least 640 kilobytes of random-access memory and
DOS 3.2 or later. $129. From AddStor Inc., 3905 Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park, CA
94025. (415) 688-0465.;    SuperDisk!, for Apple Macintosh Plus or later with
System 6.0 or System 7.0. $89. From Alysis Software Corp., 1231 31st Ave., San
Francisco, CA 94122. (415) 566-2263.;    "On-the-fly" compression programs can
automatically squeeze program and data files smaller so they'll occupy less
disk space and can be more quickly stored and retrieved. SuperStor is a good
example for PCs and can easily double your PC disk capacity. SuperDisk! does
the same for Macs, though it requires you to explicitly name the files or
folders you want to compress. SuperDisk! makes up for that flaw with another
fine feature -- it can create "auto-expanding" compressed files that any
Macintosh can receive and unsqueeze even without its own copy of SuperDisk!.
