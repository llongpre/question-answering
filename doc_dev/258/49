<TEXT>     PicturePress, for Mac II or SE/30 with System 6.0.4 or higher and 32-bit
QuickDraw. $199. From Storm Technology, 220 California Ave., Suite 101, Palo
Alto, CA 94306. (415) 322-0506.;    Monologue is a PC utility that can read
aloud to you any text or numbers on the screen. You can use it to hear your
E-mail, proofread your text documents or speak a spreadsheet to someone
without vision. It is easy to use, lets you choose the pitch and speed of the
voice and supports but doesn't require speech add-on hardware. The big
drawback is that Monologue needs expanded memory to be practical -- adding to
the cost. PicturePress is a graphics file compression utility for the
Macintosh II. It lets you squeeze huge 32-bit color images to 1/2, 1/10 or
even 1/100 of their original size. You balance the quality of the squeezed
image against the amount of compression. For graphics professionals,
PicturePress may soon be standard fare. For infrequent users, a general
compression utility or the compression option built into the latest graphics
program -- such as Studio/32 -- can be enough. (Reviewed 12/30/90); Monologue;
2 computers; PicturePress; 3 computers; (hbox); Storyboard Live!, for PC-XT,
AT, PS/1, PS/2 or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk and an EGA,
VGA, 8514/A or compatible graphics adapter. Mouse recommended. $495. From IBM
Desktop Software, Applications Systems Division, 472 Wheelers Farms Road,
Milford, CT 06460. (404) 956-4000.;    Storyboard Live! offers commands for
creating or capturing computer graphics, full-motion and still video and
audio, and for laying those multiple media down as presentations. It doesn't
have much multimedia competition yet and could be worth the time and money for
someone with a PC who desperately needs the excitement of multimedia to sell
or educate. However, it is very difficult to use because it divides those
functions into five modules and then infects those modules with a confusing
variety of menus, buttons and icons. Two of the modules -- screen capture and
picture painting -- are weak. Another -- story presenting -- is merely
adequate. The other two -- for creating and for editing the presentation --
are confusing. The result is a convincing argument that multimedia is still
more an advertising slogan than a practical PC tool. (Reviewed 12/23/90); 1
computer; (hbox); FormTool Gold 3.0 and FormFiller 3.0, for IBM PC, XT, AT,
PS/2 or compatible. FormTool Gold needs at least 256K RAM and a printer. A
hard disk and 512K RAM are preferred, and 384K RAM is necessary for some
special features. FormFiller needs 512K RAM, a floppy drive, a hard disk and a
printer. $99.95, FormTool; $149.95, FormFiller. From Bloc Publishing, 800 SW
37th Ave., Suite 765, Coral Gables, FL 33134. (800) 888-2562.;    FormTool
lets you design and print forms from a PC. It is inexpensive and fast and has
a few features you won't find in a word processor. But FormTool is a bit
confusing to learn and could easily be matched by a word processor. FormFiller
lets you create templates for entering information and then printing it on
standard forms. If you have the right printer, it could make filling the same
form over and over a simple and precise task. But it doesn't push the computer
to do what it should -- collecting, storing and tabulating the information
from such forms. (Reviewed 12/16/90); 2 computers  </TEXT>
