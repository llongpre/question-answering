<TEXT>  3-D Charts To Go! for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible running Windows 3.0. $99.95.
From Bloc Publishing, 800 Douglas Entrance, Executive Tower Penthouse, Coral
Gables, FL 33134. (305) 445-0903.;    Org Plus for Macintosh. for Mac Plus, SE
or II with at least two disk drives and System 4.1 or later. MultiFinder
compatible. $195. From Banner Blue, P.O. Box 7865, Fremont, CA 94537. (415)
794-6850.;    Specialized programs sometimes aren't worth buying because you
can do most of what they offer with features in your general-purpose programs.
3-D Charts To Go! offers more 3-D bars, pies and ribbons than most other
charting programs, though, and makes it easy to create and style these
visually impressive graphics. If you use Windows and are looking for some
spice in your charting life, the price isn't bad at all. Org Plus for
Macintosh only creates organization charts -- those family trees that show who
works for whom. For many people, these charts are only an occasional duty, so
$195 and the time to learn a new program probably aren't worth the trouble.
But if you're frequently changing org charts, the price will be a trifle.
(Reviewed 5/19/91);    3-D Charts To Go!; 4 computers;    Org Plus for
Macintosh; 3 computers; (hbox); MenuWorks Advanced and PC-IQ MenuWorks
Advanced, for IBM PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk
drive and DOS 2.0 or later. $119.95. From PC Dynamics, 31332 Via Colinas No.
102, Westlake Village, CA 91362. (800) 888-1741.;    PC-IQ, for IBM PC, PS/2
or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk drive and DOS 2.0 or later.
$99.95. From A.I. Solutions Inc., 58 Creekview Drive, P.O. Box 128, West
Seneca, NY 14224. (800) 677-6670.;    MenuWorks Advanced organizes your
programs, DOS commands and its own utilities (macros, screen saver, text
editor, file finder) into menus. It saves you from memorizing DOS commands but
makes you learn its own set of commands and windows instead. It won't help
beginners avoid PC fear. PC-IQ too has menus for popular programs and DOS
commands but adds to them a "natural language" technology that tries to
translate typed English commands into official DOS-ese commands. It does this
quickly and powerfully, though somewhat erratically. You're probably better
off just learning those commands. (Reviewed 5/12/91);    MenuWorks Advanced; 3
computers;    PC-IQ; 2 computers; (hbox); HyperAccess/5 2.0, for PC, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 340K free memory (which realistically means 512K of
RAM), hard disk or high-capacity (1.2MB) floppy disk drive and either DOS 2.0
or later or OS/2 1.x or later. $99 for DOS version or $199 for both DOS and
OS/2 versions. From Hilgraeve Genesis Centre, 111 Conant Ave., Suite A,
Monroe, MI 48161. (313) 243-0576.;    HyperAccess/5 is as easy to use as
telecommunications programs get, which isn't easy enough. It starts with a
powerful core that supports all the latest modems and protocols and adds to
that things most telecom programs don't even approach: remote control of other
PCs, a built-in bulletin board feature, disk and file management, a special
high-speed file transfer protocol, virus protection while on-line. It needs a
Windows version and could be improved with a spelling checker and some more
canned log-on scripts but can definitely claim to be my favorite DOS telecom
package. The price for the combined DOS and OS/2 versions is fantastic.
(Reviewed 5/5/91);    4 computers; (hbox); Mobius One-Page Display/Accelerator
for Apple Macintosh SE. $995. $1,195 for two-page display. From Mobius
Technologies, 5835 Doyle St., Emeryville, CA 94608 (800) 669-0556.;    The
Mobius One-Page Display/Accelerator is a plug-in card for the Macintosh SE
that attaches to a full-page display. Such displays are vital for desk-top
publishing and useful for most other computing tasks. For about what most
other companies would charge you just for the display, Mobius also gives you a
new processor chip that can run your programs up to six times faster. It isn't
easy to install but is easy to use. If you have an SE, it's an inexpensive way
to catch up with some of what the latest Macs offer. (Reviewed 4/28/91);    3
