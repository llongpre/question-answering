<TEXT>  SuperStor, for IBM PC or compatible with at least 640 kilobytes of
random-access memory and DOS 3.2 or later. $129. From AddStor Inc., 3905
Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025. (415) 688-0465.;    SuperDisk!, for
Apple Macintosh Plus or later with System 6.0 or System 7.0. $89. From Alysis
Software Corp., 1231 31st Ave., San Francisco, CA 94122. (415) 566-2263.;   
"On-the-fly" compression programs can automatically squeeze program and data
files smaller so they'll occupy less disk space and can be more quickly stored
and retrieved. SuperStor is a good example for PCs and can easily double your
disk capacity. SuperDisk! does the same for Macs, though it requires you to
explicitly name the files or folders you want to compress. SuperDisk! makes up
for that flaw with another fine feature -- it can create "auto-expanding"
compressed files that any Macintosh can receive and unsqueeze even without a
copy of SuperDisk!. (Reviewed 6/23/91);    SuperStor; 3 computers; SuperDisk!;
4 computers; (hbox); Intel 9600EX Modem. $799 for the PC version, $819 for the
Macintosh version. From Intel Corp., 5200 N.E. Elam Young Parkway, Hillsboro,
OR 97124. (800) 538-3373.;    9,600-bit-per-second modems have become the
standard for business computing. Intel's 9600EX has V.32, V.32bis, V.42bis and
MNP compression support; Hayes command set support; diagnostic and telecom
software; some memory for frequently used numbers; and protocols and versions
for Mac and PC (the cables and software are all that differs). It also has a
five-year warranty and good technical support. It isn't the cheapest 9,600,
though the price isn't bad, nor is it the most portable -- Microcom's
Microportes are only a fraction the size and can run off batteries. (Reviewed
6/16/91);    3 computers; (hbox); Seiko Data Directory and PC-Link. $169.95.
From Seiko Instruments USA, 2990 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, CA 90505. (213)
517-7700.;    The Data Directory is a pocket-size electronic organizer, sort
of halfway between a calculator and a computer. It has a
three-line-by-19-character display, a QWERTY keyboard (though too small for
typing) and runs for hundreds of hours on batteries. It has a built-in
calculator function for simple arithmetic and can store up to 32 kilobytes
worth of memos and phone number listings. You can search through those memos
and lists, protect them with passwords and use the PC-Link software and cable
to move them to and from any personal computer. The Data Directory is very
easy to use but looks feeble beside some of the admittedly more expensive but
complete hand-held organizers and personal computers of today, such as the
Casio BOSS and Sharp Wizard (organizers) or Atari Portfolio, H-P 95LX and
Poqet PC (computers). (Reviewed 6/9/91);    2 computers; (hbox); IBM PS/2
Model L40 SX. $5,995 with 2 megabytes of RAM, 60-megabyte hard disk and
external numeric keypad. From International Business Machines Corp., 1133
Westchester Ave., White Plains, N.Y., 10604. (914) 642-4662.;    The PS/2
Model L40 SX is a notebook-sized PC-compatible computer. It has a large and
fast hard disk, a fine keyboard, room for lots of RAM, a variety of options
and a large flat-panel display that can show 32 shades of gray. It also has a
good price, at least for anyone with an IBM corporate or educational discount.
Unfortunately, the display is hard to read, the batteries don't last long
enough, the processor is about to be obsolete (new machines introduced last
month have faster processors or processors that extend battery life), and the
whole thing weighs a couple of pounds too much. (Reviewed 6/2/91);    2
