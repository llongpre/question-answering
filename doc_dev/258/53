<TEXT>     QAPlus, for PC or compatible. $159.95. From Diagsoft Inc., 5615 Scotts
Valley Drive, Suite 140, Scotts Valley, CA 95066. (408) 438-8247.;   Dynamic
Memory Control is a utility program that makes it easier to load and unload
software drivers and programs from memory. This lets you customize your PC's
use of memory. It works as a complement to memory managers like QEMM and
386MAX. QAPlus is a diagnostic program that tests a PC's processor, memory,
disk drives, keyboard, ports, video adapter and just about all other parts.
Neither is a must-have for individuals, but both could be great for anyone who
builds, tests, configures or supports dozens, hundreds or thousands of PCs.
(Reviewed 11/3/91); Dynamic Memory Control; 3 computers; QAPlus; 3 computers;
(hbox); MindLink,  for Macintosh able to run HyperCard (meaning at least 1
megabyte RAM and a hard disk.) $299. From MindLink Inc., Box 247, North
Pomfret, VT 05053. (800) 253-1844.;   MindLink uses a variety of word
exercises, suggestions and approaches to help you produce, refine, collect and
report ideas and solutions to problems. With a 30-day money-back guarantee,
MindLink is worth a try by anyone who wants to get out of a mental rut. The
only drawback is that you may need to spend a few hours before you're
comfortable with it. (A Windows version is available for PCs.) (Reviewed
10/28/91); 3 computers; (hbox); Connections for Macintosh. $199 (or $149
through December from Heizer Software, (800) 888-7667. From Concentrix
Technology Inc., 1875 S. Grant St., Suite 760, San Mateo, CA 94402. (415)
358-8600.;   Connections is a personal information manager. It helps you keep
and organize a to-do list, a schedule for appointments and reminders, and a
telephone call log. It also keeps a phone/address directory and notes.
Connections can link and sort these lists and can even share the schedule with
others on a network. It automates many aspects of personal information
handling and comes closer than most PIMs to being a practical replacement for
the paper organizer notebook. However, it is more complex to learn than I
would like and demands lots of RAM (4 megabytes) and processor speed.
(Reviewed 10/20/91); 3 computers; (hbox); CompuAdd Multimedia 320sc.  $3,195.
From CompuAdd, 12303 Technology Blvd., Austin, TX 78727. (800) 627-1967.;  
The CompuAdd 320sc Multimedia personal computer is one of the first systems to
bear the new MPC trademark, indicating it meets at least the minimum software
and hardware standards for multimedia. The 320sc is really just a 386SX-based
PC with an added audio board, a CD-ROM drive and the multimedia extensions to
Windows. The 320sc works well and offers a faster CD-ROM drive than you'll
find in just any MPC, along with free speakers and a microphone. But its price
isn't anything special, and its software is too awkward. If you must have an
MPC now, the CompuAdd is OK, but I would wait until the MPC folks set a higher
standard for ease of use. (Reviewed 10/13/91); 3 computers; (hbox); Magazine
Rack, for PC or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a CD-ROM drive and DOS 3.1
or higher (with CD-ROM Extensions). 10MHz or faster processor, color display,
mouse and expanded memory recommended. $89.95. From Information Access Co.,
362 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404. (800) 227-8431.;   The Magazine
Rack is a CD-ROM disk packed with the full text of more than 100,000 articles
from 300 magazines. All you need is a standard PC and a CD-ROM drive. You can
search the articles by keywords, authors, subjects or dates. The price is
great for a CD-ROM, but I wish it included the article graphics, that it
collected all the important magazines and that it came out more often than
once a year.;   (Reviewed 10/6/91); 3 computers  </TEXT>
