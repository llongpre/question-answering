<TEXT>     Tempo LX. $2,999. From Everex Systems Inc., 48431 Milmont Drive, Fremont,
CA 94538. (800) 437-3837.;    If you're looking for a portable, look for a
notebook computer that weighs 5 to 7 pounds, has a 386SX processor, has at
least a 20MB hard disk, has a floppy drive, contains both full-size screen and
keyboard, supports VGA graphics and costs $3,000 or less. The Everex Tempo LX
fulfills all these requirements. The Sharp PC 6220 has only the 286 processor
and is already falling into obsolescence. Remember that a desk-top for the
same price will have much more power and storage. And more companies are
advertising notebook PCs than are shipping them. (Reviewed 3/17/91);    Sharp
PC-6220:; 2 computers;    Tempo:; 3 computers;  Inside Information, for Apple
Macintosh with at least 1 megabyte RAM, a hard disk drive and System 6.0 or
higher. $119. From Microlytics Inc., 2 Tobey Village Office Park, Pittsford,
N.Y. 14534. (716) 248-9150.;    Inside Information is a dictionary organized
by logical subjects rather than by alphabetical listings, that may help you
find definitions or words and synonyms. It also packs a "reverse dictionary"
function that can look up words to match definitions. Unfortunately many of
the definitions are too terse, many words are left out of the list altogether,
and the reverse dictionary isn't smart enough to find words for many suggested
definitions. It is definitely not a practical tool for writers, business
professionals, researchers or students. (Reviewed 3/10/91);    2 computers; 
SatisFAXtion, for IBM Personal Computer or compatible with an empty expansion
slot, at least 640K RAM, 10MB of free space on a hard disk and DOS 3.0 or
later. $499 ($549 for IBM PCs with the Microchannel bus). From Intel PCEO,
5200 N.E. Elam Young Parkway, Hillsboro, OR 97124-6497. (800) 538-3373 or
(503) 629-7000.;    SatisFAXtion is a "fax modem" board that you can plug into
PCs. It lets you send and receive faxes through the phone line without having
a regular fax machine. You send PC documents -- either created with your
programs or scanned (you need a scanner for this) -- which then appear on a
distant fax machine. You received fax documents -- seeing on screen what
someone else fed into a fax machine, then storing the image on disk or
printing it. SatisFAXtion does a good job of both tasks, has software that's
reasonably easy to use and includes a 2,400 bps "data modem." However,
SatisFAXtion's price is a bit high, and the 2,400 bps modem is obsolete.
(Reviewed 3/3/91);    3 computers;  Two-Page Monochrome Monitor, $1,775.
Portrait Display Monitor, $1,349. From Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani
Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.; Clearvue/Grayscale, $2,195. From
Rasterops Corp., 2500 Walsh Ave., Santa Clara, CA 95051. (408) 562-4200.;
Spectrum/8, $2,798. From Supermac Technology, 485 Potrero Ave., Sunnyvale, CA
94086. (408) 245-2202.; L-View Multi-Mode, $1,999. PageView, $1,399. From
Sigma Designs, 4650 Landing Parkway, Fremont, CA 94538. (415) 770-0100.;
Pivot, $1,690. TPD, $1,990. From Radius Inc., 404 East Plumeria Drive, San
Jose, CA 95134. (408) 434-1010.; Large monitors are necessary equipment for
heavy Macintosh desk-top publishing, CAD or graphics and can be useful for
anyone who uses MultiFinder. They're easy to hook up because of the Mac's
operating system, but they are heavy, expensive and differ widely in software
options and ergonomic design. My favorite full-page display (to show one full
8.5-inch by 11-inch page of text and graphics) is the Radius Pivot. My
favorite two-page displays (to show two such pages or just to provide more
room for windows and menus) are the Sigma Designs L-View and the Radius TPD.
Before you buy a monitor, though, test it yourself -- in conditions similar to
those of your work site. (Reviewed 2/24/91);    Full-page displays:; Apple
