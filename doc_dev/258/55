<LEADPARA>  WORK STATIONS are the bigger brothers (or sisters, if you like) of personal
computers. Where a typical DOS machine or Macintosh costs $2,000 to $5,000 or
so, a typical work station costs $5,000 to $15,000, sometimes much more.;  
Work stations are faster, offer better graphics and are more easily connected
into networks than personal computers. Popular work stations from companies
such as Sun, IBM and Hewlett-Packard are often used to write programs, to
analyze circuits, to forecast financial markets and to publish documents.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Indeed, some work-station fans think personal computers are toys that can
run lots of programs but few powerful ones.;   As the increasingly popular
work station becomes more of a presence in computing, you'll probably hear
more and more about work-station programs that are being rewritten to run on
PCs. After all, even though work-station programs sometimes offer more power
than PC programs, the PC market is so big that it is tempting to work-station
software makers.;   One example is FrameMaker from Frame Technology. This
program is as big a name in work-station desk-top publishing -- or electronic
publishing, as they call it there -- as PageMaker is in personal computer
desk-top publishing. It has been available for the Macintosh before, but the
latest version, 3.0 (Frame Technology, $795, (408) 433-3311), is now out and
is getting a lot of praise from analysts.;   I'm also impressed with
FrameMaker's features -- not to mention its hardware demands. Its power is
more than you'll probably need when publishing a newsletter, newspaper or even
a simple book. FrameMaker won't wean me from PageMaker, but I can see why
work-station folks love it and why a few personal computer users think it's so
hot.;   About those hardware demands: This is a program that not only wants
but needs at least 4 megabytes of RAM just to run decently. To run without
worrying about memory limitations, you'll want a full 8 megabytes or even
more. And although it will work on any Macintosh from the SE on, I don't
suggest you power it up on anything less than a recent-model Mac II. (I tried
FrameMaker on a Mac IIfx with 8 megabytes of memory -- the fastest Mac you can
buy from Apple.);   FrameMaker starts with all the basics of PageMaker or
Quark Xpress -- import and style text; import and place graphics; kerning,
leading and hyphenation; wrapping text around graphics; and so on. There's
spell-checking, style sheets, copying and pasting information between Mac
programs, and drawing tools to make pretty much whatever graphic you have in
mind. FrameMaker is unusually accommodating to graphics files, able to import
more file types than any other program I've seen.;   FrameMaker is also
up-to-date with color, the latest hot field in publishing, able to apply spot
colors and support process colors with the Quark XPress DCS standard. Along
with all these basics it adds some features you won't find in just any
desk-top publishing package, such as feathering -- justifying text vertically
on a page.;   And it adds the sorts of long-document features that the
PageMaker ilk have only reached recently: table of contents and index
generation, to name two.;   But FrameMaker grew in the work-station world,
where people are constantly turning out manuals and other documentation for
powerful computers and software.;   It shows in conditional text, tables,
equations and other long-document features. Where PageMaker is just stretching
to reach long documents, FrameMaker was born with long documents in mind.;  
For example, this latest version offers conditional text. That is, you can
include text in a document along with the conditions under which that text
should actually print.;   Why? To produce manuals for different countries, for
instance. You could include all of the text for all of the countries and then
create conditions where only the necessary text would print for each. That is
a lot simpler than having to create separate documents for each instance.;  
Conditional text would also be helpful inside a large company that had
different divisions with needs for similar documents.;   Another item that
turns up often in work-station manuals is the table. That's just what it
sounds like -- a neatly organized set of rows and columns containing text,
small graphics and symbols.;   What you may not know if you haven't tried is
that making a nice table in most desk-top publishing programs, or even in a
word processor, is a major chore. It's hard to make the columns even, to
neatly space the text inside the cells of the table, to adjust the table when
information needs to be added, to make exceptions to stretch entries across
several cells, to add periodic colors or shades to cells, and so on.;  
Microsoft Word has a minimal table command in version 4.0, and PageMaker 4.0
adds a separate utility program for making tables. But in FrameMaker tables
are as easy to work with as text or graphics and are built right into the main
document instead of being handled by a separate utility.;   If you're working
with math, FrameMaker can help you create equations right on the page, with
mathematical symbols. In fact, it can solve and simplify some equations while
you're at it.;   And when it comes time to tie a long document together,
FrameMaker has cross-references, lists of figures, lists of fonts, lists of
tables, indexes for both single and multiple documents, and more. It will
automatically number and renumber that stuff whenever you make any changes to
the document.;   I won't be using FrameMaker, because of its cost and because
of how much of my Mac's power it demands. Nor do I relish the idea of learning
all of its menus, dialogue boxes, and options, or abandoning the community of
PageMaker users and consultants who can help me through my minor publishing
troubles.;   However, if I were in a company that was producing tables for
sales literature or product documentation, the price would be insignificant,
and the difficulties worth the power. And if some of those documents were long
and complex, especially if they included technical equations, I wouldn't have
anywhere else to turn.; FrameMaker 3.0, for Macintosh SE or later with at
least 2 megabytes of RAM and hard disk drive. Macintosh II and at least 4
megabytes of RAM recommended. $995. From Frame Technology Corp., 1010 Rincon
Circle, San Jose, CA 95131. (408) 433-3311.; Summary: FrameMaker offers more
power than most personal computer desk-top publishing programs for creating
and editing tables or equations and for handling long, complex documents.
However, that power comes at the price of a high initial cost, high hardware
demands (get 8 megabytes of memory on a Mac IIfx to be truly comfortable), and
a complex interface with lots of menus, dialogue boxes, and commands to
master.; On a scale of one to four, with one indicating poor and four
indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:;   Performance: 4
computers;   Ease of use: 2 computers;   Value: 2 computers  </TEXT>
