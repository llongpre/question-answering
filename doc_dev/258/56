<LEADPARA>  Here are summaries of some recent Computing product reviews. Each product is

indicating excellent:; MindLink,  for Macintosh able to run HyperCard (meaning

<TEXT>     MindLink uses a variety of word exercises, suggestions and approaches to
help you produce, refine, collect and report ideas and solutions to problems.
Although I was skeptical of any program that purported to aid creativity, I
believe this one truly can. With a 30-day money-back guarantee, MindLink is
worth a try by anyone who is comfortable with the Mac and wants to get out of
a mental rut. The only drawback is that you may need to spend a few hours
before you're completely comfortable with the program's terminology and
structure. (A Windows version is available for PCs.) (Reviewed 10/28/91); 3
computers; (hbox); Connections for Macintosh. $199 (or $149 through December
from Heizer Software, (800) 888-7667). From Concentrix Technology Inc., 1875
S. Grant St., Suite 760, San Mateo, CA 94402. (415) 358-8600.;   Connections
is a Personal Information Manager for the Macintosh. It helps you keep and
organize a to-do list, a schedule for appointments and reminders and a
telephone call log. It also keeps a phone/address directory and any quick
notes you want to type. Connections can link and sort these various lists and
can even share the schedule with other Connections users on a network. It
automates many aspects of personal information handling and comes closer than
most PIMs to being a practical replacement for the paper organizer notebook.
However, it is more complex to learn than I would like and demands lots of RAM
(4 megabytes) and processor speed to be practical. (Reviewed 10/20/91); 3
computers; (hbox); CompuAdd Multimedia 320sc.  $3,195. From Compuadd, 12303
Technology Blvd., Austin, TX 78727. (800) 627-1967.;   The CompuAdd 320sc
Multimedia personal computer is one of the first systems to appear with the
new MPC trademark. This indicates it meets the official MPC standard, a
minimum of software and hardware abilities for multimedia agreed upon by a
dozen important PC hardware and software companies. The 320sc is really just a
386SX-based PC with an added audio board, a CD-ROM drive and the multimedia
extensions to Windows. The 320sc works well and offers a faster CD-ROM drive
than you'll find in just any MPC, along with free speakers and a microphone.
But its price isn't anything special, and the way its software works (though
admittedly just as the MPC spec calls for) is too awkward. If you must have an
MPC now, then the CompuAdd is a decent choice, but I would wait until the MPC
folks set a higher standard for ease of use. (Reviewed 10/13/91); 3 computers;
(hbox); Magazine Rack, for PC or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a CD-ROM
drive and DOS 3.1 or higher (with CD-ROM Extensions). 10MHz or faster
processor, color display, mouse and expanded memory recommended. $89.95. From
Information Access Co., 362 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404. (800)
227-8431.;   The Magazine Rack is a CD-ROM disk packed with the full text of
more than 100,000 articles from 300 magazines on business, computers, health
and general interest. All you need to read these articles is a standard PC and
a CD-ROM drive. You search the articles by keywords, authors, subjects or
dates and read the articles on screen or print them. The price is great for a
CD-ROM. I like having this much information at hand, but I wish it included
the article graphics (it has none), that it collected all the important
magazines (some big names are left out), that it came out once a month or at
least quarterly instead of once a year (I only have 1990 articles on the
current disk) and that its software let me read articles while I was using
other PC programs (popping up alongside Lotus or WordPerfect). (Reviewed
10/6/91); 3 computers  </TEXT>
