<LEADPARA>  WINDOWS 3.0, DOS 5, System 7 on the Mac: It seems all of my computing
foundations have been relaid in the past year.;   I'm glad for the changes
because I'm getting to run larger programs in more memory with more-helpful
screen displays.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I'm annoyed at the changes because I'm bumping into incompatibilities with
some of my old programs, and the new screen displays sometimes don't help
enough.;   So I dug into my software pile to find some fixes, some programs
that will improve on these improved interfaces.;   Disk Manager Mac (Ontrack,
$69.95, (800) 752-1333) doesn't do many things, but it does what I needed
desperately.;   You've probably heard of the exciting features of the new
System 7.0 operating system software for the Mac: virtual memory, aliases,
integrated task switching and some multitasking, "balloon help" and
even-simpler installation of new fonts and utilities.;   My problem is that
not all programs are compatible with System 7.0. For now, System 7.0 is a
sometimes thing for me. Part of the time I want to run it to get those great
new features, the rest of the time I want to dump it and retreat to System 6
so I can run my old software. But installing and uninstalling the two systems
takes a lot of time and bother. I want to have them both at my beck and call.;
  Disk Manager Mac lets me do just that. This program understands disks: hard,
optical and removable -- practically any disk hooked up to a SCSI interface
(which is how the Mac gets at its hard disk). Disk Manager Mac lets you format
them, find and automatically avoid any damaged areas on them, choose an
interleave rate for them (to set how quickly they transfer information),
protect your files on them with passwords and partition them.;   Many of those
operations are beyond my day-to-day, or even year-to-year, needs. They're the
kind of thing that real technophiles like, though, and that technicians often
use when fine-tuning a Mac. Unfortunately, the screen displays and information
on using them is also aimed at such experts.;   Even the partitioning command
I needed was a bit opaque at first. But I figured out how to use it to split
my single, large Macintosh hard disk into two "logical partitions." Each
partition acts as if it is a separate hard disk drive. I installed System 6 on
one, System 7.0 on the other and then put the Disk Manager "mounter" utility
into my Apple menu for each system.;   Now when I start the Mac, it comes
alive running one of those systems. To change to the other system, I just pull
down the Apple menu, tell the mounter utility to change "boot" disks (really
changing which partition the Mac will "boot" or start from), turn my Mac off
and then start it again. The other system appears without pain, and all of my
application programs and utilities are still there on the disks, ready to run
in whatever system they find.;   The Norton Desktop for Windows (Symantec,
$149, (408) 253-9600) is a program that runs on top of Windows, which runs on
top of DOS, which runs on your IBM Personal Computer or compatible.;   Why
have so many layers?;   Because a PC must have an operating system, like DOS.
But DOS is too hard to use, so Windows is put on top of it. But many Windows
fans end up having to leave Windows to reach common DOS functions and then
return to Windows to run their new applications. So the Norton crew has a
package that not only gives you some of that missing stuff as handy Windows
utility programs, it also changes the mien of Windows.;   The Norton Desktop
installs automatically on Windows and replaces the Windows Program Manager
utility as your working display. Although it retains the general look (icons,
pulldown menus) of the Program Manager and has the menu commands you'll find
in the Program Manager, it adds more.;   There's a tools menu with a bunch of
utilities: SuperFind, to quickly search through any or all of your files for
any particular bit of information.;   Viewer, to see what's in a file --
graphics, text or other -- without opening its application program.;  
SmartErase, to recover erased files that you want back.;   Shredder, to erase
files so completely even SmartErase can't get them back.;   Sleeper, a
"screensaver" to blank your screen when you haven't done anything for a
while.;   System Information, which tells you how much memory you have, how
fast your processor is and other simple and technical stuff.;  
Backup/Restore, which helps you automate making safety copies of your files.; 
 Keyfinder, for figuring out which key to use to make unusual symbols or
punctuation.;   Batch Builder, which lets you create batch files to automate
other tasks.;   Icon Editor, to make Icons for Windows programming work.;   Is
that enough?;   All of this comes with icons and other controls that make
Windows easier to use than the controls Microsoft ships and more like the
easier Macintosh.;   And there's the emergency disk, a separate floppy that
packs DOS programs for repairing a hard disk, unformatting a hard disk and
unerasing lost files. I carry this disk with me.;   What's not in this
desk-top? The biggest missing links are virus protection and file
compression.;   There are two drawbacks to The Norton Desktop for Windows --
it uses up a lot of your hard disk, in the range of 6 megabytes. Also,
installing the Norton Desktop slows Windows down, at least when loading and
exiting Windows. That effect is magnified on a lap-top, which has a slower
processor chip. For me, that means my desk-top has it; my lap-top won't.;  
But the Norton Desktop for Windows gives you an amazing number of utilities
for a great price. I'd buy it just for the File Manager, SmartErase and
SuperFind utilities. I would pay separately to get the File Viewer,
Backup/Restore and Sleeper utilities.;   Basically, I'm a convert. I liked
Windows before, but I like it even better when it borrows some of the best
from DOS and the Mac. I'm making the Norton Desktop part of my standard
Windows setup.; Disk Manager-Mac, for Mac Plus, SE, SE/30, II, LC or Classic
with System 5 or later software. $69.95. From Ontrack Computer Systems, 6321
Bury Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55346. (800) 752-1333.;    The Norton Desktop for
Windows, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0 in Standard or Enhanced mode
and hard disk. $149. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA
95014-2132. (408) 253-9600; Summary: Disk Manager Mac lets you inspect,
install and partition most any Macintosh hard disk. It can partition a single
hard disk into separate areas that can start System 7.0 and System 6 software.
That lets you switch back and forth between the two systems quickly and
easily. The Norton Desktop for Windows is a collection of many useful
utilities organized with a better screen and more commands than you'll find in
standard Windows. It improves Windows a lot -- making it both more Mac-like
and more able to perform typical DOS functions -- at a surprisingly low
price.; On a scale of one to four, with one indicating poor and four
indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:; Disk Manager-Mac;
Performance: 4 computers; Ease of use: 3 computers; Value: 3 computers; Norton
Desktop for Windows; Performance: 4 computers; Ease of use: 4 computers;
Value: 4 computers  </TEXT>
