<LEADPARA>  I HAVE to tell you about two of the best programs you can find for Macintosh
or IBM PC computers. They're powerful, easy to use, inexpensive and even fun.
But, unfortunately, many of you won't have any use for either program in your
daily computing duties. You see, they're technical programs -- the kind that
interest propeller-heads. These programs solve equations and analyze data.;   
Wait. Please don't run away yet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's important to know about this kind of software, to see what can be done
with a personal computer and how even complex tasks can be made simple with
the right software. If only the average word processor were this
well-crafted.;    Mathcad 3.0 (MathSoft, $495, (617) 577-1017) solves
equations and graphs the results. Basically it's a calculator -- but what a
calculator. This program could make math fun.;    Where any hand-held
calculator can solve arithmetic problems, and a powerful calculator can tackle
trigonometry, statistics and business problems, Mathcad can do calculus,
interpolation, matrices and vectors, linear regression, Fourier series and
more.;    The way you pose problems to it is so natural. You just click in the
main Mathcad window, type your equation and press return. Mathcad quickly
slaps the solution on the screen. You then click on any element in your
equation, change it, and the result will be recalculated in a snap.;    There
are scores of built-in functions you can type, from simple trig to Bessell
functions and matrix manipulations.;    There are even conditional functions
to help you create flexible equations. You can graph the results in a variety
of ways, including log plots, plot traces, surface plots and more.;    Then
you can take those results, including the graphs, save them, cut them out and
paste them into another program or leave them as a Mathcad window and add text
comments to explain what you've done. This is a smart blackboard, where you
scribble equations and watch solutions magically appear.;    The most
fascinating part of Mathcad are the symbolic solutions. You type a calculus or
other expression that cannot be solved for a particular value. Mathcad can
work to simplify or evaluate that expression as much as possible,
symbolically. Lengthy integrals become no more troublesome than addition or
multiplication.;    Mathcad comes with an excellent tutorial, lots of on-line
help, a built-in handbook of common equations and dozens of example equations
and graphs you can play with.;    Mathcad doesn't eliminate the need to think,
but it does eliminate the need to sweat out solutions for each possibly useful
equation. Mathcad alone is a good reason to supply technical professionals and
students with a personal computer and a math co-processor chip.;    LabVIEW 2
(National Instruments, $1,995, (800) 433-3488) is the brains of a laboratory
on a computer screen. It lets you build data acquisition, control and
presentation instruments as figments of your Mac's imagination. (There's also
a PC version that runs under Windows.) It all comes from the idea of "virtual
instruments.";    It works like this. You have a job to do, either collecting
information from some electric or electronic devices around the lab (or
mechanical devices that report themselves electronically), analyzing such
collected information, presenting the results of that analysis, or all three.
You make a list of the input, what you want to do with the information
received, what sort of control and feedback you want to have on the equipment
and in what presentation form you want the final information.;    Without
LabVIEW 2, you would buy a strip chart recorder to plot the incoming
information, an oscilloscope to watch the wave form received, a thermometer to
monitor temperature, a bunch of knobs and dials to let you dictate the signals
to send back and so on. Then you would try to hook all those things together,
in some kind of rack, and add electronics to let them intelligently report to
each other and perhaps to some computer.;    With LabVIEW 2, you hook all of
the inputs up to your Mac (you'll need input boards for this) and create
"virtual instruments" for collection, analysis and presentation. You click on
basic building block icons from LabVIEW's palettes, just as if you were
drawing rectangles and lines in MacDraw, placing them in a window on screen
and then connecting them with "virtual wires" to show where signals should
flow. You add logical instructions, such as "if this temperature exceeds such
and such a value, light an alarm light" or "when a certain number of data
points have been collected, proceed to the next virtual instrument." Now you
have a block diagram that shows how the information is directed.;    Then you
use more LabVIEW icons to create a front panel for your instrument diagram,
putting up images of thermometers, knobs, dials, chart recorders, fill
indicators, LEDs, slides, switches and more.;    If something isn't working
right, you can change virtual instruments or the virtual front panel in
minutes instead of the hours or days required of real hardware.;    The
complete LabVIEW 2 can occupy 20MB of your hard disk, and you may need a class
or a consultant to learn the most advanced levels of LabVIEW 2 programming.
Although $1,995 is a bargain price for professionals, it is steep for schools.
However, I can't help but think LabVIEW 2 is the future for instrumentation
because its flexibility will make it far less expensive than any hardware
instrumentation. Because it runs on the Mac or under Windows, you'll be able
to directly export LabVIEW 2 data results, too, for manipulation by other Mac
and PC programs.;    Mathcad 3 and LabVIEW 2 both use the graphic interface of
PCs and Macs to their best advantage. They mimic real-world props and images
that will help quicken understanding, and also add that magical intelligence
and malleability to those creations that makes computers so powerful. In a few
years, I can't see people solving equations or building instruments any other
way, except out of sentiment or as a one-time educational exercise to learn
how it could be done by hand.;    Mathcad 3.0, for PC or compatible running
Windows 3.0. $495. From Mathsoft Inc., 201 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02139.
(617) 577-1017.;    LabVIEW 2, for any Macintosh with at least 3MB of free
hard disk space and 3.5MB of RAM. $1,995. From National Instruments Corp.,
6504 Bridge Point Parkway, Austin, TX 78730-5039. (800) 433-3488 or (512)
794-0100.; Summary: Mathcad 3.0 is an equation-solving program for PCs running
Windows. It is easy to use for anything from elementary-school arithmetic to
graduate-level analysis, statistics and calculus. You type an equation in its
window, and Mathcad pops out the solution, graphs the results and asks for
more. It can handle symbolic equations in algebra and calculus. LabVIEW 2 lets
you build "virtual instruments" and "virtual front panels" on a Mac or PC
screen to collect, analyze, control and present data from laboratory
equipment. It is a programming language where you create instruments and
panels out of picture icons. Within a few years, this is how all equation
solving and instrument building will be done, except in museums and as
practice exercises in classrooms.; On a scale of one to four, with one
indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:;
