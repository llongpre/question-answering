<TEXT>     Inside Information is a dictionary organized by logical subjects rather
than by alphabetical listings, that may help you find definitions or words and
synonyms. It also packs a "reverse dictionary" function that can look up words
to match definitions. Unfortunately many of the definitions are too terse,
many words are left out of the list altogether, and the reverse dictionary
isn't smart enough to find words for many definitions. As a fun data base of
information for browsing, Inside Information could be an expensive educational
toy or a crossword puzzle reference. It is definitely not a practical tool for
writers, business professionals, researchers, students or others it hopes to
appeal to, who would be better off with a printed dictionary or encyclopedia
or with a CD-ROM on-line encyclopedia. (Reviewed 3/10/91); 2 computers;
(hbox); SatisFAXtion, for IBM Personal Computer or compatible with an empty
expansion slot, at least 640K RAM, 10MB of free space on a hard disk and DOS
3.0 or later. $499 ($549 for IBM PCs with the Microchannel bus). From Intel
PCEO, 5200 N.E. Elam Young Parkway, Hillsboro, OR 97124-6497. (800) 538-3373
or (503) 629-7000.;    SatisFAXtion is a "fax modem" board that you can plug
into PCs. It lets you send and receive faxes through the phone line without
having a regular fax machine. You send PC documents -- either created with
your programs or scanned (you need a scanner for this) -- which then appear on
a distant fax machine. You received fax documents -- seeing on screen what
someone else fed into a fax machine, then storing the image on disk or
printing it. SatisFAXtion does a good job of both tasks, has software that's
reasonably easy to use and includes a 2,400 bps "data modem" -- the standard
kind for sending documents from computer to computer. However, SatisFAXtion's
price is a bit high -- you can buy fax modems for $140 now -- and the 2,400
bps modem is obsolete. (Reviewed 3/3/91); 3 computers; (hbox); Two-Page

Large monitors are necessary equipment for heavy Macintosh desk-top
publishing, CAD or graphics and can be useful for anyone who uses MultiFinder.
They're easy to hook up because of the Mac's operating system, but they are
heavy, expensive and differ widely in software options and ergonomic design.
My favorite full-page display (to show one full 8.5-inch by 11-inch page of
text and graphics) is the Radius Pivot. My favorite two-page displays (to show
two such pages or just to provide more room for windows and menus) are the
Sigma Designs L-View and the Radius TPD. Before you buy a monitor, though,
test it yourself -- in lighting conditions as close to those of your work site
as possible. (Reviewed 2/24/91); Full-page displays:; Apple Portrait Display:;
