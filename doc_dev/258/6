<TEXT>     SideKick 2.0 is the newest version of the original utility that gives users
several useful functions any time, even when other programs are running.
Version 2.0 adds power to the original note pad, (spelling checker, thesaurus,
margins and formats), to the calculators (more math functions), and to the
address book (room for more details per record, and pager-messaging). It
transforms the simple scheduler into a Time Planner that can work on a network
and can reconcile changed schedules from a portable and an office-bound PC. It
also adds a communications module for simple modem work, with a surprisingly
sophisticated scripting ability. In return, this new SideKick drops the file
management and outlining abilities of SideKick Plus, wants 3 megabytes of your
hard disk and is slower than the original. This is a good focal point for
anyone's computing on a PC and could be a great deal for anyone having trouble
juggling schedules on multiple machines or a network. (Reviewed 2/17/91);    4
computers;  TouchBASE, for any Macintosh with 1 megabyte of memory, two floppy
drives (hard disk highly recommended), and System 6.0.5 or higher. $125. From
After Hours Software, 5636 Van Nuys Blvd., Suite B, Van Nuys, CA 91401. (818)
780-2220.;    TouchBASE is a "contacts data base" -- that is, a computerized
address book -- that installs as a desk accessory on your Macintosh so it is
always on hand even when you run some other program. TouchBASE lets you easily
enter, store, sort, search through and print reports, fax cover sheets, labels
and envelopes from the addresses in the data base. It is a bit too expensive
at the full retail price and can't print a chronological list of the calls you
make from its numbers but has lots of options for fast and fancy searching. I
recommend it, though only if your Mac has a hard disk. (Reviewed 2/10/91);   
3 computers;  Type Manager 2.0, Type Reunion, TypeAlign, for Macintosh Plus,
SE, II or Portable with at least two disk drives. Type Manager 2.0, $99; Type
Reunion, $65; TypeAlign, $99.95. From Adobe Systems, 1585 Charleston Road,
P.O. Box 7900, Mountain View, CA 94039-7900. (415) 961-4400.;    TypeStyler
1.5, for Macintosh Plus, SE, SE30, II or Portable with at least two disk
drives. $199.95. From Broderbund Software, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA
94903-2101. (415) 492-3200.;    If you just process words, you don't need to
worry much about fonts. But for those producing graphic designs, logos,
newspapers, magazines and so on, Type Manager 2.0 from Adobe is a must. It
automatically improves the look of characters on screen, especially large
ones. A related Adobe utility, Type Reunion, automatically organizes all the
fonts listed in the Mac's font menu. This can be a godsend, although the price
of Reunion is a little high. Adobe's TypeAlign is a desk accessory for shaping
and distorting text, which can work with millions of colors and can force type
to follow any path you draw. It's relatively easy to use but doesn't have many
of the features of the competing TypeStyler from Broderbund, which includes
built-in libraries of effects, shapes and gradient fills, along with clear
commands for molding text into almost any form. (Reviewed 2/3/91);    Type
