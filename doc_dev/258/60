<TEXT>     The Norton AntiVirus, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least 384K of RAM
and DOS 2.1. $129.95. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA
95014. (408) 253-9600.;    Virex-PC, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least
512K of RAM and DOS 2.1. $129.95. From Microcom Inc., P.O. Box 51816, Durham,
N.C. 27717. (919) 490-1277.;    Virucide, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at
least 256K RAM and DOS 2.0. $49. From Parsons Technology, 375 Collins Road NE,
Cedar Rapids, IA 52402. (800) 779-6000.;    If you download files from
bulletin boards, share disks with friends or are connected to a local area
network, it makes sense to use an anti-virus utility. Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus
Toolkit is a bunch of utilities that can detect or analyze certain virus
actions. It is difficult to use and is quite slow. Virex-PC finds and prevents
virus infections, but its many options are set up in a confusing way. The
Norton AntiVirus is the most thorough program for virus eradication and
prevention and is easily installed and used. Norton also provides the best
upgrade scheme to catch new viruses -- with an on-line bulletin board.
Virucide is the least expensive, is just as fast as Virex or Norton, targets a
longer list of known viruses but lacks a prevention feature. (Reviewed
1/27/91); Dr. Solomon's;    1 computer; The Norton AntiVirus;    4 computers;
Virex-PC;    3 computers; Virucide;    4 computers; (hbox);    Quattro Pro
2.0, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk and DOS
2.0 or higher. Charts require video graphics adapter. $495. Upgrade from
Quattro Pro free if you purchased since July 18; $79.95 if you bought before
that; $99.95 upgrade from competing spreadsheets. From Borland International,
1800 Green Hills Road, PO Box 660001, Scotts Valley, CA 95066-0001. (408)
438-8400.;    Quattro Pro 2.0 adds tight integration to the Paradox 3.5
data-base manager, 3-D chart types, a drawing feature, a solve-for command and
interactive slide show "hypertext" buttons to the already popular commands,
menus and options of Quattro Pro. Although the technical support isn't as good
as it should be, Quattro Pro 2.0 is easier to use and more graphic than Lotus
1-2-3 and runs on smaller PCs and is more Lotus-compatible than Excel (even
operating with Lotus 1-2-3 commands). The upgrade price of $99.95 from any
competing spreadsheet is a great deal. (Reviewed 1/20/91); 4 computers;
(hbox);     DataClub, for Macintosh Plus or greater in an AppleTalk-compatible
network. $295 for 3 users, $795 for 10 users. From International Business
Software, 1270 Oakmead Parkway, Suite 314 Sunnyvale, CA 94086-4034. (408)
522-8000 or (800) 733-2822.;    Macintosh networks are much easier and cheaper
to set up than Personal Computer networks. But the "dedicated server" Mac
networks such as AppleShare can be expensive because they demand that a
dedicated Mac act as a "file server" system. DataClub runs on the typical Mac
network and creates a "virtual server" by borrowing disk memory from any Mac
on the net that has extra. It makes sharing files very quick and easy but
provides several levels of security to protect private information. Tops used
to be the simpler, cheaper network, but DataClub beats it on expense and setup
simplicity. (Reviewed 1/13/91); 3 computers; (hbox); Personal R:Base, for PC,
XT, AT, PS/1, PS/2 or compatible with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk, running
DOS 3.1 or higher. $99 (introductory price until Jan. 31, then $299). From
Microrim Inc., 3925 159th Ave. NE, P.O. Box 97022, Redmond, WA 98073-9722.
(206) 649-9500.;    Personal R:Base lacks the programming language and network
features of regular R:Base but does offer pull-down menus, context-sensitive
help, multiple file query and browsing, reporting and form generation
commands, dBASE and Lotus file compatibility, an applications generator and
ready-to-run applications for "personal" stuff. And it needs less hardware
than most relational data-base managers do. Especially at the introductory
price of $99, it is a great deal for anyone who needs to work with dBASE files
on a lap-top or for anyone who wants to dip their toes into relational
data-base management. However, it is not easy to learn and is more power than
a home user needs. A better name would be "traveling R:Base." (Reviewed
