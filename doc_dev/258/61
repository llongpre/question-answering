<LEADPARA>  Here are summaries of some recent Computing product reviews. Each product is
rated on a scale of one to four, with one computer indicating poor and four
indicating excellent:;    Personal R:Base, for PC, XT, AT, PS/1, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk, running DOS 3.1 or higher. $99
(introductory price until Jan. 31, then $299). From Microrim Inc., 3925 159th
Ave. NE, P.O. Box 97022, Redmond, WA 98073-9722. (206) 649-9500.;    Personal
R:Base lacks the programming language and network features of regular R:Base
but does offer pull-down menus, context-sensitive help, multiple file query,
as well as browsing, reporting and form generation commands, dBASE and Lotus
file compatibility, an applications generator and ready-to-run applications
for "personal" stuff such as home finance, mailing list and appointments
organizing, home inventory and even recipe and shopping list management. And
it needs less hardware than most relational data-base managers do. Especially
at the introductory price of $99, it is a great deal for anyone who needs to
work with dBASE files on a lap-top or for anyone who wants to dip his or her
toes into relational data-base management. However, it is not easy to learn
and has more power than anyone needs in the home. A better name would be
"traveling R:Base." (Reviewed 1/6/91)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  3 computers; (hbox);     Monologue, for PC, XT, AT, PS/1, PS/2 or compatible
with at least 384K RAM running DOS 3.0 or higher. $75 until Jan. 15, then
$149. From First Byte, Clauset Centre, 3100 South Harbor Blvd., Suite 150,
Santa Ana, CA 92704. (714) 432-1740.;     PicturePress, for Mac II or SE/30
with System 6.0.4 or higher and 32-bit QuickDraw. $199. From Storm Technology,
220 California Ave., Suite 101, Palo Alto, CA 94306. (415) 322-0506.;   
Monologue is a PC utility that can read aloud to you any text or numbers on
the screen. You can use it to hear your E-mail, proofread your text documents
or speak a spreadsheet to someone without vision. It is easy to use, lets you
choose the pitch and speed of the voice and supports but doesn't require
speech add-on hardware. The big drawback is that Monologue needs expanded
memory to be practical -- adding to the cost. PicturePress is a graphics file
compression utility for the Macintosh II. It lets you squeeze huge 32-bit
color images to one-half, one-tenth or even one-hundredth of their original
size. You balance the quality of the squeezed image against the amount of
compression. For graphics professionals, PicturePress may soon be standard
fare. For infrequent users, a general compression utility or the compression
option built into the latest graphics program -- such as Studio/32 -- can be
enough. (Reviewed 12/30/90); Monologue; 2 computers; PicturePress; 3
computers; (hbox); Storyboard Live!, for PC-XT, AT, PS/1, PS/2 or compatible
with at least 640K RAM, a hard disk and an EGA, VGA, 8514/A or compatible
graphics adapter. Mouse recommended. $495. From IBM Desktop Software,
Applications Systems Division, 472 Wheelers Farms Road, Milford, CT 06460.
(404) 956-4000.;    Storyboard Live! offers commands for creating or capturing
computer graphics, full-motion and still video and audio, and for laying those
multiple media down as presentations. It doesn't have much multimedia
competition yet and could be worth the time and money for someone with a PC
who desperately needs the excitement of multimedia to sell or educate.
However, it is very difficult to use because it divides those functions into
five modules and then infects those modules with a confusing variety of menus,
buttons and icons. Two of the modules -- screen capture and picture painting
-- are weak. Another -- story presenting -- is merely adequate. The other two
-- for creating and for editing the presentation -- are confusing. The result
is a convincing argument that multimedia is still more an advertising slogan
than a practical PC tool. (Reviewed 12/23/90); 1 computer  </TEXT>
