<LEADPARA>  MPC IS HERE, the new multimedia personal computer standard.;   For years,
people have been looking forward to personal computers that could combine
text, graphics, animation, sound, music, voice and video in education,
training and business programs. Some computers and some programs used several
of those media. Very few could handle them all.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Amiga had an early lead in video and sound, but the more popular
Macintosh overtook it in many arenas. The IBM Personal Computer was a no-show
in the multimedia race, without the hardware or software to handle sound or
video.;   Last November, AT&amp;T, CompuAdd, Creative Labs, Fujitsu, Headland,
Media Vision, NEC, Olivetti, Tandy and Zenith announced plans to build PCs
that could handle multimedia.;   IBM and Compaq weren't part of this
collection, but the members did have some authority of their own. AT&amp;T,
CompuAdd, NEC, Olivetti, Tandy and Zenith are famous for their PC-compatible
systems. Creative Labs makes the most popular PC audio plug-in board, to give
PCs the ability to make and edit noises, music and even voice. Fujitsu,
Headland and Media Vision are known for their PC video hardware.;   By March,
Philips (famous for CD-ROM optical disk technology and other consumer
electronics) and Microsoft (maker of the DOS and Windows systems software and
a big fan of CD-ROM technology) joined the group.;   An official MPC trademark
was announced. (The MPC specification basically describes a PC that can run
Microsoft's Windows efficiently because the system software beneath multimedia
would be "Windows with Multimedia Extensions." The spec also calls for added
audio and CD-ROM hardware.);   Now those companies are selling MPC systems and
software. I got an early look at one of CompuAdd's MPC systems, and I think
it's both exciting and awkward.;   The CompuAdd Multimedia 320sc (CompuAdd,
$3,195, (800) 627-1967) meets the MPC specification and has a few extras
thrown in. CompuAdd is one of those mail-order companies that has quickly
grown from nothing to hundreds of millions of dollars in sales through great
prices and good service on complete IBM-compatible PCs.;   The 320sc starts as
a PC-compatible with a 386sx processor running at 20MHz. That's a pretty good
speed for basic Windows work. The MPC spec only requires a 286 processor, but
I wouldn't settle for that or even for a 16MHz 386sx. Speed is important when
you're processing the huge flows of information that make up sophisticated
audio and video. And if you're going to develop multimedia, not just absorb
it, you'll want the power of a 486 processor.;   Along with the 386sx, you'll
find two megabytes of RAM in the 320sc. That's what the spec calls for, but I
think you should have at least four megabytes for multimedia work under
Windows. Besides, memory is only about $45 a megabyte now.;   There's also a
32K memory cache in the 320sc, which will help the processing speed.;   The
320sc has three drives: a 3 1/2-inch floppy drive, an 80MB hard disk drive and
a CD-ROM drive. The spec calls for that floppy drive and at least 30MB of hard
drive, but the 80MB will be much more practical, especially if you're using
your MPC for regular computing work such as spreadsheets and word processors.;
  The CD-ROM drive is three times faster than the spec demands, reading
typical information in only 350 milliseconds instead of a full second. CD-ROMs
are vital to full multimedia because sound and video information take up lots
of disk space, far more than a typical hard disk could hold.;   The MPC
specification calls for VGA video, which I see as a sad minimum. The 320sc
contains a Super-VGA adapter that gives a bit more resolution and color than
that minimum.;   MPCs need a keyboard, a mouse, a serial port, a parallel
port, a MIDI port (for music information) and a joystick port. The CompuAdd
has all of these.;   Finally, to handle the "audio" side of multimedia, MPCs
need audio hardware that can handle noises, music synthesis and audio mixing.
The CompuAdd 320sc gets its sound from a plug-in audio board. CompuAdd throws
in speakers and a microphone.;   For software, the 320sc comes with Windows
and the multimedia extensions already installed. CompuAdd is promising a
special additional program called the "Rack," which simulates traditional
stereo controls, offering on-screen dials and buttons to choose channels and
set volume. I didn't get to see this, but I like the idea.;   The CompuAdd
320sc meets the MPC specification and pushes beyond it in a few areas: faster
processor, larger hard disk, more audio and video features, special "Rack"
software and bundled speakers. CompuAdd is also promising some interesting
options, such as an AM/FM radio receiver board and a TV receiver board. That's
the good news.;   The not-so-good news is that the MPC standard is truly a
minimum. Most people working with multimedia soon will want more power, memory
and video than you'll find even in the CompuAdd machine. And from my
experience, they'll want it more smoothly integrated. I expected to be able to
just drop a CD-ROM disk into the drive and watch an encyclopedia or game with
video, sounds and other "wow!" features appear on screen.;   Instead I had to
use DOS commands to install things, puzzle through unexplained Windows
utilities, and muck about plugging in speaker wires.;   I'm also concerned
about the price. If you figure the CD-ROM drive costs about $500 and the audio
board several hundred more, I'm not sure $3,195 is such a good price for a
386sx machine, even with those things tossed in.;   And that's what this and
all other MPCs are at root: just plain-old DOS PCs with added audio and a
CD-ROM drive. You can even build your own MPC, adding to your current PC,
using the upgrade kits that CompuAdd and most other MPC companies will offer.;
  When the multimedia does appear on screen and through the speakers, you may
have the same "this is what computers should do" feeling I get. But multimedia
and MPC won't become the truly universal coin of computing that some predict
until it is more affordable and less awkward.;   If you must have an MPC now,
then the CompuAdd is a decent choice, but I would wait, especially for home
use by those not familiar with PCs and Windows, until the MPC folks set a
higher standard for easy use. Or I would just add the media I need to a
standard PC: plug in an audio board, substitute a better video board and so
on.; CompuAdd Multimedia 320sc.  $3,195. From CompuAdd, 12303 Technology
Blvd., Austin, TX 78727. (800) 627-1967.; Summary: The CompuAdd 320sc
Multimedia personal computer is one of the first systems to appear with the
new MPC trademark. This indicates it meets the official MPC standard, a
minimum of software and hardware abilities for multimedia agreed upon by a
dozen important PC hardware and software companies. The 320sc is really just a
386SX-based PC with an added audio board, a CD-ROM drive and the multimedia
extensions to Windows. The 320sc works well and offers a faster CD-ROM drive
than you'll find in just any MPC, along with free speakers and a microphone.
But its price isn't anything special, and the way its software works (though
admittedly just as the MPC spec calls for) is too awkward. If you must have an
MPC now, then the CompuAdd is a decent choice, but I would wait, especially
for home use by those not familiar with PCs and Windows, until the MPC folks
set a higher standard for ease of use.; On a scale of one to four, with one
indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:;
