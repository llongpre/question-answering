<LEADPARA>  MY CANDIDATE for most interesting program of the year isn't the latest version
of HyperCard nor Lotus' Improv spreadsheet for the Next computer nor any other
business program.;    It's a children's painting program called Kid Pix
(Broderbund, $49.95, (415) 492-3200). A few minutes with this program
rejuvenated my excitement to see what's coming next in computers because it
was programmed with imagination instead of adhering religiously to standards.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now, standards are good. That is, people are always telling me they're
good. And I believe it much of the time.;    Without hardware standards, we
wouldn't have cheap personal computers or much software. Companies couldn't
afford to create as many programs if they couldn't sell them to a huge market.
More hardware to support means more programming effort, and that means fewer
new programs.;    Standards also can mean portability. You can move your
information from one computer to another. Better yet, you can move your skills
from one program to another. In software, standardization means that you or I
can learn to run a new program like we learn to drive a new car and not like
we learn to speak a new language.;    But standards also can become
straitjackets, convincing us that there is only one right way to do
something.;    Surely you've seen this effect in software, where so many try
to copy what they can from the leader in each area. Spreadsheets look a lot
like Lotus 1-2-3; data bases act a lot like dBASE. We should be thankful that
word processors aren't all trying to look like WordPerfect, which is an
armadillo to break into and use. (Eight of the top 10 computer books are about
WordPerfect. That tells you something about what users are crying for.);   
Now and then, however, a program comes along to remind us of the infinite
malleability of computers. Creating such a program is not just a matter of
studying the market and then applying great technical brainpower. You also
need to not be blinded by the way it has always been done.;    Kid Pix is
MacPaint with colors, wacky sounds and lots of juvenile drawing tools. Started
as a marvelous shareware program, Kid Pix is fun with no purpose. Or maybe the
purpose is to teach beginners the ways of the Macintosh interface -- you know,
mouse movements, dialogue boxes, tool palettes and so on. Nah, who cares.;   
This is a toy. There is humor and sound and lots of corners to explore in this
program. A few hours with it has convinced my 5-year-old daughter Jamaica that
she needs yet more time with it. (It has replaced NumberMaze as her favorite
program.) We're afraid she'll wear out the printer as she produces multiple
copies of her masterpieces. My editor had to bring his daughter in to work on
the weekend just to give her some Kid Pix time.;    Get it running, and you'll
see a typical paint program screen with pull-down menus of commands and a
"palette" full of tiny graphic image icons for other commands.;    But instead
of the dozen or so icons of an adult's serious paint program, Kid Pix has
scores of icons. For example, instead of a simple "eraser" image for deleting
stuff from the screen, Kid Pix offers plain erasing, explosive erasing (a tiny
dynamite stick with apropos erasure noises and visual effects), a black hole
(again with sounds and visuals) and so on.;    Instead of just placing letters
on screen when you select the text tool, Kid Pix reads them to you in a
variety of cute children's voices. (You can install the Spanish alphabet along
with voices pronouncing each of those letters as an alternative. Or, if you
have a Mac with sound input ability -- such as the LC or an add-on such as
MacRecorder -- you can add your own sounds to the program.);    There are lots
of "rubber-stamp" images (my daughter's favorite is the pony) that can be
easily slapped on any screen image. Then there's the "hidden picture," where a
random selection from a library of 20 images is uncovered gradually by
erasing, much as a lottery ticket is scratched to find the surprise
underneath.;    A "small kids" mode takes most of the menus off screen to
simplify the program and to protect your other Mac software from a wandering
mouse.;    I love this program. If you have a kid and a Mac, get Kid Pix. If
you have a Mac and no kid, get Kid Pix (and maybe the kid, but that's another
week's review).;    Now, I'm not saying that business programs should directly
borrow ideas from Kid Pix, though the explosive erasing would be welcome on my
spreadsheet. I am saying that now and then we need to look to a program such
as Kid Pix to reawaken a demand for more from our software.;    Piling up
features, porting to Windows and rewriting to the 386 for speed shouldn't be
the universal goal of next year's spreadsheets and data bases. We need not
only more speed, larger files and higher resolution pictures. We also need
more use of sound and other communication and information media, more
innovation in tools and commands, more imagination in program design.;    And
standards? Let's keep them. But let's build them as fences we can see through
instead of as walls that block our views.; KidPix, for Macintosh Plus or later
with at least 1 megabyte RAM (for monochrome) or 2 megabytes for color; a hard
disk or two 800K floppy disk drives; and System 6.0 or later. $49.95 ($119.95
for a School Lab Pack). From Broderbund Software, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael,
CA 94903-2101. (415) 492-3200.; Summary: Kid Pix is a colorful painting
program for kids or adults with lots of strange and fun painting tools
(dynamite erasures, electric mixers) and lots of wacky sounds. For kids, it is
the most captivating program I've seen in years. For adults, it can be a lot
of fun and also should be a reminder that we aren't squeezing enough
innovation into most of our programs, for fun and business. Too many programs
are busy piling up features and porting to Windows but ignoring the vast
possibilities for new media, tools and approaches to computing.; On a scale of
one to four, with one indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's
how the product rates:; Performance: 4 computers; Ease of use: 4 computers;
