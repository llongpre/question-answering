<DESCRIPT>  SOFTWARE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ONE OF THE most anticipated programs for the Macintosh computer in the last
few years was HyperCard 2.0, the first major revision to a futuristic piece of
software that has been bundled free with every Macintosh sold since 1987.;   
By the time it arrived, HyperCard 2.0 had actually become two offerings: one,
a stripped-down version supplied free with every new Macintosh, and the
full-featured $195 version offered by Apple's software subsidiary, Claris
Corp. ((408) 727-8227). In both cases, HyperCard 2.0 is a mixed bag.
Admittedly it is both very important and a definite improvement over the
original HyperCard. But the upgrade is also a bit disappointing and fairly
boring.  </LEADPARA>

STRAIGHT (publ. 4/2/91, pg. 6E);  Because of a writer's error, the upgrade

<TEXT>     HyperCard is a key piece of software on the Macintosh. When it first
appeared, Apple was casting about for some way to keep the Mac ahead of PC
clones running Windows. HyperCard looked like just the ticket because in some
ways it was even easier to use than the Mac's regular "interface" of menus and
icons.;    As essentially an extension to the Mac's operating system -- just
as Windows is an extension of the PC's DOS operating system -- HyperCard lets
ordinary users create programs, which are called "stacks" to sound more
friendly. HyperCard has its own "scripting" language to make stacks, called
HyperTalk. Whatever sort of program you made would center on HyperCard's
simple "card" display on the Mac screen, where small pictures represented
programs and commands, and you needed only to point the mouse cursor at a
selection and click the mouse button once to activate that selection.;   
HyperCard could easily link one small image or bit of text to another on
another "card" (page of information in HyperCard) -- a "hypertext" style
function that was the origin of its name. HyperTalk can also reach out and
control programs and hardware "external" to HyperCard.;    Apple envisioned
individuals using HyperCard to customize their computing world. However,
although many individuals did employ HyperCard, a surprising number of large
corporations and software developers also adopted it. Hard-pressed corporate
MIS (management information systems) people, attempting to keep up with
constant demands for special programs for their companies, discovered
HyperCard and HyperTalk.;    Recently, HyperCard has been important to
"multimedia" work because its scripting language can hold together images,
text and information from peripherals such as video players.;    The
improvements are all for those who program or "script" with HyperCard, not
those who use those scripts and stacks. The new HyperCard can work with
variable-sized cards (the old ones were all the same size), can open several
windows at once (instead of only one), can style text (making it bold, italic
and so on), and has more commands for printing, painting (there has always
been a tiny graphics program built in) and creating icons (the tiny images
that represent commands and programs).;    The HyperTalk scripting language
has lots of added commands and options to do things such as give you more
control of menus in programs you create. There's an improved editor for
creating and changing scripts and a debugger for finding problems in them.;   
All of these changes now allow you to create HyperCard stacks that don't look
automatically like they are running in HyperCard -- they look more like
regular Macintosh programs.;    So why is HyperCard 2.0 a bit disappointing?; 
  First, because it took four years to move from version 1.0 to 2.0. That's
too long for an upgrade to any important program, much less to one that is
supposedly central to the future of the Mac.;    Another important reason is
that HyperCard still doesn't support color. Although it can display color
images, it doesn't give you any color graphics or text tools. That's a sin for
a program that is vital to multimedia.;    Worst of all, because of the
changes, HyperCard 2.0 is not thoroughly compatible with HyperCard 1.0. That's
a pity, although it leaves an opening for some HyperCard competitor that can
promise both more power and compatibility.;    Finally, why fairly boring?
Because most of its changes are of interest only to program developers, not
users.;    HyperCard 2.0 is also boring because there was so much news about
Claris, Apple and the HyperCard marketing scheme in 1990 that having the
actual program now seems anti-climactic. Apple talked about selling the new
HyperCard instead of just providing it for free as before. Big Furor. Then
Apple swallowed Claris Corp. -- it's one-time software spinoff. Big Furor II.
Then Claris was going to sell a full-blown HyperCard and give away for free a
crippled HyperCard. Big Furor III. Too many Big Furors equals boring to me,
especially if the program they concern isn't all that new, different or
revolutionary.;    What finally settled out is that you'll be able to get
HyperCard 2.0 for free along with any new HyperCard-based stacks you might
buy, upgrade to or pick up from a users group. You can opt for the Claris
upgrade kit from 1.0 for $495, and you'll get HyperCard 2.0 plus a bunch of
example stacks plus a hefty scripting manual and the right to call Claris for
technical support. Finally you can pay a full $195 for the Claris development
kit to get a bunch more manuals.;    For those familiar with HyperCard who
mainly use it to run stacks, the free upgrades will be a great value. For
those who program with HyperCard, the upgrade kit is all you'll need. The
development kit is really only for those who need a thorough HyperCard
education and prefer the fairly expensive Claris documents to whatever
HyperCard 2.0 books may appear from other publishers.; HyperCard 2.0, for
Apple Macintosh Plus or later. Free when bundled with other companies'
HyperCard-based products; $49 upgrade from HyperCard 1.0 includes stacks,
manuals, and support from Claris; $195 Development Package from Claris
includes upgrade stacks, manuals, and support and adds more manuals. From
Claris Corp., 5201 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95052-8168. (408)
727-8227) (800) 628-2100.; Summary: HyperCard 2.0 adds a number of scripting
commands and features that will please those who create programs and
interfaces with this popular Macintosh software. It does not support color,
nor does it offer complete compatibility with HyperCard 1.0, but it does
retain the simple use and speed that made HyperCard famous for presentation
and education, multimedia and quick program prototyping.; On a scale of one to
four, with one indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how the
product rates:; Performance: 3 computers; Ease of use: 4 computers; Value (for
bundled versions or upgrade): 3 computers  </TEXT>
