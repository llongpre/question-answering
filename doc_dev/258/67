<TEXT>     Harvard Graphics 3.0 (Software Publishing, $595, (800) 336-8360) has long
been best for working with lots of numbers and data. It performs complex math
on the data before turning it into neat charts and graphs. You enter the
numbers or suck them in from some spreadsheet (a new feature lets you select
them directly from a spreadsheet file), and Harvard automatically creates,
sizes and labels any of a dozen chart types from them, including 3-D charts.; 
  Harvard also packs a complete drawing program, if you want to add your own
lines, curves and colors to those charts. The new version brings the drawing
commands right in with the others. It also adds more commands, including
something called "evolve" for a crude step-by-step animation of an image
across the screen. There's also more use of color, with shaded backgrounds,
color mixing and chart templates.;    It has always been easy to make "text
charts" in Harvard, just choosing the chart type from a menu. But 3.0 includes
Bitstream's Speedo "scalable fonts." That means it can make sharp and clear
text characters at almost any size, including the text that labels graphic
charts.;    Scalable fonts are more important in presentations than anywhere
else. Where else will people be staring at a few letters or words, possibly
magnified to fill a wall-size screen, for several minutes? An "auto-build"
feature makes it easy to create a sequence of text slides.;    Presentation
graphics programs can generally show their works on the computer screen, as a
series of "slides" with special-effects transitions between the images. The
most advanced give the speaker control of the timing and add audio effects.
Harvard's screen show offers a dozen special effects and a "hypertext" feature
for hiding more information behind images. Unfortunately, it only runs in EGA
mode, not using the best resolution of a powerful graphics adapter.;    And
Harvard doesn't let you organize all the images of a screen show as tiny
"thumbnail" images on screen, nor does it automatically collect them into a
single disk file for easy copying and backing up.;    Freelance Graphics for
DOS (Lotus, $495, (617) 577-8500) has menus that resemble those in Lotus'
popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. Freelance makes a neat partner with 1-2-3,
taking data from it for the charts. The OS/2 version of Freelance does even
more of this.;    For text charts, Freelance has an outliner -- to let you
organize your ideas -- but that outliner and its spelling checker are a
separate program, not a fully integrated part of Freelance.;    For drawing,
Freelance offers only basic commands, such as lines, arrows, rectangles,
polygons, circles and freehand sketching. It's too bad Freelance can only show
12 colors at a time. It does have the unique ability to place small data
tables beneath the relevant elements in a chart. The program also comes with a
large library of clip art on disk, nearly 1,000 images, which you may add to
charts.;    One of the parts of Freelance I like best is the "Smart Features."
These start with predesigned, artistically correct chart templates. The smarts
continue with "Smart Chart Composition," which automatically positions and
sizes charts to fit within the area you're using, for the output device you're
planning to use (slide, overhead, printed page), moving and sizing headings,
and labels so they don't run off edges. And this new Freelance adds the
Bitstream fonts for smooth text on screen and page.;    Freelance can run a
"screen show" of its charts, offering more than a dozen special transition
effects and a stand-alone module to run the shows without having the full
Freelance program at hand. Organizing such a show is easier with Freelance
than with Harvard because of Freelance's portfolio feature for collecting
charts and related files into one set.;    I don't like that Freelance still
makes you choose your charts from a text-only menu, instead of from small
pictures. Also, Freelance still offers fewer output file formats (for moving
charts to other programs) than the competing programs. And I'm definitely not
thrilled that the technical support lasts only six months, giving way to a
900-number you'll have to pay to use.;    Hollywood (IBM, $495, (800)
IBM-7699) runs under Windows, so it needs more hardware power than either
Harvard or Freelance. But the Windows foundation also means Hollywood can be
easier to use, especially for editing graphics and organizing screen shows.;  
 Although Hollywood doesn't have some of the wonderful features of the other
programs, it has several things I think are vital in a presentation package.
One is a built-in outliner (for organizing your thoughts, instantly converting
them into text charts and then quickly reorganizing them later). You may
import text from a word processor or spreadsheet to this outliner, apply some
templates (using any of six text chart types) and have a presentation in no
time. Hollywood also has scalable fonts and lets you distort them in all sorts
of ways -- even running them vertically. It uses the same Bitstream fonts as
Harvard and Freelance.;    Another practical text-chart feature is "layering"
that helps you add one item at a time to a chart, then dim that item as the
next item appears. This is called "build and subdue" and is a basic part of a
complete presentation diet.;    The thumbnail image I missed in Harvard and
Freelance shows up here, for organizing your final screen show. It's called a
slide sorter. There are plenty of special effects for screen-show transitions
and an independent screen-show module.;    Hollywood can import spreadsheet
numbers for creating charts. And for customizing those charts, the drawing
commands include Bezier curves, rulers, and grids with "snapping" (for precise
positioning). There's only a small amount of clip art on the disk -- about 100
images. Hollywood is a slick producer of 3-D effects and color gradients.;   
So how do you choose among these presentation packages? None has all of the
features I'd like to see, and the competition will change when the Windows
versions of Harvard and Freelance appear this fall.;    For now though,
Harvard is the best if your charts involve many numbers and calculations. I
also think it is the simplest of the three to learn. Freelance could be the
best if you're a confirmed 1-2-3 addict and want the artistic assistance of
the Smart Charts feature, or if you also work with OS/2 and want a program
that runs in both operating systems. Hollywood shines when it comes to
organizing and reorganizing sequences of charts, with its layering, outliner
and thumbnail-slide sorter.;  Freelance Graphics for DOS 4.0, for PC or
compatible with at least 640K memory, hard disk, DOS 3.0 or later and graphics
display. $495. From Lotus Development Corp., 55 Cambridge Parkway, Cambridge,
MA 02142. (617) 577-8500.;    Harvard Graphics 3.0, for PC or compatible with
at least 640K memory, a high-density floppy disk drive, a hard disk and a
graphics adapter. $595. From Software Publishing Corp., P.O. Box 7210, 1901
Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94039-7210. (800) 336-8360.;    Hollywood
1.0, for PC or compatible running Windows 3.0. $495. From IBM Desktop
Software, P.O. Box 2150, Atlanta, GA 30301-2150. (800)-IBM-7699.;    Summary:
Not one of these three presentation graphics programs has all of the features
I'd like to see. For now, Harvard is the simplest to learn and the best if
your charts involve lots of numbers and calculations, but it doesn't show your
charts as you make them and lacks an outliner. Freelance could be the best if
you're building charts from 1-2-3 spreadsheet data or if you also work with
OS/2. But Freelance has limited color abilities and an awkward connection to
its spelling checker and outliner. Hollywood is a Windows program that shines
in organizing and reorganizing sequences of charts. But Hollywood needs more
processor and memory than the others do and does not have the numeric
strengths of Harvard nor the tight 1-2-3 links of Freelance.;    On a scale of
one to four, with one indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's
how the product rates:; Freelance Graphics;    Performance: 2 computers;   
Ease of use: 2 computers;    Value: 2 computers; Harvard Graphics 3.0;   
Performance: 2 computers;    Ease of use: 2 computers;    Value: 2 computers;
Hollywood 1.0;    Performance: 3 computers;    Ease of use: 3 computers;   
Value: 3 computers  </TEXT>
