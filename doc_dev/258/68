<LEADPARA>  Personal computers have enabled millions of Americans to operate businesses
out of their homes. According to recent market surveys, about 20 million
people will earn all or part of their household income from a home-based
business next year.;    Finding the right computer at the right price is a
goal of most of these workers. Link Resources Inc., a market research company
in New York that tracks the home office market, found that home office workers
spent an average of $1,830 for their latest computer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Given that amount as a target, we recently set out to find the best home
office computer. No one computer can really be said to be the best, simply
because the needs of home office workers vary so widely, but we looked for one
that offered good value, high performance, ease of use and good technical
support.;    No backup computer;    A home office worker typically has no
backup computer and no technical support staff, so if the computer goes down
for any length of time, so does the business.;    With that in mind, we chose
two very different computers for consideration: the Dell 316SX and the Apple
Macintosh Classic 2/40.;    For $1,699, the Dell 316SX offers good performance
and a fairly long life expectancy because it is capable of running Windows.;  
 It is based on the 16-megahertz version of the Intel 386SX microprocessor,
and it comes with 2 megabytes of system memory, a 40-megabyte hard disk drive,
a choice of either a 3 1/2-inch or 5 1/4-inch diskette drive, a VGA-level
color monitor, a keyboard, a Microsoft mouse and both the DOS operating system
software and the Windows 3.0 graphic system software loaded onto the hard
disk.;    Dell offers as an option a 2,400-baud modem, plus ProComm
communications software, for an extra $99, taking the system price to $1,798.;
   Warranty tips scales to Dell;    There are comparable computers available
for slightly less money, but the selling factor for us was Dell's return
policy and one-year, on-site service warranty.;    Basically, one can return
the computer within 30 days, for any reason, for a full refund. After that, if
anything goes wrong that cannot be fixed by telephone support, Dell will
dispatch a technician to fix the computer in the user's office (or home
office). There is no charge for parts or labor in the first year.;    Dell
Computer Corp. of Austin, Texas ((800) 626-4294), sells most of its computers
directly to customers, although CompUSA has the retail franchise.;    Dell
recently placed first in the J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction
poll of small and medium-size computer businesses, and Apple Computer Inc.
finished second.;    Apple's high showing in customer satisfaction is notable
because the company relies heavily on dealers for service and support.;   
Also, the Macintosh family of computers is easier to use than computers using
DOS or Windows. All Macintosh software uses essentially the same command
structure, which means that once the user is familiar with one program, it is
relatively easy to figure out all the others.;    At least, it is easier than
on the DOS or Windows machines, where each application may have a different
command structure.;    From a technical standpoint, the $1,495 Macintosh
Classic 2/40 is underpowered. It uses a relatively old and slow processor, the
Motorola 68000 running at 8 megahertz, and it has a small black-and-white
screen.;    On the other hand, it does more with those humble attributes than
most IBM Personal Computer-compatible machines in that price range (one can
usually get a 25 percent to 30 percent discount at a dealer, more if the buyer
is a student or teacher at an accredited college).;    Also, the Mac takes up
very little desk space, and space is often at a premium in home offices.;   
The Mac Classic 2/40, with 2 megabytes of memory and a 40-megabyte hard disk,
is quite capable of running the standard business applications needed by a
home-based business.;    It will also capture the imaginations of younger
members of the household, which is great if the office computer is not
off-limits.  </TEXT>
