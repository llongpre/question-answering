   WILSONVILLE, Ore. -- Tektronix Inc. said it joined Adobe
Systems Inc. in cross-licensing software for use in color
computer printers.
   The agreement gives Tektronix the right to use Adobe's
PostScript Level 2 technology, an upgraded version of its
popular main product. Adobe will license various Tektronix
patents, including one that enables users to match colors on
paper with those on a computer's screen.

   A spokesman for Tektronix said its first printer with the
upgraded PostScript software would not be available until
September. The software makes the printer compatible with
most personal computers and allows it to print data that is
stored in a computer's memory in compressed form.
