<P>
Apple Computer Inc., in an aggressive but overdue effort to stem a decline in 
market share, launched a new line of computers Monday that cuts the price of 
the flagship Macintosh in half and fundamentally alters the company's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate introduction ceremony, featuring live satellite links with 
Berlin, Singapore and a number of U.S. locations, took place at Apple's factory 
in Fremont, emphasizing the company's intention to transform itself into a 
high-volume, low-cost manufacturer of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
The new strategy has been described by Apple Chairman and Chief Executive John 
A. Sculley as the outgrowth of a complete re-evaluation of how Apple will 
compete in the volatile personal computer business. Although the Macintosh is 
widely recognized as being easier to use than competing IBM-compatible personal 
computers, it has also been far more expensive -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple must increase its market share 
beyond the estimated 10% that it now holds if it is to be more than a niche 
player in a market dominated by IBM-compatible machines that use the DOS 
operating system. That challenge has been sharpened by the success of 
Microsoft's Windows 3 software, which gives DOS machines many of the 
easy-to-use features that made the Macintosh a success. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts have praised the new products, whose basic characteristics have 
been widely known for months, although Wall Street has been uncomfortable with 
the expected reduction in Apple's profit margins that will come with the 
low-priced products. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous product announcement, though I don't know why they didn't 
do it a year ago," said David Wu, a computer analyst with S. G. Warburg &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley emphasized that Apple did not simply cut prices of existing machines, 
but rather redesigned them to reduce cost and increase performance. And though 
he said the economy was already in a recession, he nonetheless maintained that 
businesses and consumers would continue to buy productivity-enhancing 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
The new Apple machines include: 
</P>
<P>
* The Macintosh Classic, an entry-level computer priced at $999 with one 
megabyte of memory and a floppy-disk drive, or $1,499 with two megabytes of 
memory and a 40-megabyte hard-disk drive. The Classic, available immediately, 
is equivalent to the Macintosh SE, which will be discontinued, as will the 
Macintosh Plus. 
</P>
<P>
* The Macintosh LC, a color computer that has a small, pizza-box-like shape 
with a separate monitor. It comes with a 40-megabyte hard-disk drive and a new 
sound-editing system that allows voice or other sound to be attached to files 
and edited. The LC, which will not be available in volume until February, will 
sell for $2,499 without a monitor. A special card that will allow the machine 
to run Apple II software will cost $199. 
</P>
<P>
* The Macintosh IIsi, a high-performance color machine that uses the fast 68030 
microprocessor from Motorola. The IIsi is faster and has better expansion 
capabilities than the LC, and includes the new sound-editing system. It is also 
available now, at a price of $3,769 in a basic configuration that includes two 
megabytes of memory and a 40-megabyte hard disk. It replaces the existing Mac 
IIcx. 
</P>
<P>
All the products are expected to sell at "street prices" up to 20% below the 
listed price. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley said the new machines had been brought to market even more quickly than 
Apple had originally planned, and that the company would have plenty of the 
Macintosh Classics on hand for the Christmas season. But the limited 
availability of the LC, considered by some analysts the most important of the 
new products, could make it harder for Apple to build momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The LC is the key to Apple's efforts to win back the education market, which it 
once dominated with the Apple II but has lately lost to IBM-compatible 
machines. One of the new television advertisements that are part of a 
$40-million marketing campaign features a teacher giving a roomful of 
LC-equipped students an inspirational lecture on the value of production and 
productivity.
