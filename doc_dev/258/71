<LEADPARA>  I NEED a good PIM. I need a quick, easy and portable Personal Information
Manager program. A lot of other people do, too. They need software that will
keep track of their schedules, telephone calls, expenses, to-do lists and
random notes. I think PIMs could become the next major software category,
after word processors, spreadsheets, data bases and graphics.;   But then,
I've thought that for years now, and PIMs are still just one more interesting
niche in software.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Why? What's so hard about making a PIM?;   Well, making it fast and easy
isn't easy. Putting lots of help into a program means eating up more memory
and operating slower. Making it work for everyone -- when we've all built up
different schemes for organizing our lives -- is tough, too. And when I add a
feature you want and a feature he wants and a feature she wants, I slow all
those features down for everyone.;   But toughest, probably, is making it
portable. A PIM must compete with the pencil-and-paper organizer books that
business people use everywhere. And it must compete with those pocket
organizers -- such as the Sharp Wizard and the Casio Boss -- that store phone
numbers and notes. Until the latest notebook computers appeared, PIMs had
limited appeal, appearing practical only for those who spent all day in a
single place -- where a 12- to 40-pound computer wasn't a ball and chain to
lug about.;   Now you can do all those personal information things with a word
processor or simple data base. You can create sections for calls, schedule,
to-do and expenses. You can use the sorting features of either program to
organize those sections and make up your own rules for linking information in
one area to information in another (such as linking current calls to your
directory list of phone numbers).;   But believe me, such gum-and-baling wire
schemes just aren't handy. Any notes you keep about phone calls start
cluttering your list of calls to make. Schedules you make aren't automatically
updated. Want to reconcile those schedules with other people's schedules on a
network? Forget it. You'll miss all your meetings because you'll be busy
programming your schedule maker. Besides, most word processors or data bases
take too long to start and stop, so they aren't handy when you receive a call
or need to make a quick note.;   I just looked at a new PIM from a fellow
who's been studying the PIM art for years: Connections from Danny Goodman.
Connections (Concentrix Technology, $199, (415) 358-8600) is a Macintosh
program and is built around HyperCard. That's no surprise: Goodman is a
HyperCard expert and used the HyperCard programming language to build one of
his previous PIMs -- Focal Point.;   Connections is better than Focal Point.
It is one of the best PIMs I've seen. Installation is pretty automatic.;  
Connections offers lots of important and export abilities to pull in records
you kept in other PIMs or data bases (such as FileMaker, Focal Point II or
standard data-base files). And it runs under System 6.0 or 7.0, even using
System 7.0 powers to instantly update your schedule with other schedules on
the same network.;   When you start Connections, you see a list of current
to-do items and reminders, a list of telephone calls and the day's appointment
list (with a graphic chart of the times and durations of each item).;   You
may click on the to-do list to enter a new item or reminder, to set a priority
or indicate that an item is done, or to sort items. Alarms you set can beep or
use a built-in voice to speak the reminder when the time comes around.;   You
click on the telephone list to record making or receiving a call. You can
start and stop the timer to see how long the call was, and you can keep notes
of what was said. (Someday PIMs will include voice recognition and automatic
note-taking.);   You can leap to a directory display that keeps addresses and
phone numbers and can auto-dial numbers (using an attached modem to beep the
phone or just using the Mac's speaker).;   You click on the appointment list
to change times for activities or to check on details for a particular
activity. (I especially like how the monthly calendar summarizes how busy each
day is by coloring them with small light-gray, dark-gray or black squares.)
There's also a Quick Note module that lets you type something and save it on
its own page.;   You can print reports, calendars, phone lists and other paper
results.;   Connections gets its name from the ability to link information
within your lists and schedules. You may create explicit links between lists,
calls or quick notes. The program can automatically address a letter or
envelope from your directory information. The program can also turn a phone
call into a to-do item linked to a directory card.;   But the most important
connection coordinates your appointment list with those of other Connections
users on the network. From two to 30 Connections users can see the schedules
of other users on the same net and can be instantly notified of changes to
those schedules.;   Connections also can reconcile your own multiple
schedules, such as one you keep on a portable Macintosh and one on your
desk-top Macintosh in the office.;   Connections has lots of fine features and
abilities. If you're a HyperCard pro, you can customize the Connections
program to your own needs. And a price of $199 isn't bad: That probably means
about $129 at discount.;   But I'm not moving to Connections for now.;   With
its menus, icons and modules, it is more complex than I want for my quick
note-taker. And although HyperCard may make it easy in some ways -- with
single clicking to find or enter information -- it also takes a lot of memory.
My Mac Portable couldn't even run Connections: 2 megabytes of RAM wasn't
enough to keep it from crashing. What little I was able to see on the Mac
Portable was so slow that I couldn't depend on it.;   Even on a IIfx with 8
megabytes, I found myself waiting for Connections to respond.;   I need a PIM
to be faster than any other program: ready for my calls and notes now. On a
fast Mac on a network or on one of the new Mac notebooks with 4 megabytes of
memory, I might be tempted. For now, I'm sticking to pen and paper.;
Connections for Macintosh. $199 (or $149 through December from Heizer
Software, (800) 888-7667. From Concentrix Technology Inc., 1875 S. Grant St.,
Suite 760, San Mateo, CA 94402. (415) 358-8600.; Summary: Connections is a
Personal Information Manager for the Macintosh. It helps you keep and organize
a to-do list, a schedule for appointments and reminders and a telephone call
log. It also keeps a phone/address directory and any quick notes you want to
type. Connections can link and sort these various lists and can even share the
schedule with other Connections users on a network. It automates many aspects
of personal information handling and comes closer than most PIMs to being a
practical replacement for the paper organizer notebook. However, it is more
complex to learn than I would like and demands lots of RAM (4 megabytes) and
processor speed to be practical.; On a scale of one to four, with one
indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:;
