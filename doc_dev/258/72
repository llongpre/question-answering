Microsoft's Windows 3.0, unveiled Tuesday, may turn out to be the most 
significant development in the nine-year history of IBM and compatible personal 
computers. The software, which works with the MS-DOS operating system, makes it 
possible for millions of those machines to use an attractive graphical 
interface similar to that on the Apple Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0, with a suggested list price of $149, is neither a program nor an 
operating system. It is an operating environment. As such, it governs the look 
of the screen, the way users interact with programs and even the way programs 
operate. It runs under the regular MS-DOS operating system on any IBM 
compatible with an Intel 286, 386 or 486 central processing unit. Machines must 
also have a hard disk, a graphic display and at least 1 megabyte of memory. 
Although Windows will work with regular MS-DOS programs, it works best when 
used with software designed especially for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0 has four primary advantages over regular MS-DOS. First, all 
programs written for Windows have a similar look and feel. Once you learn how 
to use one Windows program, you have a head start on the others. Second, the 
graphical environment assures that programs operate in a "what you see is what 
you get" mode so that what you see on the screen looks like what you'll get on 
paper. Third, Windows, as does the Mac, makes it easy to transfer data from one 
program to another. It's as simple as highlighting the information with the 
mouse, copying it to the clipboard and pasting it in another program. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Windows 3.0 is a multi-tasking operating environment. That means it's 
possible to load several programs into the computer's memory and switch between 
them with a single command or mouse movement. You can even have several 
programs share the screen, each in its own window. As I write this article, I 
am simultaneously transmitting data to another computer. What's more, my 
spreadsheet and drawing programs are in memory so that I can switch to them in 
less than a second without having to stop what I'm doing. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0 can take advantage of up to 16 megabytes of memory. Regular MS-DOS 
programs can use only 640K. I'm not suggesting you buy that much memory for 
your system, but the more memory you have, the more programs you can run at one 
time. Extra memory also increases performance in some situations. 
</P>
<P>
Users whose machines are equipped with an Intel 386 or 486 CPU will be able to 
use Windows to run several DOS or Windows applications in the background, with 
each program behaving as if it's running in its own dedicated PC. It's also 
possible for 386 users to allocate part of their hard disk to simulate random 
access memory. This so-called virtual memory allows the 386 to continue to run 
programs even after you've run out of regular memory. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt if anyone but a software reviewer would do this, but as a test, I used 
Windows on an 8-megabyte 386 to run WordPerfect, WordStar, Microsoft Word, 
Lotus 1-2-3, Prodigy, Quattro, Word for Windows, Excel, Microphone II and 
several other Windows and non-Windows programs -- all at the same time. Each 
behaved perfectly. The only program I couldn't run was the one that controls my 
compact disc drive. Ironically, that software was developed by Microsoft -- the 
same company that developed Windows. 
</P>
<P>
You can't run Windows 3.0 on a PC or PC/XT equipped with an Intel 8088 or 8086 
CPU. However, most of those machines can be modified with faster CPUs. 
</P>
<P>
If you buy Windows you should also count on buying new Windows-compatible 
software. It's possible to use your old software, but the programs will look 
and operate just like they always have. They will not offer Windows' graphical 
user interface, although you will be able to use Windows to copy and paste 
information between regular DOS programs or between DOS and Windows programs. 
Some programs written to run under previous versions of Windows must be 
modified before they can run properly with the new version. 
</P>
<P>
Windows 3.0 comes with several free programs to get you started, including a 
basic word-processing program, a calculator, a couple of games, a reasonably 
good communications program and a personal organizer, called Daybook. Daybook 
includes a place for your schedule, address book and "to do" list. 
</P>

Early versions of Windows were criticized as being slow and ugly. What's more, 
there has been a dearth of software. The new Windows is a lot faster and a lot 
prettier. I've been using a prerelease copy for about a month and I'm extremely 
impressed with its features, performance and reliability. I didn't get out my 
stop watch to perform any timing tests, but its performance on my 386-based PC 
seems at least as good as what I'm getting on a similarly equipped Macintosh 
IIci -- a machine with a street price that's more than twice the cost of my PC. 
I was pleasantly surprised at how well Windows performed on a minimal 
configuration when I tested it on a machine with a 286 CPU and 1 megabyte of 
random-access memory. If you shop around you can find such machines, equipped 
with a hard disk and a high-resolution color monitor, for about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft and other software companies are rushing to provide software to run 
under Windows. Microsoft has already released Windows versions of its 
spreadsheet (Excel) and word processing (Word) software. Software Ventures has 
announced a forthcoming version of its Microphone Communications software, and 
WordPerfect Corp. is working on a Windows version of its best-selling word 
processing program. hDC Computer Corp. of Redmond, Wash., has released some 
very good utilities programs for Windows, including one that makes it easier to 
locate and run programs. Asymetrix, of Bellevue, Wash., has already released 
ToolBook, a software development tool that is somewhat similar to Apple's 
HyperCard language.

In an effort to add value to its systems and simplify the lives of its dealers 
and customers, Zenith Data Systems is loading Windows 3.0 along with ToolBox 
and DOS 4.0 on the hard disks of all its 286 and 386 desktop machines. Zenith 
is also including a mouse as standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith, along with Microsoft, commissioned a study that concluded that 
graphical user interfaces such as Windows and Macintosh cause users to work 
faster and better and achieve higher productivity and lower frustration than 
those using a regular, non-graphical interface. 
</P>
<P>
Novice users of a graphics-based system completed 42% more tasks than novice 
users of a non-graphics system, according to the study conducted by the 
research firm Temple, Baker &amp; Sloane. Experienced users were 35% more 
productive, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The new version of Windows is an exciting and important development, bringing 
many advantages of the Apple Macintosh to lower-priced IBM compatibles. It 
breathes new life into the old MS-DOS operating system and has turned me into a 
born-again DOS user.
