<LEADPARA>  Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday that it will include special typeface
software from Adobe Systems Inc. in future releases of its Macintosh operating
system.;   An spokeswoman for Mountain View-based Adobe said the agreement
means Macintosh customers will soon be able to use any of the 10,000 fonts
sold by a dozen companies without having to buy a separate program, called
Adobe Type Manager, as they do now.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IN SIGN OF MENDED RIFT, APPLE TO USE ADOBE
TYPEFACE SOFTWARE IN THE MAC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Just as significantly, said Bob Fennell, an analyst at Dataquest Inc. in
San Jose, the agreement shows the extent to which Apple and Adobe have mended
their relationship after a well-publicized rift two years ago that threatened
to wreck Adobe's business.;   The two companies said Tuesday they had signed a
letter of intent to include Adobe's "Type 1 rasterizer," which draws typefaces
on the computer screen, as well as some Adobe fonts, in upcoming releases of
Apple's System 7 software. Financial details between the firms have yet to be
worked out, Adobe said.;   Cupertino-based Apple said it will continue to
support its own rival system, but Fennell said he expected Adobe's system to
become the dominant one.;   While the news was seen as good for Adobe, the
company's shares nonetheless fell $1.50 to $48.75 in Over-the-Counter trading.
That drop was attributed to investor concern about a recent warning from
Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Also, a big Adobe customer, that its printer
business was slowing.;   While Apple has used Adobe's Postscript since
introducing its laser printer, the relationship between the two firms was
sorely strained in 1989 when Apple said it would team up with Microsoft Corp.
of Redmond, Wash., and develop a Postscript alternative. But sales of that
system, called Truetype, have been slower than expected, and Apple and Adobe
are once more seen as partners.  </TEXT>
