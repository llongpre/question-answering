lifts desktop publishing systems - DTP, new software products for a maturing
market

INNOVATIVE software producers are giving a lift to the maturing market for
desktop publishing systems.
Publishers of larger magazines and newspapers may once have only considered
buying, say, a dedicated newspaper production system from one of the leading
suppliers, such as Atex or Systems Integrators (SII) of the US, or N. D.
Comtec, a division of Norsk Data of Norway.
However, publications across Europe and the US are produced on Apple
Macintosh's range, for example, using standard or enhanced software packages
from Quark (X-Press) or Aldus (PageMaker), which started life as suppliers
of desktop publishing software.
These advanced software products operate on the standard DTP 'platforms,'
such as IBM's PC, the Mac or other computers that can be bought 'off the
shelf' to produce a wide range of magazines and newspapers.
The Spanish newspaper, El Sol, in Madrid is just one example of a large
circulation daily paper produced on a Mac system, using software from Quark
X-Press.
'Many of the most innovative of these newspaper and magazine software
systems are produced in the UK - they achieve great results on what,
initially, were desktop platforms,' says Ms Laurel Brunner of Seybold, the
independent information resource group for publishing technology.*
Among these new UK software systems which operate on the Mac are those from
DPS Typecraft; Talbot of Bournemouth, and QED of Cheltenham.
Meanwhile, across the DTP industry, the Dollars 1.83bn European market is
the biggest in the world, and set to continue growing as technology has
brought 500 years of graphic communications techniques to the computer
industry.
Sales of Dollars 3.9bn are forecast by 1994 - by then, there will more than
97,000 new desktop publishing installations up-and-running in Europe, with
at least 18,000 of them located in this country, according to a report from
Frost and Sullivan, the leading market research group.**
But the rate of growth is likely to slow after 1992, as software and
scanning input devices take an increasing share of sales from hardware and
new DTP systems. While most DTP software programmes are English-based,
companies such as Apple and Adobe have tackled the language problem, with
increasing sales in non-English speaking countries.
Several leading Arabic newspapers and magazines are prepared in London on
Apple Mac systems using Diwan software. They include such daily broadsheet
newspapers as Sharq al-Awsat, Al-Hayat and Sawt al-Kuwait which are produced
in London and transmitted electronically to the Middle East for printing.
Because a large proportion of software comes from the US, many packages are
English-based, and the UK is - and will remain - the largest market in
Europe for DTP installations, with sales reaching Dollars 737m in 1994.
A typical DTP system includes a personal computer, a high resolution
monitor; a 'mouse' or other hand-controlled digitiser for positioning text
and graphics; plus software for word processing, graphics and
page-composition; and a laser printer. DTP systems, which may or may not be
networked, are generally at the low end of a larger market for electronic
publishing systems.
Colour continues to be a big topic in the DTP world - as systems move on
from basic monochrome to colour, the biggest issue is how users can achieve
colour-tone consistency across various computer screens, proof printers and
presses - a facility which is especially important to advertising agencies,
for example.
Innovation abounds in all areas of the market, with higher performance PCs
and new software packages. For example, the processing speed of Postscript,
the page-description language from Adobe, has been significantly enhanced in
the past year as somputer speeds have increased.
Vendors of proprietory hardware for professional publishing systems are also
'porting' software on to the Macintosh platform.
Apple has announced a new operating system, called System 7, which give a
new environment for many applications, particularly publishing.
One of these new enhancements is called 'Publish and Subscribe' which allows
users on a DTP network to call up 'live' material, such as text, artwork or
up-to-the-minute price lists.
In the European market for DT systems, analysts expect an upsurge in demand
in a number of application areas, particularly the production of magazines,
advertising literature and public consumption information. Scanning - and
particularly the input of higher definition with greater grey-scale and
colour - is expected to push up the cost of scanners and attendant software.
Sales of core hardware, personal computers and printers in Europe could be
worth almost Dollars 1.3bn by 1994.
