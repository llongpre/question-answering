<LEADPARA>  QUATTRO PRO 2.0 (Borland, $495) is a decent improvement to one of the best
personal computer spreadsheets on the market. It is still an excellent
alternative to Lotus 1-2-3 for any PC user and is a superior choice for many.
And as long as Borland keeps offering it as a $99.95 upgrade from any
competing spreadsheet, Quattro is sure to keep conquering more of the
spreadsheet market. We could be watching a sea change in one of the largest
software categories.;    One or two programs dominate each software category.
But as solid as today's rankings may seem, they are not set in concrete.
Champions sometimes crash, and challengers take their places. It doesn't
happen often, but after it does it can be difficult to remember that the new
king was once only a prince or a pauper.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Lotus 1-2-3 has been the leading spreadsheet since it stole the crown from
VisiCalc in the early '80s. But it lost the battle for the Macintosh -- where
Microsoft's Excel took charge -- and is now in a serious battle with Quattro
Pro and Excel on the PC. It isn't even available for Windows, where Excel is
the leader, and is losing market share quickly to Quattro Pro on PCs not
running Windows. Lotus still dominates the PC market but less so than ever
before.;    So how does a program slip?;    Two reasons: the drag of the
installed base and company mistakes. Just as a large installed base is an
advantage to a program, it can also be a disadvantage. If your company makes a
living from the people who've learned to use a certain version of your
program, there's a great incentive to cater to those people. (This happens in
computer hardware, too.) Any new versions must be compatible with the previous
versions, offer similar menus and commands, and handle the files from previous
versions. That limits what your programmers can do with the new version.;   
Mistakes come in many forms. There's arrogance: Some companies assume they
have some natural right to lead the pack and don't work hard at remaining in
front. They aren't quick enough to improve their software, or they skimp on
technical support and customer help. There's shortsightedness: Some firms
don't realize a new computer or software structure is the wave of the future
and don't prepare for it.;    Lotus, home of 1-2-3, has been guilty of quite a
few mistakes in the past but seems to be turning its own tide since the middle
of last year, perhaps because of the threat from Excel and Quattro.;    Excel
is the Windows spreadsheet of choice because it is powerful, it comes from the
people who make Windows (Microsoft) and there isn't much competition (no 1-2-3
or Quattro for Windows yet). But Windows and Excel require several megabytes
of random-access memory, a 386 processor and a VGA graphics adapter for decent
performance. And Excel is not able to handle 1-2-3 commands, macros and files,
so any 1-2-3 users must learn a new spreadsheet from scratch to take advantage
of Excel.;    Quattro Pro, on the other hand, needs only 512K of RAM and a
standard PC to run (though today a "standard PC" has a hard disk, which
Quattro needs). On that PC, you'll get a spreadsheet with all the commands and
functions you could want -- this is not a cut-rate beginner's spreadsheet;
it's a full and professional package. Taking a leaf from the most
sophisticated version of 1-2-3, Quattro Pro 2.0 even has a "solve for" command
that can work backward to find the values that lead to a given result. It does
not have the 3-D spreadsheets of the best Lotus or SuperCalc, but it offers
plenty of spreadsheet-linking to compensate.;    Those commands can be pushed
around by the keyboard or by a mouse, and you can use Quattro's menus of
commands or rearrange the menus to any setup you like. Quattro can
automatically rearrange its commands and menus to act just like Lotus 1-2-3, a
wonderful stroke for anyone used to those back slash commands of Lotus.
Quattro also reads and writes Lotus and dBASE files and can use Lotus macros
(stored commands for automating complex calculations). I find Quattro's
interface much easier to use than that of 1-2-3, though it now has so many
features that I was occasionally overwhelmed. (Quattro Pro runs on networks
and can share menus and fonts across networks to save from having them eat up
disk space on each PC.) If you're interested in data-base management or in
reaching information that's on networks, minicomputers and mainframes, Quattro
Pro 2.0 can link tightly to Borland's Paradox 3.5 data-base manager. That lets
you use Quattro as an interface to paradox or through Borland's SQL Link
program as the data analysis tool for information taken off larger computers.;
   And the graphics that were such a popular part of Quattro Pro 1.0 are given
yet more spirit in 2.0. There are 3-D chart types, a built-in drawing program,
clip art and "hypershow" buttons that let you turn on-the-screen slide shows
of Quattro charts into interactive presentations. I found the drawing program
tricky to use and a bit weak but certainly handy for basic drawing of lines
and shadows directly on spreadsheets. The slide shows worked nicely too,
especially with the clip art and macros, though some of these powers only come
as part of an optional Proshow Power Pack that will cost upgrading Quattro
users $39.95.;    My one gripe is that Borland's technical support isn't
keeping pace with the company's technology or market success. My Quattro came
with 3 1/2- and 5 1/4-inch disks. I don't use 5 1/4 anymore, so I tossed
them.;    When I sat down to install Quattro a couple of days later, I was
able to run through the entire process until the final step, when the screen
said "what is your serial number from Disk 1." There was no serial number on
Disk 1. I couldn't call tech support for help because it was the weekend. When
I turned to the problem again during the week, I was stuck on hold for 15
minutes before I got to ask about the serial number. I then was told that the
number was only on the 5 1/4-inch disk and was treated like either a software
pirate or a moron for not having the 5 1/4-inch disk still handy. Tech support
for such an important program ought to be open on weekends too; the serial
number ought to be on both disks; and the call might even be to an 800 number:
I paid to wait on hold and get treated like a dummy.;    Some programs change
a lot from version 1.0 to version 2.0. Quattro Pro hasn't, but it has added
some important new features, and the upgrade price of $99.95 from any
competing spreadsheet is a great incentive.; Quattro Pro 2.0, for PC, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard disk and DOS 2.0 or higher. Charts
require video graphics adapter. $495. Upgrade from Quattro Pro free if you
purchased since July 18; $79.95 if you bought before that; $99.95 upgrade from
competing spreadsheets. From Borland International, 1800 Green Hills Road, PO
Box 660001, Scotts Valley, CA 95066-0001. (408) 438-8400.; Summary: Quattro
Pro 2.0 adds tight integration to the Paradox 3.5 data-base manager, 3-D chart
types, a drawing feature, a solve-for command and interactive slide show
"hypertext" buttons to the already popular commands, menus and options of
Quattro Pro. Although the technical support isn't as good as it should be,
Quattro Pro 2.0 is easier to use and more graphic than Lotus 1-2-3 and runs on
smaller PCs and is more Lotus-compatible than Excel (even operating with Lotus
1-2-3 commands). The upgrade price of $99.95 from any competing spreadsheet is
a great deal.; On a scale of one to four, with one indicating poor and four
indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:; Performance: 4 computers;
   Ease of use: 3 computers;    Value: 4 computers  </TEXT>
