   Adobe Systems Inc. will showcase a new software technology
today that should increase electronic publishing's appeal.
   The technology, which Adobe said will not be commercially
available for at least five months, is an apparent boon for
newspaper publishers, printing concerns and others that
routinely create documents or transfer them electronically.
It will enable, for instance, newspapers to improve the look
of their classified pages, magazines to enhance their
listings and big organizations to ship electronic documents
more easily over computer networks. The company will announce
the much anticipated software at a trade show in Boston.

   "This is a fairy tale come true," said Allan Haley,
executive vice president at International Typeface Corp.,
which is a supplier of typeface.
   Mr. Haley said Adobe's software solves one of the most
nettlesome problems posed by modern computerized printing and
publishing equipment -- how to make very small or very large
type sizes appear crisper. Since printers stopped
individually cutting type in the early part of the century,
publishers haven't had the ability to add weight or
proportion to any given type size. Instead, publishers, who
switched over to computerized typesetting some years ago,
have been forced to accept a "one size fits all" approach to
type.
   "That doesn't work very well from a readability
standpoint," said Mr. Haley, who noted that in the days of
cut type the readability of smaller sizes could be ensured by
merely cutting them a little thicker than normal.
   Adobe's software, which the company is calling "Multiple
Master," also will help others that rely heavily on
computerized type and graphics. "It improves the legibility
of type on broadcast video, too," said Joseph Priestboy, a
New York computer consultant whose clients include cable
channel HBO. Mr. Priestboy said HBO plans to use the new
software for both printing and on-the-air video.
   Despite the warm reception from typography experts, the
new software won't have an immediate effect on Adobe's bottom
line, according to the company, based in Mountain View,
Calif. In the future, Adobe said it plans to both license its
software to others and sell packaged versions of typefaces
created with the technique.
   But it should boost confidence in Adobe's capacity to keep
one step ahead of its rivals, a major point of contention
among investors. Adobe is one of the more-valuable high-tech
issues -- in terms of market capitalization -- because it
basically controls software critical to electronic
publishing. Many laser printers, a key piece in computer
publishing, come equipped with Adobe's software, which earned
it more than $100 million in royalties in its fiscal year
ended Nov. 30.
   Adobe's stock, however, has been volatile in the past two
years since Apple Computer Inc., Adobe's biggest customer,
and Microsoft Corp., a big software supplier, decided to
produce a set of products that compete with Adobe's
offerings. On fears that Adobe's product may ultimately
become a commodity, Adobe's stock has been heavily shorted
recently.
   But the Apple-Microsoft alliance has yet to ship any of
its competing products, and last year International Business
Machines Corp., the world's biggest computer maker, backed
Adobe's approach for most of its computers. As evidence of
its continuing appeal, Adobe said yesterday that
Hewlett-Packard Co., a major supplier of computer printers
that has long resisted using Adobe's software, decided to
bundle the software with a new printer.
   "Adobe shows no sign of relaxing its monopoly {over a key
part} of the computer business," said Bruce Lupatkin, an
analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Adobe
shares closed at $46.50, down 25 cents.
   Separately, Adobe and Electronics for Imaging Inc. said
they formally agreed to settle their patent dispute. Under
terms of the pact, Adobe will receive a nonexclusive license
to a color-imaging technology for which EFI had been the
exclusive licensee. EFI, for its part, will become a licensee
of PostScript software from Adobe. In addition, Adobe made an
investment of an undisclosed amount in EFI and will become a
shareholder in the maker of color computing products.
