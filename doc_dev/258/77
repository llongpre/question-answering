   NAPA, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. gave a boost to two
software companies, endorsing approaches on document transfer
and network security.
   Apple said it is negotiating with Adobe Systems Inc., Palo
Alto, Calif., about incorporating Adobe's forthcoming
Carousel technology into the company's Macintosh system
software. "Look for us to support Carousel, although we
haven't decided whether to incorporate it into the system,"
said Roger Heinen, Apple's general manager for Macintosh
Software Architecture. Apple is Adobe's largest customer.

   Mr. Heinen's comments are a boost for Adobe's plans to
create a standard way of transferring documents from one type
of computer or application to another. Currently, such
transfers are bedeviled by a "tower of Babel" approach to
computer design that makes it virtually impossible to
maintain the same look and design of a document as it moves
from one incompatible computer to another.
   Separately, Apple disclosed that in 1990 it licensed
cryptographic and security software from RSA Data Security
Inc., a closely held concern in Redwood City, Calif. The
software both encrypts data transmitted over networks and
enables a sender to authenticate a document with a distinct
"digital signature."
   Apple said it is building RSA Data's code into its Open
Collaboration Environment, a forthcoming extension of its
Macintosh system software. The first part of the extension
will be released late this year, Apple said.
   In connection with its support for data encryption, Apple
said it had applied to the U.S. Commerce Department for the
right to export software containing the technology, which is
generally restricted as a sensitive technology. Apple said it
expects to receive export approval because the National
Security Agency, a leading agency on cryptographic policy,
has reviewed the design and raised no objections to it.
   Apple's announcements came at a conference on its plans
for its basic Macintosh software, where executives of the
Cupertino, Calif., company tried to dispel doubts that its
partnership with International Business Machines Co. means
its commitment to its Macintosh computer family is weakening.
"The Macintosh architecture is expandable way into the year
2000," said Michael Spindler, Apple's chief operating
officer. "For us, the Mac is the core of our structure."
   The Apple-IBM partnership last month launched Taligent,
whose goal is to create a new basic operating system for
personal computers, codenamed Pink. Taligent is producing
software for an IBM microprocessor called Power PC.
   Macintosh software currently only runs on chips from
Motorola Inc. Apple executives said that software written for
the Macintosh will work on future systems using the IBM chip.
   Apple also stressed that the Macintosh software would not
compete against Taligent software for customer loyalties.
Taligent "is not a replacement strategy for the Mac," said
Mr. Heinen. "This isn't like two spouses. It's like two
children. You can love them both."
