COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: MAC IICX -- THE CORE OF THE FUTURE

When the Apple Macintosh personal computer was introduced in 1984, it was 
regarded as something of a toy computer. It attracted its share of enthusiasts 
who loved its graphics and ease of use, but for the most part, business buyers 
weren't impressed and early sales were sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Apple has upgraded the machine regularly and has sold more than 
2 million Macs. Along the way, the company has upgraded the computer 
considerably and won a much wider array of customers, including many 
universities, engineering firms and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Apple unveiled its eighth member of the Macintosh family, the 
Macintosh IIcx. Although it isn't a breakthrough product, the machine is small, 
quiet and less expensive than similarly equipped earlier models. 
</P>
<P>
The new Macintosh is controlled by the Motorola 68030 central processing unit, 
the same one used in two other recently introduced Macs, the IIx and the SE/30. 
This high-performance chip lets the new Macs run about 15% faster than the 
original Mac II. More important, the new CPU has "memory management" circuitry 
that will enhance the computer's ability to run several programs at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Like the IIx and SE/30, the new Mac comes with a floppy disk drive that can 
read and write 3 1/2-inch disks formatted for the IBM compatible MS-DOS 
operating system. That makes it possible for the Mac to exchange data with IBM 
Personal System/2 machines, most laptops and many other IBM compatibles. Unless 
specially equipped, the new Macs cannot run IBM software, but they can access 
the same spreadsheets, word processing documents and other data files. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of the Mac II, the new machine has expansion slots so that 
users can easily add additional equipment such as monitors, internal modems or 
cards that accelerate processing speed. To save space and reduce costs, Apple 
has equipped the new machine with three, instead of six, expansion slots. That 
limits the ability to add accessories to the machine, but for the near future 
at least, three slots should be more than adequate for most users. 
</P>
<P>
The required monitor adapter card takes up one slot, but there currently are 
few uses for additional expansion cards. You can load up to eight megabytes of 
internal memory without using additional slots. And, as with all Macs, there 
are several built-in "ports," or sockets, that allow you to plug in equipment 
such as a modem, printer, extra hard disk drive or compact disc drive without 
using slots or even removing the cover. 
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, though, Apple Chief Executive John Sculley predicted that 
the physical design of the IIcx is likely to become a mainstay for the 
Macintosh line, suggesting that the same design would be used for future 
machines. If that is true, we can expect a plethora of add-in boards from 
hardware developers for upgrading the new Macs. That someday could make the 
machine's limited number of slots a frustration to computer users. 
</P>
<P>
The new machine is about a foot wide, 14 inches deep and six inches tall. For 
me, its compact design makes it much more attractive than the larger Mac II or 
IIx. Office space is a precious commodity, and I hate to see it wasted by 
unnecessarily large computers. 
</P>
<P>
The IIcx can be placed vertically or horizontally and can be put on the floor, 
on the desk or even inside a cabinet or drawer. It weighs only 14 pounds and is 
small enough to stuff into an over-the-shoulder bag. Of course, you need a 
monitor, a keyboard and a mouse, so I'd hardly call it transportable. However, 
you could buy an extra monitor and easily carry the machine itself between home 
and work. 
</P>
<P>
I'm hoping that some enterprising company develops a lightweight, flat panel 
display that can be mounted on the unit, turning it into a transportable 
machine. Apple is reportedly planning to release a laptop Mac later this year, 
but it is expected to be very expensive, according to industry insiders. 
</P>
<P>
The new machine is much quieter than earlier models. If you're in a busy 
office, you might not notice the noise from your computer's fan or hard disk. 
But I work in a quiet environment and I hate being forced to listen to noisy 
computers. The Mac II and Mac IIx are too loud for my taste. If you're shopping 
for a new computer, you might want to listen to it in a quiet environment, not 
a noisy showroom, before making your decision. 
</P>
<P>
Like IBM's latest models, the new Mac can be taken apart easily. You loosen one 
screw to remove the cover and, from there, you can remove every component 
without using any tools. Its modular design makes it easy for a technician, or 
even an average computer user, to replace components. 
</P>
<P>
Macintosh computers never are cheap, although they are about the same as 
similarly equipped systems from IBM. But because Apple has patents and 
copyrights that prevent others from copying the Mac, you're not going to see 
cheap "clones," as you do with IBM equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Macintosh IIcx, with a megabyte of memory and a floppy disk drive, has a 
suggested retail price of $4,669. With a 40-megabyte internal hard disk and an 
Apple monochrome display, you'll pay almost $6,000. And if you want to run more 
than one program at a time, you'll need additional memory. Apple charges $2,000 
for a four-megabyte expansion kit. At the suggested retail price, it would cost 
almost $9,000 for a fully loaded Mac IIcx with four megabytes of internal 
memory, an 80-megabyte hard disk and an Apple color monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Apple does have competition when it comes to memory, disk drives, 
monitors, printers, keyboards and other peripheral equipment. Just as with IBM 
equipment, you can save a lot of money by buying a stripped-down machine and 
shopping around for your other equipment. You might ask if your dealer can put 
together such a hybrid system. Apple won't guarantee other companies' 
equipment, though, so be sure that the store is willing to stand behind such a 
system.

can be used to add monitors, accelerator cards, internal modems and other 
devices. Two serial ports. A Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) connector 
for external disk drives, compact disc drives and other equipment. Includes a 
plug for an external floppy disk drive. Compatible with virtually all expansion 
boards for Macintosh II.
