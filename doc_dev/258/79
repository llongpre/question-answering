<LEADPARA>  FOR YEARS, Tony Bove has been collecting bootleg music videos and songs by the
Beatles and other groups. Now, by using a program based on a new Apple
Computer Inc. software standard called Quicktime, which allows video and sound
to be incorporated into Macintosh computers, he is developing his own
presentations to show friends on his Mac.;   These creations are like music
videos, but they are also "interactive," allowing the computer user to cut
among songs, movie scenes, animated graphics and excerpts from documentaries
in response to whatever is on the screen at any moment.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Easily prepared multimedia presentations like Bove's have long been a
sacred goal for the personal computer industry, which is counting on this
technology to reignite its once-explosive growth.;   Quicktime will be a
standard component in color Macintosh computers beginning early next year.
Announced in June by Apple, it is a software extension to the Macintosh
operating system that will appear in a range of new programs that add
full-motion video, sound and computer animation to existing computer
applications.;   This capacity results from technological breakthroughs that
have allowed video images to be digitally encoded, just as audio data is
captured on compact discs, and then to be stored and manipulated
electronically using techniques that "compress" the digital data.;   For
example, by adding a standard "movie" file format for digitized video,
Quicktime will permit users to place movie animations in word-processing or
data-base documents, accomplish simple video teleconferencing over standard
dial-up phone lines and edit video images to play back later.;   "It's a
grass-roots tool," said Bove, who edits a computer newsletter from his home in
Gualala. "There has never been a technology that has been scaled down like
this to the level of the individual.";   At the Comdex computer exhibition, a
number of consumer product companies, including Sony and Eastman Kodak,
demonstrated new equipment designed to bridge the gap between videocassette
cameras and recorders and personal computers.;   Apple is hoping Quicktime
will lead to a burst of applications in this new video market, just as two of
the Macintosh's original features -- the graphics-oriented screen display and
the laser printer -- led to a trove of new programs.;   According to Doug
Camplejohn, the Cupertino company's product manager for Quicktime, Apple's
advantage over other multimedia configurations is that there are several
million Macintoshes that can now run Quicktime applications off the shelf. To
run multimedia applications in the IBM PC-compatible world, it is necessary
either to purchase a specialized multimedia personal computer or to obtain an
upgrade kit to run applications stored on CD-ROM.;   "It's not clear yet who
will win," said Rob Lippincott, director of product development for Lotus
Development Corp.'s multimedia products group. "But Apple appears to have the
better design. It's a complete system rather than a set of extensions.";  
Quicktime consists of a series of components: a movie "toolbox" that provides
users with ready-made software functions for creating, editing and playing
back digitized movies on a computer screen; an image-compression manager to
create a standard way of connecting movies and other kinds of data; and a
"component manager" that offers a standard way of connecting peripheral
devices like digitizer cards and cameras.;   Quicktime offers graphics
capability for any Macintosh computer that uses at least a 68020 powerful
processor. Because of its modular design, it permits the addition of a variety
of hardware-based image-compression technologies, including industry standards
developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and the Motion Picture
Experts Group.;   The most widespread use of Quicktime is likely to be in
products that will permit editing of video and sound information as simply as
text and other data are edited on personal computers.;   For example, Adobe
Systems Inc. is preparing to introduce Premier, a digital video system
originally developed by Supermac Technology Inc. It includes a video capture,
playback and compression system as well as a digital video editor designed to
work with Quicktime.;   Systems like Adobe's will dramatically change the way
video is used. Manipulating images in motion will become standard personal
computer operations.  </TEXT>
