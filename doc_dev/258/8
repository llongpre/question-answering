<LEADPARA>  Writers and musicians were quick to recognize the advantages of computer
technology, but artists have been relatively slow to give up their palettes
and easels in return for the millions of colors and magic canvases computers
offer.;    It isn't that artists are slow; it's just that drawing with a
computer mouse is like trying to draw with a potato. It lacks elegance.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Throw out the mouse. A remarkable tool called the Wacom SD-510C
pressure-sensitive digitizer (list price $695), which comprises a cordless,
pen-like stylus and a 6-inch by 9-inch tablet, comes close to being a magic
paintbrush.;    Nothing can replace the immediacy and tactile responsiveness
of a paintbrush or pencil in an artist's hand, but the Wacom stylus seems to
be the next best thing.;    We tested the Wacom tablet and cordless stylus
with a new Macintosh paint program called Oasis (list price $795), which gives
the artist all the tools necessary to create on screen the varied effects of
watercolor, charcoal, pastel, gouache, pencil, ink, oil, crayon or almost any
other medium.;    Instead of painting on canvas or paper, the artist "paints"
invisibly on the tablet and sees the results displayed on the computer
screen.;    Wacom Inc. of Paramus, N.J., and Time Arts Inc. of Santa Rosa, the
maker of Oasis, are bundling their products for a combined price of $1,195, a
savings of $295. For more information, contact Time Arts at (707) 576-7722.;  
 Using the Wacom SD-510C and Oasis in tandem, someone with artistic talent
conceivably would be able to mimic virtually any artistic style or even invent
new styles unique to the computer age.;    Included in the Oasis software
tools are controls that transform the Wacom stylus into a versatile painting
or drawing implement, from pencil to broadbrush to airbrush.;    The artist
can select colors from a color Macintosh's entire palette, which on my model
comprises about 16 million hues. That's some paintbox.;    Further, Oasis
permits the artist to choose special attributes not seen in previous computer
paint programs. Using the pressure-sensitive Wacom stylus, the artist can vary
the density of any stroke; that is, pressing harder makes a progressively
darker image, just as it would on paper.;    Also, a line might start wide and
taper off as the pressure decreases, again as it would in a conventional brush
stroke.;    The artist can even control the color density, "wetness" and
dry-out speed of any stroke, plus many other subtle controls that are made
possible by the pressure-sensitive tablet.;    We especially like the Oasis
"lightbox" feature that permits the artist to overlay one "page" over another
and make the top one transparent. One can then use the stylus to trace an
image into a new file.;    Besides Oasis, most of the major paint programs for
the Macintosh now support pressure-sensitive input, including Digital Darkroom
and Superpaint 2.0 from Silicon Beach Software, Photoshop from Adobe Systems
Inc., Colorstudio from Letraset Inc., Studio/32 from Electronic Arts Inc.,
Pixelpaint Pro from Supermac Technology and Ultrapaint from Deneba Systems
Inc.;    So far, there is only one major pressure-sensitive paint program for
International Business Machine Corp. Personal Computers and compatibles:
Lumena, a $2,495 program from Time Arts, the maker of Oasis.  </TEXT>
