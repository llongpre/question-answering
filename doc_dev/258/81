   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Adobe Systems Inc. said it agreed
to allow Lotus Development Corp. to use Adobe's typeface
software in all Lotus software. The deal solidifies Adobe's
dominance in the market for "font" software that controls how
typefaces are created by printers and displayed on computer
screens.
   Under the agreement, Adobe will allow Lotus, Cambridge,
Mass., to use Adobe's Type Manager software in all of Lotus's
software. Lotus will first use the software, which, among
other things, smooths out the jagged lines in on-screen
characters, on a version of Lotus's popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet
program written to run on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software,
Adobe said.
