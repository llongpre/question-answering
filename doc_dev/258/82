   Apple Computer Inc., which has taken a
battering on Wall Street as it contends with a computer industry
slowdown, is betting its bottom line on three new, lower-priced
Macintoshes it will introduce Monday.
   Analysts are divided over whether Apple's effort to gain market
share at the expense of profit margins will revitalize the company
or cut into earnings.
   Investors, so far, appear to be wary - Apple's stock price has
plummeted from a high of $50 a share during the past year to a low
of $25.50 last week before closing Friday at $28.25.
   ``Apple's overall unit shipments have declined and you can make
a very strong case that the markets Apple is trying to enter now
are much more closed than they used to be,'' said Douglas Kass, an
analyst at Dataquest Inc., a San Jose-based research firm. ``They
missed the window of opportunity in the lower end a year and a half
ago.''
   Kass said the new machines will produce a ``pretty rapid spike
in sales'' and will strengthen Apple's mid-range offerings. But, he
added, ``I don't think the low end will generate that much to make
it a big deal.''
   Others are more optimistic.
   ``People forget what happens when you introduce a very
inexpensive version of a product that a lot of people want,'' said
Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter in
San Francisco. ``Apple's volume is going to go through the roof. I
may be out in left field in this, but I think this totally reverses
their fortunes.''
   Apple, stagnating with a 9 percent share of the $67 billion
personal computer market - down from a peak of 14 percent in 1987 -
is launching its new machines with a $40 million television and
print advertising campaign.
   The company is cranking up production of the computers to the
limit, anticipating strong demand as it introduces the machines
simultaneously in 121 countries.
   Most of the company's dealers already have been given previews
of the computers and, despite a reluctance by Apple executives to
provide details before Monday, there aren't many secrets.
   The Mac Classic, a compact desktop computer based on the
Motorola 68000 microprocessor with a built-in black-and-white
monitor, will be priced at about $1,000 with a floppy-disk drive
and $1,500 with a 40-megabyte hard disk drive.
   The list prices are less than half those of the comparable and
very popular Macintosh Plus and SE models, and street prices are
expected to be several hundred dollars lower.
   The Macintosh LC, based on the more powerful Motorola 68020
microprocessor and listed at $2,400 with a 40-megabyte hard disk,
and the Macintosh SI, based on the still more powerful Motorola
68030 and priced $3,800 to $4,500 with an 80-megabyte hard disk,
are several thousand dollars cheaper than existing models. Both
will have separately available 12-inch monitors - black-and-white
for $300 or color for $600.
   Most analysts predict the LC, Apple's first low-cost color
model, eventually will be the hottest seller of the new machines.
But it won't be ready in volume until January, costing Apple the
key Christmas sales season.
   The computers won't be as cheap as the least expensive clones of
International Business Machines Corp. personal computers. But the
new Macs will be competitive with IBM clones equipped to use
Windows 3.0, the software from Microsoft Corp. that gives
IBM-compatible machines the ``look and feel'' of Macintoshes.
   Apple chairman and chief executive officer, John Sculley,
acknowledges the risks in introducing new products with lower
profit margins, but he said he thinks the timing is right with a
recession looming and industry sales bumping along sluggishly.
   Until the introduction of Windows 3.0 in May, Apple's
Macintoshes, because of their unique, easy-to-use design, allowed
the company to keep prices high and attain more than 50 percent
gross profit margins.
   ``The strategy Apple has been pursuing in the late 1980s is one
which made us the third most profitable computer company in the
world,'' Sculley said at a recent briefing with reporters. ``It was
a pretty good one when we had high industry growth, when there
wasn't anyone who had technology that looked anything like ours,
and when we were trying to reposition Apple from a toy company to a
serious computer company.
   ``It's quite clear that with the industry slowing down, with
more competition out there, that Apple, if it is going to be a
significant player in the 1990s, has to go for market share and get
very aggressive,'' he said.
   Sculley said he believes investors will support the strategy
``as long as the products are well received by the market ... and
the efforts lead to higher market share.''
   With the Christmas buying season beginning, it shouldn't take
long for investors to find out if Apple's plan is correct. The big
question facing Apple and every desktop computer maker, though, is
whether the weak economy will scuttle sales for everyone.
