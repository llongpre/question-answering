   NCR Corp., a company known for electronic cash
registers and automated teller machines, has launched a software
system that marks a sharp departure from its traditional sales
strongholds, analysts said.
   The ``Cooperation'' software, unveiled Tuesday at a glitzy press
conference in Manhattan's theater district, employs visual
on-screen aids and other features to let users obtain information
from data bases, route documents and talk electronically with other
employees.
   The announcement comes three weeks after the company said it
would replace its entire computer line with industry-standard
machines that all could communicate with each other. Based on the
open system, the new software launch is designed to help a
company's computer users communicate with each other - even if they
are working on non-NCR computers.
   ``Nobody can call NCR dull anymore,'' said NCR Chairman and CEO
Charles E. Exley Jr. at the press conference, as he slipped on a
pair of bright red sunglasses outfitted with flashing lights.
   The fifth largest U.S. computer maker, based in Dayton, Ohio,
dominates the slow-growing banking and retail-automation markets
but is considered a runner-up in mainstream business computers. The
new software targets all types of companies from 50 employees and
up.
   ``What you're seeing is NCR coming out of their shell with this
product,'' said Bob Vautrain, senior research analyst at Gartner
Group Inc. ``They're trying to take an obscure $6 billion company
from the Midwest and take it into general-purpose computing.''
   Relying on Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave visual computer
technology, Cooperation is the first software product released
under NCR's new ``open'' computing architecture.
   The product, unveiled at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, was backed
by an extravagant stage show of colorful lights, screens aglow with
changing images of the product in use, and a demonstration by two
computer operators using the software product at actual on-stage
work stations.
   The extravaganza was intended to build excitement among software
manufacturers and encourage them to write programs that can run on
the NCR system, analysts said.
   ``Now that you have this great interface, you have to get
software manufacturers to write for it,'' said Vautrain. ``I think
there's a possibility it will happen.''
   Exley said that Cooperation is far more comprehensive than
equivalent systems on the market, with the ability to integrate
thousands of standard software packages.
   ``There is nothing announced at this point - much less in the
form of product - anywhere as near as comprehensive,'' Exley said
in an interview following the announcement.
   The software modules range from $1,700-$2,500 per user for a
24-user company, but the total cost of operating the system when
the workstations are included comes to $10,000-$12,000 per user,
Exley said, noting that the cost for a 100-station company would
total $1 million.
   The first release of Cooperation is scheduled for next month.
The product is expected to be more generally available in March.
   NCR is backing the launch of its open system products with a $12
million advertising campaign, starting with an ad in Wednesday's
Wall Street Journal, NCR officials said. Other ads will appear in
industry trade publications.
   Next week NCR is expected to elaborate how companies can employ
NCR's new software.
