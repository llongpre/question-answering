   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. said it agreed to
incorporate software from Adobe Systems Inc. into the basic
computer program that comes with all of Apple's Macintosh
models.
   The accord is a coup for Adobe, which is the dominant
supplier of printer and type software for personal computers.
It also is a fresh example of Apple's new willingness to rely
on outsiders for help with its products.

   In the past, Apple zealously adhered to an "only invented
here" philosophy that sometimes limited the company. Over the
past 12 months, however, the computer maker has tried to
shore up weak spots in its business by seeking aid from
others. Last month, Apple made a tentative agreement to
develop software with International Business Machines Corp.
In October, Apple is expected to sell for the first time a
computer it didn't manufacture itself -- a portable computer
made by Sony Corp., a longtime Apple supplier.
   The latest agreement, which is formally a letter of
intent, shows that Apple has come full circle in its
relationship with Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif.
Adobe's software, which controls the way typefaces are
created by printers and displayed on computer screens, was
instrumental in the computerization of publishing, and the
company previously had support from Apple, which was the
first big personal-computer company to incorporate Adobe's
code in its computer printers.
   In 1989, Apple sold its 16.4% stake in Adobe and said it
would compete against the company by developing its own
version of Adobe's product with Microsoft Corp., the biggest
maker of personal computer software. That action was seen as
a major blow to Adobe because Apple then was Adobe's largest
shareholder and customer, accounting for 28% of the company's
revenue in 1988.
   But by this year, Apple had signed a fresh licensing pact
with Adobe, and Adobe scored a partial victory last year when
it signed a technology licensing pact with Apple. More
recently, Microsoft pulled the plug on some of its efforts to
compete with Adobe.
   Under the agreement, Apple said it will incorporate
Adobe's Type 1 font software into future versions of its
Macintosh system software. The agreement also calls for
development of software necessary to support the Adobe code
and for Apple to deliver the capability to handle Type 1
fonts before release of the system software.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Apple's shares were
quoted at $51, up 50 cents, and Adobe's were at $48.75, down
$1.50.
