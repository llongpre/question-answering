year for colour systems - Desktop Publishing

THE MOMENTUM of desktop publishing (DTP) is being strongly maintained as
prices fall for high-performance personal computers, laser printers and
enhanced page-composition software.
Furthermore, new methods of colour creation for documents of all types are
exciting users right across the DTP spectrum.
As businesses large and small discover the almost endless range applications
for DTP - from brochures, sales catalogues and financial reports to colour
magazines, books and newspapers - there is a rising demand for
better-looking publications.
Countless publications in typewritten form are also becoming candidates for
DTP - 'for business, DTP has meant lower costs, more control and later
deadlines on a wide variety of printed materials,' says Emilia Knight,
Apple's publishing marketing manager.
Worldwide revenues for DTP software tools are likely to reach Dollars 369m
this year, rising by Dollars 100m in 1994 and reaching Dollars 663m by 1996,
according to forecasts by the International Data Corporation.
Much of the thrust of the DTP market has come from the US. Although Apple
Corporation, with its Macintosh computers, along with the Adobe Postscript
page description language, were founder companies of the industry, an
increasing number of other hardware and software companies are developing
their own market strategies for DTP.
Today, there are two main DTP markets. One, at the lower-end - what is
termed the personal or 'office DTP' sector, including in-house publishing to
promote its services or products. Then there is the high-end, professional
DTP market, described by Apple as 'DTP for profit.' This includes graphic
art services, newspaper, book and magazine production.
On the hardware front, the increasing power of PCs and portable computers is
good news for desktop publishers, especially with the move towards colour
systems which demand. At a starting point, the cost of a basic Apple DTP
system is under Pounds 2,500 with, say, an Apple Mac LCII computer, with 14
ins. colour monitor, (Pounds 1,099); Aldus Pagemaker software (Pounds 500);
and a personal LaserWriter for around Pounds 775. Five years ago, the cost
of a basic system might have been nearer Pounds 8,000.
Apple's new mid-range Mac II and Centris computers (prices range from Pounds
1,675 to Pounds 2,595) have systems built-in to support up to 256 colours in
the new 14 ins colour display - and can be easily upgraded to deliver 32,000
colours. Last month, Apple introduced its Colour Printer (Pounds 1,995) for
Mac-users wanting to use colour in everyday documents. It takes advantage of
ColorSync software's colour matching capabilities, ensuring that DTP users
achieve colour output that closely matches colours created on the computer's
display.
DTP technology has brought creators (writers, designers, editors,
illustrators and photographers) much closer to the production process, and
in many cases eliminated the need for a separate production step altogether,
says Jonathan Seybold, the DTP industry's guru.
The collision, eight years ago, between the computing and publishing began a
'revolution that turned the publishing industry upside down ..and spawned
desktop publishing,' according to Jonathon Seybold. The publishing
revolution is far from over, which means that training for new DTP entrants
continues to be an important issue, especially with the need for skills to
operate for colour images systems and other of new technologies.
While today's software with colourful icons and graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) help to reduce the DTP learning curve, training and consultancy
services are in demand from business users. Rank Xerox, with its philosophy
of 'total quality document,' offers a range of workshops for programs such
as PageMaker, Ventura and CorelDraw.
The reason that colour is the hot topic of the DTP world is that, until now,
the missing ingredient has been colour management systems.
While different devices, such as scanners, monitors and printers deliver
colour variations, software products - such as ColorSync from Apple - now
provide excellent matching facilities.
In the colour management arena, companies such as Kodak, Agfa, EFI
(Electronics For Imaging), Quark, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe and other
suppliers are planning strategies to make colour management the norm. There
is also wide interest in Kodak's new Photo CD system - a quick and
economical way to bring colour images to the desktop for business and
commercial imaging applications.
Photo CD allows DTP users to take 35mm colour pictures, scan them on to a
disk and retrieve them via a CD-ROM drive. High resolution pictures can then
be easily imported into documents. Linked with Photo CD is Kodak's new
PhotoEdge software which allows images on a PC to be modified in colour,
tone and shape.
Next to colour, the hottest area in computer publishing are the emerging
digital technologies able to deliver documents in a new form. For example,
users may wish to view only selected portions of documents, all stored
electronically.
In the fast-changing DTP world, specialist software, such as PageMaker and
Quark XPress have evolved beyond all recognition. For professional
page-layout systems in the UK, 53 per cent use Quark XPress and 23 per cent
use PageMaker, according to Ashdown, the strategic marketing consultancy.
Aldus has recently announced PageMaker 5.0 for Windows and Macintosh,
offering 100 new features and enhancements for professional DTP users.
In the Windows environment, Microsoft, in particular, is making ease-of-use
a strong feature. It has seen wide success among DTP entrants with the
'Microsoft Publisher' package.
Windows applications overtook sales of DOS applications in the UK in
November for the first time, according to Romtec, which forecasts a 25 per
cent share lead for Windows this year.
As technologies merge, there is growing interest in multimedia - the
computer-based medium which brings together text, high-resolution graphics,
The conversion of traditional media into a common digital format gives
multimedia its wide appeal. Apple, the leading supplier in this field, has
been providing hardware platforms for multimedia since 1985.
Microsoft, the developer of MS/DOS operating system and the Windows 3
graphical environment, has been involved in developing multimedia technology
on PCs since the mid-1980s. The conversion of traditional media into a
common digital format is what gives multimedia its wide appeal.
Meanwhile, interest is also being shown in publishing without paper - such
as electronic delivery, allowing rapid access to visually sophisticated
documents. Adobe's Acrobat software, for example, aims to solve the
transmission of these documents between incompatible computers.
