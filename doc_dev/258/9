<TEXT>     TouchBASE is a "contacts data base" -- a computerized address book -- that
installs as a desk accessory on your Macintosh. TouchBASE lets you easily
enter, store, sort, search through and print reports, fax cover sheets, labels
and envelopes from the addresses in the data base. It is a bit too expensive
and can't print a chronological list of the calls you make but has lots of
options for fast and fancy searching. I recommend it, but only if you have a
hard disk. (Reviewed 2/10/91);    3 computers;  Type Manager 2.0, Type
Reunion, TypeAlign, for Macintosh Plus, SE, II or Portable with at least two
disk drives. Type Manager 2.0, $99; Type Reunion, $65; TypeAlign, $99.95. From
Adobe Systems, 1585 Charleston Road, P.O. Box 7900, Mountain View, CA
94039-7900. (415) 961-4400.;    TypeStyler 1.5, for Macintosh Plus, SE, SE30,
II or Portable with at least two disk drives. $199.95. From Broderbund
Software, 17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903-2101. (415) 492-3200.;    If you
just process words, you don't need to worry much about fonts. But for those
producing graphic designs, logos, newspapers, magazines and so on, Type
Manager 2.0 from Adobe is a must. It automatically improves the look of
characters on screen, especially large ones. A related Adobe utility, Type
Reunion, automatically organizes all the fonts listed in the Mac's font menu.
This can be a godsend, although the price is high. Adobe's TypeAlign is a desk
accessory for shaping and distorting text, which can work with millions of
colors and can force type to follow any path you draw. It's easy to use but
doesn't have many of the features of the competing TypeStyler from Broderbund,
which includes built-in libraries of effects, shapes and gradient fills, along
with clear commands for molding text into almost any form. (Reviewed 2/3/91); 
  Type Manager:; 4 computers; Type Reunion:; 3 computers; TypeAlign:; 3
computers;    TypeStyler:; 4 computers;  Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit 3.5,
for PC, PS/2 or compatible. $91.25. From S&amp;S Enterprises, Weylands Court,
Water Meadow, Germain Street, Chesham, Bucks HP5 1LP, United Kingdom. Phone
0494-791900.;    The Norton AntiVirus, for PC, PS/2 or compatible with at
least 384K of RAM and DOS 2.1. $129.95. From Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave.,
Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 253-9600.;    Virex-PC, for PC, PS/2 or compatible
with at least 512K of RAM and DOS 2.1. $129.95. From Microcom Inc., P.O. Box
51816, Durham, N.C. 27717. (919) 490-1277.;    Virucide, for PC, PS/2 or
compatible with at least 256K RAM and DOS 2.0. $49. From Parsons Technology,
375 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52402. (800) 779-6000.;    If you
download files from bulletin boards, share disks with friends or are connected
to a local area network, it makes sense to use an anti-virus utility. Dr.
Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit is a bunch of utilities that can detect or
analyze certain virus actions. It is difficult to use and is quite slow.
Virex-PC finds and prevents virus infections, but its many options are set up
in a confusing way. The Norton AntiVirus is the most thorough program for
virus eradication and prevention and is easily installed and used. Norton also
provides the best upgrade scheme to catch new viruses -- with an on-line
bulletin board. Virucide is the least expensive, is just as fast as Virex or
Norton, targets a longer list of known viruses but lacks a prevention feature.
