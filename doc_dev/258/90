<LEADPARA>  IN THE PAST few months I've been looking at "notebook" computers, the five- to
seven-pound IBM-compatible computers that are the fastest-growing part of the
personal computer market. It seems like everyone is making a notebook system
these days, from Compaq and IBM (rumored to be introducing one soon) to Epson,
AT&amp;T, Dell, AST, Sharp, Toshiba, TI and some unknown companies such as Librex
and Astarte. Even the no-name mail-order firms are offering notebooks.;   
Unfortunately, not many of these notebooks are actually shipping yet.
Fortunately, because so many have been announced, the prices are dropping
constantly even before most of the systems hit the market.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The real pleasure in today's typical notebook is that it is powerful enough
to be your "only" computer.;    Powerful now; Though it weighs less than
yesterday's 12- to 20-pound "lap-tops," today's notebook can have as much
processor power, disk memory and chip memory as today's typical desk-top. (The
only place it falls short is in screen display, though you can hook up a
standard display to most notebook computers.) However, you still pay more for
the speed and storage when it is miniaturized for a notebook than you would
for a desk-top equivalent. In other words, you can get more megabytes of
memory and disk and a faster processor for the same money if you agree to have
it in a big, clunky box that eats up a lot of your desk.;    Nearly all
notebook computers look alike. Everyone is using the "clamshell" design, where
a flat box (perhaps a foot wide by a foot deep and a bit more than an inch
tall) containing processor, memory, disk drives and battery is topped by a
keyboard. Above that is a liquid crystal display panel that folds up,
revealing the keyboard. On the sides are the power and screen control
switches, and on the back are the serial and parallel ports.;    Differences
appear in the feel of the keyboards, in the presence and position of special
keys (from function keys to numeric keypads), in the processor (either the
286, the 16MHz 386SX or the 20MHz 386SX) and in the hard disk's speed and
capacity (at least 20 megabytes, but in some machines as much as 30 or 40
megabytes). The displays also differ. Some support only CGA or EGA graphics,
while others support VGA and even show various shades of gray. Finally, there
are differences in the time it takes to use or charge the battery.;    The
Sharp PC-6220 (Sharp, (800) 237-4277, $3,999) has been a favorite with
computer experts for many months. (The same machine is also available from
Texas Instruments -- as the TravelMate 2000 -- and from CompuAdd -- as the
Companion. The CompuAdd version costs only $2,495.) Weighing only 4.3 pounds,
it still contains a full keyboard, full screen and hard disk. It doesn't have
a floppy disk drive. Instead, you're supposed to move files to other computers
with a cable and the LapLink software that's built in. Some analysts think
this is OK. I don't. I want a floppy for quick backups and for taking my
information to another system.;    The other flaw in the PC-6220 is that it
has only a 286 processor chip. That's not enough for the latest version of
1-2-3, Excel, PageMaker or Ventura Publisher. Nor can that chip handle memory
well enough to run the disk cache and other utility software that I want even
for simple computing tasks.;    The Everex Tempo LX (Everex, (800) 437-3837,
$2,999) is one of the first 386SX-based notebooks to be more than a news
announcement. It weighs seven pounds (with the battery pack -- which many
companies conveniently leave out of their weight specifications), though you
should assume another couple pounds because you'll need to carry the AC
adapter/charger, a few disks and perhaps a modem. The Tempo has a full-size
keyboard that feels great to this touch-typist and a full screen that folds up
from the keyboard (in the clamshell design) and is easy to read, but the
entire system is 10 inches wide, 12 inches deep and 2 inches tall.;    The
Tempo comes with 640 kilobytes of memory, though you should try to get it with
at least a megabyte more than that. The screen is compatible with the VGA
standard and shows 16 shades of gray, plus there's a port on the back you can
connect to a standard color monitor. There's a single high-density floppy disk
drive and a fast 20-megabyte hard disk. DOS 4.01 is built in, and the Tempo
will run any PC programs. I found it easy and comfortable to use.;    If
you're looking at portables, here's some advice without any "ifs" or "it
depends" qualifications: First, look for something that weighs five to seven
pounds -- a "notebook" computer.;    Second, don't buy a 286-based notebook
computer. Stick with one that uses the newer, faster 386SX processor chip. Not
only will your machine run much faster, it will be able to run all the latest
software.;    Third, only buy a 386SX notebook computer that has or can be
equipped immediately with at least 2 megabytes of random-access memory. Even
if 640K is enough to get you started, many programs -- including Windows and
the latest 1-2-3 -- demand 1 megabyte or more.;    Needs memory; Fourth, make
sure the notebook has at least a 20-megabyte hard disk and a 3 1/2-inch floppy
disk drive. You need the floppy for easy file transfer with desk-top computers
and to load new software. You need those megabytes of hard disk to hold
today's huge programs -- where fonts, environments (such as Windows) and
graphics can easily eat up 5 megabytes or more per program. Get a 30-megabyte
or 40-megabyte disk if you can.;    Fifth, don't worry about a color screen.
Few people really need color in a portable, and it jacks the price up
tremendously. Most notebooks have a port on the back that lets them display
their work on a standard color monitor anyway, so you can get color if you
need it by borrowing a PC monitor.;    Sixth, don't buy your 386SX notebook
computer from Compaq or IBM or anyone else who wants to charge you $5,000 to
$7,000 or more. So many companies have jumped into the notebook business in
the past six months that you can pick up a perfectly fine notebook with the
same powers for $3,000. Make sure the machine is actually available -- don't
put money down and wait for it.;    A final warning: These machines are slick,
cute and seductive. The $3,000 you spend for a 16MHz, 1-megabyte-RAM,
20-megabyte-disk notebook could buy you a 33MHz, 4-megabyte, 80-megabyte
desk-top system. Do you really need the portability?;    Sharp PC-6220.
$2,695. From Sharp Electronics Corp., Sharp Plaza, Mahwah, N.J. 07430. (800)
237-4277.;    Tempo LX. $2,999. From Everex Systems Inc., 48431 Milmont Drive,
Fremont, CA 94538. (800) 437-3837.; Summary: If you're looking for a portable,
look for a notebook computer that weighs 5 to 7 pounds, has a 386SX processor,
has at least a 20MB hard disk, has a floppy drive, contains both full-size
screen and keyboard, supports VGA graphics and costs $3,000 or less. The
Everex Tempo LX is a good example, fulfilling all of these requirements. The
Sharp PC 6220 is also a good machine but has only the 286 processor and so is
already falling into obsolescence. (And if you really want the light weight,
you can buy the same computer from CompuAdd for hundreds less.) Remember when
you're buying a portable, though, that a desk-top for the same price will have
much more power and storage. Also keep in mind that more companies are
advertising notebook PCs than are actually shipping them.; On a scale of one
to four, with one indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how
the product rates:; Sharp PC-6220:; Performance: 2 computers; Ease of use: 4
computers; Value: 2 computers; Tempo:; Performance: 3 computers; Ease of Use:
3 computers; Value: 3 computers  </TEXT>
