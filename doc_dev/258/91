<LEADPARA>  MOST PEOPLE will admit that the Macintosh is easier to use than any IBM
Personal Computer or PC compatible.;    The Mac's icons and pull-down menus
are easier to remember and use than DOS's typed commands. Even when Windows
adds an icon and menu interface to the PC, the Mac's quick and easy way with
added peripherals and changed configurations (such as installing and choosing
a printer) still put it out in front of the comfort race.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Macs have been seen as having less raw horsepower than the fastest PCs.
For that reason -- among many -- not everybody owns a Mac, despite the ease of
use.;    But are the fastest PCs really more potent than the fastest Macs?;   
Within that question are several smaller questions. Which PC do you compare
with which Mac? Do you compare machines of the same price? Do you run the same
programs on each or run the best programs available for each? And what sort of
computer power are you talking about, anyway?;    Computer power comes in
several forms: processor "integer" speed, processor "floating-point" speed,
memory size, disk speed, disk size and graphics quality and speed. A computer
that is great in one category won't necessarily be tops in another. And it may
not need to be.;    Server computers on networks need all the processing
integer speed and memory they can get to manage the work of many dependent
network computers. They also need large and fast disks to handle all the saved
and retrieved files. But they don't need graphics and rarely need
floating-point speed (for handling complex mathematical equations).;    Some
individual computers need maximum processor integer and floating-point speed
to crunch complex sets of numbers or tangled desk-top publishing pages of text
and graphics. But an individual computer probably doesn't need the disk
capacity that a server needs. If that individual computer is massaging a data
base, though, it may need the large disk but be able to live without the
floating-point power.;    The Macintosh IIfx (Apple Computer Inc., $8,669,
(408) 996-1010) is the fastest Mac Apple makes. It is built around a 40MHz
68030 chip, almost the latest chip in the 68000 processor family. I say
"almost" because there is a 50MHz 68030 chip that you can find on a few
Macintosh "accelerator" boards (you plug these into a slower Mac to speed it
up). There are even a few new products with the new 68040 chip, a processor
that is two times faster on integer processing and five times faster on
floating-point processing than the 68030. (By this fall Apple may have its own
68040 Macintosh.) You can buy the system with an 80-megabyte hard drive or a
160-megabyte drive -- I suggest the latter. The standard memory of 4 megabytes
is fine for anyone who runs one program at a time, but most people will be
more comfortable adding another 4 megabytes or so.;    The IIfx comes without
video card or monitor -- because some people want a fast Mac for number
crunching with minimum graphics while others want a Mac for large-screen
graphics with minimum number crunching. This is also a large Mac, with six
slots for add-in cards (though it needs one of those slots for a video
board).;    The Zenith 486/25E (Zenith Data Systems, $8,699, (800) 553-0331)
is not the fastest personal computer Zenith makes, but it's close. It is built
around a 25MHz 486 processor chip. Zenith now makes a 33MHz version that is
about one-third faster. Some competitors have announced imminent 50MHz 486
machines that would have twice the processor speed of the 486/25E.;    The
486/25E comes with a 170-megabyte hard drive and 4 megabytes of memory, almost
identical to the IIfx. I'd raise that 4 megabytes to 8, especially if you use
Windows.;    This Zenith is compact -- it takes up only half as much desk
space as the Mac IIfx -- but has only three open slots for add-in cards. Just
as with the Mac IIfx, it comes without a video card or a monitor -- you buy
those separately. If you want to add other peripherals to it, there's a
standard SCSI port on the back, just as you'll find on the Mac IIfx.;    So
which one is more powerful?;    They have the same amount of memory, though
the Mac can always use all of its memory while the Zenith can only use 640
kilobytes at a time unless you're running Windows. They have about the same
amount of disk capacity and speed. The graphics could be nearly identical
because you choose which video card and monitor to add.;    And therefore, the
decision comes down to floating-point and integer performance, right? Well,
sort of, but not really. The problem is that few people just run calculations
on their computers. They run programs. What matters is how fast the computers
are at running the same application program or at least the same kind of
application. Does PageMaker on the Mac run faster than PageMaker on the PC?
Does Harvard Graphics on the PC run faster than MacDraw Pro on the Mac?;   
One columnist suggests that on this "applications" basis, a IIfx holds the
same power as a 25MHz 386 PC. That would make the 25MHz 486 PC about twice as
fast. Apple publishes a study that says the IIfx is faster than a 33MHz 486
machine. Clearly, it depends on who is running the test and just what is
measured. Generally I'd say the IIfx is about the same speed as the 25MHz 486
machine running Windows software.;    But you don't have to use Windows. You
could run standard PC programs, without Windows, and then you'd be running
faster than the Mac. It might not be as "easy" as a Mac, but it would be
faster.;    My conclusions? The power difference between Mac and PC isn't much
if you're comparing Windows to standard Mac software. However, if you run DOS
software on the PC, you can run faster than a Mac. And if you elude the major
PC brands and buy from a discount house, you can get the PC power for less
money. And Apple had better have some new machines ready soon because the
advent of 50MHz 486 boxes will push PC power beyond the realm that even an
accelerated Mac can reach.;  Z-486/25E, $8,699. From Zenith Data Systems Inc.,
2150 East Lake Cook Road, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089. (800) 553-0331 or (708)
808-5000.;    Macintosh IIfx, $8,669. From Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani
Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014. (408) 996-1010.;    Summary: The Mac IIfx is the
fastest Macintosh Apple makes. The Zenith 486/25E exemplifies the fastest PC
you can buy for the same price from a big-name PC maker. The two machines can
be equipped with identical memory, disk and graphics. When running Windows
software, the Zenith feels about the same speed as the IIfx. However, running
DOS software, the Zenith is faster at the same tasks, though harder to learn
than the Mac. I don't see a big gap between the fastest PCs and Macs, though
Apple will soon need an even faster Mac to compete with the new 50MHz 486 PCs.
When you're considering Mac vs. PC yourself, compare them running the software
you care about. Don't just compare sterile benchmark figures of purified
performance.;    On a scale of one to four, with one indicating poor and four
indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:;    Z-486/25E;
Performance: 4 computers;    Ease of use: 3 computers;    Value: 3 computers;
