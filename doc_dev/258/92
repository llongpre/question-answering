   Microsoft Corp. quietly has discarded its ambitious goal
of dominating printer software, a rich niche market now
controlled by Adobe Systems Inc.
   Nearly two years ago, Microsoft, the world's largest maker
of personal-computer software, declared war on Adobe, vowing
to build a competitive and compatible set of software to
Adobe's own printer programs, which control the way a
computer image or typeface looks on paper. At the time,
Microsoft's threat led to the collapse of Adobe's stock and
fears that Microsoft, the largest supplier of personal
computer software, would obliterate the hugely profitable,
but far-smaller Adobe.

   Signaling its retreat, Microsoft has disbanded its
printer-business unit, accepted the resignation of the
group's chief, Cal Bauer, and folded the remaining staff
members into a larger group developing future versions of
Windows, the company's best-selling program.
   Over the past two years, Adobe, Mountain View, Calif.,
didn't fold in the face of Microsoft's assault, but held its
own, adding corporate customers that build Adobe's software
into their printers. Moreover, Adobe has wooed back into its
fold Apple Computer Inc., its largest customer, which had
joined Microsoft's effort. Adobe also won two important
endorsements from International Business Machines Co. last
year, effectively preventing Microsoft from winning any of
Big Blue's lucrative support in the printer-software field.
   "Microsoft is not going to carry on with a holy war
against Adobe," said Craig Cline, an editor at Seybold Report
on Desktop Publishing, a computer newsletter.
   "We might have been a little naive about what level of
effort was required" to compete with Adobe, said Steve
Shaiman, general manager of system peripherals and
accessories at Microsoft.
   Mr. Shaiman conceded Microsoft no longer seeks to outduel
Adobe in the broad market for printer software, but will
instead concentrate on enhancing the appeal of Windows, one
of the most popular software products on the market, by
"providing great printer software. Just because we're
Microsoft, it doesn't mean we win all the time," Mr. Shaiman
added.
   Microsoft's failure to make a dent in the printer-software
market comes at a time when competitors are claiming the
Redmond, Wash., company unfairly maintains advantages in its
key markets; a Justice Department investigation is under way
into allegations of Microsoft's monopolistic tactics. The
company's inability to make inroads into Adobe's business may
lend credence to Microsoft's claim that it doesn't wield
monopoly power in software.
   The setback in printers also is a personal defeat for
William Gates, Microsoft's chairman. When Mr. Gates announced
his intentions, John Warnock, Adobe's chief executive
officer, promised that the company would make changes in its
business practices to retain its customers. Adobe since has
cut its prices on software sold to computer-equipment
manufacturers and provided more technical details about its
software, making it easier for rivals to create clones.
   Charles Geschke, Adobe's president, said the company
wasn't ready to exult over Microsoft's setback.
   "We haven't heard the last of them," Mr. Geschke said.
