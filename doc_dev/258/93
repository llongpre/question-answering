<LEADPARA>  THERE'S ALWAYS room for a utility. No matter how many improvements you've made
to your personal computer, you'll regularly hear about some new utility
program that could make it faster or easier to use.;   Notice that I said
"could" make it better. Some utilities definitely don't. They cost too much or
they don't work as advertised or they are too hard to install or too hard to
learn or too hard to use or they interfere with some other wonderful utility
you've got.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here are three PC utility programs that are in the gray area, between great
and garbage. For some people, they'll be a boon; for others, they'll waste
time and money. I probably won't end up using any of them, but if they were a
little different I might. And in the case of one, I used to swear by it. (Next
week, I'll look at three Macintosh utilities.);   The one I used to use daily
is LapLink. Now evolved to LapLink Pro (Traveling Software, (206) 483-8088,
$149.95), this program is the premier utility for moving files back and forth
between computers. Why a utility for that? How about using a network or just
walking a floppy disk from one system to the next? Those solutions don't
always work. Networks are tricky and expensive.;   Walking a floppy from here
to there doesn't work if the two computers use different size disks (such as 3
1/2-inch and 5 1/4-inch floppies) or are many miles apart. I used LapLink all
the time back when the world was changing from the larger floppies to the
smaller. I could just hook its cable up from the serial port of one PC to the
serial port of the next (typically from a lap-top to a desk-top), select the
files to send from a menu on screen and then let them spill through the cable.
The transfers were fast and easy. I also used LapLink Mac to move files from
Mac to PC and back.;   LapLink keeps growing, with new features to let you
transfer groups of files at high speed over modems, to automatically send
itself from one system to the next, to compress files while sending, to
automate repetitive file transfers, to synchronize the files in two
directories. To operate through cellular modems, LapLink Pro has even cut the
weight of the cables so they're easier to carry and has added a parallel port
cable for faster transfers.;   I like that synchronize command. It will copy
files with the latest date and time over older files of the same name. I'm
also excited about the "blackbird" technology that Traveling is putting into
LapLink. This is a software core that lets two PCs communicate no matter what
hardware they're using, avoiding some of the trouble of manually setting
parity, stop bits, protocols and other such arcane technical stuff.;   LapLink
is still easy to install and use. But I don't need it anymore. Oh, I might use
it if it included those PC-Mac abilities (transferring files between those two
still isn't smooth), but all my PC work is now done with 3 1/2-inch floppy
disks. And after installing my applications on both machines, all I really
need to copy back and forth are my document files. When I move data long
distances, I move only a few files at a time and get by with my
telecommunications program. If I were creating graphics, page layouts or color
images that wouldn't fit on a single floppy, I might again turn to LapLink.
But for me, this is a utility whose time has gone.;   Last Resort (Working
Software, (408) 423-5696, $49.95) is a "typing recovery" program. A typing
recovery utility program helps you recover typed text you accidentally deleted
from a file. Or it's type you intentionally deleted but now want back. Last
Resort installs more easily than any other program I've ever seen, loads into
memory and watches every key you press on the keyboard. It stores all of the
letter keys, and backspaces, into a file on disk. You can later open that file
to find anything you've typed. For instance, imagine you were using
WordPerfect to write a proposal and along the way typed and then deleted a
paragraph of text. Suddenly your colleague bursts into your cubicle and yells,
"Stop! Don't delete that paragraph about XYZ. It's back in the final
proposal!" With Last Resort, you don't have to try to remember what was in the
paragraph. You just open that special file, search for the paragraph you want
(stored as when you typed it, not when you deleted it), remove any backspaces
from it and put it back into your document.;   Unfortunately, Last Resort
doesn't work with Windows programs. I do most of my PC writing now with Word
for Windows, so Last Resort isn't open to me. But if I were using WordPerfect
under DOS, or any other such DOS program where lots of typing passed through
my fingers, I'd seriously consider Last Resort. (This is one of those
functions all computers ought to have naturally. It should be built into the
operating system.);   MenuWorks Total Security (PC Dynamics, (800) 888-1741,
$149.95) is a new and improved version of MenuWorks, a utility I reviewed
earlier this year. That older MenuWorks was a "menu builder" program. It let
you create menus and screen displays and let you build macro commands to link
those menus and displays to your programs and to DOS. By exploiting the
MenuWorks options, you could customize a PC. For instance, you could use
MenuWorks to set up a PC for a legal office. Turn that PC on, and a menu would
appear on screen: 1) Create Memo, 2) Create Brief, 3) Other Word Processing,
4) Check Expenses, 5) Research. When the PC operator pushed the 1 key,
WordPerfect would automatically start, with a memo template on screen; 2 and 3
would offer different templates; 4 would bring up an accounting program; 5
would dial an on-line legal library.;   The operator wouldn't have to know
about finding and starting programs, loading templates or any of that.;   The
Total Security part of MenuWorks means that you can now also protect your PC
and your files. You can assign all sorts of passwords to your PC, preventing
"unauthorized" types from reading a file, using a program, issuing any
commands or even from starting the PC. Along with those codes and passwords,
you can track the usage of a single PC, recording who used what and for how
long.;   I didn't take to MenuWorks before, finding it too complicated for my
own tasks. But even then, I saw how it could be a wonderful tool for an expert
tailoring a PC to a particular novice's needs. With these new security
features, I think it is even more suited to such work.; LapLink Pro, for PC or
compatible with at least 440K free RAM and DOS 2.11 or later. $149.95. From
Traveling Software, 18702 North Creek Parkway, Bothell, WA 98011. (206)
483-8088.;   Last Resort, for PC or compatible with DOS 3.0 or higher. $49.95.
From Working Software, Box 1844, Santa Cruz, CA 95061-1844. (408) 423-5696.;  
 MenuWorks Total Security, for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, a hard
disk and DOS 3.1 or later. $149.95. From PC Dynamics, 31332 Via Colinas No.
102, Westlake Village, CA 91362. (800) 888-1741.; Summary: LapLink Pro remains
my favorite program for transferring files from one PC to another at high
speed over cables or modems. The latest version offers faster transfers and
more automation. I just wish it handled Macintosh-to-PC transfers as well.
Last Resort can remember every key you press while using DOS or DOS
applications. That lets you recover anything you've typed, such as a paragraph
typed, then deleted from a WordPerfect document days before. Unfortunately, it
doesn't work for Windows programs. MenuWorks Total Security adds passwords and
file encoding to the menu building of previous versions. It can protect your
documents, programs or even your PC from unauthorized lookers and users.
Experts building PC systems for novices will like it; novices will find it too
difficult to set up and use.; On a scale of one to four, with one indicating
poor and four indicating excellent, here's how the product rates:; LapLink
Pro; 3 computers; Last Resort; 3 computers; MenuWorks Total Security; 3
computers  </TEXT>
