<TEXT>  MS-DOS 5, for PC or compatible with at least 512K RAM, 2.8MB free disk space
and previous version of DOS. $99.95 as upgrade from previous MS-DOS version.
From Microsoft Corp., One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. (206)
882-8080.;    DR DOS 5.0, for PC or compatible with at least 256K RAM and
1.2MB of free hard disk space. $79 as upgrade from previous DR DOS or MS-DOS
version, $199.95 as first-time buy. $19.95 option for Magellan. From Digital
Research, Box DRI, 70 Garden Court, Monterey, CA 93942. (408) 649-3896.;   
MS-DOS 5 is the best DOS in years, smaller and more frugal with memory than
previous versions of DOS, easy to install and equipped with a fine text
editor, a decent task-switcher, more command options and an undelete function
to recover lost files. However, DR DOS 5.0 with the Magellan utility option
has all of that (except the task switcher) and more. Both are good programs,
and everyone with a PC should upgrade to one or the other. I prefer DR DOS.
(But I want to thank Microsoft for the biodegradable disk packaging in DOS 5.)
(Reviewed 7/7/91);    MS-DOS 5; 3 computers;    DR DOS 5; 4 computers; (hbox);
Blaupunkt Travelpilot, $4,200. From Blaupunkt Bosch Telecom, Robert Bosch
Corp., Sales Group Mobile Communications Division, 2800 South 25th Ave.,
Broadview, IL 60153. (708) 865-5200.;    Blaupunkt's Travelpilot is a
specialized car computer that tells you where you are. Using wheel sensors, it
can detect your car's direction and speed -- matching that to the grid of
streets stored on a CD-ROM disk. It displays your current position on a 4
1/2-inch screen in the car and lets you locate and see paths to any other
place on the screen's map. It works well and easily but is too expensive for
individuals. It may be practical already for delivery, sales, public safety,
field service and other organizations that can get fleet discounts and can
team the Travelpilot with communications services for sending and receiving
the latest information on clients and assignments. (Reviewed 6/30/91);    3
computers; (hbox); SuperStor, for IBM PC or compatible with at least 640
kilobytes of random-access memory and DOS 3.2 or later. $129. From AddStor
Inc., 3905 Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025. (415) 688-0465.;   
SuperDisk!, for Apple Macintosh Plus or later with System 6.0 or System 7.0.
$89. From Alysis Software Corp., 1231 31st Ave., San Francisco, CA 94122.
(415) 566-2263.;    "On-the-fly" compression programs can automatically
squeeze program and data files smaller so they'll occupy less disk space and
can be more quickly stored and retrieved. SuperStor is a good example for PCs
and can easily double your PC disk capacity. SuperDisk! does the same for
Macs, though it requires you to explicitly name the files or folders you want
to compress. SuperDisk! makes up for that flaw with another fine feature -- it
can create "auto-expanding" compressed files that any Macintosh can receive
and unsqueeze even without its own copy of SuperDisk!. (Reviewed 6/23/91);
