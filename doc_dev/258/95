<LEADPARA>  ONE OF THE most vital jobs of a computer's operating system -- its basic
software -- is storing and retrieving information on disks at the request of
programs like word processors or spreadsheets.;    Unfortunately, neither DOS
(the operating system for IBM and compatible personal computers) or Apple's
Macintosh operating system offers data compression, a technique to snip blank
areas out of graphics images, cut repeated spaces and characters from text and
so on. While some files can be compressed just a bit, others can be reduced to
as little as one-tenth their initial size, letting you put more files on a
disk. And the computer stores and retrieves smaller files more quickly.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The disadvantage of compression is that squishing or unsquishing each file
takes time and requires extra work from the computer's microprocessor. If you
have compression hardware -- a special chip tailored to the task -- you don't
notice the delay. But if you depend on a software utility for the work, which
is a less-expensive choice, you might.;    Whether this bothers you depends on
how often your programs read and write disk information and on how fast your
processor chip is. (With a fast processor like a 486 chip, compression can
actually speed operations because the squishing and unsquishing time is so
much less than the time saved by reading and writing smaller files.);    The
practicality of compression depends on your object and patience. If you have
huge graphics files that eat up too much disk space, you'll probably be happy
enough with a special program that you must call for explicitly, one that
squishes them as much as possible.;    But if you want to compress everything
to make more effective use of your disk space, you'll want a compression
program that's automatic yet unobtrusive. These "on-the-fly" programs are
available for both DOS and Macintosh computers.;    SuperStor (AddStor, (415)
688-0465, $129) adds to any personal computer's DOS operating system. It
installs automatically, though it asks you to answer some questions about
intimidating terms such as "mounting" a drive. Once it is installed, however,
it runs completely automatically. Then it not only compresses and decompresses
all files with no more trouble from you, but also it uses the disk more
efficiently by decreasing the minimum stored chunk size from 2,048 bytes to
512. (DOS wastes some disk space by insisting on that minimum size.);    My
Zenith Data Systems 486-based PC compatible seemed like the perfect candidate
for SuperStor. It has a fast processor and a 180-megabyte hard-disk drive.
(That may seem like a lot of storage space, but if you have Windows, desk-top
publishing and multimedia in mind, you can always use more space.) After I
installed SuperStor -- which took about 15 minutes -- I had the equivalent of
a 340-megabyte hard disk.;    After that, I didn't even need to know that
SuperStor was in town. I started and ran programs as always, but I had more
room to move.;    SuperStor also will double the size of a floppy disk (or
even of a random-access memory disk). However, I'm a bit less comfortable with
that prospect because I want floppies that other PCs can read.;    I won't be
completely at ease with SuperStor until I've used it for a while and don't
find conflicts with my programs. And there are some utilities that it is known
not to work with, including some parts of popular packages like PC Tools. But
in general, it has everything you could want for simple, automatic
compression, from the ability to handle large hard disks (up to 512 megabytes)
to fitting its program code into high DOS memory (to keep as much of your 640
kilobytes of main memory free as possible).;    SuperDisk! (Alysis, (415)
566-2263, $89) can increase your Macintosh disk space, but it doesn't work in
just the same way SuperStor does on the PC.;    SuperDisk! is easier to
install, largely because Mac software is easier to install than PC stuff. You
copy the SuperDisk! program into the Mac's system folder and restart your Mac.
Thereafter, any files you name with a ".s" at the end are automatically
compressed when out of use and automatically decompressed when needed again.
You may also name folders with a ".s" at the end, and then all files within
the folders are compressed and decompressed.;    The compression is fast. For
instance, I compressed a 280K file down to 50K in just four seconds on the
relatively slow Mac Portable. You can choose faster or slower compression and
tighter (which takes longer) or larger (which is faster) results.;    You may
assign passwords to compressed files to limit who can decompress them. You can
also make "auto-expanding" files, squished files that any Macintosh can
decompress, even those without SuperDisk! (The decompression software is built
into the squashed file.) This is very handy if you want to send files to other
Mac owners (smaller files cost less to send through a modem). I even like
SuperDisk!'s cute graphics (like a crushed cola can showing you the
compression progress) and thorough on-line help and explanations.;    My only
beef with SuperDisk! is that compressed files aren't always recognized by
their programs. My TouchBase program couldn't find its data-base file when
that file was compressed, so all of my phone numbers and addresses were out of
reach. In other words, you cannot just compress your entire disk, as SuperStor
allows you to do on the PC.;    Both SuperStor and SuperDisk! are inexpensive
ways to get a lot more disk space. They're both easy to use, too, though with
a few rough spots. And they're much faster than I expected -- fast enough to
prevent bothersome delays (though I didn't test SuperStor's pace on a slow PC
like the PC itself or an XT). If you've been cramped lately and have already
reorganized, thinned and defragmented your disks, look to compression for some
elbow room.; SuperStor, for IBM PC or compatible with at least 640 kilobytes
of random-access memory and DOS 3.2 or later. $129. From AddStor Inc., 3905
Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025. (415) 688-0465.;    SuperDisk!, for
Apple Macintosh Plus or later with System 6.0 or System 7.0. $89. From Alysis
Software Corp., 1231 31st Ave., San Francisco, CA 94122. (415) 566-2263.;
Summary: "On-the-fly" compression programs can automatically squeeze program
and data files smaller so they'll occupy less disk space and can be more
quickly stored and retrieved. SuperStor is a good example for PCs and can
easily double your PC disk capacity. SuperDisk! does the same for Macs, though
it requires you to explicitly name the files or folders you want to compress.
SuperDisk! makes up for that flaw with another fine feature -- it can create
"auto-expanding" compressed files that any Macintosh can receive and unsqueeze
even without its own copy of SuperDisk!.; On a scale of one to four, with one
indicating poor and four indicating excellent, here's how the products rate:;
SuperStor; Performance: 4 computers;    Ease of use: 3 computers;    Value: 3
