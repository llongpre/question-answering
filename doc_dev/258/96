<LEADPARA>  Adobe Systems Inc. announced Monday it will move its world headquarters from
Mountain View to the planned $170 million University Centre office-retail
complex in East Palo Alto.;    The announcement by the $169 million software
manufacturer -- the first Silicon Valley high-tech firm to be headquartered in
East Palo Alto -- ended speculation that legal delays and the recession would
stop the biggest development ever in that city.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Adobe, the sole commercial tenant, will lease two-thirds of the
665,000-square-foot complex that will be built on 12 acres at Bayshore Freeway
and University Avenue.;    "This is the first time a corporate office this
size will cross the border to come to East Palo Alto," Mayor Warnell Coats
said. "It says to other developers that you can do business in East Palo Alto.
It's a major breakthrough.";    After nine months of negotiations, the
University Centre developer, DeMonet Industries Inc., entered into a limited
partnership with Adobe, which has agreed to invest up to $6 million to
redevelop the property.;    The company, with 500 employees locally, was
running out of space at its Charleston Road offices in Mountain View, said
John Warnock, Adobe's chief executive officer. After searching from Belmont to
San Jose, company executives settled on the East Palo Alto site.;    "This
exactly fits our needs," Warnock said. "We never considered it a risk. We
think it's a great location.";    Without a major tenant such as Adobe, it
would have been impossible to secure a construction loan for the project, said
Joaquin DeMonet, president of DeMonet Industries. DeMonet already has spent $5
million on lawsuits, site studies and negotiations for the project.;    "After
six years and $5 million, a lot of developers might have cut and run," DeMonet
said. "But our commitment to the community was unshakable.";    The project
was held up for nearly three years by lawsuits filed by Menlo Park, Palo Alto
and Palo Alto's Crescent Park Neighborhood Association over concerns about the
size and scope of the project.;    All three were settled last month after
DeMonet agreed to scale back the project and to pay for traffic studies and
improvements.;    The liquor stores, hardware stores and other small
businesses that now make up the Whiskey Gulch area will give way to two
nine-story office buildings occupied by Adobe, 15,000 square feet of retail
space and, if economically feasible, a 230-room hotel, DeMonet said.;    Next,
DeMonet will begin acquisition of the properties in the area. If that failed,
the city would have to begin condemnation procedures.;    East Palo Alto will
receive a $7.2 million community benefits fee from the project, a sum equal to
its annual budget. The city also has a 20 percent interest in net profits from
the project.;    Additionally, the city will reap $60 million over the next 30
years in property taxes. Of that, $1.5 million will go to the sanitary sewer
district; $5 million to the fire district; $12 million to the Ravenswood
Elementary School District; $4.8 million to the Sequoia Union High School
District; $1 million to the San Mateo County Office of Education; $2 million
to the San Mateo County Junior College District; and $33.7 million for
low-cost housing, senior services and training programs for the city.;    The
loss of Adobe is a disappointment to Mountain View. Adobe, which produces the
industry-leading PostScript system that controls laser printers, contributes
about $135,000 in sales tax revenue to Mountain View, according to Bruce
Nakao, Adobe's vice president for finance.;    "We're concerned whenever a
major employer or business leaves," Mountain View City Manager Kevin Duggan
said. "But we're confident we'll be able to get other quality tenants into
that area which is so in demand.";    East Palo Alto officials and community
representatives hailed the Adobe announcement, particularly since another
high-tech manufacturer, Sun Microsystems, Inc., the leading maker of computer
work stations, backed out last year on plans to build a high-tech research
park in the city because of opposition from the city council.  </TEXT>
