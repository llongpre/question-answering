<LEADPARA>  International Business Machines Corp. formally introduced the second
generation of its beleaguered OS/2 operating system software last week at the
Comdex fall trade show. Company officials say it will be available in March
1992 -- even though IBM had all but promised it would be ready by the end of
the year.;   The officials said they decided to postpone the release after
receiving requests for new features from many of the 20,000 IBM customers who
have been testing the software.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "In the larger scheme of things, three months doesn't matter very much,"
said Amy Wohl, president of Wohl &amp; Associates of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., a
consulting company. "But it is going to cost IBM dearly in terms of marketing
momentum. The big mistake they made was in being so firm about shipping by the
end of the year and then deciding to add to the feature set.";   Discussions
of the release date should not obscure the many virtues of the new software,
which appears to be far superior to Windows on a technical level. OS/2 2.0 can
run Windows software without modification, along with DOS programs and
previous versions of OS/2 software.;   "It's a better DOS than DOS, a better
Windows than Windows and a better OS/2 than OS/2 Version 1.3," said Lee
Reiswig, general manager of IBM's system software development effort.;  
That's easy for him to say. But in demonstrations at Comdex, Reiswig showed
how OS/2 2.0 can run the DOS-based WordPerfect word processor in one window on
screen, Microsoft's Windows-based Excel spreadsheet in another, an OS/2 1.3
communications program in a third window and a new OS/2 2.0 application in a
fourth window, with all programs active at the same time.;   This ability is
called multitasking, and it is one of the great advantages of OS/2 over DOS.
Users can grab information from one application and easily paste it into
another.;   What will be central to the acceptance of OS/2 2.0 is the
availability of useful application software, like data-base managers and
spreadsheets, that take specific advantage of its 32-bit operating system.;  
IBM's chief personal computer executive, James Cannavino, said more than 700
OS/2 2.0 applications from 500 software companies are in the works.;   "The
key is, when do those 700 applications ship?" said John McCarthy, a senior
analyst with Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. "If it's dribbleware,
they're doomed.";   John Soyring, an OS/2 manager, responded that 25 percent
to 30 percent of the anticipated 700 programs will be ready within 30 days
after the operating system ships in March. Lotus Development Corp. and
WordPerfect Corp. were among those vowing early support for OS/2 2.0.;   As a
32-bit operating system, OS/2 2.0 is capable of processing information at
double the rate of DOS, Windows and earlier versions of OS/2. Overall system
performance will not double because many other factors are involved, but in
general, 32-bit software will operate much more quickly than 16-bit software
running on identical machines.;   The drawback, at least for most users, is
that OS/2 2.0 requires a lot of overhead in order to juggle such tasks.
Reiswig said the new operating system will require a minimum configuration of
a 386SX microprocessor, 4 megabytes of random-access memory and a 60-megabyte
hard disk.;   Companies are notorious for understating operating system
requirements, so plan on a fast 386- or 486-based system, 8 megabytes of
memory and at least 100 megabytes of disk storage.;   OS/2 needs such hardware
support because it is essentially three operating systems rolled into one. It
will come on 13 diskettes and will consume anywhere from 18 to 30 megabytes of
hard disk space, depending on which features are installed. In other words, it
needs half the hard disk space on a PC equipped with a 40- or 60-megabyte hard
disk -- a demand that may cause many users to balk. Yet many people who use
Windows today are giving up almost as much of their disks without realizing
it.;   Some major software developers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude
before committing programming resources to the 32-bit version of OS/2.;   As
rewritten, OS/2 is expected to appeal to individuals and small-business users
as well as to the large corporate customers that are IBM's traditional power
base. With the necessary hardware, OS/2 2.0 appears to be attractive even if
it is used merely as a replacement for DOS (suggested list price will be $195
or $149 for current users of DOS or OS/2, IBM officials said).;   And it is
much easier to use than DOS, thanks to a new graphical set of commands called
the Workplace Manager.;   The Workplace Manager makes it much easier to manage
applications, files and printers. To print a document, for example, the user
selects an icon representing the file and, using a mouse, drags it over to an
icon representing a printer. Click. That's it.;   Even the installation
process has been transformed by graphics. Users choose which OS/2 features
they want by clicking on boxes on a checklist. To save space, for example, a
user might not care to install the built-in PS/2 games or the simple
spreadsheet. The memory requirements of each feature are listed, which is
helpful.  </TEXT>
