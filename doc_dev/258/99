want one - Paul Taylor cuts through the jargon and offers advice on buying a
personal computer

It is more than a decade since the first IBM PCs appeared on desktops, but
according to recent surveys, many businessmen and women are still
uncomfortable with PC technology.
Help is usually at hand in a large organisation, either from the whiz-kids
in the information department - assuming they can be torn away from the
latest technical journal - or from less intimidated colleagues.
But the small business computer user, or potential user, must seek other
solutions.
The first issues to confront the uninitiated are often the basic questions -
do I need a computer and what can it do for me?
Most computer advertisers and salesmen would like potential customers to
believe that life without a PC is barely worth living and that a PC on the
end of a desk can do just about everything.
In reality many basic office functions, such as keeping a diary or simple
bookkeeping, are more easily and efficiently achieved with paper, pen and
calculator.
Basic data, like sales figures or customer addresses, do not miraculously
appear in a computer's electronic brain.
They have to be put there, usually via the keyboard.
What computers, or rather the software programs that run on them, are
particularly good at, is organising and manipulating information, and
performing complex or repetitive tasks or calculations.
Examples include combining a mailing list of customers compiled on a
database program and a letter written on a word-processing program to send
out details of a special offer.
They are also good at examining what happens to profits if suppliers
increase prices; or calculating tax, national insurance contributions and
pay for employees each week, using a spreadsheet programme.
By far the most common use of PCs is for accounting. A recent survey found
that more than half the small companies with a computer had bought it for
this purpose.
The other main use is as a word-processor, although this may mean that the
machine ends up being little more than a glorified typewriter.
But if you still think you need a computer, the next question is which one?
A quick glance through any of the dozen-plus computer magazines on sale in
local newsagents is enough to deter all but the most determined.
Similarly a visit to a High Street electrical shop will probably only
confuse - most of the machines likely to be on display are underpowered and
overpriced - and the shop assistant is most unlikely to be of any help.
There are, however, other ways to go about buying a computer.
Specialist computer stores are sometimes willing to provide advice, unless
they are of the pile-them-high-sell-them-fast variety.
However, many potential customers also find computer stores intimidating -
after all, who wants to show off their ignorance to a youth half their age?
For those with lots of money to spend, there are computer consultants who
will advise on purchase, find and set up the equipment, load the software
and teach the customer how to use the new toy.
But such advice does not come cheap. A morning's training on a new
accounting package, for example, can cost several hundred pounds.
The only real alternative is often self-help, which need not be terrifying.
In many of the computer magazines there are sections designed specifically
for the novice.
For example, What Micro magazine has a section called 'How to buy' while
Computer Shopper has a buyer's glossary and a section dealing with buying
equipment each month. This has also been put together in a useful Pounds
2.95 book called PC Buying Questions.
Other books for learners include the PC Novice's Handbook - which includes
jargon-busting sections on hardware and software and a chapter on shopping -
the PC Crash Course and Survival Guide, and What to do when a MICRO lands on
your desk.
The standard advice on buying a computer used to be to decide on the
software first. This is less important these days because the IBM-compatible
standard is nearly all-pervasive - the honourable exception being the
user-friendly Apple Macintosh computer family.
Most PC's have become interchangeable machines which will run most of the
serious business software - and the growing number of PC games too.
However it is important to remember that the new software packages require
some pretty heavy duty hardware.
Thus a basic business machine today would be an IBM-compatible based on
Intel's 80386 processor chip with at least 2-Megabytes of Ram (random access
memory), a 40Mb hard disk, a VGA colour screen, mouse pointing device and
Windows, Microsoft's hugely successful operating environment which has sold
9m copies worldwide.
Such a machine has more power than most traditional mainframe computers.
But fortunately computer prices are continuing to tumble.
For example, Dell which pioneered direct sales in the UK, sells its 325P
machine with colour monitor and a 50Mb hard disk for Pounds 1,149 (excluding
VAT).
These days the direct sales channel is well established and most direct sale
computer manufactures provide an on-site maintenance contract for a
reasonable fee and lifetime telephone support - for all those problems,
large and small, that the manual does not answer.
