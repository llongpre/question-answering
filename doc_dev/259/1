   As the first woman to describe the
liftoff of a spaceship with astronauts aboard, NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone gained a new perspective on journalists.
   ``I'm used to dealing with the media,'' she said. ``That's all I
do all day long. But it's not on me usually.''
   Monday morning, Malone, 27, had served as commentator for the
liftoff of the shuttle Discovery, sitting just a few seats from the
launch director in the firing room.
   Monday afternoon, Malone was back in her office at Kennedy Space
Center press headquarters, accepting congratulations from coworkers
and being questioned by reporters who considered her a story subject
rather than a story source.
   She said she was pleased with her performance, even though she
jumped the gun once.
   ``I said the ice team had already made their report to
management,'' Malone said. ``And I thought that they had. This was
one of those times when there was a lot going on. It was just a few
minutes later, then they came on and gave their report.''
   The countdown was longer than usual as fog and high winds delayed
the launch by nearly two hours. But Malone said her part went more
smoothly than she had expected ``because the launch team did such a
good job they made my job easier.''
   ``I think I did alright.''
   Malone expressed surprise that journalists were asking her about
her role as ``the first woman'' to do her job.
   ``I guess (it's) because they've always heard a male voice during
commentary,'' she said.
   ``There are so many woman newscasters. I don't really consider
this job that much different from what they're doing.''
   Malone first came to the Kennedy Space Center in 1982 as a
journalism student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, where
she earned a bachelor's degree in 1984.
   To prepare for her debut, Malone provided launch commentary for
some unmanned Atlas Centaur and Delta launches and for the early
portions of some space shuttle countdowns and hired a voice coach.
   She is scheduled to serve as commentator again in August, when
Discovery makes its ninth mission.
