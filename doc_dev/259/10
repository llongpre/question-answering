   The crew of space shuttle Atlantis
concluded a two-day countdown rehearsal Friday and traveled to
Washington for a meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The practice session, intended to mimic the 24 hours leading to
an actual launch, went smoothly despite two computer glitches that
delayed the end of the countdown, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said.
   Soon after wrapping up the rehearsal, the five astronauts boarded
their T-38 jets for a flight to Washington. White House officials
said Quayle planned to meet commander Don Williams and his crewmates
Saturday at breakfast. Williams comes from Quayle's home state of
Indiana.
   ``Mr. Quayle expressed a desire to say hello to the crew sometime
before we fly,'' Williams told reporters Thursday. ``I invited him
to be a launch guest, but we'll be pretty busy and won't be able to
visit with him on launch morning.''
   The rehearsal ended at 11:10 a.m. EDT, about 10 minutes later
than planned, because launch crews needed extra time to investigate
two problems in computers monitoring the shuttle's systems.
   The astronauts and their support crews carried the dress
rehearsal to its finish, even though stormy weather near the Kennedy
Space Center would have prevented an actual liftoff.
   Atlantis' liftoff is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 12. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration will not set a firm
date until a two-day flight readiness review is completed Oct. 3.
   The astronauts were aboard Atlantis for the final two hours of
the countdown during the dry run. In addition to Williams, the crew
members are pilot Mike McCully and mission specialists Ellen Baker,
Franklin Chang Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
   During the first day of the five-day flight, the astronauts are
to dispatch the nuclear-powered Galileo spacecraft on the start of a
six-year voyage to explore Jupiter and its moons.
   Anti-nuclear activists have said they will try to block the
launch, either by court action or by trespassing at the launch site,
because the probe is powered by two generators fueled by
plutonium-238. They are afraid an accident during launch would
sprinkle hazardous radioactive fallout on communities surrounding
the Kennedy Space Center.
   Similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power on 22
previous U.S. space flights, including the six manned Apollo moon
missions and the Voyager 2 probe, which recently sent back pictures
of the planet Neptune.
   The five astronauts on the mission say they are confident the
nuclear generators are safe.
