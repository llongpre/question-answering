   The misshapen mirror in the Hubble Space
Telescope and the hydrogen leaks that grounded the shuttle fleet
are jolting the U.S. space agency just as it is recovering from the
Challenger disaster and fixing its sights on Mars.
   In the 4{ years since Challenger exploded on launch at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida, killing seven astronauts, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration has struggled to
rebuild an image that has been marked since its infancy by
tribulations as well as triumphs.
   In January, President Bush asked Congress to increase the
agency's budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 by 17.5
percent to $14.1 billion, including a start on his plan to send
astronauts back to the moon and then on to Mars within 30 years.
   A bill containing $14.29 billion passed the House on Thursday.
Committee action is scheduled in the Senate in September.
   On Wednesday, NASA announced that a focus flaw had crippled
Hubble, the $1.5 billion orbiting laboratory it sent into space in
April with such high hopes. Officials of Hughes Danbury Optical
Co., which manufactured the telescope's two main mirrors, said
experiments had shown that one of the mirrors was incorrectly
shaped.
   The telescope had been designed to permit astronomers for the
first time to peer 14 billion light years into space. Instead, said
NASA, it will do little better than telescopes on Earth.
   ``It is very disappointing, extremely disappointing,'' said Kim
Leschly of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on science, technology and space, opened hearings on
the matter Friday. Investigations were also planned by
appropriations subcommittees.
   Then, on Friday, NASA announced at the Kennedy Space Center that
a hydrogen leak had been found on the space shuttle Atlantis. A
similar leak had grounded the shuttle Columbia in May.
   NASA said all shuttle flights would be suspended until the leak
problem was fixed.
   After Challenger blew up, NASA was criticized for an
overambitious shuttle flight schedule, for failing to heed warnings
about the design of the shuttle's booster rockets and for not
keeping a ready reserve of expendable rockets to back up the
shuttle.
   Now, questions have been raised about testing programs that
should have detected the shuttle's hydrogen leaks. NASA also has
admitted it tested the two Hubble mirrors individually on the
ground, but not together, in order to save money.
   ``NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach,'' Gore said at
Friday's hearing. Later, he added: ``We owe it to the taxpayers to
find out what went wrong, how to fix it and make sure it never
happens again.''
   Since its formation in 1958, NASA has had moment after moment of
glory _ on May 5, 1961, when Alan Shepherd's suborbital flight made
him the first American in space; the next year, when John Glenn
became the first in orbit; on Christmas Eve 1968, when a three-man
crew orbited the moon; and man's first landing on the moon, at 4:17
p.m. EDT on Sunday, July 20, 1969.
   But there also have been disasters. On Dec. 6, 1957, with NASA
still in the future and the Navy running the fledgling space
program, the first U.S. effort to launch a space satellite ended in
failure with a rocket explosion at Cape Canaveral, Fla. On Jan. 27,
1967, a spark traced to faulty wiring touched off an inferno that
incinerated astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee
inside the Apollo 1 cabin at the Kennedy launch pad. On Jan. 28,
1986, Challenger exploded moments after liftoff, killing the seven
aboard, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.
   In ensuing months, unmanned Titan and Delta rockets also
exploded. In July 1987, four workers were injured and an
Atlas-Centaur rocket was severely damaged when a work platform
struck the booster stage on the Cape Canaveral launch pad. On Oct.
17, 1988, a flash fire caused minor damage to the Magellan Venus
spacecraft.
   NASA, once the coddled darling of Congress, began facing more
critical scrutiny. Officials of the space agency complained that it
had been weakened, its work force down, many of its top managers
gone and its array of contractors dwindling.
   Bush said he wanted to reverse the trend. In addition to the
sharply increased appropriation for next year, he called for an
even bigger boost in spending authority for projects that wouldn't
be paid off until later years. He spoke of returning to the moon
and then beginning manned exploration of Mars early in the next
century.
   The past week's debacles cast a shadow on this optimistic
picture.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairwoman of the appropriations
subcommittee that screens NASA spending bills, summed up the
frustration of critics in Congress:
   ``They have had 10 years to put this together and spent $2.8
billion to be able to get it right. Now we find that the Hubble
telescope has a cataract.''
