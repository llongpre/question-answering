   Five astronauts who will dispatch a
nuclear-powered probe to Jupiter in October concluded a practice
countdown aboard space shuttle Atlantis today, finishing up a bit
late because of minor computer problems.
   The astronauts and their support crews carried the dress
rehearsal for launch day to its finish, even though stormy weather
near the Kennedy Space Center would have prevented an actual liftoff.
   The countdown ended at 11:10 a.m., about 10 minutes later than
planned. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said launch crews needed extra
time to fix two problems in computers monitoring the shuttle's
systems.
   Despite the problems, she said, ``Everything proceeded very
smoothly in this dress rehearsal. It was a good test run for
everyone on the launch team and also for the astronauts.''
   The astronauts were aboard Atlantis for the final two hours of
the count. It was the last time they will be inside the space
shuttle until launch day.
   Commander Don Williams told reporters Thursday he and his
crewmates looked forward to the exercise ``because it's a real treat
to get on board the ship ... the ship is pretty special to us.''
   The other crew members are pilot Mike McCully and mission
specialists Shannon Lucid, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Ellen Baker.
   The countdown test, which began Thursday, covers the final 24
hours of an actual countdown and provides training for both the
astronauts and the launch team.
   Atlantis' liftoff is scheduled for Oct. 12, but NASA will not set
a firm date until the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness
review on Oct. 3.
   During the first day of the five-day flight, the astronauts are
to release the Galileo spacecraft on the start of a six-year voyage
to explore Jupiter. The craft is to orbit the planet and fire a
probe into its atmosphere.
   Anti-nuclear activists have said they will try to block the
launch, either through court action or with their bodies, because
Galileo is powered by two nuclear generators fueled by plutonium-238
dioxide.
   If the activists cannot get a federal court injunction, ``we are
going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the launch pad
to halt the launch,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator for the Florida
Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of the opposition groups.
   A recent space agency safety analysis concluded ``the probability
of an accident resulting in a release of plutonium ranges from
1-in-2,500 to 1-in-2 million and any release from these low
probability events would be very small.''
   Similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power for 22
earlier U.S. spacecraft, including six manned Apollo moon flights
and the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which recently sent back pictures of
the planet Neptune.
   The five astronauts flying the mission say they are confident the
nuclear generators are safe.
   ``I wish everybody had the insight I had and the access to the
reports that I've read, because I think if they did they would not
have any of the fears they are talking about,'' Baker told reporters
Thursday.
   Asked about the possibility of the protesters physically stopping
the launch, Lucid said, ``The Kennedy Space Center has real good
security folks here, and they're working very hard to protect the
vehicle and protect the premises, and I expect that's the way it
will be. So I don't expect any delays because of that.''
