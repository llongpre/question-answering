   A countdown test will be conducted
Tuesday in a major rehearsal for the first space shuttle launch
since the Challenger disaster.
   The launch team will assemble in the control center for the final
three hours of a simulated countdown, with a mock liftoff of shuttle
Discovery planned for 9:50 a.m. The exercise will be a realistic
preparation for the actual launch, set for Aug. 31.
   Following the countdown, mission control center in Houston will
assume control of a make-believe flight and will guide a shuttle
crew, operating in a Houston simulator, through an abort situation
in which the astronauts make an emergency landing at Kennedy Space
Center.
   The participating astronauts will be Loren Shriver, James
Wetherbee and Franklin Chang-Diaz. Observing will be the five-man
crew that will fly Discovery, commanded by astronaut Rick Hauck.
   The launch team here has held countdown rehearsals every month
for several months, but Tuesday's test will be the first to tie
together the Kennedy and Johnson space centers, the mission
management team and all the other elements that will be in place on
launch day.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman Lisa
Malone said the practice ``will validate to the fullest extent
possible the complete launch process system.'' She said it will
exercise procedure and personnel changes that have occurred since
the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986,
killing the crew of seven.
   Discovery is in a hangar at Kennedy Space Center, undergoing
final checks following a major overhaul of systems. Many of the
changes were the result of the investigation into the Challenger
accident, which was blamed on a faulty joint in a solid fuel booster
rocket.
   On June 16, Discovery is to be moved into an assembly building
for mating with its two solid fuel boosters and external fuel tank.
Transfer to the launch pad is planned for June 27.
   The spaceship's three main engines will be test-fired on the pad
in a critical test July 19.
   Officials said the current Aug. 31 launch target can be met if no
critical problems crop up during testing here and at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah, where two more full-scale tests are planned
of the redesigned booster rocket. The Utah tests are slated for June
14 and July 26.
