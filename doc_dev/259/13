   Three women from the military,
including a student test pilot expected to be the first female
space shuttle pilot, are among 23 people selected as astronaut
candidates, NASA announced Wednesday.
   It marked the first time that female military officers have been
tapped as astronaut candidates, although some have applied for the
position in the past, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said.
   The list also includes Los Angeles native Ellen Ochoa, the first
female Hispanic selection.
   The three military women are Air Force Maj. Eileen M. Collins,
the first woman to be named a shuttle pilot candidate, Air Force
Capt. Susan J. Helms of Charlotte, N.C., and Army Capt. Nancy J.
Sherlock of Wilmington, Del. Helms and Sherlock were chosen as
mission specialist candidates.
   Collins, an Elmira, N.Y., native who is a student test pilot at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., also may become the first female to
command a shuttle mission. Shuttle pilots usually fly once as the
pilot before being named commander of a flight.
   In all, seven pilot candidates and 16 mission specialists were
selected from a list of 1,945 qualified applications. Last fall,
106 applicants were interviewed by NASA.
   The 23 astronaut candidates will train for a year beginning in
July before they are given technical jobs that lead to assignments
on shuttle missions.
   The astronaut candidates include Ronald M. Sega, the husband of
astronaut Bonnie Dunbar _ a mission specialist aboard the current
Columbia flight. Sega, a Cleveland native who is now a professor at
the University of Houston, was named a mission specialist.
   The other shuttle pilot candidates and their hometowns are:
Kenneth D. Cockrell of Austin, Texas; Air Force Capt. William G.
Gregory of Lockport, N.Y.; Air Force Maj. James D. Halsell Jr. of
Monroe, La.; Air Force Maj. Charles J. Precourt of Waltham, Mass.;
Air Force Maj. Richard A. Searfoss of Mount Clemens, Mich.; and
Marine Corps Maj. Terrence W. Wilcutt of Russellville, Ky.
   The other mission specialists and their hometowns are: Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Daniel W. Bursch of Bristol, Pa.; Leroy Chiao of Milwaukee,
Wis.; Army Maj. Michael R.U. Clifford of Norton Air Force Base,
Calif.; Bernard A. Harris Jr. of Temple, Texas; Thomas D. Jones of
Baltimore, Md.; Army Maj. William S. McArthur Jr. of Laurinburg,
N.C.; James H. Newman of Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands;
Donald A. Thomas of Cleveland; Janice E. Voss of South Bend, Ind.;
Air Force Capt. Carl E. Walz of Cleveland; Peter J.K. Wisoff of
