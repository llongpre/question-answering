   Even while Discovery is in orbit,
workers at the Kennedy Space Center are readying the next space
shuttle for launch in mid-November.
   Within hours of liftoff Thursday morning, NASA workers were
inspecting the launchpad and continuing with preparations to put
the shuttle Atlantis into orbit to deploy a secret military payload.
   ``We're ready to do another one,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone.
   Atlantis is scheduled to be launched no earlier than Nov. 17.
Since it is a Defense Department mission, information about the
payload and work that will be performed during the flight is
classified, she said.
   Unlike the Discovery flight, which has been bathed in attention
as the mission that returned America to space after a 2{-year
drought, the Atlantis flight will be very low-key, she said.
   NASA won't even make the countdown public until nine minutes
before launch. NASA makes a brief announcement when the spacecraft
reaches orbit, and every 24 hours NASA reconfirms that the flight
is continuing and the astronauts are healthy. Twelve hours' notice
is given for landing.
   Discovery is scheduled to land Monday morning at Edwards Air
Force Base in California. About 300 Kennedy Space Center engineers
and technicians will be there to prepare the spacecraft for its
flight back to Florida.
   ``We'll be out there about a week and while we're there, we're
going to be slower here at Kennedy. When we get them all back here,
our priority will be Atlantis,'' Malone said.
   About four miles from the pad, Atlantis is being prepared for
attachment to its external fuel tank, the huge orange cylinder that
feeds the shuttle's engines as it rides into space.
   The two booster rockers, which will power the shuttle off the
pad and through the first part of its trip into orbit, have already
been attached to the sides of the fuel tank.
   The shuttle could be ready to be transported to the pad Oct. 21,
Malone said.
   Atlantis will be perched on the same spot where Discovery stood,
and a damage assessment team reported little damage to the pad and
support structure from the force and heat of its sister ship's
takeoff.
   ``The condition of the pad is excellent,'' said Larry Schultz,
NASA's chief of launch structures. ``There's some normal fix-up
painting kind of thing that's got to be done.''
   Schultz said no design changes are necessary to the pad, which
has been used for only one other shuttle launch _ the tragic
Challenger flight that ended 73 seconds after liftoff in an
explosion.
   ``We've gotten pretty good'' at limiting damage to the launchpad
and maximizing its reuse, he said. ``We have 25 launches under out
belt.''
   ``There were no surprises on this one,'' he said.
   After Atlantis, Discovery is set for another mission in January,
the first of seven scheduled of 1989.
