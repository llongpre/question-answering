   The countdown began early today for a
Monday launch of space shuttle Discovery on a flight its commander
says will demonstrate ``we're a space-faring nation again.''
   The launch will be the third for the shuttle program since the
Challenger disaster more than three years ago, and the first of
seven flights scheduled this year as NASA moves toward its target of
safe, routine, once-a-month missions by 1992.
   ``The countdown started right on time,'' said NASA spokeswoman
Lisa Malone. The ambitious 1989 schedule is getting a late start,
with Discovery's flight delayed nearly four weeks so faulty or
suspect engine parts could be replaced.
   The countdown clock began ticking at 12:01 a.m. after test
conductor Jerry Crute issued the traditional call to stations that
summoned members of the launch team to their posts. The initial task
was to electrically activate the spaceship's systems.
   Charles Henschel, chief of test operations at the Kennedy Space
Center, told reporters today the early hours of the count had
progressed well and that some checks were running ahead of schedule.
   He reported gusty winds at Launch Pad 39B were delaying some
engine closeout and other work but that this should have no impact
on the countdown. He said the weather forecast for a Monday launch
was ``looking good.''
   Liftoff is set for 8:07 a.m. Monday.
   The five astronauts for the five-day mission were to arrive this
afternoon from their training base in Houston to make final flight
preparations.
   The commander, Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, said in a recent
interview that the first two post-Challenger missions, flown
successfully last September and December, ``were important to show
that we could fly the space shuttle again after the catastrophe.
   ``The next step,'' he said, ``is to prove that we can do it on a
regular basis, that we're back in the business of space, to show
we're a space-faring nation again.
   ``It was very frustrating for us in the space program the last
three years to watch the Russians set new flight time records and do
all the things in space with their shuttle while we've been
grounded,'' Coats said.
   Flying with Coats will be Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, the
pilot; Marine Cols. James F. Buchli and Robert C. Springer, and Dr.
James M. Bagian, a medical doctor.
   Bagian and Springer are to release a $100 million Tracking and
Data Relay Satellite six hours after liftoff. The satellite is to
join two identical satellites to form a global network for
transmitting communications among ground stations, the shuttle and
several other satellites.
   Once the new satellite is operational, NASA will begin closing
down six of its shuttle ground stations.
   Following deployment of the satellite, the astronauts will settle
into four days of science and medical experiments.
   The Discovery is scheduled to touch down March 18 at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.
