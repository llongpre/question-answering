   Mission scientists began counting
down today for the first flight of the space shuttle Columbia in 3{
years, to release a military reconaissance satellite and a smaller
scientific payload.
   The oldest space shuttle, last launched in 1986, has spent much
of the past few years as a ``hangar queen,'' stripped like an old
car to provide spare parts for its sister ships Discovery and
Atlantis.
   Workers began in earnest last November to put Columbia back
together, under the direction of Ann Montgomery, the first woman to
manage the processing of a shuttle for launch.
   The countdown began at 12:01 a.m. with liftoff between 7:30 a.m.
and 11:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Defense Department will not be more
specific, citing national security but not making it entirely clear
why the secrecy is needed.
   Columbia, which first flew in 1981, last was launched on Jan.
12, 1986, its seventh flight. It returned to Earth on Jan. 18, and
10 days later its sister ship Challenger exploded 73 seconds after
liftoff, killing its crew of seven and grounding the remaining
three shuttles.
   The post-accident investigation dictated more than 200 changes
on each shuttle to improve safety and performance. With a shortage
of manpower and new parts, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration decided that Discovery and Atlantis, newer than
Columbia and more easily refitted, would have priority in the
overhaul.
   For most of the time since then, Columbia languished in a
hangar, with no engines, most of its protective skin torn away, no
workers scrambling around on scaffolds.
   On Sept. 29, 1988, American astronauts returned to space aboard
Discovery. Atlantis followed in December, Discovery flew again in
March and Atlantis again in May.
   NASA several months ago set July 31 as Columbia's launch date.
Launch director Bob Sieck said he's pleased the agency is missing
it by only a few days, considering all that had to be done. ``It
will be a tremendous relief to get this one done,'' he said.
   Once in orbit, Columbia's all-military crew reportedly will
release a 10-ton reconnaissance satellite with high-resolution
cameras, along with a much smaller scientific payload.
   This will be the fourth of 30 shuttle flights dedicated fully to
the Defense Department. As on the earlier ones, the Pentagon is mum
about most details, including the length of the flight _ expected
to be about four days.
   Defense officials would like to launch these military missions
in complete secrecy, but, with thousands of people working on the
shuttle, they know that would be very difficult.
   So the Pentagon allows NASA to announce a four-hour launch
``window'' _ from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, in this case _
and to make the countdown public just nine minutes before the
planned liftoff.
