   NASA today reported an engine
problem that could ground space shuttle Atlantis beyond Thursday's
launch date even if anti-nuclear activists lose their court
challenge to stop the flight.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch began hearing arguments today
in Washington from attorneys representing NASA and three citizens
groups seeking to halt liftoff because Atlantis will be carrying a
plutonium-powered space probe.
   Shuttle test director Mike Leinbach said overnight checks found
that a controller on one of the three main engines was giving a
faulty fuel pressure reading. The device controls the engine during
the liftoff burn.
   Experts were analyzing the situation to see if the controller
had to be replaced, a task that could take five or six days.
   A decision was not expected until late in the day today or
Wednesday.
   Sources said that after the first low pressure reading, four
more tests were conducted, and the problem did not repeat itself.
   Leinbach said other countdown tasks were proceeding normally
despite four inches of rain overnight. The main job today was
loading fuel aboard the shuttle's power-producing fuel cells.
   The countdown ticked toward a liftoff at 1:29 p.m. Thursday with
the Galileo spacecraft on board.
   Opponents sought a temporary restraining order because Galileo,
which Atlantis' five astronauts are to dispatch toward Jupiter,
carries two generators fueled by 49.4 pounds of plutonium.
   They contend an explosion like that which destroyed the shuttle
Challenger in 1986 could scatter plutonium over heavily populated
east-central Florida.
   NASA responds that in tests empty plutonium containers have been
blown up, shot at and burned to determine how they would survive
all kinds of accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater
than those produced in the Challenger accident, the agency reports.
   Similar devices have been carried on 22 other U.S. spacecraft
without a problem.
   ``We're going to count down to a launch on Thursday unless we
are told to stop,'' NASA test director Ron Phelps said Monday as
the countdown started.
   About 25 people held a brief demonstration at the space center
Monday, staging a mock countdown and then collapsing in mock death
when a woman sprinkled powder representing plutonium.
   They said that if they lost in court they would attempt to stop
the liftoff by infiltrating the launch area in a non-violent
occupation.
   ``We're going to attempt to put people on the launch pad if the
court doesn't prevent the launch,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator
of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of the three
groups that filed suit.
   Reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough.
   More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140,000-acre space center
to stop any infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by
helicopters and boats.
   Only a 10-minute launch window exists on Thursday, and NASA
officials are concerned that time could easily be lost dealing with
protesters who might penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat,
plane or on foot.
   The five astronauts assigned to the mission flew to the Kennedy
Space Center Monday from their training base in Houston for final
launch preparations. They were to be briefed today on the flight
plan and progress of the countdown.
   The commander is Donald Williams. The other crew members are
pilot Mike McCulley and mission specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin
Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
