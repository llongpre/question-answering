   NASA unveiled ``5 Days To Launch''
signs at space center gates Wednesday and said space shuttle
Discovery would lift off Monday with five astronauts and a $100
million communications satellite.
   Such signs usually show up about three weeks before a launch but
were displayed much later this time because suspect or faulty
equipment delayed the launch four times past its target date of Feb.
18.
   The latest setback came Monday with the failure of a system that
commands separation of the two booster rockets and external fuel
tank from the spaceship in flight. The problem prevented a Saturday
launch.
   The faulty unit was replaced with one from space shuttle Columbia
on Tuesday and was successfully tested overnight, NASA spokeswoman
Lisa Malone reported.
   ``The Kennedy Space Center is pressing on toward a Monday
liftoff,'' she said.
   The countdown for the 28th shuttle launch, and the third since
the Challenger accident, was scheduled to start at 12:01 a.m.
Friday, with liftoff set for 8:07 a.m. Monday.
   Discovery's crew, commanded by astronaut Michael Coats, was to
arrive Friday from the astronaut training base in Houston. The
others are John Blaha, James Bagian, James Buchli and Bob Springer.
   During five days in orbit they will deploy a communications
satellite and conduct numerous medical and other scientific
experiments.
