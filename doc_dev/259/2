   The first woman to serve as NASA
commentator for the liftoff of a spaceship carrying astronauts said
Monday she was pleased with her performance _ even though she jumped
the gun in one of her reports.
   ``I said the ice team had already made their report to
management,'' Lisa Malone, 27, said in an interview. ``And I thought
that they had. This was one of those times when there was a lot
going on. It was just a few minutes later, then they came on and
gave their report.''
   Malone, who sat in the top row of the firing room a few seats
down from the launch director for Discovery's liftoff, said ``It was
just a matter of time'' before NASA used a woman as launch
commentator.
   After the launch, she was back in her office at the Kennedy Space
Center's press headquarters where she works as space shuttle
specialist. But instead of analyzing weather and engineering
reports, she was kept busy by reporters asking her to analyze her
performance.
   ``I think I did alright,'' she said, adding that it went more
smoothly than she expected ``because the launch team did such a good
job they made my job easier.''
   She said she was surprised journalists were asking her about her
pioneering role as launch commentator.
   ``I guess (it's) because they've always heard a male voice during
commentary,'' she said.
   ``There are so many woman newscasters,'' she said. ``I don't
really consider this job that much different from what they're
doing.''
   As commentator, Malone explained to the public what took place
behind the scenes as the countdown clock ticked to zero and the
shuttle rumbled skyward from its launch pad. Her job lasted longer
than she had bargained for, as bad weather delayed the liftoff by
nearly two hours.
   Malone, who was a bachelor's degree in journalism from the
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, took part in a work-study
program for three semesters at Kennedy Space Center beginning in
1982. She accepted an offer of a full-time job as public relations
specialist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
during her last semester as an intern.
   Malone edited the space center newsletter, Spaceport News, for
three years before she was assigned to the shuttle beat.
   To prepare for Monday's debut, Malone provided launch commentary
for some unmanned Atlas Centaur and Delta launches and for the early
portions of some shuttle countdowns and hired a voice coach.
