   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Ann Montgomery works in what used to be a man's
world, getting spacecraft ready for flight. Like the dozens of other
spacewomen, from project engineers to astronauts, she brings a
special attentiveness and care to the job.

   Ann Montgomery's ``baby'' stands
suspended 10 feet off the ground like a beached whale, its black
underbelly its most visible feature.
   A gang of men and women work on it night and day under Ann's
direction with all the attention a wealthy dowager would get at an
expensive spa.
   ``It's just a good old orbiter,'' she says, staring up at the
fuselage of Columbia, one of America's three space shuttles. ``I'm
kind of fond of it.''
   For the last 2{ years she has been in charge of getting it ready
for flight as the first woman ever named by NASA to be a ``flow
director'' for a manned space vehicle.
   As such, this sprightly 42-year-old engineer-manager with closely
cropped hair directs the flow of work that sweeps over the
spacecraft from the moment it arrives at the Kennedy Space Center
until it is launched. For Columbia, launch is scheduled in July. And
when it returns to Earth, Montgomery will start all over again.
   Clusters of technicians patch in the thousands of black thermal
tiles that protect its belly from blazing heat of reentry into the
atmosphere, as the spacecraft makes its long shallow dive back to
Earth.
   Others work on the landing gear, a fuel line valve. Up above in
higher scaffolds, on this day, they are removing a radiator from the
open cargo bay and making modifications to the crew cabin.
   Montgomery has about 180 technicians, men and women, working on
the vehicle, more than half assigned to the time-consuming job of
replacing tiles.
   Columbia has made seven trips into space, the last just two weeks
before Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of
seven.
   At the time of the accident, Montgomery was site manager at one
of the two orbiter processing facilities, responsible for everything
from the complex equipment and technical facilities to the
janitorial services and the vending machines.
   Six months later NASA asked her to take over as Columbia's flow
director.
   ``I had applied for the job, and I was really pleased, because it
was something I'd always wanted to do,'' she says. ``I thought, boy,
this is going to be fun.''
   It's the kind of fun that keeps her busy at least 50 hours a
week. She tries to hold it to that so she has some time for her
computer analyst husband and their children, Keith, 10, and Sally, 9.
   ``We knew the orbiters would be grounded for some time as a
result of the accident,'' she says. They expected a lot of changes.
And in fact the space agency ordered more than 200 modifications to
each of the shuttles, to enhance safety.
   In addition, Columbia, the oldest of the vehicles, was to undergo
extensive tile overhaul, and thus would be the last to return to
flight, after Discovery and Atlantis each had flown two missions.
   ``I was assigned to Columbia because I was new and it would give
me time to train,'' Montgomery says.
   She's at her office in the Launch Control Center building about
6:30 every morning to review what went on overnight, notify other
officials at the Cape and at Houston. Every day is replanned again.
   Two or three times a day she slips over to the processing
facility, a block away to check on Columbia.
   She's a veteran spacewoman, beginning as a crew systems engineer
with the Apollo moon landing program and then with the Skylab space
station project and the joint U.S.-Soviet manned flight.
   Women are no longer rare in a once male-dominated field.
   ``Things have changed too much,'' she says. ``For a long time, I
was one of the few women here, and for the first six months to two
years, (male resentment) bothered me a little bit, but after that I
tended not to notice it.''
   ``More and more women were added, and suddenly I found myself
going to meetings with other women,'' she says. ``On one of our
other orbiters, the lead project engineer is a woman. And, of
course, a lot of women are astronauts now. So you go to meetings,
and there are a lot of young women there, and you say, `Gee, we're
really good.' And it's nice.''
   One of the most rewarding moments came last September when they
powered up Columbia for the first time. ``We were working with a
very small crew at the time, and all of them really cared about what
they were doing,'' Montgomery says. ``Many people were saying, `Wow,
are you really going to do it?' It really was satisfying. It was a
milestone.''
   The most frustrating moments occur when NASA orders additional
changes, and the workload gets heavier and deadlines get tougher to
meet.
   Montgomery has worked here for NASA since 1968, just out of
college after earning a bachelor's degree in math and a master's in
industrial engineering at the University of Florida. Her husband,
Brian, whom she married soon after she began work, also is involved
in the shuttle program. They try to design the other part of their
lives around the children.
   But tough times are coming as Columbia gets closer to launch,
maybe in July. ``That will be quite a day, the end of a long road,''
she says.
