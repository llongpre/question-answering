shuttle pilot candidate; Air Force Capt. Susan J. Helms of
Charlotte, N.C.; and Army Capt. Nancy J. Sherlock of Wilmington,
Del. Helms and Sherlock were chosen as mission specialist
candidates.
   The list also includes Los Angeles native Ellen Ochoa, a

they are given technical jobs that lead to assignments on shuttle
missions.
