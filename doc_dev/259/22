   NASA launched the space shuttle for
the first time nearly 10 years ago. Thirty-six flights have
followed, with another one - the 38th - planned for December.
   As of the end of November, 120 people had flown on the shuttle,
some of them several times. Seven were killed. One of four orbiters
was destroyed.
   Here are some of the highlights of America's shuttle program:
   April 12, 1981 - Columbia blasts off on the first shuttle
flight, putting Americans back in space after six years. The
mission lasted 54 hours.
   Nov. 12, 1981 - Columbia returns to space as the first reusable
spaceship.
   Nov. 11, 1982 - Columbia carries two communications satellites
into orbit, the first time a manned spaceship has a commercial
cargo.
   June 18, 1983 - Sally Ride becomes the first American woman to
fly in space.
   Aug. 30, 1983 - Guion Bluford Jr. becomes the first black to fly
in space.
   Nov. 28, 1983 - The first non-astronauts go into space, one of
them the first foreigner launched in a U.S. spaceship. It is also
the first Spacelab mission.
   Feb. 7, 1984 - Bruce McCandless II becomes the first person to
fly free in space, without being tethered to a craft. Two hours
later, Robert Stewart becomes the second.
   April 10, 1984 - George Nelson and James van Hoften perform the
first satellite repair in orbit, replacing a failed control system
and bad electronics box on the Solar Max spacecraft.
   Nov. 8, 1984 - Discovery lifts off on the first satellite
retrieval mission. Two communications spacecraft are snared from
orbit and returned to Earth.
   April 12, 1985 - The first politician, U.S. Sen. Jake Garn,
flies in space.
   July 29, 1985 - One of Challenger's three main engines shuts
down 5 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff, forcing an
abort-to-orbit, in which a shuttle is sent into a lower orbit than
planned. It is the first in-flight engine cutoff.
   Nov. 29, 1985 - The first construction work is performed in
space. Jerry Ross and Sherwood Spring assemble and disassemble a
beam and pyramid to test techniques being developed for building a
space station. They perform a similar spacewalking demonstration
two days later.
   Jan. 28, 1986 - Challenger explodes 73 seconds into flight,
killing all seven aboard. It is America's second space tragedy. The
1967 Apollo spacecraft fire, which killed three, was the first.
   Sept. 29, 1988 - America returns to space as Discovery blasts
off with five astronauts.
   May 4, 1989 - The first planetary probe - Venus-bound Magellan -
is launched from a shuttle.
   April 25, 1990 - The Hubble Space Telescope is deployed from
Discovery. NASA calls the orbiting observatory the greatest advance
in astronomy since Galileo's telescope.
   May 29, 1990 - Columbia's countdown is halted six hours before
liftoff when hydrogen fuel leaks from the shuttle.
   June 29, 1990 - Atlantis also is found to have hydrogen leaks,
and NASA temporarily grounds the entire fleet.
   Oct. 6, 1990 - Discovery lifts off with a sun probe, ending a
5{-month grounding that is the second-longest in shuttle history.
