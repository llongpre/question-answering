   There was more at stake than pride and adventure. The 32-month
grounding of the shuttle fleet has set back the nation's
satellite-delivery system. Discovery's first order of business in
space was release of a $100 million communications satellite.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, to be released six hours
after liftoff, is a twin of a craft lost with Challenger.
   ``This has been a long 2{ years,'' shuttle chief Truly said of
the months of remorse, restructuring and rebuilding that followed
the explosion that shook America's confidence in its space effort.
   Excitement built at the Kennedy Space Center area as launch
neared. Campers and recreation vehicles found viewing places along
the Indian River. Souvenir sellers set up shop. Police handled a
series of pre-dawn traffic jams and guesstimated the crowd at a
rather modest quarter-of-a-million.
   Not since the first shuttle flight, in 1981, has there been such
interest in an American launch. During the past 32 months, 16
Soviet cosmonauts have traveled to space, leaving the United States
far behind in whatever remains of the space race.
   Hauck said in a prelaunch interview that he recognized the great
significance of his mission.
   ``We clearly cannot afford to lose another vehicle, much less
another crew,'' he said. ``I don't think the manned space program
could withstand another Challenger.''
   ``Flying into space never will be risk free,'' Hauck said.
``It's a matter of reducing the risks to a minimum and balancing
the risks that are involved with what we are trying to accomplish.''
   During the four-day orbital journey, the astronauts planned to
conduct 11 science and technology experiments and to test design
changes to the shuttle.
   Hauck said they planned a special memorial in space for
Challenger's five man, two woman crew. The nature of the memorial
would be revealed during a news conference the astronauts were to
hold in orbit on the mission's third day, he said.
   ``If we ever forget what happened to Challenger, it's going to
be a sad day, because we might become complacent once again,''
Hilmers said.
   Covey reported the flight will be less complicated than most
previous missions because NASA has elected to take a conservative
approach.
   In all, 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones have been
made to the shuttle. The program to redesign all three remaining
shuttles cost $2.4 billion.
   The effort focused on the two solid fuel booster rockets that
help thrust the shuttle into space. Flame escaped through a faulty
joint in Challenger's right booster and touched off the explosion.
   A cold temperature of 38 degrees at launch time contributed to
the accident by stiffening O-ring seals, preventing them from
sealing the joint. Some engineers had argued with lower-level
managers against launching in the cold, but their concerns were not
relayed to those making the launch decision.
   That prompted significant changes in the way NASA and contractor
managers communicate with their workers and led to creation of the
countdown oversight team headed by Robert Crippen.
   ``Under the new system,'' Crippen said, ``the lines of
communications are open to anyone, anywhere in the system.''
   Among the changes to the orbiter was the addition of an
emergency escape system featuring a blowout cabin hatch and a
12-foot aluminum and steel telescoping pole. In case of a problem
during a landing attempt while the shuttle is in stable, gliding
flight, the astronauts could slide down the pole, clearing the
wings, and parachute to safety. The system would not be of use in a
Challenger-type accident.
   Because of the escape system, the astronauts were to wear the
cumbersome pressure suits on liftoff and landing, instead of the
comfortable cotton flight suits worn on recent missions.
