   Five astronauts on Wednesday
inspected the space shuttle Discovery, which they hope to ride into
orbit late this month, and their commander reported, ``It all looks
clean; it all looks good.''
   Commander Rick Hauck and his crew drove to Launch Pad 39B for a
session that also included an examination of the communications
satellite in the spaceship's cargo bay and a walk-through of launch
pad emergency escape procedures.
   Hauck's crewmates are pilot Dick Covey and mission specialists
George Nelson, Mike Lounge and Dave Hilmers.
   They received launch preparation briefings and visited the pad
as the shuttle launch team began a countdown for a simulated
liftoff on Thursday, during which the astronauts will board
Discovery's cabin for the final two hours.
   The mock liftoff, scheduled for 10 a.m., is the last major test
before launch.
   ``After tomorrow, we're all going to be ready to fly,'' Hauck
told reporters after the pad exercises.
   Asked if he saw anything that would prevent a late September
launch of the first space shuttle mission in 32 months, he replied,
``I haven't seen anything.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is aiming for
a liftoff in the last week in September. But officials won't set a
firm date until Sept. 14, following a two-day flight readiness
review here.
   Engineers were troubleshooting one technical problem that was
not expected to affect the launch date.
   Three valves that control the flow of gaseous oxygen in
Discovery's main engines and help pressurize the fuel tank were
removed for inspection after two of them performed sluggishly
during a recent launch pad test firing of the shuttle's main
engines.
   The parts were flown to the plant of their maker, Eaton Corp. of
Valencia, Calif., where the two sluggish valves were found to be
slightly contaminated with minute particles of chrome and stainless
steel, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone. They were cleaned and are
being tested, she said.
   Three matching valves were removed from sister ship, Atlantis,
and were found to be contamination-free. Malone said engineers will
examine all six and pick the three in the best condition for
installation on Discovery.
