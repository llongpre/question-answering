   The countdown for this week's
planned launch of space shuttle Atlantis began Monday as NASA
headed for a court showdown with anti-nuclear activists seeking to
stop the flight because of its plutonium-powered payload.
   If a federal judge approves, Atlantis is to blast off at 1:29
p.m. Thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch the Galileo
spacecraft with its nuclear generators on the start of a six-year
journey to Jupiter.
   A band of 25 protesters demonstrated Monday at the Kennedy Space
Center, played out a mock death scene, and vowed that if they are
turned down by the court, they will sit on the launch pad if
necessary to halt the launch.
   Attorneys for the space agency and three citizens' groups are to
present oral arguments Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch in Washington.
   The launch opponents contend that an explosion on liftoff could
spread cancer-causing plutonium over a large area of east-central
Florida.
   NASA officials argue the two nuclear generators aboard the
Galileo spacecraft have been thoroughly tested and that flying them
poses minimal health and environmental risks. Similar devices have
flown on 22 other U.S. spacecraft without a problem.
   ``We're going to count down to a launch on Thursday unless we
are told to stop,'' NASA test director Ron Phelps said Monday as
the countdown got under way. He described Atlantis as in ``terrific
shape.''
   The astronauts assigned to the mission flew here Monday from
their training base in Houston for final flight preparations. All
five have said they are not worried about the plutonium in the
cargo bay.
   ``My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as
well as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned about
it; I feel it's safe,'' said Ellen Baker, one of the crew members.
   The others are commander Donald Williams, pilot Mike McCulley,
Franklin Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
   The protesters began their demonstration Monday with a mock
countdown that ended with a woman spreading in the air dust-like
particles representing plutonium. The participants all fell to the
ground in make-believe death.
   ``We're going to attempt to put people of the launch pad if the
court doesn't prevent the launch,'' Bruce Gagnon, one of the
protest leaders, told reporters.
   Gagnon would not disclose how the demonstraters would breach
security to reach the pad, but he said the effort, to be made
``Wednesday or Thursday, or both,'' would be non-violent. He is
coordinator for the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of
the three groups that sued.
   More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140,000-acre space center
to stop infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by
helicopters and boats.
   But there is only a 10-minute launch window available on
Thursday, and NASA is concerned the time would be consumed if
protesters penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat, plane or
on foot in the final minutes of the countdown.
