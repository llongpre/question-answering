   NASA said it will be late tonight
before engineers can pinpoint two hydrogen leaks that forced
cancellation of today's launch of Columbia and its $150 million
observatory.
   The planned 12:38 a.m. liftoff was scrubbed just six hours
before launch after sensors detected rising levels of hydrogen gas
in Columbia's engine compartment. The gas leak occurred while the
shuttle's rocket propellant tank was being loaded with liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
   NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said today that all of the
propellant must be vented from Columbia's big external tank before
workers can search for the exact point of the leaks in the maze of
plumbing in the spacecraft's aft engine compartment.
   Buckingham said that it will be late tonight or early Thursday
before NASA engineers know for certain what repairs are needed.
   Earlier, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said it will be ``at least
several days'' before another launch attempt.
   Columbia's seven astronauts were in their quarters several miles
from the launch pad Tuesday when the hydrogen leaks were
discovered. They were to have boarded the space shuttle about two
hours before launch.
   Four of the astronauts left the Kennedy Space Center this
morning to fly to their home base at the Johnson Space Center near
Houston. The other three crewmen were to follow later today.
   Although concentrated hydrogen is highly explosive, Malone said
Columbia ``was never in an unsafe position at any time.''
   NASA engineers spent hours opening and closing valves and
watching a network of sensors before finding the general area of
the leaks about midnight. One was from a 17-inch valve in a pipe
that carries fuel from the tank to the engines; the other was in
ground equipment, Malone said.
   Shuttles have three main engines that burn a propellant of
oxygen and hydrogen. The propellant, chilled to a liquid, is loaded
into the external tank about five hours before launch. The tank
actually contains two vessels, one for the oxygen and one for the
hydrogen. The two elements are combined in the rocket engines,
where they ignite and produce thrust.
   About 5 percent of the liquid hydrogen _ or nearly 20,000
gallons _ had been pumped into the external tank when the scrub was
announced, officials said. Less than 25 percent of the liquid
oxygen _ or 35,800 gallons _ had been loaded.
   Columbia is to be the first shuttle flight in five years devoted
entirely to scientific research.
   Its payload, an observatory called Astro, will study invisible
radiation streaming from distant stars and galaxies. The crew will
work an intense, around-the-clock schedule of observations during
the nine-day mission.
   The observatory includes three telescopes that detect
ultraviolet radiation given off by stars and planets, and a fourth
telescope that will detect X-rays.
   ``We humans look at the universe in visible light,'' said
Lennard Fisk, chief NASA scientist. ``But the universe is, in fact,
bright in many other kinds of radiation, and Astro will allow us to
see the universe in ultraviolet light and in X-rays.''
   The Astro instruments are in Columbia's cargo bay. They will be
operated remotely by astronauts on board the shuttle and by signals
from the ground.
   Columbia's crew includes four astronomers _ Jeffrey A. Hoffman,
Robert A. R. Parker, Samuel T. Durrance and Ronald Parise. The
commander is Vance D. Brand, the pilot Guy S. Gardner, the seventh
crewman John M. Lounge.
   The astronauts also will give science instruction to 42 middle
school students at two NASA centers. The teaching will be recorded
on videotape and distributed nationwide.
   Columbia also has on board a ham radio, and the astronauts hope
to talk to cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station Mir and to
operators of amateur radio stations around the world.
