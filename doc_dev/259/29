   A space shuttle crew made a mock
emergency landing today to conclude a major countdown rehearsal held
to test hundreds of launch changes that were made as a result of the
Challenger disaster.
   Following a successful practice countdown and liftoff, the
three-man astronaut crew, in a shuttle flight simulator in Houston,
had to make a tricky, quick return to the Kennedy Space Center
runway here when one of three main engines failed more than two
minutes into the flight.
   The rehearsal for the nation's first shuttle mission in 2{ years
put the launch team here through the final three hours of the count
in a realistic preparation for the actual launch of Discovery,
scheduled Aug. 31. It was the most comprehensive test of its kind
since Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch, killing the seven
crew members, on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The make-believe emergency landing gave the astronauts and
mission control center in Houston vital experience in making
split-second decisions. To make it safely back to the runway here,
the astronauts had to ``fly'' the simulator to an altitude of about
75 miles and about 400 miles east of here while fuel was exhausted.
   Then, with a second engine locked up and useless, the astronauts
pitched around, went through the motions of jettisoning their huge
external fuel tank into the Atlantic Ocean and, battling hydraulic
and other difficulties, glided to a mock touchdown on the
15,000-foot shuttle runway three miles from the launch pad. Landing
occurred 21 minutes after the engine failed.
   Executing the maneuvers in the simulator were astronauts Loren
Shriver, James Wetherbee and Franklin Chang-Diaz. Observing were
commander Rick Hauck and the four members of his crew who will fly
the Discovery mission in August.
   The simulated liftoff was 55 minutes late because of intentional
electrical, communications and other problems built into the count
to give controllers experience in resolving them. A high fuel
pressure reading 31 seconds before liftoff would have scrubbed a
real launch effort, but was bypassed so the test could continue.
   The exercise involved 300 launch-day team members from five NASA
field centers, contractor personnel and rescue, weather, safety and
communications officials. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the
purpose was to ``validate to the fullest extent possible the
complete launch process system.''
   There have been hundreds of changes, most aimed at safety, in
procedures, personnel, flight and ground hardware, software and
management since the Challenger accident. Today's simulation was the
only opportunity to check them out with the entire launch-day team
before the actual countdown.
   Under the new management structure, astronaut Bob Crippen,
veteran of four shuttle flights, has the final decision on whether a
shuttle will be launched. His main adviser is launch director Bob
Sieck, but either can call on scores of experts in many disciplines.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Challenger
disaster, with the major roadblock to flight being the redesign of
the solid fuel booster rocket blamed for the explosion.
   Discovery is in a hangar here, undergoing final checks following
an overhaul of its main engine and other systems. On June 16, it is
to be moved into an assembly building for mating with its two
booster rockets and external fuel tank. Transfer to the launch pad
is planned for June 27.
   The spaceship's three main engines will be test-fired on the pad
in a critical test on July 19.
   Space agency officials said the Aug. 31 launch target can be met
if no critical problems crop up during testing here and at the
Morton Thiokol plant in Utah, where two more full-scale tests are
planned of the redesigned booster rocket. The Utah tests are slated
for June 14 and July 26.
   When Discovery is launched it will carry a crew of five veteran
shuttle astronauts who will deploy a tracking and data relay
satellite and conduct experiments during four days in space.
