   The launch team was making up lost
hours Monday as a hush-hush countdown proceeded toward a
Thanksgiving Eve liftoff of space shuttle Discovery with five
astronauts and a secret spy satellite.
   Workers were several hours behind schedule when the countdown
started Sunday, but NASA reported Monday they were catching up,
doing the lagging work in parallel with other launch preparations.
   Following a three-hour launch readiness meeting Monday, shuttle
managers reported that while the schedule was tight, ``no major
issues are being worked'' and the launch remained on schedule.
   ``We're right on track for a Wednesday night launch; everything
is going fine,'' space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone reported.
   She said shuttle officials expect all tasks to be on schedule by
late Tuesday.
   Workers had fallen behind in checking out systems and
reinstalling equipment and panels on the bottom sections of the two
solid fuel booster rockets. The panels were removed earlier in the
week so technicians could inspect computer boxes suspected of
having faulty wiring. One of the boxes was replaced.
   Because the mission is classified, NASA remained silent on the
exact status of the countdown. It has said only that liftoff is
scheduled between 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. and that it will make
the count public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff.
   There also will be a news blackout throughout the mission.
   It will be only the third after-dark launch in 32 shuttle
missions. The last one, in November 1985, was visible for several
hundred miles along the east coast, from Key West at the tip of the
Florida Keys to north Georgia.
   This is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the Defense
Department. Officials said the secrecy makes it more difficult for
Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship sitting off Cape
Canaveral to track the shuttle.
   The astronauts assigned to the mission flew to Cape Canaveral on
Sunday from their training base in Houston. They slept during
daylight hours Monday to adjust their schedule to the hours they
will keep in space because of the nighttime launch.
   The commander is Air Force Col. Frederick C. Gregory, the first
black named to command a shuttle mission. The pilot is Air Force
Col. John Blaha, and the mission specialists are Navy Capt. Manley
L. Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.
   They are expected to stay in space for four days. Their main
task will be to deploy a satellite which sources close to the
project report will listen in on diplomatic and military
communications in the Soviet Union and other countries.
