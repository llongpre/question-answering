   Columbia, earthbound for 3{ years
and cannibalized for parts to keep other space shuttles flying, was
pronounced troublefree Monday and ready for a Tuesday morning
launch to put a high-powered spy satellite in orbit.
   ``Everything is on schedule, there are no constraints to
launch,'' said Lisa Malone, a NASA spokeswoman at the Kennedy Space
Center.
   The five-man crew was told that the weather appeared to be no
problem for launch. Their ship, the oldest in the fleet, has had
258 modifications to bring it up to par with the others and in the
process gained 2,500 pounds.
   Everything about the mission, except the names of the all-male,
all-military crew, was secret _ including time of liftoff, length
of mission and the cargo in the shuttle's 60-foot-long hold.
   NASA said only that the liftoff would be between 7:30 a.m. and
11:30 a.m. EDT. The most likely time was a few minutes before 8.
Military missions in the past have lasted only four days, but this
one is expected to remain aloft a day longer to test the shuttle's
control systems, unused for 3{ years.
   NASA conducted its countdown in secret. The clocks scattered
around the Kennedy Space Center were to be lit up just nine minutes
before launch. NASA will provide only minimal announcements during
the flight, including the time of landing at Edwards Air Force Base
in California.
   Sources said the astronauts will launch a 20,600-pound
satellite, capable of gathering photographic and electronic images
of the Soviet Union, China, the Middle East and other areas of
military interest.
   The satellite, traveling over much of the inhabited world, is
able to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements,
military installations and the like, according to the sources.
   The sources also said the shuttle's cargo bay holds a package of
scientific experiments for military research, built by NASA at its
Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in California.
   Columbia is the grand old man of space shuttles. It was the
first of the flying orbiters and completed five missions in 1981
and 1982 before the second ship, Challenger, joined the fleet.
Columbia flew once in 1983 and once in 1986, completing its 7th and
last mission 10 days before the Challenger explosion.
   But Columbia became outdated as the newer ships came along. And
when the fleet got its complete overhaul during the 2{-year
post-Challenger hiatus, Discovery and Atlantis got preferred
treatment. Columbia was used as a parts source until modernizing
began last November.
   ``We will have a certain sense of deja vu when Columbia lifts
off,'' said Dick Young, a NASA spokesman. ``Columbia is the first
of a kind and we're glad to see it back in flight. A lot of us
remember back in 1981 when Columbia did its first mission.''
   Columbia will return to space with two borrowed engines and one
reclaimed from an earlier flight. Engine No. 1 last was used on
Atlantis on two missions in 1985 and before that by Columbia in
1983; Nos. 2 and 3 were on Discovery last September and again in
March.
   The crew commander is Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran of
two earlier shuttle flights, including a 1983 trip on Columbia. The
other crew members are Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Navy Cmdr.
David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark
Brown.
   The mission, designated STS-28, is the fourth dedicated to
military purposes and operating under the Pentagon's strict secrecy
rules.
   Two military flights preceded the 1986 Challenger accident and
one other has been completed under a post-Challenger agreement that
called for nine flights through 1993.
   The Pentagon had planned 13 more military launches from the
shuttle in the rest of the 1990s, but has decided instead to use
expendable rockets to get the cargo into orbit.
