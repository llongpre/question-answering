<LEADPARA>  NASA delayed today's launch of space shuttle Atlantis by more than a week
because of a failed computer on one of the ship's main engines.;    The
failure occurred before dawn today, about six hours before the scheduled
liftoff, while the shuttle was being filled with more than a half-million
gallons of fuel for a nine-day mission.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Nice try," launch director Bob Sieck told his team in announcing the
delay. A new launch date was not set, but Sieck said it would be no earlier
than late next week.;    The five astronauts assigned to the
satellite-delivery mission were asleep in crew quarters when the launch was
canceled. They planned to return to Johnson Space Center in Houston this
afternoon.;    "I'm sure they're disappointed, but they want it right, too,"
said shuttle director Robert Crippen.;    Jerry Smelser, manager of the
shuttle main engine project, said the fueling was going well when one of two
communication channels on one engine controller shut down. Each of the three
main engines has a controller, which communicates with the shuttle's flight
computers and essentially serves as the engine's brains.;    The faulty
controller will be replaced with a spare, Smelser said.;    Officials said the
same problem has cropped up on shuttles before, including a 1989 case that
delayed an Atlantis flight by nearly a week.;    Launch pad workers are not
expected to get into the crowded engine compartment until Thursday, after all
the fuel has been drained from the tank. NASA plans to install the new
controller this weekend and test it early next week.;    "Should that all go
smoothly . . . we would be in a posture to pick up the count about the middle
of next week," Sieck said.;    In the past week, workers repaired a cracked
floor beam in the engine compartment, replaced two electrical components and
had trouble with a circuit. But the controller tested fine until today,
Smelser said.;    The 7:55 a.m. (PDT) launch was to have been NASA's 42nd
shuttle flight and the fifth time a shuttle had taken up a Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite.;    The astronauts had planned to release the 4,600-pound
satellite six hours after liftoff, with an attached rocket boosting it 22,300
miles above Earth. It would have joined three similar satellites already
stationed above the equator.;    NASA sent up the first such satellite in
1983. The satellite enabled Mission Control to maintain nearly continuous
contact with astronauts in space, a vast improvement over the old system of
ground tracking stations.;    The satellite network also links NASA ground
controllers with other craft, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gamma
Ray Observatory.;    When Challenger exploded in 1986, all seven astronauts
aboard were killed and a tracking satellite it was carrying was destroyed. Two
more such satellites have since been placed in orbit, the latest in 1989.;   
When Atlantis is finally launched, the satellite it deploys will replace the
second-oldest craft, which will become a spare. The oldest already is a spare.
NASA plans to send up two more by the mid-1990s.;    The four men and one
woman on board also are to conduct medical tests, ozone readings, photography
and other experiments.;    NASA plans to end the mission where it began, at
Kennedy Space Center, instead of the usual landing site, Edwards Air Force
Base in California. That will save $1 million and a week of work to bring the
shuttle back to Florida.  </TEXT>
