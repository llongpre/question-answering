   NASA crews made up for lost time
today as they worked under a tight timetable for launching space
shuttle Discovery on a fiery nighttime flight Wednesday with five
astronauts and a spy satellite.
   ``They're making headway and expect to be caught up by tonight.
We're on schedule for Wednesday night,'' space agency spokeswoman
Lisa Malone reported today.
   Forecasters said the weather outlook was 80 percent favorable
but that an advancing cold front would drop the odds to 40 percent
if the launch were postponed to Thursday, Thanksgiving.
   Workers had fallen behind in checking out systems and putting
the two solid fuel booster rockets back together. They had been
opened last week so technicians could inspect computer boxes for
faulty wiring. One box was replaced.
   Because the mission is secret, NASA has said only that liftoff
is scheduled between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. and that the agency
will make the countdown public just nine minutes before liftoff.
The launch is expected to take place about 7:30 p.m.
   There also will be a news blackout throughout the mission.
   It will be only the third after-dark launch in 32 shuttle
missions. The last one, in November 1985, was visible for the 700
miles from Key West to Charleston, S.C.
   This is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the Defense
Department. Officials said the secrecy makes it more difficult for
Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off Cape Canaveral
to track the shuttle.
   The astronauts assigned to the mission slept during daylight
hours Monday to adjust their schedule to the hours they will keep
in space because of the nighttime launch. At night, the commander,
Air Force Col. Frederick C. Gregory, and the pilot Air Force Col.
John Blaha, practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in
a jet equipped to handle like a shuttle.
   Disovery is scheduled to land at night at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., after a flight expected to last four days. Gregory
and Blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here or
at emergency runways in Spain or North Africa in case of an abort
after liftoff.
   Gregory, who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission, is the first black
to command a shuttle mission.
   The other crew members are Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F.
Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton, all mission specialists.
   Their main job will be to deploy a satellite that sources who
demanded anonymity said will listen in on diplomatic and military
communications in the Soviet Union and other countries.
