   NASA said today it will not try to
launch space shuttle Atlantis and the robot probe targeted for
Venus until a fuel pump problem and leaking fuel line are corrected
on the space shuttle and ``we don't know when we can go.''
   Sources close to the program reported earlier that the
postponement could be at least 10 days, but later said that was
based on a preliminary assessment. They said the delay will be
several days and possibly could stretch to a week or more if
technicians have to replace both the pump and the fuel line.
   NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone said NASA officials are evaluating
the problems today and have assigned committees to study each
element. She reports from those committees will be made on Sunday.
   ``We don't know when we can go,'' said Malone. ``It depends on
where the troubleshooting takes us.''
   A launch countdown was stopped Friday with just 31 seconds left
after controllers detected an electrical power surge in a main
engine fuel pump. Later, engineers found leak in a hydrogen fuel
line.
   Atlantis is to carry into space a robot probe called Magellan
which is to fly to the planet Venus in a resumption of America's
exploration of the solar system after an 11-year gap.
   Earlier, Robert Sieck, the Kennedy Space Center launch director,
said technicians would remove panels of the engine compartment to
get at the pump.
   The leaky hydrogen line, which spewed a cloud of vapor toward
the end of the countdown, also must be repaired, Sieck said.
Engineers believe the vapor escaped through a pinhole in a fitting.
   The technicians worked through the night to drain a half million
gallons of oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel from Atlantis. They then
planned to install scaffolding at the base of the spacecraft and
remove panels covering the engine compartment.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said engineers should be able to
examine the faulty pump by tonight. Only then can it be determined
how the problem will be corrected. The experts looked at the leaky
hydrogen line this morning, but were still undecided on what
repairs were needed for that problem, he said.
   If either the pump or the hydrogen line have to be replaced, the
launch could be postponed until ``well into next week,'' Sieck said.
   Atlantis couldn't be launched before Monday at the earliest
because of the two problems, he said.
   ``Both of them would have to fall into a quick fix and it would
be optimistic to expect that,'' Sieck said.
   Among tens of thousands who had gathered for the planned rare
afternoon liftoff were prominent planetary scientists who have been
waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978, when
Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last U.S. planetary expedition.
   ``We have waited a number of years for this flight, and a few
extra days won't matter,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief
scientist. ``The window is a month long. Having the shuttle ready
on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on
our way to Venus.''
   ``That's just the way it is,'' said James Head, a geologist from
Brown University.
   The space agency must send the Magellan probe on its way by May
28 to take advantage of the proper alignment between Earth and
Venus. If NASA can't meet that deadline, officials would have to
wait two years before the two planets again are in the desired
position.
   After the scrub was announced, the astronauts climbed out of the
spaceship in their bright orange launch suits and were taken back
to the crew quarters for a late lunch.
   The crew includes commander David Walker, along with pilot
Ronald J. Grabe, Mary L. Cleave, Norman E. Thagard and Mark C. Lee.
   Sieck said the preparations seemed ``picture perfect'' until 20
minutes before launch.
   A computer malfunction was quickly fixed and the count resumed
after a six-minute delay. Then, with fewer than 50 seconds left on
the clock, an engineer in the launch control room told Sieck,
``Possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump ...
recommend hold at T-minus 31.''
   The countdown was stopped.
   ``It just wasn't our day,'' Sieck said. He fretted out loud that
the weather, perfect on Friday, would likely be less ideal next
week.
   After it is released from Atlantis' cargo bay, Magellan will
rocket itself onto a 15-month, 806 million-mile path toward Venus,
the Earth's nearest planetary neighbor.
   The explorer craft will spend eight months orbiting Venus and
mapping about 90 percent of the planet surface using a
sophisticated radar system.
   Venus is a cloud-shrouded world that has always intrigued
scientists because it is about the size of Earth, but lacks any of
the conditions that make life on this planet possible.
