   Space shuttle managers Sunday
pronouced Columbia ready for flight and directed a hush-hush
countdown to continue toward a Tuesday launch with five astronauts
and a secret military satellite.
   The go-ahead followed a three-hour readiness review of all
aspects of the mission, including the orbiter, weather and the
global tracking network. NASA administrator Richard Truly sat in on
the mission management team review.
   ``There are no open items and there is nothing now that will
hold up the launch,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said after the
meeting of launch officials.
   Because the mission is classified, the space agency remained
silent on the exact status of the countdown. It has said only that
liftoff is scheduled between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   There also will be a news blackout throughout the flight on what
the astronauts are doing.
   ``The Defense Department has determined that the longer we can
keep the the launch time and the type of payload under wraps, the
less chance anyone has of tracking it and learning what it is,''
said Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman.
   Published reports and sources who requested anonymity have said
the astronauts will launch a sophisticated reconnaissance satellite
to gather intelligence data over much of the Soviet Union, China,
the Middle East and other areas of the globe of military interest.
   Warren said the only weather concern for Tuesday was the
possibility of clouds lingering in the area from overnight
thunderstorms. He said there was a 20 percent to 40 percent chance
that bad weather could interrupt launch preparations.
   The astronauts, all military officers, awakened early Sunday and
were examined by doctors. By dawn, Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw,
the mission commander, and Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, the pilot,
were flying practice landings in a jet plane outfitted with shuttle
cockpit controls.
   Later, Shaw and Richard joined their crew mates for equipment
checks and briefings on launch preparations. The other crew members
are Navy Cmdr. David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air
Force Maj. Mark Brown.
   At launch pad 39B, workers Sunday loaded propellant into the
tanks of Columbia's power-producing fuel cells, checked engine fuel
lines, inspected thermal protection tiles and removed access
platforms.
   Columbia, the oldest shuttle, will be making its eighth flight,
but its first in 3{ years. Following the 1986 Challenger explosion,
NASA concentrated first on modifying sister ships Discovery and
Atlantis, and each has made two space trips since flights resumed
last September.
   Returning Columbia to flight status will give NASA three
orbiters to handle an increasing flight rate. Three more missions
are planned this year, with nine scheduled in 1990.
   Asked Saturday if he had confidence in riding in a shuttle that
had been grounded so long, commander Shaw replied: ``Absolutely,
you bet I do. I wouldn't fly it if I didn't. ... I flew Columbia a
long time ago. It's a great machine and it will be great again.''
   Shaw piloted Columbia on a November 1983 trip.
