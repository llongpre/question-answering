   About 2,000 VIPs _ including the
officials who investigated the Challenger disaster and those
assigned to keep an eye on NASA as a result _ are expected to be on
hand Thursday to watch Discovery lift off.
   Also in the crowd at a special viewing site on the NASA Causeway
6{ miles from the launchpad will be relatives of two of the seven
astronauts who were killed when Challenger exploded 32 months ago _
Scott Smith, son of pilot Michael Smith, and Claude Onizuka,
brother of mission specialist Ellison Onizuka.
   Thousands of tourists have been converging on the area, seeking
the best views available from outside the Kennedy Space Center. In
Titusville, campers parked their RVs on the grass strip along the
Indian River and relaxed in lawn chairs. Others pitched tents or
pulled up in vans.
   Police and tourism officials said most of the hundreds of
thousands of people expected would probably arrive from midnight to
the pre-dawn hours from Miami, Tampa and Orlando, all three of them
within a few hours drive.
   NASA officials said about 3,000 special guests sought
invitations to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the first
space shuttle since Challenger exploded 32 months ago. As of
Wednesday afternoon, about two-thirds had said they would be here.
   ``We don't solicit'' VIPs to watch the launches, said NASA
spokesman Eugene Marianetti. ``They come to us.''
   Sen. John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, planned
to join about a half-dozen other senators and about 40 House
members on a flight to the space center early Thursday for a
pre-launch congressional briefing, said Martha DiSario, press
secretary for the Ohio Democrat.
   The two members of Congress who have ridden on the shuttle _
Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, and Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. _ also planned
to attend the launch, spokesmen for the lawmakers said.
   Several other former astronauts are on the list, including Saudi
Arabian Sultan Al Saud, who was a payload specialist on one of the
shuttle missions.
   Other celebrities expected to be watch the liftoff include
entertainer John Denver, actor John Travolta and actress Darryl
Hannah, NASA said.
   Denver's interest in the shuttle is as potential astronaut on a
Soviet spacecraft. The singer-actor-entertainer wants to ride
aboard the Soviet Mir space station and recently spent three days
at the Johnson Space Center undergoing a medical evaluation given
to all astronaut applicants.
   Denver was one of a number of Americans asked by the Soviets to
fly in their space program, according to a spokeswoman for Denver.
   Administration officials on the list include Lt. Gen. James
Abrahamson, whose resignation as director of the Strategic Defense
Initiative, President Reagan's space-based missile defense program
known as Star Wars, was announced this week. Abrahamson is a former
associate administrator of NASA's Office of Space Flight.
   William P. Rogers, who headed the presidential commission that
investigated the Challenger accident, and other members of that
panel, are expected. So are members of the National Research
Council, an arm of the American Academy of Sciences that NASA
appointed to oversee the shuttle redesign as a result of the Rogers
Commission recommendations.
   Dignitaries at the tragic Challenger launch viewed the liftoff
from a temporary VIP site about three miles from the pad. NASA had
begun building a permanent viewing site there when an Air Force
study raised concerns about safety so close to the launch site.
