   The space agency today postponed
launch of shuttle Atlantis on a secret military mission until at
least Saturday, as doctors treat an astronaut's cold and
forecasters worry about the weather.
   The launch had been scheduled for today until the space agency
decided Wednesday to postpone it after commander John O. Creighton
suddenly developed a sore throat and head congestion. Originally,
the launch was postponed to Friday morning; this morning, Creighton
was described as feeling better but the launch was put off at least
one more day.
   ``The commander is doing a lot better,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone. ``They're going to give him another day. And there's also
the weather.''
   NASA said the launch was delayed for at least 24 hours. That
would put liftoff in the early morning hours of Saturday, although
forecasters say the weather is unlikely to clear until Sunday.
   A statement late this morning said Creighton ``showed some
improvement overnight, but remains under assessment.''
   NASA spokesman Kyle Herring said Creighton was examined by a
NASA flight physician on Wednesday morning and was treated with
antibiotics.
   ``He does not have a fever,'' said the spokesman. ``It could be
an indication of a cold coming on.''
   Even without the astronaut's illness, the chances were uncertain
that Atlantis could have been launched today or Friday. Air Force
experts forecast a 50 percent chance today and an 80 percent chance
Friday of prohibitive clouds, rain and wind.
   Because Atlantis' cargo is a secret spy satellite, NASA has not
announced a precise launch time, saying only that a launch on
Friday would come between midnight and 4 a.m. The countdown is kept
secret until the final nine minutes before the rockets ignite, but
sources, who asked not to be named, said the liftoff will come
about 1 a.m.
   After launch, information about the mission is to be blacked out
until an hour before Atlantis returns to Earth. The mission is
expected to last four days and end with a landing at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.
   All five of Atlantis' crew members were found to be healthy
during a routine medical examination on Tuesday.
   It was only the second time a mission had been postponed because
of illness. In 1969, the Apollo 9 mission to orbit the Earth and
test the lunar landing module was delayed three days after the
three crew members got sick.
   The following year, Astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly was taken off
the crew of Apollo 13, a moon mission, when doctors learned he had
been exposed to the measles. He was replaced on the crew by back-up
pilot John Swigert, but the launch was not delayed.
   NASA officials said there were no plans to replace Creighton.
   A space shuttle launch postponement at this point in the
countdown costs the Kennedy Space Center about $247,000 in labor
and materials. This figure does not include expenses at other NASA
centers that also support the mission.
   NASA's announcement came about two hours before workers were to
start pumping more than half a million gallons of propellant into
Atlantis' fuel tank. Pumping the fuel would have added $377,000 to
the delay cost.
   According to sources who asked not to be named, Atlantis' cargo
is a 37,300-pound, $500 million spy satellite called AFP-731. It is
said to be capable of taking high-resolution reconnaissance photos
and also eavesdrop on electronic communications around the world.
   Sources said the satellite is to be placed into a high
inclination orbit that will cover more of the Earth than satellites
previously launched by the shuttle. This orbital path will carry it
over most of the Soviet Union, including areas far to the north.
   Atlantis' flight will be 34th space shuttle mission and the
sixth secret military mission.
