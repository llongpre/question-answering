   Space shuttle technicians closed up
the engine compartment today as the countdown advanced smoothly
toward Thursday's scheduled launch of Atlantis with five astronauts.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the launch team completed
certification of two replacement parts in the fuel system and other
components and reinstalled access panels on the engine compartment.
   Also under way today was a check of the shuttle communications
system.
   ``We're humming right along,'' she said.
   ``This time we're going to see if we can get it right,''
astronaut David Walker, who will command the flight, said Tuesday.
Four days earlier, a launch attempt was called off just 31 seconds
before the planned liftoff.
   ``Looks like the vehicle's been turned around real well,''
Walker told reporters. ``We're extremely pleased the folks here at
the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready
to go again.''
   The other crew members are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 1:48 p.m. Thursday.
   ``There are no major issues in sight,'' Robert Crippen, NASA's
deputy director of operations, said after a mission management
meeting Tuesday. ``We're pressing on.''
   Shuttle weather forecasters said there was a 70 percent chance
conditions would be favorable. The only concern was a threat of
crosswinds greater than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the
launch pad.
   Atlantis will carry into space the $550 million Magellan probe,
which the astronauts are to dispatch on a 15-month journey to
Venus. The probe is to orbit the planet and map its cloud-shrouded
surface with a high resolution radar system.
   The launch attempt was halted on Friday because of a short
circuit in a fuel pump.
   Technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a
suspect fuel line in half the time expected.
   Engineers thought there was a leak in the fuel line, but tests
turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the
line, thought to be gas, might have been trapped air.
   Ronald Phelps, a shuttle test director, said the new countdown,
which started Tuesday, was compressed from three days to two by
eliminating some ``hold time'' that is built into the countdown in
case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the
first attempt.
