   A small equipment room fire forced
the evacuation of about 600 workers from a building housing the
space shuttle launch control center Monday, but it was quickly
extinguished.
   NASA said the blaze would have no impact on Friday's scheduled
liftoff of Atlantis on a planetary mission.
   The fire was on the fourth floor in a room that supplies air
conditioning to part of the four-story building. The launch control
center is on the third floor.
   Space agency spokesman Dick Young said material used to insulate
equipment caught fire, but caused only ``minimal'' damage. The
workers were evacuated as a precaution and were back inside the
building within an hour. The blaze was under investigation.
   During the evacuation, he said, a skeleton crew remained in the
control center to monitor Atlantis' systems.
   On the launch pad, technicians closed the engine compartment and
checked the Magellan-Venus payload as Atlantis was readied for the
first space shuttle planetary mission.
   Space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone reported the shuttle and
its cargo were in good shape and the countdown was set to begin on
time at 8 a.m. Tuesday. Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday.
   During their four-day flight, Atlantis' five astronauts are to
release the $378 million Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay,
starting it on a 468-day outward journey to Venus.
   The 7,600-pound craft is to fire into orbit around the
cloud-shrouded planet in August 1990 and map up to 90 percent of
its surface over the next 243 days with a high resolution radar
system.
   Magellan is the first new American planetary spacecraft since
Pioneer 13 was launched in 1978, also to Venus. It also is the
first planetary payload to be carried up by a shuttle.
   Commanding the astronaut crew is veteran shuttle pilot Dave
Walker. The others are pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists Mary
Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard. They will fly here Tuesday
from their training base in Houston to make final flight
preparations.
