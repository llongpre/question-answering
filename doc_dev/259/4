   Since Alan B. Shepard made his
15-minute suborbital flight aboard the Mercury capsule Freedom 7 in
1961, counting down the final seconds to launch has been a man's job.
   On Monday, Lisa Malone changes all that.
   The 27-year-old public affairs specialist with NASA at the
Kennedy Space Center will replace Hugh Harris as the voice of
Shuttle Launch Control for the liftoff of Discovery. It will be the
first time a woman has served as launch commentator for a flight
carrying astronauts.
   Her job will be to guide the news media and the public through
the anxious minutes before the main engines ignite in a burst of
flame and smoke, until the shuttle clears the launch tower and
communications switch to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Her challenge to explain what is taking place behind the scenes
and to translate the technical chatter among launch managers into
``something that anybody can understand.''
   Malone is quick to contrast the significance of her new role with
that of female astronauts.
   ``I think what they're doing is a lot more trendsetting and
important than what a commentator does,'' she said, ``because
they're actually doing it instead of reporting on what's been done.''
   Nevertheless, Malone said, she likes to think her voice will be
an inspiration to young women.
   ``If that would inspire somebody to go on and achieve what they
want in life,'' she says, ``I think that is fantastic.''
   Malone has worked for NASA for seven years, rising to her
position of space shuttle specialist from a college work-study
program that started while she was earning a bachelor's degree in
journalism from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
   She edited the space center newsletter, Spaceport News, for three
years before she was assigned to the space shuttle beat. Now, she
attends several daily meetings of launch managers to stay up-to-date
on the progress of work to get three orbiters and their external
fuel tanks and booster rockets ready for flight.
   To prepare for her debut, Malone provided launch commentary for
some unmanned Atlas Centaur and Delta launches and for the early
portions of some shuttle countdowns. She has watched numerous
launches from her seat at the firing room console beside Harris, who
is now deputy director for public affairs at Kennedy Space Center.
   She also hired a voice coach.
   Although she has learned the lingo and has carefully prepared a
script, Malone knows her biggest challenge will be the ``real-time
element of the job'' _ and how she'll react if there's an unexpected
problem during the countdown.
   ``You're going to be scrambling to try and figure out what it is
because you want to have the right story before you tell the world
what's going on,'' Malone said.
