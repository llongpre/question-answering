   Nothing can reproduce the thrill of the
launch pad, but former astronaut Sally Ride is finding satisfaction
in the quiet of the university campus.
   Ride, America's first woman in space, joined the faculty at
University of California, San Diego, last fall. She teaches physics
and directs the California Space Institute, which coordinates space
research among the state's eight UC campuses.
   Ride said she thrives on hours spent in her research _ the
design of free electron lasers _ and in meeting with students.
   ``It's working out very well because it's giving me a way to
stay involved with the space program and use some of the expertise
and contacts that I developed while I was at NASA.''
   She added: ``I have to admit the only times I'm sorry I left
NASA are the days of shuttle launches and landings.''
   Ride, 38, who holds a doctorate in physics from Stanford
University, was a crew member aboard the 1983 space shuttle
Challenger flight.
   She served on the presidential commission that investigated the
January 1986 Challenger explosion.
   Ride resigned from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in 1987 to become a science fellow at Stanford's
Center for International Security and Arms Control.
   She remains a member of two NASA advisory committees, but admits
she gave up some of her influence on the nation's future course in
space when she left NASA.
   ``If you really want to have an impact on the space program and
its direction, you have to work within the system,'' Ride said. ``I
wanted to do physics research again and be associated with a
university.''

   A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against rock
star David Bowie that claimed he sexually assaulted a fan and told
her he had AIDS after spending the night with her.
   Wanda Lee Nichols said that Bowie assaulted her after inviting
her to his hotel room on Oct. 9, 1987, during a concert tour
stopover in Dallas.
   Bowie conceded he had spent the night with Ms. Nichols, but
denied he had assaulted her. A grand jury declined to indict Bowie
on Nov. 18, 1987.
   Ms. Nichols said she would continue to press for monetary
damages despite the decision by U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings on
Monday.
   Ms. Nichols earlier had asked that Bowie be tested for AIDS,
although her attorney said she tested negative for exposure to the
virus herself. Bowie subsequently tested negative for AIDS.
   Attorney Daniel P. Callahan, who represented Bowie, called Ms.
Nichols' action a ``nuisance suit.''

   Super Bowl MVP Joe Montana is endorsing a new
line of sports shoes and jeans that will put millions in his pocket.
   L.A. Gear Co. plans to release a signature line of men's jeans
called ``The Montana'' this fall. Montana's name also will appear
on cross-training shoes, the company announced Monday.
   Montana's contract is estimated to be worth between $3 million
and $5 million. Entertainer Michael Jackson, former Los Angeles
Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Houston Rockets center Akeem
Olajuwon also advertise for L.A. Gear.
   Montana, 33, who led the San Francisco 49ers last month to their
second straight National Football League championship, told
reporters that barring injury, he plans to play four to five more
years.
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``My football career could end
tomorrow.''

   He doesn't have a television, movie
or recording contract, but Tony Orlando keeps belting out the tunes.
   ``The show is part of my heart and soul,'' said Orlando, who is
appearing at the TropWorld Casino this weekend with his group,
Dawn. ``I always try to put in the show some kind of acting moment
where I not only sing but bring the song alive.''
   ``My first hit was in 1961, `Halfway to Paradise.' That's going
on 29 years ago and I'm still here,'' said Orlando, 45.
   Orlando's professional career began when he was 15 and Don
Kirshner hired him to sing demos in a New York City office that
represented the likes of Bobby Darin, Neil Diamond, and Phil
Spector.
   In 1972, Orlando recruited Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent to go
on the road with him as Dawn.
   The group had hits with ``Gypsy Rose,'' ``He Don't Love You,''
and ``Tie a Yellow Ribbon.'' Their TV variety show aired from 1973
to 1977.
   Hopkins has been replaced by Vincent's sister, Pam Vincent, in
the current incarnation of the group.
