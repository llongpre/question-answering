   A countdown test will be conducted today in a major rehearsal for the first space shuttle launch since the Challenger disaster. 

   The launch team will assemble in the control center for the final three hours of a simulated countdown, with a mock lift-off of the shuttle Discovery planned for 9:50 a.m. EDT. 
The exercise will be a realistic preparation for the launch, scheduled for Aug. 31. 

   Following the countdown, mission control center in Houston will assume control of a make-believe flight and will guide a shuttle crew, operating in a Houston simulator, through an abort situation in which the astronauts make an emergency landing at Kennedy Space Center. 

   The astronauts to participate are Loren Shriver, James Wetherbee and Franklin Chang-Diaz. 
Observing will be the five-man crew that will fly Discovery, commanded by astronaut Rick Hauck. 

   The launch team here has held countdown rehearsals every month for several months, but today's test will be the first to tie together the Kennedy and Johnson space centers, the mission management team and all the other elements that will be in place on launch day. 

   A National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman said the practice "will validate to the fullest extent possible the complete launch process system." 
She said it will exercise procedure and personnel changes that have occurred since the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of seven. 

   Discovery is in a hangar at Kennedy Space Center, undergoing final checks, following a major overhaul of systems. 
Many of the changes were the result of the investigation of the Challenger accident, which was blamed on a faulty joint in a solid-fuel booster rocket. 

   On June 16, Discovery is to be moved into an assembly building for mating with its two solid-fuel boosters and external fuel tank. 
Transfer to the launch pad is planned for June 27. 

   The spaceship's three main engines will be test-fired on the pad in a critical test July 19. 

   Officials said the current Aug. 31 launch target can be met if no critical problems crop up during testing here and at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah, where two more full-scale tests are planned of the redesigned booster rocket. 
The Utah tests are scheduled for next Tuesday and July 26.
