   A clandestine countdown advanced
smoothly Monday toward a fiery pre-dawn liftoff Thursday of space
shuttle Atlantis with five military astronauts and a spy satellite.
   ``You wouldn't believe how smooth it is,'' said NASA spokeswoman
Lisa Malone. ``The count picked up right on time without a hitch
Sunday night and we've had no problems.''
   Shuttle forecasters said the weather outlook was 60 percent
favorable for a launch Thursday. They said the main concern was an
advancing cold front that could bring low clouds and rain into the
area.
   Malone could not reveal the exact status of the countdown
because of the classified nature of the mission, the sixth
dedicated to the Defense Department in 34 shuttle flights.
   The count will be made public just nine minutes before the
planned liftoff on Thursday. Officials have said only that the
launch will take place between midnight and 4 a.m., but sources
close to the program report Atlantis is to take off at 1 a.m.
   Once Atlantis is in orbit, there will be a news blackout on what
is happening until an hour before the shuttle returns to Earth. The
flight is expected to last four days.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
shuttle's payload is a 37,300-pound, $500 million satellite
designed to take high-resolution reconnaissance photos and
eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications in much of the
world.
   They said the satellite will be launched into a high-inclination
orbit that will cover most of the Soviet Union, including northern
areas not previously flown over by shuttle-launched spy satellites.
The Soviets have heavy concentrations of naval ships and submarines
and several missile bases in the far north.
   The satellite, known by the code name AFP-731, and other
reconnaissance spacecraft will be important in verifying whether
the Soviets are complying with U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreements
now being forged.
   The Soviets have their own spy satellites to monitor U.S.
compliance.
   The five astronauts who will fly the Atlantis mission reviewed
their flight plan Monday and went to bed about noon. They have been
adjusting their hours to match the sleep time they will have in
space, from about noon to 8 p.m.
   The crew is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. The
others are Air Force Col. John H. Casper the pilot, and mission
specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col.
Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
