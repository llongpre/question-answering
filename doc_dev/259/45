   NASA on Sunday began replacing two
faulty fuel-system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in hope of
making another launch attempt as early as Friday.
   The launch of the shuttle and its $550 million Magellan Venus
probe was scrubbed on Friday 31 seconds before liftoff because of a
power surge on a pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen fuel for
one of the shuttle's three main engines.
   Engineers later discovered a pinhole leak in a fuel line that
carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle.
   NASA officials Sunday said they would not set a new launch date
until Monday. But they said liftoff could not occur before Friday
afternoon.
   Because of the positions of Earth and Venus, there is only a
32-day launch opportunity ``window'' for sending the Magellan
spacecraft toward Venus.
   If the shuttle can't get off the ground by May 28, the mission
will have to be put off for two years, at a cost of more than $100
million, until Earth and Venus are again in proper alignment.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said workers were removing foam
insulation from around both the pump and the hydrogen line and
hoped to have a new pump and a new line installed by Mondayy.
   After the parts have passed pressure, electrical and other
tests, NASA would be ready to restart the countdown, which lasts
two days.
   ``Right now we don't know when we will pick up the count,''
Malone said. ``But we feel comfortable with what we are doing.''
   Had the countdown continued on Friday, a computer to detect such
problems as fuel-line leaks would have stopped the engines from
firing and the five astronauts would have been safe, the space
agency said.
   Shuttle commander David Walker and pilot Ronald Grabe practiced
shuttle landings in a training aircraft Sunday and then flew to
their home base in Houston. Mission specialists Mary Cleave, Mark
Lee and Norman Thagard returned to Houston on Saturday.
   Before returning for another launch attempt, the astronauts will
keep sharp by rehearsing in a simulator.
   Six hours after launch the astronauts are to release the
Magellan from Atlantis' cargo bay, propelling it on a 450-day
journey to Venus. The 7,600-pound craft is to orbit the planet and
map up to 90 percent of its cloud-veiled surface with
high-resolution radar.
   The images relayed to Earth could tell scientists much about the
history of Venus and why it evolved so differently from Earth.
