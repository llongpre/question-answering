   The Soviet Union's new space shuttle, a
reusable craft that lands on a runway, will make its maiden voyage
at about the same time that the U.S. space shuttle is scheduled to
return to orbit for the first time since the Challenger disaster,
an industry magazine reports.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology released a report Friday
saying the Soviet shuttle will be launched in August and ``roughly
coincide'' with the return to flight of the American space shuttle.
   Launch of the U.S. space shuttle is now expected in late August,
probably on Aug. 29, according to NASA sources.
   The Soviet space shuttle, which closely resembles the American
original in exterior design, is to carry two cosmonauts into orbit
in what is expected to be a short test mission.
   Earlier reports said that the Soviet shuttle's initial test
flight would be conducted unmanned, but officials disclosed last
week that the plans call for two pilots.
   Aviation Week quoted Soviet Lt. Gen. Vladium Shatalov, chief of
the Soviet space program, as saying, ``When the Americans tested
their shuttle, two men took off. I believe that this experience is
reasonable and can be used in our country.''
   The Soviet space shuttle is launched on a liquid-fueled rocket
called the Energia. Unlike the American craft, the launch rockets
are not a part of the orbiting craft. Instead, the Soviet shuttle
includes jet engines which can be used when the craft returns to
the atmosphere. This will give the Soviet shuttle a greater range
to manuever than the U.S. shuttle, which returns from space as a
glider with no engines.
   Challenger exploded shortly after launch from the Kennedy Space
Center on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven crew members were killed. Since
then, the shuttle fleet has been grounded while National
Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers redesigned and
tested flawed equipment, including the solid-fueled rocket engines
that were blamed for the accident.
   In August, space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to be launched
from the Kennedy Space Center with a crew of five, all veteran
astronauts, and land four days later at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif.
   Aviation Week said the Soviet shuttle flight is part of an
``unprecedented'' series of space missions over the next three
months.
   ``Never before has the USSR attempted so many major new space
missions withing the same period,'' the magazine said.
   Among the Soviet flights are:
   _Two robot craft to be launched to Mars and to the Martian moon
Phobos. The craft will lift off on July 7 and July 12 for the most
complex planetary missions yet attempted by the Soviets. The craft
will include instruments provided by eight countries and the
European Space Agency. The United States is not participating.
   _On June 7, a Soyuz spacecraft with a Soviet and a Bulgarian
cosmonaut will be launched to the space station Mir for an
eight-day mission. In August, a second Soyuz will be launched with
a Soviet and an Afghan on board.
   _Last Sunday, the Soviets launched a military intelligence craft
the size of a school bus in a 530-mile circular orbit.
   Two cosmonauts aboard the space station Mir completed their
150th day in orbit last Monday. The Soviet Union has now exceeded
128,000 man-hours in space, more than triple the U.S. total of
42,463 hours.
