   Seeing the launch of the space shuttle Discovery brought tears
and relief to some relatives of astronauts killed in the Challenger
disaster, but one father avoided watching the liftoff because ``I'd
just see the other one exploding.''
   ``It was wonderful, fabulous,'' said Jane Smith, widow of
Challenger pilot Michael Smith. ``I'm so proud of how everyone did
their job to make a successful effort.''
   Seeing Discovery soar past the tragic Challenger milestone ``was
very much a relief,'' she said.
   But while watching Thursday's launch, ``I was unaware of the
tears that came to me at remembering some of the things that I
tried very hard not to remember,'' she told ABC-TV in an interview
at the Johnson Space Center.
   Challenger exploded 73 seconds after lifting off Jan. 28, 1986,
from Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. From
that same pad Thursday morning, Discovery rocketed into space to
begin a four-day, 55-minute mission.
   Bruce Jarvis, father of Challenger payload specialist Gregory
Jarvis, said he listened to the Discovery launch on the radio from
his office in Orlando, Fla., declining an invitation to watch at
Cape Canaveral because ``it would bring too many memories back.
   ``I thought about watching it, but I couldn't take it,'' Jarvis
said. ``I'd just see the other one exploding.''
   His wife, Ellen, the astronaut's stepmother, did watch from a
VIP viewing site at the space center.
   ``She sat quietly with some of our people'' as the first space
shuttle since Challenger rose from the launchpad, said Alan Helman,
founder and chairman of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation.
   It was clearly an emotional time for her, said Arnold Richman, a
spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``We just hugged and cried,'' he said.
   At her home in Kona, Hawaii, Mitsue Onizuka, mother of
Challenger mission specialist Ellison Onizuka, said she clapped and
prayed for the five-man crew as Discovery's powerful rockets fired
the shuttle into orbit.
   ``It all went so smoothly. I prayed for them,'' she said. ``I
was really happy for them.''
   The launch helped ease the pain of her son's death, she said.
   Claude Onizuka, another of her sons, traveled to the Kennedy
Space Center to watch the launch. On Monday, he sent coffee,
macadamia nuts and pineapple from Hawaii to officials at mission
control, just as his brother had before his first spaceflight in
January 1985.
   ``It was Ellison's dream to see the program progress,'' Onizuka
said last week before flying to Florida. ``If Ellison were alive,
he'd like to see it fly.''
   Onizuka and Smith's son, Scott, watched the launch with the
families of the Discovery astronauts on the roof of a NASA building
nine miles from the pad, NASA officials said. They were kept away
from reporters and NASA had no comment on their reaction.
   The other astronauts killed in the disaster were commander Dick
Scobee, Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik and teacher Christa McAuliffe.
   McAuliffe's son, Scott, a sixth-grader, and daughter, Caroline,
a third-grader, were in their Concord, N.H., school, where no
classes were allowed to watch the live TV coverage of the launch.
