   Technicians today replaced two
faulty fuel system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis, and NASA
hoped to be able to reschedule the once-aborted launch attempt for
as early as Thursday.
   Space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone said a new pump and 4-inch
fuel line were installed and were being prepared for pressure, leak
and other checks.
   ``The work is going very well,'' she said today.
   Shuttle managers scheduled a meeting this afternoon to consider
a new launch date. Earlier they had said the earliest possible
liftoff date was Friday, but with the work progressing smoothly
they said today that a Thursday afternoon liftoff was a possibility.
   Because of the shifting positions of Earth and Venus, there is
only a 32-day launch opportunity for sending the $550 million
Magellan spacecraft in Atlantis' cargo bay toward Venus.
   If the shuttle can't get off the ground by May 28, the mission
would have to be put off for two years, at a cost of $100 million,
until the two planets are again aligned properly.
   The launch was scrubbed last Friday just 31 seconds before the
planned liftoff when controllers noted a sudden power surge on a
fuel pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen propellant for one of
the three main engines.
   Engineers later discovered a tiny leak in a 4-inch-diameter fuel
line that carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the
shuttle.
   Had the countdown continued, a computer designed to detect such
problems would have stopped the engines from firing and the five
astronauts would have been safe, according to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Workers on Sunday erected scaffolding and platforms around
Atlantis, removed access panels and unhooked, insulation, wiring
and other equipment as they began removing the bad parts.
   Two of the astronauts, commander David Walker and pilot Ronald
Grabe, practiced shuttle landings in a training aircraft Sunday and
then flew to their home base in Houston. Mission specialists Mary
Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard returned to Houston on Saturday.
   At the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the astronauts will keep
sharp by rehearsing aspects of the flight in a shuttle simulator.
   Six hours after launching the astronauts are to release the
Magellan from Atlantis' cargo bay, starting it on a 450-day journey
to Venus. The 7,600-pound craft is to orbit the planet and map up
to 90 percent of its cloud-veiled surface with a high resolution
radar system.
   The images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by computer, could
tell scientists much about the history of Venus and why it evolved
so differently than its sister planet Earth.
