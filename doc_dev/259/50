   Space shuttl Atlantis
landed safely on a California desert runway Sunday, completing a
secret military mission that included the launch of a $500 million
spy satellite.
   ``Congratulations on a great flight, guys, and welcome back,''
Mission Control communicator Steve Oswald said.
   Atlantis, carrying a crew of five military men, plunged through
the Earth's atmosphere in a long fiery dive, flashed over the
California coastline north of Los Angeles and touched down at
Edwards Air Force base at 10:08 a.m. PST.
   With mission commander John O. Creighton at the controls,
Atlantis landed smoothly on a dry lakebed runway. It rolled to a
stop a minute and 15 seconds later on the center line, ending a
4{-day mission.
   Fifty-one minutes after the landing, the astronauts stepped out
of the shuttle into brilliant Mojave Desert sunshine, shook hands
with NASA officials and posed for NASA photographers. A flight
surgeon examined them briefly before they disembarked.
   ``You can probably tell by the smiles on our faces we had a
great time,'' Creighton, a Navy captain, told a crowd of 100 NASA
workers and friends, going on to refer to the many delays before
takeoff. ``It was terrific flight when we finally got off the
ground. I think we accomplished something that was important for
the country.
   ``We had a good time doing it. The space shuttle performed
superbly. And that's a tribute to all the hard work that a lot of
you out there helped put in to make the Challenger the ship that it
is and will continue to be,'' Creighton said, in an apparent
mistaken reference to the shuttle Challenger which blew up after
liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members.
   The shuttle pilot, Air Force Col. John Casper, added: ``As one
of the rookies on board, I just say, `Wow! What a fantastic
experience.'''
   Creighton, Casper and the other crew members, Air Force Col.
Richard Mullane, Marine Lt. Col. David Hilmers and Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Pierre Thuot, then boarded two jets for the flight back home to
Houston.
   They arrived Ellington Field, an Air Force base in Houston,
about 7:45 p.m. CST.
   As 40 mph winds kicked up dust, NASA crews towed Atlantis off
the unpaved dry lakebed landing strip to prepare it for a piggyback
jet ride to Kennedy Space Center, Fla., on Saturday.
   NASA spokeswoman Lise Malone said a preliminary inspection
showed about 62 of Atlantis' heat-shield tiles suffered ``dings,''
but that the count likely would change Monday.
   Atlantis returned to Earth as a weather front packing high wind
moved toward Edwards Air Force Base, threatening unacceptable
conditions for the touchdown.
   But by landing time the wind had dropped to an acceptable level
of 21 mph with gusts to 25. The temperature was 62 degrees.
   The shuttle's characteristic twin sonic booms reverberated over
the desert as the spacecraft approached. However, unlike most
previous missions, police across a wide area of Southern California
said they received no reports that the booms were heard elsewhere,
indicating that the shuttle took an unusual path toward Edwards.
   While the shuttle was descending from orbit, it experienced a
pressure dip in a hydraulic system that controls flaps and
steering. The astronauts switched to backup systems. Later, Mission
Control said pressure was restored in the primary system.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for April 12 when Discovery
is to begin a five-day mission to deploy the $1.55 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   A Pentagon-imposed blackout blocked public announcement of the
mission activities, and because of the secret nature of the
mission, the landing was closed to public spectators. A few hundred
invited guests, however, watched as the shuttle landed.
   Atlantis was launched Wednesday from Kennedy Space Center in
Florida after five delays, four caused by weather.
   NASA sources, who spoke on agreement of anonymity, said the
Atlantis astronauts deployed the spy satellite Thursday. The
satellite, sources said, is capable of taking high resolution
photographs and listening in on electronic communications all over
the world.
   Atlantis was launched on a path that carries it over points on
Earth farther north and south than any previous space shuttle. This
enabled the astronauts to place the satellite in an orbit that will
cover parts of the Soviet Union never before photographed by a
shuttle-launched spy satellite.
   A network of amateur observers, which includes posts in Canada,
Alaska and Scotland, reported Saturday they had sighted Atlantis
and a satellite in separate oribts.
   Atlantis' flight was the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth
dedicated solely to the military.
