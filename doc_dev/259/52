   The space shuttle launch team was
about 12 hours behind schedule Saturday as it worked toward
starting the countdown for the Thanksgiving Eve liftoff of shuttle
Discovery, NASA said.
   ``It's a very tight schedule, but we're still targeting the
launch for Wednesday the 22nd,'' said space agency spokeswoman Lisa
Malone, who blamed the delay on ``a bunch of little things.''
   The secret military mission, which sources said will include the
deployment of a spy satellite, is expected to last four days.
   Malone said launch officials were assessing where the lost time
could be made up before the scheduled 4 p.m. Sunday countdown
start, and ``we'll regroup tomorrow morning and see where we
stand.''
   Launch crews might be able pick up some time by speeding up the
engine closeout Sunday, she said. Some time also might be made up
by reducing the number of hours of contingency hold time included
in the countdown.
   Time was lost during the week when engineers had to replace an
electronic control box on one of Discovery's two solid fuel booster
rockets, and ``a bunch of other little things also put us behind,''
Malone said.
   She said that if officials decide Sunday that they can't make a
Wednesday launch, they could delay the liftoff until Thursday, or
put it off two days until Friday to allow most workers to spend
Thanksgiving at home.
   ``We'll look at the weather forecast for Friday and the weekend,
and if it looks good, we might reschedule for Friday,'' she said.
``But we have not ruled out a Thanksgiving liftoff.''
   Because the flight is classified, NASA and the Pentagon have
said only that the launch will occur between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30
p.m. They will not make the exact time public until just nine
minutes before the planned liftoff.
   Except for brief announcements on the shuttle reaching orbit and
on the landing time, there will be a news blackout during the
mission unless something major goes wrong.
   The flight is expected to last four days.
   Sources close to the project said Discovery's payload is an
intelligence satellite that will be able to listen in on
communications networks of the Soviet Union and other countries.
   The astronaut crew members will be commander Fred Gregory, pilot
John Blaha and mission specialists Manley Carter Jr., Story
Musgrave and Kathy Thornton.
