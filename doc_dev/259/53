   Discovery commander Frederick
Hauck, saying he wanted to end his career as an astronaut ``on a
high note,'' announced Tuesday that the first post-Challenger
flight was his last.
   ``I have decided not to go back (to space) again,'' Hauck told
reporters at the Johnson Space Center during the crew's first
post-flight press conference. ``This has been my last space
flight.''
   Hauck, 47, a Navy captain who was selected as an astronaut 10
years ago, cited his age and the number of astronauts ``waiting in
the wings'' as some of reasons for deciding not to fly again. There
are 96 active astronauts.
   He said he decided Monday to have his name taken off the flight
list, but it doesn't mean he is leaving NASA.
   Although he has not decided what he will do next, he said
possibilities include a different job at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration or returning to the Navy.
   The other Discovery astronauts _ pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists John M. Lounge, David C. Hilmers and George D.
``Pinky'' Nelson _ said they plan to remain in the astronaut corps.
   Hauck had flown on two previous shuttles before the historic
Discovery flight, including a Challenger mission that marked the
first flight in space for an American woman _ Sally Ride.
