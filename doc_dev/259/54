   The shuttle mission to propel the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit may be moved up a
day or two, but NASA said Tuesday that crews still face some bugs:
insects.
   The telescope is to be transferred into Discovery's payload bay
no earlier than Thursday, two days later than scheduled because of
gnat-like insects in a payload preparation room. NASA earlier gave
Wednesday as the earliest transfer time.
   Still, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said technicians needed
little if any of the contingency time built into Discovery's
prelaunch schedule, making it possible for the agency to take the
unusual step of moving up the launch date.
   ``The processing has gone very smoothly,'' said Dick Young, a
spokesman for the agency.
   NASA occasionally has moved around shuttle launch dates on the
manifest because of scheduling changes in the months prior to
liftoff, Young said. But it is the first time liftoff has been
accelerated once orbiter processing has begun.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Flight
Readiness Review Board will finalize the launch date after meeting
Friday and Saturday at Kennedy Space Center.
   Last month, Discovery's launch date was moved from April 18 to
April 12 after the lower right segment of the shuttle's solid-fuel
rocket booster was replaced more quickly than anticipated.
   On Monday, shuttle managers determined that problems with
Discovery's nose wheel landing gear will not hamper the mission.
   The mosquito-like midges were found on the orbiter's payload bay
doors Sunday when a servicing machine was retracted to receive the
telescope.
   By late Tuesday, 37 midges had been caught in seven traps set up
in the preparation room. Technicians plan to inspect the traps
again Tuesday night and, provided no more than a few insects are
caught, proceed Wednesday with preparations for a Thursday
installation.
   ``The Hubble is so sensitive,'' Malone said. ``They've got very
strict conditions.''
   Discovery's five astronauts are to deploy the Hubble on the
second day of the five-day mission. The telescope will orbit 370
miles above Earth, looking seven times more deeply into space and
detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best ground-based
observatory.
   The Hubble originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but was
delayed because of technical problems and the 1986 Challenger
explosion.
