   NASA on Friday named astronaut crews
for five space shuttle missions, including the first black woman
selected for space flight.
   Dr. Mae C. Jemison, 32, a physician, was assigned as a mission
specialist to a June 1991 flight aboard shuttle Discovery. The
mission is to conduct life sciences and materials processing
experiments.
   Dr. Jemison was born in Decatur, Ala., but considers Chicago,
where her parents live, to be her hometown. She received a bachelor
of science degree in chemical engineering from Stanford University
in 1977 and a doctorate in medicine degree from Cornell University
in 1981.
   She was working with CIGNA Health Plans of California and as a
general practicioner in Los Angeles when selected for the astronaut
program in 1985.
   Named to fly with Dr. Jemison were Air Force Col. Mark C. Lee
and N. Jan Davis. Other crew members will be picked later.
   Astronauts were named for flights in late 1990 and early 1991.
   Navy Capt. Richard N. Richards will command an October 1990
Atlantis mission which will dispatch the Ulysses spacecraft to
study the sun. The others are Marine Lt. Col. Robert D. Cabana,
Navy Capt. William M. Shepherd, Coast Guard Cmdr. Bruce E. Melnick
and Air Force Maj. Thomas D. Akers. Melnick is the first Coast
Guard astronaut picked for a flight.
   Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats will command the crew of Discovery
on an unclassified Defense Department mission set for November
1990. The others are Air Force Maj. L. Blaine Hammond Jr., Gregory
J. Harbaugh and Air Force Maj. Donald R. McMonagle. Previously
assigned to this mission were Air Force Col. Guion S. Bluford Jr.,
Richard J. Hieb and Charles Lacy Veach.
   Kathryn D. Sullivan and C. Michael Foale were named to a March
1991 flight aboard Columbia which is to study the sun and Earth's
atmosphere. Picked earlier for this flight were Michael L. Lampton
and Byron K. Lichtenberg. Others will be named later.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson will command Atlantis on a May 1991
flight which will deploy and then retrieve a package of science
instruments developed by the European Space Agency. Claude
Nicollier, a European Space Agency astronaut, will be a crew
member, as will NASA astronauts Jeffrey A. Hoffman and Franklin R.
Chang-Diaz, a native of Costa Rica who has made one shuttle flight
and is training for another set for launch next month.
