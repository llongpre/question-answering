   The astronauts who will operate an
observatory aboard the shuttle Columbia next month said Friday they
expect to beat the Discovery's Hubble Space Telescope in sending
back celestial clues.
   ``One of the things we've frequently reminded the space
telescope crew is that we will be sending down science data while
space telescope is still doing engineering checkout, and so we
should be able to beat them to the punch on getting down the first
science data,'' said mission specialist Robert Parker. ``We're
looking forward to being able to do that.''
   The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most valuable
payload, is scheduled to head into orbit aboard Discovery on
Tuesday. Its first launch attempt was scrubbed shortly before
liftoff April 10 when a shuttle power unit failed.
   The two-week delay has pushed the shuttle Columbia's May 9
launch date back a week or two. In addition to seven astronauts,
four of them astronomers, Columbia will be carrying a $100 million
observatory called Astro that is intended to complement Hubble's
work.
   NASA plans to roll Columbia out to the launch pad Sunday, 1.6
miles from where Discovery awaits a Tuesday liftoff. It will be
only the second time that both of Kennedy Space Center's shuttle
launch pads have been occupied at the same time.
   Columbia and Challenger occupied the launch pads in January
1986. Ten days after Columbia landed, Challenger exploded.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is waiting for
Discovery to go up before setting a new launch date for Columbia.
   ``We tease the Hubble crew that if they don't get out of the
way, we're going to go ahead of them,'' said Air Force Col. Guy
Gardner, Columbia's pilot.
   Discovery's payload bay doors were reopened Friday, and
technicians began the daylong task of installing Hubble's
batteries. NASA completed 130 hours of recharging the six
nickel-hydrogen batteries in a laboratory on Thursday.
   NASA planned to test the batteries Saturday and seal the payload
bay later in the day. The countdown for Discovery was to begin
Saturday afternoon, with the five crew members returning to Kennedy
Space Center on Sunday.
   At a news conference, Columbia's astronauts readily agreed
Friday that the much-touted Hubble is the ``crown jewel'' of NASA's
astronomical endeavors. But they said Astro's three ultraviolet
instruments and broad band X-ray telescope also will shed light on
galaxies, black holes and quasars during the nine days of the
mission.
   While Hubble will be able to discern objects in space with
extraordinary clarity and allow astronomers to look back to almost
the beginning of time, Astro will have a wider field of view and be
better able to detect ultraviolet light. Astronomers expect Astro
to uncover targets on which Hubble can focus during the telescope's
15 years in orbit.
   Columbia mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman insists ``it's not a
competition'' between Hubble and Astro or between the crews. Still,
he can't resist ribbing Discovery's astronauts every now and then.
   ``We get to be astronomers,'' he said. ``All they do is throw
out a telescope. Anybody can do that.''
