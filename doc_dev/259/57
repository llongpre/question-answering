   America's space shuttle fleet has been
grounded until engineers can correct a hydrogen leak that has been
found on a second spacecraft, officials said today.
   William Lenoir, NASA's space flight chief, said that the agency
has no choice but to stop space shuttle launches and allow
engineers to study the leak problem and fix it.
   ``We can't fly until we can get hydrogen in the tank and we're
having a problem with that right now,'' said Lenoir at a news
conference from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The announcement came after engineers conducted a leak check on
space shuttle Atlantis, which is on the launch pad awaiting a
planned mid-July launch.
   The test, involving pumping up to 200,000 gallons of liquid
hydrogen into Atlantis' giant external tank, was intended ``to
establish confidence in the hardware,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone said.
   Malone said a concentration of hydrogen was found near a
four-inch disconnect valve in the area of a 17-inch-diameter valve,
the same that appeared responsible for the leak that grounded
Columbia.
   The leak was detected by one of two sensors mounted between the
orbiter and the tank about 18 minutes after the test began. An
additional 21 sensors had been installed in the orbiter's aft
compartment to sniff for leaks.
   Before the leak was discovered, NASA had hoped to launch
Atlantis on a secret military mission in mid-July.
   The leak check was ordered as a precaution after a similar
hydrogen leak stopped the countdown for the shuttle Columbia six
hours before its intended launch May 30. Columbia is now grounded
until at least mid-August.
   The leak was spotted moments after the slow filling of the tank
was switched to fast pumping, at precisely the point in the tanking
where Columbia's leak was discovered.
   NASA officials, including launch director Bob Sieck and Kennedy
Space Center Director Forrest McCartney were monitoring the test
from the firing room.
   The tank, only about 5 percent full at the time the leak was
sensed, was to be filled further in an effort to isolate the leak,
Malone said.
