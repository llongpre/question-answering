holiday honoring the civil rights leader.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Jan. 16, 1978, NASA named 35 candidates to fly on the space

four people fated to die in the Challenger disaster: Francis R.
Scobee, Judith A. Resnik, Ronald E. McNair and Ellison S. Onizuka.

political turmoil and violence, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi departed
Iran for Egypt, leaving behind a civilian government in control; he
would never return.
   Five years ago: In a generally conciliatory speech, President
Reagan declared ``1984 is a year of opportunities'' for peace, and
he called on the Soviet Union to revive nuclear arms talks.
   One year ago: Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder was fired as a CBS

blacks to a Washington TV station, including the assertion that,
during the era of slavery, blacks had been bred to produce stronger
offspring.

singer Marilyn Horne is 55. Auto racer A.J. Foyt is 54. Country
