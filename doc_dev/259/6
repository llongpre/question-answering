   Sally Ride, America's first woman in space, will leave the space agency in August for a fellowship with a California arms control think tank, officials said. 

   Ms. Ride, who celebrated her 36th birthday Tuesday, is a veteran of two shuttle flights and now is finishing a major NASA study on the agency's long-term goals in space. 

   NASA Administrator James Fletcher called her career "one of the most varied and productive in agency history." 

   Ms. Ride will remain with the agency until Aug. 15; she then will work as a science fellow at the independent Stanford University Center for International Security and Arms Control in Palo Alto, Calif. 
Ms. Ride holds a doctorate in physics from Stanford. 

   Ms. Ride, who once said that "being an astronaut was never a lifelong dream," served as a member of the Rogers Commission that investigated the January 1986 Challenger disaster. 
She had been assigned to fly in orbit a third time, aboard Challenger last July. 
She is married to an astronaut, Steven Hawley. 

   "Her flight as the first American woman in space firmly established an equal role for women in the space exploration program," Mr. Fletcher said. 
"Today, the assignment of women to shuttle crews is a routine matter based on ability and need and is no longer a cause for notice." 

   She became the third woman in space after blasting off aboard Challenger June 18, 1983.
