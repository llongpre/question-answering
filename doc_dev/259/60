A small amount of cocaine was found here in a hangar where space shuttles are 
readied for launch, NASA officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Space agency spokesman Karl Kristofferson said the drug was found early Friday 
in an orbiter processing facility, one of two at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time cocaine has been found at the Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, marijuana plants were discovered growing in isolated areas of the 
Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge where the space center is located, but the case 
did not involve NASA personnel. 
</P>
<P>
NASA spokesman Hugh Harris said the cocaine was found under a desk that is used 
by more than one person. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very small amount," Harris said. "Security doesn't want to talk about 
any details until they do more of their investigation." 
</P>
<P>
NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone told the Florida Today newspaper Saturday that the 
drug seizure "is considered an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
Malone said she did not know how much cocaine was involved. Officials said they 
did not yet know who owned the drug, and no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is led by security officers from NASA, Lockheed Space 
Operations Co. and EG&amp;G Florida Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is responsible for overall shuttle processing at the Kennedy Space 
Center under a multibillion-dollar contract, while EG&amp;G is responsible for 
base operations, including security. 
</P>
<P>
Malone initially said the cocaine was discovered by drug-sniffing dogs during a 
routine sweep, but Harris said no dogs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The security people don't want to say how it was found," Harris said.
