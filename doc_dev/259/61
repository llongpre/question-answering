On Sunday, July 20, 1969, US astronaut Neil Armstrong, commander of the
spacecraft Apollo 11, became the first man to set foot on the moon. As he
took his momentous first step he said: 'That's one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind.'
But 25 years later, the dizzy excitement of space exploration fuelled by the
race in space between the US and Russia has been replaced by the more
mundane worries of an industry fighting like many others for continued
public and government support to help fund its future development and
challenges.
Space has become a commercial enterprise, albeit a high-risk one, and many
of its remarkable technological achievements are now taken for granted by a
population more concerned about jobs and welfare than by new scientific
discoveries and the prospect of human beings living and working in space one
day.
'I find it rather sad to see around here a relatively small crowd of people.
When I've been here in the past it was jam-packed,' said a senior executive
of the Anglo-French Matra Marconi Space group. He was speaking moments
before the launch in July at Cape Kennedy in Florida of the US shuttle
Columbia carrying an international space laboratory inside its cargo bay.
The launch was spectacular and successful. The shuttle was blasted into
orbit in a great cloud of smoke for a 14-day mission when its seven crew,
including Japan's first woman astronaut, conducted life science and other
scientific microgravity experiments inside the Dollars 1bn laboratory.
But it made little impact in the news. In the US, the big stories were the
trial of a famous American football star, floods in Georgia, unemployment
figures and the death of the North Korean leader. If the American newspapers
relegated the mission to the inside pages of their newspapers, it was lucky
to find even the briefest of mentions in the European press. Only the
Japanese covered the story in full, reflecting the presence on board the
shuttle of the first Japanese woman in space and the determination of Japan
to build up a strong presence in the space sector.
In Japan, the government space budget is continuing to rise while it is
declining elsewhere. The latest victim of budgetary reappraisals in Europe
is the Hermes project to build a European manned space vehicle. In the US,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is having to fight
for funds every year and many of its space projects, especially the Dollars
30bn space station due to be completed by 2002 and involving broad
international collaboration, are living on a budgetary knife-edge.
With the emphasis now being placed increasingly on the commercial
opportunities offered by space, governments, space agencies and
manufacturers of space equipment have been concentrating on the satellite
business, in particular for earth observation, meteorology and
communications. Governments have also continued to show growing interest in
satellites for military applications. The role played by satellites in the
Gulf war has further boosted this interest.
In turn, competition in the satellite and satellite launch business has
intensified. The commercial battle has essentially pitted the US against
Europe. In the commercial satellite launch business, Europe has managed to
build a leading position during the past 14 years with Arianespace and its
Ariane rockets.
The French-led Ariane programme has done for the European space industry
what the Airbus consortium has achieved in the civil aircraft field: the
establishment of a credible competitor to the US dominance of commercial
aerospace markets that lasted until the early 1980s. But although Ariane has
now taken a share of more than 50 per cent of the commercial satellite
launch market, it is facing tough competition not only from US launchers but
also from Russia, China and Japan, all seeking to penetrate the western
market.
With a finite market of around 20 commercial satellite launches a year, the
battle for market share has provoked increasing international trade tensions
mirroring those in the commercial aircraft market between the US and Europe.
The US have accused the Europeans of subsidising its rocket launcher
industry, while the Europeans have accused the Americans of
cross-subsidising commercial launch operations with their large military
satellite market, which to all intents remains closed to international
competitors. And both the US and Europe have campaigned against price
dumping for satellite launches by the Russians and the Chinese and sought to
negotiate trade agreements with these countries.
Competition has been equally fierce in the satellite manufacturing side of
the business. It has forced leading manufacturers to seek wider partnerships
and has led to increasing consolidation in the industry. In Europe, two big
transnational groups are being established to create the economies of scale
necessary to compete in a tight market.
The French Matra group has already merged its satellite activities with
those of the UK General Electric Company into a joint venture called
Matra-Marconi Space, which is 51 per cent held by the French concern.
Matra-Marconi Space is now acquiring the space systems division of British
Aerospace in a deal which would create a European space group with annual
sales of more than Dollars 1bn. At the same time, Deutsche Aerospace, the
aerospace arm of the Daimler-Benz car group, is negotiating to merge its
space operations with those of Aerospatiale, the French state-controlled
aerospace company.
But if the prospects for the satellite business remain secure, even though
it is likely to face increasingly competitive pressures, the future of
manned space flights continues to be clouded with uncertainty. NASA
officials concede that the fate of the US space shuttle will hinge on
whether the US-led programme to build an international space station will
survive or suffer from government budgetary cuts.
The Dollars 30bn project is designed to create a permanent orbiting science
institute in space capable of performing long-term research in materials and
life sciences in a gravity-free environment. NASA says that this fundamental
research will accelerate breakthroughs in technology and engineering that
will have practical applications on earth.
'What governments must decide is whether you should continue supporting
long-term fundamental scientific research and space exploration or simply go
for short-term commercial pay backs,' said one senior US space industry
official.
The issue is now taking on, once again, an international political
dimension. But in contrast to the race between the US and Russia 25 years
ago when the two superpowers were competing to outmanoeuvre each other to
take the leadership in space, they are now working increasingly together.
NASA recently signed a Dollars 400m contract with the Russian space agency
to support a joint programme involving the US space shuttle and the Russian
Mir space station. The contract also covers co-operation in the planned
international space station.
This collaboration, which both sides see as consolidating the new post Cold
War era, could prove to be the main driving force to keep alive the
long-term ambitions of the international space industry.
