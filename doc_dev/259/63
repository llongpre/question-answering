   William P. Rogers, the head of the
commission that investigated the tragic Challenger explosion, said
today's successful launch of the shuttle Discovery was ``a
wonderful day'' for the space program.
   Rogers and about 2,000 VIPs watching the launch from a special
site about 6{ miles away from the pad hooted and cheered as the
shuttle soared through blue sky until it could no longer be seen.
   ``In my days, the sky was the limit. It's not the limit any
more,'' Rogers said after the launch.
   Two relatives of Challenger astronauts also watched the liftoff
at Kennedy Space Center from a different location than most of the
other VIPs, said NASA spokesman Arnold Richman, though he was not
sure where.
   Scott Smith, son of pilot Michael Smith, and Claude Onizuka,
brother of mission specialist Ellison Onizuka, were on hand to
watch the first shuttle mission since their relatives were killed
along with five other Challenger astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
   At the VIP site, at least one celebrity joined former astronauts
and members of Congress watching the launch from bleachers.
   Actor John Travolta told reporters before the launch he was a
guest of former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, whom he had met in a movie.
   Asked if he would like to go into space someday, Travolta, a jet
pilot for eight years, said, ``I'd love to.''
   NASA set up one VIP viewing area 6{ miles from the launch pad to
accommodate about 2,000 invitees and one nearby to seat about 2,000
more.
   Special guests of NASA had watched the Challenger liftoff from
the same seaside pad from only three miles away, but for safety
reasons the space agency limited the number of people allowed that
close for today's launch.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said about 3,000 special guests sought invitations to the launch,
and by Wednesday afternoon, about two-thirds had said they would be
there. NASA spokesman Eugene Marianetti said the agency does not
solicit VIPs to watch the launches.
   ``They come to us,'' he said. ``We get a lot of criticism when
celebrities do come ... but the fact is that most of the people
watching (from VIP areas) will be average American people.''
   Sen. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, and Sen.
Jake Garn, R-Utah, who flew aboard Discovery in April 1985, watched
the launch from the main media site about 4 miles from the pad.
   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the only other member of Congress who
has flown in space, also was at the space center for the liftoff
and was flying back to Washington shortly after.
   Several other former astronauts were on the guest list,
including Saudi Arabian Sultan Al Saud, who was a payload
specialist on one of the shuttle missions.
   Others who had been expected to attend, including entertainer
John Denver, never arrived.
   Denver, who wants to ride aboard the Soviet Mir space station,
recently spent three days at the Johnson Space Center undergoing a
medical evaluation given to all astronaut applicants. He was one of
several Americans asked by the Soviets to fly in their space
program, according to a spokeswoman for Denver.
   Other VIPs watching included Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, whose
resignation as director of the Strategic Defense Initiative,
President Reagan's space-based missile defense program known as
Star Wars, was announced Tuesday. Abrahamson is a former associate
administrator of NASA's Office of Space Flight.
   William P. Rogers, who headed the presidential commission that
investigated the Challenger explosion, and other members of that
panel, were expected. So were members of the National Research
Council, an arm of the American Academy of Sciences that NASA
appointed to oversee the shuttle redesign as a result of the Rogers
Commission recommendations.
