   Atlantis' astronauts, silent to the
world because of their military mission, put in a final day of work
in orbit Friday on their hush-hush assignments before preparing for
a Sunday landing.
   NASA said Atlantis is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, and a spokesman said this means the five-member,
all-military crew probably will spend most of Saturday packing up
for the return to Earth.
   No information was released about the crew's activites in orbit,
but Jeff Carr, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center, said that
if the Atlantis crew follows shuttle mission routine, then Friday
was the final full day to complete the secret objectives.
   Typically, the day before landing ``is a day to clean up and
start cabin stowage,'' Carr said. He said astronauts usually must
spend their pre-return day in orbit dismantling and putting away
equipment used during the mission.
   Carr said the astronauts on Saturday also must test fire the
reaction control jets and check other critical systems that
Atlantis will need during its fiery plunge through Earth's
atmosphere.
   Workers, meanwhile, started inspections of the solid rocket
boosters that were used to put Atlantis in orbit. The spent
boosters were recovered from the sea, where they fell after the
launch and towed to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The
boosters will be disassembled and refurbished for later use.
   NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone said a general inspection of the
rockets didn't reveal any abnormalities, but noted, ``we really
won't know until they're taken apart.''
   It was a failed solid rocket booster that caused the 1986
Challenger accident that killed seven astronauts.
   The silence from Atlantis on Friday was good news, said NASA
spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   As long as there is no announcement from Mission Control, said
Buckingham, ``we can safely assume there are no problems.''
   A Pentagon-imposed blackout on mission details is to be broken
sometime Saturday for an official NASA announcement of the precise
landing time. This announcement usually comes 24 hours before
landing.
   Sources at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said the astronauts accomplished the major objective of their
mission Thursday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
astronauts successfully cast into orbit a $500 million spy
satellite that will take detailed pictures of the Soviet Union,
including areas not seen by previous shuttle-launch satellites. The
spy craft also is able to tune into electronic communications all
over the world, the sources said.
   Atlantis' mission began early Wednesday with a spectacular
launch in darkness from the Kennedy Space Center. The liftoff came
on the sixth attempt. Five earlier countdowns were halted due to
weather, the illness of an astronaut and a failed computer.
   The mission is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. Others
in the crew are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and
mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Atlantis' flight is 34th shuttle mission and the sixth dedicated
solely to the military.
