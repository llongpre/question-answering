   Discovery will be moved to the
launch pad in a formal ceremony on the Fourth of July to be readied
for the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight, NASA said today.
   The five-member astronaut crew slated to fly on the next mission
will be on hand when the shuttle is rolled out on a huge tracked
transporter under the glare of spotlights at 12:01 a.m. Monday, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
   The 4.2-mile trip to Launch Pad 39B is expected to take six to
seven hours.
   Earlier this week the space agency announced it had officially
delayed Discovery's liftoff from late August until early September,
saying it was taking longer than planned to prepare the vehicle for
the first shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28,
1986.
   NASA's working date for liftoff is Sept. 4.
   During the ceremony Forrest S. McCartney, director of the
Kennedy Space Center, will present the astronauts with an autograph
book to carry on their four-day mission that contains the
signatures of the 15,240 workers here who have labored to return
the shuttle fleet to space.
