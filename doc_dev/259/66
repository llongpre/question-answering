   Space shuttle Atlantis, aloft at
last on a secret military mission after five launch delays, orbited
the globe Wednesday in a public silence that NASA officials said
meant all was well.
   Atlantis blasted off with five military astronauts and a cargo
believed to be a $500 million spy satellite at 2:51 a.m., its
700-foot column of fire visible for hundreds of miles. It was
NASA's sixth attempt at launching the 100-ton spaceship for the
mission, one short a record for the most shuttle postponements.
   ``Thank goodness we can finally stop meeting like this,'' NASA
administrator Richard Truly told the launch team after Atlantis
rocketed into orbit. ``It was a tough one to get off, but a great
job.''
   Nothing was heard from Atlantis' all-military crew, and launch
director Bob Sieck said, ``the crew was pretty quiet and very
patient.''
   ``The fact that we haven't heard anything indicates that all is
going according to plan,'' added Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Because of the classified nature of the Defense Department
mission, NASA quickly blacked out public release of communications
from the shuttle for the entire trip.
   Liftoff, originally set for Feb. 15, almost was delayed a sixth
time because of bad weather at Kennedy Space Center and at
emergency abort sites.
   The first scheduled liftoff was halted when the crew's commander
was stricken with a cold. His illness, combined with uncertain
weather, prompted NASA to scrub the second launch.
   The others were blocked twice by bad weather and once by a
malfunctioning computer.
   With rain and clouds threatening to postpone once more, NASA
halted Wednesday's countdown for about two hours. The clock was
restarted at nine minutes, paused briefly for a final weather
check, then ticked to liftoff.
   ``The weather finally cooperated. We had a good, smooth count,''
said Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center. ``The
team exercised good patience.''
   As the rocket ignited, light burst from the launch pad and
leaped form cloud to cloud across the nighttime horizon.
   People as far north as Washington, D.C., reported seeing the
blue, white and red light of Atlantis' rockets as the spaceship
streaked up the East Coast on the highest inclination orbit ever
traveled by a shuttle. For many, it resembled a brilliant falling
star.
   ``It only lasted about seven to 10 seconds. But it beat the hell
out of a fireworks show,'' said Mike Albertson, an editor at the
Savannah (Ga.) Evening Press who watched from Tybee Island, Ga.
   Atlantis' 62-degree inclination puts it over far northern parts
of the Soviet Union never before observed by a shuttle-launched
satellite. The spy satellite on board is capable of taking
high-resolution photographs and listening in on electronic
communications from around the world, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The mission is expected to last 4{ days and end with a landing
at Edwards Air Force Base in Calif., sources said.
   Atlantis' crew is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. The
others are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and mission
specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col.
Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
