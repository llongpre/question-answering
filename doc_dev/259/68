   Space shuttle Atlantis, due to lift
off Thursday on a secret military mission, faces a 70 percent
chance of delay due to threatening high winds, clouds and
thunderstorms, NASA said Tuesday.
   Despite the dismal forecast, NASA officials said the countdown
that began Sunday was continuing smoothly.
   ``Everything's still going smoothly ... no hitches whatsoever,''
said space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone. ``Weather is the only
issue right now.''
   Forecasters said a front that moved through Monday night had
stalled south of Cape Canaveral and was expected to shift back to
the north on Wednesday night. On Monday, the weather forecast had
been 60 percent favorable but dropped overnight as the weather
system advanced.
   A low cloud cover prevented the astronauts from taking part
early Tuesday morning in routine practice flights aboard a shuttle
training aircraft. Instead, the five men reviewed flight data and
prepared for a possible practice flight Wednesday, NASA spokesman
Kyle Herring said.
   The astronauts were in bed by early afternoon, adjusting their
hours to match the sleep time they will have in space, from about
noon to 8 p.m.
   Because of the secrecy surrounding the mission, NASA was not
providing precise countdown information and would say only that
liftoff will occur between midnight and 4 a.m. Thursday. It will
make the count public nine minutes before the planned blastoff.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Atlantis will
lift off at 1 a.m.
   Atlantis is the sixth flight in 34 missions dedicated solely to
a national security payload. Officials say the secrecy makes it
harder for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off Cape
Canaveral to track the shuttle and learn its mission.
   The sources said the astronauts are to deploy a 37,300-pound
satellite to snap high-resolution reconnaissance photos and to
listen in on military and diplomatic communications around the
world.
   They said the shuttle will be launched into an orbit that will
fly over most of the Soviet Union.
   The satellite, known by the code name AFP-731, and other
reconniassance spacecraft will help verify whether the Soviets are
complying with U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreements being forged. The
Soviets have their own spy satellites to monitor U.S. compliance.
   Navy Capt. John O. Creighton is commanding the crew. The other
astronauts are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and
mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
