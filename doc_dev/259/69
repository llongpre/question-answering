   Discovery moved into the glare of
spotlights early Monday on its long-awaited trip to the launch pad
and a giant step toward America's first space shuttle flight since
the Challenger tragedy.
   A flag-waving Fourth of July crowd of several hundred space
workers cheered as the 85-ton spaceship edged out of an assembly
building at 12:50 a.m., riding upright on the broad back of a giant
tracked transporter called a crawler.
   The 4.2-mile journey to Launch Pad 39B was scheduled to take six
to seven hours. Attached to Discovery were a 154-foot-tall external
fuel tank and the two 149-foot solid fuel booster rockets that will
hurl the craft into space on a flight scheduled for early September.
   As the rollout began, Kennedy Space Center director Forrest S.
McCartney presented astronaut Dave Hilmers, one of Discovery's five
assigned crew members, with an autograph book containing the names
of 15,240 engineers, technicians, managers, secretaries, clerical
workers and other center employees who have labored to return the
shuttle fleet to flight.
   The astronauts will carry the book into orbit with them.
   McCartney, Hilmers and other NASA officials watched the rollout
from a flag-bedecked grandstand outside the assembly building.
   The early morning move was planned to avoid thunderstorms and
lighting which are common during the day this time of the year.
   Center officials originally said all five of Discovery's
astronauts and NASA administrator James C. Fletcher would be here
for the rollout. But four of the crew members elected to spend the
holiday weekend with their families in Houston, and Fletcher's
office said Friday he couldn't make it.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after it lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986. All
seven crew members perished in the massive explosion.
   Since then the booster has been significantly redesigned and
tested and hundreds of other modifications have been made to the
shuttle main engines and other systems.
   Once at the pad, Discovery will be readied for a critical July
24 test of modifications to the three main liquid-fuel engines.
With the spaceship bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the power
plant will be ignited for 19.4 seconds at the end of a practice
countdown.
   The following day, one final pre-flight test-firing of a
redesigned booster rocket is planned at the Morton Thiokol plant in
Utah. Both tests must be passed before Discovery is certified for
flight.
   On Sunday, a test of an intentionally damaged version of the
shuttle rocket's redesigned joint was apparently successful, Morton
Thiokol said. The test was conducted at a plant near Brigham City,
Utah.
   ``It appears no gas leaked outside the joint, in spite of the
very severe intentional flaws,'' said Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
``That has really raised our confidence for the (full-scale) test
at the end of the month.''
   The 1 p.m. MDT test was performed on a simulator that uses three
shortened rocket cases, two joints and 385 pounds of propellant to
mimic pressures present during when a full-scale rocket motor is
fired.
   Last week, NASA announced that it had changed the liftoff date
from late August to early September because it was taking longer
than expected to prepare Discovery for flight.
   Hilmers and four other veteran shuttle pilots will be at the
controls when Discovery blasts off to mark what NASA is counting on
to revive America's manned space program. The others are Commander
Rick Hauck, Dick Covey, Mike Lounge and George Nelson.
   During their four-day mission, the astronauts will deploy a
communications satellite, conduct scientific and technical
experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter systems.
