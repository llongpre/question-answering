   A new astronaut on track to
becoming NASA's first female shuttle commander said she welcomes
the Bush administration's scrutiny of the beleaguered agency.
   The administration on Monday ordered a review by outside experts
of the nation's long-term space goals, the same day the astronaut
candidate class of 1990 reported to work for the first time.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has endured a
spate of recent embarrassments, including trouble with the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope and hydrogen leaks that have
grounded the space shuttle fleet.
   Air Force Maj. Eileen Collins, one of 23 new astronauts selected
earlier this year, told reporters she is not unnerved by problems
with sophisticated machines. The new astronauts were chosen from
more than 2,000 applicants.
   ``There are high points and low points in any airplane or weapon
system,'' Ms. Collins said Monday. ``You learn to get through the
bad times.''
   ``If our president feels it's something that needs to be done,
it needs to be done,'' she said.
   If all goes according to plan, Ms. Collins would become the
first woman to command a shuttle mission. She said she hopes to be
flying shuttle missions to help construct the planned space station
Freedom.
   The candidates will become full-fledged astronauts a year from
now, after undergoing advanced training and evaluation. In the
history of the program, only one candidate has dropped out during
this last leg, officials said.
   An assignment on a space shuttle would probably take at least
two years after that.
   Besides the seven pilots, the 1990 class includes 16 mission
specialists. Eleven of the 23 are civilians and 12 are military
pilots.
   Of the five women selected, three are military officers,
including Ms. Collins. The class also includes Ellen Ochoa, of Los
Altos, Calif., the first Hispanic woman to be selected.
