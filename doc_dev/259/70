   Engineers today sought the source of
a small gas leak in a space shuttle steering engine, a new problem
NASA officials said could further delay the first shuttle flight
since the Challenger explosion.
   Experts were probing deep into Discovery's left Orbital
Maneuvering System engine pod in an effort to locate the leak. But
the leak was so tiny it was difficult to isolate, and the process
could take several days, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   Launch pad workers detected an odor of nitrogen tetroxide gas
Friday while preparing Discovery for its planned early September
launch, she said. It was in a pod covering one of the two engines
used to maneuver the shuttle in orbit.
   Nitrogen tetroxide serves as an oxidizer in the engines,
providing oxygen to ignite the fuel when the shuttle is in
oxygen-poor space.
   Officials could not say whether the leak would further delay the
launch, already postponed several times since NASA set a liftoff
date for last February, Malone said.
   ``It will depend on where the leak is and how severe it is,''
Malone said.
   Officials said they believed the leak was in one of three
places: a power valve, an oxidizer tank filter or a jet thruster.
   If the leak is too inaccessible to be repaired on the pad,
Malone said Discovery might have to be returned to an assembly
building, a move officials estimated could delay the launch by
several weeks.
   When initially detected, the leak rate was 15 parts per million,
considered very minor, Malone said. The rate later dropped to 3 or
4 ppm, she said.
   Discovery is being readied for the first space shuttle flight
since the Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts 2{
years ago.
   Elsewhere, engineers at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah
continue to inspect a solid fuel booster rocket damaged last week
when a joint was mistakenly overpressurized.
   A ground test-firing of the rocket has been delayed from late
July until at least mid-August while experts consider what repairs
have to be made.
   The test, the fifth full-scale firing of the redesigned rocket,
is considered essential before Discovery can be committed to
flight. A faulty booster rocket joint triggered the Challenger
explosion.
