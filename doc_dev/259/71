   A ruptured hose spilled five gallons
of hydraulic fluid inside shuttle Atlantis and caused a brief drop
in pressure just before landing, but the astronauts were never in
danger, NASA says.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said Wednesday the damaged hose
will be analyzed to determine what caused the problem.
   Atlantis was returning on Sunday from a secret military mission
to deploy a spy satellite when Mission Control announced an
indicator light was on, warning of a pressure drop in the hydraulic
system that controls flaps and steering.
   A few minutes after the 9:40 a.m. PST announcement, NASA
reported pressure had been restored. The shuttle landed smoothly at
10:08 p.m. Neither of Atlantis' two backup hydraulic systems was
used, the space agency said.
   ``We don't think it was any threat at all based on the
information we had at the descent,'' NASA spokesman Bruce
Buckingham said.
   Because of a Pentagon-imposed blackout surrounding the 4{-day
mission, the hose may have ruptured before the problem became
public, Malone said. The blackout was lifted 1{ hours before
touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``It wasn't announced until re-entry,'' she said. ``It could
have happened on the mission or on the way up.''
   A thin coating of hydraulic fluid was found throughout the aft
engine compartment, Malone said. Engineers discovered a 1-inch
split in a 3-foot-long high-pressure hose for one of the shuttle's
three auxiliary power units.
   Technicians on Wednesday removed the rubber-coated stainless
steel hose and sent it for analysis to Rockwell International in
Downey, Calif., Malone said. The company builds the orbiters but
contracts out work involving the hoses.
   If the problem had existed and been detected before liftoff,
NASA would have delayed the mission until the hose was repaired or
replaced, Malone said.
   Malone said she was not aware of a hydraulic line rupturing
during any previous mission.
   Removal of the hose will not affect the shuttle's piggyback jet
ride from Edwards back to Kennedy Space Center, Malone said.
   A modified Boeing 747 is scheduled to transport Atlantis on
Saturday. The trip, including stopovers for refueling, is expected
to take about nine hours.
