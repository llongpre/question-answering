<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Associated Press; HOMECOMING -- The crew of the space shuttle
Atlantis, led by pilot Michael Baker, comes home to a red carpet welcome.  </CAPTION>
<LEADPARA>  After nearly nine days in orbit, the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth
on Sunday without mishap, and the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,
Fla., returned to service as a regular landing site for shuttle missions.;   
"Well done, Atlantis," mission control told the crew of four men and one
woman, commanded by Col. John Blaha of the Air Force, seconds after the craft
touched down at 8:23 EDT (5:23 PDT) Sunday morning. "Congratulations on a
picture-perfect mission."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Atlantis lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on Aug. 2 after a series of
technical problems and postponements. It carried out 22 scientific experiments
and launched a giant communications satellite intended to help channel the
flow of information from low-orbiting spacecraft back to Earth. Sunday's
landing was the first NASA scheduled at the Kennedy Space Center since 1986,
although two shuttle flights have been diverted to Florida in the last year
because of bad weather at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California.  </TEXT>
