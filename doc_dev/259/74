   Gusty wind delayed some work, but the
countdown progressed on time Friday toward a Monday launch of the
first of seven space shuttle missions planned this year.
   While winds up to 30 mph were pesky, NASA test director Frank
Merlino said they were abating and that the weather forecast was
``looking good'' for launch day for space shuttle Discovery and its
crew of five.
   The countdown began at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Several hours later,
Merlino reported that most systems checks were running on or ahead
of schedule. The winds delayed the sealing of the engine compartment
and removal of some work platforms, but he said that would not
interrupt the countdown.
   Liftoff is scheduled at 8:07 a.m. EST Monday for the 28th space
shuttle flight and the third since the Challenger explosion killed
seven astronauts more than three years ago.
   Discovery returned Americans to space last September, while
shuttle Atlantis flew in December.
   Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, the astronaut who will command next
week's flight, said it will kick off an ``ambitious year'' as NASA
moves toward its goal of safe, routine once-a-month launches by 1992.
   Coats and his four crew members flew here Friday afternoon from
their training base in House to make final preparations for launch.
   Talking with commanders on arriving, Coats noted his crew had
been assigned to a flight four years ago, one that was to have been
launched in 1986, only to have the Challenger accident interrupt
plans.
   ``We've had a lot of ups and downs and a lot of frustrations over
those years,'' he said. ``But this crew has held up incredibly well.
... We're certainly ready to go.''
   The others are Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, the pilot; and three
mission specialists, Marine Cols. James F. Buchli and Robert C.
Springer and Dr. James M. Bagian, a physician.
   During five days in orbit, they are to release a $100 million
Tracking and Data Relay communications satellite and conduct
numerous medical and scientific experiments.
   In a recent interview, Coats said the first two post-Challenger
missions ``were important to show that we could fly the space
shuttle again after the catastrophe.''
   ``The next step,'' he said, ``is to prove that we can do it on a
regular basis, that we're back in the business of space, to show
we're a space-faring nation again.''
