   Discovery's astronauts donned orange
pressure suits and threw switches in a successful practice
countdown Thursday, and NASA officials said they hope to launch the
first space shuttle since the Challenger tragedy this month.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to
announce a launch date Wednesday, following a two-day flight
readiness review here. Officials have been discussing a date from
Sept. 26 to 29.
   ``We clearly demonstrated that we're ready to pick up the count
for real; I hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the
month,'' Kennedy Space Center Director Forrest S. McCartney told
the launch team after the test.
   ``It certainly sets the stage for what we're about ready to do
here in just a few weeks,'' launch director Bob Sieck added.
   ``You have a feeling this train is about to leave the station
and we're about to get on board,'' said astronaut Mike Lounge.
   ``The enthusiasm around here is obvious,'' McCartney said. ``It
seems to me like we've finally got it put back together.''
   He referred to the long recovery, with its many setbacks and
milestones, from the Challenger explosion that killed seven
astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Thursday's practice countdown was the last of those major
milestones, and it was completed with only a few minor
communications glitches.
   It began Wednesday, and the five-man Discovery crew boarded the
shuttle Thursday to participate in the final two hours, throwing
switches, testing communications and monitoring systems, just as
they will on launch day.
   The commander is Navy Capt. Rick Hauck. The pilot is Air Force
Lt. Col. Dick Covey, and the mission specialists are George Nelson,
Lounge and Marine Maj. David Hilmers. All have flown on shuttle
missions.
   For the test, they wore bright orange pressure suits, the first
time a crew has not worn comfortable flight coveralls since the
fifth shuttle mission in 1982.
   The pressure garments, which all shuttle crews will wear on
launch and re-entry, would be needed in case of trouble during an
emergency landing attempt and the astronauts had to bail out by
blowing an explosive hatch, sliding down a telescoping pole to
avoid hitting the wing, and parachuting to Earth.
   This emergency escape system has been added since the Challenger
explosion. It would not help in a Challenger-type accident, in
which the shuttle blew up 73 seconds after liftoff.
   The communications problems, in ground equipment, delayed some
practice countdown activities and the test ended 34 minutes late. A
computer stopped the count at six seconds before a mock liftoff,
just as it would if there were an engine problem on an actual
launch, giving the launch team experience in handling such a
situation.
   The test concluded three days of training here for Discovery's
crew. Afterward they returned to their base at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
   Hauck and Lounge will be back here next week to represent the
crew at the flight readiness review which will determine a launch
date.
   Hauck said the meeting, on Tuesday and Wednesday, ``is an
in-depth review that all elements of the program will have a
requirement to sign on the dotted line to say that their part of
the program is ready for us to fly.''
