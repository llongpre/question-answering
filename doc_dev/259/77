The National Aeronautics and Space Administration counted down toward a fifth 
attempt to launch the space shuttle Atlantis early this morning, as clouds and 
high, gusting winds threatened to delay the launch a fifth time. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be nip and tuck," said Air Force Capt. Tom Strange, the shuttle 
weather officer. "We have to hope for a letup, but at this point we don't see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
As the planned launch time of 12:55 a.m. EST approached, launch director Bob 
Sieck called for an extended hold. 
</P>
<P>
Winds over Kennedy Space Center reached 33 m.p.h. in the opening hour of the 
planned launch period, which began at midnight Sunday and was to extend through 
4 a.m. Unless the winds calmed as the launch period wore on, the shuttle could 
be grounded for the fifth time. NASA rules do not permit a launch unless wind 
conditions safely permit the shuttle to lift off its pad and to return and land 
at the space center if such an emergency measure were to become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth attempt to launch the craft came after an astronaut's cold, then foul 
weather, and finally a last-minute computer failure delayed the launch of the 
space shuttle four separate times. 
</P>
<P>
Working throughout Sunday morning and afternoon, NASA engineers fixed the 
"Cyber B," a back-up computer designed to ensure the safety of areas beneath 
the flight path. Sunday morning's delay cost taxpayers $547,000 in labor and 
material expenses at Kennedy Space Center alone, since the shuttle was forced 
to jettison 500,000 gallons of fuel at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
The three earlier delays, which were called hours before countdowns were to 
have begun, cost $247,000 in added services. 
</P>

The flight of Atlantis, the 34th flight of a U.S. space shuttle and the sixth 
shuttle flight entirely dedicated to a Defense Department mission, has a crew 
of five military astronauts. John O. Creighton, a Navy captain, is commanding 
the flight. Creighton's scratchy throat and congestion prompted NASA to call 
off two earlier launch attempts. The other astronauts aboard Atlantis are Air 
Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. 
David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre 
J. Thuot. 
</P>
<P>
While the Defense Department has shrouded Atlantis' payload in secrecy, experts 
said that the shuttle is being used to carry a $500-million satellite called 
the KH-12 into space. The "keyhole" satellite would be the sixth in a 
constellation of U.S. craft designed to photograph and relay images of military 
and other installations, according to John Pike, a space expert with the 
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.
