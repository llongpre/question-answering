   Discovery thundered into orbit today
with five astronauts and a nuclear-powered sun probe, ending the
shuttle fleet's second-longest grounding ever and boosting NASA's
battered credibility.
   The 100-ton spaceship rode a 700-foot-pillar of flame at 7:47
a.m. EDT through a thin bank of clouds and then into a sky flushed
by a rising sun.
   The liftoff was 12 minutes late because of showers near a
shuttle emergency landing runway at the Kennedy Space Center and a
momentary technical glitch.
   Discovery began NASA's 36th shuttle flight and the first in 5{
months. The probe tucked inside its cargo bay was to be sent on a
1.86 billion-mile journey to study the sun's unexplored poles.
   Two minutes into the flight, the two solid fuel rockets burned
out and dropped into the Atlantic Ocean. Discovery continued upward
on the thrust of its three main liquid fuel engines, reaching a
184-mile-high orbit 6{ minutes later.
   ``It was just a fantastic sight to see this thing go,'' said Ed
Massey, a project administrator for NASA. ``We think it's
fantastic, and it's also a great plus to the nation that the
shuttle fleet is up and flying again.''
   ``After 18 years, you can't help but feel good,'' said scientist
Edgar Page, who started working on the project in 1972 for the
European Space Agency.
   NASA had been counting on a successful flight to help boost its
image, battered this year by a string of failed launch attempts,
the Hubble Space Telescope's flawed mirror and this week's accident
involving another shuttle, Atlantis.
   Workers forgot to remove a 9-foot-long beam from Atlantis, and
the metal piece banged around the orbiter as it was being lifted
into an upright position.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said he did not know whether to
describe the team's mood today as ``one of euphoria or relief.''
   Sieck said the team was confident heading into liftoff ``in
spite of the distractions and the disappointments that have
occurred recently, which would tend to overshadow a lot of good
work that's been put in to get ready for this mission.''
   ``The team worked real hard for this, Sieck said. ``They earned
it. They got their reward - finally.''
   The major hurdle to launch - fueling - went smoothly. No
dangerous leaks were detected as more than 500,000 gallons of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen gushed into the shuttle's
external tank earlier today.
   NASA's two other space shuttles, Columbia and Atlantis, sprouted
hydrogen leaks during fueling and had to be returned to the hangar
for repairs. Discovery was the last shuttle to fly, in April, and
is the only craft in which hydrogen leaks were not found.
   The longest shuttle-fleet grounding was 2{ years, after
Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff in January 1986, killing
all seven crew members. Discovery also was the first shuttle to fly
after that hiatus, launching a successful mission in September
1988.
   The latest Discovery mission isn't being affected by a shutdown
of government agencies because of the dispute over the federal
budget. Kennedy Space Center spokesman Dick Young said funds for
the mission already had been set aside.
   A federal judge in Washington also sided with NASA on Friday in
denying a request by environmentalists to delay the mission for
safety reasons.
   The solar probe Ulysses contains nearly 23.7 pounds of
radioactive plutonium-238. It will provide electricity for the
807-pound satellite during its five-year, $750 million mission to
study the sun's poles.
   Ulysses would be the first spacecraft to orbit over the sun's
polar regions. All previous craft circled over the equator.
   NASA's chief scientist, Lennard Fisk, said he expects Ulysses to
``revolutionize our knowledge of the sun and the region of space
that surrounds it.'' The European Space Agency satellite has been
waiting to be carried aloft since 1983.
   About six hours after liftoff, Discovery's crew, commanded by
veteran astronaut Dick Richards, was to send the spacecraft
hurtling toward the planet Jupiter at a speed of 34,450 mph, making
it the fastest man-made object in relation to Earth.
   The crew was given the go-ahead two hours into the flight to
begin reparing for Ulysses' deployment.
   While swinging around Jupiter, Ulysses will receive a gravity
assist that will slingshot it toward the sun. The satellite is
expected to pass over the sun's south pole in 1994 and the north
pole in 1995.
   The rest of the four-day mission involves experiments, including
one in which a fire would be started in a sealed chamber in an
effort to improve safety on future flights.
   In addition to Richards, the crew consists of pilot Robert
Cabana and mission specialists William Shepherd, Bruce Melnick and
Thomas Akers.
