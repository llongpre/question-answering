   The crew for the first space shuttle
planetary mission completed a successful practice countdown Friday
while launch pad workers prepared for final checks of the
spacecraft's engines and cargo.
   Shuttle technicians planned to spend the weekend hooking up
turbopumps in Atlantis' three main engines.
   ``We should be all buttoned up and ready to check the engines
for flight by Monday,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   NASA wants Atlantis to lift off on April 28 but concedes the
schedule is tight. Shuttle managers are to meet April 14 to set a
firm launch date.
   A test of the computer and communications link between NASA's
ground control station and the shuttle's $378 million cargo, the
Magellan Venus probe and its booster rocket, was scheduled for
Saturday.
   After a 466-day trip, Magellan will orbit Venus with a
high-powered radar pointed at the planet's surface. Over 243 days,
the radar is to send back the sharpest images yet of Earth's
nearest solar system neighbor.
   The five astronauts assigned to the 29th shuttle flight spent
the final two hours of the dress rehearsal inside the craft's cabin
and wearing bulky space suits.
   The countdown test, which began Thursday, duplicated much of the
actual count. The main differences were that the fuel tank wasn't
loaded, some procedures were shortened and technical problems were
built in to give launch controllers a workout.
   ``Everything appears to have gone as planned,'' said NASA
spokesman Hugh Harris. ``The exercise is designed to allow the
launch team, the crew and the payload team to take a look at
exactly what's going to happen on launch day.''
