   Space shuttle Atlantis is carrying
two space newcomers, part of a new generation of astronauts with a
look and background unlike that of the all-white, crew-cut, All
American team who rode the Mercury capsules.
   Nine more rookies have been named to four future flights, and a
new class of astronauts is in training to fill spots vacated by
veterans who took other jobs after the shuttle Challenger exploded
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The space program now has 93 men and women astronauts, with a
nearly even mix of experienced space travelers and those who have
never flown into space.
   Within 10 years, NASA is expected to add more as it responds to
the demand of more shuttle flights and begins construction of the
space station.
   America's new astronauts are far different from the seven
original ones.
   The first U.S. astronauts were all military test pilots, all male
and all white. All Jack Armstrongs in flight suits.
   The space shuttles, with room for up to seven crew members,
opened new opportunities.
   In 1978, NASA selected women and men, pilots and non-pilots, and
black, white, Hispanic and Asian candidates.
   The newest group, chosen last year, includes the first black
woman astronaut, Dr. Mae C. Jemison, a physician, and the first
Coast Guardsman, Bruce E. Melnick.
   Another group is scheduled to be chosen in January 1990. Despite
the loss of the seven Challenger astronauts, the number of
applications has increased since the accident, Johnson Space Center
spokesman Jeff Carr said.
   The competition seems to have stiffened over the years, said Lori
Garver, executive director of the National Space Society, a
Washington-based space advocacy group of about 20,000 people from
the general public.
   ``I don't know how it could get more competitve from the early
days, but it seems to have done just that,'' Ms. Garver said. ``They
have experience in all kinds of areas. (NASA) looks at the whole
person and what they have to offer.''
   The astroanuts are also more aggressive about voicing their
opinions about quality and safety since Challenger, said astronaut
Charles Bolden Jr., a Marine colonel. ``Now, people have no qualms
about speaking out,'' he said.
   When Challenger exploded there were 95 astronauts. More than a
dozen later retired. Some returned to their military branches;
others _ like Sally Ride, the first American woman in space _ left
NASA to pursue other careers.
   Fifteen people _ 10 military and five civilians _ were added to
the astronaut ranks in August 1987. Two of them are women, Ms.
Jemison and Jan Davis.
   It takes at least four years of training before an astronaut can
even be assigned to a flight, and crews generally are named a year
before their launch date, Ms. Davis said.
   ``I didn't understand before I came here how all-encompassing the
job is. We don't just flip switches and follow check lists. We've
got to understand what's going on with all these systems,'' said Ms.
Davis, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering.
   Vance Brand, a civilian pilot who flew on two shuttle flights and
the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission, said there has been an evolution of
sorts in the astronaut corps, with a greater diversity of skills and
backgrounds.
   Hee said he expects even more diversity in the future.
   ``Space is like the American West, the Arctic or Antarctica. It's
a new locality where you can do all kinds of different things,''
Brand said.
