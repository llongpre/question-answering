   A booster rocket that was to be tested in two
weeks in Utah was damaged when a workman incorrectly installed a
test gauge, but NASA said today that the accident is not expected
to delay the resumption of space shuttle flights.
   The space shuttle Discovery is poised on its launching pad at
Cape Canaveral, Fla., for liftoff on Sept. 4. The successful
outcome of the booster rocket test in Utah is a requirement for the
launching to take place.
   NASA spokesman David Garrett said the test motor will have to be
disassembled as far as the center field joint for evaluation and
possible repairs, and then be reassembled.
   That, he said, will reuire rescheduling of the test from July 25
to ``at least mid-August.'' But, he added, ``We do not expect it
will affect the STS 26 launch schedule. ''
   STS-26 is the official designation for the first flight of a
space shuttle since a 1968 explosion destroyed Challenger and
killed seven crew members.
   Edward S. Campion, a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokesman, said a Morton Thiokol worker damaged the
test rocket over the weekend while attempting to install a gauge
that was to be used during a test firing.
   ``It (the gauge) was installed with an incorrect setting which
caused the hardware to be damaged,'' said Campion.
   Ed Medal, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., said the rocket's center field joint was
inadvertantly overpressurized during leak checks.
   He said one section of the joint was subjected to pressure of
1,000 pounds per square inch. Another section, he said, was to have
been checked at 100 psi, but was mistakenly subjected to the higher
pressure.
   The rocket engine was to be test fired in Utah on July 25.
Campion said NASA officials have said that that test must be
successfully completed before the space shuttle can fly again.
Space shuttle Discovery is now on a launch pad at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida and is scheduled to be launched early in
September.
   Campion said officials are trying to determine how long the test
firing in Utah will be delayed by the needed repairs and if this
delay will affect the space shuttle launch.
   The test rocket in Utah incorporates a new booster design
created after the January 1986 Challenger accident, which killed
seven astronauts. Space shuttle Challenger exploded after its
launch from the Kennedy Space Center. The explosion was blamed on a
flawed rocket booster design. The space shuttle fleet has been
grounded while the booster had been redesigned and tested.
   NASA officials said the July 25 test was crucial for clearing
the shuttle for the resumption of space flights.
