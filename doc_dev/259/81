   The signs today read ``7 Days to
Launch'' as NASA prepares for Discovery to lift off with five
astronauts on a flight the space agency hopes will restore
credibility to America's manned space program.
   The signs, at entrances to the Kennedy Space Center, greet the
13,000 workers here who have labored 32 months since the Challenger
tragedy to return the shuttle to flight.
   Next Thursday, barring any problems, Discovery will be fuming on
the launch pad, its flight crew ready to go.
   Spirits are high among shuttle workers. They began soaring after
a successful launch pad test-firing of Discovery's engines Aug. 10
and an almost flawless countdown practice Sept. 8, the last two
hurdles before launch.
   ``We clearly demonstrated we are ready to pick up the count for
real,'' the space center director, Forrest S. McCartney, told
cheering workers after the countdown test.
   But one possible threat to Discovery's launch was revealed
Wednesday, when NASA officials said an old-model nozzle inlet ring
was used in the final test of Morton Thiokol's redesigned space
shuttle booster rocket.
   However, NASA doesn't believe the finding will delay next week's
launch, spokesman Ed Medal said.
   Medal said it had not yet been determined conclusively if
outdated rings were used in the two boosters attached to Discovery,
but a preliminary investigation showed they had not.
   Kennedy Space Center has adopted the slogan ``America's Pride
... The Journey Continues'' for Discovery's mission. It is
proclaimed on a banner at the launch pad entrance, in offices and
on thousands of pins worn by employees ranging from engineers to
secretaries.
   At the launch pad today, technicians were set to purge
Discovery's fuel cells and external fuel tank with gases to remove
possible contaminants, install batteries in the communications
satellite in the cargo bay, and complete other last-minute
preparations for the start of the countdown at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   At Johnson Space Center in Houston, Discovery's crew was
scheduled to discuss the mission in late afternoon during a visit
with President Reagan. Afterwards, Reagan was to address center
workers on the space program.
   Once the countdown is under way, the astronauts will fly here
Monday afternoon to make final preparations for flight.
   Commanding the crew is Navy Capt. Frederick Hauck. The pilot is
Air Force Col. Richard O. Covey and the mission specialists are
Marine Lt. Col. David Hilmers, George D. Nelson and John M. Lounge.
All are veteran shuttle fliers.
   During four days in orbit they are scheduled to deploy a
communications satellite, conduct 11 science and technology
experiments and check out more than 200 modifications made to the
vehicle.
   Most of the changes are intended to make the shuttle safer and
were instituted after the Challenger explosion that killed seven
crew members on Jan. 28, 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded
since the accident.
