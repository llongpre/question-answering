<LEADPARA>  It will probably go down in UFO lore as the "flying bumper," but the object
that snuggled up to the space shuttle over the weekend wasn't a first for NASA
-- U.S. spacecraft have had mysterious companions before.;    During nearly 30
years of space flight with human crews, sightings ranging from ice crystals to
an astronaut's spare glove have become part of the lore of spaceflight. John
Glenn logged the first mystery in 1962 when he spotted what he called
"fireflies" accompanying his Friendship 7 flight. Just ice, experts later
decided.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Later that same year, on the edge of space, Robert Michael White said he
saw a large sheet of paper tumbling along beside his X-15 space plane -- at 59
miles above the Earth and at four times the speed of sound. That, too, was
ice, officials would later decide.;    The space bumper, a slightly curved
4-foot-long by half-inch-thick strip in the shape of a car bumper, was sighted
by astronauts Saturday. It had been spotted on earlier shuttle missions, too.
"We know it is at least the third time they have seen something nearly
identical to this," said James Hartsfield, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.; 
  Astronauts videotaped similar objects in 1988 and 1989 when shuttle crews
launched rocket-propelled satellites using equipment and methods similar to
Friday's deployment of a communications satellite.;    NASA officials are
comparing tapes of earlier sightings to Saturday's apparition. One theory is
that the object is something that floated out of the cargo bay.;    Karl
Kristofferson, a NASA spokesman at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,
Fla., speculated that it might have been a sliver of ice that broke free from
one of Atlantis' engine housings.;    "I doubt that it was anything left in
the cargo bay by NASA workers here at Cape Canaveral," Kristofferson said.;   
The shuttle was in what space agency officials call a clean orbit because
there was relatively little space debris in the area. Thousands of pieces of
space junk, ranging from spent rockets to loose screws, orbit the Earth.
Military radar keeps track of the larger pieces.;    Saturday's visitor
floated slowly away. "We don't know what it was. But we're sure it was ours,"
Hartsfield said. "We definitely want to look inside the cargo bay when the
shuttle gets back."  </TEXT>
