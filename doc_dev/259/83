   Navy Capt. Daniel C. Brandenstein,
chief of the astronaut corps and a veteran shuttle astronaut, is
commander of the shuttle Columbia on its mission to capture an
experiment-laden satellite.
   It is Brandenstein's responsibility to guide the shuttle to
within 35 feet of the satellite, which has been in orbit for nearly
six years, so a robot arm can be extended to latch onto the
spacecraft and pull it in the cargo bay for the trip back to Earth.
   ``It will be like hunting a speck in the sky,'' he said in an
interview. ``But NASA has had plenty experience doing this type of
rendezvous, and Jim (Wetherbee, the pilot) and I have practiced it
to perfection in the simulator.''
   Brandenstein, 46, selected as an astronaut in 1978, was the
pilot of his first trip to space, an August 1983 mission that
launched and landed at night. He commanded his second flight, which
launched in June 1985.
   After his second trip to space, Brandenstein was deputy director
of flight crew operations before being named chief of the astronaut
office at the Johnson Space Center.
   Brandenstein born in Watertown, Wis., earned a bachelor's degree
in mathematics and physics from the University of Wisconsin.
   He joined the Navy in 1965 and became a pilot. He participated
in two combat deployments aboard the USS Constellation and USS
Ranger to Southeast Asia and flew 192 combat missions.
   Brandenstein and his wife, Jane, have a 17-year-old daughter
named Adelle.

   Columbia mission specialist Bonnie
Dunbar has been practicing for years the complicated task of
grabbing a satellite in space and putting it in the space shuttle's
cargo bay.
   Mrs. Dunbar, who has flown on one previous shuttle flight, will
use the shuttle's 50-foot robot to capture the science satellite
that is in danger of falling back to Earth.
   Once she grasps it, she will hold it and turn it frequently for
as long as five hours so other crew members can photograph each of
the exterior experiments to document their condition in case they
don't all withstand the trip back to Earth.
   Mrs. Dunbar, 40, has simulated the satellite retrieval at least
100 times.
   ``I feel comfortable with it,'' she said in an interview. ``I'm
really anxious to see how it really responds on orbit.''
   Born in Sunnyside, Wash., she earned a bachelor's and master's
degree in ceramic engineering from the University of Washington.
She later earned a doctorate in biomedical engineering from the
University of Houston.
   She became a payload officer-flight controller at the Johnson
Space Center in 1978. She became an astronaut in 1981, and was a
mission specialist on a shuttle Spacelab mission in 1985.
   Mrs. Dunbar also is a private pilot and an adjunct assistant
professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Houston.
   Her husband of 1{ years, Ronald Sega, is an electrical
engineering professor at the University of Colorado who is on
sabbatical at the University of Houston.

   Mission specialist Marsha Ivins,
one of three space rookies assigned to the Colombia shuttle flight,
says it is impossible to emotionally prepare for the first trip
into space.
   ``You can't prepare for something you haven't seen or done,''
said Ms. Ivins, 38, an astronaut since 1984.
   But she and the other four Colombia crew members have undergone
intensive training for the mission, simulating the various
objectives of the flight and learning about the experiments on
board.
   Some of her responsibilities include photographing the satellite
that is to be retrieved before it is stowed in the shuttle's cargo
bay. She also will photograph other aspects of the mission as well
as keep track of several experiments.
   Ms. Ivins was born in Baltimore, Md., and received a bachelor's
degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado in
1973.
   She first flew a plane when she was 15 and now holds licenses
for several types of single-engine planes and even has a glider
commercial license.
   She came to the Johnson Space Center in July 1974 and worked
here for 10 years as an engineer before being selected as an
astronaut.

   Mission specialist G. David Low's
desire to become an astronaut developed at a young age while he
watched his father work on the nation's developing space program.
   His father, the late George M. Low, worked with NASA since its
inception in 1958. His positions included chief of manned
spaceflight, manager of the Apollo spacecraft program, deputy
director of the Johnson Space Center, and deputy administrator for
NASA in Washington D.C.
   The elder Low always let his children stay home from school on
the days of NASA's liftoffs and splashdowns, Low said.
   Low said he decided wanted to fly in space when he saw the first
live television from orbit.
   ``I saw the Earth and how pretty it was,'' he said. ``It was at
that point that it wasn't scary to me anymore, and it was in fact
beautiful.''
   Low, 33, born in Cleveland, received a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering from Cornell and a master's in aeronautics
and astronautics from Stanford.
   He worked for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California
Institute of Technology for several years before becoming an
astronaut in 1984.

   Navy Lt. Cmdr. James D. Wetherbee
is making his first trip into space as pilot of the Columbia
shuttle mission.
   Wetherbee, 37, joined the astronaut corps in 1984. He said he
decided when he was 10 that he wanted to be an astronaut.
   Born in Flushing, N.Y., he received a bachelor's degree in
aerospace engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
   Wetherbee joined the Navy in 1975 and became a pilot a year
later. He was assigned to an attack squadron aboard the USS John F.
Kennedy and completed 125 night carrier landings. He also served as
a test pilot before joining NASA.
   He and his wife, Robin, have two children, Kelly, 3, and
Jennifer, 2.
