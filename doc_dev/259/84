   Space shuttle Columbia moved to the
launch pad Saturday as workers got set to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the liftoff of another spaceship with the same name,
the one that carried the first men to the moon.
   The shuttle completed a seven-hour trip to launch pad 39B shortly
before 5 a.m., and engineers and technicians began readying it for
an early August flight with five astronauts who are to release a
secret military spy satellite. Meanwhile, others made preparations
for Sunday's commemoration of the flight of the first Columbia.
   It was July 16, 1969, that an Apollo command module Columbia
blasted away from the Kennedy Space Center here with astronauts Neil
Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael Collins. Four days
later, Armstrong and Aldrin climbed into the lunar landing vehicle
Eagle and descended to the moon.
   After an historic 22 hours on the surface, the moonwalkers
rejoined Collins in mother ship Columbia for the three-day trip home.
   The three were at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., on Saturday for a ceremony there before coming here here to
join with thousands Sunday in remembering the launch of the Apollo
11 mission.
   Outside the giant shuttle assembly building, where Apollo's
Saturn 5 rockets once were put together, the former astronauts will
make brief remarks and listen to a tape recording of the final
minutes of their countdown.
   The ``taped liftoff'' will occur at 9:32 a.m. Sunday, precisely
the time they left Earth.
   As the shuttle Columbia moved to the pad, shuttle launch director
Bob Sieck looked back at its namesake.
   ``Twenty years ago there was another spaceship, also called
Columbia, and it was out at the pad,'' he said. ``It had an
important mission and an important payload. This parallels it.
Shuttle Columbia also has an important mission and an important
payload.
   ``It also will prove we have three orbiters, and that is
significant,'' Sieck said.
   Columbia will be making its first flight since the Challenger
explosion 3{ years ago. The other two shuttles, Discovery and
Atlantis, each have been launched twice since flights resumed last
September.
   After the ceremony here Sunday morning, Armstrong, Aldrin and
Collins will ride 20 miles in a motorcade to Cocoa Beach, where they
will be honored at a luncheon. On Thursday, the 20th anniversary of
the moon landing, the trio will join President Bush for a ceremony
at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
   NASA earlier had set July 31 as the date for launching shuttle
Columbia. But agency officials said Thursday that preparations were
behind schedule and that a liftoff now is expected during the first
week in August. A firm launch date will be set July 26 following a
two-day meeting called a flight readiness review.
   Columbia's all-military crew is to deploy a classified Defense
Department payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.
   While the counterparts from 1969 are being honored, the shuttle
astronauts will fly here Sunday from Houston, in preparation for
some practice sessions Monday and Tuesday.
   The crew is commanded by Air Force Col. Brewster H. Shaw Jr. The
others are Navy Cmdr. Richard N. Richards, Navy Cmdr. David C.
Leestma, Air Force Lt. Col. James C. Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark
N. Brown.
