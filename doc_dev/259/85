Astronaut Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, will join UC San Diego 
as a physics professor next month and is expected to be named director of 
university's California Space Institute, a school official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ride, 38, will join the UCSD faculty as a full professor on July 1 and will be 
paid $64,000 a year, said Jackie Parker, spokeswoman for the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. The space institute is based at Scripps, and both 
institutions are part of the University of California.

Parker said Ride's appointment as director of the space institute is expected 
to be announced Friday, after a meeting of the UC Board of Regents. The 
institute currently works with a $3.3-million annual research budget. It was 
created by the California Legislature in 1979. In addition to space research, 
the institute also meets with the state's aerospace industry on the research 
and development of new technologies.

Although Ride was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, Scripps released a 
brief statement from her in which she expressed approval of her new positions. 
Ride is currently at Stanford University, where she is a fellow at the Center 
for International Security and Arms Control. 
</P>
<P>
During her career as an astronaut with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, Ride flew in two space shuttle flights. She also was part of 
the team that investigated the accident of the space shuttle Challenger. Ride 
has been at Stanford since 1987. She holds several degrees from Stanford, 
including a doctorate in physics.
