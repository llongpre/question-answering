   Discovery's astronauts came home to
a hero's welcome after a nearly flawless mission that returned
Americans to space, and urged space center workers to ``make this
adventure happen again.''
   NASA officials hailed the four-day mission as a ``stunning
success'' that verified NASA's massive effort to redesign the space
shuttle after the Challenger disaster 32 months ago.
   Discovery commander Frederick Hauck, speaking Monday night to a
crowd of nearly 5,000 flag-waving Johnson Space Center workers,
called the Challenger accident a ``tremendous loss ... that
affected us very deeply.''
   ``It also made us resolved to recover from that, and we have
done that,'' Hauck added.
   ``We will never forget'' the seven astronauts who died when
Challenger exploded, he said. ``We will always remember the
sacrifice that they made.''
   Hauck guided the 97-ton shuttle through cloudless skies to a
pinpoint touchdown on the center line of the desert runway at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at 9:37 a.m. PDT Monday.
   In the most festive welcome home since early in the shuttle
program, space center workers, their families and friends lined the
Ellington Field runway Monday evening to cheer as the astronauts
stepped from two slick blue and white Gulfstream jets.
   Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and astronauts John M. Lounge, David
C. Hilmers and George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson, and their wives walked
down a red carpet between two rows of flag-waving drill team
members while a high school band played the theme from ``Star
Wars.''
   ``We just got back from the greatest adventure of our lives,''
Hilmers said. ``Each one of us knows where our place in the future
is, where Americans should be _ it's in space. So let's go back to
work tomorrow and make this adventure happen again, and again and
again.''
   The next shuttle flight is set for late November, when Atlantis
is to be launched on a secret Defense Department mission.
   Discovery landed smoothly on a dry lakebed in the Mojave Desert,
completing a 1.68-million-mile voyage that lasted four days, one
hour and 57 seconds.
   The landing was witnessed by more than 300,000 people. Many
waved American flags and ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was played
over loudspeakers.
   Hauck, waving a large American flag, led his crewmates through a
hatch and down a ramp to the runway, where they were greeted by
Vice President George Bush and top National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials.
   At a welcoming ceremony, Bush said he was proud to ``welcome the
space shuttle Discovery back to earth, back to America, and back to
the future.''
   He said the crew had shown that ``the shuttle is a strong bird
and it could and should fly again.''
   In a post-landing news conference, NASA shuttle boss Richard
Truly called the mission ``an absolutely stunning success.''
   He said the $100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, the
primary payload of Discovery's mission, has rocketed itself ``to
precisely where we want it.''
   Six of Discovery's heat-shield tiles were gouged, apparently by
debris during the launch, and others sustained ``dings'' during the
four-day voyage, John ``Tip'' Talone, the shuttle processing
director, said today.
   He said officials weren't yet sure if the debris was ice that
formed on the outside of the cold external fuel tank. Discovery had
fewer ``dings'' to other tiles than first thought, Talone said,
although he said they hadn't been counted yet.
   ``The vehicle looks beautiful,'' he said. ``It looks probably as
good or better as any vehicle we've brought in here.''
   Discovery is to be ferried back to Kennedy Space Center in
Florida atop a Boeing 747 transport. Space transportation system
manager Arnold Aldrich said the shuttle should leave Edwards on
Saturday and arrive at Kennedy on Sunday after an overnight stop in
San Antonio, Texas.
   The first shuttle flight since the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger
disaster went as planned from beginning to end.
   Discovery rocketed into orbit Thursday, and the astronauts
launched the communications satellite five hours later.
   The astronauts conducted 11 experiments in orbit, took
photographs of weather patterns and features on Earth, and tested
new escape system equipment.
   On Sunday, they remembered their fallen Challenger colleagues by
taking turns reading an emotional message that was broadcast to
Earth.
