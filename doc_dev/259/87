   Shaking off weeks of embarrassing setbacks, the U.S. space program roared toward recovery by successfully test firing the space shuttle Discovery's three big engines. 

   Senior officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reacted jubilantly to the test, which provided a powerful image of a resurgent space agency. 
"Super job; super team," NASA Administrator James Fletcher told the dozens of NASA engineers sitting in front of computer consoles in the flight control room. 
"I can remember the days of Apollo and I don't think we did any better then." 

   Test firing the Discovery was the most critical test facing NASA because it involved the actual spacecraft to be launched -- probably in October -- rather than test equipment. 
Last week, NASA scrubbed the test a moment before ignition because a balky fuel valve closed too slowly. 
This time, though, after the faulty valve was replaced, the countdown went flawlessly. 

   The shuttle's engines fired in proper sequence, releasing a scarlet torrent of flame that pounded the launch pad for 20 seconds and kicked a billowing cloud of exhaust 200 feet into the air. 
The power of the engines vibrated the wooden press stands, three miles away, and gave a taste of the shuttle's full power. 
During an actual launch, the shuttle engines supply only a portion of the power needed to launch the massive shuttle into orbit. 
Most of the power comes from two solid-fuel rocket boosters, which weren't tested yesterday because they can't be shut off once ignited. 

   The test capped a night of tension for NASA. 
Two weeks of delays had personnel on edge, and space-agency officials worried that they might be forced to postpone the test because of the threat of thunderstorms that later did soak the area. 
"I was worried about the engines," and the possibility a problem might arise within 10 seconds of ignition, said Allyn Smith, a firing-room manager. 

   NASA officials who examined data for three hours after the test said they could find only a few minor problems -- and none that would cause yet another shuttle delay. 
NASA once hoped to get the shuttle flying by early 1987, and as early as this spring agency officials spoke confidently of an August liftoff. 

   Robert Crippen, a former astronaut who gives the final go-ahead for shuttle launches, said NASA still has a "shot" at launching in late September. 
"We proved {Discovery} works well," he said. 
"We have a well-oiled team and a set of equipment that makes me confident to go ahead." 

   The shuttle still has a number of technical hurdles to clear before launch. 
Next week, NASA will test fire in Utah a solid-fuel rocket booster that has holes bored into it to see how well the booster's backup seals contain escaping gases. 
A faulty rocket seal led to the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986, which killed seven astronauts and grounded the shuttle fleet. 

   Meanwhile, here at Kennedy Space Center, engineers next week will start to repair a tiny steering-motor leak deep in the orbiter. 
NASA proposes, for the first time, to cut into the orbiter while it sits on the launch pad to clamp the leak. 
Thomas Utsman, Kennedy's deputy director, played down the difficulty of the task. 
"It's not a chainsaw massacre," he said. 

   NASA is doing its best to keep Discovery on the launch pad. 
Pulling it back to the hangar would delay the launch by a month or so and would erase any gains the agency made yesterday in portraying itself as being on the mend. 

   Separately, NASA said it signed a contract with Boeing Co. to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft to ferry shuttles from landing sites to the Kennedy Space Center. 
The contract is valued at $55 million. 
NASA already has one such shuttle carrier, but it wants a second as a backup.
