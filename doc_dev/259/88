   Today is Thursday, April 19, the 109th day of 1990. There are
256 days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On April 19, 1775, the American Revolutionary War began with the
Battles of Lexington and Concord.
   On this date:
   In 1782, the Netherlands recognized American independence.
   In 1824, the English romantic poet Lord Byron died in
Missolonghi, Greece.
   In 1897, the first American marathon race was run from
Hopkinton, Mass., to Boston. The winner was John J. McDermott, who
ran the course in 2:55:10.
   In 1910, after weeks of being viewed through telescopes,
Halley's Comet was reported visible to the naked eye in Curacao.
   In 1933, the United States went off the gold standard.
   In 1943, thousands of Jews living in the Warsaw Ghetto began
their fight against Nazi occupation forces.
   In 1951, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, relieved of his command by
President Truman, bade farewell to Congress, saying, ``Old soldiers
never die; they just fade away.''
   In 1965, the oldest all-news radio station in the United States,
WINS-AM in New York, began its round-the-clock news programming.
   In 1975, India announced it had launched its first satellite,
from the Soviet Union atop a Soviet rocket.
   In 1982, astronauts Sally K. Ride and Guion S. Bluford Jr.
became the first woman and first black to be tapped for U.S. space
missions.
   Ten years ago: Barbara and Kenneth Timm, the mother and
stepfather of Sgt. Kevin Hermening, one of the American hostages in
Iran, arrived in Tehran to visit their son.
   Five years ago: The space shuttle Discovery landed at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., after a mission marred by a deployed satellite
that failed to operate properly.
   One year ago: 47 sailors were killed when a gun turret exploded
aboard the USS Iowa. In New York, an investment banker jogging in
Central Park was brutally beaten, raped and left for dead _ but
survived. Six youths are accused of the attack.
   Today's birthdays: Actor-comedian Dudley Moore is 55. Actress
Elinor Donahue is 53. Tennis player Sue Barker is 34.
   Thought for today: ``The charm, one might say the genius of
memory, is that it is choosy, chancy and temperamental: it rejects
the edifying cathedral and indelibly photographs the small boy
outside, chewing a hunk of melon in the dust.'' _ Elizabeth Bowen,
Irish-born author (1899-1973).
