   Technicians used glue for a quick fix
on Atlantis' nose Wednesday and began loading the space shuttle with
fuel for a Thursday launch on a top-secret military mission. An
approaching storm loomed as the only obstacle to liftoff.
   The glue was a last-minute substitute for two bolts on an access
panel that could not be tightened. Replacing them would have meant a
delay.
   After deciding the glue would hold, NASA rolled back the service
tower which has surrounded the shuttle, clearing the way to fill the
huge external fuel tank with a half-million gallons of liquid oxygen
and liquid hydrogen.
   ``Fueling is under way. That's all we can say at this point,''
NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said at 11:35 p.m.,
   The start of fueling, another of many milestones leading to a
launching, followed a late-evening weather assessment by shuttle
managers.
   The bolts were two of 10 that secure a 24-by-18 inch access cover
on the right side of the shuttle's nose. The access plate, which is
covered by 14 of the shuttle's heat protection tiles, is normally
removed before flight to fuel a tank for the steering rockets the
shuttle uses while in orbit.
   The problem surfaced as workmen replaced the cover.
   ``We have to have to have assurance that panel isn't going to
come off in flight,'' said Lisa Malone, a Kennedy Space Center
spokeswoman.
   Weathermen, meanwhile, continued to predict that there was an 80
percent chance the weather would not permit Atlantis to be launched
on Thursday.
   The forecast was for low clouds, winds up to 23 mph and a 40
percent likelihood of rain.
   ``There is a possibility that a front will come through and
things will clear out,'' said Capt. Tom Strange, an Air Force
weatherman. ``There is a slight chance of that.''
   If there is sufficient clearing, it will come toward the end of
the three-hour launch opportunity that begins at 6:32 a.m. EST,
Strange said. He predicted that Friday morning looked slightly
better, but that winds would still be a problem.
   ``Saturday is looking a little bit better,'' he said.
   Atlantis pilot Guy S. Gardner, an Air Force lieutenant colonel,
practiced emergency landings on the space center's three-mile runway
Thursday in a plane specially outfitted to handle like the shuttle.
The four other military men on the mission _ shuttle commander
Robert L. Gibson and mission specialists Richard M. Mullane, Jerry
L. Ross and William M. Shepherd _ flew in T-38 jets around the cape
to acclimate their bodies to flight.
   The shuttle reportedly is carrying a $500 million spy satellite
called Lacrosse which nearly fills the 60-foot long cargo bay.
Sources say it is to be dropped overboard and placed in a
world-girdling orbit that takes it over 80 percent of the Soviet
Union.
   Its intelligence gathering ability is such, according to sources,
that it can gather detailed radar images _ through clouds and
darkness _ to help verify compliance with arms control agreements.
It eventually will serve as a radar eye to guide America's B-2
stealth bomber.
   At this space center, the launch control room will be manned only
by personnel with top secret clearances, and the flight will be
directed from another secure control center at NASA's Johnson Space
Center in Houston. Once the satellite is released, its radioed
commands will come from an Air Force facility in Sunnyvale, Calif.
   All space-to-ground communication will be encoded and there will
be only the barest of public announcements, in contrast with the
launch-to-liftoff eavesdropping that is usual on shuttle missions.
   Lt. Col. Joe Purka, an Air Force spokesman, said the odds were
only one in five that the weather would meet minimum requirements
for landing on the runway should an emergency develop in the early
minutes of flight.
   The forecast was for clouds at 4,000 feet over the runway;
mission rules say clouds can be no lower than 8,000 feet.
   The rules include winds of no more than 19 mph from the south or
28 mph from any direction, no rain at the pad or in the flight path
and no thunderstorms within five miles.
