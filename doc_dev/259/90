   Five astronauts scheduled to orbit
the Earth on Christmas climbed aboard space shuttle Columbia on
Friday for the final two hours of a successful practice countdown.
   The test, which began Thursday, covered the final 24 hours of an
actual count and provided training for both the launch team and the
astronauts, who checked spacecraft communications circuits and
other systems just as they will on launch day.
   ``Everything proceeded smoothly during today's terminal
countdown demonstration test,'' reported NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone.
   Columbia is scheduled to be launched Dec. 18, but officials
report the schedule is tight and liftoff might have to be delayed a
day or two. Shuttle managers will select a launch date next Tuesday
after a two-day flight readiness review.
   During the 10-day mission, the astronauts are to release a Navy
communications satellite and then track down and retrieve for
return to Earth a science satellite that has been orbiting the
globe for nearly six years.
   Once the Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite is secure in
the cargo bay, the crew members are scheduled to conduct medicial
and materials processing experiments for five days.
   They said they are planning something special for their
Christmas in space, but won't reveal what it is.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein is the commander, Jim Wetherbee is
the pilot and the mission specialists are Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha
Ivins and David Lowe.
