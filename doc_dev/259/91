   NASA tried to determine
Saturday who is responsible for a small bag of cocaine discovered
in a hangar where space shuttlesare readied for launch, a space
agency spokeswoman said.
   ``This is the first time cocaine has been found in a Kennedy
Space Center facility and it is considered an isolated incident,''
said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   She said the cocaine was found Friday under a desk in one of the
maintenance areas in the Orbiter Processing Facility, where shuttle
repairs are performed.
   ``It was a very small amount,'' Ms. Malone said.
   Officials had not determined who the cocaine belonged to and no
arrests had been made, she said.
   The investigation is led by a team of security officers from
NASA, Lockheed Space Operations Co. and EG&amp;G Florida Inc.
   Lockheed holds the multibillion dollar Kennedy Space Center
contract to prepare shuttles for launch and landing. EG&amp;G provides
security services for the space center.
