   Forecasters said Saturday there is
only a 40 percent chance that weather at the Kennedy Space Center
will be satisfactory on Monday to launch space shuttle Columbia on
a 10-day mission.
   ``It does not look all that good right now,'' said Terri
Brasher, a spokeswoman for Air Force weather forecasters. She
ticked off potential problems: poor visibility, a thick layer of
clouds hanging low over the launch area and rain, but said ``we
remain optimistic.''
   Ed Priselac, the space shuttle weather officer, said odds
against a launch on Monday because of bad weather were 60 percent
because of a front moving into Florida. Under NASA's inflexible
rules, rain in the launch path or visibility less than seven miles
would cause a launch to be scrubbed.
   A postponement would be the fourth for Columbia, whose mission
on this 33rd shuttle flight is to launch one satellite and to
retrieve another. By doubling the time in space from the normal
five days, NASA hopes to acquire data on the astronauts' long
exposure to weightlessness as well as that of their ship.
   The object is to modify Columbia, alone among the three
shuttles, for long duration flights. A 16-day flight is planned for
1992, to be followed eventually by missions of up to 28 days.
   These are stepping stones for a permanently manned space station
in which astronauts would spend six months in orbit, and for
flights to Mars, which could take up to two years.
   Only once before, in November-December 1983, has a shuttle
remained in space for 10 days.
   The space agency reported no problems in readying the ship for
its ninth flight since the countdown began Thursday.
   NASA test conductor Mike Leinbach said the weather outlook would
be evaluated late Sunday night before workers start the flow of a
half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into
Columbia's fuel tanks.
   Plans are for Columbia to catch up with the Long Duration
Exposure Facility _ a 30-foot-long satellite launched from the
shuttle in 1984 _ move in front of it, and grapple it from above
with the shuttle's robot arm.
   The satellite was to have been retrieved after one year of
exposing 57 experiments to the rigors of space. But budget problems
and the Challenger disaster delayed the rescue mission until now.
   Bill Kinard, chief scientist on the project, said the extra time
in space has been a bonanza.
   ``Almost all the experiments have benefited,'' he said. ``LDEF
is a virtual treasure trove of science and technology information.''
   Included among the materials exposed to space are 12{ million
tomato seeds, which will be distributed among students from grade 5
through university levels to study genetic and other changes.
   If not retrieved and brought back to Earth in Columbia's cargo
bay, the satellite is expected to reenter the atmosphere and burn
up by March 9. Its scientific mission would be wasted.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off Monday between 8:10 a.m. EST
and 9:08. The day of the satellite retrieval depends on the exact
time of launch and could be Thursday, Saturday or Sunday.
   First, however, 24 hours after the liftoff, the astronauts will
release a Navy communications satellite _ the fifth in a series _
from their cargo bay.
   The astronauts, who flew here Friday from their training base in
Houston, were briefed on the weather and other aspects of the
flight today.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee practiced
shuttle landings in a jet outfitted to operate like the shuttle.
The other crew members are mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar,
Marsha Ivins and David Low.
