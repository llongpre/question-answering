<LEADPARA>  Cracked door hinges on Discovery could delay the shuttle's military mission
next month by up to a month if the orbiter has to be returned to the hangar
for repairs, NASA said today.;    NASA's two other shuttles may have similar
cracks, said Karl Kristofferson, a spokesman for the space agency.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We're looking at the other orbiters to see if they have the same problem.
There is a possibility that the problem exists on the other orbiters,"
Kristofferson said.;    The cracks on Discovery were found on each of the four
metal hinges on two flapper doors that close after the external tank drops off
shortly after liftoff. Three cracks were discovered at the launch pad Monday;
the fourth hinge was found to be cracked this morning.;    The plumbing for
liquid hydrogen feeds through one door, while the other door contains the
pipes for liquid oxygen.;    Two of Discovery's cracks are 2 inches long and
about a tenth of an inch wide. The other two cracks are much smaller and may
penetrate only a protective layer of anti-corrosive paint, said NASA
spokeswoman Lisa Malone.;    The shuttles Atlantis and Columbia appear to have
small cracks on at least one hinge apiece, but it's not yet known whether
those fractures go beyond the paint, Malone said.;    Discovery's hinges may
have been cracked for some time, and officials are debating whether it is safe
to fly the shuttle with the cracks, Kristofferson said. It is crucial that
both doors be closed during the shuttle's return to Earth to keep out the
intense heat of re-entry.;    "Maybe it's flown this way for a long time. We
don't know," Kristofferson said.;    The hinges cannot be welded because they
are made of aluminum alloy, Kristofferson said. Engineers are considering
putting metal over the cracked hinges to strengthen them, but it's not known
whether that job could be done while the shuttle is in an upright position at
the launch pad.;    If Discovery must be rolled back to the hangar for
repairs, liftoff could be delayed for a month. NASA has been working toward a
launch around March 9.;    As engineers assess the problems, NASA is
proceeding with plans for the year's first shuttle flight. Discovery's seven
astronauts today began a two-day countdown demonstration test at Kennedy Space
Center.;    Mission managers still plan to meet next week to set an official
launch date.;    Last year's shuttle schedule was disrupted by fuel leaks.
Three of the nine flights that were planned for 1990 were delayed until this
year. In all, NASA hopes to launch seven shuttle missions this year.;    "I'm
sure there are a lot of people that are getting that 'Here we go again'
feeling," Kristofferson said. "The team has been through this so many times.
Hopefully, it will be a problem that can be solved fairly quickly."  </TEXT>
