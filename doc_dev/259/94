   Atlantis and its five astronauts
safely returned home from a secret military mission Tuesday,
gliding smoothly to the first space shuttle landing in Florida in
five years.
   The shuttle, diverted from the California desert because of high
winds and damp runways, swooped through a clear, brilliant blue sky
and touched down at Kennedy Space Center at 4:43 p.m. Its arrival
was heralded by the customary twin sonic booms.
   ``Welcome home. It sure was a beautiful sight,'' Mission Control
told the crew.
   It was Kennedy's sixth shuttle landing; the last one was in
1985, when Discovery blew a tire.
   Workers had to scramble to prepare for the landing, assembling a
convoy of support vehicles and bringing in extra personnel.
Atlantis had begun its mission Thursday with an unusual nighttime
liftoff.
   ``We're here in Florida and we didn't expect to be here when we
left,'' Atlantis' commander Richard Covey said before leaving with
his crew Tuesday night for Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   ``The KSC folks did a good job of getting ready for us, and they
did a super job of getting us out of town last Thursday night when
we said we were going to go,'' Covey said.
   About 250 people, including two busloads of workers from the
launch control center, watched the landing from bleachers and a
grassy strip adjoining the paved runway. They whistled and cheered,
waving small American flags.
   Launch director Bob Sieck was among about a half-dozen NASA
officials who greeted Covey, pilot Frank Culbertson Jr. and the
rest of the crew.
   ``It's very special, just like the launch,'' Sieck said. ``You
have to remember that half the workforce (at Kennedy) has never
seen a shuttle landing.''
   ``They worked so hard to get it off, it's only fair that they
should see it land,'' said NASA safety official Al Parrish.
   William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program, said a
quick check of the shuttle showed it to be ``very clean'' with
dings on only a few of the heat-resistant tiles.
   Atlantis was supposed to land Monday at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., but high wind forced Mission Control to call off the plan
and extend the shuttle's flight. Flight director Randy Stone said
Atlantis had enough power and supplies to stay aloft until
Thursday, although it's doubtful NASA would wait until then to
bring the shuttle home.
   A quarter-inch of rain fell on the Mojave Desert lakebed late
Monday and early Tuesday, creating pools of water on the natural
surface runways and making them unsuitable for landing. The
concrete runway would have been the only option there on Tuesday
and probably on Wednesday.
   The outlook for Wednesday at Edwards was no better, prompting
NASA to opt for Kennedy. The sky over Kennedy was clear Tuesday,
and wind speed was well within landing limits.
   Kennedy's 2.8-mile-long paved runway, which has 1,000-feet
overruns on both ends and is 300 feet wide, provides less room for
maneuvering than the wide-open desert. Discovery, the last shuttle
to land at Kennedy, blew a tire and sustained brake damage during a
1985 landing.
   Atlantis had been orbiting amid a Pentagon-imposed silence since
Thursday. Sources said the astronauts deployed a satellite Friday
to spy on Iraq by either photographic surveillance or electronic
eavesdropping.
   In addition to Covey, an Air Force colonel, and Culbertson, a
Navy commander, the all-military crew has three mission
specialists: Army Maj. Charles Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col. Carl Meade
and Marine Col. Robert Springer.
   The mission was the seventh and last secret shuttle flight for
the Defense Department. Two more Pentagon missions are planned for
the shuttle, but the cargoes are unclassified.
   Atlantis was supposed to lift off in July with the spy
satellite, but was grounded by hydrogen leaks. The spacecraft
reportedly was modified to observe the Persian Gulf while the
shuttle was being fixed.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is preparing
for its next shuttle flight, an astronomy mission that has been on
hold since May. Columbia is scheduled to lift off with seven
astronauts and the $150 million Astro observatory in early
December.
   NASA saved $1 million by landing Atlantis at Kennedy and about a
week in shuttle processing time since the ship does not have to be
transported now across the country. The agency has modified
Kennedy's landing strip and developed new shuttle brakes with the
intent of landing on a regular basis in Florida in the next year or
so.
   Twenty-nine of the 37 shuttle flights to date have ended at
Edwards. Columbia was diverted to White Sands, N.M., in 1982
because the desert lakebed was flooded.
   The shuttle Challenger's Jan. 28, 1986, flight ended 73 seconds
after liftoff in an explosion that killed seven astronauts.
