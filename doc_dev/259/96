   NASA postponed the start of the
countdown for space shuttle Discovery by eight hours Sunday because
of lagging preparations, but still aimed for a Thursday morning
liftoff.
   ``We're still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and that's
the plan,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.
   The countdown was rescheduled to begin at 8 a.m. EDT Monday for
the first manned American space flight since the Challenger blew up
over the Atlantic 32 months ago.
   The space agency had added 27 unprogrammed hours to the
countdown as insurance for last-minute problems, and Sieck said
eight hours of that time would be used in advance to complete the
work of replacing panels and work platforms.
   ``We don't want those people to have to do that under the gun
with the clock counting,'' he said. ``So we said, `take all the
time it takes and we'll delay the call to stations to accommodate
that.'''
   NASA had planned to start the countdown at midnight, but
``buttoning up'' the aft end of the spaceplane _ akin to closing
the hood on a car _ was delayed by a problem that had the potential
of postponing the launch for two days.
   Low voltage readings were found in an electrical circuit that
triggers the explosive charges used to separate the shuttle from
its fuel tank when the tank is empty. Eventually engineers
determined that the fault was in a ground circuit, which does not
affect the flight.
   The winged spaceplane rides aloft attached at three points to
the 154-foot-long external tank. At 8{ minutes into flight, just
before the shuttle reaches orbit, the explosive devices release the
tank and it breaks up in the atmosphere as it falls toward the
Indian Ocean.
   Discovery's launch date has been changed five times in the past
as new problems cropped up in getting ready for STS-26, the 26th
mission of the Space Transportation System.
   The Cape Canaveral area was bracing for an influx of visitors
comparable to the first flight of the space shuttle in 1981 when
more than a million crowded the roads outside the launch center.
   The renewed interest, too, was evident at the press site where
4,500 representatives of the news media applied for credentials. By
contrast, there were 500 journalists here when the Challenger
exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, 73 seconds after liftoff.
   When Discovery lifts off, with five veteran astronauts aboard,
it will be a far different vehicle than on its six previous
flights. The orbiter has had 210 changes and the solid fuel rockets
had 145.
   The booster rockets, which supply more than 70 percent of the
power to get the shuttle off the ground, were of the greatest
concern since it was the right-hand rocket that leaked flaming gas
and doomed the Challenger with its seven astronauts.
   The joints of the segmented boosters, which permitted the leak,
have been completely redesigned and have been tested in five
full-scale firings. But their only real test will come when the
Discovery lifts off its seaside pad _ the same one used for the
first time for Challenger.
   The accident grounded the manned space program for the
intervening 32 months and caused a complete rethinking in official
attitudes toward the shuttle. The Air Force, which was to have been
NASA's biggest customer _ taking one-third of shuttle space for
satellite deliveries _ has been building its own fleet of
expendable rockets.
   Because of the extensive redesign NASA is treating the flight as
it did the first. The ``hold time'' in the countdown sequence _ a
cushion to fix any problems that might crop up _ adds up to 40
hours, almost equalling work time.
   ``It's as safe as the designers could make it,'' Merlino told
reporters Sunday.
   Navy Capt. Frederick H. Hauck and his four-man crew of
astronauts will fly to the launch site from their Houston training
center Monday afternoon for last minute briefings and some practice
landing on the Kennedy runway in an aircraft that handles like a
shuttle.
   Discovery's cargo will be a $100 million communications
satellite that NASA needs for communications with future shuttles,
and 11 scientific experiments.
