   Discovery's astronauts, safely in
orbit Monday after a weather-delayed launch, set free a $100 million
satellite to complete a globe-spanning network that will let future
spacefarers call Mission Control at almost any time.
   The 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, its double
parasol-like antennae folded, slipped clear of Discovery's cargo bay
at 4:10 p.m. EST and floated into space.
   ``We had a good deploy, on time,'' said Discovery mission
specialist Robert C. Springer.
   At a critical moment in the deployment, an unexplained electronic
signal momentarily jammed a computer used to deploy the satellite,
but then, just as mysteriously, the machine cleared up and appeared
normal.
   ``We didn't get any (more) of those spurious signals,'' Springer
said.
   Mission control confirmed that data on the ground showed that the
computer was functioning normally.
   An hour after the deployment, TDRS's powerful first-stage rocket
fired and sent the craft toward a new, higher orbit.
   Kathy Sullivan, an astronaut acting as Mission Control
communicator with Discovery, told the crew the rocket firing was so
accurate that a ``trim burn,'' used to correct errors, was not
required.
   ``Fantastic news,'' came the reply from Discovery. ``Thanks a
lot.''
   At 10:23 p.m. EST, a second-stage rocket fired, and within 30
minutes the satellite reached its work station 22,300 miles over the
Atlantic Ocean.
   ``It was a good burn of normal duration,'' Mission Control
announced.
   Putting TDRS in place was the major goal of the nation's 28th
space shuttle flight. The rest of the five-day mission will be
devoted to a group of science experiments, ranging from a study of
how bones heal in space to a test of a spacecraft radiator system.
   Deployment of the satellite came 6 hours, 12 minutes after
Discovery leaped from its seaside launch pad and raced out of view
across a clear Florida sky in a launch that marked a successful
beginning to NASA's plan to fly seven shuttles this year.
   Discovery, its rockets firing flawlessly, charged smoothly into
orbit with five astronauts, the communications satellite and a cargo
of experiments that includes four rats with clipped bones, and 32
chicken eggs.
   ``It's a great start to a long launch season,'' launch director
Bob Sieck told a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center.
   The 9:57 a.m. EST liftoff was an hour and 50 minutes later than
planned. Early-morning fog _ so dense it obscured the launch pad
from just a short distance away _ caused some delay, but the major
problem was winds five miles overhead. Officials feared powerful
shear forces could tear the spacecraft apart as it raced upward
faster than the speed of sound.
   To compensate for the winds, a computer aboard Discovery was
quickly reprogrammed to adjust the ship's flight angle. The stalled
countdown clock was restarted and then ticked without hesitation to
liftoff.
   Mission commander Michael L. Coats, a 43-year-old Navy captain,
leads a crew that includes Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, 46, the
mission pilot; Springer, 46, a Marine colonel; Dr. James. M. Bagian,
37, a physician, and Marine Col. James F. Buchli, 43.
   Once in place, TDRS will become the third and final link in a
communications constellation that is vital to NASA's future space
plans.
   By using the satellite network, the space agency will be able to
exchange radio messages with the shuttle and other satellites at
least 85 percent of the time they are in orbit. A small sliver over
the Indian Ocean is the only part of the shuttle orbit blocked from
contact.
   Before TDRS, NASA depended on ground stations, outposts with huge
dish antennae sprinkled at points around the globe. Shuttle
astronauts could speak to Mission Control only as they overflew the
ground stations, a link that covered only about 15 percent of each
mission. NASA will soon close six ground stations at a savings of $3
million a month.
   Establishing the TDRS network has been a struggle for NASA.
   TDRS-1 was placed into orbit in 1983, but a rocket stage failed
and the agency was forced to use small attitude control jets to
maneuver the satellite into place, a process that took many weeks
and burned most of the precious control fuel.
   The second TDRS was destroyed, along with seven astronauts, in
the explosion of space shuttle Challenger in 1986.
   NASA considered the communications network so important that the
main goal of the first mission following Challenger last September
was to put a new TDRS in place. The satellite was launched smoothly
and now hangs high over the Pacific Ocean.
   TDRS-1, now ailing and old, will become a spare once the third
satellite delivered by Discovery is in place.
   Sharing the shuttle cabin with Coats and his crew are four rats,
32 fertilized chicken eggs and a small garden of plants.
   The rats are part of an experiment to test how injured bones
would heal in the weightlessness of orbit. Before they were loaded
into cages on Discovery, small chips of bones were clipped from each
of the rodents. When the rats are returned to Earth, the healing of
their bones will be compared the healing experienced by similar rats
on the ground.
   The eggs are developing embryos at the same time as a group of
eggs left on Earth. The growth rate of the two groups of eggs will
be compared after the mission.
   A similar comparative study is being conducted with two types of
plants being grown aboard Discovery.
