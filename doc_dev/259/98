   NASA began the countdown Thursday
for Monday's launch of space shuttle Columbia on a 10-day satellite
rescue mission.
   The clock began ticking at 4 p.m. when NASA test director Jim
McKnight issued the traditional call to stations at the launch pad
and in the control center. Liftoff is scheduled at 8:10 a.m. Monday
for the first of a record 10 shuttle flights planned in 1990.
   During 10 days in space, the crew of five is to deploy a Navy
communications satellite and track down and retrieve a 21,400-pound
science laboratory the size of a small bus before it falls back to
Earth on Feb. 28.
   The laboratory, which has been orbiting for nearly six years,
will be returned to Earth for a study of its 57 experiments and to
determine what has happened to it during long exposure to space.
   Liftoff had been scheduled to take place before Christmas, but
problems with the launch pad, which recently underwent a $50
million overhaul, forced a postponment. Fourteen hours of ``hold
time'' were added to the countdown to allow NASA to stop and deal
with any problems with launch pad 39A, which has not been used in
four years.
   The astronauts will fly to Cape Canaveral on Friday from their
training base in Houston to prepare for the flight.
   The commander is astronaut Dan Brandenstein. The other crew
members are pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie
Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low. Brandenstein and Dunbar have
made shuttle flights, while the others will be on their first trip.
