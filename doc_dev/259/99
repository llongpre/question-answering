   Following a successful practice
countdown with Discovery's five astronauts, NASA officials said
they hope this month to launch the first space shuttle since the
Challenger disaster nearly three years ago.
   ``You have a feeling this train is about to leave the station
and we're about to get on board,'' astronaut Mike Lounge said after
Thursday's exercise, the last major milestone before Discovery's
launch.
   ``We clearly demonstrated that we're ready to pick up the count
for real; I hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the
month,'' Kennedy Space Center Director Forrest S. McCartney told
the launch team.
   The test concluded three days of training here for the
astronauts. They flew back to Houston's Johnson Space Center, where
they planned to concentrate on flight simulator work between now
and launch time.
   Lounge and Discovery commander Rick Hauck will return here for
launch and flight readiness reviews Tuesday and Wednesday with key
shuttle managers. NASA is expected to announce a launch date after
Wednesday's meeting.
   Officials have been discussing a date from Sept. 26 to Sept. 29.
   Hauck, Lounge and the other crew members, Dick Covey, George
Nelson and Dave Hilmers, climbed aboard Discovery for the final two
hours of the practice count, pulling switches, testing
communications and monitoring systems, just as they will on launch
day.
   The only problem was with a ground communications link between
the launch control center and the spacecraft. It was corrected, but
delayed completion of the countdown 34 minutes.
   During their four-day missions, the astronauts are scheduled to
deploy a communications satellite, test new spaceship systems and
conduct science and technology experiments.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Jan. 28, 1986,
Challenger explosion that killed all seven crew members 73 seconds
after liftoff.
