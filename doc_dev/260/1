   The astrologer who advises first lady Nancy
Reagan said Tuesday that Southern Californians anxious about a
four-centuries-old prophecy of a huge earthquake this month should
stop worrying.
   Joan Quigley said the French seer Nostradamus had incomplete
data when he made his prediction in the 1500s.
   ``Centuries ago, the positions of Uranus and Neptune and Pluto
and all those planets weren't known,'' she said. ``He (Nostradamus)
knew about Saturn being where Saturn was. But he didn't know that
Uranus was right there with it.''
   She said she had predicted a big quake May 5 and had returned
home Saturday from a month in Europe after it did not materialize
and said she was confident any danger was past.
   Southern Californians have swamped earthquake information
hotlines, left the region or taken other earthquake precautions in
reaction to a vague prediction by Nostradamus and a 1981 movie
``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' now sold on videotape.
   The film, narrated by ``War of the Worlds'' prankster Orson
Welles, claimed Nostradamus said the area would be wrecked by a
huge quake this month. Some astrologers have said a big quake is
most likely this week.
   A slight quake did materialize in northern California near
Salinas early Tuesday, but there were no reports of damage.
   The earthquake hit at 5:32 a.m. with an estimated magnitude of
3.0 on the Richter scale, according to Willis Jacobs, a
geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo. He
said the epicenter was between Salinas and Watsonville. Any quake
under 3.5 on the scale is considered slight.
   Mrs. Reagan's interest in astrology was disclosed in a book by
former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, who said the first
lady used astrological predictions to influence the president's
schedule.
