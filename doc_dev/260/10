   Sales of the Bible, the Koran, and books
containing the prophecies of a 16th-century astrologer have
increased dramatically since Iraq invaded Kuwait, publishers and
booksellers say.
   From shortly after the August invasion through mid-October, the
1,300-store Waldenbooks chain showed a 67 percent increase in sales
of prophetic books such as ``The Late Great Planet Earth,''
according to Susan Arnold, company spokeswoman in Stamford, Conn.
   Sales of the Bible and the Koran also increased sharply, she
said.
   At B. Dalton Bookseller in New York, books by Nostradamus, a
French astrologer and physicist who died in 1566, are selling well,
said assistant manager Terrel Holmes.
   Nostradamus has been credited with predicting the rise of
Napoleon and Hitler and the two World Wars. Most books interpreting
his writings say he spoke of a great war occurring in the Middle
East near the end of the 20th century.
   John Lawton, religious book buyer for the 800-store B. Dalton
chain, said religious book sales are up 35 to 40 percent nationwide
since the invasion.
   ``Bible sales have gone crazy,'' said Ken Sherman, sales
representative for Thomas Nelson Publishers, of Nashville, Tenn.,
which publishes Bibles worldwide. He said sales were up 25 percent.
   Several of the Bible's prophetic books refer to the rise and
fall of Babylon, the ruins of rich lie 60 miles south of
present-day Baghdad. Some evangelicals see a coming apocalypse in
Iraq's actions.
   Most mainstream biblical scholars give little credence to such
speculation, saying such analysis takes out of context passages
that were written for a specific culture and time.
