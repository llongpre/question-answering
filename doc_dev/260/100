<LEADPARA>  Charlotte Beyers of Palo Alto hung out for about eight months in the mean
streets of San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland. She talked with the homeless
children of Telegraph Hill and of the Tenderloin, trying to understand their
lives, their hopes and fears.;    Recently Beyers produced "Shadow Children,"
an hourlong documentary on Bay Area homeless youth.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We are trying to be a voice for the kids," Beyers said. "It shows what the
disintegration of the American family is doing to the kids.";    As expected,
the homeless teen-agers didn't take too kindly to Beyers and her film crew at
first. But eventually, things worked out.;    Beyers dug up some startling
statistics.;    Half of the homeless kids have tried to commit suicide.;   
"Three-fourths of the parents of teen-agers we see don't want them back again
when we call them," Beyers quoted Robert Towbin, who runs a shelter for teens
in the Tenderloin, as saying.;    "I find that shocking," Beyers said.;    The
film is slated for television and will be distributed nationally to schools.
Beyers paid for the documentary with money from her previous documentaries
about AIDS and "crack" addicts. The film is directed by Harry Mathias, who was
nominated for an Oscar in 1980. The documentary is photographed and edited by
Richard Scott of Berkeley, winner of four Emmy awards.; HEALTH OF PLANET: The
Peninsula Conservation Center is presenting a slide show series called, "2001:
An Environmental Vision." It is a sort of report card on Mother Earth.
Photographer and naturalist Steve Rutledge will check the health of our
planet.;    The talk will begin at 7:30 p.m. next Tuesday and continues on
Feb. 5 and Feb. 26. Admission costs $3, and free for center members. For more
information, call (415) 494-9301.; WHAT'S SHAKIN'?: The last thing we need is
another earthquake. Controversial geologist Jim Berkland said there's a 50
percent chance that a 5.0 magnitude or larger quake will occur within 140
miles of Los Angeles by today. Worse yet, Berkland predicted an 80 percent
possibility for such a quake by Jan. 31.;    "Based on the largest number of
missing animals in the L.A. Times classifieds in the last 10 years, 50 percent
higher than normal tides associated with the partial eclipse of the sun on
Jan. 15, and the unusual earthquake drought of the last few months in the Los
Angeles area, I am calling for a serious earthquake," Berkland said in a
prepared statement.;    Berkland's unorthodox methods of earthquake prediction
have been criticized by other geologists.  </TEXT>
