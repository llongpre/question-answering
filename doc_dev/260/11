<LEADPARA>  PRODUCER David Wolper is bringing us Wednesday's NBC "Nostradamus: The Man Who
Saw Tomorrow" -- a program he's quick to admit has an odd history. It started
out as a big-screen documentary narrated by the late Orson Welles six years
ago, moved into the home video market -- and now parts of the film are
returning in an hourlong special hosted by Charlton Heston.;    "Some of the
predictions Welles talked about in the film are amazing," says Wolper, who
adds that among the material is a prediction from the 16th century psychic
that Russia and the United States would join together to fight a demon who
would rise up in the Middle East. "NBC came to me about a month ago; they
thought we could do something with the film. Everyone was interested." By the
way, Wolper also notes, "Nostradamus predicted that shortly after the
beginning of the 21st century, there would begin a thousand-year period of
peace on earth."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now all we've got to do is hang in there for another nine years.;    The
Wolper organization is also already promising that his "Best of the Worst"
series for Fox Broadcasting "won't be mean." The prospective half-hour show,
created by Wolper's son Mark and Greg Kinnear, is set to bring viewers the
very worst of everything from hairstyles to TV pilots. "We want to be very
careful to keep it tongue-in-cheek, and not to hurt people's feelings," says
the Nice Guy executive. "I think it's going to be a lot of fun.";    SOUND OF
MUSIC: Chicago is talking with the Doobie Brothers and with Hall &amp; Oates about
joining forces for a string of special concert dates starting in spring.;   
That's the word from Chicago songwriter/keyboardist Robert Lamm, who says
meetings are currently going on about the matter. He anticipates that Chicago
will share the stage "With one (act) or the other. It would be too hard to
coordinate schedules for three different groups -- not to mention all that
equipment." Chicago toured with The Beach Boys a couple years ago, and Lamm
says his team enjoyed the double bill. "And it's more fun for the audience."
Not to mention a bigger draw.;    Meanwhile, with Chicago's new "Chasin' The
Wind" single and "CHICAGO TWENTY-1" Warner/Reprise album just off the
launching pad, Lamm is in the midst of cutting a yet-untitled solo album
tentatively set for release this fall, with Phil Ramone serving as producer.
It's Lamm's second lone effort -- his first since the early '70s -- and he
reports, "It doesn't sound anything like Chicago. There's no brass in it. . .
. The direction of the first five tunes is dance rock with intelligent
lyrics.";    'LAST' NOT LEAST: A May 13 start in North Carolina has been set
for 20th Century Fox's remake of "The Last of the Mohicans" with Daniel
Day-Lewis starring as Hawkeye, the Indian scout. Still being cast for the
latest adaptation of the classic James Fenimore Cooper tale are Hawkeye's
Indian companions. The new big-screen "Mohicans" (the last "Last" was in 1936
with Randolph Scott) is the baby of "Miami Vice" creator Michael Mann, who
co-wrote and will produce and direct the big-screen saga.  </TEXT>
