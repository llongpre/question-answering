   Johnny Carson returned to television
Wednesday despite a writers strike, giving a monologue of his own
making in which he wisecracked that astrology in the White House
finally explains ``the loony tunes things that have been coming out
of Washington.''
   ``The Tonight Show'' had been in reruns since shortly after the
Writers Guild of America struck the film and TV industry March 7.
   Carson announced last week that reruns of the show would end and
he would return to the air, writing his own monologues. Carson, who
is not a member of the guild, said at that time possibilities of
reaching an agreement with striking writers had been exhausted.
   On Wednesday, he said the real reason for coming back stemmed
from the brouhaha over revelations about the influence of astrology
in the White House.
   ``I just could not stay away any longer from all things that are
going on in the country. I was compelled to come back,'' Carson
said. ``I'm a Scorpio on the cusp. .... You know, we finally have a
clue now as to what the hell (are) the loony tunes things that have
been coming out of Washington.''
   Carson referred to revelations by former White House chief of
staff Donald Regan that first lady Nancy Reagan regularly consulted
an astrologer to determine the timing of President Reagan's
movements.
   Carson said he had not been aware there was a new Cabinet
position, Secretary of Health, Education and Soothsaying.
   He also made brief mention of the strike in both a sincere and
joking tone.
   ``We're glad to be back. As far as the writers strike we're not
going to discuss it,'' he said. ``I have a lot of friends who are
writers. We hope they join us soon. It is not fun to come to work
when you see your friends who you've known for many years standing
out on a picket line.
   Then he quipped, ``And it's a weird picket line. The writers are
out there holding up these signs and there's nothing on them.''
   Carson explained to out-of-towners that there had been
excitement in Los Angeles because of persistent rumors that
Nostradamus, a 16th century astrologer, forecast an earthquake for
a city widely believed to be Los Angeles.
   ``He was a flim-flam man of the 16th century,'' Carson observed.
``If Nostradamus were alive today he would be Geraldo Rivera,'' he
said, referring to the TV personality who opened Al Capone's vault
to great hype but found next to nothing.
   Carson's production company, Carson Tonight Inc., was rebuffed
in efforts to get either a waiver from the guild or reach an
independent agreeement that would permit the writers to return to
work.
