While it is generally acknowledged that an outsider reviewer's position may not 
represent a publication's editorial position, it is also true that a 
publication must share some responsibility for the merit or the failures of its 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Your reviewer, Malcolm Dean, is a believer in, or some kind of devotee of, 
astrology, and from that stance dismisses James Randi's "The Mask of 
Nostradamus." 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically of astrology's believers, Dean totally fails to address the 
substance of Randi's evidence of Nostradamus' fakery or indeed the actual 
content of his book. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at least one reader finds it alarming that one of the nation's largest 
daily papers indirectly lends support to belief in astrology, which all 
reputable scientific authorities have and continue to dismiss as nonsense. You 
would better serve your readers by now having Randi's book reviewed instead of 
its serving as a peg for Dean's polemics. Incidentally, Dean's antagonism to 
Randi is of long standing, so one questions the propriety of assigning the 
review to an avowed opponent.
