<LEADPARA>  A frightening rumor about an impending mass murder is spreading across college
campuses in New England, prompting some schools to call meetings and issue
statements to comfort worried students.;   "We had to tell students, 'Relax,
you're not going to die in your sleep,' " said Donald Stewart, a spokesman for
Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.  </LEADPARA>

URBAN LEGEND OR WARNING, NEW ENGLANDERS ARE
SPOOKED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The rumor, which has been heard in at least six colleges from New Hampshire
to Connecticut, takes several forms.;   In one version, a psychic appearing on
the Oprah Winfrey show has predicted a massacre on a New England campus
sometime around Halloween. In another, the killings are supposedly predicted
in the writings of Nostradamus, the 16th-century mystic.;   "Some students
thought it was hysterically funny," said Grace McNamara, a spokeswoman at
Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., where the rumor began spreading last
week.;   But at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, women living in
two dormitories were so frightened that nearly 100 of them met with the campus
police chief.;   "Who knows, maybe UMass was mentioned by Nostradamus 400
years ago," said Preston Foreman, an editor of the Daily Collegian, the
student newspaper. "People here are taking this fairly seriously.";   Linda
Simon, a spokeswoman for the Winfrey show, said no predictions of a massacre
had been made on the program. "I don't know how this got started," she said.  </TEXT>
