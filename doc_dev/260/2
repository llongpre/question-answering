   The nation's second-largest city survived May
without being destroyed by a disastrous earthquake, contrary to
dire predictions by astrologers and followers of the 16th-century
French seer Nostradamus.
   That nugget of good news is followed by a dire prediction of
another sort, this time from members of the scientific community
who say apocalyptic prophecies are a kind of industry that thrives
in trend-conscious California.
   Astronomer Andy Fraknoi said he expects more somber prophecies
because ``for this rather large and lucrative New Age business to
keep churning out sales, they need something cosmic every year or
so.''
   Fraknoi, executive officer of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific in San Francisco, blamed the attention the Nostradamus
prediction got on the media for failing to emphasize that
scientists said the predictions were bunk.
   The seismic scare was spurred by a purported prediction in vague
poems by the astrologer Nostradamus, who died in 1566. In the 1981
movie, ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' Orson Welles claimed
Nostradamus forecast a quake would destroy the ``new city,''
supposedly Los Angeles, when certain planets were aligned in May
1988.
   Psychic Hamilton Farmer also predicted an 8.5-magnitude quake
would wreak havoc, while other psychics and astrologers offered a
variety of dates for Southern California's demise.
   Much of the doomsaying focused on May 10, although Nancy
Reagan's personal astrologer, Joan Quigley, predicted the quake
would hit May 5.
   The comic strip ``Doonesbury'' satirized the predictions, and
scientists called the forecasts nonsense, saying Nostradamus didn't
predict a quake, the planets weren't aligned and wouldn't trigger a
quake if they were.
   But thousands of truly fearful residents called hot lines at
Griffith Observatory and the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
   Some stocked up on emergency supplies and Nostradamus books and
videotapes, while others left town, including an estimated 1,000 or
more Cambodian refugees who were frightened by a strong real quake
that rocked Los Angeles last October.
   ``We need a campaign for the media to just say no _ no
astrology, no UFOs, no Bigfoot stories, no psychics,'' Fraknoi
said. ``When you get tempted, just call another journalist and
they'll help you just say no.''
   Another figure prominent in the scientific study of the heavens
criticized the prophecy business.
   ``We've gone through the month of May with extraordinary
unfounded predictions of a catastrophic earthquake in Los Angeles,
and to me, this is like yelling fire in a crowded theater. Those
who scared people should be ashamed of themselves,'' said Griffith
Observatory director Edwin Krupp.
   ``There were many different people predicting every date of the
month before we were done,'' Krupp said Tuesday. ``Perhaps to the
disappointment of those who had predicted a quake and counted on
one, the City of Los Angeles is still here.''
   About 30 quakes occur daily in Southern California, most too
small to be felt, Caltech spokesman Robert Finn said.
   The biggest quake all month in the region measured a barely
respectable 4.0 on the Richter scale on May 17, and was centered
east of Borrego Springs, about 125 miles southeast of Los Angeles,
he added. No damage or injuries were reported.
   Melissa Hatfield, an employee at the Phoenix metaphysical
bookstore in Santa Monica, said the scientists ``are pretty
close-minded about prophesying and forseeing the future.''
   So why did Los Angeles survive?
   ``From what I've heard, because I've talked to a guy who's
really looked into Nostradamus, the planets don't line up until
1999. So that's when it (the big quake) is supposed to be,'' Ms.
Hatfield said. ``It should occur May 10, 1999. So everybody was
scared for nothing. I'm moving away in 1999.''
   Krupp scoffed at that, but noted that scientists do expect a
catastrophic earthquake is inevitable. The California Office of
Emergency Services says a major, devastating quake in Southern
California is more than 50 percent likely sometime within the next
25 years.
   ``If there's a good side to this (Nostradmus scare), I'd bet a
lot of people stocked up on bottled water and canned food and did
all the other things to prepare for an earthquake,'' Finn said.
