   Black cats, ladders and cracked mirrors
move over. The Friday-the-13th superstition of the 1980s is
computer viruses, say some computer experts.
   Computer viruses are devious programs created by computer
whizzes that ``infect'' the computer's hardware and reproduce
themselves onto other software. Once confined to flashing a
harmless message on private terminals, they have been known to
erase sensitive files.
   Yet some programmers say they don't believe in computer viruses.
   ``I'm not that superstitious and I really don't see any problems
_ knock on wood,'' said Jim Gogan, research and development
director at the Microcomputing Support Center for the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``We are about as secure as things
can get.''
   ``Viruses are like the bogyman,'' said Byron C. Howes, a
computer systems manager at the UNC Educational Computing Service.
   He compared programmers who believe in them to ``people who set
little bowls of milk outside our doors to feed the dwarfs.''
   According to published reports, viruses have infected computers
at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, IBM, the U.S.
House of Representatives, universities and computer networks in
businesses overseas.
   Last year, hundreds of computers in Israel were hit with a
``time bomb'' virus designed to activate today. The virus, which
was detected and believed to have been wiped out, would have spread
and destroyed all data in any computer it had infected.
   ``I just think that the whole thing is a joke,'' said Barry B.
Cooper, owner of Commercial Software in Raleigh.
   Virus rumors, he said, were like the prediction by medieval seer
Nostradamus of a major earthquake on May 8, 1988.
   ``That didn't come true, and this won't come true,'' he said.
   He and others said they were unconcerned because they inspect
new software before using it. Some programmers have ``vaccine''
programs that alert them to someone trying to break into the system
or other tampering, Cooper said.
