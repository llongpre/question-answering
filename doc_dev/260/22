If you have been following BBC1's repeat of the late Dennis Potter's
splendid serial/musical/thriller The Singing Detective then you will want to
catch the penultimate episode at 10.15. Earlier, on the same channel, there
are two visits to Helsinki for European Athletics (6.20 and 8.30). Otherwise
radio promises a better evening. In BBC Proms 94 the BBC Philharmonic plays
pieces by Faure and Ravel and then Sibelius's Symphony No 1 (Radio 3 7.30).
In 'The Monday Play', Angel Standing by Jonathan Myerson, Timothy West plays
an academic who finds himself with a PhD student who is researching her
thesis on sexuality by working as a prostitute (7.45 Radio 4). A new series,
The Miles Kington Interview, begins with the 16th century seer Nostradamus,
played by Robert Stephens, telling of his passion for fruit preserving . . .
(9.15 Radio 4). Then, at 10.45, in a new Book At Bedtime, Anna Massey gives
the first in a 10-part reading of The Pursuit Of Love. Nancy Mitford's
funniest book is about the mores and morals of the country house set in the
1930s (10.45 Radio 4).
