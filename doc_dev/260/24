   A group of world-famous scientists intent on
debunking the claims of astrologers says it is dismayed that
President and Mrs. Reagan use ``superstition'' and ``mystical
fortune telling'' to make decisions.
   The practice, said the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, harks back to ancient
times when monarchs and emperors resorted to the musings of fortune
tellers for advice.
   ``We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval
superstitition,'' the statement said. ``Dozens of tests in recent
years by scientists can find little, if any, evidence for
astrological claims. Horoscopes have been shown under the most
rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting
future events.''
   The statement was released after reports on a forthcoming book
by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, who says Nancy
Reagan regularly consults astrologers in shaping her advice to the
president. Reagan, the book says, also regularly reads his
horoscope. The White House later confirmed the Reagans' interest in
astrology but said it did not influence any policy decisions.
   ``If the United States is to continue its leadership in
scientific research, it is vital that the public have a clear
understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience,
and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to
mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of
prognostication,'' the scientists' group said.
   Paul Kurtz, chairman of the committee, said he released the
statement to counter publicity about astrology following disclosure
of the Reagans' interest.
   ``We ask the White House to confirm to what extent astrologers
have been advisers of presidents,'' Kurtz said in the statement.
``The public has the right to know who these astrologers are and
what recommendations they have made. We ask that their claims and
alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny.''
   The scientists' committee critically analyzes assertions by
astrologers and by persons claiming unusual powers or perceptions.
Members include Nobel laureate F.H.C. Crick, two-time Nobel
laureate Murray Gell-Mann, noted psychologist B. F. Skinner, and
authors Issac Asimov and Carl Sagan.
   Andrew Fraknoi, an astronomy professor at San Francisco State
University and a member of the committee, said astrology has been
put through vigorous scientific analysis dozens of times and has
never been found to have validity.
   Fraknoi said that in one test two scientists examined more than
3,000 predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct
less than 10 percent of the time.
   ``If the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time, that's
not the type of guidance we need from the federal government,'' he
said.
   Astrologers, said Fraknoi, regularly use the positions of the
Uranus and Neptune in making predictions, even though those two
planets were not even discovered when the concept of astrology was
established in ancient times.
   Fraknoi said astrologers claim they make predictions based on
the position of planets against a background of star
constellations, using methods developed by ancient observers.
   Yet, he said, the Earth's position has shifted so that
constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing positions.
   ``In effect, all of the constellations have moved,'' said
Fraknoi. ``This puts the signs of the Zodiac off by one whole
sign.''
   The astrology concept that a person's future is shaped through
some unexplained mechanism by the position of the stars and planets
at the moment of birth also has been attacked scientifically, he
said.
   He said a researcher checked groups of men who re-enlisted in
the Marine Corps. Based on astrology, he said, such a group would
be motivated by the same or similar Zodiacal signs. Yet, said
Fraknoi, ``there was no trend whatsoever.'' The signs were randomly
distributed.
   Another astrology concept is that people are more likely to find
happiness with partners who have ``compatible signs.'' The signs,
according to astrology, are based on the time and month of birth.
   Fraknoi said a researcher checked 3,500 marriage certificates
and found that people are no more likely to pair up with those of
``compatible signs'' than they were with those of any other sign.
   Some astrologers, said Fraknoi, have suggested that the
gravitational and tidal effects of distant planets, such as Mars,
at the moment of birth can affect a person's future.
   Calculations by scientists, said Fraknoi, show that the
obstetrican who delivers a baby has a six times greater
gravitational influence on a child than the planet Mars. The tidal
effect of the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion, he
said.
   ``Is this really something on which we want to base our national
destiny?'' Fraknoi asked.
   Kurtz, in his statement, said the committee of scientists was
concerned about damage that belief in astrology may cause.
   ``Scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical
prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the
public,'' he said. ``Recent opinion polls have shown that up to 52
percent of teenagers accept the validity of astrology. The
intrusion of astrology into the highest levels of national security
thinking now is a cause for further concern.''
