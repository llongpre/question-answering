   Scientists expressed dismay Tuesday that some
White House decisions might have been based on astrology, with one
saying, ``That's not the type of guidance we need from the federal
government.''
   Andrew Fraknoi, an astronomy professor at San Francisco State
University and executive officer of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific, said that the claims of astrology have been subjected to
dozens of scientific tests and have been found totally without
foundation.
   In one test, he said, two scientists examined more than 3,000
predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct less
than 10 percent of the time.
   ``If the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time, that's
not the type of guidance we need from the federal government,''
Fraknoi said in a telephone interview from his San Francisco office.
   Meanwhile, an organization of scientists called the Committee
for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal
said in a statement:
   ``We are dismayed by reports that the White House has consulted
astrologists. We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval
superstitition. Dozens of tests in recent years by scientists can
find little, if any, evidence for astrological claims. Horoscopes
have been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail
completely in predicting future events.''
   The committee also asked the White House ``to confirm to what
extent astrologers have been advisers of presidents. The public has
the right to know who these astrologers are and what
recommendations they have made. We ask that their claims and
alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny.''
   The issue was raised by reports that former White House chief of
staff Donald T. Regan wrote in an upcoming book that Nancy Reagan
consulted astrologers to determine the timing of presidential
speeches and announcements.
   President Reagan said Tuesday that he has never based any policy
or decision on astrological forecasts, but the White House
acknowledged that Mrs. Reagan has consulted an astrologer to help
schedule the president's activities.
   Fraknoi said modern astrology uses the positions of the Uranus
and Neptune in making predictions, and yet, these planets were not
even discovered when the concept of astrology was established in
ancient times.
   Furthermore, he said, the astrological predictions presumably
are based on the alignment of planets against a background of the
stars. Yet, since the astrology system was established in ancient
times, the Earth's position has shifted slightly so that the
constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing position.
In effect, the signs of the Zodiac viewed now are not those seen by
the ancients, he said.
   Franknoi said the concepts of astrology are based on the idea
that the influence of the stars and planets have some effect on
infants as they are born. Hence, the gravitational and tidal effect
of Mars, for instance, are supposed to influence the life of a
child, he said.
   But calculations by scientists show that the obstetrican who
delivers a baby has a six times greater gravitational influence on
a child than the planet Mars, Fraknoi said. And the tidal effect of
the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion.
   ``Scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical
prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the
public,'' said the statement from the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal. ``... The intrusion
of astrology into the highest levels of national security thinking
now is a cause for further concern.
   ``If the United States is to continue its leadership in
scientific research, it is vital that the public have a clear
understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience,
and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to
mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of
prognostication,'' the statement said.
   The organization has hundreds of scientists as members,
including such familiar names as Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov.
