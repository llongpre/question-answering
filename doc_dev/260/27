   Long before ``What's your sign?'' replaced ``Come here often?''
as a lounge lizard's opening line, people sought their fortune in
the stars, planets and signs of the zodiac.
   Astrology assumes that the planets and stars, in some way,
predict or rule the lives of humans.
   Soothsayers searched the skies for omens in Babylon of the 18th
century B.C., but what is now known as astrology developed during
the Hellenistic period from the 3rd century B.C. to the 3rd century
A.D., according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.
   The World Book Encyclopedia says that astrological forecasts, or
horoscopes, are based on four elements: the Earth, the planets, the
zodiac _ the 12 signs that divide up the heavens and comprise an
astrological year _ and 12 ``houses,'' or elements of personality
associated with 12 imaginary divisions of the Earth's surface.
   Astrology assumes the Earth is the center of the solar system.
   ``Newtonian physics eradicated a belief in astrology among the
educated. The practice of the now pseudoscience continued among
nonintellectuals in the West, gradually losing contact with its
rich tradition and becoming more and more fraudulent,'' the
encyclopedia says.
   But popular interest in astrology grew after newspapers began
printing horoscopes in the 1930s.
   Nazi leader Adolf Hitler is known to have consulted astrologers,
as did his deputy, Rudolf Hess, who was captured on a bizarre peace
mission to England in 1941. Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, head of the
British Foreign Office in 1941, said that Hess was ``a simple,
stupid'' person whose astrologer had told him he would bring peace.
