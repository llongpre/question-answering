<HEAD>Video Version of Seer's Prediction Shakes Some Quake-Wary

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seven-year-old docudrama narrated by the
late Orson Welles has many California residents panicked that an
earthquake could reduce the city to rubble this week.
   The hot-selling 1981 videotape, ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,''
dramatically interprets a vague prediction in verse by the
16th-century seer Nostradamus as proof that a planetary alignment
will cause an earthquake to level Los Angeles sometime in May.
   To make matters worse, astrologers have further narrowed the
prediction to say the quake is most likely to strike sometime this
week, possibly between Sunday and Thursday.
   Callers have clogged earthquake hotlines. Psychologists report
an increase in patients' anxieties. Moving companies have even
transported a few desperate souls completely out of quake-prone
California.
   Although many experts have called the film bunk and said there
is no planetary alignment during May, anxiety seems to be gaining
momentum.
   ``The phones are ringing pretty steadily,'' said Brenda Searcy,
a nurse answering crisis line phones at Charter Hospital in Long
Beach Friday night.
   ``They're really panicking. Some of them are shaky and crying,''
Ms. Searcy said. ``I've had a lot of parents call and say their
children can't sleep at night because of the predictions.''
   Ms. Searcy said she tells the callers ``the way I feel. I don't
believe there is going to be an earthquake.''
   The Griffith Observatory also established a hotline after
workers found themselves fielding dozens of calls a day, said
program supervisor John E. Mosley.
   The most common question: ``When will the planets line up?''
   The answer: ``There are no planetary alignments whatsoever in
the month of May.'' And even if there were, such alignments have
never been found to correspond to an earthquake, Mosley said.
   ``People don't need to worry,'' said Stewart Robb, an Anaheim,
Calif., author who has studied Nostradamus' prophesies for 48 years
and has written five books on the French seer.
   ``It's not Nostradamus. It's an Orson Welles movie.... I would
go so far as to say that even if there were a big quake in May, it
would still not give credit to Nostradamus.''
   Nevertheless, Elaine Young, a Beverly Hills real estate agent,
said her company has gotten calls from those who want to lease
their homes for the month.
   ``We had some inquiries in April from people asking if they
could be moved at the end of the month,'' said office manager Linda
Chavez of Western Mayflower moving company in suburban Montebello.
``They indicated they wanted to move because they feared the coming
quake.''
   The fears have been a boon to some.
   Ron Burke, marketing manager for the Sparkletts drinking water
company, said sales of containers designed to be stored for
earthquakes increased 500 percent during April.
   And Extend-A-Life, a Pasadena disaster supply company reported a
10-fold increase in sales last week of such things as purified
water, survival cookie bars, first-aid kits and thermal blankets.
