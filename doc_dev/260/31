   Astrology and other strategies presumed to
predict the future are sharply denounced in the Bible, but the
ancient star-gazing system has evolved somewhat over the centuries.
   In its modern popular form, which reportedly has been used by
Nancy Reagan, it has little to do with religion, but scholars say
it still has ramifications that can turn it at odds with biblical
faith.
   ``A lot of people today regard it as kind of an innocent
pastime,'' says the Rev. Page Kelley, an Old Testament scholar of
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
   ``They don't put much store in it. I put it in the same category
as reading fortune cookies in a Chinese restaurant. But if people
really take it seriously as a scheme for ordering their lives, the
old objections become valid again.''
   To rely on it seriously, he added, ``borders more on stupidity
than sin.''
   In olden times, astrology was closely connected with idolatry,
used along with other devices both to determine courses of action
and ascertain the will of the gods.
   ``An abomination,'' Scripture calls it in Deutertonomy 18:9,
decreeing death by stoning for any Israelite, man or woman, who
``practices divination'' or uses soothsaying, augury, sorcery, a
charmer, medium, wizard or necromancer.
   Divination, linked to early astrology, used various clues to
determine the will of the gods, such as positions of celestial
bodies, tossed arrows to see how they fell, examining
configurations of oil on water or in a sheep's liver.
   The prophet Isaiah, assailing the evils of Babylon, says
scornfully:
   ``Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make
predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming
upon you. Surely they are like stubble. The fire will burn them
up.''
   Similar reproaches are scattered through Scripture, with
astrologers described as those ``who divide the heavens (into 12
signs of the zodiac), who gaze at the stars, who at the new moons
predict what shall befall...
   ``They wander about each in his own direction.''
   Rabbi David Sperling of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of
Religion said the strong condemnations of divination (early
astrology) were because of its ties to idolatry, contrary to
Judaism.
   ``We had the prophets and got the word of the Lord directly from
them,'' he said. ``We didn't have to rely on looking up at the
stars or inside animals to see what the gods had in store for us.
The prophets were much more reliable.
   ``What the Bible condemns is considering the stars as kind of
heavenly writing, telling you what God has in store for you.''
   He said astrology had evolved since ancient Bible times,
modified in later ancient Greek and Egyptian civilizations to be
seen not as revealing the gods, but charting planetary effects on
earthly behavior and moods.
   ``That's not quite what the Bible was dealing with,'' Sperling
said.
   Added Rabbi Eugene Borowitz, also of Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion: ``There's not a simple straight line from
the Bible to the kind of astrology Mrs. Reagan is involved in.''
   However, religious scholars said astrology, claiming the planets
partly control human affairs, tends to run counter to biblical
teaching of humanity's free will to choose good or evil.
   However, religious institutions rarely speak of astrology these
days, although it was often attacked in the early centuries of
Christianity and also in Islam.
   ``Fundamentalist theology very clearly condemns astrology,''
Kelley said, but he noted that contemporary churches generally have
shown little, if any, concern with it. He said the assumption seems
to be that few people take it seriously.
   ``If they do, that's another matter, and something to be
concerned about,'' he said.
   Sperling said that Jewish Scritpures (the Old Testament)
strongly condemn early tendencies of astrology (as a conduit of
gods), but rabbinical thought since then has varied on the subject.
   ``We're not of one mind,'' he said. ``Some are opposed to it,
while others think it's not such a terrible thing.''
   The prophet Daniel, who served in the court of the Babylonian
king Nebuchadnezzar, bewildered by his fortune-tellers and
astrologers, told him:
   ``No wise men, enchanters, magicians or astrologers can show to
the king the mystery which the king has asked, but there is a God
in heaven who reveals mysteries...''
   Daniel proceeded to tell Nebuchadnezzar his reign was ended.
``You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting.''
   Legend has it that the wise men who visited the Christ child
were Persian astrologers alerted to the event by planetary
conjunctions.
   Called variously a pre-science or pseudo-science, astrology
became ``scientifically untenable'' with the rise of modern
physics, says the Encyclopedia Britannica. But it still holds wide
attention in newspaper columns, other publications and commercial
establishments.
   The encyclopedia says: ``In short, modern Western astrology,
though of great interest sociologically and popularly, generally is
regarded as devoid of intellectual value.''
