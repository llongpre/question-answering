Howdy, New Year 
</P>
<P>
Jack and Martha Jamieson will be at it again this New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
For 36 years -- with one exception -- they have hosted a party every Dec. 31 in 
their North Hollywood house, and this year it's business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Jack will cook for the midnight buffet, and he and Martha -- who are both 
eightysomething -- have cooked up the skit, which is the highlight of these 
annual high jinks. To hear Martha tell it, most of these little performance 
pieces would never qualify for a G movie rating. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are doing 'Cinderella and the Madam,' set at the Cottontail Ranch 
in Nevada," she said, then paused. "You probably get the idea. My husband and I 
are both theatrical and musical, so we just sort of attracted friends who would 
like this sort of thing, and be willing to participate sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, when the first party was given, she invited mostly friends from the 
PTA at Toluca Lake School where her children attended, and friends from local 
musical groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There were probably 30 or 40 of them, and everything was pretty informal 
then," she said. Over the years, the skits and the buffet grew to outrageous 
proportions and the size of the crowd did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had to put my foot down," Martha said. "There were more than 100 people 
in our little house and that just wasn't good. One year I called the whole 
thing off so people would get out of the habit of coming here. But the next 
year we started up again with a smaller guest list." 
</P>
<P>
This year there will be about 60 guests and they will be invited to come at 10 
p.m., "so they won't be standing around with nothing to do half the night." 
</P>
<P>
At midnight, according to Martha, the guests are invited to sample Frank's 
buffet. Afterward, everyone will watch the show and then go home. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the skit written up, cast the parts, then do the music. Frank directs 
and I play the piano for the singing," Martha said. 
</P>
<P>
This New Year's Eve they will again be surrounded by friends, and their house 
will be alive with laughter and singing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of work, but it's fun," Martha said. "It's nice to think we started 
a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Be Prepared 
</P>
<P>
OK. Here's what's going to happen in the coming year -- straight from the 
planets to you -- and don't think it was easy getting this information. 
</P>
<P>
It seems this is the busiest time of year for psychics. They have a number of 
reasons for not wanting to give away predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Psychic Madam Joanne in Agoura said she wasn't interested in publicity or 
predicting about worldly things, she just does personal readings. 
</P>
<P>
Psychic astrologer Audrey in Canoga Park couldn't talk because she had company. 
</P>
<P>
The California Astrology Assn.'s answering service said no one would talk 
without an appointment, but offered to send a brochure. 
</P>
<P>
And the woman listed as the Royal Thai Star Path Astrologer in Studio City was 
on her way out the door but said not to worry too much about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Helene Woodman Cushman of Tarzana -- the San Fernando Valley's answer 
to Nancy Reagan's Joan Quigley -- called to fill us in. 
</P>
<P>
We've been having confrontations in the Middle East because Saturn and Mars are 
configuring badly up there, causing those of us down here to push and shove. 
Cushman, who takes both the Middle East situation and astrology seriously, said 
things would ease up by March. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, 1991 is going to be a much gentler year," she said. "The 
problems in the Middle East will not be resolved, but they will cool down 
considerably." 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, she said, the economy will level off. "We are not going to have a 
depression unless people lose their heads." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cushman, the planets say the stock market will continue to 
fluctuate, but the real estate market will revive. "By that I mean that the 
bottom is not going to fall out of the market," she said. "If you are looking 
for a bargain, you'd best jump in now." 
</P>
<P>
Cushman, who says she is directly descended from rebel minister Robert Cushman 
who arrived in this country on the Mayflower, said she figures out what is 
going to happen to the country partially by doing President Bush's charts. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is going to stay angry and feel aggressive about foreign policy for quite 
awhile," she said, "but after the first of the year there will be some real 
mellowing influences on him." She didn't say what was going to make the stock 
and real estate markets behave the way she said they would, but she sounded 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman, who once ran an astrology studio in Encino that attracted several 
Hollywood stars and at least one studio head, now runs her business from her 
house. But the prices haven't relaxed with the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
She charges $200 an hour to do a personal chart, and for businesses that want 
her to do financial projections the cost is "much, much more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoopster Heaven 
</P>
<P>
Toys International in the Glendale Galleria has something that is as much fun 
for the big boys as for little kids. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Jordan Jammer, sells for $59.95 and is made for guys who dream of 
running around in basketball shorts instead of doing their daily legal briefs. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Jammer is an adjustable pole with a red, white and blue net, a 
picture of Michael Jordan on the backboard and a plastic ball that can turn any 
desk-bound executive into a potential NBA star. 
</P>
<P>
Although the store personnel said no one has admitted buying the thing for her 
husband, Janet Marley of Burbank fessed right up. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure that if I get this for my husband's office, he'll be grateful enough 
to take the garbage out without being asked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tall Tails 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of bookstores in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope 
valleys, but An Affair With Books in Newhall has something extra. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo, a black cat of unknown age who came from the pound three years ago, is 
the companion of bookstore owner Deborah L. Harth. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo, said Harth, is serious about her job as the main distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo entertains the small fry while their parents shop. 
</P>
<P>
When she is not entertaining children, she walks up and down the aisles doing 
her impression of a watch cat, or she curls up in the front window in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
But when she hears children entering the shop, she's front and center, Harth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overheard 
</P>
<P>
"My New Year's resolution is to put an end to wars, stop the rape of the 
ecosystem, reverse the economic recession and stop eating M &amp; Ms."
