   Carroll Righter, astrologist to
movie stars and writer of a syndicated daily advice column for 166
newspapers around the world, has died. He was 88.
   Righter died Saturday at St. John's Medical Center, two days
after being admitted with cancer of the prostate, said hospital
spokeman Armen Markarian.
   A native of Philadelphia, Righter once studied to become a
lawyer, but charted a new course after a sports injury. He studied
his own astrological chart and saw he had ``physical protection in
the Southwest,'' he once said.
   Before moving West, Righter was introduced to astrologer
Evangeline Adams, who had counseled such people as Enrico Caruso
and Britain's King Edward VII.
   ``She told me I had the perfect chart for becoming an
astrologer,'' said Righter, who liked to be called the ``gregarious
Aquarius.''
   He began doing charts for Hollywood notables in 1938 and became
a columnist in 1950.
   Righter was mentioned in President Reagan's 1965 autobiography,
``Where's The Rest Of Me?'' and was one of several astrologers
consulted by Nancy Reagan, according to an article in today's
editions of The Washington Post.
   According to that article and a similar story in today's
editions of The Philadelphia Inquirer, a new book by former White
House chief of staff Donald T. Regan claims Mrs. Reagan turned to
astrologers to help determine the president's schedule.
   Righter claimed he warned Marlene Dietrich to avoid working on a
studio set one day because she might get hurt. His advice was not
heeded and Dietrich broke an ankle while reaching out to save a
falling child.
   Word of the accident and Righter's advice led other celebrities
to the astrologer's Hollywood doorstep, ensuring his fame.
   Among those who sought his advice were Arlene Dahl, Rhonda
Fleming, Jane Withers, Joan Fontaine and Grace Kelly.
   Good friend and fellow astrologer Thomas S. Pierson will take
over Righter's column, but said the aging master had completed his
predictions through October.
   ``He liked to work six months or a year ahead of time,'' said
Pierson, who is married to Miss Withers.
   Righter worked out of his Hollywood home, using an old manual
typewriter and thesaurus, and surrounded himself with photographs
of his famous clientele.
   Although he often forgot the names of people he had met, he
reportedly never forgot their birth signs and would address them as
``Miss Virgo'' or ``Mr. Aries,'' friends said.
   Righter also wrote several books, including ``Astrology and
You,'' the ``Astrological Guide to Health and Diet'' and the
``Astrological Guide to Marriage and Family Relations.''
   Pierson said Righter, who never married, predicted his own death.
   ``He knew it would be difficult because the sun had gone into
the sign of Taurus, a difficult period for an Aquarius,'' Pierson
said. ``He admitted he probably wouldn't get through.''
