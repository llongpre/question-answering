FT  10 JUL 92 / Observer: Trendy forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Ross Perot's victory is imminent and will be the flash-point of a
fundamental political restructuring that will spell the end of the familiar
two-party system and the beginning of a new system of independent parties.'
Says who? The latest issue of the Trends Journal of the Socio-Economic
Research Institute, that's who. And what is the Socio-Economic Research
Institute? A 'world leader in trend forecasting', according to the
institute's own packaging. The institute - based in New York state - charges
its corporate clients Dollars 25,000 for a 'trend-tracking project', which
defines a trend in social, economic or political terms.
Run by bearded, messianic-looking Gerald Celente, the institute claims an
impressive series of successful predictions, including the savings and loan
crisis and democracy for east Europe.
But it seems happiest when hedging its bets. Thus the very same issue, after
two pages explaining why Perot will win, considers four reasons why he might
lose: 'the national economy significantly rebounds'; 'Perot is found to have
been involved in a major scandal'; he 'selects a running mate with a narrow,
ideological perspective'; or 'he doesn't run an even moderately effective
campaign'. Oh Nostradamus, where art thou now?
