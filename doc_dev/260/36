<LEADPARA>  Chester Drake hadn't carried gas masks in his Santa Clara military surplus
store since the Vietnam war. But on a whim last spring, he bought some. Good
thing.;    "Everyone is buying gas masks the last few days," said Drake, owner
of Able Supply.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "A guy just left the store with six of them. And I just got a phone call
from a company wanting 19.";    So far, he has sold 75 of 100 masks in stock.;
   The same soaring demand was evident at six other Silicon Valley Army-Navy
supply stores and several expected to be sold out Friday.;    Owners say they
can't restock because the military has bought up all available masks.;   
Aside from gas masks, the other hot-selling military surplus item in the past
two days: American flags.;     LAWYERS AGAINST WAR TO URGE PEACE IN AD;
Sparked by two Bay Area attorneys, lawyers nationwide who are opposed to the
Persian Gulf war say they'll urge a halt to the conflict in a full-page ad
next week in a prominent American newspaper.;    Its text urges President Bush
and the U.S. Congress to seek peace, and notes the war will continue to cause
death, ill feelings between Arabs, Jews and Americans, and is a waste of money
that would be better spent on domestic needs.;    "We're not dictating how
peace should be achieved. Our point is the war is wasteful of lives and peace
should be sought," said Palo Alto attorney Cynthia Cannady, one of the
founders of "Lawyers for Peace in the Persian Gulf." The other founder is
lawyer Eva Paterson of San Francisco.;    The newspaper has not yet been
selected, but the fledgling group has received support from attorneys in
California, Oregon, Washington and Washington, D.C., Cannady said.;     SAN
JOSE POLICE UNIT; ON 24-HOUR STANDBY;  San Jose police intelligence officers
have been on 24-hour alert since the first bombs fell on Baghdad Wednesday.;  
 "A sergeant and an officer will be on standby to respond to incidents
associated with acts of terrorism," said unit commander Lt. Allen McCulloch.; 
  The special standby unit will continue indefinitely because experts believe
retaliation might come long after hostilities cease, McCulloch said.;    
BOOKS ON MIDDLE EAST; CURRENT HOT SELLERS; South Bay stores say books on the
Persian Gulf and its personalities -- both fact and fiction -- are hot items.;
   "People are asking for anything to do with the Middle East," said Louise
Kraft, assistant manager at Walden Books in the Oakridge Mall.;    Some of the
hot sellers, store managers say, have been: "Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in
the Gulf," by Judith Miller; "Republic of Fear, The Inside Story of Saddam's
Iraq," by Samir Al-Khalil; and "Operation Desert Shield, The First 90 Days,"
by Eric Micheletti.;    On the fiction side, stores report brisk sales of "The
Predictions of Nostradamus" and Danielle Yergin's "The Prize," which was
described as the Middle East's epic quest for money, oil and power.  </TEXT>
