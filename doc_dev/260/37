   Astrologer Joan Quigley says she didn't intend
to write a book about her influence in Ronald Reagan's presidency _
until she read what Nancy Reagan said about it.
   ``It reads like fiction and much of it is evasive,'' she wrote
in her new book about Nancy's book. ``What she has left out would
fill a book.''
   ``No political decision was ever made based on it,'' Mrs. Reagan
said in ``My Turn'' of Mrs. Quigley's readings of the moon, the sun
and the planets.
   ``Through Nancy, I had a direct line to the president,'' said
Ms. Quigley in her memoirs, ``What Does Joan Say?''
   Said Donald Regan, the fired presidential aide who first
revealed in his memoirs, ``For the Record,'' that Mrs. Reagan was
consulting an astrologer: ``Virtually every major move and decision
the Reagans made during my time as White House chief of staff was
cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew up
horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable
alignment for the enterprise.''
   Here are excepts from the three books on the question of Ms.
Quigley's role:

   ``Nancy Reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant
powers of this woman, who had predicted that `something' bad was
going to happen to the president shortly before he was wounded in
an assassination attempt in 1981. ...''
   ``There was no choice but to humor the first lady in this
matter. But the president's schedule is the single most potent tool
in the White House, because it determines what the most powerful
man in the world is going to do and when he is going to do it. By
humoring Mrs. Reagan we gave her this tool _ or more accurately,
gave it to an unknown woman in San Francisco who believed that the
Zodiac controls events and human behavior and that she could read
the secrets of the future in the movements of the planets.''

   NANCY REAGAN:

   ``My relationship with Joan Quigley began as a crutch, one of
several ways I tried to alleviate my anxiety about Ronnie (after
the March 30, 1981, attempt on his life). Within a year or two, it
had become a habit, something I relied on a little less but didn't
see the need to change. ...
   ``I want to state one thing again, and unequivocally: Joan's
recommendations had nothing to do with policy or politics _ ever.
Her advice was confined to timing _ to Ronnie's schedule, and to
what days were good or bad, especially with regard to his
out-of-town trips.''

   ``Through Nancy, I had a direct line to the president. That the
astrological work I did for both Reagans affected the top level of
government is now a matter of history. ...
   ``I was responsible for timing all press conferences, most
speeches, the State of the Union addresses, the takeoffs and
landings of Air Force One. I picked the time of Ronald Reagan's
debate with (Jimmy) Carter and the two debates with Walter Mondale;
all extended trips abroad as well as the shorter trips and one-day
excursions, the announcement that Reagan would run for a second
term, briefings for all the summits except Moscow, although I
selected the time to begin the Moscow trip.
   ``I timed congressional arm-twisting, the second inaugural oath
of office, the announcement of Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court
nomination. ...''
   ```Ronnie's `Evil Empire' attitude has to go before he can meet
with Mikhail Gorbachev at Geneva,' I told her. `Gorbachev's
Aquarian planet is in such harmony with Ronnie's, you'll see,' I
said. `They'll share a vision. What's more, when Ronnie and
Gorbachev meet, they'll get along famously, better than you can
imagine if _ and this is a very big if _ Ronnie goes to Geneva with
the proper attitude.'
   ```I know you are right,' Nancy said. `But it won't be easy to
change Ronnie. First, I'll have to persuade him. You know as well
as I do how he feels about Russian leaders. I'll have to make him
realize what you say about Gorbachev is true.'''
