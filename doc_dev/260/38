MONEY AND THE MARKETS by Graham Bates and Jane Chrzanowska Bowles
HarperCollins Pounds 9.99, 200 pages
For all the high-speed electronic gadgetry, public disclosure requirements
and deep analysis, stock markets remain sadly imperfect markets. Why?
Because although they anticipate the future, they cannot predict it.
What a joy, then, to discover that the missing ingredient has been hiding
under our noses all this time. It is called financial astrology.
Do not let those derivatives get you down. All that the prudent investor,
hedger or speculator needs to know is contained in the 'ephemeris', the
daily record of the positions of sun, moon and planets.
Now, the ephemeris may look a little daunting at first. No matter. You can
master the basic theology of cycles, orbits, nodes, transits and trines by
plodding through Bates and Bowles's book; then spend six months as a student
at Bates's Astrological Association, then buy a computer, programme it, and
Bingo] You are an extra-planetary insider.
Well, almost. The science of astrology is still somewhat undeveloped, warn
Bates and Bowles. Furthermore, 'there is no universal astrological formula
that can be mechanically applied to suit all occasions.' Later they say:
'There are so many astrological factors that affect the market . . . even
the strongest cycles are overwhelmed by other factors.'
Oh. Perhaps that is why the Black Monday stock market crash occurred 12 days
after the ominous eclipse on October 7, 1987. Perhaps that is why, for each
event, there seem to be only one or two of the astrological brotherhood who
get it right in advance.
But lack of precision does not explain all the inconsistencies. For
instance, B and B say that fellow-astrologer Daniel Pallant foresaw the 1987
crash 'well in advance.' If you look at Pallant's prognostications in the
Weekend FT you will discover that as late as June, 1987, he was predicting a
bull market at least until November. No mention of a crash.
One suspects a little retrospective tidying up is going on here. It turns
out that every event does indeed have a planetary explanation - after the
event. And even the most superstitious punter may find it difficult to
swallow the idea that stock markets and the companies quoted on them -
indeed, whole countries - have astrological birth charts just like us from
which their financial fortunes can be plotted.
Determining the time of birth of a country - you need it to monitor the
underlying economic cycles - 'is not always a straightforward affair',
concede B and B. But company horoscopes are easily dated from the day of
registration. (What you do about name changes, mergers, and so on it is not
clear.)
Yet it is obvious that Polly Peck's troubles stemmed from 'its particular
sensitivity to eclipses and a crushing sequence of Pluto transits.' Virgin
Atlantic's natal conjunction of Mercury and the moon clearly augured well
for a company in the airline business. Mercury had winged feet, remember?
The fundamental principle to grasp is that free enterprise, represented by
Uranus, gets its resources (Venus) from the investing public (the Moon).
There is a superstitious streak in all of us, so it is not impossible that
financial astrologers are being secretly consulted - as they claim - by some
heavyweight stock market institutions.
Yet one sniffs a logical loop, a Russellian paradox, here. If financial
astrology worked, then the markets would discount every significant
planetary conjunction before it occurred. But then what influence would the
planets have on the day? In other words, if it works it doesn't work, and if
it doesn't it does.
One final puzzle. Bates describes himself as a former investment fund
manager in the City. Why, then, does he not keep his insights to himself and
make himself a fortune? Answer: one sure way to wax fat is to sell a million
books about slimming; one way to make money is to tell other people that
only you know how to do it.
Perhaps the science of astrology will one day get its Isaac Newton, as Bates
and Bowles hope (though they seem not to know that Newton was a keen
astrologer). Until then, however, you would be best advised to look up your
stockbroker, not Uranus.
