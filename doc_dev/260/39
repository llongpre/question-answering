THE PENETRATING voice was unmistakeable, the glint in the eyes undimmed.
There was no escaping from the coffee lounge as he advanced. It was Fringe
Freddie, doubtless promoting yet another esoteric investment theme. Was it
my imagination, I wondered, or did the gold bracelet seem a little clunkier
this time.
Occasionally, I make the error of attending an investment seminar which is,
shall I say, just outside the mainstream. It is not, you understand, that I
really believe in Japanese candlestick charts, Professor Wheeler's 1000-year
drought rhythm, or even the triple conjunction of the Kondratieff, Juglar
and Kuznets cycles; but surely it does no harm to keep an open mind.
The last time I ran into Freddie at one of these gatherings, he was heavily
into the prophecies of Nostradamus. The International Harry Shultz Letter
had admitted that its forecast of a disastrous Californian earthquake for
May 8 1992 had been based upon a wrong interpretation of the mystic, but the
event definitely was scheduled for May 8 1993 instead.
This week, pointing out rudely that San Francisco seemed still to be there,
I challenged Freddie over falling for yet another failed prediction; but, as
usual, he had forgotten all about his past mistakes. He had been infected
once more by the oldest fever of all, the gold bug.
They were trying desperately to keep a lid on the gold price, he said, but
it was hopeless. 'They,' I gathered, were the central banks, such as the one
in Holland which dumped 400 tonnes at the end of last year at a price which
certainly does not look too clever now the gold price is up 12 per cent from
its low. Clearly, I was not going to escape without hearing about a global
conspiracy.
Did I not know this was the most fiscally irresponsible period in history?
ranted Freddie. The Americans were running a deficit of 5 per cent of GDP
and, despite the smokescreen of tax proposals, their national debt could
reach 80 per cent of GDP soon. Already, net interest payments were at 15 per
cent of federal spending and would soon spiral right out of control.
Europe was just as bad, and the ERM finally was collapsing. Germany's public
sector deficit was 8 per cent of GPD, the UK's ditto and even France,
previously financially prudent, was heading the same way, having budgeted
for a deficit of 4.5 per cent last Monday. The Japanese had been leant-on by
the Americans to launch their own state spending binge.
Just a minute, I protested: surely this could all be financed properly
through the bond markets. With a recession on, there was no shortage of
finance. Long-term interest rates had actually been falling around the
world, at least until a few weeks ago. Of course, governments would need to
raise taxes and cut their spending when the recovery began . . .
Freddie began positively jingling with excitement (the reason, I noticed,
being that he was actually wearing two gold bracelets). Britain's Newbury
by-election showed just what happened to governments that raised taxes, he
said. As for long-term interest rates, had I really failed totally to notice
what the Americans were doing? They were cutting their sales of long bonds
and shunting even more short-term debt into the banking system.
By keeping deposit rates very low, the Federal Reserve was inducing the
banks to hold vast quantities of short-term bonds on which they could make
an easy profit - much more easily than by lending to real businesses that
generated actual economic wealth. But a monumental re-financing problem was
piling up for a few years out. Moreover, the low money market rates were
undermining the dollar and helping to fuel inflation, which had started to
go up again.
It was true, I admitted, that the performance of the dollar had been
disappointing this year. Meanwhile, the yen was looking wildly over-priced
on fundamentals, sterling was dogged by a massive balance of payments
problem, and the European continental currencies were threatened by tumbling
German short-term interest rates. It was hard to see where to put your
money.
Precisely, said Freddie. We should get out of paper currencies altogether
and into gold, which the politicians could not debauch. Even the equity
markets were looking dangerous. The new record net inflow of Dollars 28.5bn
into US equity mutual funds in the first quarter of 1993 was a classic
contrarian signal. In the UK, there was a corresponding surge of Pounds
1.8bn into unit trusts, beating even the Pounds 1.7bn for the first quarter
of 1987. Professionals were getting out and amateurs were getting in.
I attempted to regain control of the conversation. It was true, I said, that
the fall in real interest rates had cut the cost of owning gold. Also,
surging demand from China had helped world bullion sales to jump nearly 25
per cent in the first quarter, year-on-year. But that was at very low price
levels and, even at this week's prices, you were showing a total loss since
1980 of 57 per cent in dollars and 80 per cent in yen. Take into account the
opportunity cost of interest foregone, plus the actual cost of storage and
insurance, and gold would have lost you more than 90 per cent of your
wealth.
Freddie was jingling again. I talked, he said, like a blinkered bank
manager, the sort who would be one of the very last holders of US Treasury
bonds, too busy looking at the juicy yield spread to notice the coming
default (just like at Olympia &amp; York). Governments were desperate to
suppress the gold price bubble because it would focus attention on rickety
banking systems and unsustainable fiscal deficits. But we were approaching
the point of no return.
With relief, I saw that a session on Fibonacci ratios was about to begin.
But later, funnily enough, I felt quite glad I had run into Freddie. I might
have heard the story from somebody else and taken it seriously.
