   Californians who fear a devastating
earthquake in the nation's second largest city based on the
purported prediction of 16th century seer Nostradamus are falling
prey to superstition and nonsense, state emergency officials say.
   The prediction ``is pure, unadulterated bunk,'' Bill Medigovich,
director of the California Office of Emergency Services, said
Monday by telephone from Sacramento.
   ``We don't want people to plan (for quakes) out of fear of
predictions like this,'' he said. ``We want them to do it on a
rational basis.''
   But hundreds of people called earthquake information hotlines,
some left the region and children expressed fear because of a vague
prediction by Nostradmus and a 1981 movie, now sold on videotape,
called ``The Man Who Could See Tomorrow.''
   The film, narrated by ``War of the Worlds'' prankster Orson
Welles, claimed the French seer said the area would be wrecked by a
huge quake this month. Some astrologers have said a big quake is
most likely this week.
   Students at California State University, San Bernardino,
satirized the paranoia Monday with an ``End of the World Party'' at
the student union pub, complete with ``free death cake'' and
disaster movies, said Cecilia McCarron of the school's student life
office.
   ``Predictions based on clairvoyance, headaches, animal behavior,
astrology and other bogus methods have no basis in science and
should be categorically disregarded,'' said a statement released
Monday by state Seismic Safety Commission executive director L.
Thomas Tobin.
   The Office of Emergency Services says a major, devastating quake
is more than 50 percent likely in Southern California in the next
25 years. But if one occurs this week or month, ``as far as the
Nostradamus prediction, it will be coincidental,'' said Jim Davis,
chairman of the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council.
   Nevertheless, hundreds who fear the prediction swamped phone
lines at Griffith Observatory, the American Red Cross and the
California Institute of Technology.
   ``Most of these people aren't kooks. They're genuinely
frightened, telling me they can't sleep, they're having nightmares
and they don't know what to do,'' said Caltech spokesman Robert
Finn.
   Psychologist Robert Butterworth said worried callers swamped the
hotline at Charter Hospital of Long Beach. He partially blamed
revelations in a book by former White House chief of staff Donald
Regan that First Lady Nancy Reagan consulted astrologers.
   Elaine Young, a Beverly Hills real estate broker, said she
leased a dozen homes for people who left town for the month, and
leased another 15 to wealthy New York residents who came to
California for the month because someone started a rumor a big
quake would hit the East Coast.
   Finn said he tells callers Nostradamus never predicted a quake,
only a hailstorm, and that the alleged prediction refers only to
``the New City,'' not Los Angeles.
   ``Even if you believe in Nostradamus, the prediction is totally
bogus,'' Finn said. ``The prediction came out of that 1981 movie
and they translated it very liberally. That movie also predicted
Teddy Kennedy would be elected president in 1984.''
