   A top politician pays big money to a
mystic for his election victory.
   An astrologist prescribes gems to members of Parliament for
their success in the polls. A wise man who walks around naked
blesses his candidates by patting their heads with his feet.
   Swamis, stargazers, gurus and palm readers are raking it in
during the Indian election as dozens of unsure candidates seek that
special something to catapult them to victory.
   ``Jupiter is rising,'' said noted astrologer R.N. Sharma as the
voting began earlier this week. ``That means a close fight.''
   After the election was called last month, astrologers were
consulted on the best time to file nomination papers. The respected
Times of India newspaper reported that the release of the governing
Congress Party manifesto was delayed because of astral
considerations.
   Some columnists have claimed that the voting, which began
Wednesday, was also scheduled with the heavens in mind.
   ``We live in unsure times,'' says political commentator Bhabani
Sen Gupta. ``All of us, especially politicians, are worried about
the future. A little occult often sets the mind at ease.''
   Stargazing and palm reading in India date back to before the
time of Christ. Two sages, Parashara and Bhrigu, are credited with
writing texts explaining the cosmos.
   The idea of reincarnation, one of the foundations of the Hindu
philosophy, plays a central role in their writings. The sages also
borrowed liberally from the Assyrians, who flourished in southwest
Asia around the 7th century B.C. and are believed to have invented
what has become the modern-day horoscope.
   Astrology has played its role in modern Indian history.
   On Aug. 15, 1947, India became independent of British rule. But
it happened at midnight, not an auspicious hour. Fable has it that
Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, the famed British naval officer who
supervised the transfer of power, was angered that none of his
advisers was familiar with astrology.
   Over the last 25 years, astrology and other soothsaying arts
have grown in popularity, especially among India's middle and upper
classes.
   Commentator Sen Gupta reports that few of his friends and
political colleagues are without an astrologer or a palm reader.
Others visit gurus and holy men. He himself journeys to a seer in
Calcutta every year.
   ``Development creates rootlessness,'' he explains. ``In
traditional societies everything was so very certain. You consulted
an astrologer only for acute situations _ marriage or death. Now,
nobody knows what will happen.''
   The result has been fame and fortune for many a pundit, a
Sanskrit word for soothsayer. Astrologers, palmists and gurus have
set up shop in top hotels and charge thousands of rupees _ hundreds
of dollars _ for a session.
   Harvest time for India's people of the occult occurs when the
nation votes. India's lively state-run press is filled with
predictions and politicians seek out the savants for advice on how
to achieve victory.
   Lately, Sharma has been recommending gems.
   ``They all need power stones,'' Sharma says of the 40 members of
Parliament he claims as his clients. ``Yellow and blue sapphires,
those are selling fast.''
   He says the sapphires work by harnessing the power of Saturn and
Jupiter, planets which play ``a critical role in politics.''
   Other politicians have commissioned yogis to pray for their
victory. The Indian Express reported that Home Minister Buta Singh
paid 5 million rupees (about $300,000) for a tantric prayer
session, or pooja.
   Even Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has reportedly visited Devra
Baba, a sadhu, or Hindu holy man. The Baba, as he is known, is a
nudist and blesses his followers by touching their heads with the
balls of his feet.
   Ben Gupta sees the trend as dangerous for India.
   ``All this black magic stuff encourages resignation and
acceptance of one's fate,'' he says. ``We don't need that here. We
are poor so we must struggle.''
   Sharma says he believes the more astrology the better. The only
change he recommends is in India's money.
   ``We have no mention of God on our bills,'' he says, fingering a
100 rupee note. ``That is why America is so great. Every bill says,
`In God We Trust.'''
