   Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Bon Jovi?
   One person believed 1990 would bring wedding bells for tattooed
New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi and the former first lady: Irene
Hughes, one of 10 top psychics assembled by the National Enquirer
in December 1989 to peer into the year ahead.
   A visit to the Delphic optometrist appears in order, judging
from the sights Irene and her fellow seers saw coming in the 365
days now ending.
   ``In the shocker marriage of the year, Jackie Onassis will tie
the knot with young rock star Jon Bon Jovi,'' opined Hughes,
described by the Enquirer as ``the Chicago seer who has helped
oolve numerous crimes.''
   Hughes also incorrectly predicted that a barroom brawl over
another man's wife would lead to Bryant Gumbel's departure from the
``Today'' show. She offered no similar prognostication for Joe
Garagiola, who has both joined and left the morning news show in
the past 12 months, or the rumored-to-be-gone Deborah Norville.
   Not to be outdone, New York psychic John Monti - who reportedly
foresaw the 1981 shooting of President Reagan - offered this take
on the Kennedy clan for 1990.
   ``Ted Kennedy will suffer a mental breakdown and become
convinced he is his dead brother John. His ex-wife Joan will rush
to his side to nurse him back to health, rekindling their lost
love,'' Monti warned.
   Ted, of course, is well and remains a thorn in George Bush's
side.
   For all his problems, the president did dodge one bullet -
actually, something much, much bigger than a bullet - in the past
year.
   ``A meteorite will plow into the White House Rose Garden,''
predicted Maria Graciette, who eerily forecast the Manson family
murders. ``The First Family will be put in peril by levels of
radiation emitted by it.''
   Such myopic looks into the future were not limited to the pages
of the Enquirer. Both the well-known (syndicated astrologist Jeanne
Dixon) and the obscure (cable TV's psychic window-washer, Morris
Fonte) were a little off base this year.
   ``For President Bush, 1990 will be a year of vindication. His
policies at home and abroad will pay off big,'' Dixon wrote.
   Instead, Bush was locked in a bitter budget battle with Congress
and dispatched U.S. troops to the Middle East - two moves that led
to his approval rating hitting its lowest ebb since his arrival at
the White House.
   Fonte's flubs were a bit more enjoyable. ``Madonna marries a
prominent rocker around November,'' he said. ``Giuliani's
gubernatorial bid will rattle Mario Cuomo's skeletons.''
   End of the year update: Madonna, single. Rudolph Giuliani, never
a gubernatorial candidate. Cuomo, quietly elected to a third term.
   In addition to the Jackie Bon Jovi prediction, the Enquirer went
out on a limb with this celebrity romance: talk-show-host love
between Arsenio Hall and Oprah Winfrey. (Don't tell Steadman,
Oprah's oft-mentioned beau.)
   The Arsenio-Oprah union was to be professional, not just
personal, said Clarisa Bernhardt, who specializes in divining
earthquakes: ``(They) will team up onscreen as a singing-and-comedy
duo, remaking one of the old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby `Road' movies.''
   ``The Road to Syndication''? Doesn't matter; didn't happen.
Chill out, Bob; stop turning over in that grave, Bing.
   As for the rest of the decade, well, don't worry if you never
see the 21st century. The Enquirer team of 10 also offered these
prophecies for the next nine years:
   For space reasons, the ones already proven wrong - i.e, Mike
Tyson heavyweight champ until 1998, Liz Taylor marrying the late
Malcolm Forbes - will be deleted. But the future still holds ...
   -Telly Savalas will be hospitalized when he sucks on a poisoned
lollypop given to him by a crazed fan!
   -Pee Wee Herman will bulk up his body through weightlifting,
grow a Clark Gable-style moustache - and emerge as a movie leading
man with serious performances that will have critics raving!
   -Madonna (her again!) will take fertility drugs - and give birth
to a set of quintuplets!
