Astrology is not a science. It has not held up under any controlled experiment 
or statistical analysis. Nevertheless, more people believe in astrology now 
than at any time since the Renaissance, wrote Roger Culver in "The Gemini 
Syndrome," a 1979 book debunking astrology. 
</P>
<P>
Culver and other non-believers say astrology's popularity derives from people's 
feeling that much of their life is out of their control and that they have a 
need to believe in some mysterious, higher force. Astrology connects their 
lives with the cosmos, making them part of a divine plan. It offers guidance, 
hope and perhaps a blueprint to the future pertaining to finances and 
relationships. And it absolves them of personal responsibility; instead, the 
blame is placed on the stars, a past life or the psychic spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Astrology began 5,000 years ago when man was huddled by the campfire, afraid of 
the night. Any measure of control was comforting. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental thesis of astrology is that the pull of the sun, moon, planets 
and stars somehow influence our lives based on the date, time and place of our 
birth. Personal and professional decisions, say proponents of the ancient "soft 
science," made in tandem with planetary aspects, can decrease negative trends 
and capitalize on positive ones. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientific experiments have tested the validity of astrology and the 
results are always that it contradicts reality. Although individuals born under 
certain signs are supposed to be more likely to have personalities best suited 
to be, say, politicians or scientists, a thorough study of the listings in 
"American Men of Science" or "Who's Who in American Politics" shows that the 
distribution of birthdays is random, covering all signs. Similar tests were 
conducted to see if couples whose signs were "compatible" divorced less often 
than "incompatible" couples, but they seem to do it just as often. 
</P>
<P>
Another study conducted with assistance from the National Council for Geocosmic 
Research showed astrologers blow a prediction two times out of three. 
</P>
<P>
Still people believe in astrology. 
</P>
<P>
There's Nancy Reagan, Abraham Lincoln and . . . sometimes me. 
</P>
<P>
Was it possible that my past had caught up with me? A recent session with 
karmic astrologer E.J. McVay had me wondering. She believes that the past and 
present are of equal importance in predicting trends and cycles that shape our 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
The astrologer, who holds a steadfast belief in reincarnation, contends that 
knowledge of past events in this life and past lives can lend insights to help 
us achieve professional success and personal serenity. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between conventional astrology and karmic astrology is the 
concept that much of what we did in a past life is repeated in this one. To 
grow, we must flow with the lessons from those past lives and learn necessary 
lessons to make the present life better. We should be striving to be our 
highest and best self. Karmic astrology can help us accomplish that goal," says 
McVay, who counsels clients at the Center for Health &amp; Well-Being, a 
holistic health clinic in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Many of McVay's clients are single people who are looking for love and for ways 
to make it last. 
</P>
<P>
McVay dismisses magazine and newspaper astrology columns as too general. "All 
people of the same sign do not experience the same events, feelings, 
frustrations and successes any more than all people from Texas or New York are 
the same because they speak with a similar accent. Obviously each person from 
one place or the other has their own unique personality. It's the same with 
astrology." 
</P>
<P>
Determining a person's past life helps her be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
During our one-hour consultation, in which she held in her hand a computer 
printout of my sign based on the time, day and year I was born, I only revealed 
one other thing about myself: my occupation. 
</P>
<P>
She glanced at my chart and looked puzzled. Childhood aspects in my chart, she 
said, indicated a flurry of parental activity and confusion. Were my parents 
living? 
</P>
<P>
I hesitated in telling her the truth. I was adopted when I was 3 and my 
adoptive parents died when I was a teen-ager. As for my biological parents, my 
father is deceased and my mother's whereabouts are unknown. E.J. seemed to have 
me there. 
</P>
<P>
She was also right in describing my personality, and she correctly told me of a 
recent artistic project I'm working on and the short-distance move associated 
with it. I breathed a sigh of relief when she predicted that it would be a 
success and that that would lead to greater success. 
</P>
<P>
That was great news, but I was curious about other matters. "Tell me about 
love," I begged. She forecasted that I would be seriously involved by August 
and married by 1991 and that I would travel across country because of my 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
More good news. I hope either prediction comes to pass. Travel and romance have 
eluded me lately. 
</P>
<P>
Karmic astrology can explain, says McVay, why a person tends to run up against 
the same or similar obstacles repeatedly throughout life. But can it explain 
why people keep choosing the wrong mates, or some people have multiple 
marriages or relationships? 
</P>
<P>
"An individual's karma is shaped by their previous lives; their soul did not 
learn all the lessons it needed to learn to excel to a higher plane and 
experience a harmonious relationship," McVay says. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike conventional astrologers, many of whom believe that individuals with 
conflicting charts cannot coexist, McVay believes that her role is not to judge 
but rather to assist those people in bringing about harmony within their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not for me to tell people whom they should be with. That is their 
decision. If they are attracted to each other, if they have chosen to be 
together, there is a reason, a lesson they must learn," McVay says. "My job is 
to enlighten them, helping them create the best relationship possible while 
they are together learning those lessons." 
</P>
<P>
Although I was pleased with my reading, I have reservations about the 
reincarnation and karma concept. Doesn't a belief in reincarnation and karma 
excuse people for poor behavior? If you know that your soul has another chance, 
isn't there a tendency for people to think that they can do anything they want 
because these are necessary steps to reaching a higher plane? 
</P>
<P>
McVay disagrees. "It doesn't excuse anything because each individual reaps what 
he sows. If a person chooses the wrong mate or breaks the law, he or she will 
pay for it sooner or later on this physical plane, and later in the next life. 
The universe isn't out to deal you trouble. It only deals trouble for trouble. 
If your choice is peace, you're going to have peace and if your choice is 
trouble, you're going to have trouble."
