   A newly devised mathematical formula will let
researchers predict if a region is likely to be rocked by a strong
earthquake within three years, Soviet and U.S. scientists reported
today.
   The formula is based on changes in seismic activity before
powerful quakes in California and Nevada. The scientists used the
formula in hindsight to successfully ``predict'' 16 of 20 powerful
quakes in the Soviet Union, Central Asia, Romania, Belgium and the
U.S. Northeast.
   The technique hasn't been used to predict future quakes and
won't allow scientists to predict that a quake will occur in a
precise time and place.
   But it will allow them to make ``intermediate-term'' predictions
that a strong earthquake is likely within three years somewhere in
a broad region, said Leon Knopoff, a co-author of the study
published in the British journal Nature.
   ``This is a step toward improving the prediction of large
earthquakes in time and space,'' Knopoff, a geophysics professor at
the University of California, Los Angeles, said Wednesday.
   Scientists now are pretty much limited to making long-range
forecasts. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey predicted in
July that within 30 years, a major or great quake measuring 7 to 8
or more on the Richter scale is 60 percent likely on the San
Andreas Fault in Southern California and 50 percent likely on the
the Hayward or San Andreas faults in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Knopoff conducted the study with Vladimir Keilis-Borok and I.M.
Rotwain, of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of the
Physics of the Earth, and California Institute of Technology
geophysicist-geologist Clarence Allen, the former chairman of the
National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council.
   If the new method is proven valid, it will help government
officials and private citizens because ``even a vague description
of the area that could be at risk and a refinement in the time
scale is valuable,'' said Mike Guerin, spokesman for California's
Office of Emergency Services.
   Knowing a big quake is likely within three years in a certain
region ``sets a deadline in which they need to accomplish certain
preparations and plans,'' he added.
   But such a vague prediction would make it ``very difficult to do
anything more than is already being done in California in terms of
preparedness,'' countered Randall Updike, executive secretary of
the quake prediction council and deputy chief of the Geological
Survey's Office of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Engineering in
Reston, Va.
   The council reviewed the method during a meeting in June.
Members decided that while it was a step forward and should be
studied further, it would be premature to use it immediately to
predict three-year periods in which large quakes were likely, said
James Davis, a council member and chairman of the California
Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council.
   The Soviet-American team devised a mathematical formula to
identify ``times of increased probability'' _ roughly three-year
periods in which certain patterns of seismic activity are likely to
culminate in a strong earthquake.
   They developed the formula by studying seismic patterns that
preceded 14 earthquakes of 6.4 magnitude or more in California and
Nevada between 1938 and 1984.
   The scientists then tested the formula by applying it to 20
quakes in five other regions of the world since 1963. The formula
found that 16 of those quakes were preceded by ``times of increased
probability'' for large temblors.
   The patterns incorporated into the formula included above- or
below-normal numbers of smaller jolts, the rate at which such
quakes increased or decreased, the size of those smaller quakes,
the number of aftershocks following such quakes and whether such
quakes in one area were followed immediately by quakes in a distant
area.
