<HEAD>Political Stars Wrong For Reagan-Thatcher Meeting, Astrologer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   One of Britain's leading astrologers says the
stars are wrong for this week's post-summit meeting in London
between President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   Reagan, an Aquarian, and Mrs. Thatcher, a Libran, ``enjoy a
marvelous cerebral relationship'' with all the right ingredients to
get things done, but this isn't the week to do them, said Russell
Grant, president emeritus of the British Astrological Psychic
Society.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said Sunday
it commissioned the forecast from Grant.
   Grant said Reagan's meeting with Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday and
Friday, with Mercury starting to go backwards through the planetary
system, comes during a ``very unstable period.''
   The president flies to London after his meeting in Moscow with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``If he has got an astrologer advising him, I would have steered
clear of this period more than any other time in the year,'' Grant
said.
   ``You could reach an agreement today, and in a month's time
people could renege on it,'' he said. ``What is going on at the
moment is so volatile and so unpredictable that you really cannot
stand by what is said.''
   But the astrologer said the intuitive powers of Nancy Reagan, a
shrewd Cancerian, could be ``invaluable'' during the president's
London visit.
   He said Queen Elizabeth II, a Taurus who is having a tea for the
Reagans at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, would also be a positive
influence.
   Mrs. Reagan's interest in astrology made headlines around the
world this month when former White House Chief of Staff Donald
Regan published a book alleging that the first lady's astrological
advice affected the president's schedule.
   The president has denied this.
