<HEAD>Starstruck British Press Has Predictable Field Day With Reagan
Revelation</HEAD>

   The revelation that President Reagan and his wife
consult astrologers was greeted by the British press Wednesday with
the sort of relish that even the sorriest soothsayer could have
predicted.
   ``White House Watchers Wild about Nancy the `Stargazer,'''
blared the headline in The Daily Telegraph, which went on to report
that ``Washington was abuzz with claims ... that Nancy really
believes what the stars foretell.''
   Newspapers in Italy, West Germany and Sweden gave relatively
straightforward coverage to the president's denial Tuesday that his
policies or decisions were influenced by astrology.
   But their British counterparts could not resist poking fun at
the Reagans or the former administration officials who have
revealed juicy White House gossip.
   ``There is no wrath like that of a former Reagan aide,
apparently,'' said the Independent newspaper. ``Or, to put it
another way, former Reagan aides will do anything to get their
memoirs on the best-seller list.''
   Donald T. Regan, former White House chief of staff, reportedly
asserts in a forthcoming book that Nancy Reagan regularly consulted
astrologers in shaping the president's schedule.
   The tabloid Daily Mirror devoted almost an entire inside page to
the hubbub. It also listed _ under the banner headline ``Star
Struck!'' _ the famous people who purportedly sought insight from
astrologers.
   Among them were Albert Einstein, Queen Elizabeth I and Napoleon
Bonaparte.
   Einstein once wrote that ``astrology was a science in itself
(that) ... taught me many things,'' according to Daily Mirror
columnist Louise Montgomery.
   Elizabeth I, the 16th-century English monarch, rarely acted
without the advice of astrologer John Dee, and French emperor
Napoleon commissioned at least two astrological charts and ``placed
his trust in the movement of the stars,'' she added.
   A sober headline in the Independent said ``Reagan Takes a Dim
View of Star-Gazing Tales'' while the tabloid Daily Express' banner
headline proclaimed, ``Ronnie and Nancy's Star-Struck White House.''
   In Sweden, Aftonbladet bannered the story saying ``Reagan
Governed by the Stars'' while the liberal Expressen had a large
picture of the presidential couple and a headline reading ``Nancy,
What's the Stars Predicting for Today?''
