"The Big One," NBC's fictional account of a major earthquake in the Los Angeles 
area, hadn't yet hit the airwaves when the phones started ringing at Great 
Shakes Inc. in Brea a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which packages earthquake survival kits, wasn't getting inquiries 
from local folks worried about a calamity. The pickup in business came from 
folks living half a continent away. 
</P>
<P>
Great Shakes is among a number of Orange County companies who report a spurt in 
business due to a surge in earthquake awareness along the Mississippi River, 
from Chicago to Memphis, where residents have been warned by a scientist to 
prepare for a major temblor in early December. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't very many businesses back there that specialize in earthquake 
survival," said Tommy Rainey, vice president of Emergency Lifeline, a Santa Ana 
firm that sells emergency survival kits and conducts earthquake preparedness 
seminars. "When people in Missouri think of quakes, they think of Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Climatologist Iben Browning, 72, of New Mexico said in March that an unusual 
alignment of planets on Dec. 2 and 3 would create a 50% chance of a major quake 
then on the New Madrid fault. 
</P>
<P>
In response, several school districts and cities in the fault zone, which runs 
from Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill., have made tentative plans to dismiss 
students and pull together disaster and public safety workers during the 
critical two-day period. 
</P>
<P>
And as December draws near, newspapers and radio and television news programs 
in the region have focused attention on Browning's warning and reminded 
residents of the great New Madrid quakes in the winter of 1811-12. 
</P>
<P>
A series of quakes, including four that scientists say would have measured 
between 8 and 8.7 on the Richter scale had that measuring system existed at the 
time, rocked the then sparsely settled region that winter. No other earthquake 
in the United States has been rated as high as 8.7. The San Francisco quake of 
1905 has been rated an 8.3-magnitude temblor, and the Bay Area quake of Oct. 
17, 1989, was recorded at 7.1 on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
The New Madrid quakes -- which were felt as far east as Washington -- destroyed 
scores of cabins and farm buildings, killed dozens of people and reportedly 
reversed the flow of the Mississippi River for a brief time. 
</P>
<P>
As people living along the New Madrid fault have been reminded of the nearly 
2-century-old devastation, the fear in the heartland has meant better business 
for certain companies in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency Lifeline, started in 1985 by Kathy Gannon -- a native of Missouri -- 
has seized the opportunity to plug into the region's new quake awareness by 
launching a program of safety seminars in Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee and 
Kentucky. The firm also has mailed 10,000 catalogues to quake-zone addresses, 
hoping to spur mail-order sales of its survival kits. 
</P>
<P>
Great Shakes sales manager Marvin Marquis said his firm also has mailed 
catalogues -- more than 5,000 of them -- to schools and businesses in the New 
Madrid fault zone and has been receiving inquiries about its survival kits from 
people in that region for more than a month now. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has 300 employees and operates several branch offices around 
the country, offers a variety of retail and custom-designed survival kits that 
include food and water, first-aid and sanitation supplies, survival equipment 
and, at the upper end of the price scale, emergency shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Retail kits, the type generally ordered by individuals or small businesses, 
cost $12.95 to $3,995, Marquis said. Custom kits can run "many thousands more," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Emergency Lifeline, Great Shakes also conducts safety seminars and just 
completed a series in Chicago and Memphis that was geared to earthquake 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at several civil and structural engineering firms in Orange County 
said they haven't experienced any recent increase in business, either from the 
Midwest or from locals responding to NBC's two-part earthquake movie, which 
ended Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
But that, they said, is because they deal with corporate and government clients 
and not with individuals, who are more likely to be upset and spurred to action 
by a movie like "The Big One." 
</P>
<P>
Shawna Sandoval, a receptionist and secretary at American First Aid Supply in 
Brea -- another of Orange County's survival-kit marketers, said Monday that she 
saw an increase in phone orders after the first part of the TV movie aired 
Sunday night and that she expects more calls today "after the part runs that 
shows all the destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval, who handles the company's phone orders, said she also has seen a 
definite increase in orders and inquiries from the Midwest in recent weeks.
