   A TV movie that shows an earthquake leveling
Los Angeles will make people aware of the potential for disaster
without dashing hopes for survival, the film's producer says.
   Criticism that ``The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake''
will unnecessarily frighten people is ``hogwash,'' said Robert M.
Sertner, co-executive producer of the mini-series slated for
broadcast Sunday and Monday nights on NBC.
   ``Our goal is to wake people up,'' especially in other regions
of the nation that could be hit by strong quakes, Sertner said
Friday.
   Scientists and emergency officials have said the film
exaggerates the death and devastation a big quake would cause in
Los Angeles. They fear that it may discourage viewers from
adequately preparing for seismic disaster.
   ``It makes me crazy,'' Sertner said of such criticism. ``I'm not
pretending this is a documentary, but it's raising people's
consciousness, and that's what we wanted to do. So it's hogwash''
to contend the mini-series will discourage emergency preparations.
   ``I wanted to let people know preparedness makes a difference,''
he said, noting that the film shows the importance of learning how
to shut off gas lines and stockpile emergency supplies.
   Station KNBC-TV in Los Angeles arranged for local Red Cross
chapters to operate earthquake preparedness hotlines.
   ``It's possible some people may have a very emotional reaction''
to the mini-series, said Sylvia Stewart, spokeswoman for the Red
Cross' Orange County chapter. ``Small children may be frightened.''
   To provide earthquake preparedness brochures to movie viewers,
the American Red Cross already is operating a 24-hour, nationwide
toll-free hotline. The number is (800) 842-2200.
   California Office of Emergency Services officials were upset to
learn the movie depicts the agency trying to stifle an earthquake
prediction to protect a wealthy developer.
   ``I absolutely feel bad'' about that, but it was done to
dramatize the dilemma facing officials who must decide whether to
warn the public based on uncertain earthquake forecasts, Sertner
said.
