   Winston Churchill's official biographer says the
prime minister used an astrologer in a political ploy to get the
United States to enter World War II by predicting Nazi Germany
would lose the war.
   Oxford University historian Martin Gilbert said the plan in
mid-1941, when Britain was desperate to end American neutrality,
didn't work.
   ``Churchill never used an astrologer personally but he once used
one politically,'' Gilbert said Tuesday. The historian has just
finished the eighth and final volume of Churchill's biography.
   In the summer of 1941, Gilbert said, ``a convention of
astrologers in the United States dominated by pro-German groups had
predicted the victory of Hitler in the war, which was clearly a
good reason for America staying out of it.''
   ``Learning of this, Churchill at once dispatched to the States
the astrologer Louis De Wohl who proved from the same constellation
of stars and moons and whatever else astrologers use that Hitler
would, in fact, lose,'' he said.
   Gilbert said this brought ``much discomfort to those who claimed
otherwise'' but didn't bring the United States into the war. That
happened after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The White House acknowledged Tuesday that Nancy Reagan consults
astrological forecasts to help plan President Reagan's activities.
The disclosure came after former chief of staff Donald T. Regan
reportedly wrote in his forthcoming book that Mrs. Reagan consulted
astrologers to determine the timing of presidential speeches and
announcements.
