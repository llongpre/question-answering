   Astronomers say a vague prediction by the
16th-century astrologer Nostradamus has caused unfounded fear that
an alignment of planets will trigger an earthquake that will
destroy Los Angeles in May.
   ``There is no alignment of planets in May, and even if there
were, it wouldn't have anything to do with earthquakes,'' Edwin
Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory, said Monday.
   But rumors of an impending earthquake, spurred by writings of
the French astrologer and the movie ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,''
which is being sold on videocassette, prompted more than 100
fearful people to call the observatory in recent weeks, Krupp said.
   ``We an tell by the phone calls that many people are getting
needlessly afraid of the possibility of an earthquake,'' he said,
calling the quake predictions ``bunk.''
   Astronomer John Mosley, the observatory's program supervisor,
wrote recently: ``There are 11,000 earthquakes each year in the Los
Angeles area strong enough to be recorded. There may be a
significant earthquake in May 1988, here or elsewhere ... but if
there is, it will have nothing to do with the planets' positions.''
   Mosley said followers of Nostradamus, who lived from 1503 to
1566, have claimed he predicted such events as the Russian
Revolution, the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
   But Nostradamus' predictions, written in rhyme, ``are
exceptionally vague, and in general it is only after the fact that
a link can be made between his rhymed prediction and an historical
event,'' Mosley said.
   He said ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow'' claimed Nostradamus wrote
that an alignment of Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus and Mars will
cause a major earthquake in May in Los Angeles.
   ``The prophecy is quoted incorrectly in the movie,'' Mosley
said. ``Nostradamus predicts a severe hailstorm, not an earthquake.
... There is no clue that tells us where this hailstorm will
occur.''
   Mosley said: ``The last time the planets were supposed to align
and trigger mass destruction in Los Angeles was in 1982, the year
of the `Jupiter Effect,''' a book that claims the planets' tidal
influence causes quakes.
   ``Untold millions did not die in 1982 and there's no reason to
think that anything will happen in 1988,'' he said. Even if the
planets were aligned, ``their gravitational effect would be
completely negligible ... and they would have no effect on our
planet's weather, tides or earthquakes,'' Mosley added.
