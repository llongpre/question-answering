   A projection of a major earthquake in the
Midwest in early December is as about as reliable as a random
guess, a group of scientists said today.
   ``Such a projection, especially at the predicted 50-50 chance
level, implies a level of detailed knowledge ... that simply does
not exist for the New Madrid or any other fault zone in the
world,'' the group said in its report.
   The group released its findings, prepared for the National
Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, today at a news
conference in St. Louis.
   The 11 scientists were brought together from universities and
governmental agencies to evaluate the scientific validity of Iben
Browning's projection of a 50 percent chance of a big quake hitting
the New Madrid Fault on or about Dec. 3.
   Browning, a climatologist based in Sandia Park, N.M, bases his
prediction on the cyclical forces of tides and gravity. He has said
that for 48 hours before and after Dec. 3, tidal forces will be
particularly strong.
   Earlier this week, Browning said that conditions will again be
ripe for a major quake in the region on New Year's Eve.
   Browning told Cape Girardeau television station KFVS that tidal
forces on that date will not be as high as on Dec. 3, ``but they
will still be dangerously high.''
   In 1811-1812, a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the
Richter scale struck the New Madrid region, causing the Mississippi
River to appear to flow backward and forming Reelfoot Lake in
Tennessee. The tremors rang church bells in Washington, D.C., more
than 850 miles away.
   Browning's Dec. 3 claim has been widely reported, causing public
anxiety throughout the region. At least nine school districts in
three states have canceled classes, insurance agents have been
swamped with requests for earthquake insurance and attendance at
earthquake preparedness meetings has been high.
   The New Madrid fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., across
southeastern Missouri to southern Illinois and produces hundreds of
small quakes every year, most hardly felt. It's named for the
Missouri Bootheel town of New Madrid, about 140 miles south of St.
Louis.
   In today's report, the scientists' agreed with other findings
that ``the long-term potential for a large earthquake does, indeed,
exist for New Madrid.''
   But it said that ``Browning's correlations of earthquake
activity with danger periods at times of highs in tidal forces does
no better at predicting earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6.5
than does random guessing.''
   The scientific group also said it found no evidence to support
the claim that Browning had predicted the Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake
in northern California.
   ``We can only infer that successes claimed before that time were
retrospective - that he found after the fact that certain
earthquakes occurred during times of his `danger periods.'''
   A quake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale hit the New Madrid
region Sept. 26. The quake, the second strongest in the region this
century, caused no injuries and no significant damage, but it added
significantly to what has been called the ``earthquake hysteria.''
