   Five years before White House stargazing
became front-page news, a Georgia congressman claimed that Ronald
Reagan consulted astrologers before selecting his running mate, a
TV station reported Friday.
   WEAR broadcast a videotape of a speech given here April 30,
1983, by Democratic Rep. Larry McDonald, describing how George Bush
was selected as the vice presidential nominee at the 1980
Republican convention.
   ``Mr. Reagan and his wife both are very avid followers and
believers'' in astrology, McDonald told a meeting of the
conservative John Birch Society. ``It's an important part of their
personal philosophy.''
   ``During the Republican convention ... candidate Reagan had some
of the various seers of the stars, those who draw up the horoscope
menus, and they had a number of interviews with a whole group of
them as to what they saw in the stars for the Republican
convention,'' McDonald said.
   ``And guess what these seers of the horoscope had to say? That
Mr. Reagan would be the nominee and that the Republicans could win
the White House only if Mr. Reagan selected George Bush as his
running mate.''
   Reagan selected Bush only days after the meeting with the
astrologers, said McDonald, who was killed five months after the
speech in the crash of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which was shot
down by the Soviets over the Sea of Japan.
   The Reagans' interest in astrology was detailed last week in a
book by former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan.
