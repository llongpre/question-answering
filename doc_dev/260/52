   The tale of the starstruck Reagans rolled across
the front pages of Europe this week, drawing jokes and jibes along
the way, and even surfaced on the floor of Britain's House of
Commons.
   ``I come under Libra, which is a very balanced sign,'' declared
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when asked by a lighthearted
fellow Conservative lawmaker whether she planned to move an
astrologer into her No. 10 Downing St. residence.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 62, was born Oct. 13, under Libra, the sign of
the scales.
   The allegations by former White House chief of staff Donald
Regan about the role the zodiac played in the Reagan White House
are giving Europe's cartoonists, punsters and humorists a lot of
fun.
   ``Advice on Star Wars from the Stars Themselves,'' headlined
West Germany's Frankfurt Rundschau newspaper.
   ``The star-spangled planner,'' sniped London's Independent.
   Le Monde, France's most prestigious paper, ran a cartoon asking
an astrologer: ``How come you didn't predict Regan's book?''
   Regan's book was preceeded by several other books and articles
by former close associates of the president, most notably a recent
book by ex-presidential spokesman Larry Speakes.
   In his book, Speakes said he made up quotes for the president
without checking them with Reagan.
   The issue of kiss-and-tell _ or ``spit-and-tell'' as London's
Guardian put it _ doesn't interest many Europeans. Many governments
bind employees to lifetime oaths of confidence that make such
revelations difficult.
   One family that has suffered the scourge is Britain's royals.
The family also imposes oaths of confidence, and in 1983 it
resorted to the unprecedented tactic of suing a former Buckingham
Palace kitchen worker and the tabloid Sun, which was serializing
his memoirs. The Sun settled out of court and scrapped the series.
   ``I understand what Nancy Reagan was doing ... my wife does the
same thing, but taking an opinion from an astrologer is one thing
and basing decision-making on him or her is quite another,'' said a
Greek parliamentarian, who declined to be named.
   Greek fortuneteller Fortoula, a 50-year veteran medium, claims
to have been consulted in her basement apartment near the
Parliament in Athens by ``several prime ministers and I don't know
how many cabinet ministers'' from Greece, Egypt and Lebanon during
her career.
   ``Why not? Politicians in government need the advice of all
sorts of people,'' she said.
   West Germany's Bild newspaper quoted Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher as saying he reads the horoscopes daily but
doesn't believe in them.
   ``It is interesting to learn what I supposedly face day by
day,'' he said.
   Defense Minister Manfred Woerner was quoted as saying:
``Astrology is very interesting, but personally I would rather
place my fate in the hands of our loving God.''
   Dutch astrologer Jacques Chandu said he frequently advises
politicians on party matters, but declined to name names. He said
Mrs. Reagan had given his trade a boost.
   But S. Schouten of Utrecht University's parapsychology
department said he doubted astrology played a role in Dutch
politics.
   Switzerland's conservative newspaper, Neue Zuercher Zeitung,
predicted the astrology story would haunt the Reagans the way Jimmy
Carter suffered from his story about confronting a giant killer
rabbit.
   London's left-of-center Guardian said it was glad ``there is one
date that not even Mrs. Reagan's astrologers can postpone. The date
of the next presidential election.''
