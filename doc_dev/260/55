   Experts preached calm after an
earthquake that rattled people in six states, saying it isn't
necessarily a precursor to the catastrophic Big One predicted for
December.
   No major damage or injuries were reported from Wednesday
morning's quake or a second, smaller one that night. The quakes,
felt in Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Indiana, were in the New Madrid Fault zone.
   For months, people along the seismic zone have been worrying
about scientist Iben Browning's contention that there's a 50-50
chance for a major quake there on or about Dec. 3. Many scientists
have dismissed the prediction.
   Doug Wiens, professor of earth and planetary sciences at
Washington University in St. Louis, said there is no extra cause
for alarm.
   ``I'm worried about this sort of hysterical tone that's come
out, where people are planning to take trips, close schools, close
businesses on December 3, because it is completely ridiculous,'' he
said.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake Wednesday
measured 4.6 on the Richter scale. The second was believed to be an
aftershock and measured a preliminary 3.0, said David Stewart,
director of the Center for Earthquake Studies in Cape Girardeau.
   Although the quakes were off the New Madrid Fault proper, they
fell within the fault zone.
   Each year, about 200 measurable quakes occur in the zone,
Stewart said, but only about three a year pack enough power to be
felt. In fact, before Wednesday, three were felt this year: a 2.8
quake on Jan. 9, a 3.1 on Aug. 7, and a 3.4 on Aug. 29.
   Said Stewart: ``We expect them every now and then. When they
happen, they normally mean nothing.''
   Although the quake was relatively minor, it was the second
largest in the New Madrid Fault zone this century, said Stewart.
The largest - 5.0 - hit in 1976 and was centered near Marked Tree,
Ark.
   A quake of magnitude 7.1 - which was mentioned in Browning's
predictions - would be about 3,000 times more powerful than a quake
of 4.6.
   Did Wednesday's shaker make residents more nervous?
   ``Of course it does, are you kidding?'' said Carolyn Tinsley,
who owns a video rental store in Scott City, about 10 miles from
the quake's epicenter of New Hamburg. ``I'd like to move if I
could.''
   In New Hamburg, a town of about 200 in the Missouri Bootheel,
students at the Kelso C-7 Elementary School felt the quake.
   ``It sounded like people moving their desks up on the second
floor,'' said eighth-grader John Koepp. ``I wasn't scared.''
   Moments before the temblor, teacher Donna Robert had been asking
a student whether her mother, who experienced a major earthquake in
Alaska, might be interested in coming to class to talk about
earthquakes.
   ``It was like the voice of God speaking. I couldn't believe
it,'' she said.
   In Dover, Tenn., Flossie Rouse said it felt like ``somebody was
taking the mattress and shaking it. Dishes and things in my china
cabinet were rattling like crazy. The whole house was shaking.''
   The New Madrid Fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., across
southeastern Missouri to southern Illinois. It's named for the town
of New Madrid, about 40 miles south of New Hamburg and 140 miles
southeast of St. Louis.
   In 1811-12, a series of quakes estimated up to 8 on the Richter
scale struck the New Madrid region, causing the Mississippi River
to appear to flow backward and ringing church bells in Washington,
D.C., more than 850 miles away.
   Browning, a climatologist and business consultant in New Mexico,
said there was a 50-50 chance of an earthquake measuring 7.0 or
greater on or about Dec. 3. Browning was unavailable for comment
Wednesday, his secretary said.
   Browning said tidal forces coming to a head on or about Dec. 3
could unleash various kinds of geological violence around the
globe.
   Earthquake experts have for the most part dismissed his theory.
Wiens said experts have found no link between tidal forces and
earthquakes. In fact, tidal forces were low Wednesday.
   But school has been canceled for Dec. 3 in at least one district
in Arkansas. Vacations by city employees in Carbondale, Ill., have
been prohibited that week. Earthquake preparedness seminars have
been playing to packed crowds.
   The Mexico City earthquake in 1985 measured 8.1. Last October's
earthquake in San Francisco measured 7.1.
