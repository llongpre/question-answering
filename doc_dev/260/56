FT  14 DEC 94 / Observer: Santa's opt-out clause
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another convert to the musings of Nostradamus? Yesterday the British
Chambers of Commerce set some kind of precedent by reacting to today's
inflation figures 24 hours ahead of time.
A fax to the FT at 11.30 am on Tuesday cited Richard Brown, the deputy
director-general, as welcoming the news of 'the unchanged underlying
inflation rate'.
Had there been a leak? Alas, an hour later, the BCC confessed that the early
fax was due to 'temporary Christmas insanity'. It seems that, in its
confusion, the Chamber had thought the inflation figures would be published
yesterday. On ringing the Central Statistical Office's statsline, it gleaned
the news about underlying inflation, but did not realise that the CSO was
referring to October rather than November.
Still, if underlying inflation is unchanged when today's figures are
announced, expect Brown to be headhunted by Old Moore's Almanack.
