<DESCRIPT>  EARTHQUAKE; FORECAST; SAN-JOSE; MAN  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Scientists and state officials may not believe a word of it, but self-styled
earthquake seer Jack Coles says his latest prediction -- a Loma Prieta-sized
temblor somewhere in the Bay Area on Sept. 11 -- is right on schedule.;

<HEADLINE>  UNSHAKEN BY DELAY, S.J. SEER INSISTS THE BIG QUAKE
IS NEAR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Earlier this week, the San Jose stereo store employee said he received what
he's been waiting for in the way of confirmation -- a radio signal similar to
ones he claims to have noted preceding quakes for the last dozen years. It
came on Labor Day, just as he said it would, a sign he said meant a quake
would hit sometime between Tuesday and Friday (it didn't) or on next
Wednesday.;   "I have trouble telling them apart," Coles said Monday. "If
there's no seismic activity in the next 24 to 96 hours, then it's a nine-day
signal.";   It's also a signal that Jack Coles seems to be alone in hearing.; 
 State officials -- inundated with calls from worried residents, mostly in
Southern California -- have taken the unusual step of publicly disavowing
Coles' claims. The U.S. Geological Survey said it found nothing to support the
unassuming 37-year-old high-school graduate's theories.;   Coles gained wide
publicity -- in large part through the pages of the Mercury News -- after he
appeared to predict a series of quakes in the Pacific Ocean off Northern
California and Oregon last month.;   But scientists dismiss those forecasts --
and Coles' other reported accurate predictions -- as chance.  </TEXT>
