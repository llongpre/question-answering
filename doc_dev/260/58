   British and Soviet media poked fun at President
Reagan's reported belief in astrology, but newspapers in other
countries quoted him as saying the stars had played no role in his
policies.
   ``White House Watchers Wild about Nancy (Reagan) the
`Stargazer,''' blared the headline in Wednesday's Daily Telegraph,
which reported that ``Washington was abuzz with claims ... Nancy
really believes what the stars foretell.''
   Newspapers in Italy, West Germany and Sweden gave relatively
straightforward coverage to the president's denial Tuesday that his
decisions and progarms were influenced by astrology.
   British and Soviet media also made fun of former Reagan
administration officials who have revealed juicy White House gossip.
   ``There is no wrath like that of a former Reagan aide,
apparently,'' said Britain's Independent newspaper. ``Or, to put it
another way, former Reagan aides will do anything to get their
memoirs on the best-seller list.''
   Donald T. Regan, former White House chief of staff, reportedly
asserts in a forthcoming book that Mrs. Reagan regularly consulted
astrologers in shaping the president's schedule.
   The tabloid Daily Mirror devoted almost an entire inside page to
the hubbub. It also listed _ under the banner headline ``Star
Struck!'' _ the famous people who purportedly sought insight from
astrologers.
   Among them were Albert Einstein, Queen Elizabeth I and Napoleon
Bonaparte.
   Einstein once wrote that ``astrology was a science in itself
(that) ... taught me many things,'' according to Daily Mirror
columnist Louise Montgomery.
   Elizabeth I, the 16th-century English monarch, rarely acted
without the advice of astrologer John Dee, and French emperor
Napoleon commissioned at least two astrological charts and ``placed
his trust in the movement of the stars,'' she added.
   A sober headline in the Independent said ``Reagan Takes a Dim
View of Star-Gazing Tales'' while the tabloid Daily Express' banner
headline proclaimed, ``Ronnie and Nancy's Star-Struck White House.''
   In Sweden, Aftonbladet bannered the story saying ``Reagan
Governed by the Stars'' while the liberal Expressen had a large
picture of the presidential couple and a headline reading ``Nancy,
What's the Stars Predicting for Today?''
   Tass wondering in a dispatch what the stars are telling Reagan.
   ``It is difficult to say what the May night sky, studded with
stars, predicted to the president, but it hardly predicted that he
would have to speak about the role of astrology in the politics of
the USA,'' the official Soviet news agency said.
   Tass characterized as evasive Reagan's denial that the stars
influence policy decisions. ``Now more Americans are asking
themselves: May it be true that the president determines the
country's political course with the help of the stars?''
