   Nostradamus' disaster warning date has
passed, but now Californians are all shaken up about a series of
earthquakes and an ominous official warning of worse jolts ahead.
   ``A lot of people are spooked,'' says Paul Preston, who runs an
earthquake preparedness business in Marin County.
   Northern California residents began buying up survival supplies
and swamping quake experts with phone calls after the state issued
a rare official warning about an increased chance for a severe
earthquake this week south of San Jose, where a quake rocked the
region Monday.
   The temblor, estimated as high as 5.7 on the Richter scale of
ground motion, shifted tectonic plates along the San Andreas Fault
and has been followed by a surprising lack of aftershocks,
seismologist Robert Uhrhammer said Wednesday.
   Uhrhammer, of the University of California Seismographic
Stations at Berkeley, said the area in the Santa Cruz Mountains is
40 times more likely than normal to be hit by another temblor of at
least the same magnitude by Sunday because the quake put additional
stress on the San Andreas.
   The American Red Cross on Wednesday put its Northern California
chapters on alert through Tuesday. The action came a day after the
state Office of Emergency Services suggested that Santa Clara,
Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito counties notify local officials
of the increased earthquake risk.
   ``We certainly don't want to panic people, but if there is an
increased chance _ even a little one _ we have to let people
know,'' said Tom Mullins, an agency spokesman in Sacramento.
   ``If we had this information and didn't go out with it and a
quake occurred and someone was injured or even worse, I think we
would bear responsibility,'' he said. ``And from what I've heard,
people are not panicking.''
   Some Californians had been on edge over predictions by 16th
century astrologer Nostradamus that a disaster would destroy the
``new city'' during a planetary alignment in May 1988.
   Many interpreted this as meaning Los Angeles would be leveled by
an earthquake, and thousands of worried residents called
planetariums, stocked up on supplies and planned out-of-state
summer vacations.
   In addition, about 1,000 or more Cambodian refugees fled town,
apparently heeding dire predictions from astrologers and
self-proclaimed psychics, but there was no planetary alignment and
no major temblor.
   This week's official advisory was only the fourth such warning
ever made.
   ``We don't want to send people running and screaming into the
streets, because the increased likelihood is low,'' said Rick
Lester, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist. ``But it is a
responsible step to take to alert people.''
   All the earthquake talk has boosted business at a San Jose
hardware store, where custoers have been ``buying batteries like
you wouldn't believe,'' assistant manager Woody Smith said. Bottled
water sales also have been brisk.
   The months since last October's big earthquake in the Southern
California community of Whittier have been the busiest time ever
for Preston's company, Earthquake Preparedness Consultants.
   The company is one of several in the area that conduct home
inspections and give advice on how to reduce potential earthquake
damage. It also sells a device that automatically shuts off natural
gas pipes in the event of seismic activity.
   ``I have had a lot of calls in the last couple of days, but it
really started with Whittier and continued this year with the
Nostradamus prediction and the other quakes,'' Preston said.
   ``Most people hadn't given it any thought. Now almost everybody
in Southern California has felt a good jolt, and people in Northern
California are getting worried, too.''
