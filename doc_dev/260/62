   Joan Quigley, a San Francisco heiress who has
authored books on astrology, said Sunday she is the ``friend'' who
advised first lady Nancy Reagan on matters such as safe times for
the president to travel.
   ``I can't deny that she has consulted me,'' Ms. Quigley said in
a telephone interview from her Nob Hill home. ``I am very
uncomfortable, however, with the situation because normally I never
discuss the identity of my clients, and I never discuss their
affairs.''
   ``I am a serious, scientific astrologer and I am really not one
of these clowns, and I really don't like this circus atmosphere,''
said Ms. Quigley, who has been practicing astrology since 1960 and
has written three books on the subject.
   Ms. Quigley's revelation followed reports on the book, ``For the
Record; From Wall Street to Washington,'' in which Donald T. Regan
writes that ``virtually every major move and decision the Reagans
made during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in
advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes to
make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the
enterprise.''
   Regan confessed that he never learned the identity of the woman,
whom he said Mrs. Reagan referred to only as ``my friend in San
Francisco.''
   Time magazine, which published excerpts from the book, first
identified the woman.
   Ms. Quigley, who frequently appears on the Merv Griffin
television show, said she was first introduced to Mrs. Reagan by
Griffin.
   ``I really didn't get actively involved until the first
campaign'' for president by Reagan, she told The Associated Press.
She said she did astrological work for the campaign, but declined
to give details.
   ``After the assassination attempt, Mrs. Reagan asked me if she
could consult me because she was worried about the president's
safety, as well she might be,'' Ms. Quigley said.
   She said Mrs. Reagan telephoned her at ``various times,''
sometimes on Saturday afternoons from Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland, as Regan reported.
   ``I certainly never controlled the president's actions,'' she
said. ``Mrs. Reagan would want to know if something was a safe time
and I certainly advised her on that.''
   Ms. Quigley said her advice is based on the exact time and place
of a person's birth.
   In a separate interview with Time, she said, ``An astrologer
just picks the best possible time to do something that someone else
has already planned to do. It is like being in the ocean. You
should go with the waves, not against them.''
