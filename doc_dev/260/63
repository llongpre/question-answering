   For these economists, the picture always is
bright - out of this world, you might say. That's because when it
comes to business, astro-economists turn to the stars.
   They look at the rise of the moon, gravitational forces of Venus
and Jupiter, and Earth's tidal flows and weather patterns to
forecast the future of economic trends ranging from unemployment to
gold prices.
   Spacey?
   Not to these high rollers, er, astro-economists.
   This weekend about 150 of them are in Chicago for the Third
Annual World Conference on Astro-Economics.
   Say what?
   ``When most people hear about astro-economics, they go,
`What?''' Robert Hand, creator of a computer program overlaying
star charts with stock market fluctuations, said Friday.
   ``I think that there is a great deal of incredulity,'' he said,
``but the proof is in the pudding in that people who use it make
money.''
   Among the lecture topics at the conference, for which each
attendee paid $170: ``Geocosmic and Rhythmic Cycles in Today's
Precious Metals Markets,'' ``Astrological Technical Analysis,'' and
``Hot Stocks for the Coming Year.''
   Over the coming months, Hand said, he foresees a bottoming out
in the stock market and recession-like trends.
   Critics might argue it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
predict such events.
   Take, for example, Robert Eisner, a William R. Kenan professor
of economics at Northwestern University in Evanston. He calls
astro-economics ``garbage, unequivocally.''
   ``Unless you have some theory about how stars relate to economic
activity - and I'm not aware of any good one - it's
inconceivable,'' Eisner said.
   ``Of course, the stars will do no worse, on average will do
about the same, and sometimes will do better on Wall Street than
any speculating would.''
   Still, Hand insists that to predict the economic future within
80 percent to 90 percent certainty proves the practice works.
   Grace Morris, an astrologer and psychoanalyst who co-sponsored
the weekend conference in Chicago, defended the pseudoscience.
   She said skeptics should note astrology predicted Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait - precipitated by a lunar eclipse, a
stress-causing event on any planet.
   Morris said she uses astrology to advise businesses on the
proper timing for startups, new product introductions and corporate
takeovers.
   ``Virgo companies like Texaco and Coca-Cola will do very well in
late 1991,'' she said. ``Jupiter will move into Virgo after
September of 1991, and Jupiter symbolizes the expansion of
business.''
   Astrology has been a subject of fascination for years, studied
by U.S. presidents beginning with George Washington and Thomas
Jefferson and more recently by Nancy Reagan for setting her
husband's schedule.
   So, it's only natural that it take on financial applications,
said Elizabeth Gauerke, who analyzes weather cycles to predict
events.
   ``In the history of the world, money and the planets have always
been tied up,'' she said. ``The market is not predictable, but what
planets do is. It's a simple formula that works for a lot of
people.''
