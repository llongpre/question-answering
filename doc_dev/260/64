   Just when quake-frazzled San Franciscans
were recovering their equilibrium, the collapse of a construction
crane and other accidents are rattling them all over again.
   Some are crying. Some are laughing so they won't cry.
   Quake jokes have been big on the comedy circuit since the Oct.
17 shaker, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale. Now crane jokes
are starting to make the rounds after the 16-story plunge of a
giant crane last Tuesday that killed five people and injured 21.
   It's hard to feel safe anywhere after a week when, in addition
to the crane accident, a bus and train collided, killing two, and a
street caved in from a broken water main.
   Oddball theories abound on the cause of the troubles.
Astrologers claim the calamities were preordained, based on the
city's ``birth date'' of Jan. 30, 1847, when the pueblo of Yerba
Buena became San Francisco.
   ``San Francisco is moving into a period of bad luck and
disasters, being injured in our tenderest places, while being in a
position of negative publicity and changes in our image,'' said
astrologer Jayj Jacobs.
   The string of bad breaks continued Friday when Mayor Art Agnos
was hit by a big wave and slammed into a beach in Hawaii. Agnos,
who was on the island of Maui to speak about earthquake
preparedness and crisis management, broke his collarbone and will
need to wear a brace for two to three weeks, mayor's spokesman
Scott Shafer said.
   The mayor scoffs at suggestions the city is cursed, but worries
that a disaster a day will keep tourists away.
   The recent accidents, though spectacular, did not result in a
larger number of deaths or injuries than occur daily in many big
cities. But San Francisco, for all its glamour and international
presence, is a relatively small place _ the population is about
one-tenth that of New York _ and events are magnified.
   Crisis hotlines are so busy callers often are put on hold.
Mental health clinics are packed with stressed-out patients, some
afraid to go into tall buildings, cross bridges or ride
double-decker freeways.
   Calls to the suicide prevention and related hotlines for people
with problems such as drugs or marriage troubles were up 30 percent
in the first couple of weeks after the quake, reaching about 260 a
day.
   Though the number of calls has since eased off, the numbers
don't tell the whole story because callers in the past week have
tended to be more upset on average and each takes longer to help,
said Eve Meyer, executive director of San Francisco Suicide
Prevention.
   ``The calls we've been getting this week are more intense ...,''
said Meyer. ``The events this week triggered memories of the quake.
And the fact that this is happening during the start of the holiday
stress season is adding to the anxiety. We've burned out a lot of
volunteers in the last month.''
   If comedy is tragedy plus time, as Alan Alda observes in Woody
Allen's latest film, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' then San
Francisco is getting funnier every day.
   ``Humor is a defense mechanism,'' says comedian Mark Pitta.
``When the quake first happened, there was nothing funny about it.
There was no way I was going to make fun of the Bay Bridge or I-880
collapse. But after a grace period, you could start telling jokes.
Now so many things are happening it's ridiculous.''
   Pitta suggests that ``the networks are going to keep crews out
here all the time just to wait for disasters.''
   The thousands of people complaining of feeling more vulnerable
these days are experiencing a normal reaction, but they should seek
help if the fear gets too intense or lasts more than a couple of
months, psychologists say.
   ``Many people have had trouble sleeping or eating properly,''
said Rosemary Martinez, a social worker and psychological clinician
at the Mission Crisis unit. ``But when they are unable to leave
home because it's the only place they feel safe, at that point they
really need to be seen on an emergency basis.''
   Recent immigrants, the homeless and people dealing with personal
tragedies are more severely affected psychologically by the
disasters, said Dr. Allen Turpin, a psychiatrist who treats many
Soviet immigrants.
   ``It's been really traumatic for them, especially the older and
more recent immigrants,'' Turpin said. ``They still can't sleep
well. It seems everything is still shaking.''
   ``Their lives are unsettled and this exacerbates what they're
already going through.''
   One newcomer to the region has been closer to the disasters than
most, but she's vowing to keep on.
   Joyce Vincentz, a 25-year-old New Jersey native, was aboard a
commuter train that plowed into a chartered bus Monday. The next
morning, she arrived for work in the Financial District minutes
after the 240-ton crane fell onto a busy street.
   After each accident, she called her mother in New Jersey to
assure her she was OK.
   ``After the earthquake, everybody in the East asked me if I was
packing my bags,'' she said. ``I said, `No, it will take more than
an earthquake.' And then I was on the train. So ... my mother asked
if I was going to pack my bags. And I said, `No, it will take more
than that.'''
