   Even as residents of Northern California
begin the process of rebuilding, scientists are launching research
efforts in hopes of learning something from Tuesday's earthquake to
help them warn people the next time.
   And there will be a next time. Scientists can predict that and
say approximately where the tremor will strike.
   It's when that troubles them.
   The Loma Prieta area where Tuesday's quake was focused, for
example, was singled out as a region where a quake was considered
likely. But scientists couldn't pin down the time except to say
sometime between 1988 and 2018.
   Like weather forecasters a century ago, geologists today look at
what has happened in the past and try to use that information to
predict what will come in the future.
   But while today's weather satellites allow meteorologists a
bird's-eye view of the approaching weather, geologists still
struggle to analyze events miles below the land surface.
   ``It's difficult to make short-term predictions of
earthquakes,'' admitted Robert Wesson, chief of the Office of
Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Engineering at the U.S. Geological
Survey.
   ``I would say there was a successful long-term prediction of
this quake,'' he said, pointing out the Survey report issued last
year.
   ``Unfortunately, we didn't have any warning of this earthquake
last night,'' said Wesson.
   ``Really, we don't know how to make short-term predictions of
earthquakes, either little ones or big ones,'' he admitted.
   Sometimes smaller shocks foreshadow a major quake, and that may
have happened in this case too.
   The region had remained relatively quiet for several years,
until a quake estimated at 5.1 on the Richter scale occurred on
June 27, 1988, and another rated at 5.2 struck on Aug. 8 of this
year.
   Those events prompted the agency to pay increased attention to
the Loma Prieta region and to notify California officials, Wesson
said. But little could be done beyond that because there was no way
to tell if the tremors were foreshocks or just individual quakes on
their own.
   Using historical records of quakes, measurements of ground
motion and other analyses, scientists are able to single out places
where they believe tremors will strike _ much as they were able to
predict that the Mount St. Helen's volcano would erupt _ but not
when.
   Such predictions ``are not useful in evacuating dangerous
buildings, but they are useful in land use planning and resource
allocation in anticipation of future events,'' said Wesson.
   Dave Russ, assistant chief geologist at the Survey, explained
that quakes occurring along faults in the earth release stress that
builds up over time. When this movement releases stress in one area
the strain can be increased in other spots. But whether that would
induce major quakes in those areas cannot be predicted, he said.
   A strong quake does trigger thousands of smaller aftershocks as
the many rocks along the fault line adjust themselves, and there
remains the chance of strong aftershocks, he said.
   Russ said officials are looking for ``any unusual
characteristics'' in their studies of the quake, measured by
sensitive equipment that calculates the movement of land, changes
in the strain on rocks and uplift of the earth, among other things.
They hope their findings will help them understand, and thus
predict, future quakes.
