   California emergency officials Thursday
issued the nation's first detailed plan for warning the public of
imminent earthquakes and valid quake predictions.
   Scientists still can't predict exactly when and where a quake
will occur. But the new plan reflects scientists' growing ability
to use historic patterns of seismic activity to identify times and
places where odds of a damaging earthquake are greater than usual.
   The 140-page Short-Term Earthquake Prediction Response Plan
spells out how scientists and officials will warn the public of
such situations, as well as policies and procedures for responding
to predictions, the state Office of Emergency Services said.
   The plan was released during a meeting of 180 Southern
California government officials. The conference was designed to
help them learn how to protect public safety when the state
endorses an earthquake prediction or issues a formal warning,
called an advisory, that a dangerous quake may be imminent.
   ``There is no other state - or even the federal government -
that has such a formal plan to respond to earthquake predictions
and forecasts,'' said Richard Andrews, the emergency agency's chief
deputy director.
   Andrews said the plan sharply contrasts with the depiction of
state emergency officials in NBC's mini-series, ``The Big One: The
Great Los Angeles Earthquake,'' that will be broadcast nationwide
Sunday and Monday nights. In the movie, a state official tries to
suppress a quake prediction to protect real estate interests.
   ``The very clear policy of the state of California is that
scientific conclusions and validated earthquake predictions will be
issued to the government and public in a systematic way,'' Andrews
said.
   Research by the U.S. Geological Survey shows that after any
quake in California, there is a 6 percent chance of a larger quake
within a few days.
   After several quakes in recent years, state officials used that
knowledge to issue advisories that there was an increased chance of
a larger quake within three to five days.
   The new plan contains specific procedures state emergency
officials will use to consult with scientists and issue future
quake advisories, hopefully within two hours of a quake that may be
a foreshock to a seismic disaster.
   Andrews said such warnings will allow county and city officials
to activate emergency operations centers, charge up emergency
generators, evacuate high-risk buildings, close schools, and urge
people to stay home.
   The plan also specifies how the Office of Emergency Services and
the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council will
evaluate and respond to quake predictions.
   The response could range from declaring the prediction invalid
to endorsing a prediction by issuing a formal warning or even
urging the governor to declare a state of emergency to prepare for
possible imminent disaster.
   Studies of public reaction to warnings of hurricanes and other
disasters show residents will not panic in response to a quake
warning, but will take appropriate steps to prepare, said Denis
Mileti, a Colorado State University sociologist. He is chairman of
the National Academy of Sciences' natural disasters committee.
   California officials issued two earthquake advisories in 1988
and 1989 after quakes over magnitude 5 on the Richter scale
ruptured the San Andreas Fault in Northern California's Santa Cruz
Mountains.
   Those advisories expired without a larger quake. But the same
section of the fault finally gave way in the magnitude 7.1 Loma
Prieta quake that killed more than five dozen people and caused at
least $7 billion in damage in the San Francisco Bay area in October
1989.
   Andrews and others credited the warnings for raising the level
of preparedness in the region, averting even greater destruction
when the larger quake hit.
