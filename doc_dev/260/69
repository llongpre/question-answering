<LEADPARA>  It didn't take much to rattle earthquake-weary Californians Tuesday.;   First,
there was a groundswell of uneasiness because a "big one" was predicted for
today by a San Jose stereo seller who claims to pick up unusual AM radio
signals before big quakes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And then a magnitude 3.1 temblor, followed by a 2.7 jolt, hit the Santa
Cruz area Tuesday evening, sending people scurrying into the streets. Some who
felt the ground move were wondering whether amateur prognosticator Jack Coles
is more accurate than the scientists who debunk him.;   "I thought he was a
crank, but maybe he knows what he's doing," said Claudia Hill, who felt a
slight movement at her home in the foothills in South San Jose.;   The evening
shocks, felt from San Jose to Watsonville, caused no damage or injuries. But
the Earth's movement led to increased chatter about whether Coles, a
37-year-old stereo salesman from San Jose, was a genius or just goofy.;  
Coles, who says he predicted the 1989 Loma Prieta and other big quakes,
maintained that Tuesday evening's shaking was a precursor to a major
earthquake today along the Hayward fault.;   Scientists, however, said it was
more likely the Santa Cruz quakes were aftershocks of the Loma Prieta
earthquake, which occurred along the San Andreas fault system. Quakes of that
magnitude occur somewhere in the Bay Area roughly once a week and usually go
unnoticed, they said.;   'It's probably the largest aftershock of the Loma
Prieta earthquake in some time, but it's not unusual," said Pat Jorgenson,
spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, adding that there is
no "absolutely no scientific value" in Coles' unusual methods.;   Even before
the two small shakers, there were enough jitters in the Bay Area to make
rational people act as though they were expecting the end of the world.;   The
San Jose Police Department conducted an earthquake preparedness drill this
morning on its radio channel 9 but announced at regular intervals that "this
is a drill" to keep from scaring people who might be monitoring police
frequencies, a communications spokesman said.;   A similar drill will be held
from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. next Wednesday, and a countywide drill will be held
during those hours Sept. 26 on channels 7 and 8.;   Software programmer Bob
Jensen, along with a few pals at Tandem Computers, was thinking of calling in
sick today and fleeing with his family to the San Joaquin Valley. Ron Nelson
and his neighbors in the Santa Cruz Mountains were taking glass and valuables
down from the shelves and securing their houses.;   And thousands of residents
were loading up on bottled water and flashlight batteries. Others were packing
their cars with survival gear and rushing to get earthquake insurance.;   "You
can't ignore it," said Nelson, whose Redwood Estates house suffered extensive
damage in the Loma Prieta earthquake. "Everyone went through too much to just
dismiss a thing like this. After all, once bit, twice shy.";   Coles, who says
he was fielding up to 120 telephone calls per hour Tuesday, predicted a 72
percent chance of a major temblor along the Hayward fault today. The fault
generally runs along the East Bay foothills from Richmond to San Jose. He also
predicted there will be a second jolt within 100 miles of the Bay Area.;  
"The faults are slipping," Coles said Tuesday night, adding that signals were
intensifying, even though his prediction did not relate to the San Andreas
fault. "We'll see the other (earthquakes) real soon.";   Coles says he hears
the earth's faint thumps and thuds at the low end of the AM band. But
scientists say such waves are not likely to travel through miles of rock, and
they put no credence in Coles' predictions.;   "Our scientists have looked at
his work, and there is nothing to even remotely indicate when and where there
will be earthquakes," Jorgenson said.;   While authorities are generally happy
to see heightened interest in earthquake preparedness, Coles' alert has
prompted undue alarm because there are no proven methods to forecast
earthquakes, they say.;   "Our major concern is that people not panic," said
Earl Thompson, who directs Santa Clara County's emergency service office. "We
don't want people getting in their cars and leaving in droves. We don't want
people to make a rush on the grocery stores.";   Nevertheless, some people
were acting on their uneasiness.;   "He called one in Pasadena and he called
the one in Loma Prieta," said Kurt Smith, owner of the Entertainment Junction
in Redwood Estates. "The guy may be a little weird, but how do we know he's
not going to call this one?";   The prediction is "fueling a latent anxiety
about earthquakes," said David Aguilera, a psychologist who counseled victims
of the Loma Prieta disaster. "That earthquake left a lasting mark on our
psyche, and people are going to react when they hear these kinds of
predictions.";   After talking with co-workers this week, Tandem software
programmer Jensen said it was likely he would take a day off and drive his
family to Sacramento.;   "What do I have to lose?" he asked. "If he's wrong, I
just took a day off. If he's right, then we're safe from an earthquake.";   In
Santa Cruz Tuesday night, some people were wondering whether the Big One had
arrived a day early.;   "Maybe there is something to those radio waves,"
quipped Santa Cruz City Councilman Louis Rittenhouse after several people
attending a packed council meeting bolted for the doors.  </TEXT>
