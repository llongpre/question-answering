   Johnny Carson returned with a vengeance
to his late-night show, poking fun at revelations of White House
astrology in a monologue he wrote himself to end reruns forced by a
2-month-old writers' strike.
   ``I just could not stay away any longer from all things that are
going on in the country. I was compelled to come back,'' Carson
said Wednesday in his first new show since the strike began March 7.
   ``You know, we finally have a clue now as to what the hell (are)
the Looney Tunes things that have been coming out of Washington,''
he told viewers of ``The Tonight Show.''
   Carson referred to revelations by former White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan that Nancy Reagan regularly consulted an
astrologer to determine President Reagan's schedule.
   ``We apparently have a new cabinet officer in the government I
was not aware of _ the Secretary of Health, Education and
Soothsaying.
   ``I am not an expert on astrology, I know a little bit about it,
but I understand the horoscope with the chart as they call it, is
divided into the so-called 12 houses, and I just didn't know the
White House was one of them,'' Carson quipped.
   ``Apparently the astrologist says that Reagan's sign is the
rising house of Aquarius. Nancy's house is, I think, in the house
of Adolfo. I could be wrong, it could be Bill Blass, but I think
that's close,'' he joked, referring to the fashion designers.
   Carson also quoted an astrologist as saying that ``Reagan
performs at his best during a full moon.''
   ``Big deal,'' Carson said. ``So does the Wolfman.''
   Carson pointed out that Reagan said he never made a policy
decision based on astrology, then _ dropping into an imitation of
Reagan's voice _ Carson said, ``Well, because that little pointer
on my Ouija board moved to `No.'''
   The host of the NBC-TV show also found time to poke fun at his
marriage and California earthquake predictions involving 16th
century seer Nostradamus.
   ``Things were getting a little testy around the homestead,'' he
said. ``I really believe that one more week off and my marriage
would be resolved by small arms fire.''
   Carson mentioned the stir in Los Angeles because of persistent
rumors that Nostradamus forecast an earthquake for a city widely
believed to be Los Angeles.
   ``He was a flim-flam man of the 16th century,'' Carson said.
``If Nostradamus were alive today he would be Geraldo Rivera.''
Rivera entertained millions of television viewers with stunts such
as the opening of Al Capone's vault.
   Carson announced last week he would return to the air, writing
his own monologues.
   Carson, who is not a member of the striking Writers Guild of
America, said at that time there had been good-faith negotiations
and that all possibilities of reaching an agreement with the movie
and TV industry were exhausted.
   ``We're glad to be back. As far as the writers' strike, we're
not going to discuss it,'' he said. ``I have a lot of friends who
are writers. It is not fun to come to work when you see your
friends who you've known for many years standing out on a picket
line.
   ``And it's a weird picket line. The writers are out there
holding up these signs and there's nothing on them,'' he quipped.
