   A strong earthquake Sunday hit the western
island of Cephalonia and triggered a landslide, but that didn't
surprise Greek scientists. They said they predicted the quake the
night before.
   There were no reports of casualties or building damage, but the
quake ``shook everybody awake this morning'' said a police officer
on the island.
   The Athens Seismological Institute said the quake registered 5.5
on the Richter scale and hit at 6:44 a.m. It was the second strong
quake to hit the island in five days.
   The Seismological Institute said Sunday's tremor was centered
about 187 miles west of the capital, in the Ionian seabed close to
Cephalonia.
   On Saturday night, Athens University scientists monitoring the
earth's electrical field predicted the quake.
   Professor Panayotis Varotsos, a physicist who developed the
seismic prediction method in the early 1980s, said it was ``the
second time in a week the system worked with real accuracy.''
   ``We sent a telegram to the co-ministerial committee on
earthquakes last night that predicted the timing, strength and
location of today's earthquake,'' Varotsos said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   Officials on the committee could not be immediately reached for
comment.
   Varotsos' telegram, timed at 8:30 p.m. Saturday, predicted a 5.3
quake with an epicenter identical to that of the real quake.
   ``We said the quake was an aftershock to last Wednesday's
earthquake and would therefore occur within seven hours,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, a tremor measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale shook
Cephalonia and parts of western Greece, cracking village houses in
the Aetolia-Acharnania province on the mainland. There were no
reports of injuries.
   Varotsos' monitoring team had predicted Wednesday's quake three
days earlier in a similar telegram to the committee, which helps
fund his research.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake
through the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a
``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a
``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.
   On Cephalonia, a police officer said Sunday's quake triggered a
landslide that blocked a road near the island's main town of
Argostoli.
   The police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
there were no reports of casualties or cracked buildings on the
island.
   Structures on quake-prone Cephalonia are built to resist
earthquakes of more than 7 on the Richter scale.
   In August 1953, a disastrous earthquake in the Ionian Islands
off western Greece killed more than 400 people and leveled more
than 25,000 houses on Cephalonia and the nearby islands of Ithaca
and Zakynthos.
   Since 1983, Varotsos and his team have operated 18 monitoring
stations on mainland Greece that track electrical impulses emitted
from the earth.
   ``This week's predictions were the most successful ever ...
experience is fine-tuning the method,'' he said.
   Using electrodes inserted six feet into the ground and an
amplifier linked to a microcomputer, the scientists keep a 24-hour
watch for variations in the earth's electric field that would
indicate an earthquake was building.
   ``Before an earthquake occurs, there are stresses in the ground
that cause emissions of different electrical signals,'' Varotsos
said.
   He said the time lag between changes in the electrical field
ranged from seven hours to one week, but that usually the quake
strikes within 45-60 hours.
   Varotsos said that by increasing the number of monitoring
stations ``to around 40, including some on the Aegean islands, it
should be possible to accurately predict every tremor in the region
over 5 Richter.''
   Varotsos said similar sensor networks have been installed in
Japan in a research program operated by Tokyo University
seismologists.
   He described the theoretical background to his earthquake
forecasting methods in a book published in the Netherlands in 1986
and in articles in an Amsterdam-based scientific journal,
Tectonophysics.
