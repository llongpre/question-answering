   An earthquake shook parts of Illinois,
Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Indiana this morning,
but no major damage was reported.
   The quake was felt at at 8:19 a.m. CDT. It registered 4.6 on the
Richter scale and was centered along the New Madrid fault 40 miles
north of New Madrid, Mo., according to Don Kelly, a spokesman for
the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va.
   New Madrid has been the site of some of the greatest earthquakes
in U.S. history. The New Madrid fault line runs from Marked Tree,
Ark., to southern Illinois and has hundreds of small quakes every
year.
   Although there were no accounts of damage, the temblor rattled
nerves throughout the region, which has been on edge about
predictions of a major quake.
   Kenneth Rutledge, who lives 16 miles east of Hopkinsville, Ky.,
said he was sitting in his living room when the quake hit.
   ``I'm telling you it moved me,'' he said.
   Leonard Nash, who was visiting a farm in Piggott in northeastern
Arkansas, said: ``You could feel it and hear things moving in the
house. It lasted just a few seconds.
   ``It didn't excite us too much. It wasn't anything that was that
frightening. We just looked at each other, said `Hey, that was an
earthquake' and continued our talking.''
   Scott Chambers, the director of Emergency Medical Services in
Corning, Ark., said he felt the temblor at the local hospital.
   ``It was about like standing real close to a train track when a
train comes by, a little harder than that,'' he said.
   Three or four cataclysmic earthquakes struck the New Madrid
fault in the winter of 1811-12 and were felt as far away as Boston.
They have been estimated at about 8 on the Richter scale, which
didn't exist at the time.
   There have been predictions that an earthquake is likely along
the New Madrid fault before the end of the century. Recently, a
scientist in New Mexico predicted that a major quake could occur in
early December, prompting increases in insurance sales and other
preparatory measures.
   Other experts dispute his theory of a tidal trigger to
earthquakes but say a major quake in the region is bound to happen
eventually.
   ``I don't think this is a precursor to a larger event,'' Elaine
Foust of the U.S. Geological Survey in Nashville said today. ``But
we could flip a coin and decide. I'm not God, I can't predict.''
   Cecil Whaley, operations officer for the Tennessee Emergency
Management Agency in Nashville, also pooh-poohed the five-second
shake.
   ``People who live on solid rock probably did not feel it,''
Whaley said. ``This appears to be normal . . . We have small ones
two or three times a week, usually imperceptible.''
   In Indiana, a dispatcher said the Evansville Police Department
had received about 60 calls from concerned citizens shortly after
the quake, but had received no reports of damage.
   Dan Moran felt the quake at the Evansville Museum of Arts and
Sciences, which is featuring an earthquake exhibit this fall.
   ``Maybe this will help grab people's attention again about the
inevitability of earthquakes,'' Moran said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as mesured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase of one number, say from magnitude 5.5 to
magnitude 6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
Some experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30
times greater. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage. A
quake of magnitude 5 is capable of considerable damage.
   Last October's earthquake in San Francisco registered 7.1.
