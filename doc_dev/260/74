   While jittery Southern Californians sweated
out earthquake aftershocks last week, officials took another step
in a pioneering effort to issue warnings when they believe stronger
jolts might be on the way.
   ``We're trying to save lives and property with whatever
knowledge the scientists can derive from their instruments,'' said
Michael Guerin, spokesman for California's Office of Emergency
Services.
   Researchers are still a long way from being able to predict the
exact time and place of earthquakes. But they are learning to use
statistics on historical quakes to estimate the odds that one jolt
might be followed soon by a larger one.
   There is about a 5 percent chance a moderate quake in California
will be followed within three days by an equal or bigger jolt,
according to research by U.S. Geological Survey seismologists Paul
Reasenberg and Lucile Jones.
   So, four hours after a moderate quake measuring 5.5 on the
Richter scale shook Southern California on Wednesday, the Office of
Emergency Services issued a formal earthquake advisory to four
counties and the news media. It said scientists believed an equally
powerful or stronger quake could happen within three days.
   The advisory _ officials avoided calling it a warning or
prediction _ expired Saturday without a bigger quake, although
dozens of smaller aftershocks rattled the region, including one
that measured 3.4 on the Richter scale Sunday.
   It was only the fifth time since 1985 the state issued such an
advisory.
   The other advisories, which also expired without a strong quake,
were issued in June 1984 after three magnitude-4 quakes in San
Diego, in July 1986 after a 6.1 quake in the eastern Sierra Nevada,
and in June 1988 and August 1989 following 5.0 and 5.2 temblors on
the San Andreas Fault south of San Francisco Bay.
   The section of the San Andreas involved in the 1988 and 1989
advisories finally ruptured on Oct. 17, 1989, in the 7.1-magnitude
earthquake that killed 67 people in the San Francisco Bay region.
   Officials have said the advisories raised the level of public
preparedness for that disaster.
   Because of differing scientific opinions and a desire to avoid
public panic, the latest advisory was even more vaguely worded than
previous ones, Guerin said. It neither cited a percentage
likelihood for a larger quake, nor said how large that quake might
be.
   ``Right now in this branch of science, vague is
state-of-the-art,'' Guerin said.
   Al Langworthy, a San Bernardino County emergency planner, said
the advisory didn't alter local precautions undertaken after the
main quake.
   But Lt. Gary Schoeller of the Los Angeles County sheriff's
Emergency Operations Bureau said quake advisories can spur
authorities and citizens to take precautions.
   Examples include ``taking fire trucks outside fire stations
(which might collapse and crush them), and alerting our people
there may be a need to call them to duty,'' Schoeller said.
   Guerin said the state hopes citizens heed advisories by avoiding
hazardous old buildings during high-risk periods, moving home
furnishings that might topple, making sure a wrench is available to
shut off gas lines, knowing the whereabouts of relatives, and
stockpiling food, water, flashlights, radios and batteries.
   But the higher the potential for disaster, the greater the
caution by officials.
   A magnitude-6.2 quake near the California-Mexico border on Nov.
23, 1987, spurred an all-night vigil by scientists and officials as
aftershocks migrated toward the San Andreas Fault. They debated
whether to issue an advisory saying the quake might be a foreshock
to the long-feared 8.3-magnitude ``big one'' the government has
said might kill 14,000 people.
   No advisory was issued and the ``big one'' didn't happen, but
the 6.2 quake was followed 12 hours later by a magnitude-6.6 jolt
on another nearby fault. Ninety-four people were injured.
