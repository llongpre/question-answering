Sir Norman Fowler should spend his evenings in Durham this week. It is the
duty of the chairman of the Conservative party to watch out for constructive
thinking in the Labour party. If Sir Norman tiptoes into the Exhibition Hall
on Palace Green and stands silently at the rear he will strike paydirt. He
will hear the Labour MP for Birkenhead, Mr Frank Field, deliver four
lectures on why his party always loses, and how it can win.
Let me explain why Sir Norman will find it worthwhile to make a few
clandestine trips. He is not asked to travel north in the expectation that
he will discover how to prevent the opposition from winning. There is no
danger of that. Labour will not listen to what Mr Field says. It never does.
It would not do so if Nostradamus descended from Heaven and predicted that
heeding the words of the member for Birkenhead would guarantee a majority of
50 seats at the next election and 100 at the one following. No, the prize to
be had in Durham is in the form of a fresh stimulus to Tory thinking.
Such a trophy has been picked up before, and from the same source. In 1976
Mr Field advocated that Labour should transfer the ownership of council
houses to their tenants. The people's party rejected his proposal. The then
Mrs Thatcher's hard-faced Tories made a vote-winner out of it. 'No policy
 .comes anywhere near to having the impact this ..has had in summing up what
political parties stand for,' says its self-proclaimed author now. 'While
the Conservatives scooped the advantages, Labour's fractious opposition to
the sale of council houses marked its card equally clearly.' The text of Mr
Field's first Durham lecture is a touch braggadocio, but the general
conclusion it draws is inescapable.
Conservatives have consistently presented themselves as on the side of those
who want 'freedom to get on and build their own lives', he said last night.
Labour has as strenuously contrived to be seen as the party that wants 'to
hold people down'. All the currently fashionable theories about why it lost
the past four elections are brushed away in favour of this simple
observation.
Long before Mrs Thatcher came along people were 'opting for their own form
of privatisation' by building their own world, one which 'ruthlessly
excluded officialdom.' Money taken in taxes competed with the cost of new
kitchens, bathrooms, or family holidays. The Tories understood and
encouraged this; Labour did the opposite. Mr Field points out that one of Mr
John Major's prominent speaking engagements in last year's election campaign
was at a do-it-yourself store.
This perception that Labour must appeal to the aspirations of the ordinary
voter is not new. It is at the centre of the thinking of most of the
'modernisers' in the Labour party, including Mr Peter Mandelson, Mr Giles
Radice, Mr Nick Raynsford and the potential leader of a resurgent
opposition, Mr Tony Blair. It is emphatically not the same as saying that
any party hoping to win must ape the Conservatives.
Mr Field is no closet Tory. In his second lecture tonight he will draw on
his position as chairman of the parliamentary select committee on social
security. When Baroness Thatcher was in office she occasionally called him
in for a chat. Now he is merciless in his analysis of the divisive effect of
her government's policies. He flays her with accusations. The very rich have
done very well. The rest have not. The bottom 80 per cent have not increased
their share of total income, no matter how you measure it. The top 20 per
cent have. The pay of the poorest tenth of British male wage-earners is now
lower, as a proportion of median earnings, than it was when records began in
1886. The number of people dependent on welfare has grown more since 1979
than it did in the previous 30 years. Two-thirds of the population live in
households with incomes below the average . . .
Old Labour reaches two old conclusions. Either more must be spent on social
security, or the present budget should be reallocated. The leader of the
party, Mr John Smith, has appointed a Commission for Social Justice to see
how these alternatives can be worked out. Echoing President Bill Clinton, Mr
Field wants to get people off welfare. He wants total spending reduced,
individual dependent's incomes increased. He proposes a 'Commission on
Economic Opportunity' which would work out policies necessary to
re-establish full employment as a Labour goal. Another Labour thinker, the
self-exiled Mr Bryan Gould, was talking of much the same thing in the BBC TV
programme 'On the Record' at the weekend.
I hope Sir Norman is still listening tomorrow night. As a former social
security minister and the progenitor of private pensions, he should turn on
his tape recorder. The member for Birkenhead proposes to 'give people
control over their own pension capital ..' He clearly believes that in this
he has a winner equivalent to the sale of council houses. His complex
exposition of the idea indicates that he is better placed to point the way
than he is to draw the map. He recognises that unitisation of pension assets
would jeopardise the principle that pensions should equal half to two thirds
of final salaries. He wants a phased-in move to 'voluntary friendly
societies' in which individuals, not employers, own the funds. Money
purchase schemes should be reformed; employers should continue to
contribute, as the best do now.
Mr Field has floated other big-bang wheezes. He has suggested that the
savings on state pensions could facilitate a cut in the standard rate of
income tax to 15p. He has favoured 'workfare' as a concomitant of full
employment. The common thread has been to give people the dignity of earning
their own money, while allowing them to keep as much of it as possible. Sir
Norman might laugh and say that that is what Conservatives want. Mr Field
tries to show how his party might successfully offer an alternative, one
that serves the interests of the bottom 80 per cent. We will have to take
Labour seriously when it overcomes its understandable irritation at the
bumptiousness of the member for Birkenhead and adopts his central theme.
Meanwhile, the pickings are there for Sir Norman.
