   The Star Wars raged on at the White House yesterday, as President Reagan angrily rejected a claim that astrology played a role in his presidency but aides quickly backtracked. 

   When a reporter asked during a Rose Garden ceremony whether he would continue to use an astrologer's advice in planning his daily schedule, Mr. Reagan retorted, "You asked for it. 
No. 
I can't -- because I never did." 

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later said that the president misunderstood the question, and was denying only that astrology has ever shaped his policy decisions. 

   The furor was sparked by claims in a new book by former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan that the president's schedule is "in the hands of an astrologer in San Francisco" with whom Nancy Reagan consults. 

   While the president yesterday was trying to put the issue to rest, White House aides defended Mrs. Reagan's contacts with a San Francisco astrologer and left the impression that Mrs. Reagan may continue to rule out astrological "bad days" as she helps shape the president's schedule. 

   "She does plan to continue to talk to her," Mrs. Reagan's press secretary Elaine Crispen said in an interview, referring to astrologer and socialite Joan Quigley. 
"It's a harmless thing." 

   Syndicated columnist Carl Rowan, who had lunch with Mr. Reagan yesterday, said the president denounced the book as "a bunch of falsehoods" and declared "I'll be damned if I'll just stand by and let them railroad my wife." 

   Defending Mrs. Reagan's interest in using astrology to protect her husband, Ms. Crispen and Mr. Fitzwater said it stemmed from the trauma of the March 1981 assassination attempt. 
"She was scared to death. 
You just reach out to whoever you can. 
She was really grasping at everyone" who could make her feel better about his safety, Ms. Crispen said. 

   Most of the president's schedule is routinely checked with Mrs. Reagan as a courtesy, Ms. Crispen said. 
"If a Tuesday was better than a Wednesday (according to the astrologer), that may have given her some comfort" in scheduling events for him, Ms. Crispen concluded. 

   In his book, "For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington," the former White House chief of staff claims that the president "laid down no rules and articulated no missions." 
He describes Mrs. Reagan as the astrology-driven architect of important scheduling and personnel decisions, pushing for the firing of Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey, who died of cancer while in that post, and of Mr. Regan himself. 

   The first lady intends to have the last word in the "kiss and tell" series on the Reagan presidency, however. 
Her own book will be published by Random House sometime next year, Ms. Crispen said.
