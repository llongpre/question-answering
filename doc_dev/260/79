   A scientist's forecasts of possible earthquakes as
earlyas this weekend have gone largely unnoticed in this
quake-prone capital, a striking contrast to the fear created in
parts of the United States.
   New Mexico climatologist Iben Browning created a furor across
the Midwest when he said last summer that there was a 50 percent
chance of a strong quake on the NEw Madrid Fault within 48 hours on
either side of Dec. 3.
   The fault runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark., about 35
miles east of Memphis.
   Browning's daughter, Evelyn Browning Garriss, has said that
actually the scientist thinks a quake is more likely outside the
United States - especially in Japan. Ms. Browning says he based his
predictions on his observations of powerful high tides caused by
the alignment of the Earth, moon and sun. He says such forces can
trigger earthquakes.
Tokyo, and there has been no outward sign of concern in Japan
during the past week.
   The yen fell sharply against the dollar today, but dealers
attributed the decline to market players seeking a safe investment
after the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution to permit the
use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Kaneo Ogino, a dealer at Goldman Sachs (Japan), said of the
earthquake rumors: ``People overseas are overreacting. I don't know
Why stupid people are talking about an earthquake. We're ignoring
this bloody nuisance.''
   Window-rattling earthquakes are common in Japan, and the country
Is obsessed with being properly prepared for the next great
temblor. Buildings and infrastructure are all designed with
earthquakes in mind.
   The most destructive shock in modern history was the ``Great
Kanto Earthquake'' of Sept. 1, 1923, that destroyed a third of
Tokyo and most of neighboring Yokohama, killing 140,000 people.
Many perished in fires that raged through the largely wooden
cities.
   The intensity of that quake is estimated at 7.9 on the Richter
scale.
   The strongest recent Japan quake was on March 6, 1984, also
registering 7.9 on the Richter scale. It caused only one death and
neglibile damage because the epicenter was located deep below the
pacific ocean seabed and well offshore.
