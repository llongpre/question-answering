<HEAD>Tass Makes Fun of Reagan over Astrology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass poked somewhat ponderous fun Wednesday at
President Reagan's reported faith in astrology, wondering in a
dispatch what the stars are telling the leader of the West.
   ``It is difficult to say what the May night sky, studded with
stars, predicted to the president, but it hardly predicted that he
would have to speak about the role of astrology in the politics of
the USA,'' the official news agency said.
   Recent reports in the United States that Reagan and his wife
Nancy consult astrologers inspired taunts from Congress and
criticism from scientists.
   Some reports said Donald T. Regan, former White House chief of
staff, plans to say in a book that Mrs. Reagan turned to
astrologers in shaping the president's schedule.
   On Tuesday, Reagan denied having been swayed by the stars in
making policy decisions, but Tass characterized his comments as
evasive.
   ``When he appeared on Tuesday in one of the halls of the White
House, reporters practically showered him with questions,'' the
agency said. ``They wondered to what extent astrologers and
fortune-tellers influenced him when he had to make political
decisions.
   ``He was quick to answer, but he tried to escape from direct
answers to further questions. All this has not clarified the
questions raised, and now more Americans are asking themselves: May
it be true that the president determines the country's political
course with the help of the stars?''
