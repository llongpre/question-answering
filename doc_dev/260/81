</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The men's basketball coaches and players at San Diego State, the University of 
San Diego and U.S. International might be pained to read the numbers in the 
Guinness Book of World Records: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On June 25, 1977, Ted St. Martin of Jacksonville, Fla., made 2,036 free 
throws in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Newman of San Jose made 88 consecutive free throws blindfolded and 338 
of 356 (94.9%) in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 24 hours, Jeff Liles made 15,138 of 17,862 (84.7%). 
</P>
<P>
Last year, UC San Diego's Rob Rittgers set NCAA Division III records for most 
and consecutive free throws in a game when he made 30 of 30, including 24 
successive technical foul shots, against Menlo College. 
</P>
<P>
And 2-year-old Hank Martin of Cincinnati once made -- with a smaller ball and 
basket -- 2 of 6 shots on "Late Night with David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
Worth one point, a free throw is like a 2-foot putt in golf, a 
fourth-and-inches situation in football or a second serve in tennis. It is 
expected to be made, a routine action that draws the most attention when 
missed. This target is 15 feet away and 10 feet high, and nobody is allowed 
directly in front or within 5 feet of the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
The free throw. Even its name implies ease. 
</P>
<P>
But for San Diego's three NCAA Division I men's teams, the free throw has been 
costly in 1988-89. The percentages are .629 at SDSU, .605 at USIU and .600 at 
USD. Each can attribute at least two losses to bad days at the so-called 
"charity stripe." 
</P>
<P>
And while the local Division I men's teams have wallowed around 60% at the 
line, the women's teams at each school are near 70% or better: SDSU is shooting 
74.5%, USD 72.2% and USIU 69.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the statistics have been some dubious occurrences for the men and 
terrific distinctions for the women. 
</P>
<P>
With a sprained thumb, Dana Jackson, a 38% free-throw shooter for SDSU, shot 
two air balls in a row at Utah. USIU has had two shots -- one by Steve Smith 
(72%), the other by Willie Davis (56%) -- hit nothing but air. Another USIU 
player, Tim Moore (30%), missed so wildly that the ball caromed back to him off 
the rubber bottom of the backboard. Mike Sterner, USIU's 6-foot 11-inch center, 
is shooting just 27% from the line. 
</P>
<P>
USD has been the most troubled, losing five games by five points or less. In 
each, poor free-throw shooting, especially down the stretch, was costly. The 
top free-throw shooter on the team, Wayman Strickland, is making 76%. Sophomore 
center Dondi Bell has improved somewhat this season, from 50% to 57%, with a 
new 1-handed style. 
</P>
<P>
USD women Candida Echeverria and Paula Mascari are making 87% and 81%, 
respectively, of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
For SDSU's women, the lowest percentage of the starters is freshman Crystal Lee 
at .739. Center Chana Perry has made 77% (78 of 101), Stefanie Massie 80% and 
Brooke Meadows 84%. Julie Evans has missed only 1 in 25 attempts (96%). For the 
men, Tony Ross (87.5%) is the only player above 80%. Only seven others are 
above 70%. One is Sam Johnson, who has improved from 49% last year to 78% this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
USIU has only three women's players (one injured, two reserves) below 67%. The 
men's team has eight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be a free shot," said Aztec center Mitch McMullen, a 50% 
free-throw shooter. "There's no excuse. Shame on us if we don't make it." 
</P>
<P>
So why the trend at each school? Could it be that women are better free throw 
shooters in general? Did Nostradamus predict the wrong shake-up? 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brandenburg, SDSU's men's coach, said, "I think women, in general, have 
better pairs of hands than men. To catch, to pass, to do a lot of different 
dexterous-type things. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that I could statistically prove it. But from my observation of 
30 years of coaching, women can probably outshoot the men within certain 
ranges." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Marpe, USD's women's coach, said, "Women have a more sensitive feel for 
the ball. And they tend to have more patience." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 25, 1986, Marpe's USD team set an NCAA record for free-throw shooting 
percentage in a game by making 24 of 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I think women may have a better mental attitude than men," says USIU men's 
Coach Gary Zarecky. "Everything I've read is that women handle stress better 
than men." 
</P>
<P>
It's all true, says Mike Brum, an SDSU graduate student who works with the 
men's and women's players as a sports psychologist consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been proven, women have a tendency to have greater control over fine 
muscle movement than men do," Brum said. "And they have a built-in system of 
handling stress because their bodies are prepared to bear children. They are 
better able to handle fine motor movements in stressful situations." 
</P>
<P>
Brum adds that free throw shooting is different from the rest of the game 
because you use different motor movements at the line. "I teach relaxation, 
focusing and key words in a process called backward shaping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brum said backward shaping is a method of going through and learning the 
fundamental movements in reverse order to eliminate errors and bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds very psychological, but SDSU women's Coach Earnest Riggins says, 
simply, "Free-throw shooting is mental discipline and concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Poor free-throw shooting, said Brandenburg, "Is kind of like being an 
alcoholic. You'll never beat it until you can say, 'Yes, I'm an alcoholic.' " 
</P>
<P>
What happens, Brandenburg said, "is it really becomes a psychological thing 
with a lot of players. Players that have high anxiety levels, players that are 
hyper and really want to please, those guys will get up there on that foul line 
and their heart comes right up in their throat. You can work on free throws and 
work on free throws, but sometimes you have good free-throw shooting teams and 
sometimes you don't." 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg said players also tend to see free throws as an unglamorous aspect 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's basketball, you will find very few players that see themselves as 
steady free-throw shooters," he said. "I don't think they picture themselves as 
great free-throw shooters. Those guys are in the minority. Nobody reacts to two 
silky smooth free throws. All the guys are jumping and dunking. So that's what 
young players react to. That's what gets the crowd going." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky said that when he was teaching a clinic in Yugoslavia, the European 
players did not want to hear about shooting because they felt they were already 
better shooters than Americans. They wanted to learn about fast breaks and 
fancy passes, because that's what Americans were noted for. 
</P>
<P>
Said USD Coach Hank Egan, "The men's game has become a lot more athletic. And 
maybe we're recruiting that way. Free-throw shooting is a skill function. 
Athleticism has nothing to do with free-throw shooting. Jumping and speed don't 
matter. It's a lot like hitting a golf ball. It's a lot of muscle familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry Bird (one of the NBA's best free-throw shooters) is not an athlete. He 
is the consummate skill player. He has overcome the lack of running and jumping 
ability with a tremendous amount of skill." 
</P>
<P>
For all the analysis, some of the local men's players just might be suffering 
from an affliction for which there is no cure. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln High School Coach Ron Loneski was a teammate of Wilt Chamberlain's at 
the University of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
"I played with the worst shooter in the world," he said, "and nobody had an 
answer for him."
