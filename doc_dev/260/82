   A destructive earthquake seems almost certain
to strike the eastern United States sometime in the next two
decades, a Senate subcommittee was told Friday.
   While scientists cannot predict when or where the quake might
hit, or its strength, they consider one almost sure to occur before
the year 2010, according to Robert L. Ketter, director of the
National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research.
   Both Ketter and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., cited the Armenian
quake in December as raising attention to similar dangers in the
United States.
   Quakes in the eastern part of the United States have received
less attention than those in the West because the strongest eastern
tremors came before the nation was heavily developed and thus led
to few losses of lives.
   Ketter told the subcommittee that while the likelihood of a
quake in any particular place is low, ``the probability of one
occurring somewhere in the Eastern United States before the year
2000 can be considered better than 75 percent to 95 percent. Before
the year 2010, nearly 100 percent.''
   The potential for quakes in Armenia was also well known, yet
lack of preparation left thousands dead and massive damage,
Cranston told the Senate subcommittee on science, technology and
space.
   ``The hazard in many parts of the U.S. is no less certain than
it was in Armenia,'' said Cranston, citing quakes that have caused
death and major damage in California, Idaho, Kentucky, Alaska and
other states.
   ``The challenge that faces us now is to use our new capability
and capacity for earthquake hazards reduction before we have to
face the public and explain our inaction _ as the Soviets now
must,'' Cranston said.
   The senator's comments came in support of a bill to strengthen
the national earthquake hazards program, including a transfer of
that activity to the U.S. Geological Survey. Currently the
earthquake program is part of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
   Cranston noted that earthquakes, once thought of as primarily a
California and Alaska problem, are now known to be a major danger
to many states.
   Perhaps the most powerful quake ever to strike the United States
occurred in a series of tremors in 1811-1812 that rocked the New
Madrid, Mo., region, Ketter testified.
   In addition, severe quakes in the 18th century and 19th century
struck Charleston, S.C.; Boston; under the ocean near New York
City, and in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Ketter told the
subcommittee.
   Compounding the problem is the fact that in the eastern states
underlying rocks are older and more dense. Thus, reported Ketter,
``earthquakes in the East can cause damage over a much larger area
than in the West.''
   One of the 1811 quakes in Missouri, for example, had a strength
similar to the 1906 San Francisco quake. The temblor in Missouri,
however, affected an area 15 times larger than the California quake.
   Lacy E. Suiter, chairman of the Central U.S. Earthquake
Consotrium, testified that there is a 40 percent to 63 percent
chance of a strong quake occurring in the Ned Madrid, Mo., region
by the turn of the century.
   Ketter said that if the 1811-1812 Missouri quakes were to occur
today, the death toll could approach 5,000 people with massive
destruction in such communities as Memphis, Tenn.; Paducah, Ky.;
Carbondale, Ill.; Evansville, Ind.; Poplar Bluff, Mo., and Little
Rock, Ark.
