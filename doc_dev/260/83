   A scientist's prediction that a quake might strike Missouri and
neighboring states Dec. 2 appears to have shaken loose the seismic
fears of people in the nation's heartland.
   The prediction by climatologist Iben Browning _ who claims to
have forecast the Oct. 17 Bay area quake but whose theories are
disputed by most seismologists _ has not created a panic.
   But along the New Madrid fault, the example of the Northern
California quake, coupled with Browning's forecast, has raised
awareness of earthquakes and earthquake safety.
   Insurance sales are up, a school district has tentatively
canceled classes and two states' National Guards have scheduled
drills that week.
   The fault, which roughly follows the Mississippi River from
Mississippi to Illinois, may not be as well known as the San
Andreas fault in California, but it commands respect among
earthquake experts.
   The last sizable quake on the fault was in 1895, but that's not
the one people talk about. The Big One _ actually, the Big Three or
Four _ occurred in 1811 and 1812, when a series of quakes centered
in New Madrid, Mo., rocked much of the eastern half of the nation.
   The quakes rang church bells in Washington, D.C., and are said
to have made the Mississippi River run backard. They have been
estimated at around 8 on the Richter scale.
   The quakes have become part of the folklore of the region _
``It's Our Fault,'' a T-shirt proclaims. But until recently, that
was about as far as it went.
   ``We talked about it for years,'' said Sheriff Jake Rone of New
Madrid County, ``but we never really got serious about it until
this thing happened.''
   The thing that has people talking up and down the New Madrid
fault is a projection by Browning, a scientist from Tijeras, N.M.,
that there could be a major quake in the region Dec. 2 or 3.
   Browning, 72, an inventor and climate consultant, bases his
projection on a convergence of tidal forces, which he believes can
put stress on earthquake faults. But he stresses it's a
possibility, not a certainty, that such a quake will happen.
   Still, he claims to have predicted last October's California
quake using the same method _ he says he warned a group of
executives in San Francisco seven days before the quake.
   Despite the disdain of seismologists, a school district in
Mississippi County, Ark., has tentatively canceled classes Dec. 3-4.
   Insurance agents in Arkansas say their business in quake
insurance policies picked up noticeably after the California
temblor and dramatically after word of Browning's projection became
public in March.
   The director of Indiana's Emergency Management Agency doesn't
necessarily believe the forecast, but he doesn't disbelieve it
either.
   ``I basically have taken the position we are not going to ignore
this prediction,'' Jerry Hauer said.
   Hauer also is chairman of the Central United States Earthquake
Consortium, which includes emergency management directors from the
states that would be hardest hit by a New Madrid quake _ Arkansas,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.
   The consortium has taken no action to prepare for a December
quake, and Hauer said Browning probably will be proved wrong.
   But just in case he isn't, Hauer said, ``If we have to schedule
National Guard drills during the month of December, why not
schedule them that week?''
   Officials in Missouri and Arkansas have already done just that,
both planning earthquake drills for guardsmen in the first few days
of December.
   ``If something does happen, we'll be there,'' said Arkansas
Guard spokeswoman Maj. Cissy Lashbrook. ``If nothing happens,
people will see we're prepared for this type of emergency.''
   Seismologists have mixed feelings about Browning's forecast.
It's not that they don't believe there will be a quake; they just
don't believe it can be forecast as specifically as Browning
suggests.
   As close as seismologists can pinpoint it, there's a 40 percent
to 63 percent chance of a severe quake _ one that is magnitude 6 on
the Richter scale _ on the New Madrid fault in the next 15 years.
   ``Yes, people ought to be prepared,'' said Klaus Jacob, a senior
research scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. ``They should be prepared
on Dec. 3 and 4. But they should also be prepared today and
tomorrow, and Dec. 1 and next year.''
   ``Earthquakes don't care about predictions,'' he said. ``And
people shouldn't worry about predictions; they should worry about
earthquakes.''
