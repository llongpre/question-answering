<LEADPARA>  Small cracks recently discovered along the San Andreas Fault in Santa Cruz
County may provide the strongest evidence yet that the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake was not centered on the San Andreas.;   At a conference in San
Diego today, researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park will
argue that the cracks date from the 1906 earthquake and a quake in the
mid-17th century. Because Loma Prieta did not cause a rupture in the area, the
researchers conclude it was not centered on California's longest and
best-known fault.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The findings illustrate the unusual extent to which Loma Prieta has upset
scientists' understanding of quakes, and their ability to predict future
temblors.;   Two years after Loma Prieta shook the Bay Area, researchers
continue to debate the reasons for the unexpected rise of the earth on the
west side of the fault, the violent ground-shaking relatively far from the
quake center and the gaping cracks opened in the Santa Cruz Mountains, among
other things.;   "It hasn't forced us to rewrite the book," said Bill
Ellsworth, a geophysicist for the Geological Survey. "But there are certainly
some chapters we have to rethink very carefully.";   Because it was centered
in an earthquake-prone region where scientists have placed dozens of monitors,
Loma Prieta generated far more information than is available for most quakes.
And with 200 scientists still on the job, it may become the most studied
earthquake in history.;   The resulting picture will be an immensely more
complicated view of the San Andreas, particularly the 45-mile crook in the
fault beneath the Santa Cruz Mountains between Saratoga and Hollister.
"Locally, (the fault) is a lot more complex than we thought," Ellsworth said.;
  The San Andreas is typically viewed as the boundary between the plates
underlying the Pacific Ocean on one side and North America on the other. The
plates are sliding past each other at about two inches a year, with the ocean
heading north and the continent south.;   In this model, earthquakes result
from strain built up as the uneven edges of the plates stick and then release
in a sudden lurch. Most of the movement generated by these quakes is lateral,
as the two sides of the fault move past each other.;   But this didn't explain
several features of Loma Prieta, particularly the way ground southwest of the
fault rose above, as much as it slid past, the ground on the other side. And
the instruments told scientists that the fault along which the quake began was
not vertical, as the San Andreas is believed to be, but tilted on a diagonal.;
  Almost from the start, these features led many geologists to theorize that
the quake was not centered on the San Andreas, but on a nearby fault.;   To
help resolve the issue, a team from the Geological Survey dug three
eight-foot-deep trenches across the San Andreas near Grizzly Flat in Santa
Cruz County, about five miles east of the Loma Prieta quake's epicenter. They
found vertical cracks that they believe to be evidence of the 1906 and
17th-century quakes. But there were no such cracks for Loma Prieta.;   "We
don't think the San Andreas Fault ruptured in the 1989 event," said Koji
Okumura, a geologist with the Geological Survey of Japan who has been working
with the USGS team.;   To explain Loma Prieta, scientists are focusing on the
crook in the San Andreas, where the northwestern motion of the Pacific Plate
forces it to collide with, rather than slide past, the North American Plate.
This squeezing is thought to form "thrust" faults, which are angled rather
than vertical and result in as much upward movement as sideways motion.;  
Many scientists now believe the Loma Prieta quake was centered on one of these
thrust faults. Some, such as Tom Holzer of the Geological Survey, talk of a
"Loma Prieta Fault.";   The findings add credence to an emerging theory that
there may be several kinds of earthquakes along this portion of the San
Andreas, each occurring relatively infrequently and semi-independently.;   "It
seems like there are different modes of how that breaks," said Steven Ward, a
geophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz's Institute of
Tectonics. "There may be two or three different kinds of earthquakes there."; 
 For example, the Geological Survey team studying trenches estimated that the
two quakes for which they found evidence took place 250 years apart. That's a
lot longer than the 75- to 100-year cycle in which San Andreas quakes were
thought to occur.;   At the same time, other scientists have uncovered
evidence of previous "Loma Prieta-style" quakes. After examining the cliffs
along Highway 1 near Santa Cruz, Ward estimated that such earthquakes have
occurred every 300 to 600 years. And by examining sediments revealed after
ground shifted near Highway 17, Los Gatos geologist William Cotton estimated
there had been 20 such quakes over the past 20,000 years.;   Those estimates
are consistent with scientists' gut feeling that Loma Prieta-style quakes
could not happen very often because their uplift would make the Santa Cruz
Mountains much taller than they are -- more like the Sierra Nevada.;   Still
to be resolved, however, is the important question of how these various types
of earthquakes relieve stress in one section of a fault and transfer it to
other sections. Those are crucial factors in predicting future quakes.;   The
current consensus is that Loma Prieta relieved some -- but not all -- of the
stress along the San Andreas in the southern Santa Cruz Mountains, meaning
there still is a threat of moderate earthquakes in the area. Most researchers
also believe the quake transferred some stress to other segments of the San
Andreas, particularly along the San Francisco Peninsula.;   "I don't think
we're near to understanding Loma Prieta," said Ivan Wong, a seismologist with
Woodward-Clyde Consultants in Oakland. "I think we're going to have to have
another earthquake before we understand these thrust faults."  </TEXT>
