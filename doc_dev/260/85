   First lady Nancy Reagan prevented President
Reagan from speaking out at the height of the Iran-Contra affair
because her astrologer told her the time was not right to go out in
public, former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan said
today.
   ``The president was practically immobile during that period of
December 1986, January and February of '87, all because the first
lady was saying no, no, no he can't go out,'' Regan said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``Now she used as an excuse the fact that he had a minor
operation right after the Christmas holidays. But I said, `No, this
president is going to get shot down in flames. He's not out talking
to the people about Iran-Contra. He should be making his own case.'
But he didn't.''
   In his book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,''
which went on sale today, Regan said he believes the president's
contention that he knew nothing of the Iran-Contra affair, in which
proceeds from secret U.S. arms sales to Iran were diverted to the
Nicaraguan rebels, until told about it by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III on Nov. 25, 1986.
   ``The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. He
blanched when he heard Meese's words. The color drained from his
face, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw the
president's reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment that
he knew about the diversion of funds before Meese told him about
it. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had
happened,'' Regan wrote.
   He said that he urged the president to conteract the effects of
the Iran-Contra affair by undertaking an active speaking schedule
outside Washington, but was balked by astrological advice to the
first lady that ``harm would come to Reagan if he went out of the
White House.''
   ``By humoring her, we had given her control,'' he said of Mrs.
Reagan.
   Regan, in his memoir, portrayed the president as a hesitant and
unassertive chief executive controlled by a wife who relied heavily
upon the predictions of an astrologer.
   Former press secretary Larry Speakes, who also wrote a ``kiss
and tell'' book about his years in the White House, said today he
was not aware of the first lady's reliance on astrology.
   ``I didn't see it and had no evidence of it,'' Speakes said on
CBS's ``This Morning'' show. ``I've got no reason to doubt. But I
never saw any crystal balls in the Cabinet Room. From time to time,
strange people did come into the White House. But I didn't know
that they were astrologers, if they were.''
   The White House issued a brief statement about the book on
Sunday that said: ``Vindictiveness and revenge are not admirable
qualities, and are not worthy of comment. Donald Regan's attempts
to defame the first lady, on Mother's Day no less, are certainly in
that category.''
   Asked about the White House statement, Regan responded: ``They
ought to know it when they see it.''
