Palme d'Or day at the film festival

INFLATION is amazing in Cannes. A cafe au lait costs two pounds. Elizabeth
Taylor costs Dollars 1m for a single night (the hoped-for revenue from her
Dollars 2500-a-table Cannes charity dinner for Aids). And as Palme d'Or
lobbying begins, the praise for individual films by loyalists and PR persons
grows balloon-like by the hour. One fears the day when, as happened to
Inflatable Arnie Schwarzenegger this week, a much-puffed movie suddenly
loses air and threatens to fizz round Cannes like a demented rubber sprite.
Jane Campion's The Piano is still the palmist's favourite; but Chen Kaige's
Farewell To My Concubine, a mid-festival cheer-raiser, may provide a photo
finish on prize night. This spectacular three-hour assault on the icy face
of recent Chinese history has two Peking Opera performers (played by Leslie
Cheung and Zhang Fengyi) acting as our sherpa guides. Their story begins in
1926, when they are thrown as boys into the brute disciplines of a
pre-Maoist opera school. Then it climbs onward and upward through Japanese
invasion, nationalist resistance, the Communists' coming to power and the
Cultural Revolution. Can the two men's precious art survive the blizzards of
history? Can they?
Chen Kaige belongs to the generation that has transformed Chinese cinema.
But his new film makes even Yellow Earth and Life On A String seem
apprentice work. The scene-painting is sensational. Here a Chinese opera
brought to life in all its regal eclat. Here a mist-strewn city street
suddenly thundered through by Japanese troops, scattering its crowds and
composure. Here the grim pageant of a light-raked Maoist show trial.
Within the great design the main characters wage their own emotional wars.
The actor who plays the Queen loves the actor who plays the King who loves a
glamorous courtesan (Gong Li). And when not wrestling with their private
lives, they are frogmarched off to face history's regular tribunals on
whether their art is edifying or reactionary.
The film stumbles only in later scenes when the historical signposts
multiply too fast. Nationalists routed to Taiwan; Red Army entering Peking;
Mao announcing Cultural Revolution . . . We want to cry 'Whoah' as the Great
Events begin to drag the human players in their traces, and the director
himself wields the didactic whip too strongly in using his characters to
castigate the grim kismet of his country.
But three hours of Chen Kaige is a trifle in the viewing compared to the 2
3/4 hours of the festival's rival marathon. Wim Wenders's Faraway So Close
is Wings Of Desire part two. The German director takes the earlier yarn's
themes and characters - Berlin angel Otto Sander, fallen-to-earth angel
Bruno Ganz, much metaphysical warbling about time, memory and emotion - and
shakes them around like dice before scattering them over the crazy-paved
plot.
The film starts with intimations of mortality - it is Sander's turn to fall
to earth and become human - and ends with imitations of Alastair McLean. The
climax is jaw-droppingly dotty. A raid on an arms vaults by an army of
trapeze artists; a hi-jacked barge; a mid-air shoot-out; and dear Horst (The
Magnificent Seven) Buchholz brought out of seclusion to play chief baddie.
There are depths, but you need McLean-style scuba equipment to find them.
Even early on, they are sunk beneath the gnomic voice-overs, the flotillas
of guest stars (Peter Falk, Nastassja Kinski, Mikhail Gorbachev) and the
stylistic surface as capricious and confused - now colour, now monochrome,
now slapstick, now serious - as an oil spill. Despite moments of magic,
Wenders has still not recovered from the try-anything prolixity that brought
us the Until The End Of The World. Faraway So Close is too much of too
little, or possibly too little of too much.
This we cannot say, despite title, of Much Ado About Nothing by William
Shakespeare in collaboration with Kenneth Branagh. Of the Anglo-American
movie contingent going for gold on the Cote d'Azur, this sun-bronzed Bardic
lark is the cheerleader. Branagh plays Benedick and - contain your surprise
 -Emma Thompson plays Beatrice. Add a half-dozen British theatre stalwarts
and a trio of box-office Americans (Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu
Reeves) and you have this feelgood verse epic set and shot in sunny
Palladian Italy.
Many have sniffed in disdain. I ended up sniffing in delight: my
handkerchief used for laughter in the early duels of wit was later used to
dab emotions at the film's authentically moving ending.
Two other Cannes films, Peter Greenaway's The Baby Of Macon and Stephen
Frears's The Snapper, represent the high-faluting and low-faluting ends of
British cinema. Neither are in competition, which is as well for Greenaway's
extravaganza which found popularity nowhere. In this cod 17th century
religious pageant, presented as a play within a film within a
theatre-cum-cathedral, the title tot wreaks havoc on the 'virgin' mother and
venal prelates who exploit his supposed miraculous powers.
A for idea, but C minus for clotted pace, monotonous rhythms and relentless
decoration. By curtain-time we have had rape, cannibalism, plainsong,
multiple nudity and the rest of the Greenaway baggage; and we are pining for
a simple British film like . . .
Well, in theory like Frears's The Snapper, scripted from his own novel by
Roddy Doyle of The Commitments. But though this is cheerful, it is also
fearfully slight. Ninety Irish minutes of 'Who's got Sandra pregnant?',
'Who's buying the next Guinness?' and 'How do we get the next chortle from
the audience?' It was made for TV and should perhaps go straight there:
though Colm Meaney's rumbustious performance as Dad deserves a bigger,
better setting.
The rest of Cannes has been show business as usual. The competition has
never been dull even when it has disappointed. Steven Soderbergh's King Of
The Hill is a sentimental but sweetly acted Depression tale from the
director who conquered Cannes three years ago with the tougher sex, lies and
videotape. Alain Cavalier's harsh, no-frills political fable Libera Me falls
short of his radiantly minimalist religious fable Therese (Cannes Jury Prize
winner 1986), but wins points for boldness in its eschewal of dialogue for a
mute cinema of gesture. And Stephan Elliott's comedy-thriller Frauds from
Australia has a silly plot about insurance scams but Phil Collins showing
surprising comic acting muscle as the dandyish villain.
For the rest, we liked caustic Chicago gangster Bill Murray laying waste the
acting competition, including Robert De Niro, in the American police romp
Mad Dog And Glory; Australian film-maker Bob Ellis limning a tender comedy
of adolescence and Armageddon in The Nostradamus Kid; and the real Arnold
Schwarzenegger guesting through Cannes and refusing to be upstaged by his
forty-foot blow-up doppelganger. As for the final hot-air event at Cannes -
the prizes - that happens on Monday night.
