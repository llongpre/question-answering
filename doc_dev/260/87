One by one the great Maoist shrines have fallen, not to angry mobs bent on
casting out the devils of the past, but to the power of money.
In this 100th anniversary year of the birth of Mao Zedong - he was born on
December 26 - a visitor to his birthplace, to his revolutionary strongholds,
and to the commune that came to symbolise his most erratic phase would find
that celebrations have less to do with the past than they do with cashing in
on the present.
Seventeen years after Mao's death, in September 1976, which ended a decade
of torment known as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, his centenary
has been transformed into a fantasia, even though official celebrations are
lukewarm.
China's reformists seek to draw sustenance from association with this deeply
flawed icon of the revolution without attracting attention to the stark
differences between Mao's policies and their own.
The history of the post-1956 period, during which disaster piled upon
disaster, has become a black hole. Pictorial essays, photographic
exhibitions, biographical material shudder to a halt from the mid-1950s,
before the 'anti-rightist' persecutions of 1957, the catastrophic 'Great
Leap Forward' of 1958 and the madness of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
But these episodes, beyond revision of even the most creative of party
chroniclers, have been put aside for the moment. The anniversary makes 1993
a good news year for the party and for Mao. Thus Mao's place in the
firmament is the stuff of fairy tales and commercialism.
Like tawdry Christian relics, Mao memorabilia, ranging from jewel-encrusted
gold watches with the Great Helmsman's face on the dial, to cigarette
lighters playing the Maoist hymn The East is Red, are being foisted on an
eager public.
It is not the least of paradoxes that in death the man who railed against
money as the root of all evil has spawned one of the greatest cottage
industries of all time. Traffic in 'Maobilia' this year is certain to yield
tens of millions of dollars to China's new-rich entrepreneurs.
At Shaoshan village in the green hills of southern China's Hunan province
where Mao was born, the rebellious son of a well-to-do peasant grain dealer
and money-lender, an oriental Jerusalem has emerged complete with rows of
stalls selling trinkets. The only god is mammon.
In the Yanan redoubt of northern China where the communists took refuge at
the end of the epic Long March of 1935-36, townspeople go about their
business without much regard, it seems, for Mao's teachings. Karaoke bars,
whose synthetic repertoires include an up-tempo version of The East is Red,
mock the austere 'spirit of Yanan'.
Several hundred kilometres to the east at the Dazhai commune, singled out by
Mao in 1964 as a model for a communist utopia, the survivors of the zealotry
that enveloped this rural hamlet during the Cultural Revolution are quietly
getting on with implementing Mr Deng Xiaoping's 'capitalist-style' reforms.
Members of the younger generation are becoming factory hands in a garment
plant, or workers in a joint venture cement works, or miners in the local
coalmine. Unlike their poor fathers who scrabbled in terraced fields to
survive, the sons and daughters of Dazhai equip their wedding nests with
stereophonic sound systems, refrigerators and TVs.
On walls around this village of 500 people, faint outlines of Maoist
Cultural Revolution slogans survive. But superimposed are the bold
exhortations of the Deng era.
Archaeologists of future generations may well track the twists and turns of
20th century China by studying wall slogans piled upon each other, and be
confused by the apparent sudden shift from Mao's emphasis on
collectivisation to Dengist free-market economic policy.
They might also wonder why this tiny settlement in the barren hills of
Shanxi province required a hotel with a dining room capable of seating 800
people. These days, this vast room stands virtually empty, an echo chamber
to past excesses when tens of thousands of cadres, including Mr Deng
himself, were trucked in to 'learn from Dazhai'.
Dazhai's small picture exhibition celebrating its revolutionary past
includes not only photographs of such visitors as Pol Pot and Mr Lee Kuan
Yew of Singapore, but also one of Deng Xiaoping, taken during his
rehabilitation in 1973 before he was purged for a second time during the
Cultural Revolution.
The expression frozen on Mr Deng's face in black and white is one of deep
scepticism. If a picture can be more revealing than words themselves, it
seems that China's future leader was saying that hysteria surrounding the
'learn from Dazhai' campaign was the last thing China needed if it was to be
transformed into a modern state.
Madam Guo, Dazhai's party secretary who gained prominence in the 1960s as
the photogenic leader of the 'Iron Girl Squad' of peasant workers, appears
uncomfortable when conversation turns to the past. Not only were the
commune's production figures exaggerated, but its former headman became a
tame mascot of the revolution, used by the Maoists as a theatrical prop in
remorseless ideological campaigns.
'We started walking forward a bit late because we carried a huge ideological
burden,' she says. 'Now we want to travel light . . . it's been a very
stressful transformation.'
But like government officials the length and breadth of China, Madam Guo was
not about to forsake the party catechism. 'I was a worshipper of Mao, I
respected him very much,' she declares. 'He was a great man.' This latter
observation is the one that drops, like a mantra, most readily from official
lips in this year of 'Good Mao'.
When asked whether Mao, like other towering figures of history, was deeply
flawed, she says: 'We are all deeply flawed . . . after all, he was human.
There is no perfect human being on earth. He was a man not a god.' One
wondered whether such blasphemy might have been possible while the Great
Helmsman was still alive.
In Yanan, some six hours' drive north of Xian, China's ancient capital,
Mao's compound and those of his senior comrades from the 1930s and 1940s are
deserted. Snow lies on the ground and it is bitterly cold, a reminder of the
hardships that were endured during the more than decade-long Yanan period.
It was in their simple cave dwellings, cut into the hills of northern China,
that Maoist ideology was tempered in long days and nights of debate and
discussion. This is where Mao spent more than a decade sheltering from the
nationalists. There was scarcely a more important period in the history of
the Chinese Communist party.
During this time, Mao consolidated his hold on the party, directed Red Army
military operations in a series of stunning victories across China, and
married a saucy young actress from Shanghai named Jiang Qing.
And yet, curiously, in the quarter of a century between 1949 and his death
in 1976, Mao did not return to the place where he had spent more than a
decade sheltering from the nationalists. It was almost as if he wished to
avoid the memories, and perhaps even the ghosts of former close
comrades-in-arms who served with him in happier days.
At Yanan's museum of revolutionary history, one of China's most complete
pictorial records of the early stages of the communist struggle, many of the
smiling revolutionary heroes pictured standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mao
eventually became his victims, either before or during the Cultural
Revolution.
Some, like Liu Shaoqi, the former president, Peng Dehuai, former defence
minister, and He Long, the revolutionary warrior, died miserable deaths
after being persecuted by young revolutionaries unleashed by Mao and his
supporters. Even Zhu De, the brilliant Red Army commander, suffered
persecution and died virtually ignored in July 1976, just two months before
Mao passed away.
There was hardly one of Mao's intimate circle in the Yanan period, including
Zhou Enlai, who went on to be foreign minister and premier, and Deng
Xiaoping, who emerged unscathed in the post-revolution era.
Not one of those pictured in the Yanan gallery, with the possible exception
of Kang Sheng, could possibly have predicted that the glorious victory in
1949 would have produced the nightmare of the decades 1956-1976. The shadowy
Kang became Mao's secret police chief and evil genius behind the mass
campaigns and persecutions of the Cultural Revolution.
At Yanan university, like countless institutions across China, the
department of political science has been evaluating Mao's contribution to
Chinese history. The results of these judgments have followed a predictable
course, adhering to the party's own assessment made in the early 1980s that
the chairman had made 'mistakes', but on the whole his contribution to the
revolution far outweighed those errors.
Mr Feng, director of Yanan's political science faculty, perhaps came as
close as any Chinese official might to an admission that more time was
needed before an unexpurgated version of Mao's life and works might be
possible. 'The time is not ripe yet for a complete assessment,' he said. 'He
was a very complicated man and revolutionary.'
His colleague, Mr Li Xin Chang, added: 'All in all Mao made quite a few
serious mistakes. He was a successful leader in wartime, but he was not so
successful in peacetime.' There would appear to be ample scope for future
Chinese historians.
In Beijing, the custodians of the Central Party Archives have been churning
out Mao literature to mark the centenary, while studiously avoiding
controversy. Five books have been published, including a compendium of his
Selected Works drawn from Volumes 1-4 dealing with the (safe) pre-1949
period; a digest of his military speeches; a non-controversial biography of
the 1893-1949 era; an idealised pictorial essay; and a sugary tribute from
former associates, including his bodyguards.
Likewise, Mao's speeches captured on tapes and laser discs and distributed
in their thousands to mark the anniversary do not trespass beyond the 'Great
Wall of Silence' of 1956. This was the year before the 'Hundred Flowers
Campaign' of 1957, which led to the anti-rightist purges and disastrous
'Great Leap Forward' in economic policy, which left in its wake terrible
famine and hardship.
Mr Wang Yuyao, head of the Mao Zedong Research Group at the Central Party
Archives, was hazy about when there might be further volumes of Mao's works
covering the period after 1957 to his death in 1976, saying merely that an
enormous amount of preparation was required.
But the last entry in volume five of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong
(published in 1977), by recalling his famous statement that 'all
reactionaries are paper tigers', shows that much of his thinking was not as
prescient as his followers liked to believe. 'US imperialism has not yet
been overthrown and it has the atom bomb, but I believe it too is a paper
tiger and will be overthrown,' Mao wrote in November 1957. Unlike
Nostradamus, Mao was not in the habit of saying when his predictions might
come true.
Mr Wang made no attempt to disguise his organisation's mission in this 'good
news year' of the Mao centenary. 'We want to make the best use of Mao's good
thoughts,' he declared. 'Psychologically speaking, the masses would rather
think of Mao in a positive way for the good things he has done for the
people.'
