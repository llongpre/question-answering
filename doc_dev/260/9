   A recent powerful earthquake and an unfounded
prediction of a devastating temblor have spurred many Cambodian
refugees to leave Southern California, members of the community
said Friday.
   Fears have been widespread in the community since a quake Oct. 1
that measured 5.9 on the Richter scale, and were revived by recent
publicity about a purported prediction by the 16th-century seer
Nostradamus that Los Angeles would be destroyed by a temblor.
   ``How many people are leaving for this I really don't know. But
people are talking about it. People are leaving, are scared,'' said
Than Pok, executive director of United Cambodian Community, a
center for immigrant education and vocational training that serves
about 10,000 people a year.
   One reported estimate put the number of Cambodians who have fled
at 2,000.
   ``My real gut feeling _ 1,000 may be more realistic,'' Than said.
   An estimated 35,000 Cambodian refugees live in Southern
California, mainly in Long Beach. It is the largest Cambodian
community in the nation. Most came after the Vietnamese invasion of
Cambodia in 1979, Than said.
   Until last October there had been no significant earthquake or
other natural disaster in the Los Angeles area in the time since
the Cambodians arrived.
   The reaction to the October quake is based in Cambodian culture,
Than said. ``The Cambodian culture is a mixture of Buddhism,
Hinduism and animistic belief. They believe in the super (natural)
power, the storm, the earthquake, the fire, the flood. So this
theory is in the back of their mind. They think they cannot
control; they just fear,'' he said.
   Ben Kelly, director of the Department of Social Services in
Fresno County, 200 miles northwest of Los Angeles, said that 343
people of Cambodian ethnicity have been added to the welfare lists
since last October.
   ``That is unusual growth,'' he said, although he did not know
whether quake fears were behind the influx.
   Namany Keam, operator of the private Cambodian Translation
Bureau, said she did not know anyone who had moved, but there has
been a great deal of talk about people leaving to join friends and
relatives in such places as Arizona or Washington.
   ``Everybody is scared. Some of them just move. ... They'd rather
go to the cold states than the earthquake state,'' she said.
   Impetus to the exodus apparently also came from publicity about
a video, ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which a filmmaker
interpreted a vague prediction by Nostradamus to mean Los Angeles
would be destroyed by an earthquake in May.
   The purported prediction was dismissed both by scientists and
experts on Nostradamus.
   ``Cambodian culture really believes that ... somone can tell the
future,'' Ms. Keam said. ``When they talk about the fortune teller
in the newspaper and TV, they really believe.''
   Than agreed that such fears can be triggered by things such as
children being put through earthquake drills at school and the
frequent discussion of earthquake preparedness in California.
   ``This kind of thing, unless you make an effort to communicate
to people, they're never going to understand it,'' he said.
   Than said he wasn't certain whether the refugees were leaving
permanently.
   Vora Kanthoul, associate executive director of United Cambodian
Community's Orange County office in Santa Ana, said, ``There are
some fears around. To actually leave because of that fear, there's
only a small percentage.''
   He cautioned that exact estimates would be unreliable because
there is also migration north for economic reasons.
   ``People are moving. Quite a few businessmen are going up there
because of the opportunity, because Fresno, as far as the Cambodian
population, is growing,'' he said.
