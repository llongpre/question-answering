   Nancy Reagan's stargazer hopes to keep her
White House consulting link until the Reagans return to California,
but says she's troubled by being in the spotlight and by the
``kooks'' in her business.
   Joan Quigley, so discreet about her work that one of her
high-society acquaintances said she ``didn't know anything about
this astrology bit,'' contends her role has been greatly
exaggerated.
   ``Mrs. Reagan is a very able woman and is very nice to deal
with,'' Quigley said. ``She uses astrology constructively.''
   But after the Reagans leave the White House next January,
``there's no way'' she'd sign up a subsequent president as a
client, Quigley said in an interview.
   ``After the end of this year, I will never do anything connected
with any U.S. president or his wife or anybody again,'' she said
Tuesday. Quigley has been besieged by reporters and photographers
since Sunday's disclosure of her high-level consultations.
   The socialite and heiress, author of three books on astrology,
was a regular guest on Merv Griffin's television talk show from
1973 to 1985, making astrological predictions. She met Mrs. Reagan
through Griffin, a longtime friend of the Reagans who shares a July
6 birthday with the first lady.
   But despite her television appearances, Quigley has largely
evaded public scrutiny.
   ``She is one of the few I've met astrologically who doesn't seek
or want publicity,'' said Robert Cooper, executive secretary of the
Tempe, Ariz.-based American Federation of Astrologers. He calls her
``well-versed in classical astrology.''
   Quigley, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vassar College, said she
developed her interest in astrology from her mother and her disdain
for sensationalism from her father, the late John B. Quigley, a
prominent San Francisco Republican and hotelier. His view of it as
a bizarre profession caused her to keep her work secret early in
her career.
   The publicity of the past few days, she said, ``is very
embarrassing to me.''
   ``I've been put in a terrible situation because I'm an ethical
person and I don't talk about my clients. But I had to come forward
to show that I am a serious person with a scientific approach to
astrology.''
   She declines to discuss her handful of clients but is quick to
criticize pop astrologers and syndicated horoscope writers she
regards as the ``kooks'' and charlatans of her profession.
   ``How can it be possible that the same thing is happening to
one-twelfth of the world's population on a given day? They give
astrology a superstitious name,'' Quigley said.
   Quigley said she offered her services to the Reagans in the 1980
campaign, then signed on as a consultant for an undisclosed fee in
1981, after Reagan was shot and Mrs. Reagan's concerns about his
scheduling were heightened.
   Quigley said she has spoken with Mrs. Reagan this week but would
not reveal her reaction to the flap. A spokeswoman for the first
lady has said she will continue to use astrological portents in
shaping the president's schedule.
   Reagan, according to the astrologer, has a ``fabulous'' chart.
``He's an Aquarian, and all our greatest presidents except for
Washington have been Aquarians: Lincoln, FDR and Reagan,'' she said.
