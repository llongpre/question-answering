   Soviet scientists are trying to determine why the
Armenian earthquake toppled whole cities and killed more than 40,000
people. One U.S. expert blamed much of the devastation on poorly
constructed buildings.
   Soviet seismologist Igor Nersesov told a news conference Saturday
a commission was sent to the Armenian city of Leninakan to determine
why three-quarters of the buildings in the city of 250,000 tumbled
when construction supposedly was sufficient to withstand some
shaking.
   Wednesday's quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and its
epicenter was not far from the surface. A similar earthquake in
southern California would have killed about 1,000 people, acting
state geologist Brian Tucker told The Associated Press in California
on Friday.
   Tucker, who spent two years in Armenia on a research project,
blamed the high death toll in Armenia on local construction, which
tends to be loosely connected, unreinforced concrete slabs in the
city or adobe in the villages.
   Nersesov told reporters in Moscow that ``with a duly organized
scientific system of observation and research, we could have'''
predicted the quake.
   He said a team of seismic experts also had been sent to Armenia
in an attempt to predict aftershocks.
   The latest seismic records for northwestern Armenia were
destroyed in the quake along with the Institute of Seismology in
Leninakan, Nersesov said. The institute had been researching
earthquake-proof construction techniques.
   Like Western scientists, the Leninakan researchers were hampered
by the difficulty of testing their theories. The University of
California at Irvine recently built a complex engineering laboratory
with the ability to simulate earthquakes.
   Nersesov said construction in the Leninakan area should have been
sufficient to withstand the force of an earthquake rated 8 on the
12-point Soviet scale of potential earthquake damage. That level is
described in reference books as ``destructive,'' causing ``cracks on
sharp slopes and wet slopes. Monuments are moved or turned over.
Houses are considerably damaged. ''
   Officials say Wednesday's quake was closer to a 10 on the
12-point scale.
   In answer to a question, Nersesov also said buildings are not
always constructed according to regulation.
