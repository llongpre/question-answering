   An earthquake more deadly than last week's
jolt is 50 percent likely near San Francisco, and a catastrophic
``big one'' is at least 60 percent probable in Southern California
by the year 2018, scientists say.
   Overall odds for such quakes, which could kill thousands of
people, were listed in a 1988 U.S. Geological Survey study. They
remain unchanged by the Oct. 17 upheaval that claimed at least 63
lives in the San Francisco Bay area, said USGS geophysicist Jim
Dieterich, the report's lead author.
   The report predicted a 30 percent chance by 2018 for a magnitude
6.5 quake on the segment of the San Andreas that caused last week's
quake. That jolt measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, suggesting the
forecast was conservative.
   The earthquake ``makes one realize these forecasts are serious
and reliable,'' said California Institute of Technology geologist
Kerry Sieh, one of 12 co-authors of the study, which represented a
scientific consensus.
   The report said a repeat of San Francisco's magnitude 8.3 great
earthquake of 1906 is less than 10 percent within 30 years. The
1906 quake ruptured the San Andreas Fault and killed at least 2,500
people, according to recent studies.
   The next magnitude 7 major quake will be much more devastating
than the recent jolt because it will be located closer to the city
on either the San Andreas or Hayward faults, Dieterich and others
said.
   ``The chance of another destructive or more destructive
earthquake in the Bay area is still high, and the chances in
Southern California are even higher,'' Sieh said.
   The study listed overall 30-year probabilities of 50 percent for
a magnitude 7 quake in the Bay area, and 60 percent to perhaps 70
percent odds that the ``big one'' measuring 7.5 to 8.3 on the
Richter scale will rupture the San Andreas Fault in Southern
California.
   Last week's quake raised the chance of an earthquake on the San
Andreas Fault between Los Gatos and Daly City, closer to San
Francisco. It slightly lowered the chance of a quake on the segment
south of Los Gatos, which is where last week's quake was centered.
   But the overall odds for a magnitude 7 quake in the Bay area
remain 50-50 by 2018, Dieterich calculated.
   A magnitude 7 earthquake on either the San Andreas or the
Hayward faults closer to San Francisco ``would be much more
devastating than last week's earthquake,'' Dieterich said Wednesday
by telephone from Menlo Park.
   ``Damage for a Hayward Fault magnitude 7 earthquake would be
comparable to a great earthquake occurring along the San Andreas
Fault in Southern California,'' he said. ``The Hayward runs right
through Oakland, Berkeley and the rest of the East Bay.''
   A 1980 report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
estimated a magnitude 7.4 quake on the Hayward Fault could kill
3,000 to 7,000 people, hospitalize 13,000 to 27,000 and cause $44
billion in damage. No estimate exists for a magnitude 7 quake.
   The same report said a repeat of the 1906 catastrophe could kill
3,000 to 11,000 people, hospitalize 12,000 to 44,000 and cause $38
billion in damage. A quake of magnitude 8.3 in Southern California
could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people, hospitalize 12,000 to 55,000 and
cause $17 billion in damage.
   ``Everybody who lives in California should be ready for an
earthquake at any time, and that means tomorrow,'' said Don
Anderson, director of Caltech's seismological laboratory. ``Just
because someone says there is a 30 percent probability of a big
earthquake in the next 30 years doesn't mean it won't happen
tomorrow.''
