   Astrologer Joan Quigley said Thursday that the
star-gazing advice she gave Nancy Reagan during Ronald Reagan's
presidency influenced the course of history in big ways and small,
even steering the president away from his ``Evil Empire'' view of
the Soviet Union.
   In a book giving her version of her eight-year relationship with
the Reagans _ first disclosed in 1988 by fired Reagan adviser
Donald Regan _ Ms. Quigley asserted that she set the times some
presidential events would occur down to the minute and sometimes
even to the second.
   When Reagan announced his selection of Anthony Kennedy for a
seat on the Supreme Court on Nov. 11, 1987, she chose 25 seconds
after 11:32 a.m. EST as the moment for the announcement. ``A man
with a stopwatch'' gave Reagan the signal for proceeding, she wrote.
   She said she also delayed the timing of Reagan's first cancer
operation in 1985 by three days and dictated when Mrs. Reagan's
mastectomy would take place.
   Ms. Quigley says Reagan knew of her influence on his wife and
gave her a thank-you kiss when he finally met her.
   Mrs. Reagan, in her memoirs, ``My Turn,'' wrote last year that
while Ms. Quigley was ``helpful and comforting ... a kind of
therapist,'' she had influence solely on Reagan's schedule.
   ``No political decision was ever made based on it,'' she said.
   However, Ms. Quigley said that before Reagan's first summit with
Mikhail Gorbachev, she worked three hours to persuade Mrs. Reagan
that her husband could trust the Soviet leader. She said she
``battled her to the mat'' to get Reagan's view of Gorbachev
changed.
   ``The placement of his ruler, Mercury, in the 10th house of
power and position convinces me that Gorbachev came to power ...
because of his high degree of intelligence,'' she said she told the
first lady. ``It symbolizes to me that despite his Russian training
and origins, he has the instincts of a humanitarian.''
   Finally, the president's wife replied, ``I know you are right,''
she said.
   ``Through Nancy, I had a direct line to the president,'' Ms.
Quigley wrote.
   ``I was responsible for timing all press conferences, most
speeches, the State of the Union addresses, the takeoffs and
landings of Air Force One. I picked the time of Ronald Reagan's
debate with (Jimmy) Carter and the two debates with Walter Mondale;
all extended trips abroad as well as the shorter trips and one-day
excursions, the announcement that Reagan would run for a second
term, briefings for all the summits except Moscow, although I
selected the time to begin the Moscow trip.
   ``I timed congressional arm-twisting, the second inaugural oath
of office, the announcement of Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court
nomination.''
   Ms. Quigley said her most tedious work was analyzing Reagan's
horoscope ``on an hour by hour basis.''
   Birch Lane Press said Thursday's publication date for Ms.
Quigley's book _ ``What Does Joan Say?'' _ was selected by the
astrologer.
   Vassar-educated and a San Francisco socialite, Ms. Quigley is
the author of three books on astrology. Her form of astrology goes
beyond sun signs and deals with the moon and all eight planets as
well, according to her publisher.
   Ms. Quigley wrote that she did not intend to write a book, even
after Regan disclosed her role when he wrote his memoirs as White
House chief of staff. But she reconsidered, she said, when Mrs.
Reagan's book came out last year.
   ``It reads like fiction and much of it is evasive,'' she wrote
of Mrs. Reagan's account. ``What she has left out would fill a
book.''
   At the time Regan told of Mrs. Reagan's use of an astrologer,
Reagan spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president had emphasized
``that he made no policy decisions based on astrology.''
   Ms. Quigley's account differs.
   She wrote that Reagan asked his wife to ask her about going to
Reykjavik, Iceland, for his second summit with Gorbachev. Reagan
and Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``followed my advice to
negotiate there as long and as hard as possible, and following my
advice they stayed later than planned.''
   ``Ronnie asked Nancy, `What does Joan say?' when he wanted to
know when the Irangate ordeal would be over,'' she wrote. ``And he
phoned to thank me personally for a letter written at the end of
Irangate, in which I described myself as his astrologer, addresing
him as `Dear Ronnie' and signing it `Joan.'''
   Ms. Quigley was discreet about how much she had been paid for
her efforts _ just as Mrs. Reagan was. The astrologer said she
orginally was paid by the hour for time spent on the phone with
Mrs. Reagan and time spent in preparation.
   She said when she raised her fee for other clients she kept Mrs.
Reagan's at the old level. Finally, she charged Mrs. Reagan a fixed
monthly fee ``because she needed much more of my time than she
could afford. This was very generous on my part.''
