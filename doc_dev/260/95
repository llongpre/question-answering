   A national early warning system for
earthquakes could provide emergency planners with crucial extra
seconds in a disaster, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological
Survey said Tuesday.
   The federal agency has proposed a national network of 150
interconnected seismometers to detect ground motion and relay
immediate information about earthquakes, including predictions of
when and where the most shaking will occur.
   The network would issue bulletins telling emergency planners how
many seconds they had before shock waves from the quake would reach
them. Those seconds could be enough to turn off power systems, issue
public warnings and make emergency response plans before
communications are cut off, said Thomas Heaton of the geological
survey's office in asadena, Calif.
   The bulletins would help planners know where emergency services
would be needed most and provide an estimate of what kind of damage
the quake would cause.
   The network also would estimate the probability that an
earthquake is a foreshock and would be followed by another, bigger
quake, Heaton said in a briefing for science writers at Cornell
University.
   Heaton said early warning systems are used in Japan to predict
tidal waves after an earthquake and to turn off gas and
transportation systems when a quake occurs. One system shuts down
Japan's high-speed ``bullet train'' to prevent an accident if the
train's tracks were bent in an earthquake.
   Although there are 1,600 seismograph stations in the United
States, they are intended to locate earthquakes _ even very small
ones _ and not to provide information about them. The existing
system records only the up and down motion of the earth, not its
side-to-side shaking, and can measure only a limited range of shock
waves, Heaton said. Major quakes, like last month's California
quake, are off the scale.
   The existing system is also very slow, Heaton said. The
information it provides is typically one or two days behind, and in
a large sequence of shocks that delay could become as long as
several months.
   Heaton said a detection system would not have reduced deaths in
the California earthquake but might have been able to reduce some
injuries by giving people enough warning to get out of the way of
falling objects.
   ``We need to use whatever creative strategies there are to
minimize the risk,'' he said.
   After the California earthquake, three seismometers were
installed to measure aftershocks from the quake. The seismometers
sent about a 20-second warning of aftershocks to emergency workers
who were digging through rubble.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has agreed to fund 60 of the
centers recommended by the geological survey in the eastern and
central part of the United States, at a cost of about $5 million. No
funding has yet been found for the remaining centers, Heaton said.
   ``Many people have the impression that whatever can be done is
being done,'' Heaton said. ``That is far from the true situation.''
   Heaton's talk was part of a four-day briefing at Cornell
University sponsored by the Council for the Advancement of Science
Writing.
