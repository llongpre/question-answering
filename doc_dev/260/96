   The devastating earthquake that killed
hundreds in northern California vividly recalls the catastrophic
quake and fire that laid waste to San Francisco in 1906.
   Quakes are almost commonplace in California, with that state and
western Nevada experiencing 90 percent of the tremors recorded in
this country according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
   But when the rare major quake comes, as it did in the nation's
second-deadliest quake on Tuesday, serious damage can result as
well as death and injury.
   And while the West Coast feels the earth shake more often,
shocks can strike any part of the nation.
   The new quake registered at 6.9 on the Richter scale and was on
the notorious San Andreas Fault. That reading made it the
sixth-most powerful quake to strike California this century, and
the mos powerful since a 7.0 quake centered in Eureka in 1980.
   Such a quake can cause severe damage, with each increase of one
whole number meaning an increase of 10 times in strength.
   Tuesday's devastating quake still is well short of the 1906 San
Francisco quake, however, which was estimated at 8.3 on the scale.
That disaster killed more than 700 people, largely in fires which
swept the city in the wake of the tremor.
   California and Alaska are subject to many quakes because they
rest on what is called the Ring of Fire, a region of volcanoes and
earthquake-prone lands circling the Pacific Ocean.
   This ring is caused by the movement of the giant plates that
underlie the land and oceans of the earth. Plates move gradually,
stresses build up over time and then are released in quakes.
   San Francisco sits astride the San Andreas fault, a crack in the
earth where the Pacific plate is slowly sliding north compared with
the rest of California, which rests on the North American Plate. It
was the same fault that instigated the 1906 tremor.
   While the 1906 disaster is burned into American memory, this
country has been relatively fortunate, compared to other nations,
in terms of earthquake disasters.
   The 25,000 deaths reported in Armenia a year ago are fresh in
memory, and China had an estimated 650,000 deaths in a violent
quake in 1976. Japan too has suffered many deaths in historic
quakes, as have Iran, Turkey, Nicaragua, Peru, Chile and other
nations.
   The 1906 San Francisco quake was the largest American death
toll, although at least two other events were stronger in terms of
the Richter scale.
   Here is a rundown of other major earthquakes in American history
as recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey:
   _New Madrid, Mo., was shaken by three quakes in 1811-1812
estimated at 8.4 to 8.7 on the Richter scale, but damage and
casualties were light because the region had a relatively small
population at the time. These quakes were felt as far away as
Boston and New York.
   _Prince William Sound, Alaska, was pounded by a quake rated at
8.4 on the Richter scale, on March 27, 1964. In this century only
one quake, in Chile in 1960, has been stronger. There were 131
deaths and extensive damage in Alaska.
   _On Nov. 18, 1867, the Virgin Islands were shaken by a magnitude
7.5 quake also felt in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
Waves as large as 20 feet were generated.
   _In the same area a 7.5 temblor shook the Mona passage near
Puerto Rico on Oct. 11, 1918. Some 116 people died, many in the
giant wave generated by the quake.
   _On Aug. 17, 1959, a quake rated at 7.3 struck Hebgen Lake,
Mont., and was felt from Seattle to North Dakota to Utah. Extensive
damage was reported and 28 people died.
   _Olympia, Wash., was struck by a 7.1 quake on April 13, 1949,
killing eight people and causing extensive damage in Washington and
Oregon.
   _There was a quake rated 7.0 at Borah Peak, Idaho, on Oct. 25,
1983. It was widely felt but only two people were killed.
   _Coalinga, Calif., was the focus of a 6.7 magnitude quake on May
2, 1983, injuring 45 people and causing $31 million in damage.
   _On Aug. 31, 1886 Charleston, S.C., suffered a 6.6 magnitude
quake killing 60 people. This tremor was felt as far away as
Boston, Milwaukee and Havana, Cuba.
   _A quake measured at 6.6 also did severe damage to the San
Fernando Valley of California on Feb. 9, 1971, killing 65 people.
