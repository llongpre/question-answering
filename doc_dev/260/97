<CAPTION>  Map; MAP: Jenny Anderson -- Mercury News; MAPPING A DANGER ZONE. The world's
biggest earthquakes occur in subduction zones -- places where one plate of the
Earth's crust dives under another. Scientists are finding evidence that such a
zone has caused great quakes along the Northern California coast.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  New evidence indicates that a giant earthquake measuring from 7.8 to more than
9 on the magnitude scale could rock the Northern California coast, affecting
an area much farther south than previously believed.;     The culprit lurks
about 60 miles offshore: the Cascadia subduction zone, a giant fault that runs
more than 700 miles from southern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      Along this broad zone the ocean bottom is slipping beneath the continent,
sometimes sticking and building up strain that could suddenly spring free in a
quake.;    Scientists have warned for several years that the Pacific Northwest
could be in for a devastating earthquake, based on evidence that six or seven
great quakes have struck there over the past 3,500 years.;    Now they're
turning up similar evidence in Northern California, at both Humboldt Bay and
at the mouth of the Eel River.;    Taken together, the studies in southern
Washington and California point to a giant earthquake, or a rapid-fire series
of great earthquakes, that struck a long stretch of the coast around 1700,
researchers reported Tuesday at a meeting of seismologists and geologists.;   
But they said it is impossible to predict from the scant data when the next
one might occur.;    "It could happen in the near future," said Gary Carver, a
geology professor at Humboldt State University who has studied the fault zone
since 1983. "It may not happen for a very long time. We don't know.";   
Scientists do know the Cascadia zone is the largest fault structure in the
lower 48 states, similar to zones that have produced the biggest earthquakes
in history, such as the magnitude 9.2 quake that struck Alaska on Good Friday
in 1964.;    That quake killed 131 people and caused tidal-wave damage as far
south as Crescent City.;    In this type of quake the coast typically drops 10
feet or more while the ocean bottom springs up, triggering tsunamis, or tidal
waves.;    Dating through fossils;    Coastal forests and marshes are
submerged, drowned and covered with layers of mud that protect them from
decay. By digging up and dating these fossilized plants, researchers can
estimate when the last big earthquake occurred.;    Carver and his colleagues,
including geologist Samuel Clarke of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
said they've uncovered five such quakes in the fossil record over the past
1,700 years, the last one in about the year 1700.;    They also dug trenches
along the Little Salmon Fault, which runs from the ocean bottom up onto the
land just south of Eureka, and found evidence for at least three big quakes --
including one about 1700.;    It's possible, they said, that the Little Salmon
could move by itself, creating a quake of about magnitude 7.8.;    But they
think it's more likely that Little Salmon quakes are triggered by bigger
tremors on the subduction zone off the coast. If that is the case, a quake
could measure 8 or even 9 on the magnitude scale, depending on how much of the
zone ruptured.;    Bolstering their case are stories told by several coastal
Indian tribes about a giant earthquake, accompanied by tsunamis and a sudden
submergence of the coastline.;    Carver's wife, Deborah, dug up one such tale
in the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. Told by a
Yurok woman, Ann of Espu, it was recorded on a gramophone disc by an
anthropologist at the turn of the century and titled "How Prairie Became
Ocean.";    Specifics from stories;  Carver said these stories were so
detailed that the researchers were able to find the specific places mentioned
-- and in some cases, they discovered the fossils of drowned trees and other
traces of past earthquakes.;    Now, he said, the goal is to date these
earthquakes more precisely by comparing patterns in the tree rings to patterns
from trees of known age, with their distinctive markings reflecting years of
drought, disease or healthy growth.;    These studies, which could narrow the
quake dates to a particular year or even a particular season, will take
several years, he said.;    In southern Washington, Brian Atwater of the USGS
in Seattle said he has been able to date the most recent great earthquake to
within a couple of decades by doing radiocarbon dating of the rings of
fossilized Sitka spruce trees.;    This method places the most recent quake
between 1680 and 1720, he said. Within this time, quakes hit the mouth of the
Copalis River and Willapa Bay, 30 miles apart, leaving behind the sandy traces
of a tidal wave.;    There's no way of telling if both places were hit by the
same quake, Atwater said, but either possibility is sobering: Either a single
"apocalyptic" quake of magnitude 9 struck the coast, or a series of magnitude
8's may have hit in what he calls a "decade of terror."  </TEXT>
