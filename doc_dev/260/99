   President Reagan refused to disavow the
practice of astrology on Tuesday, saying he did not know enough
about it to say whether or not there is ``something to it.''
   But Reagan also insisted that no changes were made in his
schedule because of first lady Nancy Reagan's dealings with an
astrologer.
   ``We made no decisions on it and we're not binding our lives to
this,'' Reagan told reporters in a short question-and-answer
session in the White House briefing room.
   The president then quickly added, ``And I don't mean to offend
anyone who does believe in it, or engages in it seriously.''
   But asked if he believed in astrology, the president paused
before replying.
   ``I don't guide my life by it, but I won't answer the question
the other way because I don't know enough about it to say, is there
something to it,'' he then replied.
   It was the most detailed response given by the president to the
report that his wife used stargazing to help formulate his schedule
and make decisions about other White House activities.
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan revealed the
practice in his book, ``For the Record,'' and White House officials
have confirmed that the first lady has ``an interest'' in following
the stars.
   Reagan offered a sometimes rambling defense of his wife's
activity, saying that the experience of the March 30, 1981,
assassination attempt contributed to her reliance on advice
provided by a person, whom he only identified as being ``a friend.''
   Reagan said the ``friend'' called the first lady after the
shooting and told her that it would have been helpful to have known
what the president had planned to do that day because ``all the
signs were bad.''
   ``That was a trauma that didn't g away easily,'' Reagan said.
   In an apparent explanation of his wife's dealings with the
astrologer, he added: ``And when suddenly things of the same kind _
just for a short period there _ when I was booked for something of
the same kind where the accident occurred, why she would ask, `What
does it look like now?' And no changes were ever made on the basis
of whether I did or did not conduct this.''
   The president was asked whether he believed that based upon a
warning from an astrologer, he could have changed what had happened.
   ``No, this friend thought that had I been told of _ that that
was supposed to be a horrendous time for me, that I might have done
something. Well, we didn't,'' he replied.
   While the Reagans have never identified the astrologer, San
Francisco heiress Joan Quigley has confirmed that she has spoken
with the first couple on the subject. Miss Quigley has authored
several books on astrology.
   Asked if he had allowed astrology to be used in setting his
schedule, Reagan responded, ``It didn't go on, and this whole thing
is built around an incident in which it is printed that this had to
do with scheduling of one of my operations _ Well, it didn't happen
that way at all.''
   Regan, in his book, relates a conversation he had with the first
lady in which she spoke of a possible delay in the president's July
1985 colon cancer surgery. The former chief of staff said he feared
the first lady was speaking of a possible delay because she wanted
to consult first with her astrologer.
   ``Nancy Reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant
powers of this woman,'' Regan wrote.
