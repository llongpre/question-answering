<HEADLINE>  PROFESSOR DOOM
CAPITALISM WILL FALL BY 2000, BATRA SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The India-born economics professor at Southern Methodist University has
been warning of economic doom and gloom through books and lectures for more
than a decade. And so far, a few of his predictions have been close to the
mark.;    In his 1987 book, "The Great Depression of 1990," a New York Times
No. 1 best seller, Batra predicted a recession would begin in 1990, but he
also said it would fester into the worst depression the world has ever known.;
   He hasn't wavered since.;    "The depression will not be confined to the
economy. It will be a depression in every walk of life," said the 46-year-old
Batra, who's been dubbed "Dr. Doom" by the news media.;    Batra's 1987
prophecy and a follow-up book a year later called "Surviving the Great
Depression of 1990" foresee worldwide unemployment, deflation, stock market
crashes and bank failures over the next six years. The end result will be the
collapse of capitalism, according to Batra.;    "People think capitalism is
invincible, but that is the same thing they said about communism," he said in
a recent interview.;    In 1978, Batra wrote a book entitled "The Downfall of
Capitalism and Communism." The book documented how both systems would fall by
the year 2000.;    Publishers laughed at the notion then. But after the Iron
Curtain and Berlin Wall collapsed and communism lost out to perestroika, few
were laughing.;    Nonetheless, Batra's method of forecasting has drawn sharp
scrutiny from mainstream economists.;    Batra said his forecasts were born
from the teachings of Indian mentor P.R. Sarkar, a spiritualist whose writings
outline a history of social cycles dominating history. Sarkar, who died last
year, headed an Indian sect called the Path of Bliss, some of whose followers
have been known to take part in rites such as dancing with human skulls.;   
Batra said the cycles show history repeats itself every 60 years. The 1980s
followed the same path of the 1920s preceding the Great Depression, he said.; 
  Leonard Silk, an economist and columnist for The New York Times, called
Batra "a bright guy and . . . by-and-large a good economist.";    "But on the
business of whether or not civilization is collapsing, my feeling is that it
is in the realm of science fiction," he said.;    Allen Sinai, the chief
economist for The Boston Co. and an economics professor at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Brandeis University, agreed.;    "The start of
this downfall is very severe and there are lots of similarities between now
and the Great Depression," Sinai said. "But the power the government policy
makers have over maintaining the growth in the economies is too strong.";   
Batra predicted unemployment would reach between 10- and 15 percent by the end
of 1991. By 1995, the country will be plagued with "soup and kitchen lines
worse than in the 1930s," he said.;    "The people who have lost their jobs,
the white collar positions as well as the entry level positions, understand
that this is very serious," he said.;    "More and more banks will begin to
fail," he added. "The insurance industry will fall apart and there will be an
increase in crime, drugs and greed . . .";    Batra maintains it will be just
as gloomy overseas.;    "The fall in the Japanese stock market will pale in
comparison to the real estate crash in Japan," Batra said. "Their overly
inflated land values will come crashing down some time this year. Banks will
begin to fail and panic will shoot through their economy."  </TEXT>
