It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Budget and trade deficits 
soared -- but so did gross national product. Americans spent more than ever but 
our industry became less competitive. Corporate America went on a debt-financed 
merger spree -- and reported record earnings. The United States enjoyed record 
economic expansion -- and became a debtor nation for the first time since World 
War I. Incomes boomed, homeless filled the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s were a time of economic paradox, not just here, but worldwide. 
Communism failed, capitalism triumphed -- but only if you didn't count the 
Third World. The world economy grew more integrated than ever before but 
protectionism also increased. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the '90s? Unsettled and cloudy. The world economy contains the 
seeds of a great boom and a great depression; the '90s could see either or 
both. Technological progress, European integration and rising standards of 
living around the Pacific Rim could bring back the good old 1960s. This was 
when Americans thought average, single-income families could -- and should -- 
own their own homes while watching their standards of living rise every year. 
</P>
<P>
That would be nice, but the world economy is as likely to belly-up as boom. 
International cooperation can help deter trouble but the outlook is complicated 
by current relationships. With U.S. prosperity still dependent on an inflow of 
Japanese capital that many Americans resent, and tensions between the two 
Pacific partners ratcheting up year by year, the United States and Japan could 
waste the 1990s in futile but expensive trade wars. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Western Europe could be too busy picking up the pieces in the East 
to care much about the rest of the world. An isolationist Europe might restrict 
imports from both the United States and Asia. Instead of one dynamic world 
economy, we could end up with three stagnant, quarreling blocs. 
</P>
<P>
One other question mark hovers over the future. In most of the world, the '80s 
were the decade of Thatcherism -- Reaganomics without the tax cuts. The basic 
idea was to make life better for the rich in the belief that this prosperity 
would "trickle down." Maybe. Historians generally (not universally; historians, 
like economists, glory in contradiction) blame 1920s speculation for the Great 
Depression of the '30s. The rich had plenty of money to invest, but the poor 
and middle class had no money to buy. 
</P>
<P>
There was more. International finance resembled a giant Ponzi scheme. Germany 
borrowed from the United States to pay debts to Britain and France. Britain and 
France used their German money to pay U.S. war debt. But when the crash came, 
Americans had no more money for Germany. Without U.S. money, Germany collapsed. 
Without German money, France and Britain could not pay debts. 
</P>
<P>
Some financial historians warn that we are in danger of repeating this dismal 
story, with Japan lending money to the United States so that we can service 
foreign debt -- the largest, fastest-growing debt in the world. If Tokyo stock 
and real-estate markets should falter -- and there are plenty of reasons why 
they should -- Japanese money would dry up overnight. The shock could bring 
down America's banking system, cause a new Great Depression and leave the 
dollar trading one-for-one with the peso. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well. History is not only bunk, the State Department tells us it's over. 
Happy New Year.
