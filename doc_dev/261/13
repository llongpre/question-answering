'It still seems probable that we should be able to prevent serious
depressions by preventing the inflations which regularly precede them, but
there is little we can do to cure them, once they have set in. The time to
worry about depressions is, unfortunately, when they are furthest from the
minds of most people' - Friedrich Hayek, The Monetary Framework, The
Constitution of Liberty
If Hayek was right, the world economy is already doomed. For an inflationary
reduction in the purchasing power of money has been a feature of the world
economy since the second world war, while a depression is certainly not far
from the minds of people today. On the contrary, many people write as if a
global depression were a fact, not just a fear.
The dangers were well described by the American economist, Irving Fisher in
his analysis of debt deflation in the 1930s*. Over-indebtedness and asset
price deflation can lead to debt liquidation, to the collapse of banks and
the decline in bank deposits, to a fall in prices and to a rise in real
rates of interest. If a fixed exchange rate system and an outbreak of global
protectionism is added to the list, deflation can readily become global.
Yet it is not at all obvious why a global depression should happen and quite
clear that nothing like one has happened yet. The gross domestic product of
the industrial countries as a group continues to rise every year. There is
no resemblance between this and the Great Depression: between 1929 and 1933
US real gross national product fell by 30 per cent, while German GDP
declined by 24 per cent between 1929 and 1932. Contemporary examples of
comparable collapses are not to be found among the industrial countries, but
in eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Helped by the decision to break the fixed link between sterling and gold in
1931, UK GDP fell by only 5 per cent between 1929 and 1931 and was back
above 1929 levels by 1934. Thus the performance of the UK economy during the
present recession does merit comparison with that during the Great
Depression. But there is an important difference: with a decline in GDP of 4
per cent between the second quarters of 1990 and 1992, the UK has suffered
far more than any other leading economy this time. In the Great Depression,
by contrast, it suffered less than others.
What this is not, therefore, or at least not yet, is a global depression, by
which is meant a prolonged period of worldwide economic decline, with
falling prices and collapsing trade. Between 1930 and 1932, for example,
world trade in manufactures fell by 40 per cent. This time trade continues
to grow.
At the same time, the current recession is different from others since the
second world war. As a consequence - argues Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the US Federal Reserve - recovery is also likely to be particularly slow.
This slowdown, so far most evident in the Anglo-Saxon economies, has been
both unexpected and consistently underestimated. At the end of 1989, for
example, the OECD forecast fairly steady growth for US and the UK (see
charts).
It is true that most economic slowdowns are unexpected. But the last two -
the oil-shock related recessions of 1973-76 and 1979-83 - were unexpected
for a rather good reason. The combination of a sudden sharp deterioration in
the terms of trade with a desire to lower rates of inflation in the
industrial countries, which reached 14 per cent in 1974 and 11 per cent in
1980, explained both the recession and the surprise. But this time there has
been an unexpected recession without a similar global surprise.
The exception that seems to prove the rule has been Europe, where German
unification has been one explanation for recent mediocre performance. It was
partly an accident of history, but also a mistake by the politicians that
made this the moment when the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System was treated as a modern-day gold standard.
The rest is already history: a short-lived economic spurt in Germany; a
boost to demand in the rest of Europe from the disappearance of the German
external surplus, more than offset by the recessionary effects of the rise
in German interest rates; slower growth in Europe; and, finally, the exit of
the lira and sterling from the ERM and the devaluation of the Spanish
peseta.
German unification is not the only unexpected political event to affect
current economic performance. The peace dividend, also caused by the end of
the cold war, has important effects on the US. California, now expected to
reject Mr Bush in the presidential election, is the most significant victim
of defence cuts.
Yet the story in the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia and Scandinavia,
economies that together account for two-thirds of the total output of the
industrial countries, is rather different. It is one of asset price
inflation followed by debt-deflation. In the 1980s, private citizens - from
the humblest house buyer in Surbiton to Mr Paul Reichmann - chose to bet on
inflation, something that the financial liberalisation of the 1980s made too
easy and over-ambition or perhaps simple greed made too attractive.
According to the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook****, the ratio of total
private non-financial sector debt to GDP rose from below 0.8 to above 1.6 in
the UK, from above 1 to above 1.4 in the US and from 1.3 to 2.2 in Japan
between 1980 and 1991. Prices of residential property, deflated by consumer
prices, rose by some 200 per cent in Japan between 1980 and 1991, by roughly
three-quarters in the UK between 1980 and 1989 and by some 30 per cent in
the US. Thereupon they plunged, with serious consequences both for debtors
and financial intermediaries. The latter is not surprising: in the US 42 per
cent of all outstanding bank loans was against property in 1991, while in
the UK the proportion was 31 per cent.
Provided the financial system does not collapse, depositors should feel
little worse off as a result of asset price falls. But substantial net
borrowers will. In the UK, for example, the ratio of mortgage debt to the
value of the housing stock rose by almost 10 percentage points, to nearly 33
per cent, between 1988 and early 1992. As net worth declines, people try to
save more. As the desire to save rises, economies decline, further
undermining debt-servicing capacity.
In the 1980s, real rates of interest - interest rates deflated by the prices
of goods and services - were high, above the long-term rates of growth in
most industrial countries. But to purchasers of assets, things looked
different. Since asset prices rose far faster than the prices of goods and
services in general, borrowing seemed a painless way of becoming rich. But
the prices of goods and services, on the one hand, and of assets, on the
other, cannot diverge indefinitely. Ultimately, the relative prices of
assets must fall.
If this is the main problem, what is the prognosis and what, if any, are the
solutions?
The Federal Reserve believes that the past two years have taken the US
economy only about half way through the necessary balance sheet adjustment,
following seven reductions in its benchmark rate of interest, the discount
rate, taking it from 7 to 3 per cent. Some financial economists are gloomier
still. By those standards, Japan has hardly begun its adjustment and the UK
has also far to go, particularly in the personal sector.
Low short-term rates of interest are simply a necessary condition for
balance sheet adjustment. But they are not a sufficient condition for a
strong recovery. Recovery demands a return to borrowing, precisely what
debt-encumbered businesses and individuals will refuse.
What could be more attractive to those responsible for debt-laden economies
than another bout of inflation? If debt-to-GDP ratios are double what
debtors desire, why not double nominal GDP? Only too aware of this danger,
Hayek also wrote that 'the harmful effects of even small doses of inflation
can be staved off only by larger doses of inflation'.
One objection to a policy of default through inflation is that an
uncontrollable flight from the currency would be certain. High inflation is
also a recipe for civil strife and economic inefficiency. Moreover, this was
precisely the policy tried in the 1970s, with disastrous consequences for
the borrowing behaviour of the private sector in the 1980s.
The legacy of past inflation also explains why the other obvious remedy for
the pains of debt adjustment, a fiscal boost, is likely to prove
ineffective. A large government sector is a bulwark against an economic
collapse. But further government borrowing is no sure route to recovery.
Knowing as they do the temptation to inflation inevitable in a highly
indebted economy, investors demand high interest rates as the price for
taking on more long-term debt. Unless a fiscal boost can be believably
limited in duration, the resulting increase in long-term interest rates
would tend to nullify the benefits of a more active fiscal policy.
Far better than the scatter gun of inflation would be a conscious decision
by government to substitute its own liabilities for a part of the
outstanding private debt, but rather to shore up an enfeebled financial
system than to protect borrowers from the consequences of their errors. Debt
nationalisation has already occurred in the US in the case of the savings
and loans institutions, as well as in the case of Scandinavian banks. Nobody
can be sure that it will not happen, to some extent, in the UK and Japan as
well.
Not allowing the financial system to collapse is essential if asset price
declines are not to create a depression. Governments must also keep
short-term interest rates low enough to permit balance sheet adjustment.
Equally important, however, is international co-operation, particularly over
trade. An outbreak of protection, following a collapse in the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations, would be almost the worst possible
mistake.
Governments must ensure the health of their financial systems and the
openness of their economies. Recovery will follow in time, if not as soon as
many hope. The worst mistake of all would be to panic. This is not yet a
re-run of the Great Depression. Provided governments keep their heads, it
should not become one either.
