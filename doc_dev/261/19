   The strength of the U.S. economy since the Oct.
19 stock market crash has demolished the belief that history
invariably repeats itself.
   Generations of schoolchildren learned that the stock market
crashed in October 1929 and the nation then slid into a depression
from which it did not fully recover until World War II.
   Last year's crash was even bigger than 1929's. Half a trillion
dollars of stock wealth was wiped out in a single day as the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 508 points, a record
22.6 percent.
   Yet six months later, the unemployment rate is at a nine-year
low and industries such as steel, paper and chemicals are straining
to keep up with booming demand.
   In fact, many economists now believe the crash helped keep the
economic expansion alive by throwing cold water on inflation fears
and bringing about lower interest rates.
   Suddenly the idea of a crashing stock market doesn't seem so
frightening _ especially to the 80 percent of households that don't
own stock.
   Of course, fearful chart watchers point out that even though the
Dow average is rebounding now, it also rebounded after the 1929
crash.
   They note that while President Reagan is optimistic in April
1988, President Herbert Hoover was optimistic in April 1930.
   By extension, the pessimists conclude that history may yet
repeat itself. Poverty, they say, may be just around the corner.
   The attempt to draw parallels falls short, however.
   ``People who argue that history will repeat itself simply don't
understand history,'' said Richard Day, an economist at the
University of Southern California.
   History shows that stock indexes may repeat previous patterns
for a few months but inevitably go off in different directions, Day
said.
   The economy of 1988 is far healthier and more resistant to
shocks than the economy of 1930 was. For example:
   _The rise of service jobs means Americans are more insulated
from the ups and downs of farming and manufacturing, two sectors
that led the way into the Great Depression.
   _Unemployment insurance, Social Security and other programs
protect Americans, and the economy as a whole, from sudden drops in
income.
   _The 1929 crash came against the backdrop of recession.
Industrial production had fallen at an annual rate of 20 percent
since August of that year. Prices and incomes fell, too. This time
production, prices and incomes have all been rising.
   _World trade spiraled downward in the late 1920s and early 1930s
because of slumping economies and protectionism. This time world
trade is expanding and the crash helped dissuade Congress from
enacting a replay of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff act of 1930.
   _Finally, New Deal regulatory reforms instituted in the 1930s,
such as federal deposit insurance, helped keep Wall Street's fear
from infecting the banking system this time. The Federal Reserve,
which bungled its job after the 1929 crash, acted quickly to quell
panic.
   ``Money is not disappearing into mattresses,'' said Brent
Erensel, senior banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. Consumer confidence rebounded to pre-crash levels
within months.
   Economists worried last fall that Wall Street was a canary in a
coal mine, sending an early warning of disaster. Now many believe
the signal was false.
   ``These sudden drops, caused by this kind of ... stampede
behavior _ you just kind of ignore that. It doesn't give you much
information,'' said William Brock, a University of Wisconsin
economist.
   To be sure, the U.S. economy is not glowingly healthy. Last
year, 184 banks failed, the most since the Depression. But the
closings were orderly, not triggered by bank runs. In the 1930s,
panics forced thousands of banks to close annually.
   Depositors assume, correctly, that regulators will not allow
major banks to fail, said Christopher Mahoney, an associate
director at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   There are other problems: the trade deficit, the budget deficit,
the Third World debt bomb. Unemployment and poverty persist in an
underclass of disadvantaged minorities.
   But the problems, while worrisome, don't point to a 1930s-style
depression, most economists say.
   ``Right after the Monday massacre people said, `Oh my God, here
we go again,''' but now no one is quite certain why the crash
occurred or what it means, Wisconsin's Brock said.
   ``As one jokester said, `If we could have another one of these,
maybe we could settle this debate.'''
