   Just keep telling yourself: It's only a chart. 

   The stock market's latest gyrations are reviving talk among some traders that the market has resumed tracking a path similar to that of 1929-30. 

   That's an unsettling prospect. 
After the crash of October 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered about half of its losses by April 1930, only to begin a severe two-year decline that ushered in the Great Depression. 

   Now the stock market has recovered about one-third of its plunge from last year's highs. 
But that rally has peaked -- for the moment, anyway -- in about the same amount of time after the crash of October 1987. 

   Of course, the economy looks much stronger now than it was in 1930. 
Most investors consider that far more relevant than the chart. 
In fact, New York money manager William Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff Associates Inc., says he won't even look at supposed similarities in market cycles. 
"It tends to focus me away from what's really happening," he says -- for instance, such things as auto sales, retail sales, and capital spending. 

   Moreover, even those analysts who play down comparisons of economic fundamentals between the two periods see some differences in the charts themselves. 

   Still, putting the 1929-31 chart next to the 1987-88 chart can be frightening to behold. 
"It has been scaring people and, seeing more and more people focus on it, it started to scare me," says Michael Benson, a stock trader in London at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

   "The similarities are much too vivid to be ignored," says Stanley Berge, a technical analyst at Tucker, Anthony &amp; R.L. Day Inc. in Providence, R.I. 
He believes the market is headed back down to the low 1700s, the level right after the crash, if not lower. (Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 1978.12, down 20.22 points.) 

   A few traders actually rely on the 1929-30 chart in trying to outguess today's market. 
Peter Borish, vice president of Tudor Investment Corp., has plotted the market chart from 1954 to 1987 against the earlier 33-year period from 1897 to 1929. 
"It's helped us navigate a long bull market and this big decline," he says. 

   Tudor has a computer program that takes the 1929-30 trading pattern and plots a projected 1988 market day by day. 
The model shows an industrial average of 1349.9 by the end of 1988, and a reading of 1152.13 by Feb. 3, 1989. 
Tudor also uses more optimistic models. 

   One technical analyst, Justin Mamis of Cowen &amp; Co., notes that the charts don't fit together exactly. 
One difference is the one mentioned above: the latest rally regained only one-third of the decline in the crash, while the 1929-30 rally regained one-half. 
But that doesn't cheer him up any. 
"This is a weaker rally and therefore a weaker market," he says. 

   Among other differences in the charts, the 1929 crash began nine days later in October than the 1987 version. 
And there was Saturday trading back then on the New York Stock Exchange, so some traders try to adjust for that. 

   Also in 1929, the market broke below its immediate post-crash lows in December, whereas the 1987 market remained above that level. 
And the market rallied sharply at the end of 1987 and then sold off in early 1988, while the 1929-30 market rose more smoothly. 

   In April and May 1930, the market had a broad, gradual top without a sharp turn downward. 
This time around, the move was sharper, accelerated last week by the decline in the dollar. 

   Most telling, there are plenty of fundamental differences between the underlying economic conditions of 1930 and 1988. 

   The current economy, which expanded at a fast clip of 4.8% in the fourth quarter, is still growing. 
Corporate earnings stand to grow 15% to 20% this year. 
Unemployment is at a nine-year low. 
And there's no sign of the sort of deflation that saw prices falling and one key short-term interest rate decline to 2% in 1930 from 6% in 1929. 

   The Brady commission on the 1987 market crash also observed that in the 1920s, U.S. employment was more concentrated in such cyclically sensitive areas as farming, mining and manufacturing. 
Meanwhile, less-cyclical government spending has nearly tripled to 32% from 11% of the U.S. economy. 
Both shifts leave the economy less vulnerable to sudden, violent swings. 

   Some money managers such as David Dreman are aware of the market's parallels to 58 years ago but don't incorporate them into their decision making. 
"I think if you look at the charts alone, they're eerie," he says. 
"But charting tells only a very small part of the overall story." 

   Mr. Dreman recalls that in 1974, many investors were afraid of something called the Kondratieff wave, a 50-year cycle purporting to show that panic and depression were just around the corner. 

   Back in April of 1930, some equally errant pundits were comparing the 1929 crash to the bear market of 1906-07, after which the Dow bounced back from a two-year plunge and regained its old highs by the end of 1909. 

   On the other hand, New York money manager Martin Zweig says he considers the 1930 chart one more thing to worry about. 
His other worries include deflation, a falling dollar, slow money supply growth, bank failures, excess speculation in takeovers, and leverage on corporate balance sheets. 
"I'm a worrier," he says. 

   In her market commentary this week, Shearson's Elaine Garzarelli asked: "Is this a repeat of 1929?" 
Her answer carries some weight because she correctly turned bearish before the crash and became bullish earlier this year. 

   She answers: "We have seen some striking similarities between the current period and the 1929 crash in terms of price patterns and interest-rate behavior." 
She noted that long-term interest rates have declined since the 1987 crash just as they did between November 1929 and March 1930. 
"Yet in examining the economic fundamentals, the two post-crash environments seem quite dissimilar. 
At present the economy appears stable and money supply is growing."
