University: "No Way Out Yet Seen for Heisei Recession"] 
  [Text] Frankly, forecasts for the Japanese economy for 
1994 are not bright in the least. Compared to the previous 
year, a 2-percent decrease is still seen in placement of orders 
for machinery and for construction, which are indicators of 
future capital investment, and there is no sign of recovery in 
consumption. After all, the Heisei recession has lingered on for 
almost three years, and there are not yet signs of its end. On 
top of this, prospects for future employment are seriously 
deteriorating. 
  In the past, the Showa depression [1920's] and the Great 
Depression of the United States were triggered by ruptures of 
giant bubbles in the economies of Japan and the United States. 
In both cases, several years were required to emerge from the 
effects of the ruptures. In the Great Depression, for example, 
the U.S. economy reached its worst condition in the fourth year 
following the big crash in stock prices. The slump started in 
1929, with stock prices plunging to one-eighth of their original 
value by 1933. The real gross national product was one-half of 
that of 1929, and the unemployment rate reached 25 percent. 
Capital investment fell from $40.4 billion in 1929 to $5.3 
billion in 1933. The economic growth rate finally became 
positive in 1934, the fifth year following the rupture. 
  The Heisei recession need not follow the same path as the 
U.S. Great Depression did, which would be a great calamity. But 
it bears many resemblances to the U.S. case in such phenomena as 
the following: financial institutions are confronting a large 
number of bad loans; transactions involving assets have greatly 
diminished; capital investment has been very low for a long 
time; and so on. Taking these factors into consideration, to our 
regret, the Japanese economy may yet face its worst period, but 
it is hoped that a light at the end of the tunnel may be found 
in 1995. 
  One bright prospect is that the foreign economic situation, 
led by the United States, is on the way to recovery. The U.S. 
growth rate is expected to rise to 4 percent in 1994. Its 
high-technology industries centering on automobiles and 
computers have regained confidence and its volume of capital 
investment has increased. In Europe, too, light has at last 
begun to shine. The United Kingdom has recovered, and Germany 
has apparently reached a state of recovery, though hovering at a 
low level. No doubt recoveries in foreign economies will 
favorably affect the Japanese economy. 
  Another bright factor is related to the exchange rate. 
Japanese export-oriented industries cannot make both ends meet 
with the exchange rate at a level of 100 yen to the dollar. As 
a result, the quantity of exports has rapidly decreased. Thus, 
the current account balance of payments surplus began to shrink, 
in terms of both the yen and the dollar. The exchange rate 
responded favorably to this, and began to move toward 
depreciation of the yen. The rapid U.S. business recovery may 
possibly serve to slow down moves toward curtailing the trade 
imbalance. In addition, disparities between foreign and 
domestic interest rates are beginning to widen, which is another 
factor helping to create a strong dollar and a weak yen. 
  The yen appreciation shock following the Plaza Accord was 
absorbed comparatively easily by greatly expanded domestic 
demand created immediately after the agreement. But the current 
strength of the yen came in the midst of a sluggish economic 
situation, and rational investments in automobile and 
electronics industries alone cannot mitigate the shock. If the 
yen rate returns to the level of 120 yen per dollar, 
export-oriented industries may yet fare very well. 
  Irrespective of these encouraging factors, the fact that 
1994 
will be a severe year for the Japanese economy must be faced. 
When the fact that employment statistics are lagging indicators 
of economic realities is taken into consideration, it may easily 
be predicted that the unemployment rate will reach 3 percent. 
  Therefore, it is necessary to implement structural economic 
reform based on a long-range view, in addition to taking 
short-term emergency economic measures. In order to prevent the 
current economic condition from deteriorating further, it is 
urgently required to put in force daring pump-priming measures 
to revitalize business conditions. In that case, an 
aggregate-demand policy such as simply reducing income taxes 
will not suffice. The effects of the rupture of the bubble 
economy linger on as burdens on the Japanese economy, and 
policies are needed to eradicate them. Such capital market 
activation measures as expediting depreciation of bad loans, tax 
reforms to solicit active land transaction and utilization, land 
procurement by public funds, and so on are inevitable. 
  After carrying out these short-term measures to the fullest 
extent possible, a bold restructuring with the 21st century in 
mind should be enforced in a daring manner. Tax reform, with 
adjustments in the ratio of direct and indirect taxes as the 
major element, should come first, followed by liberalization of 
controls and regulations. As for deregulation, the Hiraiwa 
report [by the Economic Reform Research Council] calls for 
"abolition of economic controls and regulations in principle" 
and a total review of all regulations within five years. This 
is an epoch-making proposal for Japan, which is bound by 
controls and regulations, and will depend for its success on 
actual implementation. 
  In addition, a sweeping expansion of social capital is 
necessary with the 21st century close at hand. So far, public 
investment has been lamentably insufficient to meet the the 
great needs of an aging society, as well as needs for skills and 
information. The current basic plan for public investment has 
to be reviewed in its entirety so that budget appropriations may 
be adjusted to meet the needs of the times, and at least 1 
trillion yen must be reserved and accumulated additionally for 
this purpose. In order to ensure further development, it is 
inevitable for Japan to actively build up social capital 
required for its future. This must be done within the next 15 
years, in which time Japan will still be able to reserve funds 
before the aging of its society begins in earnest. 
  Economic reform is an inevitable task for Japan, which must 
create an economic society of greater creativity and more 
vitality. I hope that the Heisei recession will be used as an 
opportunity to carry out that structural reform.
