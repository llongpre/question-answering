   Is America really in decline economically?
   The issue is usually posed as a question, because the plain
truth is that nobody really knows, even those who have written
profound tomes on the subject, and by reason of having done so
claim the designation ``expert.''
   The New York Times magazine and Newsweek in cover stories this
year asked ``Is America In Decline?'' U.S. News &amp; World Report
phrased it diffently, asking: ``Are We Losing It?'' All major news
magazines have run similar stories.
   While the question is the most pervasive that can be tackled by
the political candidates, they seldom take more than a jab at it _
usually in reference to trade and budget deficits _ rarely treating
it as a whole.
   Scholarly tomes have not been totally convincing. And popular
texts, such as that written by Ravi Batra about the great
depression supposedly to come in 1990, have been so bludgeoned by
critics that they their credibility quickly wanes.
   Nevertheless, the doubts generated by the questions and the
evasions, and by the very fact that they are being asked, have left
I iidespread feeling that the great minds of American economics are
pessimistic about the future.
   Well, not" ...
  ...   fact, many highly respected economists believe
that the entire gloomy thesis has been overstated and seldom
documented and that popular and academic thinking alike mightb{
caught in a rut.
  *Jfmes Griffen, economist at Ae\n  Life &amp; Casualty, is one.
Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities is another.
   Each has been concerned enough to examine the thesis not just by
the current evidence but through history, too. Each believes that
analysts are misleading themselves by viewing events through dated
perspectives.
   Says Griffen: Though enthusiastically publicized, the story is
now being undercut by events, ``leading to its own decline and
ultim!u demise. Good riddance.''
   And Yardeni: ``The pessimists do play a very important role in
our society by identifying the problems. But they tend to
exaggerate: The forces of darkness always seem to be superior to
the forces of light.''
   The case for American decline is narrowly based, says Griffen,
who offers this insight into the trade deficit, often viewed as
Amexidan weakness:
   ``At its core is a misperception of the implications of
globalization. Much lip service is paid these days to the idea of
one world economy, but many commentators then reason within an
essentially nationalist framework.''
   In his view, critics portray the trade deficit as a case of
shoddy American goods getting bested in economic competition by the
higher quality, higher value products of rising nations. The
deficit becomes an emblem of decline.
   But, he says, ``a cooler and more broadly based version of these
events is that the American deficits of the 1980s provided a
Keynesian fiscal boost to a global econom|`jn danger of pitching
into the abyss.
   ``Far from supporting the case for decline, the twin deficits of
this decade will be seen by future historians as the bold
initiative of U.S. policy which, in the formative years of the
global economy, substantially cuhioned the Great Depression of the
1980s.
   Argues Griffen: ``When others shrank from leadership, the United
States accepted a disproportionate share of the burden.''
   Yardeni's optimistic view of current events and future
possibilities is so detailed that it has evolved into an entire
econ/lc framework called ``New Wave Economics.''
   New Wave economics rejects many of the old business-cycle
frameworks _ such as monetarism and supply-side economics _ as too
rigid and dogmatic, often irrelvant to modern events, ``and
downright useless at other times.''
   An example: Powerful demographic forces related to the aging of
the baby boom, often unexamined by others, should push personal
savings toward 10 percent and the unemployment rate down to 4
percent within the next five years.
   The baby boomers' savings will help finance government and
industry. They will help keep interest rates down. And as they come
into their own, the baby boomers will become more productive,
rather than a drain on the economy.
   In his view, capitalism has never been more dynamic, and
eventually wil,!
