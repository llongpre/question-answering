   Ravi Batra was used to making tumultuous global
economic forecasts and having nobody listen. Then some of the
predictions started to come true.
   Batra is republishing his 1977 book ``The Downfall of Capitalism
and Communism,'' this month, 13 years after the India-born
economist predicted the Iron Curtain and Berlin Wall would come
down.
   ``When I took the book around to American publishers in 1977,
they fought back laughter and said they weren't interested in such
an outrageous forecast,'' Batra said.
   ``Dr. Doom'' still is scorned by most mainstream economists, but
he no longer lacks an audience.
   Batra, a 46-year-old professor of economics at Southern
Methodist University, attracted international attention when his
1987 New York Times best-seller ``The Great Depression of 1990''
predicted a cataclysmic drop in the stock market for that year.
That Oct. 19, the Dow Jones average fell 506 points.
   The crash helped bring Batra's alarming forecasts into focus. He
expounded his theories on television talk shows and was invited to
advise a U.S. Senate committee on economic growth.
   Batra's 1987 prophecy and a follow-up called ``Surviving the
Great Depression of 1990'' paint worldwide unemployment, deflation,
stock market crashes and bank failures beginning this year and
lasting at least seven years.
   ``I predicted then and I am sticking to my guns that capitalism
and communism will both endure a complete collapse around the year
2000,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``Except for an introduction and one additional chapter
outlining what I think will happen in the 1990s, `The Downfall of
Capitalism and Communism' is exactly as I wrote it in 1977,'' he
said.
   Britain's Macmillan Press printed 5,000 copies of the book in
1978. Now Batra's publishing it again via Dallas-based Taylor
Publishing Co.
   ``Every depression starts with a recession,'' Batra said. ``We
are already seeing signs of a recession with the recent collapses
of Campeau and Drexel Burnham.''
   Problems in the market for high-risk junk bonds pushed the U.S.
retailing operations of Campeau Corp. and investment banking
business of Drexel Burnham Lambert into bankruptcy court earlier
this year.
   ``The junk bond market is in shambles and the savings and loan
failures are magnifying. Unemployment is also beginning to rise and
will probably reach 8 percent by the end of 1990,'' Batra said.
   By 1995, he said, the country will be plagued with ``soup and
kitchen lines worse than in the 1930s.''
   Batra wrote in 1977 that communism's bare-bones living standards
combined with the continued repression of basic freedoms ``will
force Marxism to crumble under its own weight ... perhaps in the
next 25 years.''
   He's revised that scenario since communist governments began
unraveling in the East bloc last year, a result of the
liberalizations created by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. But
Batra suggested communism as a system is likely to make a last
stand before succumbing.
   ``Soviet hard-liners and army officers, who have lost out in the
recent realignment of power, could take advantage of growing unrest
and economic stagnation and overthrow Gorbachev in a military
coup,'' the book states.
   ``Even when communism recovers to make a last stand, it will
prove to be a rearguard action, delaying not stopping the
inevitable.''
   Batra said he hired a bodyguard after Black Monday in 1987 to
protect himself from death threats. He has drawn worldwide
criticism for columns published in prominent newspapers heralding
economic nightmares.
   Batra said his forecasts are born from the teachings of Indian
mentor P.R. Sarkar, a spiritualist whose writings outline a history
of social cycles dominating history.
   Sarkar heads an Indian sect called the Path of Bliss, some of
whose followers have been known to take part in rites such as
dancing with human skulls.
