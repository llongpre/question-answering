JOHN Maynard Keynes spent most of his professional life explaining how
Britain could avoid the distress and waste of high unemployment. His
disciples, who dominated economics after the Second World War, believed that
as a result of his work, the great depression of the 1930s need never happen
again. Yet British unemployment reached more than 3.1m in 1986. Now, six
years later, the dole queues are again lengthening and an end of the
recession is not in sight. Was Keynes's lesson neglected or has he proved to
be, in some sense, wrong?
To understand these contemporary questions one needs to go back to the
period before Keynes's work, the General Theory of Employment, Interest and
Money (published in 1936) - to the 1920s. It was abnormal British
unemployment rather than lack of demand in the world economy that he sought
to explain in A Tract on Monetary Reform (1923) and A Treatise on Money
(1930). Above all, he wanted to show that, by overvaluing the pound in 1925,
the Bank of England was forced to set interest rates too high to allow full
employment.
It is from this perspective that we should look at what Keynes has to offer
us. In the 1920s, Britain was in a self-induced depression, with the world
economy moderately prosperous. Similarly today, the issue is not the
collapse of the world economy, but the collapse of the British economy.
Indeed, while Keynes was writing his General Theory to explain how a closed
economy can run down, Britain was recovering from the world depression with
a cheap money policy. So the parallel is with the 1920s, not the 1930s: the
theme, the monetary mismanagement of the British economy.
Keynes's vision of Britain in the 1920s was of an arthritic, or perhaps
merely mature, economy suffering from a deflationary overdose inflicted by a
financial oligarchy, too proud and ignorant to attend to social detail. He
was well aware of the structural weaknesses of the British economy - the
incompetence of business management dominated by 'third generation men', the
obstructionism of the trade unions, 'once the oppressed now the tyrants' -
the general resistance to change. He was infuriated that monetary policy,
instead of trying create a favourable climate for overcoming these
weaknesses, made them lethal. When the government imposed its package of
economies on September 8 1931 in a last effort to keep Britain on the gold
standard, he exploded before a group of Labour MPs: 'I speak from a full
heart. The course of policy pursued so far has reduced us to a point of
humiliation one could not have conceived'.
At the same time, Keynes understood that stable exchange rates were good for
a large trading economy. The dilemma he faced was how to combine a monetary
policy geared to maintaining full employment (that is, relatively easy
credit) with membership of a fixed exchange rate system. Keynes was the
first to realise, or at least say, that exchange rates should reflect the
competitive power of national economies and not be used to force downward
adjustment of money costs. If so used, any system of fixed exchange rates
would break down. By overvaluing sterling in 1925, Britain destroyed the
gold standard system which it had created, just as by overvaluing sterling
within the ERM in 1990, Britain has come close to destroying the mechanism
so painfully constructed in the 1980s.
The reconciliation of the two requirements of domestic and international
stability required, Keynes thought, keeping the whole world in 'quasi-boom'.
This was the neglected lesson of the 19th century. Over that period, he said
in 1930: 'Prices were on the whole tending upwards, and allowing for the
sharp increase in efficiency which was going on all the time. There was
never any occasion to use bank rate to bring about a downward adjustment of
wages.'
The problem which dominated his lifetime was how to set Britain back into
the right starting position for this ascent to prosperity after the
catastrophic 'interruption' of the first world war. In the 1920s, this
seemed to him a problem of restoring the domestic equilibrium of wages and
prices, disrupted by the wartime and postwar inflation. This, he thought,
should be done before stabilising the exchange rate.
The defeat of the postwar inflation had left a legacy of over 10 per cent
unemployment. Prices had fallen faster than money wages, so that employers
had been forced to cut costs by reducing their workforce. Today, although
prices are rising, employers face similar pressures because wages have risen
faster. So in both periods, the purchasing power of wage earners (real
wages) rose. In 1922, Keynes said:
'The continuance of unemployment is to an important extent due to the fact
that we have got the level of wages out of gear with everything else. The
only way in which they will get into gear will be by an increase in the
level of prices'.
He wanted to get prices up to induce employers to take on more workers, and
the exchange rate down to ensure that the price of British goods did not
rise too much.
The Treasury and the Bank of England, however, took a similar view to that
enunciated by Norman Lamont, the present Chancellor, when he said on July 10
of this year: 'The way to success is to adjust your costs to your exchange
rate, not the other way round'. The monetary policy pursued by the
authorities throughout the early 1920s was dominated by their desire to put
sterling back on to the Gold standard at its prewar parity with the dollar
(Dollars 4.86). Employers would be expected to cut wages and prices
sufficiently to make export industries competitive at that rate.
The Treasury / Bank view of the 1920s was echoed in the Medium Term
Financial Strategy adopted by the Thatcher government in 1980 and in the
overvaluation of sterling in 1990. The assumption linking the two eras was
that if monetary policy is credible, business behaviour will adjust to the
monetary framework set by the authorities. In his evidence to the Macmillan
Committee Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, said: 'I have
never been able to see myself why for the last few years it should have been
impossible for industry starting from within to have readjusted its
position'.
Keynes knew this was myopic. In March 1925, Winston Churchill, the
Chancellor, gave a dinner party, to which he invited Keynes and Reginald
McKenna, the two foremost opponents of the return to gold. They were to
battle it out with two Treasury officials, Lord Bradbury and Otto Niemeyer.
Keynes and McKenna stuck to the point that British prices had not fallen
enough to support the prewar value of sterling. Going back to gold at
Dollars 4.86 would overvalue the pound by 10 per cent, requiring a 10 per
cent fall in money wages. Bradbury and Niemeyer retorted that only returning
to gold at the old parity would stop Britain living in a fools' paradise of
inflated real wages. The gold standard, they said, was 'knave (ie
politician) proof'. In the end McKenna, a former Chancellor, gave way.
'There is no escape; you have to go back; but it will be hell', he said.
Keynes stood firm.
Keynes saw that the only way a policy of high interest rates can cause
prices to fall is by withdrawing from employers the financial means to
employ labour at the existing level of money wages. It means 'intensifying
unemployment without limit, until the workers are ready to accept the
necessary reduction of money wages under the pressure of hard facts'. He
suspected that the government would shrink from the logic of its policy.
Bank rate would be kept high enough to attract foreign funds to London and
retard domestic investment, but not high enough to break workers' resistance
to money wage reductions. The result would be to 'jam' the British economy
in a low employment trap.
'The fundamental blunder of the Treasury and the Bank of England' he wrote
in 1928 'has been due, from the beginning, to their belief that if they
looked after the deflation of prices the deflation of costs would look after
itself . . .
Unemployment will not decline unless businessmen have the incentive of
plentiful credit, high hopes and . . . a slight inflation of prices but not
of costs'. It was in this context that Keynes developed his plan for
loan-financed public works.
The forced devaluation of sterling on September 21, 1931 unlocked the
British economy. Interest rates came down, facilitating a housing boom;
employment recovered from the depressed levels of the world slump. But this
era of floating exchange rates was accompanied by protectionism, barter
agreements and restrictive trading blocks.
The end of the second world war provided the opportunity for the fresh start
which had eluded the world after 1918. Keynes evolved an 'ideal' plan for a
currency union to reconcile the advantages of the old gold standard with
sufficient national monetary autonomy to maintain full employment. There
would be fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates; creditor countries would not
be allowed to 'hoard' their surpluses; they would be automatically available
as cheap overdraft facilities for other countries at an international
clearing bank. The Bretton Woods agreement of July, 1944 fell short of
Keynes' hopes, being based on the different idea of an international
monetary fund.
Nevertheless, Keynes was convinced that internationalism was back in
business. In May 1944, he denounced the 'technique of little Englandism' as
inconsistent with Britain's tradition. 'With our own resources so greatly
impaired and encumbered, it is only if sterling is firmly placed in an
international setting that the necessary confidence in it can be sustained'.
Some morals of this tale are easier to draw than others. Keynes was right to
argue that international currency regimes, however desirable, will break
down if they become instruments of deflation. British experience under the
ERM and the gold standard support this.
If we want a liberal market order to survive, it must be consciously
stabilised. During the 1980s, when Western governments were recovering their
monetary virtue, the banking system went haywire, spurred on by the demand
for loans on the back of inflated asset prices. Keynes' belief that the
stability of the international economy depends on 'measures to control
capital movements' deserves close scrutiny.
The lessons for Britain are less clear. The problem of getting wages into
closer equilibrium with prices, after decades of inflationary expectations,
is more difficult than it was in 1922 or 1931. But this must happen if there
is to be a durable recovery in employment. The 1990-92 experience showed
that it is a hopeless business to get wage inflation to fall faster than
price inflation. But it is also difficult in a recovery to make sure that
wages rise more slowly than prices, which must happen if employment is to
grow. A policy on pay is inescapable.
Finally, it is more difficult to see what kind of international framework
offers Britain its best hope. If the world economy continues to falter, the
pressure towards economic blocs will strengthen: we can see them in embryo:
the EC, NAFTA, East Asia. If this happens, Britain would be faced with a
dreadful choice, since it can no longer organise an economic bloc of its
own. Its best hope would lie in co-ordinated efforts to expand the world
economy coupled with trade liberalisation.
It is the spirit, rather than the letter, of Keynes which applies today.
Keynes understood that market systems work best when underpinned by broad
agreement on aims and behaviour. This has been true of the successful 20th
century economies - the US, Germany, Japan. Underlying the monetary
mismanagement of the British economy has been a failure to agree on values
and institutions. So Britain oscillates between inflation and unemployment,
undervaluation and overvaluation. Today's challenge is to give Keynes'
vision of a middle way a new form for a new age.
