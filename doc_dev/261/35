   An ebullient early rally gave way to profit-taking as
stock investors assessed the ground war in the Middle East.
   In the first trading since the land war began Saturday,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.49 points to
2887.87 in active volume. But broader market indexes ended
higher. Bond prices rose modestly and the dollar posted solid
gains against the mark and yen.

   The stock market closed before Baghdad Radio announced
late yesterday that Saddam Hussein had ordered Iraqi forces
to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Before that news, the U.S. stock market followed the lead
of Japanese and European markets and rallied sharply at the
opening, fueled by the rapid advance of allied forces and the
surprisingly light casualties they sustained. At its peak,
the Dow industrials were up more than 37 points.
   But profit-taking by wary investors quickly erased these
gains. Traders said many money managers are worried that the
good news from the battlefront can't continue unabated. And
they argue that the stock market is especially vulnerable to
disappointments given the substantial gains of the past
month.
   Yet what little bad news there was didn't hurt prices.
News at midafternoon that an Iraqi Scud missile had destroyed
a building housing U.S. troops left prices virtually
unchanged.
   Even if the allies achieve victory soon, some analysts
warned, the stock rally could succumb to economic problems on
the home front. Gary Shilling, an economist and money
manager, said the 400-point advance since mid-January, based
on widespread assumptions that the economy will soon perk up,
may collapse if the recession is as serious and long-lasting
as he believes it will be.
   Mr. Shilling, a longtime pessimist, suggests that the
current situation may come to resemble the "little bull
market" that occurred in 1930 as stocks recovered from Black
Monday. Both the economy and the stock market soon plunged
into the Great Depression. While he doesn't expect a
depression, Mr. Shilling said the economy may still need to
shake out the excesses of the 1980s much as the Great
Depression wrung out the excesses of the 1920s.
   "We've had all the greed and glitz and now we may wind up
with the grief," he said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices were mixed. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange totaled 193.8 million shares. Advancing issues on
the Big Board were ahead of decliners 939 to 649.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds
gained about an eighth of a point, or about $1.25 for each
$1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue fell to 8.04%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar strengthened. In late New York trading the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.5201 marks and 133.58 yen, compared
with 1.5055 marks and 132.15 yen Friday.
