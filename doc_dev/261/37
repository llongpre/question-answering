   Borrowing rhetoric from Franklin Roosevelt,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said a new worldwide
Great Depression is looming and called for a ``New Deal'' for Third
World debtor nations.
   ``Right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep
economic depression,'' Shevardnadze said in a speech Monday to the
Foreign Policy Association.
   ``The debt of the Third World countries, the interest they have
to pay and the pace of their economic development _ are these not
the signs of an impending catastrophe?'' he asked.
   Developing nations have a $1.3 trillion foreign debt, mostly to
banks in the industrialized Western nations.
   Many Third World nations are unable to pay even the interest on
their debt, and their economies are stagnating as their scarce
funds are used to repay debt rather than build their economies.
   ``Radical new steps are needed, a kind of New Deal,'' said
Shevardnadze, speaking in Russian with the help of a translator.
   He said the United States and his country should share advanced
technology with the developing world, and said ``some debt'' should
be forgiven, a concept already being advanced by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.
   The Soviet Union holds almost none of the developing world's
debt.
   Shevardnadze compared the Soviet Union's current social upheaval
and economic travail with the Great Depression in America, when
radical sentiment grew and many Soviet Communists predicted the
imminent downfall of capitalism.
   ``In 1929, a powerful and confident state took an economic
nosedive. There were bread lines in New York's Times Square and
tents of the jobless huddled along Riverside Drive.
   ``In Washington, troops were fighting the Bonus Army that had
invaded the capital. People were dying in demonstrations, strikes
and riots,'' said Shevardnadze, adding that the same is happening
in his country today.
   The Soviet Union's ``economic system is undergoing an
adjustment,'' he said. ``Something similar happened in the United
States 60 years ago.''
   But he added, ``so long as there is the will, the understanding
of the situation and the determination to change things for the
better _ and we certainly have them _ the economy can remedy its
ills.''
   Shevardnadze predicted that nations would one day compete ``not
for political supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to
water, fresh air and even a green lawn. Such conflicts could be
caused by demographic problems, hunger and poverty among part of
the world's population, or by epidemics of infectious disease.''
   During a question-and-answer session, Shevardnadze declined to
say whether the Soviet Union is likely to renew diplomatic ties
with Israel any time soon.
   He also ducked a question on Soviet policy toward the flow of
refugees from East Germany to West Germany, saying ``those two
countries will be able to sort out that problem.''
