   If the economic news scares you, accompanied as
it usually is with ominous commentary from the ``experts,'' you
might consider the undistinquished record of worry over recent
months.
   You can pick your time period, but this one begins last October,
when those who claim to know told you the stock market crash would
scare business and consumers into retrenchment.
   Neither retrenched, they barely flinched. Business actually
added more to its spending plans for better production facilities.
Consumer spending slowed, but not by much. Whatever, it was
destined to slow anyway.
   Meanwhile, the stock market has recovered about $400 million of
the trillion dollars lost in the crash.
   The anticipated recession didn't come. Those who claim to know
still say it is coming. Someday they'll be correct, of course,
because recessions eventually come. But the ``imminent''
descriptive is out. Wait 'til next year.
   The market crash, the recession to come and inflation and the
big budget and trade deficits and all those other bad things would
cause the dollar to free-fall and cause foreign investors to flee,
the experts warned. It didn't happen.
   Neither did the budget deficit continue to grow to the heavens.
It slowed, and now it appears the deficit next year might decline
to 2.9 percent of gross national product, down from 3.3 percent
this year.
   The trade balance didn't continue to worsen; it improved. The
savings rate didn't continue to decline; it has risen since last
fall. The consumer debt position hasn't continued to rise in a
straight line; the rate of growth has turned down.
   You may recall that the level of factory utilization was rising
into very dangerous territory, according to some warnings, because
with little idle capacity available there would be production
snafus and higher prices. ``Dangerous territory'' became a summer
meadow.
   Rising employment would mean fewer workers available to operate
the nation's factories. That, said the people who know, would mean
upward pressure on wages. But recent wage agreements have been
below the inflation rate.
   Lots of the old problems are still there, and most likely they
will remain a threat for a long time to come. And there is a big
new one _ the drought, which is likely to force up prices of some
commodities.
   But now the popular economic analysis is one that shows
differences instead of similarities between the crash of 1987 and
the stock market debacle of 1929 that ushered in the Great
Depression of the 1930s.
   A typical one: Commodity prices plunged after the 1929 crash but
rose after the 1987 crash. Industrial production fell steeply in
1929 but rose in 1987. Employment fell in 1929 but rose in 1987.
Business spending fell in 1929 but rose in 1987. Federal Reserve
policy tightened in 1929 but became looser in 1987.
   The people who claim to know are quieter now. They are less
inclined to extrapolate into infinity the latest negative change in
prices or interest rates. Besides, they have fewer listeners.
   Given time, there will be new things to worry about because that
is the way it has always been. Oddly, a period of good economic
news is a fertile field for the growing of fears.
   But now we know that some of the fears are fiction, and that _
given the great volume of them that are presented to us by the
folks who claim to know _ relatively few of them come to pass.
