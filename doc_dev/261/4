   Yesterday's computerized panic in the stock market is of course foreboding. 
The stock market has ordinarily been the best single indicator of future economic activity, and the record-shattering losses would seem to predict an unpleasant future indeed. 

   Markets, however, do not ordain events. 
Events are made by men; markets only predict what men are likely to do. 
Their predictive power lies in their ability to collect in one place a mass of individual judgments from around the world; these judgments are of course based on current information. 
If men change, if the trend of likely future policies changes, current markets can be wrong. 
The future is not in the hands of markets, but in our own. 

   With the 22% drop in the Dow Jones Average eclipsing the 12% drop on Black Tuesday in 1929, some parallels with the 1930s are in order. 
From the high of 381 in September 1929, the Dow Jones Industrials fell to the low of 41 in July 1932; this drop measured the Great Depression. 
The October 28-29 Great Crash took the averages from 298 to 230. 
But as late as April 1930, stocks had recovered to 294. 
The October Crash was a warning shot, as the first clouds gathered that might coalesce into the coming storm. 

   In restrospect it seems clear, at least to us, that the Great Depression was essentially a massive protectionist mistake, feeding into an international economic scene with international debt problems and exchange-rate instability quite similar to those of today. 
On June 14, 1930, the industrial average closed at 244, compared with 210 two years earlier. 
On June 15, President Hoover said he would not veto the Smoot-Hawley tariff; the Depression was on in earnest. 

   If in 1929 the market was telling us to dispel the gathering clouds of protectionism, what is it telling us today? 
There is of course plenty of protectionism in the air, and congressional pressures for a tax increase; these are certainly part of a worrisome horizon. 
But we think yesterday's warning shot is about exchange-rate instability, a possible collapse of the value of the dollar, the vehicle that carries world trade and investment. 

   As President Reagan and President Nakasone met in April, we wrote of "A Crisis Summit." 
The world desperately needed a U.S.-Japanese bargain to stabilize exchange rates through monetary policies instead of foreign exchange market interventions sterilized by domestic transactions. 
We despaired of such vigorous action, but the two presidents stepped out of their meeting and declared an end to sterilization. 

   The markets took off on another bullish leg, which stalled as new doubts arose about the dollar, and turned into panic with the Germans raising interest rates and many influential Americans talking of letting the dollar fall. 
We need to think now about defending the dollar, perhaps by calling on U.S. gold stocks if necessary. 
Treasury Secretary Baker issued a joint statement with German Finance Minister Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Poehl, pledging to defend the dollar "around" current levels, and to reinvigorate the Louvre accords, as French Finance Minister Balladur suggested earlier in the day. 
This is surely helpful but perhaps not enough. 
Better that the international financial leaders start thinking of trying to forge out of this crisis a more permanent exchange-rate regime.
