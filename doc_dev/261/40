   Would you really like to see zero inflation?
   A lot of people would, including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, and at least one president of a Federal
Reserve Bank, W. Lee Hoskins of Cleveland.
   These are knowledgeable people, with as much power as anyone to
see that their views are accomplished. Already, they are in pursuit
of those goals.
   Also of that mind are some academic theoreticians, lots of
business people, and some folks in the financial community, where
inflation or its threat is considered an enemy to securities.
   Many ordinary folks might like it too. Retirees enjoy knowing
their pension won't be eroded. Savers want assurance that their
money won't diminish in buying power. Workers want raises to mean
something.
   Many people would like to see inflation disappear simply because
they have come to think of it as evil, sinful, deceitful,
destructive _ a killjoy that ruins the party. Repeatedly, it is so
described in the media.
   In all, inflation is about the most popular enemy in economics,
with very few people having anything good to say about it. To
support it or defend it is likely to ruin anyone's reputation for
common sense.
   Yet, in the past 60 years inflation generally has been
accompanied by economic growth, while its absence has almost always
been associated with recession or depression.
   True, some of that growth is an illusion, with rising prices
shaving from buying power almost as much or more than is added to
paychecks. That's one of the raps against inflation _ it is
deceptive.
   It is also well known and documented that high or rising
inflation is often a prelude to recession, even a cause, and most
certainly a reflection of unsustainable growth rates.
   Using as measuring sticks the 1982 dollar and the so-called
gross national product deflator, the most broad-based inflation
index, only in 1936 did inflation average exactly zero for the year.
   While that was in the midst of the Great Depression, it was one
of the better years within it. GNP grew sharply, only to fall again
in 1938. In most years of the Great Depression, however, there was
no inflation whatever.
   In fact, you might say deflation ran wild. The worst of it was
in 1932, when ``inflation'' reached minus 11.5 percent, but it was
also evident in every year from 1930 through 1934, and again in
1938 and 1939.
   In 1949, the inflation-deflation rate dipped below zero again,
to 0.4 percent, and while the economy didn't shrink it also failed
to grow. Since then there has always been at least 1 percent
inflation, the least being in 1961.
   This record, it can be argued, might add up to nothing. Still,
it is hard to dispute the empirical evidence that the pursuit of
zero inflation may be dangerous.
   Theory bolsters the contention. For example, proponents and
opponents of the zero-inflation goal agree that to bring down any
existing level of inflation means slowing economic expansion.
   Any slowdown, of course, is reflected in and demonstrated by
statistical evidence of curtailed production, sales, profits, wages
and layoffs, and perhaps in lower corporate stock prices and
dividends too.
   An intentionally induced slowdown, implemented by restraining
money supply and keeping interest rates high, is a fragile
undertaking. At best, it is probably mere guesswork as to when to
apply or relieve pressure.
   During this time the Fed must rely on statistical measurements,
and some of those measurements provide evidence after the fact;
when they reveal their news it is already too late. To seek zero,
therefore, is to risk recession.
   There is also error to contend with.
   Each year, economist Walter J. Williams surveys his colleagues
at a meeting of the National Association of Business Economists.
Last year he found 72 percent of them were unhappy with the quality
of government data.
   It is worth noting, he said, ``and perhaps a little
frightening,'' that the greatest skepticism was directed at numbers
generally given the most weight by financial decision-makers.
   Among them are reports on the gross national product, whose
expansion or shrinkage determines whether we are in recession.
