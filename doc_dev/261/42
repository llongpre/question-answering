   Here is a glossary of some frequently used terms
related to the stock market:
   BARGAIN HUNTERS: Investors looking to buy shares at reduced
prices in a period of market decline.
   BLACK MONDAY: Refers to the Oct. 19, 1987, plunge that saw the
Dow Jones industrial average fall a record 22.6 percent. The term
previously referred to the Oct. 28, 1929, selloff, also known as
the Great Crash, when the Dow industrials fell 12.8 percent and
helped trigger the Great Depression.
   CIRCUIT BREAKERS: A post-crash system of rules to temporarily
halt trading of stocks and futures contracts when prices plummet.
   COMPUTERIZED PROGRAM TRADING: A computer-run strategy enabling
big institutional investors to make lightning-quick trades of huge
amounts of stocks, stock index futures and options on index futures
in attempts to profit from price disparities among these markets.
   DIVIDEND: A payment made to shareholders of a corporation from
earnings, payable at a fixed rate on preferred shares and at a
varying rate, according to the size of profits, on common shares.
   DOW JONES AVERAGE: Refers to the Dow Jones &amp; Co. average of
stock prices of 30 major industrial companies, a closely watched
barometer of blue-chip issues.
   EXPRESS SERVICE: A New York Stock Exchange service that puts
individual orders of up to 2,099 shares ahead of big, institutional
orders, generally on days when there is a 25-point change in the
Dow industrials.
   GREAT CRASH: The stock market collapse that occurred on ``Black
Monday,'' Oct. 28, 1929, when the Dow Jones average dropped 12.8
percent. The historic event helped trigger the Depression of the
1930s.
   INDEX ARBITRAGE: The purchase of a stock-index future in one
market and sale of the stocks that comprise that index in another
market, or vice versa, in order to profit from temporary price
differences in the two markets. Index arbitrage is the most widely
used form of computerized program trading.
   MARGIN ACCOUNT: A credit line enabling an investor to speculate
in the market with shares bought with borrowed money that is backed
by collateral such as the investor's stock holdings. Under Federal
Reserve regulations, investors may borrow up to 50 percent of the
value of a stock purchase. When the value of an investor's
collateral falls below the amount of money the investor has
borrowed to buy stock, a brokerage firm will make a ``margin call''
requiring the investor to put up more collateral or face the forced
sale of the stock.
   MUTUAL FUND: An organization that invests the money of its
shareholders in a diversified group of securities of various
corporations.
   OPTION: An agreement, usually for a fee, that permits an
investor to buy or sell a stock or a stock index future within a
specified time period in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
   PORTFOLIO INSURANCE: A strategy in which investors sell options
or futures against the underlying stock in a portfolio to offset
price declines and enhance price increases. The strategy widely
fell out of favor after the 1987 market crash.
   SHORT SELLING: The practice of selling borrowed securities,
expecting to be able to buy them later at a lower price before
having to return them to the lender.
   STOCK: The permanently invested capital of a corporation
contributed by the owners when the corporation is organized and
then divided into shares, each representing a proportionate
ownership in the company. Common stock enjoys an exclusive claim to
net assets and profits of a corporation if no other class of stock
is issued. Preferred stock, when issued, takes precedence over
common stock according to specified terms.
   STOCK INDEX FUTURES: Contracts that allow investors to buy and
sell theoretical packages of stocks for delivery at a future date.
   TRADING HALT: A measure designed to check a steep slide in the
stock market.
   VOLATILITY: Wild price swings in stock trading.
   YIELD: The difference between the purchase price and the face
value of a security.
