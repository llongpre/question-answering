   Panic stock selling isn't likely to jolt the
economy much beyond Wall Street, but if the losses deepen the
effect could become more profound, economists and investors say.
   ``I'll sleep just as good tonight as I did last night,'' said G.
B. Mann, a 78-year-old retiree from Dallas with a portfolio of more
than $1 million, after a panic selloff Friday that sent the Dow
Jones Industrial average to its second steepest single-day point
loss ever, down 190.58 to 2,569.26.
   He estimated Friday's market break cost him $10,000.
   The one-day loss would likely have little immediate effect on
most households. But if the selling spilled into future sessions,
some economists worried that consumer spending could plunge and the
health of small businesses could be affected.
   For the most part, investors, especially long-time ones with
experience with the market's ups and downs, seemed unperturbed.
   ``It really will not have a major effect on my lifestyle,'' said
Ernest Harden, who has a computer software and consulting business
in Jacksonville, Fla. and puts his market holdings at $400,000.
   ``At this point I'm not deeply concerned. Since I'm a long-term
investor, I'm not going to get excited. I'll ride it through,'' he
said.
   Thomas O'Hara, executive director of the National Association of
Investors Corp., the country's largest group representing small
investors, said he saw little panic among traders in the aftermath
of Friday's losses.
   ``An awful lot of our investors have been here before,'' O'Hara
said in an interview in Minneapolis where his group was holding a
convention.
   ``Among the new investors, you'll find some people who are
definitely disappointed, but most of our members weren't planning
on selling their stocks tomorrow,'' he said.
   ``If it stops here, the impact will be small,'' said Robert
Eisner, an economics professor at Northwestern University. ``As far
as the behavior of households, the impact would be trivial. Even
the huge crash of October '87 had a discernible impact but not an
enormous effect on household behavior and consumption.''
   But he and others worried that if the market slump continued,
small businesses trying to raise capital might find that harder,
and sustained stock market losses could eventually take a bite out
of housing, car and durable goods sales.
   ``Things can mushroom,'' Eisner said. ``I would hope things can
be stopped quickly.''
   Since Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow average dropped a record 508
points, small investor portfolios have risen 26.8 percent,
according to Money Magazine's Small Investor Index, an average
annual return of 12.7 percent.
   ``To me the sad part is that more people will be scared away. It
has a bad effect on the people who just joined the market or were
thinking of joining it, and we need those people,'' said O'Hara.
   Avner Arbel, a Cornell University stock market expert, said in
an interview this week that his biggest worry is the impact of
market losses on small companies, which make up about one-third of
the business market.
   He said their stocks are priced relatively high, their earnings
are extremely volatile, and their growth in sales and profits is
generally poor.
   ``Small companies really represent the financial future of this
country,'' Arbel said. ``Traditionally, that's the sector of the
economy where growth and innovation come from. Weakness in the
sector is equivalent to weakness in our youth. It's highly
significant for the future.''
   In an even more pessimistic assessment, Ravi Batra, professor of
international economics at Southern Methodist University and author
of ``The Great Depression of 1990,'' said the market plunge could
augur ``the coming Great Depression.''
   ``There's an extremely high concentration of debt. There are too
many poor people and too many rich people. The ocean of debt is
very vast.''
