TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL R. KRUGMAN: CAN WE AVERT THE NEXT FINANCIAL 
CRISIS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PAUL R. KRUGMAN, PAUL R. KRUGMAN is professor of economics at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Consider the following picture: It is a time of peace and prosperity, of 
capitalism triumphant. The Republican Party has overwhelmingly won the past 
three presidential elections, apparently establishing a permanent lock on the 
White House -- and why not, because Republican policies have brought steadily 
rising employment and consumption. Businessmen are the heroes of the age; 
organized labor is in retreat. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, a few blots on the picture. Battered by low export prices 
and the burden of their foreign debt, less developed countries do not share in 
the prosperity of the industrial world. Protectionist pressures are rising. 
There are strains on the international system because the traditional leader of 
the world economy is in relative decline, while the most economically dynamic 
major nation remains unwilling to take on its full responsibilities. 
Nonetheless, the fundamental picture is so strong that few would suppose that 
disturbances in the financial markets could produce more than a brief, mild 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
The year, of course, is 1929. Herbert Hoover is President. Britain is the 
declining leader of the international system, and the United States the dynamic 
nation unwilling to step into Britain's shoes. And the greatest economic 
catastrophe of modern history is about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
As the market hiccupped this year on Friday the 13th, the question that 
everyone asked two years ago came around once more: Can it happen again? 
</P>
<P>
A group of economists and policy-makers met recently in Cambridge, Mass., to 
discuss just that issue. Although the discussion was full of disagreements, and 
off the record anyway, I concluded several things from it. 
</P>
<P>
First, in a purely financial sense, crises on the scale of 1929 are if anything 
even more likely than they were 60 years ago. Black Monday in 1987 was actually 
worse than Black Thursday in 1929, and the global spread of the stock crash in 
1987 was faster and more complete than that of 1929. Computers and faster 
communications apparently don't make markets any more rational; they just allow 
panic to spread more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the modest reforms undertaken since 1987 have done little if 
anything to reduce the vulnerability of the market to crashes. As it turned 
out, Friday the 13th didn't develop into a full replay of Black Monday -- but 
it certainly could have. 
</P>
<P>
On the more optimistic side, financial crises do not have to turn into real 
depressions. In October, 1987, a few sensible things were done, and the effect 
was to insulate the real economy almost completely from the effects of 
financial panic. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to pour credit into the economy 
after the crash, abandoning for the time being both its monetary targets and 
any attempt to stabilize the dollar. Money growth accelerated to levels that 
horrified monetarists, and the dollar plunged 17% against the Japanese yen; but 
the crisis was contained. For most of the population, the stock market crash 
was purely a spectator event. 
</P>
<P>
What I learned from the historical discussion, however, was that the contrast 
between disaster in 1929 and successful containment of crisis in 1987 was not 
because of any fundamental change in the vulnerability of the economy. Had the 
Federal Reserve acted in 1929 as it did in 1987, there would almost surely have 
been no Great Depression. On the other hand, had the Federal Reserve acted in 
1987 the way it did in 1929, we would not now be shrugging the whole thing off 
as a temporary market aberration. The difference between then and now was 
primarily one of leadership, not institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders deserve praise, of course, but it is worrisome when so much hangs 
on having a few men do exactly the right things. As one conference participant 
put it, we have relied on brilliant chairmen of the Federal Reserve to deal 
with financial crises twice in one decade; will our chairmen always be so 
brilliant? 
</P>
<P>
What is particularly worrisome is that many economic pundits advocate policies 
that would have ruled out the actions that insulated the real economy from 
financial panic in 1987. Suppose, in particular, that the kind of economists 
favored by the Wall Street Journal -- people such as Stanford's Ronald McKinnon 
or Columbia's Robert Mundell -- had been at the helm in the weeks after Black 
Monday. What would these people, whom we may refer to as "global monetarists," 
have done? The answer is, nothing -- or worse than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
As advocates of a real or simulated gold standard, they would have fiercely 
opposed the policy of rapid credit expansion that sterilized the real impact of 
the crash while driving down the dollar; this is especially true because the 
global monetarists insist on regarding the dollar as seriously undervalued. 
Since the crash would have placed downward pressure on the dollar even without 
a rapid credit expansion, and since this downward pressure would have been 
reinforced by speculation about possible future dollar depreciation, a global 
monetarist approach would actually have required a considerable credit 
contraction. 
</P>
<P>
The result would have been to turn the market slump into a major real slump as 
well. Probably our economy is not as depression-prone as the economy of 1929, 
but the result would still have been disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this scenario is not to emphasize how bad the economic analysis 
is at the Wall Street Journal or how bad the advice given by some economists is 
(although both points are true enough). Instead, the point is that we were all 
very lucky: The sensible and timely policies that actually averted disaster 
were carried out in the teeth of advice from seemingly reasonable and 
respectable voices. 
</P>
<P>
Someone once pointed out that the reason that the Romans, not the Greeks, ended 
up ruling the world was that while Hellenistic armies could perform miracles 
under brilliant leadership, Roman armies could manage adequately with mediocre 
generals -- which is more important in the long run. Unfortunately, we seem to 
have a Greek, not a Roman, world financial system. So the answer is yes -- it 
can happen again, though not under current management. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that was not the observation that most depressed me about the conference on 
crises. For the time being, at least, we seem to know what to do about stock 
market crashes and to have a leadership that is prepared to act on what we 
know. There is, however, another kind of international financial crisis: the 
kind of crisis that happens when a heavily indebted country's creditors decide 
that it is no longer a good risk. This is the kind of crisis that hit Latin 
America in 1982 and that may someday hit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, we do not seem to know how to manage debt crises. The same 
people who averted financial crises in 1982 and 1987 have attempted to deal 
with the Latin American problem for the past seven years. They have organized 
emergency loans, collective bargaining between debtors and creditors, 
international coordination on a grand scale. And the result? A decade of 
declining living standards, soaring unemployment and hyper-inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America has done worse in the '80s than it did in the '30s. Predictions 
of a hard landing for the United States have so far not come true, but then 
people who worried about Third World debt were widely regarded as cranks right 
up to the moment of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
So there won't be a replay of 1929 in the near future; but if you want to see 
America turn into Argentina, it's a possibility.
