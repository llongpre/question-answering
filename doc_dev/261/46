   This may be a sleep time for great
agricultural crusades in Washington, at least until after the
November elections.
   A widely reported financial recovery in the farm sector, new
credit legislation, rising agricultural exports, and the
approaching busy time of another spring have dulled the swords of
challenge.
   One of the last hints of battle on behalf of producers was put
aside 10 days ago by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who announced he
had no further plans to seek changes in the current soybean program.
   There was simply ``a lack of consensus'' on how to proceed on a
proposed marketing loan program for soybeans, Glickman said. The
American Soybean Association, in fact, had asked that no changes be
made.
   But an attempt was made last week to include a ``triggered''
marketing loan program in the thousand-page trade bill being
negotiated by House and Senate conferees. Marketing loans, already
in effect for some commodities, provide crop support at U.S. price
levels, allowing farmers to repay the loans at world prices, with
taxpayers making up the difference.
   The marketing loan approach would be triggered for wheat, corn
and soybeans if trade negotiations fail to reduce world
agricultural subsidies by 1990. Administration officials have
indicated President Reagan might veto the trade bill if such a
measure is included.
   Congress in December passed landmark legislation on farm credit,
providing some financial relief to thousands of sorely pressed
families. And a $76 billion budget-cutting package included
reductions and other adjustments in farm program loan rates and
target prices through the 1990 crops.
   Thus, except for the possibility of changes in the sugar program
or sudden tinkering with dairy, the remainder of 1988 may be a
legislative yawner for farm folk.
   But in 1989 _ with a new administration and Congress _ the
debate will begin again, this time on 1990 legislation to amend,
replace or extend the current Food Security Act of 1985.
   The Reagan administration's philosophy for more than seven years
has been in support of ``market-oriented'' agricultural policy,
which the 1985 law, within specific limits, has allowed. The
reduction in crop price support rates, a lowering of milk supports,
and other adjustments are examples of the flexibility permitted in
the current law.
   Critics have proposed more of a ``supply management'' texture to
U.S. farm policy, some advocating the direct role of farmers in
determining how far to go.
   The 1990 farm bill debate will pit old adversaries, or at least
their ideas, some of which have long outlived their progenitors.
   Don Paarlberg, professor emeritus at Purdue University, was a
young farmer with his father and brother at the beginning of the
Great Depression, when farm commodity prices dropped 56 percent
from 1929 to 1932, and land values plummeted by more than half.
   Paarlberg much later held posts in the administrations of three
Republican presidents: Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford. He has been
recognized for decades as one of the nation's foremost agricultural
economists and farm policy experts.
   Last fall Paarlberg wrote an article for IMPRIMIS, the monthly
journal of Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Mich., in which he
recounted those early Depression years on the northwestern Indiana
farm. He described the differing schools of economic thought that
prevailed at the time.
   One school was led by George F. Warren of Cornell University,
who thought the farm problem was general, resulting from the
collapse of money and credit. Warren thought the remedy lay in
revised monetary policy. Paarlberg agreed.
   The other school, led by John D. Black of Harvard University,
held that agriculture itself was to blame because of surplus
production. The remedy consisted of reducing supplies so that
prices would improve.
   As it happened, the New Deal farm program was built upon the
latter philosophy and was a ``major change in the farm policy
agenda,'' Paarlberg said. For 70 years prior to the onset of New
Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration in 1933, there had
been a ``historic agenda based on increased production, individual
farmer decision and competitive markets,'' he said.
   Paarlberg said the key words for the new farm policy were
relief, recovery and reform.
   ``I recall well the revival of hope on the farm front that
accompanied passage of New Deal farm programs,'' he wrote.
``Farmers were given a role in working out their own chosen
solutions to their problems. They were put on committees by the
thousands. They elected officers, attended meetings and spoke their
minds.''
   Paarlberg added: ``Government checks began to flow. The
hemorrhage of farm foreclosures began to abate. On every hand was
evidence that the government cared. The Great Depression dragged
on, but the mood changed for the better on American farms.''
   But recovery was only partial seven years after passage of the
initial New Deal programs. Complete agricultural recovery from the
depression of the 1930s ``must ge credited more to the stimulus of
(World War II) than to management of supply and price,'' he said.
   Important traits of the New Deal programs persisted beyond their
usefulness, Paarlberg said.
   ``Reform was, for the greater part, aborted,'' he said. ``The
agricultural elite, generally the large landowners, managed to
retain most of the program benefits themselves rather than share
them with tenants or employees.
   The modern Farmers Home Administration, for example, is a
descendant of the Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security
Administration, agencies created to bring relief to impoverished
farmers.
   But the FmHA today ``has been co-opted by the agricultural
establishment,'' Paarlberg said.
   ``The New Deal farm programs, intended to lift average farm
income, actually widened the income gap between the top and bottom
economic groups,'' he said. ``Relief was achieved, recovery
occurred for other reasons, and reform miscarried.''
   In their modern form, government farm programs cannot be called
New Deal programs because ``they have been adopted by most of the
Republican farm politicians,'' Paarlberg said.
   ``As an observer, I can no longer find credible differences in
the Congress between the farm policies of the two major parties,''
he said.
   Yet, when programs persist so long, it can be virtually
impossible to root them out or even change them substantially.
   ``If the programs are to be cut back and reformed, the effort
will have to be applied from outside the farm sector,'' Paarlberg
said. ``The farm lobby will never discipline itself.''
