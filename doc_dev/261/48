Despite the fascination of the gloomy media and financial commentators with
the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the undoubted presence of many
warning signs, there is still no evidence to date that the industrial world
faces a slump on anything like that scale.
As the new London Business School Economic Outlook usefully reminds us,
combined output in the seven leading industrial economies rose by  1/2 per
cent in 1991 and a probable 1 per cent in 1992. This is certainly a slowdown
compared with an established trend growth rate of 2 or 3 per cent per annum
and creates obvious problems of rising joblessness.
But nothing that has so far happened is anything like the Great Depression,
when US output fell by a third and world trade diminished by more than
two-thirds in value terms. Despite all the new elements of financial unease,
the growth slowdown so far is of the same order as that of the early 1980s.
Even in the UK the estimated output drop of 3 to 4 per cent on both
occasions is less than half of what was seen in 1929-33.
The slowdown in the west, together with the genuinely depressed state of the
'former centrally planned economies' - a euphemism for the ex-Soviet Union
and its satellites - has been enough to put competitive markets under a
cloud, to provoke some sneaking sympathy in the west for Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's opponents in the military industrial complex, to bring back
into fashion itchy government interventionism, and to make the foreign
offices of the west afraid to say 'boo' to any unpleasant autocracy which
has done them the favour of placing arms orders.
Someone who is suspicious of this mood music and wants to cheer up in the
face of the Edinburgh summit should look, not backwards to the Great
Depression, but across to the other side of the world to the prospering
developing countries of eastern Asia, which have contracted out of the world
slowdown.
These do not, incidentally, now include Japan, which has acquired most of
the characteristics of the other Group of Seven industrial countries.
Japanese growth in 1992 is estimated to be around 1 1/2 to 2 per cent and
some leading Japanese economists expect a virtual standstill in 1993-94.
By contrast, the four Asian 'tigers' - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore - are all estimated to be growing by between 6 and 7 1/2 per cent
this year. Even the non-tiger countries are achieving a comparable
performance - China 5 1/2 per cent, Indonesia 6 1/2 per cent, Malaysia 7 1/2
per cent and Thailand 8 per cent. Only the Philippines has slowed to G7
growth rates.
The ability of Asian developing countries to contract out of the western
slowdown is not confined to the accidents of particular countries or years.
Nor does it just reflect the ability to make use of a rising population. GDP
per capita in all the Asian developing countries taken together has been
rising at least twice as rapidly as in the G7, both in the boom of the 1980s
and in the subsequent slowdown.
The mixed group of Middle Eastern and European (mostly southern European)
developing countries now also shows signs of outperforming the industrial
leaders. But, despite the improvement in some of the formerly heavily
indebted Latin American states, the region as a whole is still crawling;
southern Africa is, alas, still in absolute decline.
Asia's leading countries cover a great many different political and economic
systems. What they do seem to have in common is a willingness to use market
incentives (even in China), a well-established system of property rights
(unlike the former Soviet Union), a respect for technical training, a very
obvious work ethic and an increasing openness to trade.
The achievement of the Asian developing countries attracts public attention
when vulnerable American or European industries cry out for quotas or
anti-dumping duties. But they still do not figure sufficiently in the
general assessment of the world economy. This reflects the fact that the
countries labelled 'industrial' by the IMF still account for well over 70
per cent of world GDP. Asia's developing countries together account for only
just over 7 per cent.
But compound interest has its own logic. To make a stylised projection: let
us put together the Asian developing countries with those of the Middle East
and southern Europe. Let us say that they account for 10 per cent of world
GDP - a slight underestimate. Let us assume that all these countries
together can achieve a growth rate averaging 6 per cent per annum (in total,
not per capita). If the established industrial countries achieve only 2 per
cent, they will be overtaken by 'Asia' just after the year 2040, within the
lifetime of the majority of people now living. Even if western growth rates
buck up to 3 per cent or Asian growth rates are slightly lower, the catch-up
will come around 2060, still within within some people's lifetimes.
These divergences are discussed from an industrial point of view by Lord
Rees-Mogg in a thoughtful article in The Independent, published on Monday.
He presents the rise of the Asian economies as a threat to European
prosperity unless we all wake up and adopt more of the cultural
characteristics I listed in a previous paragraph. We should indeed accept
some of them selectively, but not out of fear. The growth of other areas of
prosperity is an opportunity more than a threat. It is extremely unlikely
that Asian citizens will forever want to pile up their export proceeds in
the form of yen, dollar or even Ecu notes on their walls - although if they
did it would be a pure gift to the G7.
Rees-Mogg talks of industrial costs 2 per cent of those in Europe. They can
only be low in some specific sectors because the general level of
productivity in their whole economies is still well beneath that of the
west. As general prosperity and productivity increase, so will real wages.
Lord Macaulay made a famous attack on those who advocated child labour to
counter the supposed competitive threats of that era. Other countries'
growth is beneficial, and trade should be and can be a form of rivalry
between companies rather than warfare between countries.
But my main point is that we need both to stop patting the Asian countries
on their heads as examples of successful development and to stop running
scared of their achievements, but instead to begin to take them into that
management, albeit minimal, of the world economy which even an international
market system requires.
