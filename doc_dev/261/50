FT  09 NOV 92 / Depressing growth prospect of a US-EC trade war

<TEXT>
THE WORLD ECONOMY is not suffering from a 1930s-style depression.
Nonetheless, the parallels between then and now are worrying, not least the
apparent willingness of US and EC governments to risk a collapse of the
world trading system and a descent into tit-for-tat protectionism.
A transatlantic trade war is not yet under way, but the signs are ominous.
US and EC negotiators are reported to be willing to keep talking to solve
the row over EC oilseed subsidies. But preparations for war are progressing.
The US has announced its intention to impose 200 per cent duties on Dollars
300m (Pounds 193.5m) of EC white wines and farm goods in a month. The French
trade minister, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, plans to ask the EC to compile a
list of US products for retaliation.
Would a US-EC trade war threaten a slide into a 1930s-style depression? The
Great Depression was undoubtedly prolonged and deepened by protectionism.
The Smoot-Hawley tariff, instituted by the US in 1930, sparked a rise in
tariff barriers in virtually every country, often reinforced by quantitative
restrictions. Protectionism combined with falling output and prices to cause
a spiralling collapse in the value of world trade. The value of world trade
collapsed from Dollars 3bn a month in January 1929 to less than Dollars 1bn
a month by 1933, as the chart shows.
There is still widespread disagreement about the underlying cause of the
Great Depression. Different explanations stress the collapse in demand
caused by the 1929 US stock market crash, the effects on confidence and the
availability of credit of the US banking crises of the early 1930s and the
combination of widespread debts and the deflationary monetary policies which
the gold standard exchange rate regime required in Europe, despite
contracting output and trade. The UK left the gold standard in September
1931 and subsequently experienced a considerably smaller output decline.
Yet the collapse in trade was not the root cause of the Depression. The US
suffered the deepest recession of any developed country - real US output
fell by a third - and its resort to protectionism was largely to blame for
spreading this contraction across the world. But trade played a small role
in the US decline. Exports constituted 7 per cent of gross national product
in 1929 and declined by 1.5 per cent of 1929 GNP over the next two years
while the real value of US GNP fell by 10 times more in the same period.
Despite the current gloom, the world economy is still a long way from
suffering an economic collapse on a 1930s scale. Between 1929 and 1932, the
GDP of the advanced developed countries fell by 17.1 per cent, world trade
in manufactures fell by 40 per cent and world prices fell by 6 per cent a
year. Developing countries were also badly affected. Between 1929 and 1932,
they suffered a 12 per cent fall in GDP. Output subsequently rose by 34 per
cent between 1932 and 1937 but trade expansion contributed only 6.6
percentage points of this growth, according to the World Bank.
Confidence today is certainly depressed in almost all developed countries,
while many countries have indebted consumers and banks with shaky balance
sheets. But the monetary authorities, at least in US and Japan and more
recently in the UK, have eased monetary policy, while world output, trade
and prices are rising.
But it is the eastern European countries that are suffering falls in output
and incomes on a depression scale. For these countries, and also for
developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America which saw their
average incomes per head fall in the 1980s, an outbreak of world
protectionism would be a disaster. The Bank expects rising real incomes per
head in Africa and Latin America as well as East Asia in the 1990s, but
these projections assume a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.
The world is not threatened by a depression to rival the 1930s'. Even so, a
trade war now would deepen the world's current economic problems. For
developed and developing countries alike, a descent into protectionism is a
depressing prospect.
