<LEADPARA>  Weakened by recession and drastic reductions in state and federal aid, cities
and counties around the country are shedding or slashing many services that
helped define their mission for decades.;    As mayors and governing bodies
try to balance their budgets for the 1992 fiscal year, which begins on July 1
for most, the reductions are epidemic.  </LEADPARA>

CITY, COUNTY BUDGET WOES SAID TO BE WORST

<TEXT>     Honolulu is cutting back on road repairs. Sacramento cannot open its new
main library. Salt Lake City cannot build a fire station for a growing
neighborhood. Houston is eliminating 111 hospital beds for indigent patients.
Bridgeport, Conn., plans to stop cleaning its streets on July 1 and may stop
guarding its beaches this summer.;    Not since the 1930s;  Urban experts and
mayors around the country say that not since the 1930s have so many cities
faced such crippling fiscal constraints or lack of federal, state and taxpayer
support. "Cities are facing the toughest times since the Great Depression,"
said Mayor Sidney Barthelemy of New Orleans, president of the National League
of Cities.;    Urban specialists confirm that bleak assessment and say the new
fiscal year will bring a huge shakeout in services. "The day of reckoning
cannot be put off any longer," said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Nelson
A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York in
Albany.;    But some welcome the reckoning. Daniel J. Mitchell, an economist
and senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington research
organization that stresses private enterprise, said the end of the boom of the
1980s would "hopefully force these governments to not waste so much money.";  
 The hardest-hit cities and counties are in the Northeast and Midwest, which
have lost tax revenue as jobs and businesses fall victim to the recession. But
Western and Southern cities are also struggling to meet the service demands of
growing populations.;    As cities raise taxes and cut spending, economists
fear that the money taken from consumers' pockets could inhibit recovery from
the recession.;    Driving out the middle class;  The service reductions and
tax increases are driving out middle-class residents, leaving behind people
with a greater share of social problems and needs, further adding to the
cities' burdens.;    This trend makes it harder and harder for cities to
muster the kind of broad political support that gave rise to federal
anti-poverty programs in the 1960s and revenue sharing in the 1970s.;    "I'm
pretty pessimistic," Nathan said.;    He and other experts say that cities
cannot possibly solve their social problems alone, but that no one wants to
help them until local officials prove they know what they are doing and can
spend money wisely.  </TEXT>
