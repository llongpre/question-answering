   The last time the United States had a recession,
bullets were flying in the Falkland Islands and Barney Clark was
preparing to get the world's first artificial heart.
   That was 1982, ancient history by economists' standards. In
November of that year, the economy began a powerful expansion that
is about to become the longest in U.S. peacetime history.
   Next month, barring calamity, the expansion will tie the
peacetime record set under George Washington from mid-1790 to
mid-1796. Economists do not foresee a recession until next year at
the earliest.
   The Mississippi River may have receded from its banks this
summer, but the 1980s economy just keeps rolling along, in spite of
bad weather, deficits and the worst stock market crash on record.
   On the afternoon of Oct. 19, 1987, with half a trillion dollars
in stock wealth suddenly evaporated, there were widespread fears
that the United States could be on the brink of another Great
Depression.
   Those fears are legitimized in a new study by Christina D. Romer
of the University of California at Berkeley, who concludes that the
uncertainty generated by the 1929 crash was indeed a major factor
in causing the Depression of the 1930s.
   ``Uncertainty is worse than knowing the truth, no matter how
bad,'' she quotes The Magazine of Wall Street as having said on
Nov. 30, 1929.
   What saved the economy from disaster a year ago were three main
things:
   _The Federal Reserve, which flubbed its job in the 1930s, had
the good sense this time to open the money spigots, allowing banks
to borrow freely and preventing the financial system from going
into gridlock.
   _Consumers kept spending, only slightly daunted by the crash.
One reason was obvious in retrospect. Most Americans don't own
stocks. Moreover, investors' losses in stock portfolios were offset
by gains in bonds, which rallied.
   _The economy withstood the crash because it was _ and is _
basically healthy. In October 1929, a recession had already begun.
   So, then, what caused Black Monday? The answer is simple: What
goes up must come down. Pumped up by greed and fantasy, the stock
market had gotten too high, especially in comparison to the larger
but less visible bond market, which competes for investors' dollars.
   Instead of adjusting to economic reality gradually, the way
theory says it should, the market plunged in a chaotic and
dangerous spiral that was exacerbated by computer-dictated selling
and breakdowns in the trading system.
   To be sure, those who say Oct. 19 was a warning thunderclap have
plenty of evidence on their side.
   The trade deficit is a persistent reminder that Americans still
aren't winning the battle of international commerce, even with a
devalued currency.
   In spite of a record expansion, regional recessions have
occurred in such places as Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia and
Michigan.
   Auto workers, steelworkers, farmers, miners, and oil drillers _
people who work with their hands _ have not fared well in the 1980s.
   The economy's high-tech transformation, although necessary to
meet foreign competition, is creating a mismatch between the jobs
that are available and the people who need work. At the bottom, a
small underclass seems mired in permanent poverty.
   Overall, living standards are rising, but more slowly than they
used to. That's because productivity improvements have slowed down,
for reasons that are not fully understood.
   U.S. productivity is growing at an anemic 0.2 percent annual
rate, compared with 0.7 percent in West Germany and 1.9 percent in
Japan, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
estimates.
   Most troubling, the United States has gone from the world's
largest creditor to its biggest debtor. ``Debt'' here is shorthand
for all sorts of foreign investments, including stocks, real estate
and companies.
   Optimists say foreign money will rebuild America the same way it
did in the 19th century, when London banks financed the railroads.
   Pessimists respond that America's foreign debt is the result of
foolish overspending that is going into consumption rather than
investment.
   All debt, including the kind Americans owe to each other, has
skyrocketed in the 1980s to more than 2.3 times the gross national
product, Bank Credit Analyst reported recently.
   Such a top-heavy debt ratio has not been seen since the
Depression.
   For all the legitimate complaints about the health of the
economy, though, it is undeniable that growth is better than
recession, which causes human misery while leaving productive
resources wastefully unused.
   In September 1982, the tail end of the last recession, the
jobless rate peaked at a 42-year high of 10.1 percent. Today
unemployment and inflation are bouncing between 5 percent and 6
percent.
   While Europe has stagnated and Japan's world-beating growth has
slowed down, the United States has created 15.5 million jobs since
President Reagan's inauguration.
   Economists can't agree why the United States has managed to
avoid recession for so long. One prominent idea, which might be
called the Kneejerk Theory, gives credit to the fast reflexes of
the bond market.
   The Kneejerk Theory says bond holders have learned to panic at
any sign of 1970s-style inflation. When the economy shows signs of
overheating, they dump bonds. That drives up interest rates, which
dampens the economy, preventing an inflationary spiral that would
lead to a crash.
   The Deficit Theory says the United States is able to avoid a
recession-inducing runup in interest rates because it is financing
its high level of spending with foreign borrowing _ trouble in the
long run.
   According to the New Age Theory, investments in labor-saving
equipment to cope with the coming labor shortage will allow the
United States to enjoy both low inflation and a low jobless rate.
Aging baby boomers will jack up the low U.S. savings rate.
   Finally there is the Luck Theory, which explains fortunate
events ranging from the drop in the dollar, which rejuvenated
exports, to the stock market crash itself, which knocked down
interest rates just as they were getting prohibitively high.
   When a recession finally does hit, it will be unusually severe
because of the likelihood of rippling defaults on the record
mountains of debt. Consider that farm banks and the savings and
loan industry are in trouble even without a nationwide recession.
   The federal budget deficit, already high, will skyrocket in a
recession as tax receipts fall and spending goes up.
   With the United States removed as an engine of world growth, any
downturn here is likely to spread to Latin America and could extend
to Western Europe and the Far East.
   There are plenty of causes for concern. But then, there always
are. In comparison to what people feared last October, things are
looking surprisingly good.
