   The outbreak of World War II half a century ago
helped put American farmers on the high-tech course they follow
today. And it bailed them out of the Great Depression.
   Market prices for most commodities crept up in the months
following Germany's Sept. 1, 1939, invasion of Poland. The price of
horses, however, barely moved.
   President Roosevelt's secretary of agriculture, Henry A. Wallace,
advised farmers to proceed with 1940 production plans ``as if the
outbreak in Europe had not occurred.''
   The farm price of cotton in August 1939 averaged 8.7 cents per
pound. Corn brought less than 48 cents a bushel, and wheat was about
55 cents nationally, on the average.
   Horses were reported by USDA in the month before the start of
World War II at $78 per head.
   Six months later, in February 1940, the department reported the
farm prices of cotton at 9.97 cents per pound, corn at 55 cents a
bushel, and wheat at 84 cents per bushel.
   Horses gained only 20 cents, averaging $78.20 each in February
1940.
   Early predictions of demand for farm products remained guarded.
   ``European war has not stimulated, it has diminished, the export
demand for farm products,'' the March 1940 report said. ``United
States exports of tobacco and fruits have been greatly reduced.
   ``Exports of pork and lard are not up to the volume that would
flow normally in a year of large production and low prices. Export
sales of cotton have been good but have declined recently. Little
wheat is going abroad.''
   Some increases in U.S. domestic demand were reported as war
clouds deepened. But U.S. industrial production had not yet geared
up, and the outlook for agriculture was clouded.
   ``There seems little in the picture now that would justify any
expansion in farm production this year (1940) in excess of domestic
_ plus limited export _ needs for foods and fibers,'' USDA
economists intoned.
   But in May 1940, after the fall of France and as Britain's
tattered army prepared for its evacuation from Dunkirk, the USDA's
analysts reported:
   ``News comes of a quick change in the European political front
and yeast of commodity speculation rises. Wheat goes to highest
prices in three years, feed grains follow, hog prices climb, too.''
   Massive U.S. aid to Britain, including food and clothing, and a
buildup in American military forces would gradually put the United
States on a war footing. Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, settled any
remaining doubts.
   Doug Bowers, the department's historian, says World War II
brought epic changes to American agriculture.
   Since World War I in 1914-18, the main problem in U.S.
agriculture had been over-production, he said in a telephone
interview. But with the 1939-45 conflict, ``they needed full
production for wartime,'' Bowers said.
   ``This coincided with a very important change in American
agriculture,'' he said. ``That was the widespread adoption of
chemicals _ fertilizer and pesticides _ and also the continued
mechanization of agriculture.''
   The war didn't contribute directly to mechanization, simply
because factories that normally turned out tractors and combines
were building guns and tanks.
   ``But in the Midwest, for example, farmers who had never
fertilized before at all began using fertilizer on crops,'' Bowers
said. ``It began a long trend in upward productivity in American
agriculture.''
   There were domestic price controls and rationing during World War
II, he said. Even so, there was inflation as families sought
products for wartime incomes.
   ``The farmer came out of World War II in better economic shape
than he'd been in for a quarter of a century, since the end of World
War I,'' Bowers said.
   As the war drew to a close, there was some concern that
agriculture might suffer the same kind of collapse that happened in
the 1920s _ a harbinger of the Great Depression _ when the farm
economy was burdened by the loss of wartime markets and high prices.
   Government price supports were kept at relatively high levels
through World War II and for some time afterward, just in case, he
said. But U.S. aid to a war-torn world required a large output by
farmers. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 also was a factor.
   ``It wasn't until the mid-1950s that surpluses were a serious
problem again,'' Bowers said.
   By February 1943, with the allied invasion of Nazi-held Europe
still more than a year away, the economists at USDA noted that
``food production was expanded greatly'' in 1942 and that more was
needed.
   ``When the great victory drives in Europe and the Far East get
under way, food production will become more and more important in
relation to other war production,'' they said. ``Food requirements
will become acute with the liberation of Axis-occupied territories.''
   The report also showed the farm price of cotton at 19.7 cents per
pound, corn at 88 cents per bushel, and wheat at $1.18 per bushel.
   Horses were not included in the February 1943 agricultural
situation report. Tanks and tractors had taken their toll.
