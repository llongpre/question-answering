NINETEEN NINETY-TWO SEES ELECTIONS IN THE UK AND US. WILL THERE BE A LABOUR
GOVERNMENT IN BRITAIN?
Joe Rogaly writes: Possibly. The answer would be 'probably' if Labour had
not done so badly in 1987. If Mr Neil Kinnock is to become prime minister
with an overall majority at his command Labour needs to capture close to 100
parliamentary seats from the Tories, many of them in the south-east. This
would require a huge swing from the government to the opposition, the likes
of which has not previously been achieved.
Against that, the Tories will be bereft of their present overall majority if
they lose just 50 seats. Most would go to Labour, but some would go to the
Liberal Democrats. No single party would have a majority in the commons.
Parliament would be hung. The consequences of that are unpredictable. If the
Conservatives remained the largest party they might try to win the support
of the Ulster unionists, but not all of them could be counted on. To do a
deal with the Liberal Democrats on a promise of proportional representation
would require a historic U-turn by Mr John Major. His party might not accept
it.
Thus the Tories might try to hang on to No 10 Downing Street by their
fingertips. They could easily fail. Labour would then have to be given a
chance to cobble together a coalition. If Labour was the largest party it
would form a government and try to win popularity in time for an early
second election.
All of this presupposes that the economy will not show perceptible signs of
recovery. If there are signs of recovery, the Conservatives' winter of
discontent would be forgotten. Mr Major would win his mandate. All bets for
Labour would be off.
AND IN THE US, WILL GEORGE BUSH BE BEATEN?
Lionel Barber writes: No, but he will have a run for his money. President
Bush won the 1988 election because he buried a weak liberal candidate with
the slogan: 'Experienced leadership for America's future'. Mr Bush will
repeat the message in 1992, but he will find it a much tougher sell.
Americans are in a sullen mood, disillusioned with their political leaders
and worried about the future.
The recent slump in Mr Bush's approval rating stems directly from the sharp
drop in public confidence in an early recovery. Mr Bush, who promised to
create 30m jobs as president, has seen total civilian employment actually
fall during his first three years in office. Unless he can point to tangible
signs of an upturn by late summer, Mr Bush remains vulnerable.
Whether he is beatable depends, to some extent, on which Democratic
candidate emerges from the six-strong field. The absence of Governor Mario
Cuomo of New York means that the Democrats do not have a national figure to
field against Mr Bush: Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early
Democratic front-runner, has never run in a presidential campaign; Senator
Tom Harkin of Iowa is all gnashing teeth and clenched fists; Senator Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, the telegenic Vietnam war hero, sounds a lot like Mr
Gary Hart in 1984 and may fizzle in similar fashion.
The poor performance of the US economy offers Democrats their first chance
in 20 years to recapture the ethnic blue-collar vote. This will help the
party in the north, but not necessarily in the south which remains solidly
Republican. Other factors helping the Democrats are Mr Bush's restive
conservative wing and the fact that the communist threat will no longer
dominate debate.
But Mr Bush's patrician tendencies obscure his skills as a political
street-fighter. It may be a close election, but at this stage a Democrat win
still looks less than likely.
WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY? ARE WE IN A GREAT DEPRESSION LIKE THAT OF THE EARLY
1930S?
Samuel Brittan writes: I am often asked this question by broadcasters. When
I answer with a resounding 'No', I am usually asked if I know of any other
commentator willing to answer 'Yes'. The macho-pessimistic view is of course
contradicted by the most cursory examination of the facts. Between the Wall
Street crash of 1929 and the bottom of the depression in 1933, US output
fell by 30 per cent, and money incomes fell by 50 per cent. The fall was
nearly as large in Germany. In Britain there was no Great Depression as such
but a 6 per cent fall in output after an incomplete recovery in the 1920s -
the incompleteness is conventionally ascribed to Winston Churchill's return
to gold at the wrong parity, a diagnosis which some economic historians are
beginning to question.
This constant harping on the Great Depression is an enemy of serious
thinking. So is the obsession with prediction at the expense of
understanding and policy analysis. Hardly anyone has responded to my
invitation to discuss whether a temporary setback to economic activity to
allow consumers and businesses to repay what they feel to be excessive debt
is healthy or dangerous; or at what point it changes from one to the other.
Both Keynes and Milton Friedman have a great deal to answer for in their
preoccupation with aggregate levels of output and prices and with
unattainable stabilisation goals. We are unlikely to learn more about
business cycles without returning to the study of the relative behaviour of
different sectors, industries, and even companies - a study which will have
to be taken up from where it was abandoned in the early 1930s.
As for policy: the New Year is a time for restating one obvious truth. This
is that governments and central banks would be in a much better position to
use monetary policy, public works programmes, and the like, to combat
recession if they were starting out from a record of reasonable price
stability and budgets which were not too far from balance. Our present
predicament springs in large part from the needless overthrow in
non-emergency contexts of the 'old-time religion' of sound money by a
coalition of right-wing Reaganites and left-of-centre growth merchants.
WILL THE VALUE OF SHARES RISE?
Barry Riley writes: Sentiment in the stock market was so bad for most of
December that it was scarcely surprising that Christmas week brought
something of a bounce back. This might continue for a while in January,
usually a good month for share prices.
However, there are a lot of hazards ahead. Wall Street is vulnerable to
shocks if the US economy continues to lag, and in Europe the Bundesbank is
determined to beat German inflation, if necessary at the expense of reducing
economic growth across Europe as a whole to a crawl.
In the UK the election is likely to generate a lot of volatility. The
prospect of a Labour government would scare investors, although they would
probably recover their nerve to a large extent after the event.
In general share prices are well-supported by dividend yields averaging over
5 per cent, but a lot of dividends are going to be cut in 1992 so individual
share prices could go in all sorts of directions. Meanwhile profits are
generally weak, and recent hopes of a recovery in company earnings have
turned out to be premature.
All in all, you are likely to make some money on shares over 1992 taken as a
whole, but you will need to pick stocks with care, because there are going
to be further individual company shocks, and you may also need strong nerves
at times. The ride might be a little safer and less volatile in government
securities.
WILL THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM BE
REALIGNED?
Martin Wolf writes: Yes.  1992 will see the European Community tide ebbing
fast:
Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty will provoke debates in countries as
far removed in their attitudes to the EC as Germany and the UK.
Completion of the 1992 programme will be painfully difficult; its economic
effects will be disappointing.
The debate between the economically liberal north and the interventionist
south will reach new peaks of intensity. The attempt to construct a common
foreign policy will founder on irreconcilable differences of interest among
the EC's major countries.
And the ERM will be realigned.
Realignments are most likely to be confined to Italy and the UK acting, as
over the Western European Union, in concert. The Bundesbank will lower
interest rates, but too little, too late, to avoid another year of slow
European growth, this time including Germany.
Complaints about German fiscal and monetary policies will become ever more
outspoken, but they will have no influence upon the German reality. The
desperate plight of, first and foremost, eastern Germany and then eastern
Europe and the new Commonwealth of Independent States, will continue to
exclude everything else from German politics.
For Germany's partners the decision by the Bank of Japan that it will have
to lower rates of interest aggressively will be the final straw. Thereupon,
Italy will realise that being chained to the Bundesbank's cross makes no
sense for a country that will not be allowed into economic and monetary
union anyway; and the UK will realise that the only escape from debt
deflation will be a nice dose of inflation. By the end of the year the path
to Emu will look even more difficult and the destination even more doubtful
than it does today.
WILL THERE BE CIVIL WAR IN WHAT USED TO BE THE SOVIET UNION?
John Lloyd writes: The best answer is: no, but there are already. This
Russian answer means that there will be no civil war, but there are civil
wars, there will probably be more and there will probably be civil
disorders. The relative confidence with which civil war - usually thought of
in a grand sense of ignorant armies clashing by night across vast
territories - is dismissed is because the dispossessed lack the stomach for
such a full-scale fight.
The dispossessed are of course the communists, and history has far too
comprehensively passed them by to allow them to revive and to lead a
revolution, or rather a reaction, in its name. Most of the active ones are
making co-operatives, commodity exchanges and joint ventures as fast as
their address books can carry them. The only flag they will now follow is
green, and has Washington's head on it.
In the Caucasus, struggles over the control of territory are intensifying:
so far, these have not been reproduced (except in Moldova), but 1992 will be
a lucky year if they are not. There are border issues everywhere, around and
within Russia, waiting for a stupid demagogue to make it a dispute. More
worryingly, there are minorities everywhere, which had been used to moving
about freely in a Soviet state, who now or will soon face citizenship laws,
visa restrictions and rising nationalism, and are frightened and defensive.
There have been few food riots (reported) yet: but if they start happening
in a large way then they will spread quickly. In the fragilely-governed
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the political choice
will often be seen to be between a promise-everything populism and a
stop-everything crackdown. Neither can be more than palliatives.
But the war of one side against the other - whites against reds, or blacks
against whites - is unlikely this coming year. No one has the time, or can
afford to lose that place in the queue.
AND IN YUGOSLAVIA, WILL THE SERBS AND CROATS SHAKE HANDS AND MAKE UP?
Judy Dempsey writes: No. If the Croats regain full control of their
territory, this will not end the fighting. Although the Serb-dominated
federal army might eventually leave Croatia, a new kind of war - guerrilla
warfare - will develop, thanks to the depths of hatred between the two
communities.
Spare a thought for what will happen in the other republics.
The ethnic Albanians in the Serbian-controlled province of Kosovo are likely
to discard their passivity and rise up against Serbia. In the
ethnnically-mixed central republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, the Moslems will
take up arms against any attempt by Serbia and the federal army to divide
the republic, while Bosnia's Croats, who are concentrated mostly in western
Hercegovina, will try to unite with Croatia. In Macedonia, the 56,000 Serbs,
urged on by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, will resist
moves by the republic to seek independence, while Macedonia's 400,000 ethnic
Albanians will demand more ethnic rights, and possibly unite with their
confreres in Kosovo.
WILL ARABS AND ISRAELIS SIGN A PEACE TREATY?
Roger Matthews writes: No. But world events in 1991 have made it much more
likely that eventually they will be forced to do so. The writing is already
on the wall. Peace talks will resume in Washington on January 7, despite the
failure of the last round in December. The willingness to continue is tied
to the disappearance of the Soviet Union, to the crushing of Iraq, and to
consequent US military and political dominance in the Middle East.
Israel's Arab opponents have been stripped of their most important military
supplier and international ally. The military superiority of Israel, backed
by nuclear weapons, has never been greater. The last chance the Arab
countries have of regaining land captured in 1967, and the Palestinians of
embarking on the path to self-rule, is through diplomacy.
The present government of Israel prefers the status quo to any alternative
suggested by the Arabs, or by the US and the EC. For so long as Mr Yitzhak
Shamir is prime minister, it will use every delaying tactic it can devise,
while emphasising its commitment to the peace process.
What seems obvious to others is rarely so clear in the Middle East. Patience
is crucial. Long-entrenched prejudices, blind bigotry, religious extremism,
economic deprivation and individual political ambition are powerful forces
working against any appreciation of strategic change. Saddam Hussein lives.
WILL CHINESE COMMUNISM SURVIVE?
Alexander Nicoll writes: Yes. Communism will not collapse. The world awaits
the death of the Chinese party's octogenerian leadership, and especially
that of Deng Xiaoping, its 87-year-old patriarch. But even if qigong, their
exercise, breathing and meditation routine, fails to keep them going for
another year, the party is most unlikely to prove a house of cards like
those in the former Soviet bloc.
Rapid economic growth, fostered by market-oriented reforms of a distinctly
non-communist nature, serves paradoxically to preserve the party's power.
The party has not solved the fundamental problem of how to deal with
dinosaur loss-making state industries. They provide massive employment as
well as building blocks for the party's own structure. But the party is
happy to see the tremendous growth of non-state enterprise - particularly in
the area surrounding its future dominion, Hong Kong - always provided that
its political dominance is not thrown into question.
In the longer term, the growth of ideas inevitably associated with the
growth of the market economy seems bound to pose that question, and to
create north-south tensions. But for the time being, the octogenarians and
their successors seem set to hang on.
WILL THE URUGUAY ROUND OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS SUCCEED?
Martin Wolf writes: Yes. But agreement will make things little better. Even
in the pivotal area, agriculture, the gulf between the positions of the two
main players, the EC and the US, is too small for continued disagreement to
be sustainable.
What is more, the final agreement will be ratified, even by the US Congress.
That body of politically craven opportunists will huff and will puff, but it
will not blow the Gatt house down.
What Congress will do, instead, is charge a high price. That price - more
regionalism and, above all, more unilateralism - will help to ensure that
the Uruguay Round makes only a limited difference. It will be seen, in
retrospect, as a brilliant and largely successful holding operation rather
than as a decisive move towards what the world most needs: a more liberal
trading environment.
WILL THERE BE A MAJOR INITIATIVE TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT?
David Lascelles writes: The auguries for the first Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro in June, are not encouraging. This huge UN-sponsored jamboree is
intended to be the biggest green initiative ever. If it succeeds, it should
establish policies to secure the world's environment well into the next
century: an Earth Charter, and an Agenda 21.
But so far, only a handful of leaders from more than 100 countries have said
they will go. The arrangements for this enormous affair are also straining
Rio's resources to the limit.
But even if the summit risks producing more hot air than action, it should
still focus the world's minds on the big environmental issues. High on the
agenda will be protection of the atmosphere, safeguards for the world's
biological diversity, transfer of technology to polluting countries, and
stronger financial commitments to supporting these worthy goals.
WHAT ABOUT ME? WILL THE PRICE OF MY HOUSE GO UP?
John Plender writes: An acceptable question in the roaring '80s, but wholly
unsuitable in the non-permissive, debt-laden world of the '90s. The correct
question today is whether the price of your house will go down; and the
answer, with regional variations, is that it almost certainly will.
The thing that has not changed between the decades is the capacity of the
housing market to deliver sharp swings in house prices in relation to
earnings. What is new is the way that the market brings about the adjustment
to equilibrium after a period of monetary excess. In the early 1980s
inflation diminished the pain.
In the 1990s the government's commitment to disinflation and to maintaining
sterling within the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) means that this
inflationary escape route is barred. A personal sector that has seen its
debt-to-income ratio double over the past decade thanks to financial
deregulation now faces the highest real rates of interest since the 1930s.
The return to equilibrium is thus being achieved through a combination of
increased earnings and falling nominal house prices.
Do not rule out an increase in mortgage rates. Even in an election year a
sterling crisis would make this inescapable. And do not blame Norman Lamont
 -it was John Major who pinned his colours to disinflation and the ERM while
at the Treasury.
