   Frightened by the firestorm that swept through the stock market yesterday, investors seeking a haven rushed to put their money in the safest and stodgiest investments around: U.S. Treasury bills. 

   "This was Black Monday," said George J. Collins, president of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore. 
"You always wondered what it was like back in 1929. 
Now we know." 

   As stocks crashed, Treasury bond prices fell sharply early in the day but roared back late to wind up with huge gains in heavy trading. 
Some actively traded 30-year Treasury issues soared more than three points, or over $30 for each $1,000 face amount, as their yield dropped to about 9.8% from 10.19% Friday. 

   The bond market's extraordinary rally came as investors concluded that the stock market upheaval could indicate the economy is heading for a painful slump that would mean sharply lower inflation and interest rates. 
The stock market disaster "is frightening because it conjures up fears of recession and depression," said Ralph F. Peters, chairman of Discount Corp. of New York, a large government securities dealer. 
"It sure knocked out inflationary psychology in a hurry." 

   Mr. Collins agreed. 
"This could easily kick us into a recession," he said. 
In such a situation, yields of nearly 10% on U.S. government notes and bonds would "sure look attractive." 

   The stock market disaster "clearly has serious recessionary overtones," said Jon S. Corzine, partner in charge of fixed-income trading at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
"That means the Fed, as opposed to worrying about inflation, will swing -- and I think justifiably so -- to more serious concerns about the well-being of the economy. 
That, at least, was what the bond market was expressing today." 

   When fear grips the financial markets, as it did yesterday, many investors flee to Treasury bills as a haven because the bills are short-term, backed by the government, and can be converted into cash easily. 
The rush produced a surge in bill prices and thus an extraordinarily sharp drop in bill rates. 
For example, three-month Treasury bill rates plunged about half a percentage point from Friday's closing levels. 

   "This was a debacle. 
What we saw was a full-blown flight to quality," said Bruce R. Lakefield, executive vice president of Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. "There's a lack of confidence in the administration and the Federal Reserve, and investors are voting with their money." 

   Fear of war in the Middle East also swirled through the financial markets, further encouraging investors to head for safety. 
Adding to the bond market's huge rally was a sharp drop in commodity prices that investors monitor as indicators of the inflation outlook. 

   "The stock market collapse increases the likelihood of a recession before year end because consumer confidence and spending are bound to be depressed," said Edward E. Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
That plus the drop in commodity prices could add up to deflation, he said, "and there is nothing bond investors like better than deflation." 

   Corporate bonds also posted strong advances, although dealers said trading was light. 

   Another factor that helped bolster the bond market was the Treasury's announcement that Secretary James Baker had met with West German officials. 
The Treasury said the meeting was "very positive" and that the two nations have agreed to work together to promote exchange-rate and monetary stability. 

   Some analysts contended that the Treasury announcement amounted merely to a public relations effort to calm the markets. 
Nevertheless, the dollar staged a late rally that helped buoy bond prices. 

   The stock market collapse probably will force the Federal Reserve to forget about any credit-tightening moves and to focus its efforts on keeping the economy afloat, several analysts agreed. 
Milton Friedman and other economists have heaped blame on the Federal Reserve for exacerbating the Great Depression through monetary policy errors. 

   "This is a financial crisis," said Albert A. Gross, chief economist and senior vice president at Refco Inc. 
"It would be inappropriate for the Fed to tighten" credit because such a move "would exacerbate the fears and panic environment the stock market is currently in." 

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan is scheduled to speak today in Dallas at an American Bankers Association conference. 
The Fed's vice chairman, Manuel Johnson, is slated to speak in New York this evening at a meeting of the Money Marketeers of New York University. 
Robert Ried, president of Ried Thunberg &amp; Co. and president of the Money Marketeers of NYU, said the Johnson dinner is "fully booked." 

   Mr. Ried said "there was heavy trading going on" in the Treasury bond market yesterday. 
By some estimates, the 30-year Treasury bond posted its largest advance since mid-August 1982. 

   Among actively traded issues, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 were quoted late yesterday at a price of 91 1/32, up sharply from 87 25/32 Friday. 
The yield fell to 9.81% from 10.19%. 
The issue traded as high as 91 31/32 to yield 9.70% -- and as low as 85 27/32 to yield 10.42%. 
Dealers said that was one of the widest swings in recent memory. 

   The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 rose to 93 25/32 from 90 23/32 Friday. 
The yield fell to 9.61% from 10.14%. 

   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds jumped 22.14 points to 1152.47. 
It finished only slightly below its highest level of the day of 1153.17. 
The low was 1109.08. 
But the index closed at about 5 p.m. EDT, and thus didn't reflect much of the bond market's powerful surge that came later. 

   The federal funds rate averaged 7.62%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) 
Inc. Friday, the rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 7.55% after averaging 7.59% in the week ended Wednesday. 

   The Treasury sold new 13-week bills yesterday at an average rate of 6.84% and new 26-week bills at an average of 7.21%. 
Here are the details of that auction: 

   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. 
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. 
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.
