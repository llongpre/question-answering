FT  20 JUL 92 / Don't look for gurus

Anyone foolish enough to look on British economists as gurus should have
been thoroughly disillusioned by the contributions of eight economists
published in the FT on Saturday on whether leaving the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism would 'help Britain'.
Of these, three said 'yes', four said 'maybe', and one, Peter Spencer of
Kleinwort, was brave enough to give a forthright 'no', saying that if the UK
left the ERM, overseas investors would 'find it difficult to believe the
word of the UK government in the future'.
I am not so concerned about the three downright 'yes' answers. Patrick
Minford has always opposed the ERM, and Wynne Godley at least the hard
counterinflationary version. I am more concerned about the four 'maybes'.
Two of these concentrate on predictions rather than giving their own opinion
and are mainly anxious not to be caught by events. Another says the UK was
right to join in 1990, but should soon contemplate departure.
One 'maybe', David Currie, of the London Business School, comes near in his
admittedly very summarised FT contribution to advocating an alternative
package of devaluation plus deep public spending cuts and an independent
Bank of England, the day after he had a letter in The Times cogently
attacking the anti-ERM Liverpool Six. It is, of course, extremely unlikely
that the government would make the Bank independent if it were forced out of
the ERM. (One wit in that institution asked me: 'Would an independent Bank
be able to rejoin the ERM?')
I am reminded of the famous protest by 364 economists after the 1981 Budget.
They all agreed that there were alternatives to government policy, but did
not dare say what they were, lest their apparent unity crumbled. Some of
them indeed advocated joining the ERM] But you can take it that almost any
imaginable economic policy - certainly one pursued by a Conservative
government - would have a majority of British economists against it.
There is a case for floating rates and a case for a quasi-fixed rate
arrangement, like the ERM. The virtues of both systems, as of macro-economic
policies in general, are much exaggerated. But what is truly contemptible is
the British habit of not being willing to stay with any set of policies,
even for a short time, without hankering after another panacea.
What is it fundamentally that prevents the economy moving towards a full
employment equilibrium without inflation? The answer of Keynes was that the
rate of interest got stuck at too high a level. That may have had some
validity in the deflationary years of the Great Depression in the early
1930s. Unfortunately, it was wrongly assumed to be true by a large part of
the postwar economic establishment when the price that has been out of
kilter has been that of labour.
In what conceivable sense are we in a deflation or depression, when the
national income in money terms is rising by some 5 per cent per annum or
more, as it is in most industrial countries, and when a 6 1/2 per cent rate
of earnings increase in the UK after nearly two years of falling output and
employment is regarded as a triumph of moderation? Instead of speaking as if
some exchange rate regime, other than the one we happen to be in, was the
clue to prosperity, economists could more usefully investigate why
businesses are so keen to cut employment, but so reluctant to cut pay and
prices at the slightest sign of trouble. It would be refreshing if
devaluationists began their expositions by explaining that their favoured
measure works, if it works at all, by reducing real wages.
If any country has the right to complain of high real interest rates imposed
by the Bundesbank it is France. That country has a genuinely lower rate of
inflation than Britain - 3 per cent, compared with an underlying 4.7 per
cent - and therefore correspondingly higher real interest rates. Yet,
British opinion takes a lead in the grumbling.
For Britain even to contemplate departing from the ERM while France remains
is simply another instance of the devaluation urge, which has brought the
pound from DM11 in the mid 1960s to less than DM3 today. Each time sterling
fell, there was a plausible short-term rationalisation, but the end result
has been a much higher rate of inflation than Germany with no offsetting
gains in output and jobs.
I am constantly being asked if there are any circumstances in which it might
be right to leave the ERM, and, if I give the honest 'yes' answer, to say by
what date I would contemplate leaving. Such an approach would most likely
lead to throwing in the towel, just before subsequent statistics show that
the country was beginning to come out of recession.
There are alternatives to sticking with it, but they are a great deal worse.
If you want a long-term view, do not ask a sample of economists, still less
a sample of those who have made their names familiar to a wider public.
