   Your Aug. 8 article "Believers in One Wave Theory See U.S.
in Deep Trough Soon" fairly described the long-cycle theory
propounded by the late Russian economist Nikolai Kondratieff.
   But Kondratieff's theories probably cost him his life. It
did not please Stalin to hear that Western capitalism would
inevitably emerge from the economic trough that began in 1929
and continued into the 1930s. Stalin's ideology held that the
Great Depression was the death rattle of capitalism and that
Soviet socialism would prevail.

   For this reason, and allegations of "rightist deviation,"
Stalin had Kondratieff arrested in 1930. The hapless
economist soon disappeared within the Gulag system, where he
presumably perished in the early 1930s.
   Clearly, Stalin took ideas seriously.
