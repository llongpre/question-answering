   Maurice Allais was a shrewd choice for the first Nobel prize in economics awarded a French national. 
He was present at the creation, so to speak, of post-war France, a nation that tried to combine a tradition of dirigisme, or state intervention, with market forces. 
But throughout he retained the coloration of an old-fashioned free-market man. 
A product of the grandes ecoles that produced the French establishment, he remained a critic of the establishment -- and it remained aloof from him. 
The Nobel award, a free-market friend of ours cried with delight, will come as "a shock to the Paris nomenclatura." 

   Professor Allais's works are highly mathematical and technical. 
Now 77, he published "In Search of an Economic Discipline" in 1943, and "Economy and Interest" in 1947. 
The chairman of the awarding committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Assar Lindbeck, said Mr. Allais had been under consideration for a long time but that "it took a long time to investigate him because of the great volume and complexity of his works." 
The news wires quote Jacques Lautman of France's National Center for Scientific Research as saying Mr. Allais's work provided "a very strong base for those opposed to government direction of the economy, by establishing a link between the equilibrium of the many individual decisions and maximal efficacy." 

   The news clipping about Professor Allais's latest policy comments that caught our eye was a column by the ever-vigilant Paul Fabra of Le Monde. 
Published less than a month after the October 19 market crash in 1987, the column was headlined: "Maurice Allais foresaw the enormity of the crash." 
Mr. Fabra quoted a paper Mr. Allais had written that April saying the situation "presents three fundamental analogies with that which preceded the Great Depression of 1929-1934: a great development of promises to pay, frenetic speculation, and a resulting potential instability in credit mechanisms, that is, financing long-term investments with short-term deposits." 
Mr. Fabra quoted Mr. Allais as saying that salvation can come only through a monetary reform for which governments aren't yet ready. 
The Nobel prize may encourage them to listen.
