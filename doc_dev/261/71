Of a 1988 Recession, Despite Market Tumult

   Even with yesterday's rebound, you might wonder whether the market's worst plunge since the advent of the Great Depression is telling us to get ready for a recession, at the very least. 

   While some Wall Street analysts and money managers do see a recession in the cards for 1988, what's surprising is how many believe it won't necessarily happen. 

   (It should be noted that few of these savants correctly predicted Monday's cataclysm. 
But that doesn't mean their current thoughts should be totally disregarded.) 

   One factor that will help the economy is yesterday's steep drop in interest rates, the product of both expected slower economic growth and the indication by the Federal Reserve that it will turn on the money tap to help prevent a 1929-style economic crash. 

   Steven Einhorn, investment policy co-chairman at Goldman Sachs, believes the odds are 2 to 1 in favor of a recession, because of the consumer spending slowdown he believes is likely to result from the big reduction in net worth caused by this month's market crash. 

   Mr. Einhorn, who did recommend clients raise cash and reduce stock positions in early September, says a slowdown could result in a 5% drop in 1988 corporate profits. 

   Goldman had been estimating earnings of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index would rise to $20.90 in 1988 from $17.20 in 1987. 
A 5% drop would bump those earnings back down to $16.25 -- as of yesterday, Goldman's new estimate -- a pretty big swing in expectations. 

   If there isn't a recession, Mr. Einhorn believes stocks are fairly valued. 
But if there is, he thinks they could well fall a further 15%. 
One way or another, he still considers bonds a better buy. 

   Stanley Salvigsen, former market strategist at Merrill Lynch and now chairman of Comstock Partners, is a bit more optimistic. 
He believes interest rates have peaked for now. 
"Maybe the severity of (stocks') decline is signaling that the economic outlook isn't as rosy as it was. 
But I don't think it's the harbinger of a catastrophic recession," he added. 

   While Mr. Salvigsen believes sluggish consumer spending will hold economic growth to 1.5% next year, he believes the industrial, energy and farm sectors of the economy can continue "creeping forward." 
He believes the stock market "may be seeing its lows right here that set you up for an up year next year." 

   Bill Harnisch, president of ForstmannLeff Associates, a New York money manager, says the stock bloodbath has prompted his firm to lower its economic growth assumption for 1988 from 2% to 4% to 0% to 2% -- slow growth but no recession. 
But he still expects a 10% increase in corporate profits because the dollar will continue to help cyclical companies. 

   Still, he acknowledged, "This has to affect auto sales. 
I'll bet you (that) BMW dealers were empty today. 
And you'll find a lot of New York City apartments for sale" by refugees from the financial shakeout. 

   Mr. Harnisch added, "I talked to two companies today, and they both told me the same thing: If anybody thinks the stock market doesn't affect the economy, they should have sat in on our meetings where we told everybody to start cutting back on spending." 

   Barton Biggs, managing director of Morgan Stanley, dismisses the interpretation of the stock market decline as an evil omen: "I don't think the market is telling us anything about (a possible recession). 
We're just having an old-time classic selling panic." 

   Mr. Biggs believes that even if the market keeps falling, that could result in "a big shakeout in the financial economy without having much effect on the real economy." 
He believes central-bank monetary easing will offset lower consumer confidence, and jokes, "The market has forecast nine of the past five recessions." 

   Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns, doesn't see the sort of 25% declines in industrial commodity prices that would signal a recession. 
Those prices are only off 5% to 7% from their recent highs. 
Another missing recession indicator: an inverted yield curve, with shortterm interest rates spiking up higher than long-term rates. 

   Brett Brubaker, managing partner at Abraham &amp; Sons, a Chicago advisory firm, says that, while "the market is telling you the chances are pretty good for a recession," he believes many stocks are good buys now because the crisis will galvanize political leaders to act to help the economy. 

   Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, doubts the odds of a recession next year are greater than 50-50, but said Merrill will certainly have to reduce its economic growth estimates. 
He said lower interest rates mean inflation fears are easing, but many consumers will postpone big purchases, and many businesses will defer new projects. 

   David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's, is even more optimistic. 
He puts the chance of recession at only 25%. 

   Still, one money manager, who asked not to be identified, put the odds for a recession at closer to 9 to 1, and said the only question is whether the economy would fall by 1% or by 3% to 4% next year, or "whether it's a 'little r' or a 'Big R.'" 
This executive said he doubted government's ability to manage its way around global deflation. 

   Erich Heinemann of Moseley Securities, an economist who has been forecasting a recession, foresees "a very modest" 2% downturn next year, "occasioned by our inability to finance our international borrowings at a level we can afford." 
He says it remains to be seen how much easier money will help.
