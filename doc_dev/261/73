ARE WE at a watershed for the investor? Every few decades the conventional
wisdom about how personal portfolios should be disposed may need to be
re-examined.
The longer that the British economy remains obstinately sluggish, and
inflation continues to subside, the more relevant could be the experience of
savers long ago before the second world war.
During the 1970s and the 1980s, it became the familiar pattern that
sophisticated private investors put most of their money into houses and
company shares (or more frequently, into equity-based institutional
products, such as unit trusts, pension plans or endowment policies).
This investment pattern was primarily a response to inflation, which
averaged 13 per cent a year during the 1970s and remained a serious -
although variable - threat during the 1980s. Almost throughout this period
the pound sterling floated freely - whereas during the 1950s and 1960s it
had been loosely linked to the dollar, and in 1990, of course, it became
tied to the Deutsche Mark.
The UK proved unable to maintain the value of sterling satisfactorily on its
own, and investors came to understand this the hard way. Government
fixed-interest securities (gilt-edged) turned out to be a swindle: if you
invested Pounds 100 in gilts in 1965 in a supposedly safe investment, then,
adjusting for the purchasing power of money, you would have lost nearly 90
per cent of your capital by 1980.
Short-term deposits were not much better. Bank and building society rates
were held down by cartels and restrictions. During the 1970s, building
society depositors suffered negative returns every year, allowing for
inflation. Even adding in interest, the annual real losses varied between 2
and 14 per cent. It was a much better idea to borrow than to save.
Stock market investors also lost in real terms in the 1970s, but not so
badly. Home owners did best at that time, especially if they had big, cheap
mortgages.
Further back in history, however, British investors needed to behave very
differently. In 1925, the UK went on to the gold standard, in effect a kind
of ultra-tough version of the European exchange rate mechanism. Although the
government was forced off the gold standard in 1931 and it devalued by 25
per cent against the US dollar, that was the time of the slump and inflation
remained quiescent.
In fact, the cost of living fell by 2 per cent a year on average between the
mid-1920s and the mid-1930s. Gilt-edged proved to be excellent investments
over this period, and although the running yield gradually fell from 4 1/2
to about 3 per cent, the capital value rose correspondingly. Allowing for
negative inflation, the total real return was about 10 per cent a year.
Incidentally, I am relying for many of these figures on the excellent
long-term Equity-Gilt Study from stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
covering the period 1918-1991.
What about shares? Going on to the gold standard had meant that UK equities
failed to share in the late 1920s boom on Wall Street, but on the other hand
there was no dramatic 1929 crash either. After the initial shock of the 1931
devaluation, which hit gilts but was worse for equities, the stock market
staged a strong revival which lasted up to 1936.
As for houses, this was a period of cheap houses and low-cost mortgages.
People were more inclined to rent than to buy, and from the investment point
of view houses were regarded as income-earning assets rather than as a
source of capital appreciation.
Do the 1920s and 1930s have any lessons for us today? You could draw
parallels between the gold standard and the ERM. So long as we stay hitched
to the Deutsche Mark, fixed-interest bonds may be attractive investments.
But if we are forced out of the ERM, the inflationary consequences could be
more severe than they were from 1931 onwards, because at that time many of
our imports came from countries within the sterling area.
Even within the ERM, negative inflation is scarcely likely. In the UK, since
the war, there has been no year when retail prices have fallen, although in
1959 they were unchanged. But it is worth looking at the six-year period
1958-63. Inflation was only 2 per cent on average during those years, the
kind of pattern we might expect within the ERM and, eventually, European
monetary union.
What happened to investments at that time? Well, gilts yielded 5 or 6 per
cent, and gave modest real returns, while the stock market boomed,
reflecting the strong economy of the 'you've never had it so good' era. But
the strength of share prices may have reflected a once-and-for-all recovery
from the distortions of wartime: from 1960 onwards, share prices stagnated
for several years.
Coming back up to date, we have recently been moving through a transition
period. Essentially, the shares-and-houses boom had petered out by about
1988. Gilt-edged have begun to perform quite well. Even more remarkable has
been the strong performance of building society savings accounts, which have
given excellent returns since interest rates rose four years ago.
The high short-term interest rates must be a transitional phenomenon,
however. Since 1988, short-term rates have been higher than the long-term
rates on gilts. In historical terms, this is an aberration. Savings accounts
may not be an easy way out for investors for a great deal longer.
Today's investors have one extra option: index-linked gilts. These are about
10 years old, and have performed rather badly so far, with their failings
exaggerated by the very high returns available on other assets. But they
could do well if there is a prolonged depression and real interest rates
come down. They also give protection against high inflation, and could
become more popular if sterling is taken out of the ERM.
Whatever happens, it does not look as though the residential property market
will provide good returns in the foreseeable future. Money will be kept
relatively tight, and the tax breaks on mortgage borrowing are not nearly as
attractive as they used to be.
If the new government looks like sticking it out within the ERM, then
fixed-interest gilts could be attractive, although not many British
investors are comfortable about buying them. There is pre-war historical
evidence to suggest that, in tough economic conditions, they can perform as
well as company shares. But if sterling is floated again, investors will be
wise to place their main reliance once again on the stock market.
The way we were
The FT 30-share index was not launched until 1935. However, the Institute of
Actuaries index had been operating for seven years, and was the recognised
yardstick of London equity prices. Here, it shows how the market fell after
the crash of 1929, rose again soon after the UK government had come off the
gold standard in 1931, and continued rise until the late 1930s brought the
fear of war.
