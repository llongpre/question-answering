   The Aug. 10 article on the bull market's inequality was among the worst I've ever seen on the Journal's front page. 
The headline, "Institutions, Brokers, Some of Rich Gained the Most While Millions Lost Jobs," could have led the Daily Worker. 
The story itself was not much better, practically arguing that for America as a whole the bull market has been costly. 
As a former associate editor of the Journal, I could hardly believe my eyes. 
The article will be an invaluable citation to the loony left in America, and to tax increasers, trade protectionists, income redistributionists and manic egalitarians. 

   How quaint it is for the principal journal of Wall Street to discover that when stocks and bonds appreciate, the investors who own them tend to benefit more than those who do not! 
And when the market crashes, it is the big losers who are first to jump from skyscrapers. 
But when the market crashed in 1929-1932, the common people who did not lose a nickel on Wall Street wound up crushed in the Great Depression that followed. 
For the Journal to now be blind to the great prosperity being felt at the grass roots suggests its editors do not understand the stock market. 

   To complain that the economy has only expanded 40% in five years while market value has expanded 200% indicates ignorance of the market as a discounting mechanism. 
The market is telling us the future of profits from the nation's capital stock looks that much better than it did five years ago. 
Either there will be more sustained growth or there will be fewer recessions affecting that income stream, or both. 
The outlook for unemployment, interest rates, inflation and after-tax real percapita income is far greater now than it was in 1982, and these are palpable benefits to the average American. 

   The article also complains that the "big winners in the bull market seem to be pension funds and other institutional investors, and their gains affect ordinary citizens' wealth only indirectly." 
What nonsense. 
Almost all American families have gained direct wealth through the appreciation of their pension assets. 
At the outset of the Reagan administration a great fear among ordinary Americans was the stupendous volume of unfunded pension-fund liabilities, including that of Social Security. 
We hear no more of that; now we hear that pensions are overfunded, with some loonies demanding the slicing up of that pie. 

   The bull market is the direct result of President Reagan's historic tax reforms, which are still unfolding. 
The Journal's editorials have said the reforms make the U.S. the world's largest tax haven. 
The news columns, which continue to promise that poverty is just around the corner, have not made that connection. 
Next, we will hear demands for a special prosecutor to indict the president for pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to unseemly highs.
