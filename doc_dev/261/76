   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an upward
revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession.
   The Commerce Department reported a month ago that the index had
declined 0.2 percent in December after falling in October and
November.
   Three consecutive monthly declines in the index is the
traditional, but not infallible, signal of an impending recession.
   In today's report, however, the December calculation was revised
to show an increase of 0.3 percent.
   Since it was created in 1948, the index has correctly forecast
every recession the country has had with declines for at least
three consecutive months. Thus, the revision to December was taken
by economists as a heartening sign that the country is unlikely to
suffer a downturn this year.
   ``The leading index shows that this is a no-recession year for
the U.S. economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the
Boston Co. ``We will have a slower economy but no recession.''
   Sinai predicted that overall economic growth, as measured by the
gross national product, could dip as low as 0.5 percent in the
current January-March quarter as factories cut back production to
work off a backlog of unsold goods. But he said growth will
gradually strengthen as the year progresses, aided by continued
strong demand for U.S. exports.
   ``The economy will have a reasonably good year for an election
year, especially in view of the mine field of risks that are
around, ranging from the old age of the expansion to the effects of
the stock market crash,'' Sinai said.
   In a second report today, the government said construction
spending dropped a sharp 2.9 percent in January, the biggest
setback in 10 months, as widespread weakness in all categories from
housing to non-residential construction and government building
posted declines.
   The leading index has taken on added significance since Oct. 19,
when stock prices plunged a record 508 points, eclipsing the 1929
market crash, which preceded the Great Depression.
   Since October's steep decline, however, a number of business
barometers have shown strength, including continued declines in the
unemployment rate. Even the stock market has rallied in recent
weeks, climbing more than 48 points on Monday to close at its
highest level since the October collapse.
   Economists are looking for the economy to slow in the first half
of 1988, but they now believe that the sluggish growth will not
worsen into a recession.
   The National Association of Business Economists said Monday that
while more than half of its members responding to a November survey
believed the country would suffer a recession this year, that
figure had now dropped to about one-fourth.
   The 0.6 percent January decline was led by a big increase in new
claims for unemployment benefits, which averaged 351,000 a week in
January, up 12.5 percent from the December level. Since January,
however, the weekly unemployment claims figures have been falling,
further easing recession fears.
   In all, five of the nine available indicators showed weakness
during January. After unemployment claims, the negative factors
were a drop in building permits, a decline in manufacturers' orders
for consumer goods, changes in raw materials prices and a drop in
business delivery times.
   Four indicators showed strength during the month, with a rise in
stock prices making the biggest gain. Other positive forces were
the growth of the money supply, increases in the length of the
average workweek and a rise in orders for plant and equipment.
   The various changes left the index at 190.2 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, until
recently had been expecting a recession in the early part of 1988.
But he said he was now less pessimistic because a variety of
business barometers have rebounded after an initial shock from the
stock market decline.
   ``The economy isn't out of the woods yet, but a recession
forecast is a diminished probability now,'' he said.
   The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
raced ahead at a 4.5 percent rate in the final three months of
1987. But almost all of that increase came from a big buildup of
unsold products.
   Analysts said production will be cut back in the current quarter
while those high inventory levels are worked down. Many economists
think growth will slow to below 1 percent with some even expecting
a negative GNP growth figure from January through March.
   But economists think growth will then slowly improve, allowing
the economy to expand at around 2 percent for all of 1988, about
half of the 1987 level.
   ``Most of the growth in the economy is going to come from
exports with consumer spending and home building continuing to be
depressed,'' said John O. Wilson, chief economist at Bank of
America in San Francisco.
