A historical parallel to the present-day threats to the world economy would
be enlightening to people with imagination.
In 1938-39, the threat of communism to the capitalist democracies had by no
means vanished. Yet in those years the main threat came from Nazi Germany.
The blindness of many western statesmen to this new threat, and their
continued obsession with communism, cost their citizens dearly by delaying
preventive action against the Axis powers.
Inflation is like the communist threat in 1938-39. Only the meretricious
will say that it is yesterday's threat, or that we can forget about it. But
for the time being the greater threat is one of global depression - by which
I do not mean a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but a drawn-out
under-performance of output and employment, politically as well as
economically debilitating.
Let me cite three out of many pieces of evidence. Credit Suisse First Boston
points out in its October Economics Bulletin that the devaluation of
sterling and the lira, relative to the D-Mark and the franc, have not had
their normal postwar effect - higher inflation in the devaluing countries.
Instead UK producer prices have shown only a glancing rise after
devaluation, and Italian prices rose less than expected. On the other hand,
French and German producer prices, especially the former, have actually
fallen.
Credit Suisse First Boston may be jumping the gun in calling the net effect
deflationary. Consumer prices normally rise more than producer prices
because productivity in services does not rise as quickly as in industry.
Yet the price indices may be deceptive. The best statisticians cannot pick
up all the quality improvements or special discounts that lie concealed
behind the price-lists. Nor, as even the Bank of England warns us, should
policymakers treat as inflationary the knock-on effects of indirect tax
increases imposed by governments to relieve their structural budget
deficits.
The second instance comes from the Bank of England's new Inflation Report.
This contains a chart, reproduced here, showing the expected profile of
inflation derived from gilt-edged prices. This does indeed show some
expected rise from a 1995 low-point, but not by much. The important lesson
is that expected inflation in about 10 years fell by one percentage point
between May and August, and by almost as much again in the period to
October. Inflationary expectations are now 'down close to where they had
been before sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism'. Indeed,
assuming that gilt-edged yields contain some risk premium, as well as an
allowance for future inflation, inflationary expectations lie within the
government's 1-4 per cent range.
Third, there are signs that UK retailers' price wars are no flash in the
pan. Midland Global Markets Research has collated a good many pointers to
retail price restraint being with us to stay. The retail sales price index
has risen less than the underlying RPI and sales volume has increased faster
than gross domestic product. Within the retail trade, the sectors that have
held down prices most have seen the fastest sales. The war between BT and
Mercury, together with the price cuts announced by Sainsbury yesterday,
exemplify what is happening.
There is a more cosmopolitan element too. Although the importance of China
in the world economy has been hyped up, UK imports from the emerging markets
 -eastern Europe, Latin America and east Asia together - have risen in a
mere three years from 17 1/2 to 21 per cent of the total. As Credit Suisse
First Boston suggests, such imports have put pressure not only on British
margins, but also on the margins of traditional suppliers in western Europe
and elsewhere.
These direct influences on the price level of western European countries do
not conflict with a monetary interpretation of inflation. What they do mean
is that the effects of demand restraint come through more quickly into the
price level. This is all to the good. Nor should the success of the new
exporters be regarded as a threat. For they do not sell their wares to line
their central banks with D-Mark, franc and sterling notes, but to buy
western produce and know-how.
What, however, threatens to throw a spanner in an otherwise benign set of
consequences is the weakness of demand in the industrial world. The Bank of
England mentions a 6 1/2 per cent growth of Nominal GDP as according with
'the real growth needed in the recovery, and the inflation target'. Yet such
demand expansion is not taking place in the UK or in any other leading
member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As The
Economist pointed out last week, Nominal GDP is growing by 3 per cent or
less in all EC countries except the UK; and even in the latter it is well
below the Bank's benchmark.
We should avoid a futile battle between those who see European depression in
terms of inflexible labour markets and high costs of employing workers, and
those who worry about inadequate demand. The more flexible labour markets
become, the greater the benefits of a moderate but positive rate of demand
expansion. In fact, the climate for pay flexibility and for a critical look
at labour overheads has never been better - after many decades of moving in
the wrong direction. But the one thing that could scupper this new mood and
turn it into resentment would be if lower pay and prices simply led to
slower demand growth in money terms, with little to show in output and jobs.
* * * In this new phase the case for an independently accountable Bank of
England has to be restated. Its sole task can no longer be just to stop
inflation. Nor can the real economy be always safeguarded just by making the
counter-inflationary strategy sufficiently gradual. Growth depressions may
persist for years without causing a deflation that shows up in the
statisticians' indicators.
In current conditions an independent central bank needs to have an objective
for nominal demand. Nominal GDP is the best-known variant but other
measures, such as domestic expenditure, which I need not labour, may be more
operational and suitable for concerted international action.
There is nothing novel about all this. In spite of Alan Greenspan's
attachment to price stability, the US Federal Reserve has always had other
aims. The New Zealand Reserve Bank operates through a contract with the
finance minister, which now covers inflation exclusively, but could be
renegotiated next time to cover some version of Nominal GDP.
The main case for an independently accountable central bank is not that it
can magically bring price stability at a zero cost. It is the case for
having one body clearly responsible for monetary policy, which could not
then be blamed on some amorphous amalgam of politicians, officials and
central bankers as at present.
Moreover, it is a good democratic idea that fewer decisions should be taken
by a central government, constantly looking over its shoulder at its
parliamentary majority, and that more should be taken by other bodies
accountable in other ways.
It is still desirable that a central bank should acquire a first-class
counter-inflationary reputation. For it can then get away with more demand
stimulation when the time is ripe, and there will be fewer suspicions that
it is taking inflationary risks to buy an election. But this need not
prevent it having wider objectives.
To revert to our opening analogy from the 1930s. The statesmen who most
successfully took on the Nazis were far from soft on communism. But they
were aware that there was more than one threat and that different threats
could be uppermost at different times.
