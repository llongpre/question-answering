   The most powerful myth ever created by Hollywood may be that the movie business is recession-proof. 

   Only yesterday, Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA Inc., Universal Studios' parent, was quoted by the New York Times as saying he would rather have a popular movie in "the worst economy" than a flop like "Howard the Duck" in a good one. 

   But the movie industry's supposed sturdiness in bad times needs another look, because a 1988 consumer spending slowdown seems to be in the cards. 
With movie ticket prices rising, bears say, many people might rent videocassettes and buy pizza, instead of paying a small fortune to see a movie and spend a night on the town. 

   In the 1982 recession, VCRs and pay television weren't a factor. 
Movie makers do earn revenue from home video and pay-TV sales, but that won't fully compensate for lost box-office revenue, says Dennis McAlpine, an Oppenheimer analyst. 
Even diversified entertainment giants like MCA "need that incremental profit" from the box office, he says. 

   Premiere, the movie magazine, recently noted that Hollywood hasn't always been recession-proof. 
Indeed, the Great Depression cut weekly movie attendance 25% to 30% from 1929 to 1932. 
That pushed most studios into the red --and Universal, among others, into receivership. 
Moreover, the industry has had boom-bust cycles of its own making: Profit collapsed in the 1969-1971period thanks to the production of too many and too costly movies. 

   Mr. Sheinberg says nobody foresees a severe depression, "with people jumping out of windows." 
In milder slowdowns, he says, "people put entertainment high on the list of things not to be disposed of." 

   If anything, the Oct. 19 crash is helping the movie industry, adds Sumner Redstone, National Amusements' chairman. 
The big theater chain's sales over New Year's weekend, screen for screen, were 40% to 50% higher than last year, he says; October through December, sales were 8% to 10% higher. 

   Several movies are drawing people to theaters, Mr. Redstone says. 
Among others, he cites "Three Men and A Baby," Walt Disney's "mega-hit"; "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and "Raw," the Eddie Murphy movie, from Gulf &amp; Western's Paramount Pictures; and "Broadcast News" and "Wall Street" from News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film. 

   Overall, 1987's U.S. box-office receipts could total $4.2 billion, Variety estimates. 
That would top 1984's record and would be 10% higher than in 1986. 
Moreover, bulls expect 1987's popular movies will provide some studios with steady 1988 revenue from home movie sales. 

   But Oppenheimer's Mr. McAlpine sees clouds ahead. 
With home video now in 50% of U.S. homes and with movie tickets as high as $7 at some New York cinemas, many adults might just stay home, he says. 
While younger people are dedicated moviegoers, he says, the patronage of grown-ups is a "bonus" for the industry. 
Last year's bumper box office owed something to movies like Paramount's "Fatal Attraction," analysts say, which attracted older audiences. 

   Another worry: More movies are competing for every box-office dollar, thanks to prolific independents like Cannon Group and De Laurentiis Entertainment. 
Variety counts 7% more movies opening in the U.S. in 1987 than in 1986; a total of 604 movies started production in 1987, compared with 529 in 1986. 
Some current movies like "Planes" and Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun" were costly to make, adds Mr. McAlpine. 

   Moreover, industry inventories of theatrical and TV movies have been rising in recent years, says David Londoner, a Wertheim Schroder analyst. 
Currently, he estimates, inventories equal 60% of 1987's revenue from filmed products, compared with only about 44% in 1979. 

   Mr. Redstone says the industry hasn't learned to distribute movies "in an orderly way." 
This week, he says, five films including "Moonstruck" will "be dumped on the market," maybe diminishing their chances. 
"I've never bought the theory that motion pictures are contracyclical," he adds. 
Recently, National Amusements bought Viacom, a big cable concern. 

   Of course, the box office today is less important than formerly for diversified giants like Disney and Gulf &amp; Western. 
But Mr. McAlpine says a 10% drop in box office --which he doesn't predict --might cut the majors' per-share profit by at least a similar amount, while Cannon and DeLaurentiis would suffer much more. 
Mr. Londoner is bearish on Columbia Pictures, the Coca-Cola unit that recently merged with Tri-Star Pictures. 
Its inventory-sales ratio of 1 to 1 is unusually high, he recently told clients. 

   Some analysts say MCA is vulnerable. 
Universal's last blockbuster movie was 1982's "E.T.," says Roy Hong, a First Boston analyst. 
Its revenue from TV series might fall 10% in 1988, he adds. 

   Harold Haas, MCA's chief financial officer, says 1988's revenue from series like "Kate and Allie" appears lower than 1987's, but "there are still other contracts to be negotiated." 

   In recent years, movie attendance hasn't visibly responded to economic cycles. 
Annual ticket sales have averaged about one billion, with small swings apparently due to the quality of movies. 
In 1982's recession, "E.T." helped to raise the industry box office 16%, says Mr. Hong. 

   But the next recession might be the test: There has never before been so much competition for the movie dollar, says Oppenheimer's Mr. McAlpine.
