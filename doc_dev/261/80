   Nicholas Ward's letter (Dec. 4) suggests that we praise "Milton Friedman No. 1" for his monetary scholarship and condemn "Milton 2" for peddling outrageous ideas (such as eliminating the minimum wage or getting the government out of public housing). 
I heartily disagree. 

   Prof. Friedman will probably be remembered generations hence for his innovative market solutions as viable alternatives to current statist policies; for example: his voucher system for public education, the negative income tax, and his insights into the damaging effects of licensure -- all lucidly discussed over 20 years ago in his "Capitalism and Freedom."

   Mr. Ward misunderstands the relationship between normative policy recommendations and positive economic analysis. 
He seems to imply that the two are unrelated, that Milton 1 and Milton 2 somehow never communicate with one another. 
In fact, however, policy recommendations must be firmly grounded in positive analysis. 
What would you recommend about macroeconomic policy if your "brilliant" theories showed that consumption spending by households, the single largest component of aggregate demand, was much more stable than was previously believed ("A Theory of the Consumption Function"), or that the Fed was to blame for turning the 1929-33 business cycle downturn into the Great Depression ("A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960")? 

   And while Milton Friedman usually does argue that the market can allocate scarce resources better than government, there are exceptions. 
For example, he has questioned whether a free market in organs for transplants would be a good idea because it might increase the incentive to commit murder. 
I have never met Mr. Friedman, but his ideas (and those of many of his students) have had a greater influence on me than those of any other living economist. 
While it may be effective rhetoric to characterize normative policy recommendations as dope peddling, Mr. Ward unfortunately offers no criteria for choosing from whom we should buy.
