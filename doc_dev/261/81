<LEADPARA>  BARELY TWO decades ago, Americans looked upon combat-age youths as moralizers
bursting with inner wisdom to teach the world. But no one could mistake the
youngsters of 1969 with those of 1991.;    On campus, older activists don't
expect today's students to express any new-found truths, but rather to
reaffirm well-worn slogans.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      In Saudi Arabia, we heard troops taking pride in their role as blunt
instruments of battle, showing a hardness the nation admired on the
battlefield but criticized elsewhere. America's twentysomethings have become,
according to the news weeklies, "the new lost generation.";     Are we
witnessing a metamorphosis in the American lifestyle? How does one explain
such a dramatic transformation in a single age group?;    What is happening is
something much different: the aging in place of separate generations. By a
generation, we mean a special cohort-group possessing a distinctive sense of
self, born over a span of about 17 to 25 years. Think of these generations as
people moving through time, along what we call the "generational diagonal.";  
 As each of us is born, comes of age, reaches the prime of life and grows old,
we carry though our lifecycle a unique historic signature, an "age location"
against the events and trends of our time. And what is true for each of us as
individuals is no less true of generations as a whole.;    Thus, the bulk of
today's Desert Storm soldiers -- born near the "year of Woodstock" -- grew up
in a time when school and family were under assault, when adults grew
disinclined to sacrifice for the sake of children. These kids became
sharp-eyed survivalists at a very young age, and remain so still. Meanwhile,
the coming-of-age zealots of the late '60s have aged into today's fortyish
enforcers of "political correctness." Moralizers then, moralizers still. And
so on.;    The generational diagonal can provide insight where static age
groups offer no answers at all. It can help explain why Americans worried
about conformity during the 1950s, why inner cities exploded in the 1960s, why
SAT scores fell through the 1970s and or why old-age entitlements were
untouchable during the 1980s. It can also give new answers to historical
questions, such as why the American Revolution happened when it did or why the
Gilded Age followed the Civil War. Viewing the story of America as a sequence
of generational lifecycles gives us a new pattern for understanding our
history -- and anticipating our future.;    When you look upon social history
as a succession of generations, you see how each generation is shaped by its
age-determined role in historic events.;    Intuitively, everyone recognizes
the importance of this "age location." Consider the Great Depression and World
War II. For children at that time (the "silent" generation of Michael Dukakis
and Sandra Day O'Connor), this era meant a smothering parental grip; for
rising adults (the GI generation of Presidents Kennedy through Bush), teamwork
and achievement; for midlifers (the "lost" generation of Truman, Eisenhower
and Hemingway), a slowing down to a new sense of prudence; and for elders (the
"missionary" generation of FDR and Douglas MacArthur), an opportunity to
champion long-held visions.;    This era defined the later life trajectory of
each of these generations over the next two decades. It planted in the silent
generation the seeds of their lonely-crowd conformism, energized the can-do
"new generation" of GI builders and achievers and cast the lost generation in
a poor and politically invisible old age.;    But the pattern is not the same
for every event. Compare the Depression of the 1930s with the "Consciousness
Revolution" of the late '60s and '70s. The latter case saw children (whom we
call the "13th generation") grow up quickly and on their own; rising adult
"boomers" fragment and turn inward; silent midlifers speed up through
"passages" to a new sense of personal adventure; and GI elders defend
institutions under siege from the young.;    Generations and history;  Just as
history produces generations, so do generations produce history. At the heart
of this interaction lies a recurring pattern of "secular crises" (threats to
national survival and a reordering of public life) and "spiritual awakenings"
(social and religious upheavals and a reordering of private life).;    Notice
the timing of the four great periods of crisis in American history. There were
the colonial wars and rebellions culminating in the Glorious Revolution of
1689, the American Revolution, the Civil War and the twin emergencies of the
Great Depression and World War II. Each is 80 or 90 years distant from the
next -- the span of, roughly, four generations.;    Notice also how America's
five great spiritual awakenings occurred almost 40 or 50 years distant from
these events: the Puritans' "City on a Hill" in the 1630s; the "Great
Awakening" around 1740; what historians call the "Second Great Awakening" of
the early 1800s; the Bible Belt revival and radical populism of the 1890s; and
the recent Consciousness Revolution. These events fall into a pattern because
of the interaction between a generation's type and its "age location" among
the happenings of the era.;    Each of America's 18 generations, of course,
has had a unique relationship with the story of America. (See related story on
this page.) But when we strip away such linear trends as rising living
standards and improving technology, we see similar human dramas that repeat
again and again. When we link age location with American lifecycles, we find a
recurring cycle of four generational personalities -- each cycle lasting about
80 or 90 years:;    First, an Idealist generation grows up as indulged youths
after a crisis. It comes of age propelling a spiritual awakening, fragments
into narcissistic rising adults, cultivates principle as midlife moralizers
and emerges as visionary elders who guide the next crisis. Examples: John
Winthrop's Puritan Generation, the fiery founders and stern patriarchs of
America's original New Jerusalem; Benjamin Franklin's Awakeners, who from
their twenties to their sixties, took American from the Great Awakening to the
American Revolution; Abraham Lincoln's Transcendentals, the most spiritually
self-absorbed generation in our history, whose vision of a purifying
apocalypse steered the nation toward the Civil War.;    Next, a Reactive
generation grows up underprotected and criticized during a spiritual
awakening. It comes of age as alienated risk-takers, mellows into the tough
midlife managers of crisis and ages into caustic but undemanding elders.
Examples: George Washington's Liberty Generation -- wild soldiers in youth,
gritty war-leaders in midlife, cautionaries in old age; Ulysses Grant's Gilded
Generation of metal and muscle who in midlife repudiated their prophetic
next-elders by celebrating Pragmatism; and Harry Truman's Lost Generation, the
turn-of-the-century "bad kid" generation whose early-life appetites
electrified the 1920s and whose late-life exhaustion calmed the 1950s.;   
Next, a Civic generation grows up under new adult protection after an
awakening. It comes of age by overcoming a new secular crisis, unites as a
heroic and achieving cadre of rising adults, builds institutions as powerful
midlifers, and later -- during the next awakening -- finds itself attacked as
worldly elders. Examples: Cotton Mather's Glorious Generation, the colonial
war heroes who became advocates of social discipline and material progress;
Thomas Jefferson's Republican Generation, nation-builders early in life, whose
major disappointment late in life was the ungovernable passions of their
children; and today's "Baby on Board" Millennials.;    Finally, an Adaptive
generation grows up as suffocated children of crisis. This generation comes of
age as adult-emulating conformists, produces the indecisive mediators of the
next awakening, and ages into sensitive and other-directed elders. Examples:
William Byrd II's Enlighteners, America's first "silent" generation, with no
member whose name most of today's Americans could recognize; Henry Clay's
Compromisers, the sober youngsters who watched their parents create a nation
and the ambivalent elders who watched their children nearly destroy it; and
Woodrow Wilson's Progressives, the shell-shocked youths of the Civil War and
the sensitive, process-fixated leaders of circa-1910 America.;    Our future's
history;  The generational cycle does not guarantee any particular outcome for
any generation or for society as a whole. Yet it does offer powerful insights
into how the national mood will evolve in the decades ahead. In particular, it
helps us foresee shifts in the personalities of today's living generations as
its members grow older.;    Let's locate ourselves on the cycle.;    As the
Consciousness Revolution recedes deeper into the national memory, we feel a
post-awakening mood reminiscent of the years prior to World War I -- when the
radical turbulence of the 1890s had given way to complex procedural reforms.; 
  Then as now, individualism was flourishing, confidence in institutions was
declining and secular problems were deferred. Then as now, a sixtyish cadre of
post-heroic leaders were designing a legalistic world order, even as new
armies massed and old hatreds festered. Then as now, feminism was gaining
political power, moralistic attacks were growing against crime and substance
abuse and family life was seen as precious but threatened. Antecedents can be
found for this kind of national mood (and generational constellation) in the
1840s, 1750s and 1650s.;    History records what happened over the two or
three decades following these post-awakening constellations. Each time, the
sense of drift and pessimism intensified. Then a crisis emerged, compelling
all generations to unite in the face of perceived public peril. Each time --
guided by the values of elder Idealists, managed by the pragmatism of midlife
Reactives and mobilized by the energy of coming-of-age Civics -- America
passed through a major gate of history, usually in triumph.;    The aging of
the current generational constellation has a clear message for the nation as a
whole. Around the year 2020 -- roughly 80 years after D-Day and the first
Boomer birth year -- we are scheduled to reach the next great hinge of
history. The Crisis of 2020 could be a moment that could rival the gravest
trials our ancestors have known. The risk of major war will be very high. The
crisis may be about weapons proliferation, or environmental peril or a
collapse in the world economy. Whatever the problems, Americans will be
inclined to attack rather than defer them, led by old Boomer priest-warriors
who will care far more about inner principle than material sacrifice. The
result could be triumph or tragedy beyond anything imaginable today. (box)  </TEXT>
