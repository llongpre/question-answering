University of Tsukuba: "The First Great Recession"] 
  [Text] Part 1. Terrifying Resemblance Between Early 
Showa and Early Heisei 
  In retrospect, the Fifth Year of Heisei [1993] paralleled 
the 
5th Year of Showa [1930], the year of the "Showa Depression", in 
so many ways. The year 1993 coincides strikingly with the year 
1930: The aggravation of a deflationary recession under the 
sluggish world economy, a belt-tightening economic policy which 
has enhanced such deterioration, a worsening domestic 
agricultural situation, increasing criticism of the government's 
handling of international negotiations, and so on. 
  Furthermore, the economy in the first five years of the 
Showa 
period [1926-1989] was in a period of deflation in which the 
price level dropped approximately 50 percent. In comparison, 
Japan was hit by "asset deflation" in which stock and land 
prices dropped by about half in the first five years of the 
Heisei period [1989]. 
  The difference between the Heisei and the Showa is that 
stocking of the economy has progressed in the Heisei period as 
the accumulation of assets has proceeded. It is not difficult 
to imagine, therefore, that the current sharp decline in asset 
values has had an extremely serious effect on the overall 
economy. 
<H3>  Mistakes by Policymaking Bodies has Lead the Economy Into a 
Bottomless Pit </H3>
  As the deflationary recession of the Showa period came from 
outside Japan, so did the beginning of the Heisei's asset 
deflation. Its origin can be traced back to Black Monday in 1987 
in the United States, and more recently, to the collapse of 
Eastern Europe in 1989 (the first year of Heisei). In 
particular, worldwide monetary tightening was caused by a major 
change in the flow of world funds because the former West 
Germany had to financially support the collapsed former East 
Germany. 
  As a result, the stock and real estate markets of Western 
nations, which are sensitive to interest rates, were hit 
directly and almost without exception, and stock and land prices 
dropped steeply. It was only a matter of time before the 
effects were felt in Japan. 
  Along with such external factors, there was the domestic 
"policy slump" factor behind recession in Japan. That is, when 
asset deflation had become serious due to the collapse of stock 
and land prices in Europe and the United States in the beginning 
of the 1990's, Japan, without considering the international 
situation, exercised excessive monetary restraint out of fear of 
domestic inflation. 
  In fact, this "misgovernment factor" is another echo of the 
Showa Depression. At that time the government adopted an 
austerity policy to deal with the anticipated impact in Japan of 
the Great Depression. In particular, the lifting of the gold 
embargo at the old parity rate is well known to have aggravated 
domestic deflation. 
  Unfortunately, present-day policymakers lacked a global 
point 
of view and carried out over-regulated loan restriction and a 
strengthening of the tax system to "break the bubble economy" 
domestically. As a result, asset markets, including the land 
market, became inactive. Above all, the impact of quantitative 
regulation of loans for real estate, and the strengthening of 
taxes on real estate through the administrative guidance of the 
Bank of Japan [BOJ] and the Ministry of Finance was extremely 
large. This can be said to be the biggest cause of the Japanese 
economy being driven into a bottomless recession. 
  Since then, regulations and taxes for land have not really 
changed, except for a perfunctory relaxation of monetary 
conditions. Partly as a result of that, as you can see in Table 
1, there is as yet no indication of land prices ceasing to fall 
in metropolitan areas, and the rate of decline is growing in 
local areas. Besides, as there is no trade in the market, real 
prices are definitely lower than those shown in the table.

<H5>  `Heisei Depression' Has Begun </H5>
  As we look at the similarities between the Heisei and the 
Showa more and more, it becomes clear the comparison can be 
grasped better if we consider the "Heisei Depression" to have 
already started. In particular, the following are emerging as 
the characteristics of Japanese-type depression caused by asset 
deflation. 
<H5>  (1) Financial Crisis Is Progressing </H5>
  Because asset deflation occurred rapidly, almost all large 
real estate loans became nonperforming loans, and the balance 
sheets of financial institutions were seriously undermined. The 
total amount of bad loans in the widest sense, including loans 
where the market value of the collateral is now less than the 
value of the loan, is said to be 100 trillion yen. In 
particular, most of the weaker small and medium financial 
institutions have virtually failed, and there was even a case of 
a run on a regional bank due to the large withdrawal of 
deposits. Currently, regional shinkin banks [credit unions] and 
credit cooperatives are undergoing reorganization and 
consolidation. In the circumstances, the financial intermediary 
function of the private sector has almost come to a halt, and 
private lending has increased little. 
<H5>  (2) Frequent Occurrence of Business Failures </H5>
  Most corporations, including Japan's leading big businesses, 
lost their latent assets, and are now suffering from the weight 
of liabilities. In particular, "enterprises of good standing" 
that had carried out aggressive, growth-oriented management in 
the past are more likely to be practically bankrupted because 
their liabilities exceed their assets. Instances of listed 
major enterprises going into bankruptcy have begun to appear, 
and it has been predicted that there might well be between 20 
and 30 cases of large-scale bankruptcy. Also, many small and 
medium companies that have been raising funds by offering assets 
such as land as security are now deadlocked in terms of both 
finance and business, and small-scale bankruptcies are rapidly 
increasing. 
<H5>  (3) Era of Mass Dismissals Begins </H5>
  The number of unemployed has already reached 2 million, and 
there are estimated to be a further 3 million who are employed 
but have no real job to do. Companies have begun to cut such 
surplus workers. Although companies have to cut staff costs if 
they are to survive, it is difficult to cut wages and bonuses 
uniformly. As the number of jobs drops, the number of surplus 
staff within companies is increasing. Therefore, there is no 
alternative to cutting surplus workers at the moment. The 
unemployment rate will sharply rise to the Western levels, and 
the ratio of job openings to job seekers will keep on dropping. 
<H5>  (4) Vicious Cycle of Price Destruction Continues </H5>
  As the "price destruction" of assets occurred, with stock 
and 
land prices dropping by half from their peaks, sharp reductions 
in price have now become a matter of course in all sectors. To 
the detriment of below-cost prices, bargain sales are being held 
to recover funds, and this initiates the price destruction 
effect. This will lead to a further cut in costs, bringing 
employment adjustment, wage cuts, and investment restraint. 
Those firms that cannot handle the process will go bankrupt. 
Also, there will be price destruction from the demand side too 
as the buying strength and intentions of individuals and 
companies contracts. The liquidation of assets to cover 
ordinary losses triggers a further decline in stock and land 
prices, and everything contributes to drag deflation down 
further. 
  In addition to the impact of the above discussed process, 
which accelerates in a vicious cycle, the economy seems to be 
driven to a state of depression influenced by confusion in 
politics over "the issue of liberalizing rice imports" and "the 
political reform issue". 
  Therefore, if what is happening from 1993 to 1994 were 
videotaped and played back in the "fast play mode", one would 
see that a depression, which is what happened in the early Showa 
period, is underway at the moment. 
<H5>  Will There Be `Sudden Death'? </H5>
  Why, then, is the "Heisei Depression" emerging at such a 
slow 
pace? 
  The first reason is that corporations and banks which gained 
strength by accumulating assets continue to support their 
"keiretsu" companies and business connections without disclosing 
that the firms have in effect failed. In particular, a problem 
company which has collateral now worth less than its loan, and 
where the relation of rights to that collateral have become 
complicated, cannot be easily closed down, especially if it is a 
large-scale business. In other words, "an attempt to solve the 
issue is deferred by sharing the burden", and it requires time 
to solve the problem. 
  Secondly, there is the underlying support of enormous public 
funds. Over the past two years, expenditure of 30 trillion yen 
in projects has been made, and this public finance has been 
distributed mainly in housing and among small and medium 
business. In particular, lending through the Housing Loan 
Corporation generates housing demand among the primary 
acquisition class, which was affected little by asset deflation, 
and works to keep the bottomless fall of the economy from coming 
to light. 
  However, it is doubtful that this support will last much 
longer. Even powerful corporations and banks are losing their 
own latent assets due to the influence of the deflationary 
recession, and it has, therefore, become difficult for them to 
support companies in trouble any longer. Also, there is a 
growing resistance to the further expansion of public support 
measures because the steep decline in tax revenue is directly 
hitting the government. 
  Furthermore, demand for housing cannot be expected to 
increase any further if the influence of unemployment and 
bankruptcies is going to reach white-collar workers as the 
recession worsens. 
  If existing support is cut and the underpinnings of the 
economy are lost, problems will rise to the surface at once. In 
that case, there would be a danger of "sudden death" depression 
in Japan, accompanied, typically, by panic. 
  How can we tell, then, if "sudden death" will come, or the 
"state of coma" will continue with the economy remaining 
sluggish, or if there is going to be a sign of recovery in the 
future? 
  The answer cannot be found, as before, by using the real 
growth rate as the economic indicator, and interest rates and 
spending as the policymaking indicators. Rather, nominal growth 
rate, price trends, and trends in land and stock prices are more 
important. In other words, one must pay attention to the 
nominal rate of deflation, not the real rate. 
  The reason is that if general prices and stock and land 
prices keep declining in nominal terms, the weight of 
liabilities will become unbearable sooner or later, but if such 
prices start to rise, then the burden of liabilities becomes 
lighter. 
  As the rate of deflation increases, the burden of real 
interest rates becomes heavier, and vice versa. In other words, 
whether the deflation becomes worse, stops, or turns in the 
direction of inflation is the biggest factor in predicting 
whether the future economy suffers a "sudden death" depression, 
becomes "a vegetable", or shows signs of recovery. 
  The reason the traditional economic forecast model was not 
able to predict the current deep recession is because it only 
focused on analysis income or profit and loss, and ignored 
changes in assets or balance sheets. The model also looked only 
at real growth rate as the key economic indicator, and it saw 
prices only as a measure of inflation. 
<H5>  The Lessons To Be Learned From Our History and From Abroad </H5>
  In the Sixth Year of Showa (1931), the second year of the 
Showa Depression, the recession became more serious both at home 
and abroad. Unemployment increased rapidly in the cities, and 
rural communities became more impoverished. Social unrest and 
discontent were on the rise. In September of the same year, the 
Manchurian Incident broke out. The world was plunged into an 
uproar, and social confusion reached new heights. Meanwhile, 
criticism of the Minseito [Constitutional Democratic Party] 
cabinet, which persisted with its policy of austerity and 
lifting the gold embargo, became so strong that it ultimately 
led to the mass resignation of the cabinet in December. Its 
successor cabinet, led by Tsuyoshi Inukai of Seiyukai [Friends 
of the Constitutional Government Party], immediately announced 
the end of the gold standard system, began a positive financial 
policy, and avoided economic catastrophe through special loans 
from the BOJ. 
  Will the Sixth Year of Heisei (1994) follow the pattern of 
the Sixth Year of Showa, which became a historical turning 
point? Will the "Heisei Depression" last another year? Does 
the government have to be changed to achieve a change in policy? 
On monetary policy, will special lending be delayed until the 
change in BOJ governor planned for December 1994? 
  At any rate, the policies needed to stop further deflation 
and avoid the "sudden death" depression have become clear, and a 
consensus has already formed in the market. They include the 
following "three measures" which highlight the liquidation of 
land. Most of the measures are already recognized by the market. 
<H5>  1. Income Tax Cuts Totaling More Than 10 Trillion Yen </H5>
  The implementation of large-scale income tax reduction, not 
as tax reform accompanied by a tax increase but as an economic 
stimulus measure financed by the issue of deficit-covering 
bonds. Tax cuts of 5 to 6 trillion yen have already been 
discounted, and cuts of more than 10 trillion yen is expected. 
<H5>  2. Sharp Reduction in Official Discount Rate </H5>
  Since prices are declining due to deflation, nominal 
interest 
rates must be lowered as close as possible to zero. What is 
needed, to begin with, is a sharp cut in the official discount 
rate to less than 1 percent, and measures to aggressively 
increase the money supply. 
<H5>  3. Liquidating Land and Measures for Bad Loans </H5>
  The write-off of bad loans by financial institutions should 
be accelerated by encouraging transaction in land through the 
use of public funds, along with a relaxation of the controls and 
tax systems related to land. In such a case, it is necessary to 
reorganize small and medium financial institutions which are 
close to failure through the issue of special BOJ loans. 
  In this respect, the way U.S. savings and loan associations 
were consolidated, or the "life boat plan" in which British 
nonbanking financial institutions were reorganized are both 
noteworthy. In particular, the way the U.S. RTC (Resolution 
Trust Corporation) solved the issue of bad loans by seizing and 
liquidating the assets of failed savings and loan associations, 
can be considered a good example of how to solve the problems 
Japan is now facing. 
  If the government is going to adopt such measures to stop 
the 
deflation of assets, depression can be avoided, the decline in 
land prices will stop, and there will be the possibility of 
signs of future recovery. 
  Faced with the first deep recession since the war, the 
common 
sense and experience which have held true only within postwar 
Japan have lost their validity. Whether we can learn from our 
own history and from international experience is the question 
now.
