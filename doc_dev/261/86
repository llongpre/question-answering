<LEADPARA>  Unemployment, after briefly stabilizing, appeared to slide once again.
Business failures were high, and magazine advertising was poor.;   Fall 1991?
Yes, but also the spring of 1933 (as the country was emerging from the Great
Depression), winter 1927 and numerous other periods toward the end of
protracted recessions, when the pain was still fresh and the pleasure
seemingly distant.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     During the past two centuries, the United States has sweated through 44
economic contractions and at the moment is either crawling out of, or is still
mired in, No. 45. The experience is so common it has its own name: the
business cycle.;   In an expansion, output grows, wealth increases,
unemployment declines. The process then stalls and unwinds. Spending,
employment and production fall. Bankruptcies spread, wages fall and misery
often becomes commonplace.;   But the suffering doesn't last. Out of despair
emerges recovery -- or at least it always has in the past.;   The most
protracted decline in U.S. history is now largely forgotten. It was in the
1870s, following the Civil War, when the country was being transformed from
agrarian to industrial, and the nation was in turmoil. A 65-month recession
lasted from 1873 to 1879, followed by a three-year recovery and then a
38-month recession.;   Before World War II, the ups and downs of the economy
were more commonplace. Economic expansions averaged about 30 months, and
contractions were almost as long, according to Columbia University's Center
for Business Cycle Research.;   Since then, the economy has had longer
expansions and shorter contractions. Post-World War II expansions have lasted
on average of 53 months, recessions only 11 months.;   The 1980s boom lasted
92 months, a peacetime record. If the recession ended last spring or early
summer, as suggested by some of the Department of Commerce's most commonly
cited indicators, it will have been another typical postwar contraction of
less than one year and thus continue the trend. If the recession remains in
force, however, it will be the most extended contraction since the
Depression.;   So, with all of this guidance, when are things going to get
better?;   Eleven of the most accurate business-cycle indicators have been
assembled by the government into a "leading" index that has been pointing
toward recovery since January. In the past, the index has preceded an
expansion by one to 10 months.;   The leading index rose steadily for the
first six months of the year but in recent months has been flat. Clearly,
recent economic reports have been so dismal that even the White House is now
using the "R" word to describe current conditions.;   That, however, does not
preclude a recovery. Despite the long history of economic swings, extended
periods of prosperity and impoverishment tend to convince many that current
conditions will last forever.;   "People tend to expect what has already
happened," said Geoffrey Moore, who has studied these movements for more than
50 years and now heads Columbia's business cycle research center.;   If the
past is any reference, current difficulties will contribute to a rebound.
"It's ironic," said Leonard Lempert, head of Statistical Indicators, a
Massachusetts forecasting company, "but the things that are weakening give us
hope. What they are doing is correcting excesses in the economy, and those
corrections lead to a turnaround.";   Since the current recession began in
July 1990, the cost of both labor and capital have fallen. Interest rates and
inflation have declined dramatically, and wages have fallen, albeit more
modestly. Key measures of corporate and consumer debt, often cited along with
government debt as the most vexing problem in the U.S. economy, have both
declined.;   In many prior recessions, all of these factors continued to
decline even after the economy bottomed out.;   Undoubtedly this has been a
difficult Christmas season for retailers, but if recessions are a period for
repairing problems, consumer reluctance is neither surprising nor ultimately
destructive for the economy.;   Spending has risen a little less than income,
according to Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co., a New York investment company. After the
1982 recession, Department of Commerce data suggests that retail sales picked
up after only a slight delay.;   A disturbing aspect of the business cycle is
that even after a recovery begins, some bad news continues. Most important,
the average length of time that job-seekers need to find a job traditionally
continues to grow, often for as much as a year after a recession ends. For
many, lives will not recover until long after the output indicators have done
so.  </TEXT>
