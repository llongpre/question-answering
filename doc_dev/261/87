   His optimism was out of style with much of the
investment community and the economic fraternity throughout his term
in office, but in retrospect his view seems justified by the results.
   The Dow Jones industrial average produced a 16 percent average
compound investment return during his two terms, and the bond
market's 10 percent real rate of total return was the best for any
presidency since Warren Harding's.
   As the president said in his farewell address, ``We weren't just
marking time; we made a difference.''
   A great many of the investment talent in Wall Street and the
economic brains of academe and business didn't really believe him,
though, and you can find it imprinted on their record year after
year during the 1980s.
   While he exuded hope they issued warnings.
   It was a regular ritual: When the annual White House economic
forecast was issued it was instantly discounted as overly
optimistic. Sometimes it was, but maybe it was intentional _ a
challenge to work for, rather than an easy mark.
   Throughout eight years the warnings came from Wall Street about
inflation, recession, monetary collapse, niggardly corporate
earnings, the weaknesses of the manufacturing sector, the budget
deficits. Disaster seemed imminent.
   Maybe President Reagan was lucky to escape the disasters, and
there are grounds for believing that some of the financial
disappointments of his administration might adversely affect the
economy for years to come.
   Still, there was a job to be done when he entered office and it
couldn't wait. The recession of the early 1980s was by some measures
the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Moreover,
confidence was shot.
   The great American manufacturing machine was in its own private
depression, outmatched both domestically and abroad by newer
entrants in the world marketplace. Inflation roared. Interest rates
were high. Faith was a feather.
   It was so bad President Jimmy Carter had referred to the American
people as suffering from a malaise. Optimism wasn't in the picture,
but it was put there. Nothing does it like economic progress, or the
belief that it will come.
   Interest rates began a long decline, from a prime above 18
percent in 1981 to under 8 percent by the mid-1980s. Inflation came
down from the double digits to under 4 percent. Economic activity
surged. Disposable personal income shot from a gain of less than 1
percent in 1982 to 5.9 percent in 1984. Profits ascended from minus
27 percent in 1982 to plus 22 percent in 1983. More than 19 million
jobs were created and filled, 3 million of them in 1988 alone.
   Rusty from disuse, the American manufacturing sector was
resurrected and became competitive again. Almost stagnant, and
sometimes falling during the previous two decades, manufacturing
labor productivity grew at an annual rate of nearly 3.5 percent from
1986 through the third quarter of 1988. More than 400,000 jobs were
created in manufacturing in both 1987 and 1988, and much of the
increased production was sent overseas, helping to lower the trade
deficit.
   You might never have guessed some of these achievements if you
placed credence in the threats, warnings, caveats, criticisms,
advisories and the like that accompanied daily, weekly and monthly
analyses from research departments.
   Maybe it was just a ritualistic rite to distract the demons.
Somebody believed; otherwise, the economy couldn't have done what it
did _ stocks couldn't have risen, for instance _ and Reagan couldn't
have been re-elected.
   The president believed, and it was contagious.
