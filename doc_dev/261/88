THE MOST powerful man in the world this week found that his debt problems
had caught up with him. So what hope is there for the rest of us?
George Bush's State of the Union address and budget statement left the
President doing a passable imitation of our own Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Norman Lamont, hoping that the recovery will come along soon  - by the
spring, with any luck. With the federal deficit projected to swell to
Dollars 400bn (Pounds 220.9bn) his scope for boosting the economy through
tax cuts has been unimpressive, despite a certain amount of advance
publicity which had promised something more exciting.
Lamont himself has had marginally more room for manoeuvre. The UK
government's strong financial position after the budget surpluses of the
late 1980s has allowed public spending to be raised significantly, if
surreptitiously. And last Wednesday's unofficial Green Budget from the
Institute of Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs suggested that the Chancellor
might be able to give Pounds 2bn away through tax cuts in his pre-election
Budget, although this could with equal accuracy be presented as borrowing
Pounds 2bn more. But Lamont will surely have to drop his pretence of aiming
to balance the budget over the whole economic cycle, just as the Americans
have had to admit that there is no foreseeable prospect of balancing the
books in the US either.
The mountain of private sector debt created in the 1980s is now casting a
lengthening shadow. Gloomy pundits are drawing the parallel with the
excesses of the 1920s, which culminated in stock market crashes and a wave
of frauds, and created an overhang of unrepayable debt which led directly to
the slump of the 1930s.
It will not be quite the same this time around, because the monetary
authorities are determined to prevent the collapse of the banking system and
the severe contraction of the money supply that led to the falling prices
and shrinking production of the '30s. This time the Americans, for example,
have bailed out busted financial institutions and the Federal Reserve has
slashed short-term dollar interest rates down to around 4 per cent. But the
conjurors have to come up with their next trick; having rescued the private
sector from the immediate consequences of its misjudgments, they must make
the finance materialise. It is now the public sector debt mountain that we
must fear.
Depressions, according to the debt deflation theory, happen because the
burden of servicing debt becomes crippling. Consumer demand falls back
because people are no longer willing to go on increasing their borrowings,
and may want to reduce them. And developments in the asset markets,
especially property, may be more critical: as values tumble the borrowers,
and then in turn the banks, may become insolvent.
Not every country in the world has followed this well-trodden path to
potential ruin, but the US and the UK have, and so has Japan, where the
inflation of asset prices became notorious during the 1980s. Fortunately,
the Japanese government is still quite comfortably placed financially, but
it has to cope with by far the biggest private sector bubble. Significantly,
the Tokyo market is struggling in 1992, although it brushed aside the 1987
crash which laid Wall Street so low; in contrast, Wall Street is now booming
again, although without very distinct means of support.
So far the various efforts around the world to prop up the banking system
have had reasonable success. True, the monetarists are worried that growth
of the real money supply is still too sluggish to be compatible with
significant economic recovery. Whereas real broad money expanded typically
at the rate of about 5 or 6 per cent a year in the Group of Seven leading
world economies in the prosperous years of the mid-1980s, the rate had
slipped to about zero by 1991. However, this is not remotely as bad as the
minus 10 per cent or so which would go with a full-scale global slump: the
real US money supply fell by something like 40 per cent in the 1930s, as
thousands of banks locked out their depositors.
But how long can governments keep pumping capital into insolvent banks, and
generally maintaining excess spending programmes in order to prevent
economic contraction? If they finance all this through the bond markets they
will drive up long-term interest rates and crowd out the private sector,
including the banks, which will find it hard to attract deposits at the low
interest rates which cautious slump-time borrowers might be willing to pay.
Alternatively, the governments could finance themselves through the banking
system, though it could take an indeterminate period before monetary
expansion became effective in boosting the real economy. You could not
confidently predict the trade-off between real expansion and inflation.
In the end the world economy emerged from the slump of the 1930s because of
the war, which not only directly boosted output but led to the massive
destruction of accumulated capital in Europe and Japan. For a generation
afterwards that left the largely undamaged US as the global powerhouse where
returns on capital were high and economic growth seemed the most natural
thing in the world. Only by the 1970s and, especially, the 1980s did the US
and other major economies need to resort to injections of the drug of debt
in order to maintain the fading momentum.
Now the US is under great pressure from more competitive economies in Asia
and Europe. Some of its core industries are struggling and the level of
profits has tumbled: Wall Street is assuming that this is only a temporary
problem, but such optimism might prove misplaced if we are dealing not with
an ordinary economic cycle but a supercycle.
Only from a lofty historical point of view can we be reasonably sure of the
scale of the problem: a daily newspaper is much too close to the action. In
New York last weekend the G7 finance ministers claimed blandly that economic
prospects were improving.
But when the President of the United States can only make quite feeble
proposals in an election year to dig his economy out of a trough you have to
worry that history has taken effective command.
