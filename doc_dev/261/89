   Sayra Lebenthal remembers the 1929 stock market
crash almost as if it happened yesterday: Her baby nurse had the
day off so she had to put off selling bonds at the family
securities firm to take care of her two small children.
   Mrs. Lebenthal made it into work during last year's crash. Only
this time her son, James, was selling bonds beside her and
daughter, Eleanor, was home after just retiring from the family
business.
   On Monday, two days before the anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987,
crash, Wall Street's grand dame celebrated her 90th birthday with
throngs of visiting clients, co-workers and friends.
   ``I'm not used to all this attention. I'm not used to these
flowers and plants. I'm just a hard-working lady who sells bonds
all day long,'' said Mrs. Lebenthal, who has served as treasurer of
municipal bond broker Lebenthal &amp; Co. for the past 63 years.
   Her son, James, now runs the New York-based firm, but Mrs.
Lebenthal still keeps regular hours at the business that she and
her husband, Louis Lebenthal, started back in 1925 with just a few
dollars. The company has since grown into one of the largest
municipal bond dealers in the country.
   Municipal bonds, which are exempt from federal income taxes, are
debt securities issued by cities, counties or states to finance a
variety of projects.
   ``It took years and years to build up,'' Mrs. Lebenthal said in
a recent interview about her business. ``We started with an idea.
We had no money. We had second-hand furniture in a small office.
The only thing that was new was the secretary.''
   Mrs. Lebenthal learned the business on her own and from her
husband at a time when few women, especially those with young
children, were working on Wall Street. She held the company
together after a succession of strokes felled her husband in 1951,
passing along her knowledge to her two children.
   ``Mother was one smart cookie,'' said James Lebenthal, Lebenthal
&amp; Co.'s chairman.
   ``There were very few women when I started here. (But) I
wouldn't play up the fact that I'm a woman,'' Mrs. Lebenthal said
in a stern voice.
   For Mrs. Lebenthal, a fiesty, well-dressed great-grandmother who
holds a law degree from the University of Syracuse, the day begins
shortly after sunrise.
   She sometimes makes a trip to the beauty parlor, then heads to
her Wall Street offices by 8:30 a.m., where she spends most of her
time on the telephone trying to match bonds with clients. Quitting
time is usually eight or nine hours later.
   ``I really cater to them,'' she said of the hundreds of clients
she has amassed over the years. ``There's a lot of sentiment
attached to the years I spent with my clients.
   ``I take from them man's greatest possession: money. If you make
money, you're doing good.''
   Mrs. Lebenthal does most of her work the old fashioned way _
without computers. Behind her desk and undernearth pictures of
assorted grandchildren and great-grandchildren are about three
dozen binders listing her clients in alphabetical order.
   ``I start with the A's on one day and the Z's the next.
Sometimes I miss the O's or P's,'' she said.
   Mrs. Lebenthal said that neither stock market crash particularly
fazed her, especially having lived through the Great Depression,
about a dozens recessions and New York City's fiscal crisis in the
mid-1970s.
   She said business picked up after both stock crashes as
investors looked to the bond market as a safer haven for their
money. She describes most of her clients as conservative investors
who don't know what to do with their money.
   ``The stock market isn't the be all to end all,'' she said. ``I
wasn't sitting here crying. My market became very strong.''
   Mrs. Lebenthal said her husband had predicted the 1929 stock
market crash and had even made bets with several colleagues.
   ``He had won a lot of bets. Did they make good on them? Not
one.''
