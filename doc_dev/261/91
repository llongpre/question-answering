<LEADPARA>  Shades of 1929.;   The stock market appears to be overvalued. Many major banks
are in trouble. Consumers, coming off a decade of excess, still are reluctant
to spend. Layoffs are spreading to that bastion of stable employment, state
and local governments.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bankruptcies of familiar companies line the financial landscape. Real
estate values in some areas have plunged.;   Yet analysts who monitor the
economy regularly say that the odds are extremely small that another
1930s-style Depression is on the horizon, unless, as one put it, "There is
great stupidity in Washington" and policy-makers make all the wrong moves.;  
A far more likely possibility is that the economy, after lifting itself
slightly from a shallow recession, will lose its energy and sink back. The
odds of this are cited at 1 in 4 by many analysts, chiefly on grounds that the
recovery is so slow.;   Fears of a repeat of the '30s spring chiefly from the
anxiety caused by a recovery so lacking in vitality that it hardly looks like
a recovery. Indeed, new job cuts by state and local governments have given the
impression that the recession has returned.;   "State and local governments
operate on their own cycle," said David Wyss, economist for DRI/McGraw Hill
Inc. of Lexington, Mass. "They've got to get their budget in balance. We lost
101,000 jobs in July and August in state and local governments. I expect the
next big round of layoffs in January, with another 100,000 jobs lost.";   Yet,
for all this, economists assure the country that a recovery has begun because
the statistics tell them so. It shows up in indicators that reveal sales
rising in relation to inventories, in increasing exports, in improved
single-family home sales.;   "The chances of a double-dip recession are quite
slim," said Debashis Guha, economist for Columbia University's Center for
International Business Cycle Research. "Growth will be at a modest rate.
Inflation remains low. Interest rates will come down even more. We don't see
much of a downside risk.";   Still, said Robert Dederick, economist at
Chicago's Northern Trust Co., it doesn't feel like a recovery, despite
everything the statistics tell him. Consumer confidence appears to be ebbing
and employment gains have been limited, he said. People are skittish about
spending on big-ticket items because of job-loss fears.;   "There is a risk
that the recovery is going to fall between the cracks," he said.;   In the
1930s, however, hard times arose because of several policy errors, including
overly restrictive monetary policy and protectionist trade legislation. Also,
none of the "safety nets," including unemployment insurance, welfare, Social
Security and deposit insurance, existed.;   Yet the retrenchment by state and
local governments is having a depressing effect on the economy. They are not
only cutting jobs, they also are raising taxes and cutting services just as
the economy is getting its act together, said Jason Bram, economist for the
Conference Board, a business-oriented research group.;   Another worrisome
factor is that exports, after boosting the economy for most of the year, are
showing signs of softening, chiefly because other major industrial economies
are slowing and won't buy as much from the United States.;   Wyss expects the
stock market to decline about 10 percent, perhaps this month. Once the market
realizes that corporate earnings are going to be disappointing in 1992, the
market will head south but not crash, he said.;   The general feeling is that
unless the consumer goes completely on strike or sharply reduces spending, the
recovery will continue to creep along with its own strain of chronic fatigue
syndrome.;   Bram put his finger on a key danger: The recovery may be so
anemic that it keeps the consumer anxious and depressed about the future.
Pervasive anxiety could lead to another downturn, perhaps a severe one.;  
Dederick said the Federal Reserve Board, which has been easing interest rates
to spur the economy, should lead the way out of this sluggishness, lest it
feed upon itself. "I'm counting on the Fed," he said.  </TEXT>
