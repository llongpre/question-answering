   The Soviet foreign minister called Monday for an
international ``New Deal'' to avert an impending economic disaster
fueled by militarization, Third World debt, poverty and
environmental problems.
   ``Right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep
economic depression,'' Eduard Shevardnadze said in a speech in
Manhattan sponsored by the Foreign Policy Association.
   ``The debt of the Third World countries, the interest they have
to pay and the pace of their economic development _ are these not
the signs of an impending catastrophe?''
   He added: ``We could one day begin competing not for political
supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to water, fresh
air and even a green lawn.''
   Shevardnadze told the audience of about 350 people that the
abolition of nuclear weapons, forgiveness of some Third World debts
and increased protection for the environment will be essential for
peace and worldwide stability in the next century.
   ``Radical bold steps are needed, a kind of `New Deal,' a
transition to a policy that would draw developing countries into
the scientific, technological and information revolution,'' he said.
   In the 1930s during the Great Depression, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt promised Americans a ``New Deal'' of government-sponsored
social welfare programs.
   Shevardnadze compared pessimism over the future of perestroika,
the economic liberalization of the Soviet Union, to pessimism over
the future of capitalism during the 1930s in the United States.
   He noted that in 1931, 100,000 Americans requested permission to
emigrate to the Soviet Union.
   ``There were bread lines in New York's Times Square and tents of
the jobless huddled along Riverside Drive,'' he said, adding: ``It
is well known that in those years there were widespread
expectations in left-wing circles that the severe crisis of the
world capitalist system would finally bring about the world
revolution.''
   He said the Soviet Union's ``economic system is undergoing an
adjustment. ... Something similar happened in the Unites States 60
years ago.''
   But he predicted that ``so long as there is the will, the
understanding of the situation and the determination to change
things for the better _ and we certainly have them _ the economy
can remedy its ills.''
