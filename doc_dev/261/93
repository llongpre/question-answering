Sir, Your thoughtful leader, 'The wages of inequality', did not go deep
enough.
The welfare system we have today was essentially the creation of the
distinguished economist Sir William Beveridge, later Lord Tuggal. His
report, signed by him alone, was published as a white paper in 1942. Its
main feature was a scheme of social insurance against 'interruption and
destruction of earning power and for special expenditure arising at birth,
marriage or death'.
Beveridge reflected the national mood of the time. The country was united by
war and determined to avoid a repetition of the enormous social damage done
by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The structure he conceived has
achieved its original purpose handsomely. It is a tribute to the underlying
thinking that it has lasted more than 50 years. But it is now out of date.
The mood and the environment of the 1990s are totally different. We have
four decades of boom/bust cycles behind us and yet another developing round
us. General levels of affluence and the expectations of beneficiaries are
two or three orders higher. We are learning the hard way the political and
economic limits to what modern society can and will support by way of
benefits; and at the same time that a significant degree of unemployment may
be endemic. The proportion of society which is past earning age and
therefore past contributing to the system has markedly increased. The
fundamentals and the objectives of social insurance require a complete
rethink.
We need another Beveridge, to design a system for the 21st century. Nothing
short of this will get us anywhere.
