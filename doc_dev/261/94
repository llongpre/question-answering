   February surges in personal income and consumer spending are
being cited by analysts as further evidence that the economy has
suffered no long-term effects from the October stock market crash.
   But the new government reports failed to cheer Wall Streeters on
Thursday, as stock prices took a nosedive that sent the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials down 43.77 points to 2,023.87.
   Separately, the government reported the savings and loan
industry lost $6.8 billion last year, its worst loss since the
Great Depression.
   In its latest eonomic report, the Commerce Department said
personal income of Americans rose 0.9 percent in February,
reflecting strong employment gains in the past few months. Spending
rose 0.7 percent, up sharply from a tiny 0.1 percent January
increase.
   Five months ago after the market crash, some analysts feared
consumer worries about the future would cause spending cutbacks
that could push the country into a recession.
   ``For people who were worried about a major consumer
retrenchment, these numbers are encouraging,'' said Sandra Shaber,
an economist with the Futures Group. ``As long as income gains hold
up, people will continue to spend.''
   Analysts said the February gain in incomes, which followed a 0.3
percent January rise and was the best showing since a 1.9 percent
October increase, reflected good employment news. The jobless rate
fell to an 8{-year low of 5.7 percent during the month.
   In its report on thrift earnings, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board said the $6.8 billion loss for the year included a $3.2
billion loss in the last three months of 1987.
   The year's loss was nearly 50 percent greater than the previous
post-Depression high of a $4.6 billion loss in 1981. The nation's
federally insured S&amp;Ls had a modest $132 million profit for all of
1986.
   Earlier this month, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the
nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $3.7 billion in
1987.
   In other economic reports Thursday:
   _Business startups declined nationwide in 1987 for the first
time since the end of the last recession, but the level remains
strong and reflects economic stability, Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
said. The 7.7 percent overall decline, from 253,092 startups in
1986 to 233,710 last year, affected all industry sectors and all
regions, especially the South and Southwest.
   _The Treasury sold $6.5 billion in four-year notes at an average
yield of 7.90 percent, down from 8.33 percent at the last such
auction in December and the lowest level since four-year notes
averaged 7.89 percent last June 24.
