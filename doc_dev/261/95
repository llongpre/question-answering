TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: REAGAN 'BOOM' JUST A LOT OF NOISE 
</P>

<P>
The propaganda machines continue to roll out their celebrations of the 
robustness and vitality of the U.S. economy. Here is another in my efforts to 
provide at least a partial corrective. I focus this time on a recent effusion 
on the New York Times Op-Ed page, a piece titled "The Reagan Boom -- Greatest 
Ever" by Martin Anderson, former domestic adviser to the one-time actor and 
former President. 
</P>
<P>
With all his hyperbole, Anderson sounds more like a circus barker than an 
economic analyst. He characterizes the "Great Expansion of the 1980s" or 
"Reagan's Great Expansion" as "the greatest, consistent burst of economic 
activity ever seen in the U.S. In fact, it was the greatest economic expansion 
the world has ever seen -- in any country, at any time. . . . If we look at the 
sheer size and immensity of it, at its scope and power, then it cannot be 
denied that this expansion was the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
Among several indicators of greatness, Anderson concentrates on two main 
achievements of the long economic expansion beginning in late 1982: the 
cumulative growth in employment and output that continued for seven years, 
until late 1989. His claims about these particular successes -- to put it a 
little bluntly -- are downright silly. 
</P>
<P>
On the employment front, Anderson advertises the cumulative creation of 18.7 
million new jobs as "a world record: Never before had so many jobs been created 
during a comparable time period." But looking at the absolute scale of new 
employment makes little sense as a measure of an economy's robustness since the 
volume of job generation depends substantially upon the scale of the economy. 
If a 1% annual increase in employment in China resulted in as many as 5 million 
new jobs, would we argue that its economy was growing more robustly than the 
U.S. economy in which a 2.6% annual increase in 1986-87 generated "only" 2.8 
million new jobs? Claims of greatness should focus, in other words, on growth 
relative to the previous size of the economy, not the absolute volume of the 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
And here Anderson's claims dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
Civilian employment, the aggregate upon which Anderson appears to be basing his 
assertions, grew by 18.9% in the seven years of expansion. By comparison, it 
grew by 19.7% in the seven years from late 1970 to late 1977. (Have you ever 
heard anyone refer to the "Great Nixon-Ford-Carter Expansion?") And it grew by 
21.1% in only four years from 1933 to 1937. Do we really want to herald the 
health of the U.S. economy in the middle of the Great Depression? 
</P>
<P>
Or, since Anderson claims a world record, we might look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Civilian employment grew in the seven years from 1950 to 1957 by 20% in Japan 
and by 19.1% in Germany. Shouldn't Germany and Japan be allowed at least a 
share of the title? Or check out this example: Employment in Germany grew by 
46.7% in the five years from 1932 to 1937, 2 1/2 times more rapidly than during 
Anderson's seven magical years. Wasn't economic life fabulous as the Nazis 
prepared for global conquest? 
</P>
<P>
The same kinds of problems apply to Anderson's advertisements about the 
cumulative growth of aggregate output. He cumulates the annual levels of gross 
national product, or GNP, for the seven years from 1983 through 1989, totaling 
"some $30 trillion worth of goods and services." 
</P>
<P>
In this case he not only ignores the problem of relative (versus absolute) 
growth, but he also doesn't even correct for inflation, using figures for 
nominal rather than real GNP. Once we correct for inflation and the scale of 
the economy, average real GNP during Anderson's effervescent expansion was 18% 
higher than it had been in 1982. By contrast, average real GNP during the seven 
years from 1963 through 1969 was 21% higher than it had been in 1962. To which 
interval of seven years would you provisionally accord the "world record?" 
</P>
<P>
How might we more sensibly assess U.S. economic performance during the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
A first guideline can help us avoid pitfalls such as overrating employment 
expansion during the mid-1930s. We should look at the economic record for an 
entire business cycle, not merely its expansion, since part of the health of 
the recent expansion merely reflected a rebound from the devastating recession 
of 1980-82 (just as the apparently impressive employment expansion from 1933 to 
1937 pales considerably alongside the precipitous drop from 1929 to 1932). 
</P>
<P>
By this standard, we should look at the full business cycle from 1979 to 1989 
to assess the impact of conservative economic policies. Let's look first at a 
comparison to our own past, concentrating on two crucial measures: the average 
rate of growth of real GNP and the average pace of investment. 
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1989, real GNP grew at an annual (compound) rate of 2.6%. During 
the long boom from 1948 to 1966, the corresponding growth rate was 3.8%. During 
the cycle from 1966 to 1973, it was 3.1%. During the 1973-79 "stagflationary" 
cycle, it was 2.5%. So, during the much celebrated Reagan cycle, real GNP 
growth was as stagnant as during the previous, much reviled Ford-Carter cycle 
and only two-thirds as rapid as during the long postwar expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The record for the pace of investment was at least as bad. 
</P>
<P>
The average rate of growth of the real net productive capital stock, a measure 
of how much we're expanding our productive stock of plant and equipment over 
time, reached 4.4% a year in the Vietnam-fueled 1966-73 cycle, dropped to 3.5% 
in 1973-79 and dropped again to 2.7% in the Reagan cycle. Should we rank this 
the best business cycle in history if its pace of accumulation averaged only 
60% of the rate achieved during the postwar expansion? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps these comparisons are unfair. Perhaps the global economic climate 
during the 1980s inexorably condemned any individual country to relative 
economic torpor when compared to its own past. We might therefore compare the 
U.S. economy during the 1980s to the six other largest advanced capitalist 
economies: Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada. 
The conservatives promised to revive productivity growth in the United States. 
But if we look at comparative rates of productivity growth from 1979 to 1988, 
the United States ranked seventh among the largest capitalist economies. Dead 
last. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives also promised to rev up investment to fuel our engines of 
growth. But if we look at the economy's relative investment performance, 
comparing the share of gross domestic product going into gross non-residential 
investment, the U.S. economy again limps across the finish line behind all six 
of the others. 
</P>
<P>
In short, judged on either of these two tests, the U.S. economy during the 
1980s flunks decisively. 
</P>
<P>
I don't call this the "greatest economic expansion the world has ever seen." I 
call it a limp and faltering economy in need of immediate rescue from the 
ravages of right-wing economic policies.
