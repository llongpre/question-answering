   Author Saul Bellow once said a novel ``is
balanced between a few true impressions and the multitude of false
ones that make up most of what we call life.''
   Could the same be said about the economy? You judge.
   _We continue to experience the longest peactime economic
expansion in our history, an experience that is often
misinterpreted to mean that these are the best of economic times.
   They may not be. By some measures they might even be among the
worst of times, perhaps the worst in 50 years, and that brings us
back to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
   Speaking recently to a meeting of the Construction Industry
Institute in Seattle, investment advisor John Wright pointed out
that the economy has grown at an average of more than 4 percent a
year since 1982.
   That growth, he observed, has come not from a normal level of
economic activity but from one that was extremely depressed. So far
in the 1980s, the economy has grown at just a 2.5 percent annual
rate in real terms.
   Unless the economy grows more than twice as fast as now appears
likely, he said, ``the decade of the 1980s will be the worst decade
for economic growth since the 1930s.''
   Worse, it follows a decade that wasn't much better. After 30
years of growth averaging more than 4 percent, the U.S. economy has
grown only 2.5 percent a year for nearly 20 years.
   If this is prosperity, he asks, why are average hourly earnings
in the nonfarm sector of the economy no higher than they were a
decade and a half ago?
   _Two other misimpressions of the economy, or aspects of it, tend
to support the observation by Benjamin Franklin that, ``half the
truth is often a great lie.''
   1. It is often believed that until the big crash of October
1987, increasingly affluent Americans were becoming more active
buyers of corporate stocks. It isn't so.
   Federal Reserve figures show that since 1968 households have
been net sellers of stock in all but one year. In that time, the
percentage of household financial assets held as stocks has fallen
to 19.6 percent from 43.4 percent.
   Following the 1987 debacle, the University of Michigan's Survey
Research Center sought reasons why the impact didn't spread, as
forecast. One finding, startling to many people at the time, was
that so few families owned any stock.
   2. An impression exists that housing has been priced beyond the
means of most Americans, a notion that probably results from some
of the so-called affordability indexes.
   It isn't true, and probably couldn't be true for an extended
period of time before supply and demand corrected the disparity. In
defining ``affordability'' these indexes usually relate the median
price of a typical one-family home to the median income of
Americans.
   Median, of course, means that one-half the houses are below the
figure cited and one-half the incomes are above the income cited.
That leaves many thousands of households, each with ability to buy
one of thousands of houses.
   None of these families is required to buy the median-priced
house; smart ones might find equally good houses for much less.
Some seek two-family units. Some prefer to rent rather than buy.
They're not priced out; they choose out.
   The indexes are merely guides. When they rise, it is more
difficult to buy; when they fall it is relatively easier to buy,
assuming other factors remain stable.
   Money Magazine points out still another misimpression about our
economic life. It announces that the common image of Americans
casting aside their aging parents for nursing homes is largely a
myth.
   It claims that only 6 percent of all Americans 65 and older live
in nursing homes, while 70 perecent of the country's dependent
elderly get all their care from family and friends.
   Do not despair if you held such notions. Said Washington Irving
a long time ago: ``The ability to discern between that which is
true and that which is false is one of the last attainments of the
human mind.''
