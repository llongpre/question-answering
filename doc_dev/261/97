   The uneasy mood you describe gripping the American work
force this past holiday season ("Uneasy Mood: As Economy
Falters, Even the Affluent Are Fearful and Cautious," page
one, Dec. 24) would have been well understood by earlier
generations of American workers. For most of the 20th
century, we have identified periodic downturns in the
national economy as recessions, or in the case of the 1930s,
the Great Depression.
   In the 19th century, our great-grandparents called these
periodic disruptions of the economy "panics." Thus it was the
bank panic of 1837, and the general panics of 1873 and 1893,
and it merely meant that the average American worker simply
didn't have much faith that the economic system then in place
worked worth a damn.
