FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Is it time to buy?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE RINGS a bell to tell private investors when it is the right time to
buy shares. There is always the risk of buying just before the market
plunges.
Yesterday's base rate cut caused a mini-rally in equities. Any fall in
interest rates increases the attractions of shares over cash; and declining
rates ease the burdens on indebted companies and increase the chance that
the economy will recover.
But cutting rates has its dangers. The pound may weaken, leading to rising
import prices and higher inflation. And the prospect of a declining pound
may dissuade overseas investors from buying UK shares.
Nevertheless, the traditional valuation methods provide some comfort for
those who believe the time is right to buy. The dividend yield on the FT-A
All-Share is 4.9 per cent, marginally below the 20 year average of 5.1 per
cent but significantly above the rate of inflation at 3.6 per cent. In the
last quarter century, real yields have normally been negative, not positive.
The ratio of long term gilt to equity yields is even better news. The higher
the ratio, the more attractive the returns on gilts - and the greater the
danger that investors will sell shares and buy bonds. Indeed, the ratio
peaked at 3.34 on October 2 1987 - just before the Crash. But the ratio is
currently 1.9, below the 1976-92 average of 2.2.
Prospects are less encouraging if you watch the price-earnings ratio, which
relates share prices to corporate profits. Over the last 20 years, the
average p/e ratio on the FT-A 500 Index has been 11; the current ratio of
15.7 is well above that, indicating that shares are expensive in historical
terms.
But Ian Stephenson, of Smith New Court, feels that if private investors can
afford to lock money away, they should think about moving into the market.
He points out that if gilt yields fall to 8 per cent and the yield ratio
remains around current levels, share yields will fall to 4 per cent,
offering the prospect of a 20 per cent capital gain.
The gloomsters' view is that traditional valuation methods have become
irrelevant owing to fundamental changes in the investment climate. Some
argue that we face a Great Depression akin to the 1930s. Deflation will
occur and that will mean falls in asset prices such as houses and shares.
'We believe the rise from the November 1987 lows represents nothing more
than the biggest suckers' rally in history', says David Kauders, a
Taunton-based financial adviser who has been recommending his clients to
invest in gilts and US treasury bonds. In his newsletter he says: 'It is
essential at present to stand aside from stock markets, to make very few
changes to your portfolios of government securities.'
With expert views diverging so sharply, the average investor can be forgiven
for feeling confused. At least some compromises are available.
The first is the savings schemes offered by unit and investment trusts.
These allow the investor to buy into the market gradually and avoid the
danger of investing just before a crash. Pound-cost averaging means that
investors buy more shares and units when prices are low.
Guaranteed products can protect against capital loss. They are not ideal,
since the investor normally needs to hold them for a set period to receive
the guarantee, does not receive any income and may suffer a tax penalty.
Two five year bonds were launched by the Britannia Building Society and
Guardian Royal Exchange this week. The first offers 110 per cent of the rise
in the FT-SE 100 Index over five years; the GRE offer will pay slightly less
than Footsie's rise. Those interested should consult a financial adviser.
