   America's cartoonists used their pens to skewer disdain and
apathy toward the homeless in a concerted campaign on the comic
pages Tuesday. Nancy and Sluggo played ``homeless couple,'' a
homeless man offered to share his meal of popcorn with Ziggy, and
Marmaduke befriended homeless dogs.
   ``The whole purpose of this is to draw attention to the plight of
the homeless, to make people aware that something needs to be
done,'' said Bill Day, a syndicated Detroit Free Press cartoonist
who was one of more than 100 comic-strip and editorial cartoonists
to participate in the project.
   ``The wealthy can afford lobbying groups. I feel the purpose of
the cartoonist is to help those who can't afford a lobby,'' said
Day, who drew a prosperous, well-fed Uncle Sam gazing in the mirror
and seeing a gaunt-faced version of himself labeled the homeless,
holding his coat together at the neck. There are no official counts
of the number of homeless, but national estimates range from 350,000
to more than 3 million, according to the National Low Income Housing
Coalition, an organizer of the project.
   Some of the artists got their messages across through humor,
others used irony or exaggeration. Some of the cartoons were
political: taking aim at the presidential campaign or Washington
posturing.
   Garry Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' simply focused on the humanity of
a panhandling couple, Alice and Elmont. When a tired Elmont mistakes
his wife for a rival on his corner, he apologizes by explaining he
mistook her for ``some gorgeous hooker,'' and she goes off pleased.
   Other cartoonists relied on the naivete of outsiders, be they
children or observers from a different time like Hagar the Viking.
Dik Browne, Hagar's creator, has his hero and his wife in front of a
fortune teller, who predicts, ``One day, millions of people will be
homeless, and millions of others who could easily help will just
turn away.''
   Responds the fierce Viking: ``And they call ME horrible.''
   In the ``Middletons,'' by Ralph Bunagin and Dana Summers, a child
watches as his mother puts change in a street person's cup. After
she explains the man is homeless and the money is for food, the
youngster says, ``Gosh, he'd get more to eat if I gave him my
trick-or-treat bag.''
   Some of the cartoons had a distinctly political cast, partisan or
not.
   In Cathy Guisewaite's ``Cathy,'' her mom is shown listening to a
campaign speech and getting more and more agitated at the
politician's rhetoric. Finally, when he declares that he'll invest
in a strong defense to keep the country safe for the homeless, she
explodes, telling him to go to bed without dinner and announcing:
``This country doesn't need a president. It needs a mother.''
   The Arizona Republic's Steve Bensen contributed an editorial
cartoon showing a Dukakis figure sitting on a heating grate in
sidewalk in front of the White House with a shopping cart filled
with Dukakis, Jackson and other campaign signs. Above the drawing it
says: ``Cartoonist Homeless Prject. He's a painful reminder of
what's wrong with America _ abandoned, homeless, living on the
streets. Let's keep him that way.'' Below the drawing, it says,
``Vote Bush Nov. 8th.''
   But some cartoonists were able to find a touch of humor, like
Mell Lazarus of ``Momma.'' In that strip, Momma's son raids her
refrigerator because he doesn't have any food at his apartment.
Momma tells him, ``Francis, do you realize there are people in this
country who are totally homeless, while you have two of them?''
   ``If a kid tells his parents, `Hey look. All the comics are about
homeless people today,' we will at least have raised their
consciousness,'' Lazarus said.
