<LEADPARA>  Come September, Dagwood won't be the only one bringing home the Bumstead
family bacon.;   Blondie is getting a job, the biggest thing to happen in the
61-year-old comic strip since Alexander and Cookie, the Bumstead kids, made
their appearance more than 50 years ago.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It is a major turning point," said Dean Young, the cartoonist who dreams
up Bumstead gags in his studio in Clearwater Beach, Fla. "But we're in tough
times, there's a recession going on and Dagwood has spent 60 years trying to
get a raise from Mr. Dithers.";   The Blondie-gets-a-job saga will unfold
throughout September.;   Young is adamant that the nature of Blondie's first
job not be revealed, since it would "spoil the surprise" for Blondie's
millions of readers worldwide. (The strip runs in more than 2,000 papers in 55
countries.);   Suffice it to say that Dagwood's stomach, and that of Daisy,
the Bumstead dog, are indirect beneficiaries.;   Dagwood turns out to be
something of an unreconstructed male chauvinist who must be persuaded to "let"
Blondie work outside the home. He relents in a Sunday column in which Blondie,
a one-time airhead who has grown mildly cerebral over the years, shows him a
cost-benefit analysis.;   Dagwood perks up when Blondie says she should earn
$20,000 the first year.;   The concept of Blondie applying for small-business
loans, taking on a partner (Tootsie Woodley), shopping for power suits and
otherwise plunging into the workaday world has been bouncing around in Young's
head for more than a year, dating to the time of the strip's 60th
anniversary.;   It was then, Young said, that a feminist feature writer
grilled him about the relevance of Blondie's stay-at-home status, wondering
why the strip didn't more fully reflect '90s reality.;   In making the change,
Young did his own research, finding that 67 percent of all American mothers
now work outside the home.;   "Humor is better when it relates to the real,"
Young said. "I just hope the readers like it, and I hope it's funny."  </TEXT>
