<LEADPARA>  POOR Cathy. No nose. No chin. A body shaped like a sack of flour. Eyebrows
that come and go. And those hands -- some days with three fingers, some days
with four.;   No doubt about it. "Cathy" is one of the homelier residents in
the vast and varied venue of Comic Stripdom.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Thank goodness for her one saving grace -- a voice that has spoken to an
entire generation of women. And that's why "Cathy" celebrates its 15th
anniversary today.;   Every day since Nov. 22, 1976, Cathy Guisewite -- the
character's namesake and creator -- has blessed her cartoon panels with
Cathy's observations on life, love and all the attendant misery.;   Surprised
by response;   Guisewite never thought her comic strip about an angst-ridden
career women on a perpetual diet would last more than a week.;   "I couldn't
imagine that I had anything more to write," she says with a laugh. "I was just
drawing out my own personal frustrations. I had no idea the feelings I wrote
about were so shared by other women.";   But they were.;   The real-life Cathy
grew up in Midland, Mich., and once worked for an advertising agency. She drew
cartoons only as a sort of personal therapy -- until her mom coaxed her into
trying it professionally.;   Since finding success, she has tried to separate
herself from her character -- and the daily business of creating her
character. Two years ago, Guisewite and her staff stopped working on the comic
strip at her home in Los Angeles and moved into an office.;   Creator,
character connected;   "I never felt like I worked in my home, I felt like I
lived in my office," Guisewite says. "It was just like my bedroom happened to
be in the same office. My refrigerator had food of everybody who worked for
me. There was no place to go and not be living in my career.";   Besides, she
needed a break.;   "I really have devoted myself to the comic strip a long
time," Guisewite says. "I want my own identity. I need that more than I did in
the beginning. I need to feel like I had my own life. Mind you, there are
certain traits that we certainly share, and we always will.";   Like angst. A
decade and a half of producing a successful comic strip and Guisewite still
worries.;   "Pretty much, I sit down to write the strip, I feel like my career
is over," Guisewite says with a laugh. "I never have an idea.  </TEXT>
