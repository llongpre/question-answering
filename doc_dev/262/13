<TEXT>     When you're a cartoonist whose main character is a rambunctious teen-age
girl, you have plenty of humorous and touching crises to cover. Greg Evans,
creator of the nationally syndicated Luann strip, says he has already explored
many teen issues in his six years with Luann, from the onset of puberty to
greasy hair.;    "But off and on, in the back of my head, I've wondered for a
long time, 'Can I do this one particular idea?' ";    And so, Evans launches
-- for what he says is the first time in daily newspaper history -- a comic
story line about a girl having her first period.;    "Of course I consulted a
lot with my wife, Betty, and she helped me out on some of the issues and
concerns that go along with that monumental moment in a young girl's life,"
says Evans, 43, who lives in San Marcos, near San Diego.;    When he sent the
roughs to his syndicate, North America, they were impressed and very
supportive about pursuing the story line in the strip. Four newspapers refused
to run the sequence and will publish "generic" Luann comic strips instead.;   
In the first strip about menstruation, a stunned Luann says, "AAAAAA!! It's
happened!!" Outside the closed bathroom door, her dad asks if she is OK.;   
"It's happened! I've just . . . I'm . . . It's . . .GO GET MOM!;    Calmly her
father goes to the living room and says to his wife, "Honey! I think there are
now TWO mature adult women in this house, and the newest one needs her
mommie!!";    Evans says he was careful to make Luann's event humorous but
educational.;    Daughter likes story line;  "Many girls have no one who will
even talk to them about this," says Evans, who says his 12-year-old daughter
likes the story line.;    "It would seem horrifying to be in the position of
not knowing what is going on with your body," he adds. "If we can serve just
one girl by letting her know it is a normal thing that happens, then we can
risk some cranky letters from people who won't like this on their comics
page.";    A select sampling of local professionals familiar with teen issues
viewed the strips.;    Los Gatos pediatrician Richard Cirone likes the strips
and even suggests the cartoonist compile a book for mothers who have a tough
time explaining the subject to their daughters.;    Cirone shared the comic
with two of his young patients, who, he says, pronounced it "very truthful and
exactly the way I felt.";    Nancy Fox, executive director of the Girl Scouts
of Santa Clara County, says she likes "the celebratory aspects of this story
line.";    'Really captures the emotions';  Marsha Wadley, program director
for student wellness in the San Jose Unified School District and the mother of
a 12-year-old daughter, says the strip "really captures the emotions and
feelings of what girls go through when they get periods.";    Evans says he
wanted to portray the event as one that carries no stigma or shame. Much of
the strip, in fact, has mouthy Luann using her "grown woman" status to lord it
over her best girlfriend, Bernice.;    Through it all, Luann's parents are so
supportive and wonderful that they sing "Happy woman's day to you" over a
cupcake and candle.;    "I'm not saying every family should light up the
candles and have a big party," says Evans. "Some like to keep it private. Even
in my own family, when my daughter has her period, I doubt we will have a
party."  </TEXT>
