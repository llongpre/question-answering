   The punch lines were missing when the nation's top
cartoonists gathered Tuesday, but the message was clear: ``People
who don't know how to read, don't get the point.''
   The cartoonists left the captions off a series of special
drawings to show how a person who can't read sees the comics, said
Mort Walker, author of ``Beetle Bailey'' and an organizer of
``Cartoonists For Literacy.''
   ``Comics have always helped people to read. A lot of people
learned to read by reading the comics,'' Walker said. ``And it's
our livelihood, after all. If people don't know how to read,
they're not reading our comics.''
   Walker said he got the artists together because he thought their
work could lead more people to read and encourage others to help
them learn. Thirty-three artists attended Tuesday's demonstration
and others contributed drawings.
   On display at the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library, the city's
main library, were drawings of ``Peanuts,'' ``Garfield,'' ``Hi and
Lois,'' ``Curtis,'' and ``Hagar the Horrible.''.
   The group's presentation in Dallas represents the first
organized effort by cartoonists to battle illiteracy. Cartoonists
have previously collectively dealt with such issues as hunger and
homelessness.
   Some of the cartoonists Tuesday turned out special drawings
during a program at the library. About 100 people watched as the
cartoonists took turns drawing their characters without captions,
illustrating how words make the comics funny.
   The cartoons promoting literacy will be distributed to
newspapers through syndicates.
   ``Hopefully, it'll dramatize the impact of the absence of the
punch line,'' said Bob Browne, creator of ``Hi and Lois.'' ``Most
of us who know how to read and write can't identify that readily
with what it must be like to not have that ability.''
   Browne's brother Chris, who draws ``Hagar the Horrible,'' said
the brutish but lovable Viking is well suited as a spokesman for
the effort.
   ``He can't read, so it's a natural for this sort of thing,''
Chris Browne said. ``It's a point of, not so much humor, but pathos
in our script.
   ``I think that for a long time now, cartoonists have felt that,
it's time for us, since we're communicators, to do something,'' he
said. ``It takes very little effort. In life you do whatever you
can. It's like baseball _ you bat from wherever you're standing.
And this is where we stand.''
   Bill Hinds, creator of ``Tank McNamara,'' sometimes pokes fun at
illiterate or uneducated athletes in his popular strip.
   ``The comics, I'm sure, are widely read by a lot of people who
don't read anything else in the newspaper,'' Hinds said. ``The
funny pictures attract people who don't normally read. And I trust
there are a lot of sports people out there who don't do a lot of
reading.''
