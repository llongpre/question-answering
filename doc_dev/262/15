   Cartoonist Bill Hoest, whose award-winning comic
strip ``The Lockhorns,'' has had Leroy and Loretta Lockhorn
quarreling for two decades on the nation's funny pages, has died at
age 62.
   Hoest, of Lloyd Neck, died Monday of lymphoma at New York Medical
Center.
   ``The Lockhorns,'' which celebrated its 20th anniversary in
September, is syndicated to more than 500 newspapers worldwide.
   Hoest also produced the comic strips ``What A Guy!'' and ``Agatha
Crumm'' for King Features Syndicate, the panel ``Bumper Snickers''
for The Enquirer and ``Howard Huge'' for Parade magazine.
   ``Mr. Hoest's work will continue under the creative management of
Mrs. Hoest, who has been involved with the strip for many years,''
Ted Hannah, a spokesman for King Features, said today.
   Hannah said several artists had worked with Hoest on the three
King Features strips, and the cartoonist was at least six weeks
ahead on his strips and had a large file of gags for future use.
   When Hoest created the Lockhorns in 1968, the couple began their
marriage with Leroy's retort: ``The boss's wife wants to know what
was in the recipe you served tonight ... so she can tell her
doctor.''
   ``The Lockhorns'' was named best syndicated panel of 1976 and
1980 by the National Cartoonists Society Award. This year, Hoest was
elected president of the society, the world's largest organization
of professional cartoonists.
   ``Agatha Crumm,'' begun in 1977, is a parody of the business
world that features Ms. Crumm, who has a computer-like mind and a
consuming passion for money.
   In 1979, Hoest became cartoon editor of Parade, where his panel
``Howard Huge,'' starring a lovable Saint Bernard, appears each week.
   Hoest was born Feb. 7, 1926, in Newark, N.J. After graduating
from Montclair High School, he served two years in the Navy and then
studied advertising and art at Cooper Union Art School in Manhattan.
   Hoest worked three years at Norcross Greeting Card Co. and in
1951 became a freelance artist.
   He is survived by his wife, Bunny; his mother, nine children and
stepchildren, and grandchildren. A private memorial service is to be
held Friday.
