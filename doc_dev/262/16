   About 100 newspaper editors sat down after
breakfast Wednesday _ about the time millions of their readers were
turning to the comic pages _ to discuss whether ``Cathy'' should be
political and what to do when the kids grow up in ``For Better or
Worse.''
   Serious issues these, so there wasn't a single outburst of
laughter when members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors
attended a convention workshop on what funnies they print.
   How serious?
   Well, the people who draw the comics are referred to as
``artists.'' Among those who review their works for the syndicates
that sell them to newspapers are lawyers, who have a field day with
``Doonesbury,'' and editors, who sometimes must negotiate with an
artist to tone down a character's off-color language.
   And newspaper editors who decide that a strip has gone too far
and yank it from the paper for a day or two had better brace: some
readers are sure to hurl the ugly term ``censor.''
   ``Pulling a strip draws so much attention to it and to you as a
censor, that you're reluctant to do it,'' reported Marty Claus,
managing editor for features and business at the Detroit Free Press.
   In any event, she said, readers are more worldly than editors
might think; they often don't care to be protected.
   ``People will see that Toledo ran it and Detroit didn't and
they'll say, `Let me be the judge (of what's off base),''' Ms.
Claus said.
   She plugged for more blacks and other minorities in the comics,
reporting that a month-long census of all the characters on her
paper's funny pages revealed that fewer than 1 percent were
non-white.
   Lynn Johnston, who draws ``For Better or Worse,'' the story of a
family much like hers, said she worries about how far to go in
injecting her opinion into her comic strip. She has strong opinions
on abortion, for example, and might want to express them in her
strip, but shies away and thinks: ``Can I handle it?'' She's
thin-skinned, she said, and hates hate mail.
   On the other hand, she said, ``I don't want to be a
marshmallow.''
   Another problem for Ms. Johnston was whether to let the kids in
her strip grow old. She's decided to _ it's more natural _ but
frets ``I'm going to grow right out of a job.''
   She gets heart-warming mail from loyal readers who write:
``We've been with you since Lizzie was a baby.''
   Ray Billingsley, the black artist behind ``Curtis,'' a comic
strip about a black kid, said the comics should deal with social
issues. He is itching to do a story line on crack, the cocaine
derivative, he said, but thinks he'd better let Curtis, who was
created last October, get better established first.
   ``Let these strips be bold,'' Billingsley advised the editors.
``The public is more accepting than many editors think.''
   Editors' sensitivities are an old story to Lee Salem, editorial
director of Universal Press Syndicate, who recalled what happened
last fall when a character in ``Cathy'' endorsed Michael Dukakis
for president.
   Thirty papers pulled the strip for the two-week duration of its
political wallowing and three cancelled it outright, but two of
them quickly came back, Salem said.
   He favors giving artists their freedom, after they've earned it.
Artists want to deal with AIDS, animal rights, drugs and
shoplifting, and they're bound to do it, he said.
   Ms. Claus said they should have as much freedom as columnists;
after all, she said, their names are on their strips just like a
columnist's byline.
   On one point, what constitutes a good panel, there was full
agreement: a comic strip bats 1.000 when it gets clipped out and
mailed to mom or posted on the refrigerator.
