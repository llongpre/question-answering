<TEXT>     The woman looks puzzled. Two dirty handprints of a child ring the doorknob.
Assorted toys, a tricycle, volleyball, baseball and bat litter the floor and
sofa.;    Three decades later, cartoonist Bil Keane, 67, continues to
chronicle the lighter moments of American family life. But today, many more
families share those moments. "Family Circus" now appears in 1,434 newspapers
throughout the nation and the world.;    Among the top three;  For years,
"Family Circus" -- a single-comic panel drawn inside an unconventional circle
instead of the usual rectangle -- has been the most widely circulated
syndicated comic panel in existence. Every day, it is read by more than 100
million people; readership polls consistently rank it among the top three
comics in the United States.;    Keane's cartoon characters are household
names and remain the same age year in and year out: PJ, 18 months; Jeffy, 3;
Dolly, 5; Billy, 7; and the ageless Mommy and Daddy.;    "I don't just try to
be funny," Keane said. "Many of my cartoons are not a belly laugh. I go for
nostalgia, the lump in the throat, the tear in the eye, the tug in the
heart.";    Keane was interviewed recently in his studio in the ranch-style
desert home where he and his wife, Thel, moved when they left Pennsylvania in
1959. Avid tennis players and swimmers, they have a pool and tennis court in
their spacious back yard.;    Family life has taken some dramatic swerves in
the United States since Keane began drawing "Family Circus." Yet, the
cartoonist hasn't altered his point of view.;    "The pendulum has swung
pretty far out. Some may look on my work as being corny or old hat and wonder
if my observations on the typical family are passe, what with the
single-parent family and mixed family units," mused Keane as he put finishing
touches on his latest panel.;    But "Family Circus" appears to be in tune
with the country, adding new newspapers all the time.;    Over the years, 48
books of selections from Keane's daily panels and Sunday comic strip of
"Family Circus" have been published. More than 14 million copies of the books
have been sold.;    In 1971, Keane and his neighbor, Erma Bombeck,
collaborated on one of the books, "Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your
Own." In a forward to another of Keane's books, Bombeck wrote: "Mostly I
admire and respect Bil's gentleness, his warmth, his respect for that
battered, floundering, much-maligned institution -- the American family.";   
In his book "Family Circus Treasury," Keane observed: "A reader once wrote she
would be shattered if she learned that Bil Keane was a bachelor and not the
father of a brood of small children.;    "This gives me an opportunity to set
the record straight. I would like to state I am indeed an eligible bachelor,
quite handsome, and I hate kids. I would like to state that but my wife is
proofreading this copy and I'll never get away with it.;    "The truth is I
have been happily married to Thel (Carne), my Australian bride, since 1948. We
have five children whom I love dearly and have exploited mercilessly for my
cartoons.";    Characters in Keane's comic panel are based on members of his
family. Keane himself is the bespectacled and often befuddled Daddy, Thel is
Mommy, and PJ, Billy, Jeffy and Dolly are composites of their four sons and
one daughter, and now, four grandchildren. Other real-life relatives,
including Keane's mother, Florence, the comic's gray-haired grandmother, also
pop up from time to time.;    "Although we live in the desert, I show the
family living in a typical mid-U.S., split-level house," Keane said. "Rather
than pinpointing any particular part of the country as a place where the
family lives, I would prefer to have readers think we live just down the
street from their own home.";    Keane was born in Philadelphia and grew up in
suburban Crescentville, Pa. He graduated from Northeast Catholic High School
in 1940. "I did cartoons for high school publications and then and there
decided I wanted to spend my life at the drawing board," he recalled. He had
hoped to go to art school but his parents could not afford to send him.;   
Working as a messenger at the Philadelphia Bulletin after high school, Keane
"got to sit down at the edge of drawing boards of artists." As a soldier in
World War II, he sold cartoons to national magazines and worked as a
cartoonist for Stars and Stripes. He met Thel in Brisbane.;    Keane returned
to the Philadelphia Bulletin from 1945-59, but continued to free-lance
cartoons to magazines, producing a local comic strip for the Bulletin called
"Silly Philly" and a syndicated comic strip, "Channel Chuckles," that
lampooned television. The latter ran in 200 papers at its peak and had lasted
21 years when Keane retired it in 1975.;    'Dream job';  The 5-foot-9 1/2,
145-pound cartoonist moved from Pennsylvania to Paradise Valley 31 years ago
because of his allergies. Since then he has been successfully doing what he
calls "a dream job," even though he puts in long hours every day.;   
"Cartoonists are like film producers. I am in full control of all my
characters. I decide who I want to say the lines. I'm the script writer. I do
the costumes. I direct the scenes. I edit it. The whole thing is produced by
me. I try to keep it as contemporary looking as possible, as up-to-date as
tomorrow.;    "I cannot believe that I have made my career so many years doing
what a lot of people would like to do as a hobby, drawing cartoons and getting
paid well to do it."  </TEXT>
