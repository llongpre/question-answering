The first cartoon appeared in 19 newspapers on Feb. 29, 1960. It was a drawing 
of a census taker filling out a form and asking the woman of the house: 
</P>
<P>
"Any children?" 
</P>
<P>
The woman looks puzzled. Two dirty handprints of a child ring the doorknob. 
Assorted toys, a tricycle, volleyball, baseball and bat litter the floor and 
sofa. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades later, cartoonist Bil Keane, 67, continues to chronicle the 
lighter moments of American family life. But today, many more families share 
those moments. "Family Circus" now appears in 1,434 newspapers throughout the 
nation and the world. 
</P>
<P>
For years, "Family Circus" -- the cartoon that appears inside a circle -- has 
been the most widely circulated syndicated comic panel in existence. Every day, 
it is read by more than 100 million people; readership polls consistently rank 
it among the top three comics in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Keane's cartoon characters are household names and remain the same age year in 
and year out: PJ, 18 months; Jeffy, 3; Dolly, 5; Billy, 7; and the ageless 
Mommy and Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't just try to be funny," said Keane. "Many of my cartoons are not a 
belly laugh. I go for nostalgia, the lump in the throat, the tear in the eye, 
the tug in the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Keane was interviewed recently in his studio in the ranch-style desert home 
where he and his wife, Thel, moved when they left Pennsylvania in 1959. Avid 
tennis players and swimmers, they have a pool and tennis court in their 
spacious back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Family life has taken some dramatic swerves in America since Keane began 
drawing "Family Circus." Yet, the cartoonist hasn't altered his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"The pendulum has swung pretty far out. Some may look on my work as being corny 
or old hat and wonder if my observations on the typical family are passe, what 
with the single-parent family and mixed family units," mused Keane as he put 
finishing touches on his latest panel. 
</P>
<P>
But "Family Circus," a single-comic panel drawn inside an unconventional circle 
instead of the usual rectangle, appears to be in tune with America, adding new 
newspapers all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, 48 books of selections from Keane's daily panels and Sunday 
comic strip of "Family Circus" have been published. More than 14 million copies 
of the books have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Keane and his neighbor, Erma Bombeck, collaborated on one of the 
books, "Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own." In a forward to another 
of Keane's books, Bombeck wrote: "Mostly I admire and respect Bil's gentleness, 
his warmth, his respect for that battered, floundering, much-maligned 
institution -- the American family." 
</P>
<P>
In his book "Family Circus Treasury," Keane observed: "A reader once wrote she 
would be shattered if she learned that Bil Keane was a bachelor and not the 
father of a brood of small children. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me an opportunity to set the record straight. I would like to state 
I am indeed an eligible bachelor, quite handsome, and I hate kids. I would like 
to state that but my wife is proofreading this copy and I'll never get away 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is I have been happily married to Thel (Carne), my Australian bride, 
since 1948. We have five children whom I love dearly and have exploited 
mercilessly for my cartoons." 
</P>
<P>
Characters in Keane's comic panel are based on members of his family. Keane 
himself is the bespectacled and often befuddled Daddy, Thel is Mommy, and PJ, 
Billy, Jeffy and Dolly are composites of their four sons and one daughter, and 
now, four grandchildren. Other real-life relatives, including Keane's mother, 
Florence, the comic's gray-haired grandmother, also pop up from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we live in the desert, I show the family living in a typical 
mid-U.S., split-level house," said Keane. "Rather than pinpointing any 
particular part of the country as a place where the family lives, I would 
prefer to have readers think we live just down the street from their own home." 
</P>
<P>
Keane was born in Philadelphia and grew up in suburban Crescentville, Pa. He 
graduated from Northeast Catholic High School in 1940. "I did cartoons for four 
high school publications and then and there decided I wanted to spend my life 
at the drawing board," he recalled. He had hoped to go to art school but his 
parents could not afford to send him. 
</P>
<P>
Working as a messenger at the Philadelphia Bulletin after high school, Keane 
"got to sit down at the edge of drawing boards of artists." As a soldier in 
World War II, he sold cartoons to a national magazine and worked as a 
cartoonist for Stars and Stripes. He met Thel in Brisbane. 
</P>
<P>
Keane returned to the Philadelphia Bulletin from 1945-59, but continued to 
free-lance cartoons to magazines, producing a local comic strip for the 
Bulletin called "Silly Philly" and a syndicated comic strip, "Channel 
Chuckles," that lampooned television. The latter ran in 200 papers at its peak 
and had lasted 21 years when Keane retired it in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9 1/2, 145-pound cartoonist moved to Paradise Valley 31 years ago 
"because we were sitting in a pollen pocket in Bucks County, Pa., where I was 
bothered by allergies and constantly sneezing. In Arizona, I seldom sneeze." 
</P>
<P>
There have been three TV specials based on Keane's comic characters. And, for 
the past three years, the cartoonist has been producing twice-monthly 
inspirational posters that hang in more than 4,000 elementary schools across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Thel and Bil's daughter, Gayle, 40, runs a Sacramento floral shop called 
Bloomingayle's. Son Neil, 38, is a computer design engineer in Los Angeles; 
Glen, 35, is a animator for Disney Studios; Chris, 33, is a feature writer for 
the Santa Cruz Sentinel; and Jeff, 32, lives in Laguna Nigel and helps his 
father with the panel and Sunday comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff pencils some of the drawings, roughs the art, finishes it. If I retire, 
get too ill to do it or die, Jeff will continue the feature," said Keane, who, 
at 67, entertains no thought of retiring. "Why should I quit when I enjoy what 
I'm doing? I plan to continue to draw as long as they're able to prop me up at 
a drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
Keane keeps a drawer in his desk filled with hundreds of ideas for future 
panels written on 3-by-5 cards. "Any time I get an idea, I jot it down. Often, 
I wake up in the middle of the night with a brainstorm and write that down. Not 
one of the more than 10,950 panels I have done in the last 30 years are alike. 
I have enough material here to keep Jeff going for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, who handles the business side of the Keane comic, is the model for 
the comic strip's Mommy as well as his tennis partner. "Thel looks at 
everything before I send it to the syndicate. Thel is the inspiration for a lot 
of things, a lot of the philosophy behind 'Family Circus' comes from her," said 
Keane. 
</P>
<P>
Keane considers life as a successful comic cartoonist "a dream job . . . King 
Features Syndicate splits the revenue 50-50 with me. Some papers pay as little 
as $5 a week, others in excess of $200 a week for the comic, depending on 
circulation," he explained. "I'm my own boss, make my own hours. (But) I put in 
long hours every day. It's a tedious and exacting craft. 
</P>
<P>
"Cartoonists are like film producers. I am in full control of all my 
characters. I decide who I want to say the lines. I'm the script writer. I do 
the costumes. I direct the scenes. I edit it. The whole thing is produced by 
me. I try to keep it as contemporary looking as possible, as up-to-date as 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that I have made my career so many years doing what a lot of 
people would like to do as a hobby, drawing cartoons and getting paid well to 
do it."
