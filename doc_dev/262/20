   Crimestoppers Tip No. 236: always
question the curator.
   Authorities in Rye Brook did just that, and solved The Case of
the Missing Comic Strips by arresting 27-year-old Sherman Krisher
of Greenwich, Conn., who allegedly swiped 30 original ``Dick
Tracy'' cartoons.
   The former curator at the Museum of Cartoon Art was charged
Thursday with stealing more than $50,000 worth of original comic
strips, including Tracy and ``Prince Valiant'' panels, said
Westchester County District Attorney Carl Vergari.
   Krisher, who worked his way up from janitor to curator in seven
years at the museum, was charged with grand larceny in the second
degree.
   Rye Town Justice Bruno Gioffre released Krisher in his own
recognizance after his arraignment on the charges Thursday morning,
said Assistant District Attorney Tony Berk. Krisher is due back in
court on May 18.
   More than 50 strips were taken and allegedly sold to comic strip
dealers. The theft was discovered in January, Museum Director
Barbara Hammond said, and Krisher confessed to theft and was fired
in March.
   ``The temptation was too great,'' she said.
   The Dick Tracy strips were valued at up to $2,000 each,
according to collectors. The strips of the syndicated cartoon had
been donated to the museum by its creator, Chester Gould.
