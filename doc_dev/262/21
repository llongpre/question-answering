<TEXT>     The strips Dr. Dallis created are published in more than 400 U.S.
newspapers with an estimated readership of more than 60 million.;    Dr.
Dallis, a 1938 graduate of Temple University School of Medicine in
Philadelphia, was born in New York and practiced general medicine and later
psychiatry in Toledo, Ohio, where he became medical director of a
mental-health clinic.;    The success of the three strips prompted him to
close his psychiatric practice and move to Arizona in 1958, where he devoted
full time to the comics, although he served on the board of directors of
Camelback Hospital, a psychiatric facility.;    Dr. Dallis did not draw the
cartoons, which were done by professional artists. He wrote the stories weeks
in advance of publication.;    Services are scheduled Wednesday at Green Acres
Mortuary in Scottsdale.;    He is survived by his wife, Sally, a former nurse
who was the inspiration for Apartment 3-G; two daughters; and a son.  </TEXT>
