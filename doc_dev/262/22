<HEAD>Breathed to Discontinue `Bloom County' Aug. 6</HEAD>

   Cartoonist Berke Breathed says he will
discontinue his Pulitzer Prize-winning comic strip ``Bloom County''
on Aug. 6, and begin a new, Sunday-only strip the next month.
   The announcement from the Washington Post Writers Group was
reported in today's edition of the Post. It quoted Breathed as
saying ``A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon.''
   ``Bloom County,'' featuring Opus the penguin and a cast of other
characters from the fictional locale, quickly became one of the
nation's most popular comic strips after its introduction in
December 1980. It is now carried by nearly 800 daily and college
newspapers.
   Breathed, 31, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished
cartooning in 1987.
   In the announcement, Breathed said: ``The ugly truth is that in
most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators. `Bloom
County' is retiring before the stretch marks show.''
   The cartoonist declined to comment beyond the prepared statement.
   But William Dickinson, general manager and editorial director of
the Writers Group, which distributes `Bloom County,'' said Breathed
had been considering such a move for about a year.
   ``This was not an impetuous decision on Berke's part,''
Dickinson said. ``He thinks the strip may be past its peak in some
way, which isn't true, but that's his decision.''
   Dickinson declined to give details about the new strip planned
by Breathed. ``It will have a different name,'' he said. Asked if
any of the ``Bloom County'' characters might appear in the new
strip, he said, ``Apparently not, with maybe one exception.''
   He declined to elaborate.
   Six collections of ``Bloom County'' strips have been published
by Little, Brown and Co., with 4 million sold, the Writers Group
said.
