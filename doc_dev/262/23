<HEAD>`Garfield' Creator Wins Cartoonist of the Year Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Davis, creator of fat cat ``Garfield,'' was
named Cartoonist of the Year on May 5 by the National Cartoonists
Society.
   After six years as a nominee, Davis, of Albany, Ind., won the
``Reuben'' _ the cartoon world's equivalent of the Oscar _ for the
cynical, overfed Garfield, featured on television specials and many
novelty items as well as newspaper cartoons.
   The award was presented during the group's annual meeting,
aboard a cruise ship in the Caribbean, said Selma Gore, spokeswoman
for the society.
   The award, a 16-inch bronze statue designed by the late
cartoonist Rube Goldberg, founder of the 44-year-old society, shows
eight people tangled together around an inkstand.
   Awards for excellence also were given in five categories. Johnny
Hart of Endicott, N.Y., who draws ``B.C.'' and ``Wizard of Id,''
was honored for best newspaper strips and panels. The newspaper
editorial and sports award went to Pat Oliphant of Falls Church, Va.

<BYLINE>NOTES FROM EVERYWHERE</BYLINE>

   Andy Rooney, suspended by CBS for three weeks after being quoted
as making remarks offensive to blacks and homosexuals, says special
interest groups are squelching debate on television and in
politics. The United States has become a nation ``that doesn't say
what it thinks about so many things'' for fear of those groups, he
told a meeting of the Constitutional Rights Foundation in Los
Angeles. ``There are organized minorities for almost every cause,
and politicians, along with network executives, are scared to death
of them.'' ... John Quinn, the former editor in chief of USA Today,
criticizes the excessive use of unnamed sources. ``I pity the poor
reader who is asked to believe `informed sources,''' Quinn told the
Nevada State Press Association. ``If the press required informed
sources to put their names in stories, there would be a lot less
lying.''
