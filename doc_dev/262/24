<LEADPARA>  Sunday's "Doonesbury" comic strip by Garry Trudeau could generate an angry
reaction among readers, according to warnings from some newspaper editors and
the strip's syndicator.;    The strip, which will be published in the Mercury
News, deals with the bleak living conditions of troops stationed in Saudi
Arabia.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the first panel, Trudeau drew a soldier who tells readers, "Check out
these cartoon dispatches from the front, created by 'Zorro,' an airman
stationed at Central Command in Saudi Arabia.";    The rest of the strip
presents Zorro's black-humor takes on life at the front. Panels include a man
in fatigues roasting on a spit above the words "Desert Shield Rotation
Policy," a soldier who had hanged himself after months of waiting for mail
from home, and an off-course Scud missile hitting a bored soldier dead-on.;   
Zorro titled his seven scenes of military life "Living in Purgatory.";    The
strip's distributor, Kansas City-based Universal Press Syndicate, was
skeptical about running the panels at first, said Lee Salem, editorial
director of the company. But Trudeau convinced them Zorro was a real person
and a member of the Air Force stationed at Central Command, Salem said.;   
"Zorro had put some of his cartoons on the bulletin boards of Central
Command," said Salem, acting as a spokesman for the publicity-shy Trudeau. "He
began corresponding with Garry, and Garry decided he wanted to show Zorro's
work to the public. Zorro's the real thing." (Trudeau isn't drawing next
week's strips, either. He's reportedly too sick with the flu to draw new
panels, so the syndicate is sending reruns.);    Salem said the syndicate
received the completed Sunday drawings from Trudeau Dec. 24, three weeks
before the outbreak of war. "There's no question that it's still relevant, if
not more so," he said.;    Still, Salem acknowledged that the Sunday strip
could elicit a hostile response from some readers.;    "It's a little macabre,
but my guess is that it expresses the situation of a lot of troops over
there," Salem said. "We might get some negative reaction, and we expect that.
But we think it holds up.";    Salem said he wasn't aware of any newspapers
planning to pull the strip.;    "It's interesting to see satire straight from
the front," said Jerome M. Ceppos, managing editor of the Mercury News.
"Because of the incredibly tight restrictions on information, 'Doonesbury'
ends up giving us a better picture of life for our servicemen and women than
the Pentagon has.";    The Newport News (Va.) Daily Press, published in one of
the most military-dense parts of the country, chose to run the Sunday strip
despite the possible response, said Jack W. Davis Jr., vice president and
editor of the newspaper.;    "Some people at first are going to be offended at
what they think is tastelessness or lack of sensitivity," he said. "But on
second glance, they should remember that it does reveal the thinking of some
people actually deployed in the desert.";    Salem said angry readers, if
there are any, should keep their perspective.;    "As long as readers know
that Trudeau didn't draw this and that it was done before war started, it's
totally appropriate," he said. "We're talking about a life-and-death
situation, not light comedy."  </TEXT>
