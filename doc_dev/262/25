   Say bye-bye to Bill The Cat, the drug-addled
feline who's smooched Jeane Kirkpatrick and swapped brains with
Donald Trump. Bill and the other residents of ``Bloom County'' are
soon to be history, the latest victims of funny-page flameout.
   Cartoonist Berke Breathed pulled the plug on the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Bloom County'' earlier this week, becoming the
third comic-page fixture to leave fans hanging in recent years.
   But while Garry Trudeau and Gary Larson put their characters on
vacation when cartooning became a grind, Breathed opted to off his.
   ``A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon. The
ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than
their creators. `Bloom County' is retiring before the stretch marks
show,'' Breathed said in explaining his decision.
   Readers of nearly 800 newspapers now will learn to live without
big-beaked penguin Opus, his buddy Milo and motley party animal
Bill The Cat; no longer will their lives intersect those of
Kirkpatrick, Trump or Lee Iacocca _ three public figures frequently
skewered by Breathed.
   But such bad news is becoming all too common for the discerning
comic reader, who in the recent years has lost Larson's ``The Far
Side'' and Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' for extended periods while
their creators escaped the day-to-day drudgery.
   ``I need a breather. Investigative cartooning is a young man's
game,'' said Trudeau in announcing his hiatus from January 1983 to
September 1984 _ a move that was questioned by veteran cartoonists
such as Milton Caniff of ``Steve Canyon.''
   ``Another guy is waiting in the wings, and once you're out you
often can't get back in _ the space is filled,'' said Caniff, who
has since died.
   Similarly, Larson's syndicate editor, Lee Salem, explained the
cartoonist ``felt he needed to get away from the deadline situation
for a while so he could try to regenerate his cells.'' ``The Far
Side'' is due back in 1990.
   While Trudeau and Larson took breathers to escape burnout,
Breathed will resume his career with an entirely new Sundays-only
strip.
   Others in the business say they understand his decision; penning
a daily strip is anything but a million laughs for its creator.
   ``It's like pedaling a bicycle above a rotating blade, knowing
that if you stop you'll fall and get cut up,'' said ``Peanuts''
cartoonist Charles Schulz, whose strip is in its fourth decade.
   ``You can't plan like a novelist, where you have three or four
years to work,'' said Schulz. ``A cartoonist doesn't have time to
stop. It's go, go, go continuously.''
   Breathed's strip says sayonara Aug. 6, although there is hope
that one resident of ``Bloom County'' _ nobody's saying which one _
may survive its doomsday.
   The cartoonist's new characters will not resemble the old ones
``with maybe one exception,'' said William Dickinson, general
manager and editorial director of The Washington Post Writers
Group, which syndicates the strip.
   Opus, anyone?
