   Good grief: The Peanuts gang is turning 40.
   The images are embedded in American popular culture: Charlie
Brown trying to kick a football, Snoopy gunning for the Red Baron
and Lucy dispensing psychiatric advice, a nickel's worth at a time.
   Now it's time to celebrate.
   In honor of the 40th anniversary of the comic strip ``Peanuts,''
there's a jazz concert at Carnegie Hall, a birthday party at the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and a special exhibit
at the Smithsonian Institution.
   On Oct. 2, 1950, ``Peanuts'' made its debut in seven newspapers,
and good ol' Charlie Brown and his beguiling beagle were on their
way to becoming an international phenomenon.
   Today the strip runs in 2,300 newspapers and reaches more than
200 million readers a day in 68 countries. The Peanuts gang speaks
Chinese, even Serbo-Croatian.
   There's been a hit musical, ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' a series of TV specials and a book on the philosophical
and religious implications of the strip, ``The Gospel According to
Peanuts.''
   In September, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz was one of Forbes
magazine's top 10 richest entertainers, with earnings for 1989 and
1990 estimated at $54 million.
   Unlike many cartoonists, the 67-year-old Schulz still draws
every comic strip himself.
   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?''
he asked. ``They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for
them if they didn't.
   ``That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.''
   The cartoonist was born in St. Paul, Minn. He studied art in
high school, after he saw a ``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
   Schulz later did lettering for a church comic book, taught art
and sold cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His cartoon feature
``Li'l Folks,'' the forerunner of Peanuts, was developed for the
St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. The strip was sold to a syndicate
in 1950, and the name changed to ``Peanuts.''
   Charlie, the round-headed boy in the sawtooth shirt, was named
after a friend at art school and is the cartoonist's alter ego.
Snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as a child.
   The little red-haired girl - Charlie's unrequited love who is
never shown in the strip - was based on a girlfriend who rejected
Schulz's proposal of marriage.
   Through the years, for the millions of readers, Charlie and his
gang have been like family. Followers know that Snoopy - in his
World War I flying ace incarnation - flies a Sopwith Camel. They
know Linus needs his security blanket and awaits the Great Pumpkin
every Halloween. They know Schroeder plays Beethoven on his tiny
piano.
   The 40th birthday festivities kicked off at the Super Bowl in
New Orleans in January with a halftime show featuring the Peanuts
characters.
   On Monday, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County will
salute Charlie, Snoopy, Linus, Schroeder, Peppermint Patty, Sally,
Lucy - and Schulz - with an exhibit that premiered at the Louvre in
January.
   There will be original artwork by Schulz, excerpts from the more
than 40 Peanuts television shows and Snoopy mementos that were
carried aboard NASA's Apollo 10 mission.
   New York City will toast Schulz and his characters Oct. 24 with
a jazz concert at Carnegie Hall, featuring saxophonist Grover
Washington Jr. and bassist Ron Carter. The Peanuts TV special have
been noted for their original jazz scores.
   Opening Oct. 30 at the Smithsonian is ``This is Your Childhood,
Charlie Brown - Children in American Culture, 1945-1970,'' an
exhibit that looks at how Schulz's comic strips reflected childhood
and American culture after World War II.
   There will also be a ``Snoopy: The Universal Dog'' exhibit at
the Dog Museum in St. Louis, starting Nov. 11. A Peanuts exhibit is
now on display at the Museum of Cartoon Art in San Francisco.
