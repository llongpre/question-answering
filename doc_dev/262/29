<HEAD>Activist Eighth-Grader Campaigns to Save ``Bloom County'' Comic Strip</HEAD>

   An eighth-grader is petitioning Berke
Breathed to keep drawing his ``Bloom County'' comic strip, but the
cartoonist's editor says it's probably a lost cause.
   Breathed plans to substitute a Sunday-only strip for the daily
``Bloom County,'' which was introduced in December 1980 and in 1987
won a Pulitzer Prize.
   Al Leeds, who edits the strip for the Washington Post Writer's
Group, has already had a peek at the new cartoon, which he said is
being kept under wraps for now.
   But he revealed one secret: Opus isn't saying farewell after all.
   ``Opus the penguin will eventually appear in the new strip,''
Leeds promised. ``But he will only be a supporting character and
certainly not the protagonist.''
   Eric Gustafson, 13, has launched a grass-roots effort to convince
Breathed to keep alive Opus, along with Steve Dallas, Milo Bloom and
the rest of the strip's characters. And Gustafson isn't alone.
   ``The warmth of those characters was really something and it's
been an exceptional show of regret that Berke's ending it,'' said
Leeds, who signed Breathed to a contract in 1980 and watched the
strip spread to about 800 daily and college newspapers nationwide.
   Breathed's mail has more than doubled lately to as many as 250
letters a week, said Suzanne Whelton, an editorial assistant at the
Washington Post Writer's Group.
   ``There are some pretty distraught people out there,'' she said.
   Gustafson counts himself among them.
   ``I'm sure `Bloom County' has a lot of fans nationally who are
upset, so we're trying to get something started locally and hope it
will spread,'' said the Northboro Middle School student, who's so
far collected about 100 petition signatures.
   The cartoonist was out of the country and unavailable for comment
Thursday, but Leeds rated slim-to-none the chances Breathed would
reconsider his decision to terminate the comic strip.
