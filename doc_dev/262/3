   Garfield pined for the comforts of home while outdoors in a
rainstorm, and Marmaduke invited homeless dogs to his house for
breakfast as cartoonists focused on the plight of the needy in
today's comic pages.
   More than 100 comic-strip and editorial cartoonists, including
the creators of ``Garfield'' and ``Marmaduke,'' participated.
   ``The goal of the project is to tug at America's heart strings
through its funny bones. Tomorrow's funny pages are not going to be
so funny,'' Barry Zigas, of the National Low Income Housing
Coalition, said during a news conference Monday in Washington.
   Some of the cartoons had a serious tone. Others found a humorous
tilt to a not-so-funny issue. In ``The Lockhorns'' a suited-man
tells a homeless man cooking over a fire, ``I'd ask you home for a
good home-cooked meal but you're better off here.''
   ``It's not going to change things overnight; it's just one more
expression of the movement,'' said cartoonist Mell Lazarus, who
draws the comic strip ``Momma.''
   In his strip, Momma's son raids her refrigerator because he
doesn't have any food at his apartment. Momma tells him, ``Francis,
do you realize there are people in this country who are totally
homeless, while you have two of them?''
   ``If a kid tells his parents, `Hey look. All the comics are
about homeless people today,' we will at least have raised their
consciousness,'' Lazarus said Monday in Los Angeles.
   In ``The Family Circus'', by Bil Keane, a youngster asks about a
homeless man sleeping on a bench, `But, if he doesn't have a home,
how can his children come for a visit?''
   Paul Conrad, editorial cartoonist for the Los Angeles Times,
said, ``I'm participating because I'm trying to attract attention
to the homeless, but I've been drawing about the homeless for years
and so far it hasn't had any effect.'' His cartoon on the homeless
will appear later this week.
   In the Boston Herald, editorial cartoonist Jerry Holbert showed
a homeless man on a park bench covered with newspapers advertising
expensive houses.
   The Atlanta Constitution's Doug Marlette, winner of this year's
Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartoons, showed a group of street
people with the U.S. Capitol in the distance. The caption reads:
``Land of the Free, Homeless of the Brave.''
   In The Miami Herald, editorial cartoonist Jim Morin drew a
bedraggled man slumped in a doorway flanked by shopping bags
overflowing with clothes. Near the door is a sign with the message:
``Home is where the heart isn't.''
   Bill DeOre, of The Dallas Morning News, fashioned a weather face
formed by the words: mentally ill; jobless; addiction; illiteracy.
   Zigas, noting that there are no official counts of the number of
homeless, said national estimates range from 350,000 to more than 3
million.
   ``Hunger and homelessness are not partisan issues, they are
human tragedies that deserve our immediate attention,'' said Zigas,
an organizer of the cartoonists' effort.
   ``There is a shameful level of hunger in the United States,
although it is not as visible as homelessness,'' added Robert Fersh
of the Food Research Action Center.
   Millions more than that are hungry, Fersh said, adding that
children make up a large share of those without enough to eat.
   Other cartoonists participating included Garry Trudeau, author
of ``Doonesbury;'' Dik Browne, creator of ``Hagar the Horrible;''
``B.C.'' artist Johnny Hart; and Tom Batiuk, developer of
``Crankshaft.''
