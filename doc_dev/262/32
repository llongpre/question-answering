   Life has never been more normal for the
Simpsons: Dad gives Bronx cheers at the opera, mom hides valuables
in her colossal hairdo and the sluggish son attempts to win
Scrabble games with the word ``kwyjibo.''
   Pushing all of the conventions of the domestic television sitcom
through a paper shredder and then weaving the scraps into new and
often peculiar tales, the makers of Fox's ``The Simpsons'' are
trying to establish the first prime-time cartoon since ``The
Jetsons'' and ``The Bullwinkle Show'' in the early 1960s.
   ``The Simpsons,'' seen regularly as short features on Fox's
``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' debuts as a weekly half-hour series on
Fox on Sunday at 8:30 p.m., replacing the science-themed news show
``Beyond Tomorrow.''
   But don't grab a stack of Pop Tarts and a glass of Tang and
expect Saturday-morning fluff: With episodes focusing on themes
like son Bart's stupidity and dad Homer's inability to provide for
his family, ``The Simpsons'' bears much closer resemblance to Fox's
``Married ... With Children'' than to ``The Smurfs.''
   It might be colorful, but it's a little dark, too.
   ``In my comic strip I'm trying to entertain a certain segment of
the audience and annoy another segment, and I'm not trying to do
that with the TV show,'' said Matt Groening, the show's creator and
the author of the wry and insightful cartoon ``Life in Hell'' and
the related books ``Work is Hell'' and ``Love is Hell.''
   ``I know I can annoy people,'' said Groening (rhymes with
raining, sort of). ``It's more fun to try to take an audience and
make them laugh in spite of themselves. It's a different kind of
challenge. ... This is a family entertainment show. It's not aimed
at kids, though.''
   Groening said ``The Simpsons'' is ``certainly harder-edged than
any TV cartoon in recent memory.'' Which isn't to say it's not
funny in a strange, unpredictable way: When Homer taunts animals at
the zoo, you don't really expect a television show _ much less a
cartoon _ to show dad pelted in the face with monkey muck.
   ``The Simpsons are on the slow side,'' Groening said. ``But one
of the good things about it is that we can resist the temptation to
put clever lines in their mouths. That's my problem with most TV
sitcoms _ these lines that come out of these characters' mouths are
utterly unbelievable. So our cleverness lies elsewhere.
   ``At the same time, I don't think that the show has any of that
superior snottiness. We like the characters ... they make dumb
decisions and they act on whatever emotion occurs to them at the
moment, but that's part of the humor.
   ``The show is ultimately a celebration _ it's about having a
good time.''
   ``The Simpsons'' will have to survive in a television
marketplace where cartoons are either toy-oriented syndicated
strips or huggable Saturday morning specials where a real crisis
occurs when a bear loses his sweater.
   It's a new working environment for Groening, who writes and
draws his comics in his Venice, Calif., home and works on ``The
Simpsons'' on the busy Fox lot.
   ``I got very used to working by myself, but it got lonely,
too,'' Groening said. ``And it's really fun to be around people
having a blast doing what they are doing. Almost all of the
animators are obsessed by the medium _ and they're passionately
enthusiastic about their work when they're not exhausted.''
   The show was created by Groening, and developed by Groening, Sam
Simon and Oscar-winning filmmaker James L. Brooks (``Broadcast
News'').
   ``Life in Hell,'' Groening's weekly comic, is admittedly not a
work of high cartoon art. ``The animators (for `The Simpsons') had
to learn a more primitive way of drawing,'' Groening said.
   ``It was really a struggle a get everybody lined up and facing
the same direction, because every one of the animators can draw
better than I can. There's a simplicity and clarity in the design
of my characters that we wanted to bring to the TV show.
   ``In my comic strip I'm limited, because if I can't draw it, I
won't do it. But with `The Simpsons' I can think up ideas that I
could never draw.''

   Elsewhere in Television:
   `THE BEAR' _ Bart, Hollywood's most sought-after Kodiak bear and
the co-star of the hit film ``The Bear,'' will guest star on ``The
Young Riders'' on Feb. 8 on ABC. Previous credits for Bart _ a
9-foot, 1,800-pound bundle of joy - include ``Clan of the Cave
Bear'' and ``The Great Outdoors''...
