<LEADPARA>  WHY ARE CARTOON AND COMIC strip characters drawn with gigantic noses or some
other disfiguring feature?;   CHECK IT OUT: CHARLIE BROWN SUFFERS from
megacephalism. His head is a nearly hairless globe bigger than his torso. Andy
Capp's nose is the size of a grapefruit. The King in "The Wizard of Id" has a
nose the size of a watermelon. And Cathy has no nose whatsoever. Just a blank
spot. No wonder she can't get dates!  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Why do cartoonists distort their subjects? Because otherwise they'd have
Mary Worth on their hands. They'd have Judge Parker.;   A caricature is a way
to communicate a message. Caricaturist David Levine calls comic strips
"hieroglyphics." Levine, who draws for the New York Review of Books, noted
that Leonardo da Vinci experimented with caricature as a way of imbuing his
figures with some special menace or ugliness. A standard, symmetrical face is
plain and meaningless; this is one of the problems that Dan Quayle faces,
because his cookie-cutter good looks lend themselves to the perception of
vapidity.;   We asked some other famous cartoonists for their thoughts.;  
Berkeley Breathed, creator of "Outland" and "Bloom County": "There's nothing
that lends itself to stretching more than a nose sticking at a right angle out
from a face, and invariably it keeps getting longer and longer." He said that
when Opus the penguin had a nose job a while back, readers were furious. "Opus
would not be Opus without a big nose. It leads him into trouble. It's where
his brains are.";   Paul Conrad, political cartoonist: "Quite unconsciously
during the Nixon trauma, I started off with his head and shoulders about where
they ought to be, and by the time I was finished they (the shoulders) were way
up in back of his head." Like? "The hunchback of Notre Dame.";   Pat Oliphant,
political cartoonist: "You don't stretch just for the sake of stretching it.
What you are trying to do is convey character, as you see it." He said that
with George Bush he emphasizes "thinness, meagerness," and adds, "I think his
eyes are moving closer together, as did Carter's, as did Reagan's. It's kind
of a vacuous look that he's developing.";   As for Quayle, Oliphant says the
vice president can be drawn with "blunked out" eyes -- a Walt ("Pogo") Kelly
term for no pupils. The veep looks like Little Orphan Danny.  </TEXT>
