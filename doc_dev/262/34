Back on the 'Far Side': New installments of the cult comic strip "The Far Side" 
will return to newspapers across America on New Year's Day, following a 
14-month hiatus. Cartoonist Gary Larson took a break on Oct. 30, 1988, from one 
of the most successful panels in comic-strip history. During that time, 
newspapers ran reprints of earlier "classic" cartoons. The only thing Larson 
drew on his sabbatical was an album cover for jazz guitarist Herb Ellis -- in 
exchange for guitar lessons. "I feel very fresh and recharged, and I'm sure a 
reduced work load will play a big role in maintaining that feeling," Larson 
said. "But, as I'm sure anyone who has had an opportunity to take a full year 
off will agree, that first Monday morning back at work is quite a sobering 
experience." DANIEL CERONE and SHAUNA SNOW
