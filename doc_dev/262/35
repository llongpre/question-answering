<LEADPARA>  Who says the only celebrated people from Indiana are Jane Pauley and David
Letterman? Certainly not the officials who decided to salute native Hoosiers
Ryan White, Ken Kercheval, Jim Davis and Birch Bayh. The heartland notables
were immortalized Sunday when their names were placed in the Walk of Legends
at the Indiana State Fair.;   Kercheval, Davis and Bayh signed their names
into wet concrete in the walk outside the Fairgrounds Coliseum. White, who
died last year of AIDS at 18, was represented by his mother, Jeanne White.  </LEADPARA>

strip, is a native of Fairmount.;   Bayh, a native of Terre Haute, served 18
years in the U.S. Senate and is a lawyer in Washington. He is also the father
