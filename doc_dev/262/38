   Nick at Nite, the cable channel that has
revived old sitcoms for prime time, is getting its own new cartoon
series.
   But Ralph Bakshi's ``Tattertown'' will fit right in _ it's about
discarded objects that come to life.
   Bakshi said the concept of ``Tattertown'' began as doodling in
high school.
   ``It's been in development for 25 years,'' Bakshi declared.
``It's my monster. It started in high school as a comic strip. It
was an excuse to make fun of who we are by the objects we throw
away. `Tattertown' is a world where everything we once owned comes
alive.''
   ``Tattertown'' debuts Wednesday on Nick at Night with a Christmas
special that introduces Debbie and her stuffed doll Muffit.
   Debbie is the only human in a world where inanimate objects come
to life. Muffit becomes the evil ruler of this magical world, while
Debbie struggles to bring her back to the real world.
   Thirty-nine additional half-hour episodes will be shown on Nick
at Nite in 1989 and 1990.
   ``It's nostalgic, with cartoons and stuff from the 1920s and
'30s,'' said Bakshi, who is best known for such adult animated
features as ``Fritz the Cat,'' ``Heavy Traffic,'' ``Coonskin,''
``The Lord of the Rings'' and ``American Pop.'' He also produces
``Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures'' for CBS.
   ``Tattertown,'' he said, ``has a kind of 1926 style to it. This
is my first true-to-life thing for kids. My other cartoons were more
for adults. It's my first step into Disney's world of wholesome
stuff for kids. Still, I think adults will like the nostalgia of it.
   ``It won't be as satiric as `Mighty Mouse.' I think kids will see
those wonderful toys running around. I think they'll get it. You
can't talk down to them. We'll have three kinds of music. Paul
Whiteman white-bread music, Duke Ellington sophisticated jazz and
hot jazz like Fats Waller and Fletcher Henderson.''
   Bakshi was in his cramped studios located in what looks like an
old motel in Van Nuys. Drawings were pinned all over the walls, and
every inch of space was taken up with animators working on the
celluloid frames.
   One of his directors, Maurice Noble, worked on ``Snow White'' for
Walt Disney and on various cartoons at Warner Bros.
   Bakshi said he was approached by Nick at Nite after he completed
work on ``Mighty Mouse.''
   About half the animation will be done at his studios and the rest
overseas. ``We do more animation here than most companies,'' he
said. ``We do all the key posing and timing. Besides, my motto is if
you don't have animators around who can you yell at?''
   Bakshi grew up wanting to become another Al Capp, creator of the
newspaper comic strip ``Li'l Abner.''
   At the age of 21 he became the youngest animator in the business
at Terrytoons. He was soon promoted to director and at 24 was the
studio's creative director.
   On the side he drew ``Fearless Fosdick'' sequences for Capp's
``Li'l Abner.'' He made numerous attempts to start his own comic
strip, but he was turned down by all the syndicates.
   ``I quit Terrytoons and started my own studio when I was about
27,'' he said. ``I didn't know what I was doing. The first thing I
did was `Fritz the Cat.'''
   ``Fritz'' got an ``X'' rating when it was released in 1972. It
attracted a lot of attention, and Bakshi picked up a reputation as
rebel.
   ``I'm just an artist who runs a studio and tries to uphold the
rights of artists,'' he said. ``I'm not a rebel. I've had a lot of
troubles. I just want my freedom of speech. I want to be able to
express myself. I just want to do my job. `Fritz' was a great
cartoon. `Heavy Traffic' was better.''
   He leaned back in his chair. ``I'm not a rebel,'' he said. ``I've
mellowed out.''
   Bakshi will also produce and direct an animated special based on
Dr. Seuss' ``The Butter Battle Book.'' Ted Geisel, who writes under
the name of Dr. Seuss, is writing the script and lyrics for the
songs. Chuck Jones, who directed the Peabody Award-winning Seuss
classic ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' will be a consultant.

   Elsewhere in television:
   STAYING SOBER _ The anti-alcohol campaign by the Harvard School
of Public Health has been enthusiastically adopted by the television
industry, according to communications director Jay Winsten. Public
service spots against drunk driving are being telecast during the
holiday season. Many series are now writing anti-alcohol dialogue
into their scripts. Scenes showing drinking will have a word of
caution and mention the need for a ``designated driver'' who has not
been drinking.
