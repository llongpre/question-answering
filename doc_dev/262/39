<LEADPARA>  THIS week Blondie Bumstead, wife of Dagwood Bumstead and mother of Alexander
and Cookie Bumstead, comes up with the craziest notion she's had in nearly six
decades: "I could go out and get a job!";   King Features Syndicate Group,
which distributes the comic strip to more than 2,000 newspapers, describes
Blondie's decision to enter the workplace as "the biggest thing to happen to
an American icon since Superman got married."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's certainly a profound change in her lifestyle. Mrs. Bumstead has been a
full-time homemaker for all 58 years of her marriage.;   This change may be
used to spur all kinds of discussions about women's-movement issues such as
gender bias, sex harassment and equal-pay-for-equal- work or to make
statements about the economic pressures that have forced so many women to
work. But Blondie's creator says he isn't thinking of using his bombshell to
examine those issues, because that's simply not her style.;   But once this
tall, attractive, blond rookie-in-the-world-of-work gets out there there's no
telling what spin her creators might ultimately put on her experiences.;  
After all, this is a woman who is weary of housework but who has also been
aging magnificently along with her husband and her two children, who were born
more than 50 years ago and are still only teen-agers. No telling what might
happen when she ventures out from the nest.;   It should also be noted that
the transformation of the Bumsteads into a two-income household is not a sign
that this vital, golden-tressed American icon is suffering from anemic
funny-paper ratings. "Blondie" cartoonist Dean Young says his chief motive was
to establish a fresh source for gags.;   "I've been thinking about doing this
for a couple of years," he says. "I wanted something that opens a whole area
for new material. I agonized about what the perfect business for her to go
into would be. I wanted something that would be helpful to me and would give
her the credibility she deserves to have.";   He discarded several
possibilities -- including substitute teacher -- before settling on the
occupation that dare not yet speak its name.;   "I decided what I'd have her
do it about a year and a half ago," Young says, "and I let the idea sit in my
brain and percolate, which is the way the process works for me. Ultimately,
the idea sort of took control, and I started getting sparks from it, and I
realized I could do this with it and that with it, and I started
experimenting, and it just felt right.";   According to the syndicate
"Blondie" may be the world's most popular comic strip. The strip is translated
into 55 languages and read by 250 million people -- in places as diverse as
Kuwait and New Guinea.;   Its longevity is equally noteworthy. "Blondie" soon
will observe its 61st anniversary, which makes it ancient for this species.;  
The strip made its debut Sept. 8, 1930; the creator was Murat B. Young, Dean's
father, who went by the nickname Chic.;   If Chic Young had stuck to his
original concept, Blondie and Dagwood would probably be in comic-strip
heaven.;   Blondie Boopadoop; In the beginning, Dagwood was a 1920s-style
playboy, party animal, polo player and heir to a fabulous fortune amassed by
his father, J. Bolling Bumstead, a railroad magnate. Mostly, though, Dagwood
was a dweeb.;   Blondie Boopadoop -- yes, Boopadoop -- was a sexy,
much-sought-after and very frivolous flapper.;   Dagwood was among those in
pursuit, chasing Blondie big-time despite the abiding disapproval of his
parents, who desperately wanted to curtail their son's romance with this
unconventional -- and thus unacceptable -- femme.;   Joseph Connolly, the
general manager of King Features, had some worries of his own. He felt the
strip's wealthy, vapid characters might no longer be amusing to people caught
in the Depression.;   Connolly had a remedy. He told Young to go back to the
drawing board and start over. Young did, and had Blondie and Dagwood fall
deeply and genuinely in love, which was rare in comics.;   Then they were
engaged -- despite J. Bolling's threat to disinherit his son if they were
married.;   They were, and J. Bolling did. The wedding was Feb. 17, 1933.
Suddenly Dagwood and Blondie found themselves in the ranks of the nation's
struggling, middle-class married couples, which was the right place to be.;  
Under Chic Young's brilliant direction, the Bumsteads and their employers,
friends, postman, pets, antics and habits have secured a lasting niche in the
national consciousness.;   Contribution to cuisine; The Dagwood sandwich, a
gargantuan, multi-layered concoction of cold cuts and condiments, became part
of the country's lexicon as well as a staple of real-life menus.;   Wage and
salary slaves everywhere identified with Dagwood's chronic difficulty waking
on weekdays and catching the bus to work on time. Dagwood racing out of the
house is one of the strip's most enduring gags.;   Millions of readers all
over the world became familiar with J.C. and Cora Dithers, Herb and Tootsie
Woodley, Mr. Beasley, Daisy and her pups. Everyone also got to know Alexander,
born in 1934, and Cookie, who arrived seven years later.;   After all, time's
passage, in the World of Comics, tends to be glacial.;   Blondie and Dagwood
essentially look the way they did in the '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s.
After making it into their teens, their children have likewise been holding
fast chronologically and appear destined to dwell in the dubious immortality
of endless adolescence.;   In their early days, the strip was celebrated in
books, radio programs and a series of 28 movies in the '30s and '40s (and the
last in 1950) that starred Arthur Lake and Penny Singleton.;   Dean Young
joined his father as an assistant in 1962 and took over the strip when his
father died in 1973. In the first two years after his father's death, Dean had
to overcome cancellation of the strip by 500 papers. Gradually he matched and
eventually exceeded Chic's totals.;   Today Young shares billing with
collaborator Stan Drake, who lives in Westport, Conn.;   "I send him the
scripts and ideas I have, and he draws them in pencil and faxes them to me,"
says Young. "Then we go over the strips on the phone. If I can spark up the
gags, I will.";   Young believes a key ingredient of his success is the
avoidance of controversy, a standard inaugurated by his father.;   In his
"Advice to Aspiring Cartoonists," Dean Young wrote:;   "Politics, religion and
racial subjects should be avoided for obvious reasons. The comic strip is a
medium that goes right into the home and its contents should be of the most
wholesome nature.";   That screaming you hear may be Garry Trudeau, the guy
who does "Doonesbury.";   No unpleasant subjects; "Reference to liquor should
be avoided," Young continued. "The characters in Blondie do not smoke.
Divorce, infirmities of the body, sickness and other such unpleasant subjects
do not lend themselves to satisfactory humor for comic strips and should not
be used.";   "I'm not a sociologist, I'm a cartoonist," Young says. "I do what
will help me and what will be fun for my readers.;   "It may not be
controversial, but I think Blondie mirrors contemporary society. For example,
Dagwood doesn't go to work on the bus anymore. He takes a car pool with two
other guys and a female attorney.;   "I'm having great fun with the car pool.
Maybe that's what made me put Blondie to work."  </TEXT>
