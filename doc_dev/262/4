Jim Davis, creator of fat cat Garfield, has been named Cartoonist of the Year 
for 1990 by the National Cartoonists Society. 
</P>
<P>
After six years as a nominee, Davis of Albany, Ind., won the Reuben -- the 
cartoon world's equivalent of the Oscar -- for the cynical, overfed Garfield, 
featured on television specials and many novelty items as well as newspaper 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
The award was presented aboard the MS Sunward II in the Caribbean during the 
weekend, said Selma Gore, spokeswoman for Norwegian Cruise Lines. 
</P>
<P>
The award, a 16-inch bronze statue designed by the late cartoonist Rube 
Goldberg, founder of the 44-year-old society, shows eight people tangled 
together around an inkstand. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for excellence were also given in five categories. Johnny Hart of 
Endicott, N.Y., who draws "B.C." and "Wizard of Id," was honored for best 
newspaper strips and panels. The newspaper editorial and sports award went to 
Pat Oliphant of Falls Church, Va.

"Mad Magazine" cartoonist Sergio Aragones of Ojai, Calif., won the society's 
magazine and book award. Chuck Jones of Laguna Beach won the electronic media 
award for his work on Bugs Bunny and other animated cartoons, and Roy Doty of 
New York City was honored in the commercial category for his advertisements.

comic strips, is president of the 450-member organization.
