   Good grief! Charlie Brown is 40 years old?
   Yep. Charlie and the rest of the ``Peanuts'' gang hit the Big
Four-O, a midlife plateau that usually sets off a good deal of
soul-searching in most folks.
   Just don't expect to see it mentioned in the award-winning strip.
   ``A comic strip should not make self-conscious statements,''
says Charles Schulz, 67, creator of the ``Peanuts'' characters who
appear in more than 2,000 newspapers in 68 nations. ``There will be
nothing in the strip.''
   But that hardly means the milestone will pass unnoticed. An
exhibition is slated for the Louvre in Paris, and half time at the
Super Bowl next January will feature a birthday extravaganza.
   Most importantly, the story of Charlie, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus and
friends can finally be told. The whole truth comes out in the shy
cartoonist's biography, ``Good Grief: The Story of Charles M.
Schulz.'' It's due out October 12 from Pharos Books ($17.95).
   The book, by Rheta Grimsley Johnson, is a first, says Phyllis
Henrici of Pharos, a sister company of the Scripps Howard newspaper
chain. Schulz draws for the United Features Syndicate, a Scripps
Howard subsidiary.
   ``Publishers have wanted to do a biography of him for years, but
he hasn't wanted to authorize one,'' she said.
   What made the difference this time?
   ``I liked her right away,'' Schulz said of Johnson, a columnist
for the Memphis Commercial Appeal.
   Good thing, too. There's no apprentice or designated cartoonist
working for Schulz who can tell the tale some day.
   ``When I retire that's the end of the strip,'' said Schulz.
``It's in my contract.'' Also in his contract is the clause, ``was
mainly my children's idea,'' said Schulz, a father of five. ``They
didn't want anyone but dad drawing it.''
   It is a strip that's become a household name, and one that's
brought Schulz international fame. He won the Rueben Award, comic
arts highest honor, in 1955 and 1964. In 1978, he was named
International Cartoonist of the Year, an award voted by 700 comic
artists around world.
   The CBS Special ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' won a Peabody
award in 1966.
   Charlie Brown, the round-headed kid who seems to court bad luck,
was named after a friend at art school and is Schulz's alter ego.
Snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as child. The other characters
all have distinct personalities and eccentricities.
   Somehow the strip wouldn't be the same if Charlie actually
kicked the football _ or Lucy didn't yank it away.
   Schulz studied art when he was in high school, after he saw a
``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
   ``The truth is, I wasn't a very good student,'' he said.
   His first professional job was doing lettering for drawings in
Timeless Topix, a Catholic comic book. He later taught at the Art
Instruction School, and sold cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post.
   His cartoon feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' which was the start of
Peanuts, was developed for St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. The
strip was sold to a syndicate in 1950, and the name changed to
``Peanuts.''
   The artist, whose income for 1987-88 was estimated by Forbes at
$62 million, is almost a natural resource in the wine country city
of Santa Rosa, about 80 miles north of San Francisco.
   He spends much of his time at his Redwood Empire Ice Arena,
where he frequently plays hockey or sips coffee at the rink's Warm
Puppy snack bar.
   The actual drawing of the strip takes place in his office at One
Snoopy Place, a single-story, stone-and-redwood building. It's
appropriate that the little beagle's monicker got the nod for the
office. It was the Snoopy and Red Baron episodes that really put
the strip into orbit.
   Snoopy, until then just another pet pooch, became a World War I
flying ace in October 1965 and piloted the strip to its pinnacle.
   ``It worked beautifully, so beautifully that nothing can be
expected to duplicate it,'' Johnson recounts.
   Although the book contains stories about all the strip's
characters, the most interesting is about a character never shown _
the ``little red-haired girl'' who is Charlie Brown's unrequited
love.
   ``Peanuts'' began syndication on Oct. 2, 1950, 19 days after
Schulz' proposal of marriage was turned down in his native St.
Paul, Minn., by Donna Mae Wold, the original red-haired girl.
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said Schulz, who proposed five years
after plowing across France in a half-track as an infantryman
during World War II. ``It's something you never get over, but I
think the only purpose in recounting the story was to show how
experience prompts a cartoonist's ideas.''
   Johnson, whose book discloses that the artist suffers from
depression, says Schulz' life contains many rejections he
translated to the strip.
   ``Rejection is his specialty. Losing his hobby. He has spent a
lifetime perfecting failure,'' she said.
   At first Johnson thought the artist was kidding about Wold's
turning him down. ``He talked about it as if it took place last
year,'' she said in an interview.
   Along with depression, the artist also has bouts of agoraphobia,
the fear of being alone in public places from which escape might be
difficult.
   ``The sight of a hotel lobby, for example, puts Schulz in a
sweat,'' writes Johnson.
   Such fears and troubles are too bad, says the author. Yet, there
would not be Schulz' ``unique gift to the world without the
sensitivity that so limits his personal life.''
   And what does ``Peanuts'' mean to Schulz?
   ``This is my whole life,'' he said. ``I pour my heart into this,
every day, and some people don't even read the comics.''
