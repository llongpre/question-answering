   "He can just barely growl," the primitive lettering in the cartoon explains. 
"Bound so tightly with tension and anger, he approaches the state of rigor mortis." 

   Of course, it could be that the hero of "The Angriest Dog in the World," a comic strip drawn by the film director David Lynch, is merely getting bored. 
The four-panel cartoon, which appears regularly in the Los Angeles Reader, an alternative weekly here, has remained virtually unchanged since 1983. 
Week in and week out, the scrappy mutt bares his pointy teeth as he strains against the same leash in front of the same house, with the same smokestacks belching fumes in the distance. 

   The only variation comes in the dialogue that floats from the house's window. 
Mr. Lynch delivers this by telephone, and a production artist at the paper writes it on a copy of the original strip. 
The director's favorite: "Like sand through an hourglass, so are the days of our lives." 

   Mr. Lynch, whose movie credits include "Eraserhead," "Dune" and the recent "Blue Velvet," says he wants to show how "anger builds up because of what we hear and see and have no control over." 

   While "The Dog" has enough loyal followers for a fan club, its message is apparently lost on many readers, who have made the strip one of the most common topics of discussion in letters to the paper. 
One complained that it's "about as funny as a paper bag." 
Even David Hawley, the Reader's general manager, admits he doesn't get it "three out of four times." 

   Reaction among cartoonists is likewise divided, although all agree that Mr. Lynch has made history by creating the first continuing comic strip with unchanging art. 
Jeff Murray, the creator of "USA Toady" and "Face It," took Mr. Lynch to task in a 1985 parody entitled "The Laziest Cartoonist in the World by Aphid Lunch." 
It depicted the dog asleep at an easel. 
"Just barely able to write a bit of predictable dialogue," the copy read, "he approaches a state of utter stasis." 

   But Lynda Barry, the creator of Ernie Pook's Comeek, speaks of Mr. Lynch as if he were the James Joyce of cartooning: "He's making an art form of dialogue." 

   Over the years, three other alternative papers have run the strip. 
All but Baltimore's City Paper, where "the dog is on vacation," have since dropped it entirely. 
At the Reader, however, its future is safe. 
Says Mr. Hawley, "We're going to keep the dog alive and in Alpo for a long time."
