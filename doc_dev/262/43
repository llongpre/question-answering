<LEADPARA>  More than a dozen newspapers have canceled the "Calvin and Hobbes" cartoon
strip to protest its author's requirement that it take up a larger part of the
Sunday comics page, its distributor said.;   About 70 editors have complained
to Universal Press Syndicate, but the strip's subscriptions continue to grow
overall, said Lee Salem, editorial director of the Kansas City-based company
that distributes the cartoon.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Dick King, assistant to the executive editor of the Topeka (Kan.)
Capital-Journal, said the paper expects complaints because it is canceling the
strip.;   "We figured that if we had to put up 'Calvin and Hobbes' on a
half-page, we would have to eliminate something else," King said.;   The comic
strip tells of the adventures of an imaginative boy and his stuffed tiger and
runs in more than 1,800 publications, including the Mercury News.;   "At this
point, the Mercury News doesn't plan to run a full half page of Calvin and
Hobbes and is considering other options," said Ann Hurst, deputy managing
editor in charge of features and business.;   Cartoonist Bill Watterson said
in a letter to editors: "I couldn't draw the strip the way I wanted it to look
(using the smaller format), and I was beginning to wonder why I was publishing
my work in newspapers.";   Salem said the larger format will involve only the
Sunday cartoons and is set to begin Feb. 2, when Watterson returns from a
sabbatical. The strip has been appearing in reruns.  </TEXT>
