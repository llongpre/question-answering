   Singer-guitarist Gregg Allman says he is at
peace these days with a new wife and a new band.
   Allman, 42, on the road with a new Allman Brothers Band, said
his trouble with drugs and his brief stormy marriage to Cher are
definitely behind him.
   ``My health and my peace of mind are good,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I'm very happily married _ I got married last October
_ and my wife Danielle and I are making a new life together.''
   Allman's band, minus two founding members who died, have a new
album, ``Seven Turns,'' scheduled for release Tuesday. Allman and
other surviving founders of the band known for such hits as
``Ramblin' Man'' and ``Statehouse Blues'' regrouped last year.
   ``Music in the '80s got kind of strange,'' said Allman, a former
Macon resident. ``There were electronic drums, synthesizers, heavy
metal, punk _ stuff like that. But then these classic rock stations
started really catching on and we decided maybe it was time to try
it again.''
   The band is scheduled to play in Savannah tonight.

   Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
paid a surprise visit on some TV executives and ran into anchorman
Dan Rather.
   The former Reagan cabinet member showed up Friday at a
convention of CBS affiliates. Rather joined him on stage for a
dialogue about the Soviet Union's troubles and their effect on
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``I think Gorbachev is one of the most talented people I've ever
run into,'' Shultz said. ``He's got a lot on the ball.''
   Asked what action the United States should take in dealing with
the Soviet Union, Shultz replied: ``I think it is in our best
interests to negotiate reductions in armaments as quickly'' as the
Soviets will allow.

   The school that once expelled novelist
Cathie Pelletier for ``radicalism'' is ready to salute her tonight
as an outstanding alumna.
   Ms. Pelletier, whose rollicking accounts of life in the
fictitious Maine town of Mattagash have won her critical acclaim,
said she is gratified by the honor from the University of Maine at
Fort Kent.
   She says reports of her radicalism more than 20 years ago were
exaggerated.
   ``You have to realize how easy it was to be called a radical in
Fort Kent, Maine, in 1969,'' she said. ``A group of students ...
asked me about it once and I said you probably do it at lunch now _
don't worry about it.''
   Her transgressions included referring to the university
president's secretary as Ho Chi Minh, protesting the Vietnam War
and breaking a 9 p.m. curfew. She also pulled a fire alarm at a
dormitory.
   By the spring of Ms. Pelletier's freshman year, the university
president told her she was no longer welcome on campus.
   The author of the 1986 novel ``The Funeral Makers'' returned to
the university and earned a degree in 1976.

   Reputed mob boss John Gotti has a new grandson,
a newspaper says.
   An 8-pound, 1-ounce boy was born to John Gotti Jr. and his bride
of three months, the former Kim Albanese, the New York Post
reported Friday.
   The newest Gotti was born Thursday at Mercy Hospital in
Rockville Centre on Long Island, the newspaper said.
   ``There's no information I can give on a patient by that name,''
hospital spokeswoman Carol Parker told The Associated Press on
Friday.
   The Post said that the baby's father and grandfather, reputed
Gambino family mob boss John Gotti, arrived at the hospital with
two bodyguards in a black Lincoln Continental. The Post said they
entered the hospital through an emergency entrance and headed
straight to the maternity ward, which had been cleared out by more
security guards.

   Cartoonist Jim Davis, beaming like his
famous fat cat Garfield, collected Indiana's fifth annual Hoosier
Pride Award.
   The award, bestowed Friday by Gov. Evan Bayh and Mayor William
Hudnut, honors Davis as an outstanding role model. Previous
recipients have included NBA star Larry Bird.
   Davis, who grew up on a farm near Fairmount with 25 cats,
credited his homespun Hoosier upbringing for much of his success.
   ``I'm one of the people who can honestly say I owe a great deal
of my success to being raised in Indiana,'' Davis said. ``And it
doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that Garfield is a good
ol' cornfield-raised cat.''
   Davis, 44, also draws the barnyard characters in the comic strip
``U.S. Acres.'' He has won four Emmy Awards for the Saturday
morning TV show ``Garfield the Cat.''
