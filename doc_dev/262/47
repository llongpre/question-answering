   An elevator that goes through the roof and into
outer space? Colonies orbiting Earth? A giant hook that swings from
the sky and scoops goods and passengers into space?
   Impossible!
   Then again ...
   Sixty years ago, men walking on the moon, lie detectors and
instant cameras sounded equally implausible to most people.
   The 1929 predictions, and many more like them, were made in the
comic strip ``Buck Rogers,'' set in the year 2429. On Monday, the
grandchildren of one of the cartoon's creators gathered to make new
predictions on what would have been Buck's 60th anniversary.
   ``In 1929, when they came out with the numerous predictions in
Buck Rogers, they thought they were 500 years in the future. And
(much of it) came true within a century,'' said Flint Dille,
grandson of John Flint Dille, who died in 1957.
   Dille and his sister, Lorraine Williams, plan to bring back the
strip as well as release a series of books and possibly a movie.
   But first, they said, they must revamp the future since much of
their grandfather's future has already become reality.
   So, like their grandfather, the pair assembled a team including
scientists and artists to create a world in which to set the
stories. They talked about the future at the Henry Crown Space
Center of the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.
   They devised the space elevator, which is a tube that rises from
Earth into the outer atmosphere; the sky hook, which would scoop
cargo into space; an environmental suit that would adapt itself to
any atmosphere; and energy guns that would replace pistols.
   ``It's a classic adventure set in the plausible future,'' Dille
said. ``This is all a logical extension of what we have now. ...
Everything in the story has to be something that with present
theories of science could be done.''
   In 1929, John Flint Dille, president of the National News
Syndicate, created the strip with artist Dick Calkins and writer
Philip Nowlan. The three, with a team of experts, developed an image
of the future, including rockets and nuclear energy.
   The comic strip was canceled in 1967, a victim of the present
catching up with the future. The future looked gloomy, Ms. Williams
said, with the possibility of nuclear destruction and global war.
   But since then, young people are more interested in the future
and are not intimidated by the possibilities, she said.
   That makes 1989 the right time to bring Buck Rogers into the 25th
century, though such plans are only in their nascent stages, she
said.
   ``The future now is positive and it's exciting,'' Ms. Williams
said. ``And that's why Buck will be successful.''
