   Cartoonists have become the conscience of Hong
Kong as they acidly etch the desperation felt by a people destined
to live under the flag of Communist China in seven years.
   With politicians bickering and editorial writers anxious not to
irritate the leaders in Beijing, comic strips have become one of
the few platforms where Hong Kong's fears are expressed with often
brutal clarity.
   Just after the crackdown June 4 in Beijing on the democracy
movement, cartoonist Juan Tze drew Premier Li Peng in a bathtub of
blood.
   ``Is it hot enough?'' asked a soldier holding a bucket of
steaming ``people's blood.''
   After Sir Geoffrey Howe, then the British foreign secretary,
told Hong Kong that Britain could not guarantee the territory's
future, Larry Feign, an American expatriate, summed up the feelings
of many.
   ``I don't know who to hate more, Deng Xiaoping or Margaret
Thatcher,'' says one of his comic strip characters.
   After 149 years of British rule, Hong Kong returns to China in
1997. Although Beijing has promised to retain the territory's
free-wheeling economic and social system for 50 years, many of Hong
Kong's 5.7 million people lost faith in that promise after the June
4 crackdown.
   Many also have little confidence in faction-ridden local
politicians, says Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a leading educator and writer
in the colony. Newspapers also practice self-censorship in their
criticism of Beijing, he said.
   ``People look to comic strips as an outlet for their
frustrations,'' Cheng said. ``Their popularity demonstrates that we
have a solid groundswell of anti-communist, anti-China feeling,
especially after June 4.''
   Adds Feign: ``Cartoons appeal to the Chinese because you can get
your meaning across indirectly.''
   Cheng said that only in the last few years have comic strips
become an important political outlet in Hong Kong. A recent
exhibition of cartoons at the Hong Kong Arts Centre drew 40,000
people over several weeks.
   Feign and Juan are perhaps the two best known cartoonists in the
colony.
   Frenetic and balding, Feign, 34, is author of a comic strip for
the English-language South China Morning Post called ``The World of
Lily Wong.''
   For the five years since he moved to Hong Kong from Orange
County in California with his Chinese wife, Feign has charted the
lives of Lily, a smart, sexy Hong Kong woman, and Stuart Wright, a
bumbling but good-hearted American.
   Stuart wants to marry Lily and give her the passport she covets
but Lily isn't in love and so far has refused him. Through their
relationship, Feign explores the often blatant racism inflicted on
Chinese by Westerners. He also pokes fun at the ways Chinese view
Westerners, known as ``devils'' in Cantonese.
   A tall man, with the comportment of a Mandarin official in old
China's imperial court, Juan is more self-consciously political
than Feign.
   He grew up during Hong Kong's most turbulent times and remembers
watching the bloody anti-British riots in 1967 from a rickety
balcony on his tenement home. He began drawing comics as an art
student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in the 1970s.
   He took a page from early 20th century Chinese history, during
which cartoons were a popular form of political agitation, and
decided to use comics to fight for Hong Kong's common man. He went
to work at the Chinese-language Ming Pao.
   ``My generation is different from my parents','' said Juan, now
33. ``They came from China and are concerned with basic things like
food and money. We are searching for other things, from the
spirit.''
   When China recently announced its opposition to a British plan
to give passports to key Hong Kong professionals and officials,
Juan drew a man sitting on his bed, his birth certificate, identity
card and passport scattered beneath him. ``Who am I? Who am I?''
the man screamed as his wife snored beside him.
   ``We have an identity crisis in Hong Kong,'' Juan said. ``London
and Beijing are deciding our fate and we can't influence them. I
wanted to describe our feeling of hopelessness.''
   Following the crackdown in Beijing, Juan drew Chinese Premier Li
Peng explaining why tanks were used to put down the rebellion. ``We
ran out of cars,'' Li tells a visitor.
   Another strip shows an Englishman offering Hong Kong on a fork
into the drooling mouth of a corrupt Chinese cadre. ``Be a brave
Chinaman,'' the Englishman says.
   Juan, who hopes to stay in Hong Kong after 1997, has recently
published a book of his work, ``Black Goods.''
   ``I guess the Chinese might call me a counterrevolutionary,'' he
said with a wry smile. ``I'm just helping them gather proof.''
   If Juan expresses the desperation of Hong Kong, Feign captures
the absurdity of its life.
   Living on the cusp of two worlds _ Hong Kong Chinese and Western
expatriate _ Feign has a unique vantage point.
   ``In the beginning, my position gave me a chance to pull off a
lot of good gags,'' said Feign. ``But now as things get serious I
find it harder to draw. It's becoming a tragedy.''
