<HEAD>Newspaper Pulls Comic Strip Aimed At RJR</HEAD>

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The hometown newspaper of R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. has pulled a comic strip in which a Reynolds
applicant has trouble saying, ``Cigarettes do not cause cancer''
without laughing.
   A one-paragraph statement on The Winston-Salem Journal's Sunday
editorial page said editors pulled the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip
because they ``felt it singled out for an unfair attack the city's
largest company and would be personally offensive to its employees,
their families and a large number of the Journal's readers.''
   Spokesmen for Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes
Doonesbury to 900 newspapers worldwide, said it was the first time
Garry Trudeau's controversial comic strip has been pulled from a
newspaper ``in deference to a corporation.''
   ``It certainly won't be the last time,'' said Lee Salem,
Universal Press's editorial director.
   The comic strip came on the heels of last month's takeover of the
food and tobacco giant by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for $24.53
billion, the largest corporate buyout in U.S. history.
   More than 40 Journal reporters and editors sent a memo to
Publisher Joe Doster protesting the withdrawal of the comic strip.
And four people called John Gates, editorial page editor, to
complain.
   ``Virtually to a person, they said they felt they were old enough
to determine whether something was offensive for themselves, and I
have long since given up trying to make the distinction between
censorship and editorial judgment to these people,'' Gates said.
   Doster, who made the final decision, was not available for
comment this morning, his secretary said.
   Gates said Sunday's ``Doonesbury'' was ``hilariously funny.'' But
he added that the comic strip's ``timing was bad,'' coming on the
heels of last month's buyout of RJR-Nabisco Inc., R.J. Reynolds's
corporate parent.
   ``It was sort of like kicking somebody when he was down,'' Gates
said.
   But Salem said: ``When else would one talk about R.J. Reynolds,
except when it's in the news?''
   Maura Payne, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds in Winston-Salem,
said the comic strip ``misrepresents the company's position on the
subject of smoking and health, and does a disservice to our
employees.''
   Executives of Reynolds and other cigarette companies, when they
address what they call ``the smoking and health controversy,'' say
the link between smoking and disease in humans has not been
scientifically proven.
   Reynolds spokeswoman Betsy Annese said the company considered the
strip ``a terrible affront to the honest, hard-working employees''
of RJR. The Journal's decision to pull the strip was ``a nice
gesture,'' she said.
   Over the years, newspapers across the country have pulled
``Doonesbury'' when it poked fun at various public figures,
including President Reagan, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Sen.
John Warner of Virginia and entertainer Frank Sinatra. Newspapers
also have withdrawn the strip because of statements about the
Vietnam War and other controversial issues.
