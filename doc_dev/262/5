   Jim Davis, creator of fat cat ``Garfield,'' has
been named Cartoonist of the Year for 1990 by the National
Cartoonists Society.
   After six years as a nominee, Davis, of Albany, Ind., won the
``Reuben'' _ the cartoon world's equivalent of the Oscar _ for the
cynical, overfed Garfield, featured on television specials and many
novelty items as well as newspaper cartoons.
   The award was presented aboard the MS Sunward II in the
Caribbean during the weekend, said Selma Gore, spokeswoman for
Norwegian Cruise Lines.
   The award, a 16-inch bronze statue designed by the late
cartoonist Rube Goldberg, founder of the 44-year-old society, shows
eight people tangled together around an inkstand.
   Awards for excellence also were given in five categories. Johnny
Hart of Endicott, N.Y., who draws ``B.C.'' and ``Wizard of Id,''
was honored for best newspaper strips and panels. The newspaper
editorial and sports award went to Pat Oliphant of Falls Church, Va.
   ``Mad Magazine'' cartoonist Sergio Aragones, of Ojai, Calif.,
won the society's magazine and book award. Chuck Jones of Laguna
Beach, Calif., won the electronic media award for his work on Bugs
Bunny and other animated cartoons, and Roy Doty of New York City
was honored in the commercial category for his advertisements.
   Mell Lazarus, creator of the nationally syndicated ``Miss
Peach'' and ``Momma'' comic strips, is president of the 450-member
organization.
