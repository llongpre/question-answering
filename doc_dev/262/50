   Dick Tracy has a gang of funny-faced bad guys on
the run in movie theaters and Bart Simpson rules television
airwaves and T-shirt sales, but the summer belongs to Spider-Man
for comic book fans.
   Less than two weeks after its release in June, the first issue
of a new Marvel Comics series, titled simply ``Spider-Man,'' became
the best-selling comic in U.S. history.
   And the wisecracking web-slinger snared ``favorite character''
honors in the annual Comics Buyer's Guide readers poll. The
wall-crawler defeated Batman, last summer's box-office sensation
and titleholder since 1985.
   Spidey's success has Hollywood sniffing around for a movie deal.
   ``When it comes right down to it, I can be pretty awesome if I
want,'' Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, says in an
introspective moment in the first comic in the new series,
``Spider-Man No. 1.''
   He debuted in 1962 as an unpopular teen-ager whose life changed
when he was bitten by a radioactive spider. Today, he's a graduate
student in biophysics who shares a New York loft with his glamorous
actress-model wife.
   ``He's changing with the times, but still contains a lot of the
stuff that attracted (people) to the character in the first
place,'' says Spider-Man's editor, Jim Salicrup.
   Canadian cartoon artist Todd McFarlane, 29, gets much of the
credit for the new comic book series' success. Previously, he drew
for ``Amazing Spider-Man,'' the title of the original comic book
series. In 1988, he redesigned the costume to add a ``creepier''
feel.
   The new series' first run of 2.35 million copies sold out, so
Marvel is printing another 400,000, said Pamela Rutt, a spokeswoman
for the country's largest comic book publisher.
   By comparison, ``Legends of the Dark Knight,'' a Batman book
introduced at the height of last year's Batmania, sold an estimated
800,000 copies to become 1989's top seller.
   Spider-Man continues to draw new generations into his web and
Stan Lee, the writer who created him with artist Steve Ditko, says
he's not surprised.
   ``They like Spider-Man because they can relate to him,'' Lee
said. ``He has all the problems that they themselves, the readers,
can empathize with.''
   Over the years, Spider-Man starred on television and was
featured on several record albums.
   Lee, now publisher at Marvel and writer of the Spider-Man
newspaper comic strip, is trying to bring Spider-Man to the big
screen.
   ``We're negotiating now,'' he said. ``If we're lucky, it might
reach the theaters by the end of next year.''
