Cartoonist Jim Unger is taking a two-month leave of absence from his popular 
comic strip "Herman" for health reasons. During Unger's hiatus, the Universal 
Press Syndicate will distribute "classic releases of the panel in both its 
daily and Sunday formats," starting Monday. A one-panel strip with no recurring 
characters that depicts a skewed world of dumpy people, whiny little kids and 
obnoxious pets, "Herman" has twice been named "Best Panel Comic Strip" by the 
National Cartoonists' Society. "Herman" debuted in 1974 and currently appears 
in 400 newspapers in 24 countries, including the Los Angeles Times. ALEENE
