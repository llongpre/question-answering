   Cartoonist Milton Caniff, creator of the
Steve Canyon and Terry and the Pirates comic strips, has begun
chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer in New York City.
   Caniff was in the mood to talk Monday in a telephone interview
from Beth Israel hospital.
   ``First thing this morning I reached for the old drawing board
but it wasn't even there,'' Caniff told the Dayton Daily News.
   Caniff, who learned about the cancer Friday, thinks it will be
at least a month before he is able to draw Steve Canyon again. He
said he doesn't know how long he will be in the hospital.
   ``This cancer thing has kind of stopped me in my tracks for a
bit, so right now I'm just taking it one day at a time,'' he said.
   Caniff said he has about 30 days worth of the Canyon strip
finished. If he's unable to work when those are gone, his
assistant, Richard Rockwell, and others will keep the storyline
running.
   Caniff, who grew up in Dayton, has been producing a daily comic
strip for 54 years and had planned to continue drawing in the
hospital.
   ``But when it came right down to it, I didn't feel like it,''
the 81-year-old artist said.
   Even so, he said, his spirits are high.
   ``I'm just naturally ornery, anyway, but when this happened, I
had to decide what I was going to do,'' he said. ``I could be an
old curmudgeon or I could make life easier for my family, friends
and the medical staff here. I decided on the latter approach.''
