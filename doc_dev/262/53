   Capt. Dick Tracy of the Chicago Police
Department loved the movie. But he couldn't solve the crime.
   ``I suspected somebody else,'' said Tracy after watching the
movie ``Dick Tracy.'' Judging from the gasps from the audience,
very few people suspected the culprit.
   Tracy _ yes, that's really his name _ was among 500 guests at a
preview of the movie here Wednesday night. Woodstock was the home
of Chester Gould, who created the Dick Tracy comic strip. The movie
opens nationally Friday.
   ``It was great,'' said Tracy, who at 56 is just two years
younger than the comic strip. ``It had an interesting plot, lots of
action, the scenes were uniquely done.''
   Others agreed.
   ``It was fabulous,'' said Woodstock resident Betty Hamilton. ``I
was never a Dick Tracy fan, but now I am. I'm going to go back and
read all the comic books.''
   ``The cinematography is phenomenal and Madonna is great,'' said
Bob Billimack, a real estate broker from Woodstock.
   Guests paid $100 each for seats at the Woodstock Opera House.
Proceeds will benefit the Chester Gould Memorial Library, a museum
planned to commemorate the late cartoonist and his famous
characters like 88 Keys, Mumbles, Breathless and Pruneface.
   Black-haired, steely-eyed Dick Tracy first appeared during the
Depression, the first comic strip to deviate from the ``funnies''
approach and venture into graphic violence.
   Gould created _ and knocked off _ enough bad guys and really bad
guys for Woodstock and the whole country.
   ``I told myself, `I'm gonna draw a guy that shoots them,'''
Gould said before his death at age 84 in 1985. ``It was kind of
nice to have a cop who would shoot first and ask questions later.''
   There's plenty of shooting in this fast-paced, rock 'em sock 'em
Walt Disney movie, but it's not graphic enough to jeopardize the PG
rating. On the other hand, Madonna, playing the sultry speakeasy
singer Breathless, has some racy scenes that probably wouldn't make
the comic pages of a family newspaper.
   Capt. Tracy, a 34-year veteran officer, said the ``flirtatious''
scenes were important.
   ``The fact that Dick Tracy didn't succumb to that is part of the
movie. Warren Beatty played the role the way we would like to
imagine police were in that time. At least Dick Tracy wasn't
wearing an earring,'' Tracy said, alluding to two Peotone, Ill.,
police officers disciplined recently.
   ``Besides, Madonna was in town and unfortunately, she didn't
crawl around on my desk like that,'' Tracy said, laughing.
   The movie culminated a week of Dick Tracy Days in this town 50
miles northwest of Chicago.
   Disney officials were adamant that the real premiere, with
stars, 3,000 invited journalists and all, is today at Florida's
Walt Disney World.
   But Woodstock Mayor Jim Shoemaker said that showing won't be the
same. ``You'll see brighter red carpet, bigger celebrities, fancier
limousines,'' he told Jean O'Connell, Gould's daughter, who planned
to travel to Orlando for the premiere.
   ``The one thing that Orlando's not going to have is 14,000
people who loved your dad. Dick Tracy, you're finally home,''
Shoemaker said, his voice choking with emotion.
