   The fevered pitch of Wall Street's bidding for
giant food companies could go even higher following a buyout
specialist's record $20.28 billion offer for RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. made its $90-a-share leveraged
buyout offer for RJR Nabisco on Monday, four days after Nabisco's
management said it might offer $17 billion, or $75 a share, to buy
the company from stockholders.
   ``Our offer is a better one,'' said Henry Kravis, a partner in
the New York-based investment firm.
   Securities analysts said the Kohlberg Kravis tender offer was
more in line with Nabisco's worth than the proposal broached by
management, and say that higher offers may still emerge.

   The Soviet Union is seeking agreement to use a
Philippines ship repair yard, raising U.S. concerns about potential
eavesdropping on the strategic American naval base at Subic Bay,
according to government officials.
   The officials said the administration opposes any such
arrangement on grounds that it would give the Soviets close access
to Subic, which is perhaps the most important American military
installation outside the United States.
   The Philippines has rejected previous Soviet requests for ship
repair at the Philseco yard but Moscow recently renewed the
request. The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said there are
inconclusive indications the Philippines may approve the new
request.
   One reason Filipino authorities may change their mind, the
officials said, is that the repair yard is losing money. The
enterprise is a joint venture of Philippine and Japanese interests.

   Two trapped whales reversed course and
headed back toward shore, frustrating efforts to coax them toward
open water, as scientists probed an ice ridge for a weak spot that
Soviet icebreakers could attack.
   ``It's discouraging,'' federal biologist David Withrow said
Monday as the mammals, apparently spooked by a shoal that has
stymied progress for three days, retreated about 800 yards. ``Why
come back here when they know it's open up there?''
   The California gray whales struggled up for air, tiring quickly
as they poked their way through large slabs of Beaufort Sea ice and
thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom.
   At one point, the 27-foot-long whale _ the smaller of the two _
rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice. Blood
oozed from a raw spot on its snout, smearing the ice and staining
the water.

   Eastern Airlines demanded that the Customs Service
release a $14 million jetliner impounded after agents found 56
pounds of cocaine aboard, saying it is an ally, not an enemy, in
the war against drugs.
   Monday's discovery of a bag of cocaine aboard an L-1011 a day
after it arrived here from Bogota, Colombia, was the fourth drug
confiscation involving an Eastern flight since August.
   The Customs Service said the plane would not be released until
Eastern pays a fine of $896,000 _ or $1,000 an ounce _ and pledges
to improve drug security.
   Eastern executives, who are appealing $13 million in fines from
the three earlier seizures, said they found the latest action
difficult to understand.

   The mercy mission of six former Marines to clear
mines in Vietnam is an exchange of good will that the Vietnamese
hope will blossom into diplomatic recognition, an infusion of aid
and the lifting of a trade embargo.
   Three of the Americans who are going on the Jan. 9 mission, Gene
T. Spanos, of Rosemont, Ill.; Robert Dalton, of Davidsonville, Md.;
and Frank Noe, of Stoughton, Mass., were at the Vietnamese mission
to the United Nations on Monday.
   They met with Ambassador Trinh Xuan Lang, head of the Vietnamese
mission, and reviewed their planned nine-day trip to former
battlefields below the Demilitarized Zone, including Khe Sanh where
Marines withstood a 77-day siege in 1968.
   Their sentiments were expressed in a plaque presented to Vietnam
with the inscription: ``In the hopes of preserving the peace, we
come to Vietnam once again, this time to help the preservation of
human life. 11th Engineers January 1989.''

   Garfield pined for the comforts of home while outdoors in a
rainstorm, and Marmaduke invited homeless dogs to his house for
breakfast as cartoonists focused on the plight of the needy in
today's comic pages.
   More than 100 comic-strip and editorial cartoonists, including
the creators of ``Garfield'' and ``Marmaduke,'' participated.
   ``The goal of the project is to tug at America's heart strings
through its funny bones. Tomorrow's funny pages are not going to be
so funny,'' Barry Zigas, of the National Low Income Housing
Coalition, said during a news conference Monday in Washington.
   Some of the cartoons had a serious tone. Others found a humorous
tilt to a not-so-funny issue. In ``The Lockhorns'' a suited-man
tells a homeless man cooking over a fire, ``I'd ask you home for a
good home-cooked meal but you're better off here.''

   Frozen corpses of two seamen who died during
a doomed Arctic expedition in 1848 contain bacteria that show
unexpected resistance to antibiotics developed more than 120 years
later, scientists say.
   Because there is evidence that lead poisoning killed the men,
the researchers speculate that heavy metal pollutants, not just
overuse of antibiotics, may play a role in creating disease germs
that survive drugs.
   The proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a
major problem, especially in Third World nations where the drugs
are used indiscriminately, killing vulnerable bacteria and allowing
resistant bacteria to reproduce.
   But medical microbiologist Dr. Kinga Kowalewska-Grochowska said
the study she conducted with colleagues at the University of
Alberta in Edmonton has prompted her to speculate environmental
pollution may spur development of some antibiotic-resistant germs.

   The Club of Rome, best known for its first report
warning of the dangers unlimited growth pose to the planet, is
bringing together thinkers and world leaders this week to celebrate
its 20th anniversary.
   And in addition to fostering discussion on what it calls `a new
global society,'' the club plans internal changes that will for the
first time seek to turn its ideas into action.
   Club members come from 51 countries _ rich and poor, capitalist,
socialist and communist.
   ``I think we are at a turning point in the life of the club
after 20 years,'' Secretary-General Bertrand Schneider said in an
interview in his Paris office.
