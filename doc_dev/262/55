   Nearly a half century has passed since
``Archie'' artist Bob Montana hung out at The Chocolate Shop,
drawing cartoons on napkins and gossiping with classmates who would
later inspire Veronica, Betty and company.
   But those days didn't seem very far away as the Haverhill High
School Class of 1940 met Sunday for the opening of an exhibit on
Archie, recalling their mischievious youth and how it was captured
in the comic strip adventures of freckle-faced Archie Andrews and
his hapless mates Jughead and Moose.
   Montana died in 1975, but the comics continue to be published,
along with a Saturday cartoon show.
   ``Let me tell you a secret. When I left high school I had 300
afternoon sessions to make up,'' said Arnold Daggett, the widely
accepted prototype for Moose. With his snowy white crewcut and
friendly, square-jawed face, the 68-year-old Daggett was
unmistakably the vintage version of hearty, football-playing Moose.
   Daggett said he did not know of his celebrity status until the
exhibit was organized, but he said he recognizes himself in one
strip _ ``where I was getting kicked out of class.''
   Others, such as Charlie Hayden who first saw the comics as a
serviceman abroad, said they recognized landmark statues and the
high school newspaper ``The Brown &amp; Gold.''
   Rita Walker, who lived two streets away from Montana, said she
recognized Haverhill High almost immediately when Archie burst on
the American comic scene in 1941, cheering at football games,
driving high school principal Mr. Weatherbee crazy and hanging out
at The Chok'lit Shop, Montana's spelling of the popular Haverhill
spot.
   ``The Chocolate Shop _ we all knew darn well where the Chocolate
Shop was. He used to go there all the time and draw cartoons on
napkins,'' said Mrs. Walker.
   All the graduates agreed that Daggett is Moose, partly because
of a high school cartoon of Daggett the football star that is very
similar to Moose the comic strip character. But on the other
characters, theories abound.
   Archie experts differ as to whether other Archie characters are
direct caricatures or composites. At the exhibit, excerpts from
Montana's diary were shown that contained many references to his
high school experiences.
   Montana traveled the vaudeville circuit with his parents as a
child and then lived in Boston's theater district. His years in
Haverhill were his first encounter with small-town life, said his
widow, Peggy Bertholet, now remarried.
   ``I think he enjoyed high school so much that he was more the
average American high school student than most high school students
are,'' she said.
   Mrs. Walker described Montana the high school boy as ``a tall,
lanky kid. To me, he appeared to be a shy guy from the outside
looking in and wishing he could be hellions like some of them
were.''
   In the years since his 1941 debut, Archie has swapped his
checked knickers for blue jeans and tackled such up-to-date issues
as dyslexia, but he and his friends haven't lost the concept of
idealized youth, said Brian Walker, exhibit director of the Museum
of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y.
   Archie was the brainchild of John Goldwater, a partner in the
New York publishing company where Montana worked as an artist. From
the beginning, the comics strove for a humorous approach to
real-life issues, said Michael Silberkleit, chairman of the current
Archie Comic Publications Inc., whose father, Louis, was a company
founder.
