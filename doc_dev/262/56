   Tintin, the moon-faced Belgian comic
strip reporter who trots around in knickers in action-packed tales,
has quietly turned 60.
   The intrepid young scribe _ a trademark tuft of hair rising above
the round face with the peg nose and beady eyes _ first appeared
Jan. 29, 1929 in a cartoon strip in a weekly insert for youngsters
in La Vingtieme Siecle, a now defunct Brussels daily.
   The rest is history, or at least years of happy reading and
rereading for comic strip lovers in 30 nations who have devoured the
23 Tintin albums in any of 33 languages.
   He is called Tintin in English, French, Basque, Arabic, Spanish
and Swedish. Others call him Kuifje (Dutch), Tim (German), Tinni
(Icelandic), Tintti (Finnish), Tantan (Hebrew and Japanese) or Ten
Ten (Greek).
   His albums have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, said
Viviane Vandeninden, organizer of ``Herge, Dessinateur'' (Herge,
Cartoonist), a retrospective of the work of Tintin's creator, George
Remy. He signed his work Herge which are his initials in French,
spelled backward.
   The show played at the Ixelles Museum in Brussels through Jan.
15, before moving to the Fine Arts Museum in Angouleme, France (Jan.
26-Feb. 15) and the Hotel de Sens museum in Paris (March 4-May 4).
   Herge died of cancer in 1983 at the age of 76. He raised the
low-key craft of comic strip drawing into an art form.
   His albums are gems of story-telling and drawing. They put Tintin
_ who never aged and only late in life exchanged his puffy pants for
slacks _ into fast-paced tales that took him from the Soviet Union
to Africa, and from the opium dens of the Far East to the
skyscrapers of America.
   He even explored the moon in two strips in the late 1940s whose
drawings remain timeless to this day.
   During his travels, Tintin found a motley collection of friends,
including Thompson and Thomson, two dimwitted, identical twin
detectives, and Archibald Haddock, a sea captain who loves whiskey
and cursing.
   The first album, ``Tintin in the Soviet Union,'' appeared in late
1929. The last strip was ``Tintin and the Picaros'' in 1976.
   The Tintin retrospective has 300 original drawings, sketches,
doodles and entire story boards by Herge whose unique style is known
as ``Ligne Claire'': solid, unbroken lines that make dramatic
perspectives. They have never before been exhibited.
   Tintin's adventures ended with Herge's death. In the 1950s and
'60s, Studio Herge employed about 12 artists, but none was allowed
to complete the 24th album that remains unfinished at page 42.
   ``Herge did not want to put Tintin in the hands of others,''
Vanderinden said. ``That is what makes Tintin unique. It's like
saying that after Beethoven, there cannot be another Beethoven.
There are other composers, but there is only one Beethoven.''
   A quiet, reserved man, Herge's personal life was in marked
contrast to that of Tintin. During his working life, he never
visited the countries to which he dispatched his hero, although
that's hard to tell from his stories: His drawings displayed a
remarkable knowledge of faraway places and customs by simply
perusing illustrated guidebooks and, especially, the National
Geographic Magazine.
   Tintin began his life as a reporter for La Vingtieme Siecle _ the
Catholic daily where Herge began in the circulation department in
1925 _ who is sent to the Soviet Union where the Communist
Revolution continues to rumble.
   In its weekly installments, the comic strip reflected the
virulently anti-communist views of La Vingtieme Siecle. The story
ran until May 8, 1930, without Herge knowing from one week to the
next where the story was going. This is evident from the early story
boards showing Tintin and Snowy, a white terrier who was to be his
life-long companion, taking a train from Brussels to Moscow.
   In the Soviet Union, Tintin ran afoul of unsavory commies who
seek to prevent him from returning home with a terrible secret _
that Russian factories are only flimsy movie-set decors, ersatz
testimony to the workers' paradise.
   ``I was inspired in my choice (of the story) by the atmosphere of
the newspaper,'' Herge said later.
   ``Tintin in the Soviet Union'' was an immediate success, even
though the story and the art work are very stilted compared with
later Herge work.
   When the story ended, Herge hired a young man who looked somewhat
like his comic strip hero, dressed him up in a Russian costume and
red boots and had him arrive by train in Brussels.
   ``I was sure no one would show up,'' Herge recalled later. ``But
to my surprise there was a crowd at the station and people held on
to the car that was to take the Tintin double home.''
   The second Tintin album sent the reporter to the then Belgian
Congo, the third to the United States.
   ``Tintin en Amerique'' (``Tintin in America'') shows the
influence of Hollywood films on Herge. The frames show more action
and suspense. In one, Tintin clings perilously high to an outside
wall of a skycraper.
   Herge long resisted switching to color. But he did so in 1947
with ``L`Etoile Mysterieuse'' (``The Mysterious Star''). By then, he
was working with assistants who developed the backdrop scenes with
Herge always drawing Tintin and the other key characters. At that
time, he redrew some of his early works, such as ``Tintin in the
Soviet Union'' and ``Tintin in the Congo'' toning down their harsh
views on Communism and Africans.
   The Tintin retrospective shows original Herge drawings that have
remained in a safe at the Herge Foundation, which commercializes the
Tintin character and promotes the works of promising young
cartoonists. They include the story boards of a hitherto unknown
Tintin story which is practically finished but which will never see
publication.
   ``It is hard to say how many original works by Herge are still
around,'' Vanderinden said. ``He gave so much away during his life.''
   Herge's death has done wonders for the price of original Herge
drawings which fetch upwards of $100,000, depending on quality.
   But then, Tintin's popularity shows no signs of fading. Only
several years ago, a re-issue of the original ``Tintin in the Soviet
Union'' quickly sold out 100,000 copies within 30 days.
