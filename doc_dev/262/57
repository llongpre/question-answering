<LEADPARA>  The comic strip "Sally Forth" has rarely touched on the controversial.
Basically, it's a low-key strip about a rather politically correct
middle-class family. And so cartoonist Greg Howard wasn't prepared for the
reaction when he hired a professional artist to draw the strip. Readers
couldn't stand the way Craig MacIntosh, the new illustrator, drew "their"
characters and Howard took the complaints to heart. He announced this week
that MacIntosh will continue to draw the strip -- but in Howard's cruder
style.;   Howard, in the Bay Area for a family wedding, visited the Mercury
News on Tuesday and talked about Forth's foibles.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Q: One more time: why did you change the strip's style?;   A: The whole
idea was to improve the artwork and afford me more time to work on the
writing. The constant deadlines in doing it for 10 years, having to come up
with something new and different all the time, was not always easy. So to have
the time to do more reading, to help me generate new ideas -- that was the
motivation.;   And it's not like I was doing anything that unusual. 'Blondie'
is written by Dean Young, but he's never drawn the strip.;   Q: How could you
have handled this episode differently?;   A: What I should have done in
retrospect was to have Craig begin where I left off, to begin with my style
and let it evolve naturally into his style. Because all comic strips evolve.
There's a huge difference between my style now and my style 10 years ago --
huge. Far greater than the difference between my current style and Craig's.;  
My mistake was in making the changes too abruptly. The thing that's
interesting to me is that there were some subtleties in my drawings of which I
wasn't even aware, but the readers made me aware.;   People have written me
about Sally's body configuration and the role it played in the comic strip. My
version of Sally is a little thicker in the waist and her legs go straight
down. In Mac's drawings, Sally's got more of a waist and defined hips and her
legs get smaller as they go down. I've learned from readers that my Sally had
that comfortable lived-in look. And Craig's Sally was more like an 18-year-old
girl. And the difference was important to readers, and I hadn't even realized
it.;   Q: How did you feel when the complaints started rolling in?;   A: I was
depressed about it -- not clinically depressed. I was down. I kind of felt
like the guy who brought out New Coke. Whoops! Bad idea. But as time went on,
I realized what it really meant -- there were a lot of people reading it, a
lot of people who cared. I'm trying to look at it positively.;   Q: Were you
surprised by how strongly people felt?;   A: Yeah, I don't set out to do what
Doonesbury does. Trudeau likes to stir the pot. But that's not my mission. My
mission is to create a strip with a quieter sort of humor, a family-oriented
thing looking at the interrelationships. I don't set out to make controversy,
so I'm a little out of my element here.;   Q: Why are you continuing the
collaboration with MacIntosh? Is it because you have a contract?;   A: We do
have a deal, but we're also friends. So if he wanted out or I wanted out, the
other would accommodate. I think it will still work. I feel badly for him
because he's taken a certain amount of abuse, people writing and saying, 'I
hate the new art work,' when what they mean is, 'I want the old artwork.';  
Q: Describe your limitations as an artist.;   A: I've gotten over the years a
fair amount of criticism from editors about my lack of artistic talent. Not so
much from readers. Readers are more forgiving and some even describe my style
as charming.;   I usually kept the characters in the Forth house or Sally's
office and I rarely took them outside. And if they went out to dinner, I would
have them at home talking about going out to dinner -- little ways of writing
around my inability to draw.;   Q: Were you pressured to go back to the old
style?;   A: Oh, there was some pressure to do it. Sure. But it was my
decision. My editor called me up; he sent me copies of letters they were
getting. Reporters were calling me, about 25 of them. My own newspaper in
Minneapolis, the Star Tribune, had gotten 250 calls last Thursday or Friday
and that was climbing. And the mail hadn't poured in yet, because it was too
early.;   We were just getting so many calls and I just thought we had to do
something. We essentially had to throw away about two months worth of artwork,
which is a tough decision.;   Q: So aren't you now paying MacIntosh to
intentionally draw the strip badly?;   A:  Ironic, isn't it? It's gonna be
interesting to see him take his artistic ability down a few notches and draw
like me.  </TEXT>
