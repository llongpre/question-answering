   Beetle Bailey, the lazy but lovable GI who has
stumbled through comic pages for the past 40 years, finally won an
admiring salute Thursday from the U.S. Army.
   In a Flag Day ceremony at the Pentagon, cartoonist Mort Walker
received a framed ``certificate of appreciation for patriotic
civilian service'' from Brig. Gen. Bill McClain, who declared an
armistice in the Army's decades-old hostilities against the
slovenly buck private.
   ``Through it all, you have entertained us, although sometimes we
haven't always liked it,'' said McClain, the Army's public affairs
chief. He observed: ``If you can't laugh at yourself, something is
intrinsically wrong with you.''
   Tongue in cheek, Walker replied that it was always ``the dream
of Gen. Halftrack and mine to hear from the Pentagon,'' and it took
40 years to get the call.
   ``I can't believe I'm actually here,'' Walker said. ``As hard as
it is to find anything in the Pentagon, they finally found a sense
of humor.''
   Since Walker created the popular comic strip in 1950, based on
his experiences as an Army draftee in World War II, Beetle Bailey
and his cartoon friends have annoyed some Pentagon brass who
complained they presented an unflattering image of Army life.
   In 1954, the Tokyo edition of The Stars and Stripes military
newspaper drummed Beetle off its pages because the strip poked fun
at officers. The official explanation was that ``Beetle Bailey had
a low interest value,'' but the move was denounced in newspaper
editorials as silly.
   Stars and Stripes banned the strip again in 1970, as did some
Southern newspapers, when Walker introduced Lt. Flap, a feisty
black character. Miss Buxley, the bosomy secretary to Gen.
Halftrack, drew protests from feminists.
   Putting the controversy behind, the Army heaped praise on Walker
in its citation Thursday.
   ``His ingenuity in portraying Army members in a humorous manner
has contributed significantly to the morale of our soldiers as they
provide for our national security,'' it read.
   ``I read it and laugh at it, and others do, too,'' McClain
confessed afterward. Said Maj. Gen. Richard E. Stephenson, who
attended the ceremony: ``Beetle Bailey is the vehicle that enables
us to see the lighter side of our profession and keeps us from
taking ourselves too seriously.''
   Accompanied by life-size Beetle and Sarge characters, Walker
gave Army officials a cartoon diorama based on his special Flag Day
strip. It appeared Thursday in the more than 1,800 newspapers
worldwide that carry Beetle Bailey. The diorama will hang on
permanent display in a Pentagon hallway near the main entrance.
   While the Beetle and Sarge characters roamed the corridors
waving to Pentagon secretaries and taking salutes from passing
generals and admirals, Walker was a guest at a cake-cutting
ceremony in the Pentagon's inner courtyard marking the 215th
birthday of the U.S. Army on Thursday.
