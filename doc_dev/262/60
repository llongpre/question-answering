   The death of a ``Doonesbury'' character
who suffered from AIDS didn't prompt any angry phone calls, the
strip's syndicator said Friday.
   Universal Press Syndicate has received complaints about
``Doonesbury'' in the past and once did not distribute strips that
dealt with abortion. The strip was created by Garry Trudeau.
   ``It wasn't a big shock at all,'' said Lee Salem, editorial
director for Universal Press. ``I think Garry is always known for
dealing with major issues of social concern, and I think the way
our society copes with AIDS is certainly within that.''
   The character Andy Lippincott, who has appeared in the strip
since 1976, died in the panels that appeared in Thursday's
newspapers. The character, who was gay, began as a law school
student and evolved into an attorney and a political aide to
another character.
   ``It's not the first time in Doonesbury that a character died,''
Salem said. ``Dick Davenport, another character, died a few years
ago of a heart attack.''
   But Andy's death was apparently the first time AIDS killed a
comic strip figure. Andy was diagnosed with AIDS in the strip in
early 1989.
