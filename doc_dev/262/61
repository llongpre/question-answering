<HEAD>Students Protest Comic's Violent Fantasy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student comic strip depicting a violent
sexual fantasy is ``going too far,'' says the chairman of a group
of University of Illinois women.
   The Chancellor's Committee on the Status of Women is urging
readers of The Daily Illini, which carried the comic strip, to
cancel their subscriptions.
   ``We don't want sex and violence confused in anyone's mind,''
said committee chairwoman Michele Shoresman. ``We've got to stop
this.''
   Managing Editor Dan Bernard defended the cartoonist, saying,
``His goal definitely was to promote awareness of insincerity.''
   The cartoon strip appeared over two days March 27 and March 28
and was drawn by student Mark Peaslee.
   The first strip depicts a conversation between a man and woman
over exams. Another balloon depicts the man's thoughts, reading
``Censored thoughts of degradation, pain and eventual death.''
   After the man leaves, the woman says, ``What a nice guy.''
   The second strip shows another conversation and this time
focuses on the woman's thoughts, reading, ``Hmm... Wonder what
you'd look like...'' and goes on to describe a fantasy involving
bondage and mutilation.
   ``What they did is dangerous because the sarcasm didn't work,''
said committee member Mary Ellen O'Shaughnessey, assistant dean of
students.

<HEAD>Iowa State Journalist Demoted for Comments on Coeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iowa State University student journalist
who wrote that ISU coeds are big and strong but not very
good-looking will keep his column but was removed from the paper's
editorial board.
   Reed Landberg, editor of the Iowa State Daily, said April 2 the
demotion means columnist David Young, a junior from Omaha, Neb., no
longer will write news stories for the paper.
   Landberg said Young may continue writing his ``Facing Reality''
column but that the uncomplimentary view of Iowa State women in a
recent column forced the paper to take disciplinary action.
   Young wrote that Iowa State coeds are ``a breed which has led to
the coining of such terms as `Moo U' and the `Iowa Hip Disease.' ''
   He also said the coeds are muscle-bound.
   ``Unless a male student has a sick desire for farm women who are
bigger and stronger than the East German Women's Olympic Team, he
is likely out of luck,'' he wrote.
   Landberg said Young was one of the paper's best writers but that
many readers assume his writing is biased because of the column.
   ``The mistake in printing Young's last column was not solely his
own,'' Landberg wrote April 3, saying he had an advance copy of the
column. ``It was mine, too, and I must stand behind him for that.''

<HEAD>Winning Teen Essay Disqualified for Copying `Calvin and Hobbes'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The winner of the Florida Young
Writers Contest was disqualified after it was learned that the
beginning of his winning story was an exact copy of three panels of
a ``Calvin and Hobbes'' comic strip.
   Jeffrey Wright, 17, a senior at Fletcher High School, said April
2 the plagiarism was unintentional. He said he keeps notebooks
filled with story ideas and sometimes jots down passages he reads.
   ``If someone took something of mine, I'd be upset. It's wrong. I
know I owe everyone an apology,'' Wright said.
   The story, titled, ``Tracer Bullet,'' describes a child playing
detective while cleaning his room. Tracer Bullet also was the name
of the character in the ``Calvin and Hobbes'' strip.
   The first four paragraphs of Wright's story had appeared in The
Florida Times-Union on April 2 with the announcement that he had
won, and a caller pointed out the duplication to Mike Clark, the
newspaper's reader advocate.
   Wright also lost a $1,000 scholarship to the University of North
Florida, which sponsored the contest along with the Times-Union.
