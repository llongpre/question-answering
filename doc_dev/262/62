<HEAD>`Steve Canyon' Ends With A Tribute</HEAD>

   ``Steve Canyon'' makes its last appearance in
the world's newspapers Sunday with an affectionate tribute to the
creator of the 41-year-old comic strip, the late Milton Caniff.
   Seventy-eight cartoonists _ including Garry Trudeau of
``Doonesbury,'' Charles Schulz of ``Peanuts'' and Mort Walker of
``Beetle Bailey'' _ signed Sunday's strip, a single panel drawn by
Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Bill Mauldin.
   The strip depicts Steve Canyon and Mauldin's famous GI, Willie,
burying Caniff. The grave is marked with an upright artist's pen
crowned with an Air Force helmet bearing Caniff's name.
   Caniff, who also created ``Terry and the Pirates,'' died of lung
cancer on April 3. He was 81.
