<TEXT>     A two-week series of "Doonesbury" comic strips focusing on discredited
allegations that Vice President Dan Quayle used drugs is scheduled to begin
today in about 1,400 newspapers. At least 10, however -- including the San
Jose Mercury News (see story below) -- have decided not to carry the series.; 
 The allegations of Quayle's drug involvement -- including reports that the
Drug Enforcement Agency had a file on Quayle during a 1982 investigation into
cocaine on Capitol Hill when he was an Indiana senator -- were supplied to
"Doonesbury" cartoonist Garry Trudeau by Washington free-lance writer Cody
Shearer.;   Trudeau wasn't the first person to whom Shearer took his
information. The allegations previously were checked out and found groundless
by the Washington Post's Bob Woodward, the CBS news show "60 Minutes" and the
Washington bureau for Knight-Ridder newspapers, which includes the Mercury
News.;   The man who made the allegations was given a lie detector test by "60
Minutes," said Don Hewitt, executive producer. "During the lie detector test
the guy cried and finally broke down in front of Morley Safer and said, 'I
made it all up because I wanted to get out of jail.' " "60 Minutes" never
broadcast the story.;   "I called Garry Trudeau and told him, 'Garry, you got
taken like Grant took Richmond,' " Hewitt said.;   Trudeau could not be
reached for comment. But Alan McDermott, managing editor of Universal Press
Syndicate, which distributes "Doonesbury," told the Boston Globe that the
syndicate's lawyers had seen evidence "that there is a file and in fact the
file discusses a cocaine purchase and, in fact, there has been an attempt to
cover up this file." He added that "our lawyers feel comfortable with the
evidence we have seen.";   Added McDermott: "This is not fiction.";   Raises
cover-up issue;   Lee Salem, editorial director of Universal Press Syndicate,
acknowledged the syndicate has no information that the allegations are true,
but added that the end of the series raises what he said was "the most
important issue and that's the cover-up.";   The strip was intended to raise
questions, not report facts, he said. "We never claimed that 'Doonesbury' was
fair. This is a political satirist and commentator, not a reporter.";   That
distinction didn't satisfy some newspaper editors.;   John W. Walter Jr.,
managing editor of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, said the paper would
not run the Quayle series because it was unfair to the vice president. "It's
too much of a blurring of fact, fiction and diatribe. Enough is enough," said
Walter.;   " 'Doonesbury' does some brilliant things but it occasionally goes
too far," said Stephen Waters, general manager of the Rome (N.Y.) Daily
Sentinel, which is also suspending the strip. "We thought this went too far."
The Daily Sentinel has suspended "Doonesbury" twice before over political
controversies.;   Other newspapers pulling the strip include the Charlotte
Observer, the Rochester (N.Y.) Times-Union, the Houston Post, the Newport News
(Va.) Daily Press, the Buffalo News, the Providence Journal-Bulletin, and the
Stamford (Conn.) Advocate.;   The Chicago Tribune is withholding two strips
containing allegations the paper could not confirm, said John Lux, associate
features editor. "It'd be different if they were funny. This masquerades as
reporting," he said.;   Editors at the Washington Post and the Los Angeles
Times said those papers would run the Quayle strips.;   The Indianapolis Star
and News, owned by relatives of Quayle, said it would run the strip. "We're
going to run a story outlining the controversy and the stories we ran on it
originally," said assistant managing editor Ted Daniels. He said the paper
would probably receive complaints from some readers, but "we would have more
of an outcry if we didn't run it.";   Trudeau has shaken up his subscribers in
the past with strips portraying bleak living conditions for U.S. soldiers
during the Persian Gulf war, alleged Mafia ties of Frank Sinatra, and the
anti-abortion movie "The Silent Scream.";   The current two-week series
focuses attention on a prison inmate who claims he was Dan Quayle's marijuana
dealer.;   Convicted felon Brett Kimberlin, 37, alleged during the 1988
presidential campaign that he sold marijuana to Quayle in the early 1970s,
when the vice president was a law student at Indiana University.;   Kimberlin,
who is serving a 51-year prison term for drug smuggling and bombing offenses,
also says he knew, but won't say how, that the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration had a file on Quayle stemming from a 1982 investigation of
cocaine use on Capitol Hill.;   Quayle has denied the accusation, which was
never substantiated. The DEA said last week that it had investigated
allegations raised in 1982 that Quayle had bought such drugs in Indiana.;  
The investigation continued into 1983 as the allegations were "pursued to
their source and were determined to be untrue," the DEA said. The agency said
it kept the file confidential, "consistent with Department of Justice
policy.";   Kimberlin's story;   In the comic strip, Doonesbury's fictional
Washington Post reporter Rick Redfern interviews Kimberlin by telephone in
pursuit of a story that the Bush administration covered up a DEA investigation
into Quayle.;   In reality, Kimberlin has never spoken to Trudeau.;   "I'm not
grandstanding. I didn't talk to Trudeau. I wasn't even aware of what was going
on. I'm only responding now to media inquiries," Kimberlin said Thursday from
the Federal Correctional Institution in Memphis, Tenn.;   "I want to make it
clear that Danny never talked to me about cocaine or buying cocaine or
anything like that and I have no personal knowledge of that," Kimberlin said.
"All I was doing was saying there is this file and it should be checked out.";
  Kimberlin wanted to tell a group of reporters just that at a Nov. 4, 1988,
news conference -- four days before the election that made Quayle the nation's
vice president.;   Kimberlin also planned to talk more about what he had told
several other journalists before the news conference: that for roughly a year
he sold Quayle one-ounce bags of marijuana in motel and restaurant parking
lots near the Indiana University campus, chatting occasionally about golf and
rock music.;   Quayle denies all;   The news conference was canceled by prison
officials before it began and Kimberlin was placed in solitary confinement. He
has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Prisons claiming his free
speech rights were violated by the actions, which he contends were politically
motivated.;   Quayle has denied knowing Kimberlin. "He's a convicted felon.
Geez," Quayle told The Boston Globe last week. "I mean, he's in jail.";   Both
Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, have accused Trudeau of having a personal
vendetta against him.;   "I don't mind a good political fight," Quayle said.
"But this is just totally absurd. It's wrong. It's false. And I'm not
surprised, but I am outraged.;   "Garry Trudeau knows that these allegations
on which the latest comic strip (is based) are totally without foundation,"
Quayle said last week.;   During her Friday stop in San Jose, Marilyn Quayle
also took on the cartoonist. "It's so malicious," she said. "I think the guy's
(Trudeau) got real problems. And I think we've hit a new low in politics when
that kind of behavior becomes the norm. "  </TEXT>
