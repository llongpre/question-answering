   The Warren Beatty-Madonna movie may be
attracting a lot of hoopla, but Dick Tracy is no newcomer to the
screen.
   Tracy purists may prefer ``Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome,'' circa
1947, in which the fabled flatfoot does battle with the great Boris
Karlorff. Or maybe ``Dick Tracy vs. Cueball,'' a low-budget 1946
flick in which the detective takes on a bald smuggler.
   Then there are two other RKO features of the mid-1940s that
starred Ralph Byrd or Morgan Conway as the steel-jawed, hawk-nosed
sleuth. Or, see Dick Tracy as an FBI agent in ``Dick Tracy's
G-Men,'' a 1939 yarn with Byrd chasing the evil Zarnoff.
   If you have the patience, you could watch four serials, dating
from 1937 to 1941, with Byrd as Chester Gould's comic-strip hero.
   Beatty's rediscovery of Dick Tracy follows the pattern of recent
Hollywood times: Filmmakers have been exploiting long-establish
characters of comic strips and books, giving them a modern look for
today's audiences. ``Batman'' is the biggest success story thus far.
   Created by Bob Kane in 1939, ``Batman'' flew onto the big screen
with serials in 1943 and 1949. The sensation of the 1965-67
television series led to a 1966 feature, also starring Adam West
and Burt Ward. Last year a hyped-up ``Batman,'' starring Jack
Nicholson and Michael Keaton, proved a huge moneymaker.
   ``Superman'' dates back to 1940s serials, a 1951 quickie
``Superman and the Mole Men'' and the subsequent TV series starring
George Reeves. Christopher Reeve took over the cape in the 1978
epic ``Superman.'' It was a huge hit, followed by three sequels
with diminishing results.
   ``Little Orphan Annie'' first hit the screen in 1932 with Mitzi
Green as the carrot-topped waif. Then _ gloryoskee _ ``Annie''
became a hit Broadway musical in the 1970s. Its success was
repeated in a 1982 movie, directed by John Huston, of all people,
and starring Albert Finney, Carol Burnett and Bernadette Peters.
   Not all comic heroes and heroines have done as well in recent
years. ``Flash Gordon'' was an expensive failure in 1980, helping
along the eventual collapse of Dino de Laurentiis' American
enterprise. ``Popeye'' bombed in 1980 despite the best efforts of
Robin Williams to imitate the one-eye spinach fancier. ``Brenda
Starr,'' with Brooke Shields as the resourceful reporter, remains
on the shelf after three years, partly because of legal tangles.
   ``Brenda Starr'' was made by New World Pictures, which has since
gone out of business. There are disputes over New World's assets,
and whether or not the movie will be released depends largely on
how the disputes are resolved. But the film has appeared in some
overseas countries.
   Motion pictures and comic strips were born at about the same
time and almost immediately began their association. Hearst
cartoonist Winsor McCay drew his ``Little Nemo'' for the screen in
1911 and followed with ``Gertie the Dinosaur'' in 1914. ``Krazy
Kat,'' ``Bringing Up Father'' and ``The Katzenjammer Kids'' were
other early movie cartoons.
   Comics also contributed characters for live action: ``Ella
Cinders'' (Colleen Moore), 1922; ``Tillie the Toiler'' (Marion
Davies), 1927; ``Skippy'' (Jackie Cooper), 1930; ``Harold Teen''
(Arthur Lake), 1934; and ``Joe Palooka'' (Stewart Erwin), 1934, and
another version in 1946 with Joe Kirkwood, plus sequels.
   Serials, which Hollywood ground out from 1930 to 1950, were
ideal for telling comic book stories. They included: ``Archie,''
``Captain Marvel,'' ``Flash Gordon,'' ``Jungle Jim,'' ``Mandrake
the Magician,'' ``Talespin Tommy,'' ``Brick Bradford'' and ``Terry
and the Pirates.''
   For 10 years starting in 1938, Arthur Lake and Penny Singleton
annually appeared in two ``Blondie'' films, as sandwich-loving
Dagwood Bumstead and his dizzy wife. After his Tarzan days were
over, Johnny Weissmuller made 12 quickies as ``Jungle Jim'' from
1948 to 1955.
   After scoring as a musical on Broadway, ``L'il Abner'' came to
the screen in 1959 with all its Dogpatch characters intact.
``Prince Valiant'' put Robert Wagner in a page-boy wig in 1954.
Bill Mauldin's dogface soldiers Willie and Joe appeared in the 1951
``Up Front'' and did a sequel, ``Back at the Front.''
   Racier comics also have made it to the screen: ``Modesty
Blaise'' (Monica Vitti), 1966; ``Barbarella'' (Jane Fonda) 1968;
and the only X-rated cartoon movie, ``Fritz the Cat'' in 1971.
