   Many of those involved in the fight against
AIDS are lauding cartoonist Garry Trudeau's comic depiction of the
ignorance, unfounded fears and public indifference that sometimes
surround the disease.
   ``Humor is essential for educating people,'' said Rene Durazzo
of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. ``It gets them to look at
themselves without a lot of harsh confrontations; gets them
laughing at their own silly attitudes.''
   In a three-week series of his Doonesbury strip that began March
27 and ends April 15, Trudeau is gently dishing up some rather
biting comments on how the public and government have responded to
the disease.
   Centered around a town hall meeting in San Francisco, part of
character Lacy Davenport's congressional district, the strip so far
has poked fun at fears of getting AIDS through casual contact, the
view that AIDS largely affects only homosexuals and the public's
discomfort at dealing with various sexual issues raised in its
context.
   At one point, the 81-year-old Davenport finds herself unable to
use the word AIDS, instead saying ``the great unpleasantness.''
   A long-time character in the strip, Andy Lippincott, has
developed AIDS.
   Trudeau told a columnist for the Pioneer Press Dispatch of St.
Paul, Minn., this week that he had a ``hard time finding the right
approach'' to AIDS.
   ``I had to strip it (the disease) of its taboos to attack the
fear and ignorance by laughing in its face,'' said Trudeau, who
rarely grants interviews. He did not return a call placed by The AP.
   Brother Kevin Worth, a Roman Catholic monk who works with AIDS
patients at Mother Teresa's Spiritual Resource Center in Oakland,
called Trudeau's AIDS series an ``effective way of uncovering the
public's ignorance'' about AIDS, which destroys the body's immune
system.
   ``Lacy Davenport's unwillingness to name the issue represents a
common response on the part of the American public, much of which
prefers that this disease simply did not exist, or would just go
away,'' he added. ``Trudeau is showing us it will not.''
   According to Lee Salem, a spokesman for Universal Press
Syndicate in Kansas City, Mo., which distributes the comic strip,
only one newspaper has refused to run the series. The Canadian
paper, which he did not identify, considered the series in ``bad
taste.''
   In San Francisco, where 9,000 people are expected to be living
with the disease by the end of the year, the comic strip has been
greeted with guffaws at numerous AIDS organizations.
   Lance Henderson, finance director of The Names Project, which
produces a giant memorial quilt using panels submitted by survivors
of people who have died of AIDS, is posting each segment of the
daily strip on his door.
   But some involved in the fight against AIDS are surprised the
often controversial cartoonist, known for his sharp political wit,
has taken so long to address AIDS issues.
   ``I wish he had done this four years ago,'' said Democratic Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. ``Most of what I've seen so far is a
little after the fact. These issues have been raised before.''
   Carisa Cunningham of the Gay Mens Heath Crisis in New York feels
it is appropriate that Davenport represents a sometimes
ill-informed public and government officials who can be
frustratingly prudish.
   ``He's addressing the issue of denial in Lacy, who in the past
has been a sympathetic character,'' Cunningham said in a telephone
interview.
   ``We aren't meant to hate or despise her because of her
ignorance. It's telling us that even well-meaning people are having
a hard time dealing with AIDS.''
