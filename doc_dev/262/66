   Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Doug Marlette,
whose syndicated comic strip ``Kudzu'' revolves around life in a
small southern town, is leaving his native Dixie for the Big Apple.
   In his resignation letter Monday, Marlette said he resigned as
the Atlanta Constitution's editorial cartoonist because he was upset
by the resignation of editor Bill Kovach three months ago.
   Kovach, who hired Marlette away from The Charlotte (N.C.)
Observer in April 1987, resigned in a dispute with senior executives.
   ``I have spent many sleepless nights over the last two months
trying to find a way to stay here,'' Marlette wrote Arnold
Rosenfeld, who took Kovach's place as editor of the Atlanta Journal
and the Atlanta Constitution, which are published by Cox Enterprises.
   ``As a native Southerner, I came here inspired by the vision of
Bill Kovach for world-class journalism in this region so richly
deserving of it,'' wrote Marlette, who will join Newsday on New
York's Long Island.
   ``Tragically, that dream was thwarted. Like many Southerners
before me, I head north with a sense of sadness and longing for what
might have been.''
   Constitution Editorial Page Editor Tom Teepen said he knew of no
disputes involving Marlette. ``There have not been any clashes here
over cartoons,'' Teepen said.
   Born in Greensboro, N.C., and raised in Laurel, Miss., and
Sanford, Fla., Marlette has been drawing newspaper cartoons since he
was 16. He spent 15 years at the Observer before moving to Atlanta.
   Marlette won a Pulitzer for editorial cartoons last year for work
at the Observer and the Constitution. He was the first cartoonist to
win a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University.
   His editorial cartoons are syndicated to more than 125 newspapers
in the United States and abroad and have been compiled in five
books. His ``Kudzu'' strip, based in the mythical town of Bypass,
N.C., has been collected in four books.
   ``Leaving is a very sad ... thing. I feel real ambivalence about
it,'' the 39-year-old cartoonist said. ``At the same time, I'm
excited about the opportunity.''
   ``Obviously, the addition of an exceptional talent such as Doug
Marlette to the editorial pages of Newsday ... will strengthen what
we believe to be the best viewpoints in the New York area,'' Newsday
Publisher Robert M. Johnson said in a statement.
   Marlette is expected to begin work for Newsday, which is owned by
Times Mirror of Los Angeles, in about three weeks.
