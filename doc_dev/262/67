<HEAD>Because Of Massacre, Cartoonist Kills Week Of Strips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau
withdrew a week of his comic strips after his gentle lampoon of the
student protests for democracy turned tragic with the Beijing
massacres.
   All last week the strip was set in Beijing's Tiananmen Square,
where students had been protesting since April.
   This week Trudeau zeroed in on the controversy over the recently
published diary of the late artist Andy Warhol, but he had planned
to take his characters back to China next week.
   ``Then everything intensified over the weekend, so we killed that
week,'' said Lee Salem, editorial director of the Kansas City-based
Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes the strip. ``The whole
situation blew up.''
   Salem said another week of strips on the China theme, for use
starting June 12, had been sent to newspapers last Friday when the
weekend's events in which hundreds were killed made the cartoons
inappropriate.
   Salem said the substitute strips sent out Sunday provide ``kind
of an obtuse look at the Alaska oil spill.''
   Trudeau told New York Newsday that the premise of the substitute
strips ``is that the artist tips an ink bottle on a whole week's
worth of strips.''
   He told the newspaper that the second week of strips on China was
``predicated on a peaceful resolution.''
   ``That was a very bad miscalculation ... and now obviously
inappropriate,'' he said.
