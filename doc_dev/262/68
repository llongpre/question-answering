   For 40 years, the Army grumbled about Pvt.
Beetle Bailey. He's a real misfit, they said. Lazy. No spit and
polish. Drives the Sarge nuts. He'll never make corporal. Let him
peel potatoes forever.
   Then one fine day, somebody in the Pentagon with silver stars on
his shoulders looked around the table and told the men with silver
eagles on their shirt collars: Hey, you know, the little guy's
funny.
   Yes, sir! they all replied, nodding in unison.
   And so it was that an incredulous Mort Walker, a cartoonist who
once slogged through the mud at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., as an Army
draftee in World War II, was ushered into the Pentagon on Thursday
and given a hero's welcome.
   Walker, who created the Beetle Bailey comic strip in 1950, could
hardly believe it. For years, he had braved the Army's fire when
Beetle and the gang _ Zero, Sgt. Snorkel, Lt. Fuzz, Gen. Halftrack
_ did something foolish.
   On Thursday, he blinked before TV lights in the Pentagon
briefing room. Generals slapped him on the back, praised him to the
skies and asked for his autograph. One of them gave Walker a framed
``Certificate of Appreciation for Patriotic Civilian Service'' with
a ribbon in red, white and blue.
   The war was over.
   ``I can't believe I'm actually here,'' Walker said, ``As hard as
it is to find anything in the Pentagon, they finally found a sense
of humor.''
   ``Through it all, you have entertained us, although sometimes we
haven't always liked it,'' said Brig Gen. Bill McClain, the Army's
public affairs chief.
   McClain confessed that he reads Beetle Bailey ``and I laugh at
it, and others do, too.''
   Maj. Gen. Richard E. Stephenson said, ``Beetle Bailey is the
vehicle that enables us to see the lighter side of our profession
and keeps us from taking ourselves too seriously.''
   The Army brass wasn't always that charitable. They thought the
strip presented an unflattering image of Army life, that Beetle was
a poor role model for modern GIs.
   The Tokyo edition of The Stars and Stripes military newspaper
drummed Beetle off its pages in 1954 because the strip poked fun at
officers, although the official explanation was that ``Beetle
Bailey had a low interest value.''
   Stars and Stripes banned the strip again in 1970, as did some
Southern newspapers, when Walker introduced a feisty black
character named Lt. Flap who complained about Sarge's ``honky
outfit.'' Feminists protested Miss Buxley, the bosomy secretary to
Gen. Halftrack.
   All was forgiven Thursday. The citation said Walker's
``ingenuity in portraying Army members in a humorous manner has
contributed significantly to the morale of our soldiers as they
provide for our national security.''
   The cartoonist also joined the generals in the Pentagon's
sun-splashed inner courtyard to watch a cake-cutting ceremony
marking the 215th birthday of the Army.
   Walker gave Army officials a diorama based on his special Flag
Day cartoon, which appeared Thursday in the more than 1,800
newspapers worldwide that carry the syndicated Beetle Bailey strip.
The diorama will hang permanently in a hallway near the Pentagon's
main entrance.
   Two life-size Beetle and Sarge figures who accompanied Walker
roamed the corridors waving to Pentagon secretaries and exchanged
salutes from passing generals and admirals.
   McClain, the Army public affairs boss, summed up the situation:
``If you can't laugh at yourself, something is intrinsically wrong
with you.''
