<HEAD>`Pogo' Comic Strip Returns After 15 Years Of Playing Possum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Pogo'' comic strip, which went into
hibernation 15 years ago with the death of artist Walt Kelly, will
return in January with new adventures of the critters at the
Okefenokee Swamp.
   Artist Neal Sternecky, 27, and writer Larry Doyle, 29, who
worked together on the student newspaper at the University of
Ilinois at Urbana-Champaign, will revive Pogo the possum, Albert
the Alligator, Porky Pine, Howland Owl and Churchy LaFemme.
   ``Pogo,'' one of the first comic strips to comment on political
affairs and social issues, will continue to address current events,
said Lou Schwartz, president of Los Angeles Times Syndicate, which
will distribute the strip.
