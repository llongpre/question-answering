<TEXT>     He created "Mark Trail" in 1946 and it became a favorite of millions of
newspaper readers. At his death, the strip was appearing in more than 200
newspapers.;    The strip was so popular that when the Washington Post decided
to drop it from its comic pages in February, thousands of readers protested.
The newspaper reinstated the strip in March and ran two full pages of back
strips to bring readers up to date.;    The newspaper said it received more
mail protesting the decision to drop "Mark Trail" than it got on the Watergate
scandal.;    Mr. Dodd and two associates, Tom Hill and Jack Elrod, produced
the comic strip for years, until Hill's death of a heart attack at 58 in 1978.
Mr. Dodd both wrote and drew for the strip until 1960, and continued to write
for it until retiring in 1980. Elrod, who lives in suburban Atlanta, writes
and draws the strip today.;    Mark Trail is, of course, a writer and
photographer for an outdoor magazine. He and his companion Andy, a Saint
Bernard, go from one adventure to another, and get into one scrape after
another, until Andy saves Mark or vice versa.;    Mark's friend, Dr. Tom
Davis, operates a wildlife preserve, and Mark is romantically involved with
Cherry, Dr. Davis' daughter.;    The strip has won numerous awards for its
wholesomeness and its support of causes such as conservation and the
preservation of endangered species.;    Mr. Dodd and his associates worked for
nearly three decades at a combination home and studio he owned on 130 acres on
Brandon Mill Road. Mr. Dodd bought the land in 1950 and built a home and
studio in 1954. He named the place "Lost Forest," which is also the name of
the wildlife preserve in the comic strip.;    Mr. Dodd was forced to sell
about 100 acres in 1973 because he could no longer afford the taxes. He sold
the remaining land and buildings to the New School, for students with learning
disabilities, when he retired in 1980. He moved to a condominium in
Gainesville, and later to a nursing home.;    The comic strip often reflected
unsuccessful efforts made by Mr. Dodd to keep the real "Lost Forest" intact.
Land developers sometimes are the villains in the strip.;    A pipe was a
"Mark Trail" trademark throughout Mr. Dodd's supervision of the strip.
However, the pipe was dropped about 1983 after a young reader wrote Elrod
describing the ill effects of smoking.;    Mr. Dodd created "Mark Trail" at
43, while living in Gainesville and drawing "Back Home Again," a comic strip
that by his own account was "mediocre.";    Seeking a new subject, he turned
to drawing a comic strip about the outdoors, "Mark Trail.";    Who was the
model for the comic strip? At times Mr. Dodd said it was John Wayt, his former
neighbor in north Atlanta. At other times the cartoonist said it was a man he
had seen in a New York hotel while trying to sell the idea to syndicates.;   
The comic strip was a success, its creator said, "because it is outdoors, and
we have animals. It is a twist the other adventure strips don't have. There is
human interest. And we have tried earnestly to keep it absolutely clean."  </TEXT>
