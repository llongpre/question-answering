   Relatives and fans of the late Walt Kelly,
creator of the Pogo comic strip, will travel to the edge of the
Okefenokee Swamp this weekend to open a memorial to the cartoonist.
   The Okefenokee, located just south of Waycross in southeastern
Georgia, is the home of the fictional Pogo Possum and his critter
friends.
   Among those expected at Saturday's dedication of the Walt Kelly
Room at the Okefenokee Heritage Center in Waycross are Selby Kelly,
the cartoonist's widow, and writer Larry Doyle and artist Neal
Sternecky, the team selected by Mrs. Kelly to revive the strip.
   The current version of the strip is distributed by the Los
Angeles Times Syndicate.
   In addition to the dedication, Waycross' annual PogoFest will
include a screening of a film on the life of Kelly, the auction of
six original Kelly Pogo strips and a question-and-answer session by
Mrs. Kelly, Doyle and Sternecky.
   The Kelly estate has donated to the memorial all the things the
artist used to create his menagerie of Albert Alligator, Pogo
Possum, Howland Owl, Churchy Lafemme, Beauregard Bugleboy,
Porkypine and other swamp critters.
   The room, made to resemble Kelly's New York apartment, will
display the portable typewriter, easel, ink bottles, pens and
brushes Kelly used to draw the original Pogo from the 1940s through
the early '70s.
   On permanent display will be Kelly's hat rack with his everyday
coat and hat, as well as his more formal coat and top hat, his
walking cane, his dark-rimmed spectacles, pipes and ashtrays.
   The room also will contain Mrs. Kelly's baby grand piano with
the out-of-print ``Pogo Songbook,'' for which Kelly wrote both
music and lyrics.
   Worldwide interest in Kelly and the Pogo characters runs high.
The Pogo Fan Club has grown 300 percent since 1988, said Steve
Thompson, who runs the international club from Richfield, Minn.
   Thompson said he hears monthly from fans in Canada, Germany,
Denmark, Italy, England and Scotland. Recently, an Australian
chapter was added.
   ``I knew the baby boomers would welcome the rejuvenation of the
Pogo strip,'' he said, ``but I've been pleasantly surprised by the
interest shown by the younger generation.
   ``It's a strip that makes you think. It takes some effort. But
it rewards that effort. That's why I think it's been popular on
college campuses since day one.''
