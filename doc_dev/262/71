   Only hours after their attorneys won a round in
court, editors of the Dallas Times Herald explained to readers why
some regular features were missing from the newspaper.
   A federal judge in Kansas City, Mo., late Tuesday denied
Universal Press Syndicate's request to prevent the Times Herald from
printing 26 comic strips and columns The Dallas Morning News wants
exclusively.
   But because an agreement between the syndicate and the Times
Herald permitting publication of the features expired Tuesday, the
newspaper was forced to pull the features from today's editions.
   A note accompanied the front-page story that apprised of the
development in Kansas City. In it, ``The Editors'' informed readers
of the ongoing litigation and the absence of the features. They
asked that readers ``accept our apology and be assured that we will
continue to fight to return all your favorite features to the Dallas
Times Herald.''
   In the section where readers were accustomed to finding ``Dear
Abby,'' the bold type read, ``Thanks for reading Dear Abby in the
Dallas Times Herald for the past 31 years.'' Below that, the
newspaper printed, ``We apologize for being unable to bring our
loyal readers Dear Abby in its usual place today. We are fighting in
court to return it to you. _ The Editor''
   Other boxed messages with apologies were on the comics pages
where eight Universal Press comic strips usually appear.
   Universal Press Syndicate has reached an agreement with the A.H.
Belo Corp., owner of the Morning News, that would give the newspaper
exclusive Dallas-area rights to the comics and features, which
include ``Dear Abby'' and ``Doonesbury.''
   Universal Press had filed a lawsuit and sought a preliminary
injunction to prevent the Times Herald from using its comics and
features beyond the cancellation date.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge D. Brook Bartlett said he would
not approve the injunction because Kansas City-based Universal Press
had not convinced him one was necessary.
   Universal Press will continue fighting any efforts the Times
Herald might make in state courts to print the UPS features, said
David Oliver, an attorney for the syndicate.
   ``If we learn that tomorrow there are Universal Press features in
the Times Herald, then the Times Herald has run those features
without our consent and without a state order,'' Oliver said. ``That
would be a copyright infringement, and we would be right back here
in federal court.''
   Times Herald Editor Roy Bode said the newspaper has no intention
of using the material beyond the cancellation dates without the
permission of Universal Press or a legal authority.
   But, he added: ``It's an extraordinary thing for a syndicate to
withdraw its strips from one paper to take them to another paper. I
don't think it's a reputable practice.''
   John McMeel, president of Universal Press, said his company had a
30-day cancellation agreement on most of the comics and features
with the Times Herald. The cancellation date for all but two of the
comics and features was Saturday, but lawyers for the newspaper and
the syndicate agreed that the Times Herald could carry the material
through Tuesday's hearing.
   There was a 90-day cancellation agreement for Doonesbury, the
popular Pulitzer Prize-winning strip, and another comic, which runs
through Nov. 1.
   The Times Herald has sued in Texas state court seeking to prevent
its rival from gaining exclusive Dallas-area rights to the Universal
Press material.
