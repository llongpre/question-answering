   After years of absorbing the blame for the drawing in
Doonesbury, it's odd to wake up one day and find myself
stripped of the credit. In the past, I have not so much
"destroyed" my final pencil drawings as pitched them, not
believing them to be anything special (and having little
value on the collector's market, as do inked drawings).
Newsweek's Jonathan Alter dissuaded me of this practice, and
I now have several hundred of them cluttering up my studio. I
would like to issue the Journal an open invitation to visit
and cart off as many pencil drawings -- and their inked
companion pieces -- as you may need to satisfy future
curators. The fine-arts mavens may not go along with your
characterization of the drawings as "polished" (the kindliest
description I have ever received in print, by far), but
perhaps they will concur that little has been lost or gained
in the transformation of my light gray pencil lines into
photo-reproducible black lines.
   As to your editorial, all of us at Universal Press
Syndicate greatly enjoyed the we-were-just-kidding defense
("The Satirist and the Inker," Dec. 18), and hope we will be
forgiven for not recognizing wit when we saw it on the
editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. I should point
out, however, that contrary to your claim, I know of no comic
strip on which the inker has ever been credited. Joint credit
lines mean that one creator writes the strip and the other
draws it. The technical assistance of an inker, while valued
and appreciated, is considered no more worthy of joint credit
than the efforts of a newspaper editor, say, in the
preparation of an article.

   Garry Trudeau
   New York
   ---
   Your editorial on Garry Trudeau continued to leave a wrong
impression. In profiling Mr. Trudeau for Newsweek's Oct. 15,
1990, issue, I had the chance to watch him sketch his strips
in pencil, which he does to save time. Then I compared those
pencil sketches with the inked drawings sent out by his
syndicate. With the exception of occasional instructions on
filling in black backgrounds and a few other technical
matters, the drawings were identical. Even the faintest
suggestion that the art is not his -- or that the strip
should have a co-byline -- is ludicrous. I write this, by the
way, as someone who has recently attacked Mr. Trudeau's
strips on Dan Quayle.
   The editorial seemed to suggest that the standard of
fairness on the Journal's editorial page should be no
different than that of a political cartoonist. What a joke --
on your readers.
