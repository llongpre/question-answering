   After 41 years of flying dangerous
missions around the globe, comic-strip hero Steve Canyon was
hanging up his blue flight suit today.
   Air Force Col. Stevenson B. Canyon was to be retired in a
ceremony at Ohio State University. Canyon's creator, cartoonist
Milton Caniff, was a graduate of Ohio State and willed many of his
drawings and papers to the university. He died last year at age 81.
   ``Through Steve Canyon, Milt Caniff did a lot to keep up the
spirits of fliers and the Air Force,'' said 1st Lt. Lynn Ellen
Bryant of McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. ``He really became
a part of Air Force lore, and people remember.''
   A biography and list of Canyon's exploits have been prepared by
the Air Force for this afternoon's presentation to the university.
An exhibit will be established in the journalism school's library,
which recently was dedicated to Caniff's memory.
   The final Steve Canyon strip appeared in newspapers on June 4,
shortly after Caniff's death.
   Ohio State spokesman Leon Rubin said today's presentation was
the Air Force's idea. Canyon is said to have attended Ohio State
before joining the Army Air Corps _ the predecessor of the Air
Force _ in 1947.
   Ms. Bryant said the Air Force went through all the old Canyon
comic strips to compile a ``personnel record''for the character.
   ``People here and in New York have dediced a lot of time,
energy and imagination to the project,'' Ms. Bryant said. ``We are
very happy and honored to do something that will be seen by others
and is going to last.''
   Canyon's service record ``includes decorations, citations,
movement orders for each base, family data, all sorts of good
stuff,'' she said. ``We also put together a flight record listing
all his flying achievements, the planes he was qualified to fly,
the hours in each plane, the instructor, how many missions he
flew.''
   The Air Force decided that since his record was so varied, he
should be assigned to the Office of Special Investigations.
   ``That also allowed us to say certain things were classified and
we coudn't discuss them,'' Ms. Bryant said.
   The Air Force planned to present the university with a modern
uniform with Canyon's insignia, rank and name tag, along with a
retiremente for Canyon and his wife, Summer Smith.
   The officers at McGuire made a case for the display that will
hold Canyon's 13 medals and eight ribbons. It is inscribed:
``Stevenson B. Canyon, AAF-USAF, 1947.''
