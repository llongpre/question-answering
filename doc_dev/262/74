<LEADPARA>  Q  "The Family Circus" comic strips that ran the week of March 18 were
supposedly drawn by "Billy, age 7." I think Bil Keane is getting up in years.
Is his son, Billy, really 7 years old?;    -- Dave Hill, Santa Clara  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A  Nope. "Keane's sons are all grown," says Karen Moy, assistant to the comics
editor for King Features Syndicate. "Billy" is one of the characters in "The
Family Circus" and "will always be 7 years old in the strip," Moy says. Keane,
who drew those "Billy" strips, likes to use the device from time to time, she
says.; No escaping the confusion; Q  I called the toll-free number Holiday Inn
provided for its "Great Weekend Escape"-Ivory Soap promotion. The promotion
would entitle me to one night free with one paid night. I wanted to stay at
the Holiday Inn at National Airport in Washington, D.C., on April 27 and 28. I
was quoted a rate of $106 the first night. This sounded high for a weekend, so
I called the same Holiday Inn direct and was told the normal rate was $54 a
night. It seems as if the coupon only buys me a $2 discount because I can use
it only with a $106 rate. This free weekend night sounds like a scam to me.;  
 -- Roger Reedy, Sunnyvale; A  That wasn't Holiday Inn's intention, says
Beverly Robertson, director of communications and public relations. "We're not
trying to scam anyone," Robertson says. You ran into two different promotions,
both offered through the Holiday Inn corporate office but applied differently
by the individual Holiday Inns. In addition to the "Great Weekend Escape"
two-for-one weekend, is a "Great Rate" promotion, giving customers discounts
of at least 20 percent off their weekend stays, Robertson says. But individual
Holiday Inns can increase that discount, and National Airport Holiday Inn set
its "Great Rate" prices at more than 50 percent off, Robertson says, adding
that it was "very unusual." In most cases, the "Great Weekend Escape" beats
the "Great Rate" prices by a larger margin, she says.; Teen paying his debt; Q
 I caught a teen-ager attempting to steal my car. I called the police, and the
teen was arrested. At the Jan. 7, 1990, hearing he was ordered to pay
restitution of $827.49. I have not received a dime. I spoke to the boy's
probation officer, and he said there was nothing he could do to force the
payment. I recently found out that the teen's family changed its phone number,
and I have no way of contacting the family. It seems to me as though the boy
is not being made to pay for his crime.;    -- L.Y., San Jose; A  He is.
However, the youth first had to earn some money, says Fred Rupprecht,
probation manager with the Santa Clara County Probation Department. That meant
the youth had to graduate from high school and get a job. He just started his
first job a few weeks ago and received his first paycheck March 15, Rupprecht
says. His first $100 installment to you is on its way, he says, adding you
should expect future installments weekly until the debt is paid. Rupprecht
says you may have misunderstood the probation officer; the department is
responsible for making sure its charges make ordered restitution. Rupprecht
says a supervisor has talked to the probation officer to make sure he also
understands this. We have provided you with that supervisor's name and phone
number in case you have any problems in the future.  </TEXT>
