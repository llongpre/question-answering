   Four turtles wielding Ninja weapons,
the brainchildren of a sandwich maker and a self-described hack
cartoonist, are threatening to move into the top 10 of the Christmas
toy market.
   ``They are just flying off the shelves,'' said David Valentine, a
toy industry analyst for Standard &amp; Poors.
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have hit No. 11 in the Toy &amp; Hobby
World charts of best sellers just four years after they were
conceived by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman during a late-evening
sketching duel.
   Stores report they can't keep up with demand for the goofy
turtles with their slice-and-dice arm action and their silly
one-liners (``One good turtle deserves another'').
   ``It's insane,'' said Eastman, 26. ``Pete and I really had no
idea what we were unleashing. We were just two wild-eyed kids who
just wanted to do comic books.''
   They keep shop in a run-down building on a back street of this
college town.
   Eastman, then an occasional student at the University of
Massachusetts, said he tracked down Laird, who scraped out a living
by drawing illustrations for local newspapers, in 1982 because their
cartoons looked alike. They became fast friends, joined by a love
for Marvel Comics illustrator Jack Kirby.
   The turtles were created after what Eastman called a heavy dose
of ``T.J. Hooker'' and ``Love Boat'' at an apartment the two men
shared while Laird's fiancee finished her studies at the University
of New Hamsphire. Laird was still free-lancing cartoons. Eastman got
by making sandwiches at a restaurant.
   ``We had been watching a bunch of horrible TV and we started
drawing and throwing the stuff at each other,'' Eastman said last
week. ``We found we had this little beastie that we really fell in
love with.''
   The beast soon had three brothers, all named after Renaissance
painters, and a weird history involving a pool of goo in a New York
sewer and a rat with the powers of a Ninja master.
   As the story goes, the turtles were covered by the muck through a
random series of odd accidents. They mutated and grew up under the
rat's tutelage, evolving into superturtles with a taste for pizza
and for doing battle with the Shredder, leader of the most feared
assassins in Japan.
   Valentine considers the turtles the natural descendants of the
tin soldier with appealingly distasteful roots in radioactive gunk.
   ``Kids are into slime,'' he said. ``Anything to gross out their
little sisters.''
   Their creators scraped together $1,200 and printed 3,000 copies
of the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book. The comics
sold out in three weeks and Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo and
Raphael were propelled to fame on T-shirts, cereal boxes and
Saturday morning TV.
   Even avid fan Tom Selleck was filmed reading a turtles comic in
the farewell episode of ``Magnum, P.I.''
   ``It goes way beyond luck,'' Eastman said of their success. ``We
had one of the best black-and-white comics around. We worked hard to
get it to the point where Mark Freedman picked up on it.''
   Freedman, a New York licensing agent, managed to entice a
California company, Playmates, into investing $2.5 million in an
animated television show and launching a line of 10 figurines.
   The turtles were helped by the phenomenon of specialty comic book
stores that have sprung up in the last five years, which have opened
a market for the offbeat.
   ``Everybody says, `You guys must be zillionaires now.' Far from
it,'' said Eastman. He said, however, that the collaborators' annual
income is in the six figures and they now have eight artists working
on the comic strips and other ventures.
   The turtles have long since moved their comic book haunts from
the New York City sewers to the town where their creators have
settled.
   ``They can still get into the city easily from here,'' Eastman
said. ``And we can use people we know for characters.''
