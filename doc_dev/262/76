<HEAD>Ohio GOP Cartoonist Gets Boot For Work Resembling `Shoe'

   A cartoonist for the Ohio Republican Party
was fired after disclosure that some of his cartoons closely
resembled Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Jeff MacNelly's work.
   Ed Wilson, the cartoonist, was dismissed after a meeting by
state GOP officials who attended the Republican National Convention
in New Orleans. He was hired six weeks ago to draw cartoons
lampooning Democrats.
   ``Mr. Wilson has been dismissed, and an appropriate apology will
be forthcoming to Jeff MacNelly and his syndicate,'' Ohio
Republican Chairman Robert Bennett said Thursday night.
   The Dayton Daily News reported Thursday that several of Wilson's
cartoons are strikingly similar to those drawn by MacNelly, who
works for the Chicago Tribune.
   In his subsequent statement, Bennett said, ``It is clear that
some of Mr. Wilson's drawings are too similar to drawings by
another artist.''
   Dave Garick, the state party's communications director, said
Ohio GOP officials were disappointed over the incident because they
thought Wilson had a promising career.
   Neither Wilson nor MacNelly immediately responded to the firing.
Wilson had said earlier that the similarities are coincidental.
MacNelly had said he was considering turning the matter over to an
attorney.
   The Daily News reported that four cartoons drawn by Wilson for
the Ohio GOP are virtually the same as the MacNelly drawings,
except that the political figures have been changed to reflect
current politics. In two others, the artwork is strikingly similar,
but the subject matter is different, the newspaper said.
   One of MacNelly's cartoons shows President Jimmy Carter standing
in a trash can while he speaks at a podium. An adviser is saying,
``No. No. No. Stand ON your record not IN it. Now you've got it all
over your suit.''
   Wilson's cartoon features Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the Democratic presidential nominee, also standing in a trash can
behind a podium. A voice from the auditorium is saying, ``No. No.
No. Stand ON your record. Not IN it.''
   MacNelly has won three Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning.
His cartoons are syndicated by the Tribune Syndicate Co. and were
published in his 1984 book, ``Directions.'' He also draws the
syndicated comic strip, ``Shoe.''
   In the time he worked for the Ohio GOP, Wilson drew about 30
cartoons that were attached to news releases and, on at least two
occasions, handed out to the public.
   The similarities were found by Daily News staff artist Randy
Palmer, who saw some of Wilson's cartoons last weekend and compared
them with panels he saw in MacNelly's book, the newspaper said.
