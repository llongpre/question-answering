<DESCRIPT>  LETTER; SAN-JOSE; NEWSPAPER; CENSORSHIP; POLITICS; HUMOR  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  We abhor your decision to not publish the current "Doonesbury" comic strips,
which involve allegations of illegal drug use by Dan Quayle. You argue that
you are concerned only with fairness, but there is no suitable euphemism for
censorship.;   It is ridiculous to insist that the comic strips adhere to any
standard of reality. They are the comic strips. They are fiction. We do not
open the funnies to study politics; we are able to discern fact from fantasy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     More important, we think it is reprehensible that you have taken it upon
yourselves to prejudge whether Trudeau's strip is fair or conforms to any
other arbitrary standard. Political satire and parody are important American
traditions, expressions of the freedom that sets our country apart from all
other nations. Because of the controversy surrounding it, this "Doonesbury"
sequence is news in itself, and we would like to decide for ourselves its
merit.;   -- Kurt W. Freund; Twila Slesnick; Dublin; (hbox);   Your article
this morning on "Doonesbury" brought up some interesting thoughts about
censorship, credibility and the role of the newspaper. While I appreciate the
background on this Trudeau-Quayle controversy, there is one thing I will never
approve of: the censorship of any newspaper comic strip.;   I am outraged that
the Mercury News would allow itself to cater to the special interests of the
current administration. Regardless of the validity of Trudeau's claims, I
think the readers of this paper are entitled to see the strip as it was
intended without any censorship.;   -- Eric Predoehl; Sunnyvale; (hbox);   I
feel that an appropriate response would have been to provide your readership
with the facts (which you have done), but to run the pieces anyway. If Trudeau
wants to base his satire on statements whose authenticity is in question,
that's his business. After all, he's not writing for the history books.;   I'm
disappointed that you feel the need to filter the work of a well known and
usually respected political satirist, rather than educate your reading public.
I am perfectly able to distinguish between fiction and fact, and decide for
myself that Trudeau is blowing smoke.;   -- Jeff Nespor; Union City; (hbox);  
I thought you had a higher opinion of your readers than deciding for them what
they could read and therefore think about. I accept your explanation that the
basis for the strip is false -- your sources have been checked. Why can't I
still read the strip?;   Censorship -- really an exercise in arrogance. On you
it's unbecoming.;   -- Gary Letson; Los Altos; (hbox);   One of the reasons
given by you for not running the "Doonesbury" Quayle series was "we know it's
not true.";   I would like to know how you can be so sure that the allegations
of drug use and a cover-up by the Bush administration are false given the
scandalous, Machiavellian times in which we live. And if you are not
absolutely sure that all the allegations are false, how can you even begin to
justify this censorship?;   -- Mark Thomasee; Santa Clara; (hbox);   All of my
life, I've been under the impression that comic strips have been included in
newspapers as a fictional diversion, and were not meant to be held up to the
same semi-rigorous standards as front-page news.;   Unless Executive Editor
Bob Ingle is willing to assert that there really is a sentient beagle named
Snoopy who is able to fly a World War I triplane in the guise of the Red
Baron, I don't see how he can logically justify his blocking of a comic strip
he says a handful of journalists "know" to be "false.";   -- Michael Cassell;
Palo Alto; (hbox);   Well, I've heard Dan Quayle's opinion, and I've heard
Robert Ingle's opinion. Unfortunately I won't be hearing Garry Trudeau's
opinion, because you won't print it.;   -- Barry Holsinger; Sunnyvale; (hbox);
  Thank you, Mercury News, for protecting me from the current series of
"Doonesbury" strips. Without your guidance I may have had to think for myself.
I shudder to think of the consequences.;   -- Arlen Grossman; Monterey;
(hbox);   I had a lot of laughs listening to Dan Quayle taking a comic strip
so seriously. I snickered over the idea that some newspapers would not be
running "Doonesbury" because of its subject matter. I pictured these
newspapers running in communities where many of its readers had voted for
Jesse Helms or maybe even David Duke. It never occurred to me that the Mercury
News would be one of those papers.;   Who is it that can't tell the difference
between the front page and the comics page? Mercury News readers, or Mercury
News editors?;   -- Lynne Billig; Sunnyvale; (hbox);   I want to add my voice
to the loud cry of protest regarding the decision not to run the "Doonesbury"
comic strip. I feel that the decision was arrogant and politically motivated.;
  I feel that most readers of your publication are mature, well educated and
politically aware and are, therefore, entitled to make their own decision as
to whether or not a comic strip should be believed or disregarded. To decide
that we, the readers, cannot be trusted with this kind of satire is
paternalism of the worst kind.;   Each day in the Mercury News I read about
George Bush on the campaign trail. I see him pictured with school children
portraying him as the education president, pictured with political leaders
from all over the world portraying him as a great statesman, and pictured with
Pope John Paul II and other religious leaders portraying him as the peace
keeper.;   Apparently you trust my judgment in being able to weed the lies
from the truth in all those cases, but when it comes to a cartoon . . . Sir, I
resent the implication!;   -- Ruby Drobkiewicz; Milpitas; (hbox);   Doesn't
the Mercury News have the guts to print Garry Trudeau's comic strip on Dan
Quayle? You never gave in before when he wrote about something or someone
controversial. Why start now?;   -- Kathy Robertson; San Jose; (hbox);   The
Mercury News' decision not to run the "Doonesbury" Quayle series is a
particularly unfortunate one for free speech. I have enough faith in the good
sense and honesty of your editorial staff to believe your stated reasons. And
I understand your concern for fairness. Nonetheless, you've made a serious
error in your handling of this. Here's why:;   You could have just as easily
run the strip daily and accompanied it with your editorial position, either
the general view or a specific comment about the day's strip. That would have
been fair and responsible.;   -- Brooke W. Boering; Aptos; (hbox);   I think
you should run the Doonesbury series.;   Today you may live by censorship;
tomorrow you may die by it.;   -- David D. Spilker, M.D.; Pebble Beach  </TEXT>
