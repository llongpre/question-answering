<LEADPARA>  THERE appears to be some kind of new fad spreading among cartoonists. One by
one, they're taking time off.;    The latest to schedule a sabbatical is Bill
Watterson, creator of "Calvin and Hobbes," whose strip -- No. 1 in most reader
and critic polls -- appears in 1,800 newspapers. It is the fourth most widely
syndicated strip in the United States, according to Editor and Publisher.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The strip, which premiered in 1985, is in the second week of a nine-month
hiatus and will start again Feb. 1, 1992.;    Watterson isn't giving
interviews, but in a statement, he explained his decision to take some time
off:;    "Had I imagined 'Calvin and Hobbes' would last this long, I would
have paced myself. The strip requires a great deal of research, and I need to
do more interplanetary exploration and paleontology work before I continue."; 
  What's going on? Why is it that Garry Trudeau ("Doonesbury"), Berke Breathed
("Bloom County"), Gary Larson ("The Far Side"), Richard Guindon ("Guindon"),
Jerry van Amerongen ("The Neighborhood") and now Watterson have all put down
their pens for a while?;    A new phenomenon;  The old guard -- the likes of
Al Capp ("Li'l Abner"), Chester Gould ("Dick Tracy"), Chic Young ("Blondie")
and Charles Schulz ("Peanuts") -- never did that. Should they have? Is
creative burnout an occupational hazard? Or are modern cartoonists just
lazier?;    Dave Mruz, head of the Minnesota Cartoonist's League, said the
reason more cartoonists are taking a break is not irresponsibility but concern
for maintaining the quality of their work.;    "You're seeing cartoonists
becoming worried, saying they want to step back and take a look at it. The
work is so demanding that at some point you either become a horrible hack or
hire ghosts.";    The modern cartoonists -- at least those of the "Far Side"
and "Calvin and Hobbes" kind -- are more likely to have a one-to-one
relationship with their readers, Mruz said. To have somebody step in while the
cartoonist takes a vacation "would be almost totally sacrilegious to them.
They treat the characters as their own children.";    Watterson has strong
opinions on that intimate relationship with the reader. He directed a blast at
"schlock" cartoonists at a symposium on cartooning in 1989:;    "Why are so
many (cartoons) poorly drawn? Why do so many offer only the simplest
interchangeable gags and puns? Why are some strips written by committees and
drawn by assistants? Why are some strips still stumbling around decades after
their original creators have retired or died? Why are some strips little more
than advertisements for dolls and greeting cards? Why do so many comics look
the same?";    Rough pace;  Part of the answer might be in the pace at which
daily cartoonists work. Doing a seven-days-a-week strip is more than seven
days' worth of work, it's about nine days' worth, said Guindon. He works for
the Detroit Free Press and was syndicated in the early 1980s before taking a
year off.;    "It's like writing, producing and acting in a show all by
yourself, week in and week out," Guindon said. Contemporary cartoonists
"really insist on a standard for themselves," he said.;    "Once Chester Gould
(Dick Tracy) came up with those gimmicky names and faces, he probably felt OK
to live with that for the rest of his life." Al Capp had a staff to carry on
for him, Guindon said. "You could tell when he went on vacation because the
drawing would change.";    One of the few who has always done it all himself
is Schulz, Guindon said, but that's rare. "He makes a big point of not having
a staff.";    Desire to stay fresh;  Guindon said he sees honesty in taking
time off. "What has changed in our culture is that even when you're writing
the 'Mary Tyler Moore' show, after a time you've pretty much said it all."
That show is remembered partly for the fact that its producers dropped it
while it was still highly popular, saying they weren't able to remain fresh.; 
  "There is probably a beginning, a middle and an end for all enterprises. . .
. The figures in 'Gasoline Alley' changed, grew older, but few strips do
that," Guindon added.;    The sheer popularity of "Calvin and Hobbes" gives
Watterson the chance to take time off. A less-well-known cartoonist might be
told by the syndicate to stay at the drawing board.;    Said Lee Salem,
editorial director at Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes
"Doonesbury" and "The Far Side" as well as "Calvin and Hobbes," "If a creative
person comes to us and says he needs some time, we take the trouble to give
him that time." The popularity of Watterson's strip "obviously had some play"
in granting the request, Salem said.;    Yet it may remain a difference
between past and present. "I'm not going to say that if the strip was around
30 years ago the answer would have been 'yes,' " Salem said.  </TEXT>
