   A newspaper owner dropped the comic strip
``Cathy'' for criticizing George Bush and replaced it today with a
pro-Bush ad.
   Bob Bryan, publisher and owner of The Cullman Times and the
Athens News Courier, said Wednesday that he would pay for the
advertisement on the comics page.
   Bryan said he ``just took the panel out that would have been
`Cathy' and right where `Cathy' has been, put in big type `Vote For
Bush.''' After today, he said, he will replace ``Cathy'' with
another strip.
   The popular comic strip about a single working woman has been
running politically flavored episodes for more than a week. In them,
a friend of Cathy's is depicted as strongly criticizing the
Reagan-Bush administration.
   Several newspapers pulled installments of the strip, and at least
one other newspaper said last week that it was canceling ``Cathy''
altogether.
   Bryan said he believes the comic strip is no place for a
political message.
   ``I wouldn't have wanted the cartoonist or syndicate to endorse
Bush in the paper,'' he said.
   ``Cathy''' creator Cathy Guisewite said last week that ``it was
in keeping with the strip to comment on women's issues that are at
stake in this election.''
   Alan McDermott, managing editor for Universal Press Syndicate,
said Bryan had called to cancel ``Cathy.''
   He said 30 to 40 other representatives of newspapers have
contacted the Kansas City-based syndicate in the last two weeks to
express concern about the comic strip's political turn.
