   Tony award-winning actor Cleavon Little
has come to the Alabama Shakespeare Festival for preview
performances of a one-man play in which he portrays an elderly
sharecropper.
   Little, whose grandfather was a sharecropper, opens Wednesday in
``All God's Dangers,'' which is scheduled to run at the 17-year-old
festival through Oct. 1, and then move to New York.
   The play tells the story of Ned Cobb, who was born in 1885 in
Tallassee, 40 miles northeast of Montgomery, and transcended his
humble beginnings as a son of a former slave. Theodore Rosengarten,
who co-wrote the play with co-producers Michael Hadley and Hadley's
sister Jennifer, profiled Cobb under the pseudonym Nate Shaw in a
book on which the play is based.
   Little said the role is the greatest challenge of his career.
   ``I play an 85-year-old man, but I tell a number of different
stories and I become a number of different characters. I don't
change,'' said 50-year-old actor.
   ``(Shaw) becomes young at times, so the illusion I have to create
makes you want to forget he's old.''
   Little is probably best known for his role as the sheriff in the
Mel Brooks comedy ``Blazing Saddles.'' He won a Tony award for his
role as a rousing minister in ``Purlie'' and was nominated for a
Tony for his performance in ``I'm Not Rappaport.''

   Berke Breathed, who ended his ``Bloom
County'' comic strip last month, is enjoying his escape from daily
cartooning, which he calls ``a sponge on your imagination.''
   Breathed, who has a home in Evergreen, has a new, weekly comic
strip called ``Outland.'' In it, he said, ``I'm working in the
fantasy land of a little girl whose real life is less than real
easy. ... As `Outland' progresses, people will notice that the
landscape changes.''
   He said that may include backdrops that resemble Utah and
northern Arizona, locales that have been ``inspirations to me
artistically.''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Bloom County,'' which began in 1980
and featured such characters as Opus the penguin and Bill the Cat,
appeared in 543 daily newspapers. Breathed would draw a month's
worth of strips in just a few days, working around the clock.
   ``I realized I was aging much too fast,'' he said. ``I would be
remiss if I didn't admit that a tremendous load has been lifted off
my creative shoulders.''
   Now the cartoonist says he will have time to write a column for
``Boating'' magazine spoofing the hobby and to devote more time to
animal-rights organizations.

   Former Green Bay Packers coach Dan Devine and
former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White were among the players
at the third Tom Osborne Golf Classic.
   Professional golfer Bruce Crampton won the charity tournament
Monday as he birdied six of the last nine holes to finish with a
7-under-par 65. Fellow pro Gene Littler was second with 68.
   No prize money was at stake, tournament promoter Gunter Harz
said. The event raised money for Lee Elder's Kids, an Omaha group
organized against drugs; Omaha's alternate youth development
programs, which include summer work programs; and the American Lung
Association of Nebraska.
   About 600 people watched the tournament.
   Devine is a member of the White House Council for a Drug-Free
America, and White said he is organizing a group of ex-pro
quarterbacks to become active in drug prevention.
   ``We're a unique fraternity,'' White said of the group, which has
not yet adopted a name. ``We're trying to have a positive impact on
the reputation of pro athletes.''

   Nearly 15 years after fleeing the
crumbling Republic of South Vietnam, Nguyen Cao Ky, the former
dashing fighter pilot and premier, sees a role for himself in
postwar Vietnam's future.
   A bankruptcy five years ago shut down his Orange County liquor
business and he shouldered the burden of never-substantiated rumors
that he was kingpin of a Vietnamese organized crime clan.
   With those troubles behind him, he still commands admiration from
much of the expatriate Vietnamese community, many of whom approach
him at restaurants in Orange County's ``Little Saigon'' to swap war
stories or present their children to him.
   He said he returned recently from a trip to Asia, saying he is
serving as a consultant to governments and industry. He would not be
more specific.
   ``I don't want to be the first Vietnamese city councilman,'' he
said in an interview published Monday in the Orange County Register.
``I am a general, not a social worker.''
   Ky, who once tried to whip up support for military resistance to
North Vietnam, says that struggle is over. Instead, the United
States should use its economic clout to pressure the communists
toward reforms of the type going on in Poland, he said.
   To that end, he believes he might still have a role as loyal
opposition leader in his homeland. ``I am Asian. I believe in
destiny,'' he said.

   While British newspapers focus on
Princess Anne's broken marriage, the only daughter of Queen
Elizabeth II is concentrating on her duties as president of the Save
the Children Fund.
   The 39-year-old princess visited a government hospital in
Tegucigalpa on Monday as part of a two-week Latin American tour. She
also is scheduled to visit Bolivia and Ecuador before returning home
in mid-September.
   Anne, head of the International Equestrian Federation, was
attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in Puerto Rico
when Buckingham Palace announced Thursday that she was separated
from her husband, Mark Phillips, after 15 years of marriage.
   The palace said no divorce is planned but Anne will live at the
family home, Gatcombe Park, and Phillips, 40, will move to another
house in Gloucestershire.
