   Don Ameche, who is returning to Broadway this
week for the first time in 22 years, says he initially turned down
the lead role in ``Our Town,'' but changed his mind because ``it
would be fun to be back on stage.''
   The 80-year-old Academy Award-winning actor on Tuesday takes over
the role of Stage Manager in the play based on Thornton Wilder's
drama of a New England town.
   ``We don't have many American classics like this,'' Ameche told
The Associated Press.
   Ameche said he at first turned down the role but changed his mind.
   ``I thought it would be fun to be back on stage,'' said Ameche,
who is replacing Spalding Gray.
   Ameche said he doesn't expect to feel any jitters about returning
to Broadway, where he first appeared nearly 60 years ago in ``Jerry
for Short.''
   ``After more than two or three minutes, all that is gone,'' said
Ameche, whose recent films include ``Trading Places,'' and
``Cocoon,'' for which he received an Oscar.

   This week's broadcast of ``Peter Pan,'' which
hasn't been televised in more than 15 years, should bring back
painful memories to Mary Martin, who broke her elbow teaching
co-stars how to fly in the production.
   ``I started really fast and suddenly I'm out of sight, and I
don't feel anything pulling me back,'' Miss Martin, who portrayed
Peter in the 1960 movie, said in this week's People magazine. ``I'm
heading for the wall, and like a shot, I hit it.''
   Martin, now 75, broke her elbow in two places.
   She said the crewman who was supposed to pull her back was new
and ``so excited he forgot.''
   The story of the little boy who never wanted to grow up will be
broadcast on NBC-TV on Friday. It was last televised in 1973. After
that, the rights to the movie were held up for years by the 1979
Broadway revival with Sandy Duncan.

   You wouldn't know Donna Rice these days,
and that's exactly what she was hoping for when she bought the false
buck teeth and sunglasses she now wears in public.
   ``It's just been real hard,'' the model said Saturday in a speech
at the 15th annual Institute on the Ethics of Journalism at
Washington and Lee University. ``I do live in a state of having to
watch my every move. ... Imagine the kind of person you most dislike
and think of people thinking of you as that kind of person.''
   Ms. Rice's liaison with former Sen. Gary Hart destroyed the
Colordao Democrat's bid for the 1988 presidential nomination. Hart
withdrew from the race in May 1987.
   ``I basically lost everything I had worked for all of my life,''
she said _ her reputation and credibility as well as her livelihood.
   Ms. Rice said she frequently is recognized in public and has
tried to hide her appearance by pulling her hair back.
   In addition, she added. ``I have a disguise. I have buck teeth
that I put on. They cost me 80 bucks. You guys want to see?''
   When the audience said yes, Ms. Rice donned a pair of glasses,
bent over and inserted the false teeth. She stood upright, looking
like quite a different person.
   ``I hope,'' she said, ``time will eventually take care of all of
this.''

   Jane Fonda says actor Rob Lowe ought to be in
pictures _ particularly those of the campaign poster variety.
   ``He's a phenomenon, much like a young Frank Sinatra in the way
he works the women in the audience. ... He'd make a good
politician,'' Fonda said in April's Cosmopolitan magazine.
   Lowe, 25, rose to fame as part of the so-called brat pack of
young, new actors in films like ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``The
Outsiders,'' and ``About Last Night.''
   He also made a name for himself with a string of romances with
high-profile women like Princess Stephanie of Monaco and Fawn Hall,
ex-secretary to Oliver North, on trial for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.

   Cartoon cat Garfield, his creator Jim Davis
and Smokey the Bear with join Gov. Evan Bayh and 170 schoolchildren
in planting a tree on the Statehouse lawn on Arbor Day.
   Davis, an Indiana native, is the 1989 Arbor Day spokesman for the
Hoosier state.
   Davis, who also created the ``U.S. Acres'' comic strip, is a
member of the National Audubon Society, the National Wildlife
Federation and The Nature Conservancy.
   ``Now is the perfect time for all Hoosiers to contribute
something to their communities,'' Davis said in a statement. ``Plant
a tree, plan a celebration, do something fun for Arbor Day.''
   Arbor Day, the second Friday of each April, is set aside to
recognize and honor the benefits trees provide.
