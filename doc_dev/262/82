<TEXT>     Nonetheless, when we turned to the April 17 comics page and read yuppie
superwoman Sally Forth's weary response:;    "Are we talking about lovemaking
here, Ted?";    We couldn't help feeling a little embarrassed.;    Sex? In the
funny papers? We were used to seeing grizzled old perverts leer at scantily
clad women in "Beetle Bailey." But this was something different.;    Never
mind that Ted and Sal never got out of the kitchen. We knew things would never
be the same.;    And they weren't.;    Less than a week later, in "For Better
or Worse," John drank from a cup of milk that he discovered had been pumped
from his nursing wife's breast. And then Luann (a strip based on a neurotic
13-year-old) began to menstruate.;    The timing was purely coincidental, say
the cartoonists who draw the strips. But all three incidents are examples of a
movement toward realism on the comics pages.;    "It's a trend, not only in
the subject matter of the strips but in the type of strips that newspapers are
buying," says Jay Kennedy, comics editor of King Features, which distributes
"Sally Forth" and "Luann.";    "You're going to be seeing fewer funny animals,
fewer Peter Pan-type strips, less fantasy and more reality. People want to see
more characters that they can relate to.";    Greg Howard, the
Minneapolis-based cartoonist who draws "Sally Forth," says it seemed natural
for his characters to bemoan their lack of time together.;    "The situation
is one that married couples with children face, particularly if they are both
working," he said in a recent phone interview. "I guess I did have to think
about it a little bit. But I wasn't trying to stir up any trouble.";    And he
didn't, as far as he knows. He hasn't received any letters on the topic thus
far.;    The people who produce the nation's comics pages hope this is a sign
that the Church Lady-like standards they've been held to for decades are
relaxing a bit.;    "For years, the comics have been perceived as a medium for
children, which they are not, especially in dailies," complains Kennedy. "Only
the Sunday comics page truly has many readers who are children.";    Garry
Trudeau's "Doonesbury," which has dealt with AIDS and other adult themes in
recent years, has helped to chip away at that stereotype. So has "The
Simpsons," the silly but smart TV cartoon that appeals to both adults and
children.;    But there are some subjects that both adults and children ought
to be more open about, says Lynn Johnston, creator of the strip "For Better or
Worse.";    "The trouble right now is that everybody talks about bodily
functions and sex in an ugly, nasty, dirty way," Johnston said in a phone
interview from her home in North Bay, northern Ontario.;    Unlike strips such
as "Dennis the Menace," where the characters never age, Johnston has let her
characters simply live their lives in the 12 years she's drawn the strip. So
when Ellie gave birth a few weeks back, it seemed natural that she'd
breast-feed the new baby.;    "It's a very discreet, very warm, very pleasant
thing you see happening all the time," she says. "I nursed both my children
and I really enjoyed it, but I thought there were some funny aspects of it,
too.";    The misidentified cup of milk, for example. Or the upcoming strip in
which Ellie realizes she's developed lopsided breasts from nursing on one
side. And then there's the problem every nursing mother dreads: accidental
leakage.;    Johnston remembers wearing a red silk dress to a dance, only to
have her front soaked after someone mentioned the word "baby." She still
hasn't decided whether she'll use a similar scenario in the strip, though. "If
it's appropriate. If it works in. If it's funny.";    When Greg Evans, creator
of "Luann," was considering his menstruation series some months back, he sent
copies to Johnston.;    He wanted her feedback. And he was wondering whether
Johnston would address the issue with Elizabeth, her version of the neurotic
13-year-old.;    "I thought he handled it very well," she says. "But as far as
Elizabeth, I don't know. The characters sort of write the strip themselves."; 
  To tell the truth, Johnston is leery of having her two teen-age characters,
Elizabeth and Michael, do anything that might embarrass her own teen-age
daughter and son.;    "My son would be horrified if I showed Michael talking
to a girl about sex," she says.;    And she has enough trouble talking to her
daughter about the facts of life as it is. So Johnston leaves informational
books lying around and checks periodically to see if they've been moved.;   
It's a sad scenario, she admits.  </TEXT>
