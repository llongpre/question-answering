<LEADPARA>  THEY don't make superheroes like they used to, simply because they don't have
to make them up any more. Producers of animated children's television have the
real thing to draw on, and next fall they will draw with a vengeance.;   
Superstars Michael Jordan of the Bulls and Bo Jackson of the White Sox and Los
Angeles Raiders will join hockey legend Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings
in a Saturday morning cartoon series called "ProStars" for NBC. Not content
with sports heroes alone, the network also will bring Macaulay Culkin, who hit
a grand slam in the movie "Home Alone," into the schedule as the "Wishkid."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Animated incarnations of rapper M.C. Hammer (ABC's "Hammerman"), Michael J.
Fox and Christopher Lloyd (reprising "Back to the Future" for CBS) and Keanu
Reeves and Alex Winter ("Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures" for Fox, after
being dropped by CBS) also will highlight Saturday's fall schedule for kids.; 
  All four networks, which made pitches to potential sponsors in New York
earlier this month, will be pitting their animated characters from real life
against such fictional standbys as "Tom and Jerry," "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" and "Garfield," as they vie for pint-size viewers in the $305 million
children's TV advertising market.;    ABC, CBS and NBC face fierce competition
for the children's market from syndication and cable as well as Fox, in what
Jenny Trias, vice president of children's programming for ABC, called "a
market that seemingly cannot get any tighter.";    The search for that one
overnight hit will bring a flock of new shows, animated and otherwise, to the
Saturday morning lineup. Here is a rundown:;  ABC;  "Land of the Lost," a
live-action adventure that begins when a father and his two children are
caught in an earthquake that plunges them into a bizarre subterranean world
inhabited by dinosaurs.;    "Darkwing Duck," an animated Disney duck battles a
wide range of villains as a self-promoting superhero.;    "Hammerman," the
animated adventures of Stanley Kirk Burrell (M.C. Hammer's real name), whose
dream of becoming a rap-music star is enhanced by the gift of a pair of "Magic
Dancin' Shoes.";    "The Pirates of Dark Water" premiered as an animated
miniseries this season and recounts the adventures of a young hero and heroine
as they battle evil pirates in search of the treasure that will save their
dying planet.;     CBS;  "Riders in the Sky," with the cowboy trio of the same
name as hosts, wraps bygone echoes of Gene Autry and the Riders of the Purple
Sage around a Western showcase of clay animation and puppetry.;    "Mother
Goose and Grimm," based on the comic strip, stars Mother Goose as the harried
mistress of Atilla, a paranoid cat; Ham, a whiny pig; and Grimmy, a madcap pit
bull who dines from trash cans and drinks out of the toilet.;    "Back to the
Future," the animated version of the team of Emmett "Doc" Brown and Marty
McFly, based on the movie trilogy.;    "Where's Waldo," stars Waldo and his
dog, Woof, from the best-selling children's book in history in an adventure
series with interactive segments challenging children to find the hero in a
crowd of eccentric characters.;     NBC;  "Chip &amp; Pepper's Surf's Up
Saturday," with the Canadian teen-idol twins as hosts, is a showcase for
animation and celebrity interviews.;    "Yo, Yogi!" stars Yogi Bear, Boo Boo,
Snagglepuss and Huckleberry Hound in an updated version based in a
state-of-the-art shopping mall.;    "ProStars" pits the animated incarnations
of Bo Jackson, Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky against evil-doers, with video
wraparounds by the sports heroes.;    "Wishkid, Starring Macaulay Culkin" is
the animated version of the "Home Alone" kid, whose adventures are expedited
by the grant of one wish a week.;     FOX;  "Space Cats," from "Alf" creator
Paul Fusco, brings an alien race of cats to earth where they go undercover
among ordinary felines and fight evil.;    "Tazmania" is the animated
adventures of the "Looney Tunes" Tazmanian Devil, a frenetic eating machine
from Down Under.;    "Little Shop," starring a rap-happy man-eating plant from
outer space and its nemesis, Dr. Toxic, is based on the film, "Little Shop of
Horrors.";    "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures," based on the movie, sends
the two party animals via phone booth on a wild series of trips in and out of
this world. (box)  </TEXT>
