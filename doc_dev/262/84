<LEADPARA>  'SALLY Forth" has a new look. Greg Howard, the comic strip's creator, has
hired a professional illustrator to draw the popular feature and "elevate" its
artistic level. But now some readers miss the freehand, almost intentionally
crude style in which Howard drew Sally, her family and her sexist boss.;   Why
did Howard make the change?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I've always gotten complaints about my drawing," he says. "Editors have
refused to buy the strip because of my drawing. People have written and said,
'I kind of like your strip, but you can't draw.' And now I'm finding there
were a fair number of people out there who liked my art style.;   "I'm a
writer who forced himself to draw a little bit and I worked myself up to
mediocre over the years," he confesses. "But I have some fairly serious
artistic limitations.";   His new collaborator is Craig MacIntosh, an
editorial illustrator for the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Howard says they are
now "tinkering" with the strip's style to bring it somewhat more in line with
what-used-to-be.;   A spokeswoman for North American Syndicate, the strip's
distributor, acknowledges the change has generated both criticism and support.
"We're still tabulating calls," says Karen Moy, assistant to the comics
editor. If enough people complain, she adds, the syndicate may revisit the
matter with Howard.  </TEXT>
