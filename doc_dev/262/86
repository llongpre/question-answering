   Cartoonist Gary Larson, whose ``The Far
Side'' comic appears in more than 800 newspapers, will take a
14-month break from his work beginning this fall, his syndicate
said Saturday.
   ``Even revolutionaries need to refuel,'' Universal Press
Syndicate president John McMeel said.
   Larson, 38, who lives in Seattle, will stop distributing new
cartoons Oct. 30 and will begin again Jan. 1, 1990.
   Larson, who has said in the past that he sits down at his
drawing table and ``gets silly,'' is famous for cartoons about cows
that honk at humans, dinosaurs that smoke and woman with beehive
hairdos.
   In one cartoon showing a step in evolution, three fish, one
carrying a baseball bat, prepare to step from the sea for the first
time to retrieve a baseball sitting on the shore.
   In another, a rattlesnake with a pointer in its mouth lectures a
class of other snakes, showing them a chart of a man's leg with a
boot. The bare part of the leg is marked ``OK,'' and the boot is
marked ``No good.''
   During Larson's hiatus, Universal Press will distribute more
than 1,000 cartoons he drew in the early 1980s and that were
published in about 30 newspapers, McMeel said.
   ``Selections from this earlier material will be made available
for the 14-month leave,'' McMeel said, including six black and
white cartoons a week and a color strip on Sunday.
   During his time off, Larson wants to rest and travel, said
spokeswoman Diane Galante. She said he currently is on a trip
outside the country.
   A collection of Larson's cartoons organized by the Smithsonian's
Natural History Museum has been touring U.S. museums the last two
years and collections of his cartoons have consistently been on the
best-selling charts.
   In 1983, another Universal Press cartoonist, Garry Trudeau, took
a 21-month leave from his ``Doonesbury'' strip to update his
characters and work on a Broadway play.
   The syndicate, based in Kansas City, also distributes the
cartoons ``Cathy,'' ``Calvin and Hobbes,'' and ``Ziggy,'' and
several columnists including Dear Abby.
