   Cartoonist Berke Breathed stepped away from comic
pages, where his Opus the penguin has been searching animal testing
laboratories for his long-lost mother, and into a fur-protest march.
   ``This is the first time I've made the dangerous foray into
personal participation. I believe it's a less transient issue than
most, which is why I'm involved,'' Breathed said Saturday.
   ``A good place to start is trying to get people to stop wearing
furs,'' he said.
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, leading a crowd of nearly
400 through a pedestrian mall, carried a sign picturing a hunter
standing on a wolf's neck. The crowd chanted ``Shame on you'' at
shoppers sporting furs.
   Opus' odyssey through the laboratories of a cosmetic company
laboratories in Breathed's nationally syndicated comic strip,
``Bloom County,'' prompted a number of newspapers to pull the strip
during the series, which ran last month.
   ``It was as divisive as if I had been writing about abortion,''
Breathed said.

   Country comedian Minnie Pearl, who has
undergone two operations for breast cancer, was honored by the
Nashville Academy of Medicine for her work to promote cancer
awareness.
   ``I do admire you,'' the Grand Ole Opry star, whose real name is
Sarah Cannon, told about 300 doctors Saturday night as she accepted
the academy's Community Service Award.
   ``Being a doctor is one of the greatest things that can happen to
a man or a woman. I could never achieve that status because I'm not
smart enough. All I could do was be a clown,'' Mrs. Cannon said.
   ``Some wonderful doctors took good care of me when I had breast
cancer. I'm glad I got this award because it gives me the
opportunity to say all these things.''
   Mrs. Cannon had two separate mastectomies and reconstructive
surgery in 1985. Since then, she has encouraged other women to pay
closer attention to signs of breast cancer.

   Oprah Winfrey hasn't come over to
borrow a cup of sugar _ or even a few packets of artificial
sweetener _ since she moved in down the road, but Ron LaPage says
she's welcome.
   ``We'd invite her in and even give her a beer. We don't have
nothing fancy, but she's welcome to come to our house,'' LaPage
said. ``We want to meet that woman.''
   Just down County Road 600E is a drive lined with pines. At the
end of it sits the weekend house of the millionaire television talk
show host. The entry to the large sandy-colored chateau opens into a
medieval-style turret peaked with a spire.
   The brick home, about 65 miles east of Chicago, graces 160 acres
of land, complete with two-car garage, swimming pool, tennis court
and horse stable. The groundskeeper's house has its own two-car
garage.
   The Rev. David Verhalen, who lives along road 600E, had a brief
chat with his new neighbor, who mostly keeps to herself.
   ``I've seen her a couple of times jogging down the road,'' said
the Roman Catholic priest. ``One time I said, `Hi, how are you
doing?' She said: `Fine, how are you?' _ something like that. She
seemed to be very friendly.''

   William Hurt, who has spent the past
decade racking up movie successes, says he's in the middle of a
transformation like the character he portrays in his latest film,
``The Accidental Tourist.''
   ``I am ready for a fuller, more complete relationship with
people,'' Hurt said in an interview with The Sunday Tennessean. ``It
doesn't worry me so much for people to find out who I am.''
   Hurt, who has gained a reputation as a reticent interviewee, said
he had come a long way from the brooding introvert he was a few
years ago. He also said he stopped drinking two years ago, ``but
I've tried to avoid becoming Mr. AA. That would be the worst thing
that could happen to my sobriety.''
   ``So many things were right about this film,'' he said, giving
his relationship with director Lawrence Kasdan credit for some of
his satisfaction. The two also worked together on ``The Big Chill.''
   ``The film also stars Kathleen Turner and Geena Davis.
   In ``The Accidental Tourist,'' which also stars Kathleen Turner
and Geena Davis, Hurt plays a travel writer whose world comes apart
when his 12-year-old son dies and his marriage collapses. His life
is restored through his relationship with a ditzy dog trainer,
played by Davis.

   Opera singer Kallen Esperian of Memphis
says she was scared to death the first time she sang with the
legendary Luciano Pavarotti, but discovered the celebrated tenor is
``no prima donna.''
   The 27-year-old soprano makes her national television debut
Monday with Pavarotti on ``Live From Lincoln Center'' in an episode
called ``Pavarotti Plus! ... Plus!''
   ``The first time I sang with him, I was scared to death,'' she
said in a recent interview. ``To be included with him, to be able to
sing on the same stage with him is overwhelming. And as I got to
know him, I realized there's no prima donna stuff going on up there,
no temperament. I'm just happy he enjoys singing with me.''
   Miss Esperian, who will soon debut with the Metropolitan Opera,
and Pavarotti sing a duet from Guiseppe Verdi's ``La Traviata.''
