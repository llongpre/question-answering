<LEADPARA>  EVERY day, hundreds of thousands of American newspaper readers turn eagerly to
find out what's happening to policeman Joe Cobb and his wife, Marcy, a nurse
-- the featured characters in the comic strip "Jump Start.";    Unlike most
comic-strip heroes, the Cobbs are black. So is Robb Armstrong, 28, creator of
"Jump Start" and one of only four black syndicated cartoonists in the country.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "There is nothing so gratifying as doing something creative with your life,
doing something completely original, something that never existed before, and
being responsible for it," Armstrong says in an interview in his studio,
located in his mother-in-law's modest home in this Philadelphia suburb.;   
Lifetime dream;  Having his comic strip syndicated in many of the largest
newspapers in the nation (including the Mercury News) "is mind-boggling," he
says. "It's the dream of my life, something I wanted to do ever since I was a
little kid.";    "Jump Start" debuted Oct. 2, 1989, in 40 newspapers. Now, 16
months later, the strip is carried in 80 papers. Small publications pay as
little as $8 a week and large ones as much as $100 a week for "Jump Start,"
with United Features Syndicate, which distributes the strip, and Armstrong
dividing the money.;    Long-shot odds;  "The odds of becoming a syndicated
comic-strip cartoonist are like the odds in a lottery," Armstrong says. "Every
year, the six large syndicates that distribute comic strips in America receive
as many as 10,000 proposed panels and strips. Five to 10 are purchased." (In
total, about 300 cartoonists are syndicated.);    The other syndicated strips
by blacks are "Wee Pals" by Morrie Turner, "Curtis" by Ray Billingsley and
"Herb and Jamaal" by Stephen Bentley. Billingsley's strip is the most widely
distributed, running in about 200 newspapers.;    Unlike many white
cartoonists, Armstrong says, he and "the other black comic-strip cartoonists
walk on eggs. In one popular strip, for example, a white cartoon character
daily staggers in and out of a saloon. He's abusive to his wife. I could never
do anything like that.";    He adds, "Joe and Marcy Cobb represent the
behavior of black people. I avoid any negative stereotypes. The characters are
black, but they have universal appeal. Human behavior is human behavior. I key
in on humorous things people do day to day that people recognize and laugh at,
mundane things funny to everybody.";    Armstrong, the youngest of five
children, grew up in a poor section of West Philadelphia. His parents divorced
when he was young.;    "My mother (who died nine years ago) worked hard doing
her best to assure her children had a decent life," he says. "She was a
seamstress with her own business out of the basement of our house.";    He
started drawing cartoons when he was 5. "I was totally enamored of comic
strips," he says. "They taught me to read. I was anxious to learn what those
characters were saying. I have a debt to Charles Schulz. 'Peanuts' got me
going. My first drawings were of Charlie Brown and Snoopy.";    By the time he
enrolled at Syracuse University, Armstrong was a veteran cartoonist, and the
campus paper, the Daily Orange, ran his comic strip "Hector" for four years.
It featured Hector, an overweight militant college student; his friend
Meatball; and Julius, "a dog with human ears.";    While an advertising major
at Syracuse, he also met Sherry West, a fashion designer whom he married five
years ago.;    For four years after he graduated from college in 1985,
Armstrong submitted proposed strips to syndicates. At first, he sent along the
best of "Hector," "but the syndicates wanted something with broader appeal
than a college student," he says.;    He introduced Hector's father into the
strip and gave him a job as a police officer. Later, he made the father the
central character. About two years ago, Sarah Gillespie, a comic-strip editor
at United Features Syndicate, saw possibilities in Armstrong's creation.
Gillespie, who is still Armstrong's editor, met with the young cartoonist and
suggested he make the policeman his age and married so the strip would be
personally relevant.;    Armstrong draws "Jump Start" in his studio at night
after he returns home from a 9-to-5 job as an art director for the Weightman
Group, the largest art agency in Philadelphia.;    At the art agency Armstrong
comes up with ideas for TV commercials, including Alpo dog food and Scott
bathroom tissue.;    "To be around all the hustle and bustle and experiencing
life out there is important for 'Jump Start,' " he says. "It keeps me in tune
with what's going on outside my studio."  </TEXT>
