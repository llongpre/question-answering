   The Dallas Times Herald won a round in its legal battle with rival Dallas Morning News over rights to publish the comic strip Doonesbury and other features syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, based in Kansas City, Mo. 

   A state district judge here granted the Times Herald a temporary restraining order barring the Morning News from publishing 26 comic strips and columns that the Times Herald has been purchasing from the syndicate. 
Universal Press has filed a related suit against the Times Herald in U.S. District Court in Kansas City. 

   Underlying the dispute is a planned joint venture between A.H. Belo Corp., parent of the Morning News, and Universal Press. 
The venture is intended to explore electronic media possibilities for Universal's features. 
But the agreement also gives Belo exclusive rights to Universal Press features for the Morning News, the city's largest paper, starting Sept. 3. 
As a result, Universal notified the Times Herald that it could no longer run 26 features, including the Dear Abby and Erma Bombeck columns and The Far Side, a popular comic strip. 

   The Times Herald, which is owned by DTH Media Inc., sued Belo, Universal Press and the Morning News in state court in Houston on Aug. 7, charging interference with a contract and unfair competition. 
State District Judge David West on Monday temporarily barred the Morning News from going ahead with its publication plans, ruling that there is a significant probability the Times Herald would be irreparably harmed by such an action. 

   Still pending is the suit in Kansas City, in which Universal Press is seeking a similar order barring the Times Herald from publishing the 26 features beginning Sept. 3. 
It is seeking the order on grounds that its copyright on the features would be violated.
