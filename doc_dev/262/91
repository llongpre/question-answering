   Clark Kent, the mild-mannered reporter who heads
for phone booths when he smells trouble, has become more of a
yuppie lately, says a comic book artist who drew Superman for more
than 25 years.
   The appraisal came from Curt Swan, 68, at Friday's 50th
anniversary party for the comic book character.
   Kent, Superman's alter ego, was initially portrayed as a
``milquetoast, sweet, timid'' man, Swan said. But he is now often
portrayed by other illustrators as more of a yuppie, with tailored
suits and a muscular physique.
   ``He wears high-fashion clothes,'' Swan said, adding that he
prefers the old Kent.
   The character of Superman, though, has remained relatively
unchanged over the years, he said.
   Some of the hundreds of people who attended the party, including
10-year-old Danny Williams of Greenwich, Conn., said they like it
that way.
   ``He's a hero. He's so strong. He flies and he's a legend,''
Williams said as he watched TV clips of Superman.
   The party, staged by DC Comics, the comic-book publisher that
introduced the cartoon character in June 1938, drew children and
adults fascinated with the Man of Steel, impervious to all but the
disabling substance kryptonite.
   ``I came from a world that no longer exists. Men would call me
Superman,'' came a voice through loudspeakers as the crowd was
treated to a slide show, replays of original radio programs and a
sound and light show.
   The party included a smoke-filled, tunnel-like hallway
supposedly made of the fictitious kryptonite. Some children
hesitated, scared to walk through.
   Superman was actually created in 1933, when two high school boys
from Cleveland _ Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster _ depicted a man who
could bend steel with his bare hands.
   It took until 1937 for Siegel, the writer, and Shuster, the
illustrator, to sell their idea to a man who needed a fresh new
lead character in a new comic book. The first issue sold hundreds
of thousands of copies.
   Through the years, Superman's daring rescues and battles against
evil have been chronicled in hundreds of newspaper funny pages, a
radio serial, a TV series and movies.
   The cast of characters includes reporter Lois Lane, his
perennial heartthrob, eager-beaver cub reporter Jimmy Olsen and
Perry White, blustering editor of the Daily Planet.
   A yearlong celebration of Superman, which will continue through
June, features an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History, the release of the movie
``Superman IV,'' a prime-time CBS special and the unveiling of a
statue celebrating Superman and his creators.
   Superman over the years has ``become part of the culture all
over the world,'' said Paul Levitz, executive vice president of DC
Comics.
   ``There was a period a few years ago where we were selling more
comic books in Germany than in the United States,'' he said. ``The
basic myth of the character touches everyone. We'd all like to
think that within the Clark Kent we all are there is the Superman
inside.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he wished there ``were a Superman I
could have in the city to protect us from crime.''
   ``I like Superman comics. I used to read them when I was a kid.
My father said it was junk,'' said Dorothy A. Puzo, a movie
director and writer whose father, the novelist Mario Puzo, wrote
screenplays for two Superman movies.
