   George Bush says he no longer fumes
when he's ridiculed in the comic strip ``Doonesbury'' or on the
television comedy show ``Saturday Night Live,'' but his mother
still does.
   ``She's 87. She doesn't like it when people say things that are
untrue about her little boy,'' the vice president said.
   Speaking to a group of reporters in Idaho while on a campaign
trip through the West, Bush said he ``used to get very tense'' with
Doonesbury strips, Saturday Night Live skits and other biting humor
done at his expense.
   ``It doesn't bother me any more. You know why? The American
people doesn't believe it. So why should I be uptight?''
   Bush, who says he ``doesn't understand Doonesbury even when it's
about me,'' has no reservations about returning fire against the
comic strip or its creator, G.B. Trudeau.
   ``Doonesbury! My God, he speaks for a bunch of brie-tasting,
chardonnay-sipping elitists,'' Bush said without further
elaboration.
   Bush seemed to forget that he and the comic strip's creator have
something elite in common _ they both graduated from the Ivy
League's Yale University.

   Speaking to an auditorium full of students at the College of
Southern Idaho in Twin Falls, Bush made a verbal stumble that
brought down the house.
   The vice president was expounding on his close relationship with
President Reagan.
   ``For seven and a half years I've worked alongside him and I'm
proud to be his partner. We've had triumphs, we've made mistakes,
we've had sex ...''
   ``Setbacks,'' Bush corrected quickly. ``We've had setbacks.''
   After the laughter subsided, Bush, red-faced, told his audience:
``I feel like the javelin competitor who won the toss and elected
to receive.''

   During a recent visit to a high school in Los Angeles, Bush was
asked by a reporter for his views on evolution, and whether
``creationism,'' a religious theory on the origins of mankind,
should be taught along with it. A big question but Bush, who says
he wants to be known as ``the education president,'' had a short
answer.
   ``I haven't given it any thought at all,'' he said.
