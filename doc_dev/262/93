   President Bush jokingly pronounced himself
furious Tuesday with senior White House aides for posing for a gag
photo, straight from the Doonesbury comic strip, depicting the
president as an invisible leader.
   The photo's inscription read: ``To President Skippy. From the
gang that sees through you.''
   Waving the picture round in mock anger, Bush said it should have
read, ``The gang that used to work here.''
   The picture showed Chief of Staff John Sununu, National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Deputy National Security Adviser Robert
Gates and a fourth, unidentified person sitting around Bush's desk
in the Oval Office, staring at an empty chair.
   ``I'm furious at him,'' Bush said of White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, even though Fitzwater was not in the picture.
``Just take a look. Read the inscription.''
   He quipped, ``This is a vicious assault on my presidency.''
   Bush is a frequent target of criticism from Doonesbury's
creator, Garry Trudeau. Lampooning Bush, Trudeau pictures the
president as being invisible and portrays his imaginary, evil twin
brother known as ``Skippy.''
   Bush has made no secret that he's no fan of Trudeau. The artist
was excluded from the invitation list when Bush invited cartoonists
to lunch.
   Bush's brief appearance in the White House press room caused a
stampede of cameramen and photographers. The president retreated
from the room when reporters tried to turn it into a question and
answer session.
