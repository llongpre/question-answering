<HEAD>Fox Adds `Comic Strip' for `Against the Law,' Puts `DEA' In Hiatus</HEAD>

   The standup comedy show ``Comic Strip Live''
will replace ``Against the Law'' on Fox Broadcasting Co. on Sunday
nights, and the police drama ``DEA'' is temporarily leaving the
air, the network said Tuesday.
   ``Against the Law,'' the low-rated but critically praised
courtroom drama, will replace ``DEA'' in its 9 p.m. EST Friday time
slot on Nov. 16, and ``DEA'' will return later this season, Fox
said.
   ``We think this move will help our schedule on Fox's most
important night,'' said Peter Chernin, president of the Fox
Entertainment Group. ``The viewers have told us that they want and
expect comedy from us on Sunday nights.''
   ``Comic Strip Live'' outperformed ``Against the Law'' in two
Sunday night tryouts earlier this season, Fox executives noted.
   The standup comedy show will continue to air on late night
Saturday, retitled as ``Comic Strip: Late Night,'' Fox said.
