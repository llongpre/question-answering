<HEAD>Garry Trudeau: I Told Jane to Walk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau says he urged
wife Jane Pauley to ``walk away from NBC altogether'' when she was
edged off the ``Today'' show in favor of Deborah Norville.
   Trudeau wanted to satirize the morning program in his irreverent
comic strip because ``it had a formal, Kabuki-like quality ... that
would have been a natural for me,'' he said in a rare interview in
the Oct. 15 issue of Newsweek magazine.
   But Pauley's broadcast career appears, in retrospect, to have
benefited from her move. And Trudeau says writing about his own
family in his comic strip would be ``a violation (as well as)
infinitely banal.''
   Pauley has wrestled with the same conflict between public and
private lives. She told People magazine last week that she'd love
to interview her husband, ``but a) he would never do it, and b) I
would not ultimately do it. But I know it's a neat story.''
   Trudeau said he decided to talk with Newsweek to commemorate the
20th anniversary of the strip's syndication. He wisely chose a
magazine - Pauley had told People she'd ``be really irritated'' if
he did an interview with a rival television network.
