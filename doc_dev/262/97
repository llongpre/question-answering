<LEADPARA>  TO CONFESS a slight personal bias from the start, I'd estimate there are
10,000 Americans, maybe 20,000, I would vote for before I'd vote for Dan
Quayle for president.;   Quayle, in my biased view, is a wind-up politician
plopped in the vice president's office on a whim, a privileged man whose
family wealth and influence disconnected him from American life as it's really
lived, a partisan conservative whose political philosophy got to him
pre-cooked. To confess another bias, newspaper reporting and writing is the
life I chose and would choose again.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     All that said, it can also be said that Quayle has been victimized by the
newspaper editors and publishers who've chosen to print episodes of a
satirical political comic strip whose running suggestion is that Quayle bought
and used illegal drugs.;   Those editors and publishers and others who don't
even use the Garry Trudeau "Doonesbury" strip share a guilt of complicity.
They ignore the raw unfairness in publication of accusations without proof or
join in the Trudeau pretext that it's really about a "cover-up.";   There are
even those in the newspaper business who insist they'll have no part of
"censorship" or violation of Trudeau's First Amendment rights. They hide in a
hypocrisy, knowing each day's work requires decisions on what news articles
and features will be used, work that doesn't make them censors.;   There's
other cowardice more evident here, that of editors and publishers who blink at
a gross unfairness and character assassination because Quayle is a most
convenient and libel-proof target and his attacker is the darling of
know-nothing conventional wisdom of the left.;   Whatever misdemeanors of
empty headedness and blow-dried intellect Quayle might be accused of, the
comic strip charges a serious crime, not only lacking proof but in the face of
federal investigators' statements that no proof exists.;   Trudeau appears to
have combined two episodes in which drug criminals claimed to have seen or
supplied Quayle with drugs. One informant, who said it happened in 1982, long
ago admitted that he'd made up a story to impress friends.;   The other
informant, whose story came out during the 1988 campaign, claimed to have sold
drugs to Quayle in the early 1970s, while Quayle was in law school.;   This
informant, serving a 50-year federal sentence for drug smuggling and bombing
offenses, claims he's been prevented from talking to reporters and a federal
judge has ruled his complaint against prison officials should be heard.;   In
Trudeau's "Doonesbury" treatment, there's a federal "cover-up" of Quayle's
"file" in the Drug Enforcement Administration. It's said by one character that
"the file didn't actually surface until late in the '88 campaign.";   It's
convenient to Trudeau's art to suggest the dark purpose in "Doonesbury," that
the DEA "file" of the unfounded 1982 allegation against Quayle has been
"covered up" to prevent the long-term drug smuggler and bomber from telling
his story about drug sales in the 1970s.;   It's said "Doonesbury" is only a
comic strip and where's the harm in suggesting -- under the license of fun and
fantasy -- that Quayle bought and used illegal drugs.;   The harm is that
Trudeau's work isn't only a comic strip. It's nationally recognized as biting
political satire and it succeeds because it's believed there's truth or bits
of truth in "Doonesbury.";   Trudeau can be excused for the lies about Quayle.
He's an artist and a satirist and he's got adoring fans. But they don't edit
him. That's what editors and publishers ought to be doing. It's their
responsibility to the newspaper business.  </TEXT>
