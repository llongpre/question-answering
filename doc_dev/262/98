   ``Bloom County'' was 25 years behind the
times in a comic strip satirizing ``flesh''-colored crayons as part
of a ``Crayola-Republican conspiracy.''
   The strip by Berke Breathed on Thursday depicted a black child
pondering a ``flesh''-colored Crayola crayon while drawing a
self-portrait.
   There hasn't been a Crayola crayon called ``flesh'' since 1963,
said the manufacturer, Binney &amp; Smith Inc. The company said it
changed the name of the color to ``peach,'' partially as a result of
the civil rights movement.
   Company spokesman Brad Drexler said the change ``was really our
people saying, `Look, the description of flesh really isn't
accurate.'''
   Spokeswoman Suzanne Whelton of The Washington Post Writers Group,
which syndicates ``Bloom County,'' said the point of the strip was
to lampoon commercial definitions of ``flesh'' color.
