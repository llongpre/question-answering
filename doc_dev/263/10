Captive insurance

'The traditional marketplace for insurance is in turmoil. Lloyd's is under
severe pressure; some providers are withdrawing from the marketplace;
reinsurance capacity is under strain - if not withdrawn - and in some lines
of business prices are on an upward spiral. The rapidity of such
environmental change verges on the unprecedented, yet in its face the
marketplace for the captive, in satisfying a niche insurance need, has been
upwardly mobile.'
THIS ASSESSMENT comes from Dr Bill Hastings, the Isle of Man's insurance
supervisor.
Manx-based captive insurance companies continue to increase in numbers,
currently 117, and Dr Hastings and the industry feel there is much potential
for further expansion.
A captive is a wholly-owned subsidiary that ensures some or all of its
parent's risks. It may be administered by its own staff or by a captive
management company.
Captive insurance companies are recognised as being a more economically
efficient method of insuring corporate risks, and generally produce better
risk management within the parent. By placing them offshore, the company
also benefits from a low-tax regime.
The parent eliminates brokerage commission and can raise cover on some risks
that are difficult to place in the normal market.
'Management is increasingly aware of the economic benefits that such a
subsidiary brings to bear upon its organisation,' said Dr Hastings. 'Closer
lines of communication and a richer identification by management with what
is a rightful management tool can only enhance the control of risk and
thereby wealth.
'Beneficial awareness by management, the increasing pervasiveness of risk
and the failure of traditional market places to satisfy niche needs mean
that the demand by parents to form such insurers from traditional areas such
as the UK will continue - and worldwide.'
The island was particularly pleased last year to welcome the first captive
to come out of the former USSR. This was the Northern Shipping Insurance
Company. Its parent is the Northern Shipping Company of Archangel, which has
a fleet of about 130 ships.
This captive will provide hull and machinery insurance for Northern.
Previously, the Soviet mInistry of merchant marine met the cost of damage or
loss to the companies' ships. But the changes in that part of the world
meant that shipping companies had to look elsewhere for cover.
The captive is managed by Isle of Man Insurance Management; and Mr Peter
Vick, a director, regarded it as an exciting development which opened up
possibilities for further business from that part of the world.
Within a few months, a second captive from the former USSR, Baltic Shipping,
was formed under management by Isle of Man Insurance. A third, Azov, is
expected shortly.
There are 27 managers in the Isle of Man, including major companies, such as
Sedgwick, Willis Coroon, Alexander and Bowring. Managers feel there are
still many UK companies that could form captives, but also expect the
continental Europeans to begin to recognise the advantage of having their
own insurance company. The experience and expertise exists within the
island's financial services community to handle more captives than are
currently registered there.
The diversity of financial services available in the island add to its
attraction as a location for captives. All the ancillary needs of a company
can be met there.
'There can be no doubt, worldwide awareness is on an upward surge,' said Dr
Hastings. 'Significant maturing of attitude is to be found in many foreign
jurisdictions; demand is on the increase, and in response we find many more
potential offshore jurisdictions entering the arena.
'The danger in such growth, of course, is one of dilution, and it is for
this very reason that the Isle of Man will seek not only to retain its
forward position but also to set the trend.'
