(5): Room for expansion - Isle Of Man

THE Isle of Man finance industry is very buoyant and, with plenty of space
available for expansion, the island expects considerable growth in that
sector over the next few years. The strict regulatory framework, built over
the past eight years, is regarded by Manx-based institutions as helpful
rather than onerous.
The industry and the Manx government are monitoring developments of the
single European market, but more with a view to spotting potential for
business rather than through fear of loss of business.
The Isle of Man, which has its own parliament, is not a full member of the
EC, but as a crown dependency of the UK has a special relationship with it.
It can export certain products, not financial, into the EC but is not
eligible for grant aid.
Most island-based institutions have felt no need to be situated inside the
EC boundaries. However, Clerical Medical and Target International have
opened Luxembourg offices in addition to their bank space to comply with EC
regulations that required fund administration to be in situ. Barclays
Unicorn moved its operation from the island to consolidate all its offshore
work in Luxembourg.
The island's financial industry and its attitude to business have changed
considerably in the past decade. In the seventies and early eighties naivety
and an urgent need for economic expansion left the island open to the ploys
of dubious entrepreneurs and practitioners.
But the much-publicised Pounds 42m crash of the Savings and Investment Bank
in 1982 deeply scarred the island. It forced upon its legislators the
realisation that there is much more to operating a finance sector than
rudimentary checks.
Since the Financial Supervision Commission was instituted in 1983 it has
doggedly pursued and addressed areas within the finance industry that left
the island open to abuse. The commission is on the side of the investor, but
has remained sensitive to legitimate needs of the industry and production of
legislation always involves lengthy consultation with members of the
industry.
Mr Jim Noakes, director of the Finance Supervision Commission, said: 'If we
can establish the broad area of common interest between regulator and
regulated in safeguarding the customer, it's easier to isolate the cowboys.'
The banking sector continues to grow with two new institutions licensed in
the past 12 months, bringing the total up to 60 including the building
societies. Last year the commission announced it was opening the doors for
managed banks, but sought only those with sound, internationally reputable
parents. So far three have been set up.
Private banking is on the increase and in line with other jurisdiction most
island-based banks have set up trust administration arms, using their
international branch networks to build the client base. Barclays, Lloyds,
Midland, NatWest, Bank of Scotland and others offer specialised trust
administration.
Insurance forms a large part of the Manx finance industry and big life
assurance companies, such as Eagle Star, Royal Life and Safe Assurance of
the Danish Trygg group, have centred their offshore businesses there.
The growth of captive insurance companies in the Isle of Man reflects the
solid base of expertise available in this field. Last year the island
secured 30 per cent of captives formed worldwide and to date 102 captives
have been formed. These include such leading companies as Jaguar, British
Gas and Midland Electricity Board.
Investor protection is high on the priorities with legislation for deposit
and investor protection schemes passed this year. The schemes mirror those
in the UK, with deposit protection of maximum 75 per cent of the first
Pounds 20,000 covered and investor protection of maximum Pounds 48,000.
Trust and company formation and administration constitute a large proportion
of the finance sector but many professionals see this area as the weak link
in the chain of respectability and would like to see more control.
The three classes of company available are resident, tax-exempt and
non-resident. Tax-exempt are managed from the island but carry on business
elsewhere and are limited to certain types of business. Non-resident are
managed and do business elsewhere and the degree of anonymity this allows
leaves their use open to abuse.
So far the authorities have refused to eliminate the non-resident company as
an entity, in spite of this having been achieved in the Channel Islands.
Licensing of trust and company administration is being discussed as an
option. Mr Mark Solly, a partner in the accountancy firm Moore Stephens and
a former director of the Financial Supervision Commission, feels this may
prove difficult. He says the key to cleaning up the act is to insist on
accountability within the company by ensuring all companies have at least
one Manx director.
'I believe there are too many difficulties to introduce a licensing system
to make people responsible for companies they formed, and over which they
subsequently have no control,' he said.
While banks and reputable firms forming and administering trusts and
companies carry out rigorous checks on potential clients, unfortunately
there are still some practitioners who do not. Consequently the Manx fraud
squad has more than a full-time job dealing with inquiries from law
enforcement agencies abroad. The majority of these involve a Manx
non-resident company.
But the authorities recognise this gap in the legislation and Mr Noakes says
it is now their No 1 priority. Serious consultation on the issue is under
way between the authorities and members of the industry.
