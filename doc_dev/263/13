regulations - Isle of Man

THE ISLE OF MAN has achieved a broad-based maturity over the past 10 years
and earned a place among the best-regulated international financial centres.
Its products are sold worldwide, it has the largest off-shore life assurance
industry and one of the largest captive insurance industries.
But the transition from the gung ho days of the 1970s and early 1980s to
today's exacting standards required the dogged persistence of regulators and
legislators. The emphasis now in the island is on fine-tuning the
legislation and mopping-up any remaining malpractices.
Before the institution of the financial supervision commission (FSC) in
1983, the island did little to dispel its image of a haven for tax evaders
and other assorted people of dubious practices. Though regulation existed,
it was not backed up by supervision and malpractice was rife. However, the
attitude of the legislators was dramatically changed in 1982 by the Pounds
42m crash of one of the island's banks, the Savings and Investment Bank.
The grief and furore surrounding this event prompted the Manx government to
set up the FSC, which has subsequently worked hard to introduce a regulatory
regime that makes the island safe for investors. But it is a constant
juggling act - on the one hand ensuring investors and depositors are
protected and on the other ensuring the regulations do not become so onerous
as to frighten away firms and institutions that make up the sector.
The island, in the middle of the Irish Sea, is a self-governing Crown
dependency of the UK. It is not a member of the EC but has some access to it
through the UK and shares in its customs and excise administration.
The financial services sector produces around one-third of the island's GNP,
a contribution expected to expand over the next 10 years to 50 per cent as
other industries decline. The sector's client base is largely individual
rather than corporation - high net worth individuals and expatriates based
all over the world. Services offered include banking, investment, insurance,
trust and company administration and a shipping register.
In spite of the recession, the island continues to experience growth, albeit
at a slower pace than two years ago. With corporate tax fixed at 20 per cent
and interest paid gross, it remains an attractive place to do business. But
the Manx government is not complacent and last year reduced tax payable by
fund managers on fee income from 20 per cent to 5 per cent to add to the
island's attractions.
Because of its size, population 70,000, the island offers easy and frequent
access to members of the industry, civil service and government. The
downside of this is that with so much business and social contact, the lines
defining conflict of interest in the long term become blurred in some
instances.
Though this does not happen to the majority of those in the finance industry
because most top executives have been brought in from outside the Isle of
Man. It is likely to be at least a decade before the island can produce
sufficient staff with the levels of education and experience to fill most of
the top posts.
But commercial courses are now more readily available at the island's
college of further education and jobs exist to draw back those who go to
England to graduate. Expansion of the island's professions is producing some
excellent young lawyers and accountants, most of whom are choosing to eschew
the previously de rigueur membership of freemasonry or other closely-knit
groups in the island and to retain their autonomy.
Mr William Cain, QC, the Manx attorney-general, said: 'There are no major
legislative changes in prospect for financial services. But in the current
legislative programme we are addressing time-share operation and company and
trust administration.' He added that in the longer term the island will
update its insolvency law and company law.
The Isle of Man is the first offshore jurisdiction to tackle the problems
created by abuse of facilities for trust and company administration. These
fiduciary services were initially instituted as aids to legitimate tax
planning and much of the business remains in that category. But over the
years, criminal elements have found them ideal instruments to aid their
illicit money-go-round.
Some practitioners appear to attract dubious clients with persistent
regularity. The proposed legislation hopes to deal with this type of client.
Preparation of the legislation is the remit of the FSC. Mr Jim Noakes, its
chief executive, said: 'The majority of people in the industry think some
action in this area is desirable but there is a lot of anxiety about what
the FSC may propose - anxiety about the unknown.'
Mr Peter Vanderpump, senior partner of Touche Ross in the Isle of Man, said
his firm has always supported the government's efforts to ensure the island
is well regulated. But he is less sure about this proposal and said: 'There
is a danger of over-regulation with the consequent risk of losing
good-quality business. In our view, the proposed regulation of company and
trust managers, in the form that we have seen it, falls into the category of
over-regulation.'
Mr Noakes said there will be full consultation with members of the industry
before the legislation is drafted next year.
