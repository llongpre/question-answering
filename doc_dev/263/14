FT  22 JUN 93 / Administrators to fight Pounds 8m Nadir share transfer deal

THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International are to appear in court early
next month to fight for cancellation of a transfer of Pounds 8m in shares
from a subsidiary in the group to Mr Asil Nadir.
Lawyers for the administrators will appear in the Isle of Man courts on July
6 to dispute the transfer of the shares held by Voyager, a Manx-registered
company, which took place four days before PPI entered administration in
October 1990.
They will argue that the transfer of shares in A N Graphics, a Turkish
printing company, was invalid because it took place at an illegally
constituted board meeting held without notifying all the directors.
The details emerged as the Isle of Man government prepared to acquire the
assets of another Manx company owned personally by Mr Asil Nadir. Hillgate
Limited, registered in the Isle of Man since 1973, is due to be struck off
the island's companies' register for not filing annual returns since 1990.
Under the island's company law, assets of companies struck off become the
property of the Manx treasury. Mr Nadir is listed as Hillgate's major
shareholder.
Hillgate's assets include a Jersey-registered company, Restro, used by Mr
Nadir for his dealings in Polly Peck group shares. Both are his personal
companies and not part of Polly Peck.
Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'We
considered getting involved (with Hillgate) but on a risk-reward basis it
did not seem the right way to proceed.'
The Manx company was set up originally as part of a legal capital gains tax
avoidance scheme. Such schemes were popular at the time particularly for
takeovers and flotations. By exchanging UK company shares for shares in an
offshore company in a 'paper-for-paper' transaction capital gains tax was
avoided when the shares were sold to the public.
Hillgate was first incorporated as Wearwell Holdings, then changed its name
in 1980. In December 1990 three Manx nominee directors resigned and since
then the company has been without directors and has filed no annual returns.
As well as Mr Nadir's holding of 800 B shares, there is a block of 97 A
shares held by a nominee company. It has not been possible to identify the
beneficial owner of these shares.
Meanwhile, Mr Christopher Morris, administrator to Polly Peck at Touche
Ross, said yesterday that he had been in touch with the Conservative party
concerning Mr Nadir's political donations. He said he will be seeking advice
on the issue from the company's creditors' committee.
