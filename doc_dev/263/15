A SCHEME to compensate depositors who lost savings in the Isle of Man branch
of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International fails to offer the same
rights against the collapsed bank as a similar scheme in mainland Britain,
former BCCI clients said yesterday.
More than 5,000 depositors in the Manx branch of BCCI, which closed with
approximately Pounds 90m on deposit, have been given a warning that a
repayment scheme drawn up by the island's Financial Supervision Commission
might mean less redress for them than for claimants using the UK depositor
protection scheme.
Although the Manx scheme offers the same maximum compensation level offered
on the mainland - Pounds 15,000 - it also asks depositors to transfer to the
scheme manager any rights or claims in respect of BCCI, the liquidation and
the government of Abu Dhabi contribution fund.
The estimated cost of compensation under the island's scheme will be Pounds
21m.
The BCCI Depositors' Protection Association said yesterday that under the UK
protection scheme depositors were asked to relinquish their rights only in
respect of the liquidation and not in respect of the proposed Abu Dhabi
scheme.
The association's legal advisers are investigating the difference between
the Manx and UK schemes, the association said.
Mr Brian Rogers, of Port St Mary, in the Isle of Man, spokesman for the
newly formed committee for depositors in the Isle of Man branch, said the
requirement that the Manx depositors should give up those rights exceeded
any similar requirement imposed on depositors under the UK or Abu Dhabi
schemes.
As the proposed Abu Dhabi scheme is for 10 per cent of amounts on deposit,
depositors of more than Pounds 150,000 might see more from there than from
the Manx scheme. They should therefore not be hasty in signing away their
rights to such a claim.
Mr Jim Noakes, director of the Isle of Man Financial Supervision Commission,
the island's scheme manager, said there was no guarantee that the Abu Dhabi
scheme would go ahead.
It requires a minimum 70 per cent of the depositors, by value of funds, to
waive their rights to claim against persons in Abu Dhabi.
Mr Noakes also said that the requirement in the Manx scheme to waive those
rights was part of the regulations that state, 'existing rights shall vest
in the scheme manager'. The scheme came into being in February last year and
is funded by contributions from island-based banks. A Supreme Court judge in
Kingston, Jamaica, has refused a plea by the Jamaican branch of BCCI to stay
the distribution of its assets until an appeal against a liquidation order
is heard. BCCI Jamaica is a branch of BCCI (Overseas), which is registered
in the Cayman Islands.
