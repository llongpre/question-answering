THE ISLE of Man government yesterday presented to Tynwald, the island's
parliament, a budget designed to spread the benefits from the island's
thriving economy among less well-off residents and increase aid for business
ahead of the island's autumn general election.
The Isle of Man, a crown dependency, has its own parliament and manages its
own financial arrangements, including setting its level of taxation.
The Manx government will give an initial allowance of 100 per cent on new
capital expenditure for industrial, tourist and agricultural buildings. Manx
government grants towards such expenditure will no longer be taken into
account when determining the allowance.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx treasury minister, said his intention was to
assist business, while 'seeking to ensure adequate funding for the provision
of enhanced public services and for assistance to the less well-off'.
Mr Gelling had Pounds 355m to distribute - Pounds 47m more than last year -
of which Pounds 49m is intended for capital expenditure. He decided against
a transfer from revenue to the reserve fund, which stands at Pounds 61.5m
and will benefit from Pounds 4.75m in interest earned and the sale of Manx
banknotes and coins.
The island retains its two-tier tax system, with personal income tax for
residents at 15 per cent for the first Pounds 8,000 of taxable income and 20
per cent on the balance. Non-residents and companies will continue to pay
income tax at 20 per cent on their whole taxable income.
Personal allowances will increase from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 5,650 for a
single person and from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 11,300 for a married couple,
fully transferable between husband and wife. Single parents' allowances rise
from Pounds 3,440 to Pounds 3,900 and a registered blind person's allowance
increases Pounds 200 to Pounds 1,450.
Prescription charges stay at Pounds 1 an item and tax relief will be
introduced on premiums on private medical insurance for those aged 60 and
over.
The increase in VAT in the UK Budget gave Mr Gelling an unexpected
additional Pounds 2.65m, which is to be distributed to the island's
residents through rebates on water and electricity charges. An average
household in the island can expect a rebate of Pounds 32 a year on water and
Pounds 34 on electricity.
