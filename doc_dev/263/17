companies in the Isle of Man

THE Isle of Man government will today announce the appointment of a senior
officer to establish a regulatory system to control those in the island who
form and administer companies and trusts.
Such a system is urged in a report produced about company law and trust for
the Manx government and published today. The structure of such institutions
is regulated in Manx law while their practitioners are not.
The highly confidential nature of trusts and some types of offshore company
enables unscrupulous operators to create them for people who use them for
illegal purposes. When such instances come to light it causes acute
embarrassment to the Manx government and regulatory authorities. The Manx
Financial Supervision Commission was set up in 1983 after the collapse of
Savings and Investment Bank, and has worked hard to construct a regulatory
system for the island's finance sector. Formations of companies and trusts
 -the backbone of any offshore financial services centre  - is the final gap
in Manx legislation.
Today's report was commissioned by the island's government after publication
in May last year of a report by Deemster John Corrin, the island's senior
judge.
He said then: 'I am very concerned about the integrity and competence of
those who earn their living by holding themselves out to form and administer
companies.'
Deemster Corrin recommended legislation:
To regulate and control those who form and administer Manx companies.
To make those who acquire and use Manx companies accountable to the island's
authorities.
To establish a supervision commission for companies.
The Manx government has accepted a recommendation in today's report that the
job of implementing those recommendations should be given to the financial
supervision commission.
Deemster Corrin also called for legislation:
To facilitate investigation of the affairs of companies  - consultation has
already begun about inserting a clause in the island's Companies Bill to
provide for inspections of companies.
To regulate those who carry on business as trustees  - consultation has
begun about a bill to regulate such people. To enable serious fraud cases to
reach the courts and be heard more quickly. Legislation to secure a more
speedy passage through the courts is expected this year.
The commission will be given enough resources to appoint an officer and
establish a system of regulation and supervision for all company and trust
business except insurance business, which is regulated by the Manx Insurance
Authority.
The commission is to submit proposals to enforce company law more
effectively and to consider legislation to make those acquiring and using
Manx companies more accountable to the island's authorities.
The authorities have already talked to financial professionals about the
best way to regulate this area. Points discussed include a code of practice,
a requirement for professional indemnity insurance, an obligation for
somebody in each company to be responsible to the supervisory commission and
controls on formation of companies in other areas by people based in the
Isle of Man.
Mr Jim Noakes, director of the supervisory commission, said he favoured a
register for practitioners rather than licensing. He felt that the concept
of 'fit and proper' should apply also to a company's directors, managers,
owners and controllers. Failing that, they should not be allowed to stay in
business in the Isle of Man.
Mr Noakes accepts that it may be hard to find the right person to be
regulating officer. 'We don't expect to do all this very easily, or without
cuts and bruises,' he said.
