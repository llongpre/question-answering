FT  05 JUN 92 / Manx taxation reform planned

THE ISLE of Man plans to reform the taxation of companies owned by
non-residents that conduct business outside the island, in an attempt to
attract international holding companies.
About 4,000 companies are registered on the island as exempt companies. They
are owned and carry on business outside the island; they pay an annual fee
of Pounds 250 and are not taxed on profits. No island resident may have a
shareholding in such a company, but each company must have a Manx-resident
director and company secretary.
New legislation will extend the range of exempt companies to include
Manx-registered public companies. The Isle of Man Treasury said that would
allow island residents to hold a limited number of shares, but emphasised:
'We will not allow any Manx resident to shelter income in these companies.'
The new category of international companies will pay a minimum tax charge
equivalent to the current annual fee. There will be flexibility to have a
specific rate of tax applied, up to 20 per cent, which the island's
authorities say may be more appropriate for an international corporation
with a fixed global tax policy.
