benefits - Investment

THE MANX investment industry, once regarded as a disreputable dwelling for
dubious dealers, received the stamp of royal approval last week.
Clerical Medical International, one of the most successful life assurance
groups to have started on the island in the last decade, won a Queen's Award
for Export Achievement.
Mr Miles Walker, the chief minister, was delighted by the news, but added:
'It not only reflects their business acumen but also endorses the status
which the Isle of Man has earned and continues to earn as a growing
worldwide financial services centre.' This assessment is not over-stated.
Life assurance has been a particular success for the island, as life company
subsidiaries have taken advantage of tax privileges introduced to encourage
captive insurance companies. Insurers which do no business on the island are
exempt from tax.
Last year, Hafnia Prolific International, a subsidiary of the Danish life
group, became the latest to establish itself in Douglas.
By the end of its first year HPI had Pounds 50m in funds under management, a
figure which has since grown to around Pounds 80m. It now employs more than
20 people and is set to move to a new office, although the merger of Hafnia
with Skandia, whose subsidiary Royal Skandia is also based on the island,
may put a long-term question mark over its future.
The island's space for expansion has also helped. For example, Royal Life
International, the largest and longest established Manx life insurer, has
moved its 170 employees into a spacious new building on the southern tip of
the island - a marked improvement on the five offices the company used
touse. Royal Skandia's new office, in a renovated church which forms one of
Douglas' most distinctive landmarks, would also make most City-dwellers
green with envy.
Marketing has been the key to the expansion of CMI, and of Royal Life
International. They no longer concentrate on the UK expatriate market, but
instead look for 'international investors'. CMI now has more than 60 outlets
around the world. The tax position of the island allows high net worth
individuals, even if resident in their own country, to benefit, and
marketeers are finally learning to exploit this.
Hong Kong accounts for 25 per cent fo CMI's business and 35 per cent of
RLI's, and both are exploiting new markets in South America, the Gulf, and
Africa.
Allied Dunbar, which manages Dollars 177m on the island for 7,000 clients,
is also revamping its sales practices, with the creation of a new post in
charge of international marketing.
New concessions for non-life linked funds could be vital for the life
groups. The government wants fund management to provide an appropriate
'third leg' to their financial services industry, joining banking and
insurance.
The tax incentives introduced last year to bring in fund managers amount
almost to personal bribes. From April 6 this year, managers of Isle of Man
collective investment schemes have paid a concessionary 5 per cent rate of
income tax. This incentive will last at least until 2005.
Earlier this month Pierson Heldring &amp; Pierson, a subsidiary of ABN Amro
Bank, set up a fund administration subsidiary on the island, and cited tax
concessions as the main reason for its decision - music to the government's
ears.
The island also offers an attractive regulatory framework for managers
wanting to start innovative funds. The options are as follows:
Authorised schemes are designed to be directly comparable to UK authorised
unit trusts. This puts broad limits on the types of securities which can be
held, but allows Manx trusts, with their tax advantages, to be marketed on
the same basis as UK unit trusts.
In December last year, the Japan Securities Dealers Association in Tokyo
announced that these schemes were eligible for sale to Japanese investors.
Mr Donald Gelling, treasury minister, called this 'a further boost to our
efforts to develop the Island as the major 'Offshore Europe' funds location
of the 1990s'.
Restricted schemes are described by Mr Christopher Edmonds, collective
investments supervisor, as 'second tier' funds for offer to sophisticated
private investors. Examples would include managed futures and options funds,
or derivatives funds which offer a 'guarantee'.
These cannot be marketed with the same freedom as a unit trust, but they
could provide many firms with attractive options for their private clients.
There are now 68 such schemes, and regulators are hoping for a swift
expansion.
Exempted restricted schemes are essentially private, and of appeal only to
professional investors such as pension funds. The maximum number of
participants is 50, and these schemes may not be offered to the general
public.
But the Manx authorities hope they will help to funnel more funds in the
island's direction - for example, Mr Edmonds suggests that pension funds
could spread risk by collaborating on offshore derivatives funds using this
vehicle.
Closed-end schemes, similar to UK-based investment trusts, are also allowed,
as are limited partnerships. Since they are not regarded as collective
investment schemes, but as companies, they are not subject to strict
regulation.
Judging by progress so far, it seems that the Isle of Man's third financial
leg is alive and kicking.
