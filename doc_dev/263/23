FT  13 AUG 92 / Isle of Man proposes corporate tax changes

THE ISLE of Man yesterday issued a consultative document proposing the
reform of its corporate taxation legislation.
Its main aims are to simplify legislation, improve government cashflow and
enhance the island's competitive edge as a business location.
The consultative document was prepared by a working party set up in May
chaired by Mr Keith Harrison, chairman of the Manx company Royal Life
International and deputy chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland (Isle of Man).
Mr Harrison said yesterday that the island's basic company taxation
legislation had changed little since its introduction in 1918. Amendments
over the years had resulted in a complex system that created distortions.
Corporate taxation, at a flat rate of 20 per cent, accounts for about 40 per
cent of Manx government income. About Pounds 34m is raised from annual
assessments on 13,000 companies.
The working party aims to simplify the basis of assessment for companies
setting up on the island.
At present, a new company is assessed in its first year on income from the
date of commencing business to the following April 5; in its second year on
the whole of that year's income; and in its third year on the whole of the
previous year's income. After that, the assessment is on the income shown in
the previous accounting year.
The consultative document recommends that assessments be linked to a
company's accounting period. Mr Harrison said that would remove the
advantage of tax planning and create 'a level playing field for everybody'.
He said companies should concentrate on growth in their early years, rather
than being concerned with tax planning.
Most Manx companies end their year on December 31, which means a large
concentration of work in December and January for the tax office and related
professionals.
If the taxation system reflected company year-ends connected to the
commencement of business, the workload, and government income, would be
spread throughout the year.
The working party also wants to avoid the double taxation that can apply to
company dividends raised in the first three years of trading.
Relief on a dividend is allowed only once, but the assessment system in the
early years means a dividend may be included in an assessment twice  - in
the second and third years. Companies get relief on the first inclusion but
not on the second.
The consultative document suggests the consideration of a small company tax
rate. Self-assessment is another option under review.
The government has invited comment from the island's business and
professional community, before an interim report next spring. Mr Harrison
said he expected a final report with legislative recommendations to be
published by the end of next year.
