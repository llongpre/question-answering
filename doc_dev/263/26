changing role of professionals

EXPANSION OF the island's financial services sector and its markets has
resulted in major changes in working practices for Manx-based professionals,
particularly accountants and lawyers.
In only a few years, the range of work has increased dramatically and now
includes a large proportion of international and complex matters.
For the island-based accountant or lawyer, this has meant choosing which
areas to cover and, in some cases, merging into larger practices that offer
various disciplines. It is no longer possible for a small practice to offer
all the services demanded by the island's increasingly international client
base.
One of the biggest changes for accountancy in the Isle of Man over the past
10 years has been the arrival and development of the practices of six major
international firms - KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst a Young, Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
Pannell Kerr Forster, Price Waterhouse and Touche Ross. All now have a
substantial presence.
Mr Peter Vanderpump, partner in charge of the Manx office of Touche Ross,
said the move had been away from the core base of auditing accountancy. 'The
larger firms offer a much wider range of services, including consultancy,
offshore companies and trusts, and international tax planning for both
individuals and companies and liquidations,' he said.
The firm is liquidator for the Manx branch off BCCI, and Mr Vanderpump said
this involved a core team of three to four people full time. He feels the
island has become better known by people outside, and that the firm has
gained more recognition in the Isle of Man.
Touche Ross set up its Manx office in 1987 with 11 people. 'Initially,' said
Mr Vanderpump, 'everyone did some of everything. We are now 40 people in the
office and have become a much more structured organisation, with each
department having grown staggeringly.'
If the island continued to sell itself as a leading offshore centre, he
added, the next five years would see more growth.
However, Manx-based individuals and small businesses still need their
audits, and some practitioners have opted to stick with this client base.
One such accountant is Mr David Craine, a partner in the two-partner firm
Browne Craine.
Local audits make up 80 per cent of his firm's work is. 'We are a small
local practice and want to remain so,' he said.
But he has seen changes in his work over the years, and has found that there
is much more compliance work to be done for local clients than a few years
ago. 'Laws and regulations are changing all the time, and we have to keep up
to date.'
His clients have also had to change in attitude: 'Some of them we've had to
drag into the 20th century.'
Mr Craine's decision to service local auditing needs has not precluded the
firm's involvement in business outside the Isle of Man. It is a member of
Inpact, an association of small accountancy firms in 22 European countries.
Inpact members provide assistance and referrals to each other.
The island's five lawyers face the same change in demands, and many smaller
advocates' firms have merged. But Mr Alan Cough, of Cough &amp; Co, chose to
stay in sole practice and develop a specialisation in international
litigation.
He began sole practice in the island in 1976, when he dealt with everything,
from wills to boundary disputes. His first big international High Court
case, which lasted over two years, was in 1979.
From around 1986, island advocates have had a steady flow of international
work. 'Since then the size, number and complexity of cases has doubled every
year. I used to handle around 200 cases a year - now I personally deal with
five or six, which can take years to conclude,' he said. He has been
involved in internationally known cases such as Barlow Clowes, Polly Peck
and Rossminster. Mr Cough feels that his specialist approach has made his
practice one of the busiest in the island.
He has recently taken partners into the firm to assist with similar work,
trusts, receiverships and fund business. Future expansion may involve taking
on more advocates and solicitors.
Much of his firm's work is sorting out, through the courts, Manx trusts that
were badly formed some years ago, and encompasses a fully international
client base. He does not expect this work to decline for some years.
Mr John Crellin is senior partner in Cains, one of the island's largest and
oldest law firms. 'When I became senior partner 20 years ago, there were
four partners and 20 staff. Now we have eight partners, seven solicitors and
barristers and 70 staff,' he said.
The firm began finance sector business in the mid-1960s. 'Those were the
buccaneering days, when there was little regulation in the Isle of Man,' Mr
Crellin recalls. Now, demands are far more stringent and the firm has within
defined areas of specialisation within it. This includes three partners and
one advocate who practice law purely for the finance sector.
Mr Crellin feels that the proportion of local business has dropped, but by
specialisation Cains is able to serve both the finance sector and its
traditional clients.
He said the Manx bar was small in the 1950s, but its expansion had resulted
in a more credible bar which is more balanced in knowledge. Yet he believes
that all the island's lawyers are going to have to specialise and
individually to recognise their limitations in order to meet modern demands.
