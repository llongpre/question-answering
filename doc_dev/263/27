FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (1): A thriving outpost few want
to leave

The island enjoys political stability; fund management is growing fast,
fuelled by generous tax breaks; banking and insurance already have a sure
hold.  Yet some people resent the growing power of the EC, while others fear
that a mainland government committed to cutting income tax may reduce the
island's attractiveness to UK citizens. Tourism is seen as a possible area
for expansion, though it might create only temporary jobs
TIMES MAY be hard in the rest of the British isles, but in the Isle of Man,
the Celtic outpost of the Irish Sea, business is booming.
One of the prime reasons will be familiar to anybody who watched the UK
election campaign - personal taxation.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx finance minister, presented his budget earlier
this month, and the tax rates he announced would certainly have been enough
to win the UK election.
The basic rate of income tax is 15 per cent, with a top rate of 20 per cent.
Tax relief at the top rate is available on all loans from Manx lenders -
that includes credit cards as well as mortgages - and personal allowances
before tax is payable stand at Pounds 6,000 for those who are single, and
Pounds 12,000 for married couples. A family unit can earn Pounds 28,000
before incurring tax at the top rate of 20 per cent.
No wonder so many businessmen who go to the island never want to leave.
The UK election may have removed the possibility of higher tax rates, which
would automatically have increased the attractions of investing offshore;
but Labour had been keen to attack the island's tax privileges, so the Manx
business community was not distraught.
Financial services continue to grow, and unemployment, while it has risen
slightly to around 1,200, is still at a level which any UK politician would
describe as 'full employment'.
Leaps forward in the regulation of the financial services sector, since the
establishment of the Financial Supervision Commission in 1983, have
triggered a fast expansion in the island's financial services industry. It
was the first offshore jurisdiction to win designated status under the UK's
Financial Services Act of 1988, which effectively recognised that the Manx
offered the same degree of investor protection as the British.
Fund management is growing fast on the island, fuelled by generous tax
breaks announced last year, and operative since the beginning of this month.
Banking and insurance already have a sure hold.
Political stability is profound, as the Tynwald, the Manx parliament, sails
serenely into its second millennium. It is the longest continuous parliament
in the world. Overcrowding is not a problem, and shows no signs of becoming
one - the island's 70,000 population is roughly equal to that of Jersey, but
spread over an area six times as large. It is also well educated, providing
a valuable pool of labour.
But not everything in the garden is lovely. The budget also announced a
slight deficit this year, and Mr Gelling provided a Pounds 4m 'kick start'
for the industrial sector. And there are broader causes for concern.
Ugly sentiments have been stirred up by a confrontation with the European
Community. The Tynwald has never got round to legalising homosexuality, to
which many of the islanders, who tend to have a very traditionalist moral
outlook, object strongly. But the island is a party to the convention of the
European Court of Human Rights, which upholds gay rights.
Many who had no quarrel with gay rights objected to new laws being forced on
the island by the European Court.
Attempts by the political leadership to pass legislation allowing
homosexuality between consenting adults therefore led to passionate rows in
the Tynwald, physical threats against those who led the drive for reform,
and some deeply reactionary letters to local newspapers.
Following a majority of two in the House of Keys, the Tynwald's equivalent
of the Commons, reform now seems certain to reach the statute book without a
constitutional showdown. But islanders have been greatly embarrassed by some
of the coverage of the incident which appeared in UK tabloids.
There is also cause for concern on the commercial front.
Mr Colin Coates, a partner with Touche Ross, made some heretical comments in
a presentation to the island's business community immediately after the
budget. The reaction to his arguments was divided, but he seemed to prove
that the island cannot yet afford to rest on its laurels. In particular, the
growing power of Europe could pose a threat.
This is what Mr Coates had to say: 'Close to home, we have a Tory Government
committed to reducing income tax, to limiting the impact of inheritance tax,
and to allow the creators of wealth to retain a greater portion of that
wealth. This must reduce the fiscal attractiveness of the island to UK-based
individuals.
'The extent to which the European Community is a market for our financial
and professional services is debatable. Offshore centres within the EC, and
more are entering the fray, have considerable marketing advantages, as
evidenced by UK groups establishing in Luxembourg rather than the Isle of
Man and Channel Islands. It does not appear that EC tax harmonisation is
going to affect these centres for the foreseeable future.'
Mr Michael Gates, corporate development officer for the island, rejects this
argument more or less in its entirety. He points out that the current
advantages flowing to Luxembourg and Dublin within the EC cannot last
forever, while Manx legislation has ensured that the island's funds need not
miss out on the opportunities for cross-border marketing of mutual funds.
Meanwhile, the UK's current massive borrowing requirement should be enough
to ensure that a hefty tax differential is maintained, according to Mr
Gates.
Should the UK opt to raise VAT, the differentials could be widened. The
island has to levy VAT at the same rate as the mainland, so this would
provide an increase in the government's income, allowing further cuts in
personal taxes.
So Mr Coates' final suggestion is for renewed investment in an unfashionable
area - tourism. He said: 'If Tory policy succeeds, a growing number of
people in the UK will enjoy higher levels of disposable income. The island
is on their doorstep. It is a beautiful island with incredible potential to
market its historical sites and its recreational facilities. Every weekend
the island should be crawling with tourists taking two- or three-day breaks.
When it gets to the point when we start to complain about the tourists, that
is when the industry will be a success.'
There is some force in this argument, and Mr Miles Walker, the chief
minister, is keen to expand the island's tourist industry. Take away the
financial services sector, and the island looks more like Cornwall than
Jersey or Guernsey.
Wild, starkly beautiful Celtic countryside leads to dramatic cliffs and long
beaches. The island's bizarre climate means that palm trees grow in relative
profusion.
The population has been deprived of its old mining industry - just like the
Cornish - while its fisheries and agriculture have contracted. Meanwhile, it
clings to a Celtic heritage, including the remnants of a native language.
Some businessmen enthused to Mr Coates' ideas, saying the Isle of Man should
be known as 'activity island'.
But the suspicion remains that jobs in tourism would be temporary. The
terrace of Edwardian guesthouses in Douglas, which currently services the
influx of visitors for the annual TT motor-cycle races, would have
difficulty accommodating a large tourist trade, and heavy investment in
infrastructure would be necessary first.
Mr Gates is keener to look for other areas of development. He points to the
'ball park' figures of the island's success - employment in the financial
sector has trebled in 10 years, despite computers, bank deposits on the
island total Pounds 9.5bn, and the number of captive insurers has increased
from three to 117 since 1981.
His interests now are to encourage more fund managers to come to the island,
and to persuade executives to use it as a base for international holding
companies. A review of company taxation was announced in the budget, while
the maximum registration fee for a company wishing to capitalise itself on
the island was slashed from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 5,000.
The Manx are adamant that Europe is not a threat - indeed, they are hunting
new business in the Far East and in North America. Their role model now is
not Jersey, Guernsey, or even Luxembourg. It is Bermuda.
According to Mr Gelling, the Isle of Man could play the same role for Europe
which Bermuda does for the US: 'The island expects that it will become one
of the key 'gateways' for funds flowing into the EC's major financial
centres from the Far East, North America and elsewhere.'
The problems raised by Touche Ross remain to be confronted, but the island
cannot be faulted in the determination of its attempt to establish itself in
this key world role.
