ISLE of Man treasury officials failed to monitor the Savings and Investment
Bank (SIB) and allowed it to trade while insolvent for at least 16 months
before it crashed 10 years ago, according to the Chadwick report published
yesterday.
They then refused to co-operate with Mr John Chadwick QC, who had been
ordered by the Manx High Court to investigate why the bank collapsed owing
Pounds 42m to 3,000 depositors, most of them local savers. His report
appeared after six years of legal delays.
In 1989 SIB depositors went to the Privy Council - the ultimate court of
appeal for the Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency. Their claim
of negligence could not proceed because the council ruled that the
government had no legal duty of care towards depositors. Mrs Frances Harper,
a Douglas resident who lost Pounds 20,000, said yesterday: 'This absolutely
stinks.
'If we had been able to have this report when we sued the Manx government,
we might not have lost our case at the Privy Council. Justice delayed has
been justice denied,' she said. It was only after a new Manx government was
elected in 1986 that fraud squad investigations began into the bank crash,
but charges against eight owners, managers or agents were dismissed in 1990
because of the delay in bringing them.
Only Pounds 8m of the bank's Pounds 44m of loans has been recovered.
Depositors have had a return of 27 1/2 p in the pound from the liquidators
but are seeking compensation from the Manx government.
Mr Miles Walker, the Isle of Man's chief minister, is planning ex gratia
payments to depositors of up to Pounds 5,000, but Mrs Harper described the
amount as a 'pittance'.
