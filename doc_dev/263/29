THE MANX government yesterday ruled out proposals to amend its protection
scheme for depositors in the Isle of Man branch of BCCI.
The Manx scheme offers the same levels of compensation as the UK scheme but
requires claimants to waive all rights they may have under a proposed Abu
Dhabi settlement.
Compansation claims for the Isle of Man scheme must be submitted by July 15.
The Manx scheme was introduced five months before BCCI's collapse. It is
funded by contributions from island's banks and building societies. The BCCI
collapse is thought to have cost the scheme pounds 21m.
