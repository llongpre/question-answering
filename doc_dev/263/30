A SMALL company registered in the Isle of Man is at the centre of attempts
by arms merchants to use the Baltic republics as conduits for illegal
shipments of weapons from the former Soviet Union.
Two consignments containing 40,000 Russian-made small arms with a potential
market value of Dollars 4m were stopped recently in Estonia and Finland.
Both of them, described by arms industry experts as 'large orders almost
certainly bound for re-export', were addressed to Kennford Enterprises, an
Isle of Man-registered non-resident company.
The seizures have fuelled concerns that the break-up of the Soviet Union,
with the lack of border controls being exploited both by hard-pressed arms
producers and by soldiers selling their weapons, could lead to a flood of
illegal arms finding their way to terrorist groups around the world,
including the IRA. Customs officials said the guns seized in the Estonian
capital, Tallinn, were 'probably not the first and not the last'.
Estonia appealed to a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels last
month for equipment and assistance to control its borders.
Containers loaded with 14,982 Makarov automatic pistols were discovered on
February 11 by Estonian customs in the port area of Tallinn. Shipment papers
described the contents as 7,200 'sports and training pistols', bound for
Kennford Enterprises in Finland. Estonia's state prosecutor is investigating
the case.
The guns came from a factory at Izhevsk, about 500 miles east of Moscow,
which makes hunting guns and military pistols. The city is the centre of
Russia's small-arms industry and a separate factory there makes the renowned
Kalashnikov AK-47 rifle.
Within days a second shipment of 25,000 similar pistols were seized by
Finnish customs officers in Helsinki. The automatic pistols are standard
issue for the armies of the former Warsaw Pact.
Kennford Enterprises was incorporated in the Isle of Man in April, 1991. Its
two shareholders and directors are listed as Artur Pukhov, of Tallinn, and
his wife Lubov Pukhov, of Helsinki. The Financial Times has established,
however, that these are merely forwarding addresses - the inhabitant of the
Helsinki address expressed surprise that it was being used for this purpose
by Kennford. The Pukhovs, both Russians, operate from Yaroslavl, north-east
of Moscow.
The company was set up by International Company Services, a Manx company
formation business. Mr Philip Robinson of International Company Services
said the request to form Kennford had come from a third party and not from
the Pukhovs. He declined to identify the third party, but said his company
received a lot of business from this source.
Speaking from Yaroslavl, Mr Pukhov told the FT that the order he had handled
was for sports guns but that the identity of the buyer was a 'commercial
secret'. He said that the fact that the sports guns had been replaced by
Makarovs was 'not my responsibility.'
'I have never seen the merchandise and never checked it,' Mr Pukhov said
through an interpreter.
He said Kennford Enterprises mainly sold oil and rare metals, including
scandium which is bought by the pharmaceutical industry.
Draft proposals for regulating the large number of non-resident companies in
the Isle of Man are expected to go before the island's parliament next
month.
A separate seizure of arms and anti-tank weapons apparently destined for
Armenian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed Armenian enclave in
Azerbaijan, highlighted the problem of Soviet troops based in the Baltic
republics selling their weapons.
Under UK law, British companies can obtain Department of Trade licences to
import and export small arms of the kind seized in Estonia and Finland. The
countries with which trade in these weapons is banned are South Africa,
Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Argentina.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry said that the exports of arms
from the former Soviet republics was a 'matter for those countries not us'.
The UK Defence Ministry confirmed that it had been approached by the
Estonians on the small arms issue and said that it was anxious to ensure
that future trade in them was properly controlled.
