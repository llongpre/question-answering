THE ISLAND's agricultural sector is being hit hard by the single European
market. Many technical changes are demanded of an industry which consists
largely of small farms run by some of the last bastions of Manx tradition.
The island is not part of the EC, but is linked to it through being a Crown
dependency of the UK. It makes no financial contribution to Europe and
receives no financial aid from it. But the special relationship allows the
island to market agricultural products in the EC.
At least half of the island's produce is exported to the UK; the rest
supplies the home market. In order to retain its ability to export, the
island must comply with EC regulations on production and processing of food.
There are 800 producers in the Isle of Man - 80 per cent with holdings of
less than 200 acres. Only 77 have more than 300 acres out of the total
117,000 acres farmed. Together with processing, the industry provides
employment for about 1,500 people.
Many farms are passed from father to son and have remained traditional mixed
farms - sheep, cattle, dairy cows, grain and roots for fodder, potatoes and
poultry. Fields are small, some only four acres, and bound by ancient dry
stone walls.
Farming methods on the smaller units are traditional. Crop rotation has
always been practised: dung from the cattle is spread on the land, and the
abundance of wildlife in the hedgerows reflects the minimal use of
chemicals.
In 1934, Manx farmers set up marketing associations. These consist of
representatives from the farming community and professional administrators.
There is only one slaughterhouse licenced. This is owned by the Manx
government and rented and operated by the Fatstock Marketing Association.
There is also a government-owned creamery, rented and operated by the Milk
Marketing Association.
Initially, farmers were pleased to get out of the open market in the island,
where prices were being depressed by rings of buyers. But with production
costs increasing - not least because of freight costs on all goods imported
that are needed in agriculture - they feel restricted by the limitations of
the marketing associations' abilities to market.
In the UK, producers can specialise and find a market for their products.
The strip of water between the Isle of Man and the UK makes it far more
difficult for a Manx producer to gain access to these markets at
economically viable prices.
The smaller farmer is locked into the system. Both his income and
expenditure are decreed by others. The downturn over the past 15 years has
not left him with the financial resources to institute any major changes in
his stock or methods. His best hope is to improve the quality of his produce
to gain the maximum return available in his limited market.
Those who have kept abreast of technical changes are not finding EC
compliance such a burden. By continually updating equipment and systems,
they have assured themselves a reasonable income and future.
But these farmers are in the minority, and most find compliance an
additional chore, on which they see no immediate return. Mr John Corrin, the
Manx agricultural minister, said: 'There has not been intensive farming in
the island, and stock levels have not increased much over the years. The
Manx farmer does not feel he has contributed to European overproduction, and
he feels he has a right to continue his traditional farming system.'
The Manx government resolved to support the island's farmers to a similar
level as their EC counterparts are supported. 'Though this does not
necessarily mean the same support schemes as in the EC, in totality the
result will be the same,' said Mr Corrin. 'However, we must be mindful not
to
give our farmers an advantage over those in the EC. 'Though we have
limitations in continuity of supply, because of small production levels, if
our produce is high quality in a limited range there is a market for it.'
The government is negotiating to assist the marketing associations, which
are criticised by the farmers for poor results. 'It is in government's
interests that the associations work effectively, so that farmers do not
look to government to make up their shortfall,' said Mr. Corrin.
Investment of Pounds 5m is also planned by the Manx government for a new
meat plant. The island's existing abattoir and processing plant cannot be
altered to comply permanently with EC requirements.
The proposed plant, which will be one of the smallest EC-complying plants in
Britain, will be operational by 1994. With abattoirs closing throughout
Britain, this is regarded as a vote of confidence by the Manx government in
its agricultural industry. But the government also knows that collapse of
the industry would create a large unemployment problem in the island. It
could also leave thousands of acres of untended land.
