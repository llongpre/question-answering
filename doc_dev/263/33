FT  23 SEP 92 / Amateur politicians mauled by offshore sharks: An island
that cannot isolate its finances from the mainland

<DATELINE>
   THERE used to be two types of people on the Isle of Man
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the native Manx and the 'come-overs'. The latter were immigrants, sometimes
rich and mainly from England. If they did not like the island's way of life
and customs, the Manx retort was simple: 'If you don't like it, there's a
boat leaving every morning.'
As one well-heeled English come-over put it last week: 'I realised early on
this was a foreign country. Whingeing come-overs, or those who try to change
things, do not do well here.
'I decided to go with the grain and find a Manx partner to work with for my
business deals. It has worked well.'
He did not want to be named, fearful of falling foul of the network of
native islanders openly referred to as the 'Manx mafia'.
Two things are precipitating change, he said - a flood of technocratic
come-overs who have taken over the island's finance sector; and the collapse
10 years ago of the Savings and Investment Bank with Pounds 42m of
depositors' funds.
The Manx bank crash shook the island to its millennial roots and Tynwald,
the Manx parliament founded by the Vikings, put in tough supervision for the
finance sector. That achieved what Tynwald had wanted all along: serious
investment by respectable banks and insurance companies that knew they were
not going to be tainted by a milieu that encouraged crooks.
Last year's census shows that for the first time the proportion of the
population who are come-overs is now just over 50 per cent. That will not
last, because most of the come-overs are professionals whose children, born
on the island, are a new generation of native Manx people. Moreover, a
further type of islander has appeared - the 'come-backs'. These are native
Manx who emigrated, succeeded, and have returned to play an active part in
island life. They rarely returned in the past.
Mr David Cannan worked in Sri Lanka and Malaysia before settling in England,
where he owned several retail properties and became a Conservative county
councillor in Berkshire.
He joined the come-backs in 1980 and was elected to Tynwald after the Manx
bank crash. As finance minister in 1987 he called in the Metropolitan Police
fraud squad to investigate the Manx bank and, together with Mr Miles Walker,
then the new chief minister, insisted that the truth be disclosed.
The two eventually fell out politically - Mr Cannan is a Tory while Mr
Walker is much nearer to being a social democrat - but the truth about the
Manx bank finally came out yesterday with publication of the Chadwick
report, delayed because a fraud trial connected with the Manx bank's deals
in Britain was not completed until last month.
Even at 10 years' distance, the report is unpalatable.
In 1975 Tynwald decided to expand the island's finance sector to counter
chronic depopulation and decline in its traditional industries of tourism,
farming and fishing.
However, in a community the size of a small English market town, politicians
were part-time amateurs and soon found themselves in a sea of complicated
offshore tax law alive with sharks. They failed to see the danger and had no
budget for serious supervision - and there was no one capable of carrying
out that supervision.
The island became an easy place for speculators. Some obtained banking
licences and dipped directly into depositors' funds - some of it 'black'
money carried to the island in cash by tax evaders in Britain and Ireland -
to speculate, mainly in land and property in the UK.
Savings and Investment Bank was not a 'bad apple' - four other 'banks' also
crashed on the island in the early 1980s. But Savings and Investment Bank
had a disproportionate impact, because about 2,000 of its 3,000 depositors
were honest, innocent local savers.
Regulatory failings meant there was no political will to allow the truth to
emerge until the government changed in 1987. That proved fatal to punishing
the bank's principals - charges against them were dismissed in 1990 because
the delay in bringing them to trial was judged unreasonable.
Most believe such a thing could not happen again under the strict regime run
by Mr Jim Noakes, chief executive of the Financial Supervision Commission.
For example, anyone trying to deposit more than Pounds 1,000 in cash
anywhere on the island has to prove where it came from.
Mr Noakes believes offshore finance centres are a necessary adjunct of
international marketplaces such as London, Tokyo or New York, but that they
must be properly policed.
He says: 'What drives offshore centres is the ability to exploit differences
in international tax laws. You can do this openly and many respectable
financial and insurance companies do so.
'But where you get people doing it in secret, where you get an atmosphere
where you are not likely to encounter much punctiliousness by the
authorities, people with dubious records will try to take advantage of it.'
His toughness has en-couraged the respectable.
Royal Insurance, Roywest and Coutts are among the big operators that have
moved in or expanded. Clerical Medical Insurance has won a Queens Award for
Export from its Isle of Man base, while Barclays Bank has set up
international and money transmission operations on the island and grown from
under 100 staff to 260 in four years. The finance sector accounts for 30 per
cent of the economy and 14 per cent of jobs, with just as many in
professional services such as accountancy and the law.
Mr Noakes says the influx has brought professional competence and high
ethical standards, while there has been a shift in the nature of deals from
the personal to the institutional.
But until the Isle of Man confesses its sins over Savings and Investment
Bank and purges them by paying fair compensation to depositors, Mr Cannan
for one thinks its image will always be tainted.
