Yesterday saw the start of the annual Isle of Man TT races. The event
attracts about 30,000 fans, at least 10,000 of whom travel with their bikes,
Sue Stuart writes.
Residents welcome the races as a boost to the economy, but in recent years
the influx to an island with a population of only 70,000 has also brought
difficulties.
Mr Alan Bell, Manx tourism minister, said: 'Our biggest trouble is
logistical - getting to the island and then accommodating the numbers of
fans.' Over the past five years, the number of registered tourist beds has
halved because of declining tourism outside the TT period. The tourist board
has appealed for residents to accommodate race fans. The Isle of Man Steam
Packet, the island's only ferry service, has also cut services over the past
few years.
