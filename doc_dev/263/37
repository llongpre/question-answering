MR JAMES Sherwood, president of Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based cargo
equipment and ferry company, paid a surprise visit to the Isle of Man
yesterday to attend the 162nd annual meeting of the Isle of Man Steam Packet
Company.
Sea Containers holds a 41 per cent stake in the company after making a
hostile bid in 1990. The bid was later withdrawn, but, under Stock Exchange
rules, Mr Sherwood is now free to bid again.
Speculation was rife among Steam Packet shareholders that his presence at
yesterday's meeting heralded an announcement of such a move. However, Mr
Sherwood said Sea Containers had not decided at the moment to renew the bid.
Steam Packet achieved record results for 1991 with a 21 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4.1m.
Mr Norman Corlett, Steam Packet chairman, told the meeting: 'Once again I
have to express regret that so much time and money has been spent on
ownership matters. The Manx directors fervently hope that the future of the
Sea Containers shareholding will be resolved this year.'
Mr Corlett reported that for the first quarter of this year, passenger and
car carrying were up 2 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.
