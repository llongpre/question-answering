FT  10 OCT 92 / Suspended jail term for Manx bank chief

MR ROBERT KILLIN, 61, man-aging director of the collapsed Isle of Man
Savings and Investment Bank, received a 12-month suspended jail sentence
yesterday for conspiracy to defraud.
Judge Robert Hardy said his decision to suspend sentence in the case - which
resulted from a Pounds 550,000 fraudulent land deal - was because of the
length of the investigation and the trial at Manchester Crown Court.
The bank collapsed 10 years ago with Pounds 42m of depositors funds after a
series of risky, unsecured loans. Slack supervision by Manx authorities
allowed it to trade for 18 months while insolvent. Investigations on the
Isle of Man and in Britain took more than six years. Manx court cases
against the bank's principals collapsed in 1990 because of delays in
bringing charges.
Mr Robert Cunningham, general manager of the bank, was given a 12-month
suspended sentence last month. Sentencing of Mr Killin had been deferred.
Both had denied conspiracy to defraud in a four-month trial.
The fraud involved land at Baxenden, Lancashire, which was bought for Pounds
80,000 and sold the same day for Pounds 635,000 to Pennine Commercial
Holdings. The bankers were given shares afterwards and Mr Killin sold his
for more than Pounds 20,000.
The land had an inflated value because of a false valuation by a surveyor.
The Savings and Investment Bank provided the Pounds 80,000.
Mr David Knott, Pennine's managing director, also benefited from the illicit
profit of Pounds 550,000 on the Baxenden deal. He admitted conspiracy in
August 1989 and was jailed for six months with the balance of a two-year
term suspended.
