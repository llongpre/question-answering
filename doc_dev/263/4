IN THE 1960s and early 1970s, it was not unusual to see very elderly people
being wheeled in chairs or on stretchers down the Steam Packet gangway and
on to Manx soil. Their private rooms were already booked in the local
hospital, and they had come to the Isle of Man to die.
But they arrived with just enough breath in them to be rushed around by
teams of lawyers, accountants and undertakers, standing by to settle their
affairs the moment they got ashore.
These were the inheritance-tax exiles, who needed to prove that the Isle of
Man was their domicile of choice before they expired.
Prior to changes in the law in the mid-1970s, this could all be done at the
last moment. But the law changed, and now requires a minimum of three years'
residence prior to death for the revenue to allow a place to become a
person's domicile of choice. So moving to the Isle of Man to die has become
a far more civilised affair.
Since the Isle of Man has no capital gains tax or inheritance tax, people
move there to avoid these liabilities in the UK.
Mr Mark Solly, partner in the Manx office of accountancy firm Moore
Stephens, said people considering such a move should, 'get the best
available advice and not be afraid to pay for it. . . Having got that, they
must still be prepared to make their own decision - it is a very personal
decision.'
Such a move may mean giving up too much of their personal life, family,
friends, interests - or spending much of the tax they would save in
travelling to and from the island to continue pursuing these interests.
Mr Solly points out that those moving for capital gains tax reasons will
need to stay in the island for two to three years. The prime time to move is
just before April 5, to gain the whole of the following year as a non-UK
resident for tax purpose. This is likely to mean beginning house-hunting in
the island the previous autumn, and putting the UK home on the market. To
persuade the Inland Revenue that it is a genuine move, many doors must be
closed in the UK, such as resigning from clubs and trusteeships. The Revenue
must be satisfied that the centre of a person's life is in the Isle of Man.
For many men who make this move, island life can be quite full. 'These men
tend to be innovative, so they will get involved locally,' said Mr Solly.
But for some of their wives it is dismal. Though the island has a little of
everything, they miss the choice of good hotels, restaurants, shops, art and
concerts.
However, others get so involved in the life of the Isle of Man, with its
quiet, safety, beauty and temperate climate, that they stay on and make
permanent homes there.
Expansion of the business sector has led to an influx of executives who have
been transferred from another branch or changed companies to take up their
Manx-based position. Most find the island a delightful place to live, and
some refuse to be transferred back again at the end of theirs assigned term.
For those with children, the education system is good and the social
environment safe. A building boom over the past few years has produced a
good choice of houses, and many from the UK find property cheaper in the
island.
Such people are also free to travel to the UK as often as they wish, and so
do not suffer the feelings of deprivation experienced by some tax exiles.
With maximum income tax at 20 per cent, the island also attracts residents
who are high earners, such as racing driver Nigel ManseIl or
multi-millionaire Albert Gubay. A number of authors, particularly Mills and
Boon writers, choose the island for its low tax regime. But they live
quietly and shun publicity.
People in this category have chosen the Isle of Man from a range of low-tax
jurisdictions, so usually have few problems settling in. They also have
enough money to do the things they want, both in and out of the island.
The 1991 census showed a population increase of 5,000 over the previous 10
years, to 71,000, most of whom had come to work.
The island's new residents 'assist the economy in terms of their demand for
services,' said Mr John Cashin, the Manx treasurer. 'But this is not only
measured in cash terms. Were it not for this growth, the Manx population
would not enjoy the level of health and education services it currently
does.'
But capital expenditure has been needed by the Manx government, to enlarge
and update its infrastructure.
Mr Cashin explained that this include a large all-island sewage-disposal
system, extension to the hospital and health service properties, housing,
new schools, development at the harbour and airport, a new meat plant, and
the construction of a new electricity generating station.
