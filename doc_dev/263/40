FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (8): Islands in the sun - and ice /
Offshore centres
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax havens, offshore centres, areas of low tax. Whatever the label, the
times are getting tougher for the growing number of jurisdictions trying to
lure corporations and high wealth individuals around the world.
As small island economies around the world struggle to generate business and
diversify from tourism or primary industry, they have sought the help of
consultants to promote their attractions.
The big accountancy firms have been well in evidence: Price Waterhouse
advising Gibraltar, KPMG Peat Marwick helping Malta and Trinidad &amp; Tobago,
for example.
An unseemly struggle has developed between many centres, with glossy
marketing brochures and international conferences on the rise. The Isle of
Man is competing against the Channel Islands, and even the more sedate
Jersey and Guernsey are at each other's throats, hiring public relations
firms and holding presentations in London, Paris and other leading cities to
gather potential business.
Mr Patrick Way, an expert on offshore centres who is soon to be admitted to
the tax bar, says: 'I do think it's fair to say that in the last 15 years
there has been a shift with offshore centres becoming much more like
companies trying to go out and get business. People travel much more easily
now and are picking and choosing where to go.'
Meanwhile, there has been an explosion in the number of centres and enormous
flux in the range of tactics the centres have used in efforts to attract new
business: introducing new products, amending tax legislation, diluting
corporate disclosure and registration requirements.
'You can count the number of havens in three digits now,' says Mr Ian McDade
of Price Waterhouse. 'It's become a pretty crowded market and very
competitive.'
Caroline Doggart, author of a regular survey of tax havens,* says that
Campione, on the border of Switzerland and Italy, was the first tax haven
when both nations abdicated their fiscal responsibility for the region.
One of the most recent, designed to exploit existing tax treaties, is Labuan
off Malaysia, while a reef, between Tonga and Fiji, has been mooted as the
world's first underwater retreat]
In between come a vast array of locations, generally in relatively tropical
climes: Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin
Islands, the Cook Islands, and so on.
There are also the colder environs: the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man,
the Falklands, Norway's Svalbard Islands and Ascension. Others are
landlocked: such as Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, or even Albania. However,
Doggart also highlights less likely low tax areas, not least the UK, which
remains a very attractive low-tax centre for non-residents, and the US
compared with many European countries.
Mr Roger White of KPMG Peat Marwick, says he draws 'a sharp distinction'
between the less reputable centres and those such as the Channel Islands or
Hong Kong with economies in their own right and a developed, sophisticated,
responsible approach. He believes this two tier split will accentuate in the
future.
The problem is that the islands have become increasingly aggressive at a
time when the demand is slowing down as a result of recession in many parts
of the world. Mr John Fairley, partner in charge of the international tax
group at Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'Clearly there is a greater need at the moment
to get your cash back home.'
Equally, he highlights a tightening up in the global network of tax
treaties, increased cooperation by fiscal authorities around the world, and
the growing use of controlled foreign corporation legislation to clamp down
on companies using tax havens.
In 1981, a report by Richard Gordon, special counsel to the US Internal
Revenue Service, led to calls in the US legislature for a ban on flights to
some of the more questionable offshore jurisdictions.
In practice, the action taken by the US may have been less visible but it
has proved at least as powerful, with the Internal Revenue Service taking an
increasingly aggressive line on revising or simply tearing up existing tax
treaties.
One of the most significant such examples is the US-Dutch double taxation
treaty. Initially drafted in 1948, it was one of the oldest in the
industrialised world. It was the primary reason why the Netherlands appears
consistently each year as the largest foreign investor in the US after Japan
and Britain.
Most such investment was in reality coming from other places, such as Hong
Kong, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America, which had no treaty
of their own with the US. This route saved them at least 20 per cent in
taxes. The changes mean it has almost dried up.
Reluctantly the Dutch agreed revised terms with the US last year under
threat of otherwise losing the continuation of any agreement. Now the US has
focused on other double tax agreements, including those with Denmark,
Luxembourg and Switzerland.
The risk among offshore centres is that rising competition will cause a
flight from quality in regulation and disclosure. However, Ms Doggart
suggests that the greater risk is that attempts by consultants to recommend
changes in line with the more successful centres will simply lead to a lack
of differentiation.
She adds that, ironically, more business is coming to those centres - such
as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man - which have toughened up their
regulation, improving inspections and limiting entry.
Ms Doggart is less concerned about the moral issues that may be involved in
those seeking to place assets or base operations in offshore centres. 'I
don't think morality comes into it, except when talking about drugs or money
laundering,' she says. 'As long as there's not universal tax harmonisation,
there will be havens.'
