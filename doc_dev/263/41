The Isle of Man government said in a report yesterday that responsibility
for financial services should be split off from its treasury into a new
department, and the island's industry and tourism departments should be
merged in a new trade and industry department.
The financial sector is the largest contributor to the island's economy, but
the government does not have a department responsible solely for its
affairs.
The report on economic strategy, compiled by the Central Economic Strategy
Unit under the chairmanship of Mr Terry Groves, a member of the House of
Keys - the lower of the island's two parliamentary chambers - produced 71
recommendations. They included setting up a companies division in the
island's High Court and appointing an experienced deemster (judge) for it.
The island, a self-governing Crown dependency of the UK, is financially
self-sufficient and, under its agreement with the UK, cannot go into budget
deficit.
Financial services and associated businesses and professions produce more
than a third of the island's income. There has been dissatisfaction in the
industry over the lack of government resources devoted to the sector.
The industry deals with the Manx government through the island's treasury
and regulatory bodies, which are supervised by the treasury.
The report proposes the establishment of an economic development committee
comprising ministers from the four revenue-raising departments: treasury,
financial services, agriculture and trade and industry.
Mr Miles Walker, the island's chief minister, said yesterday that the
government had already formed the committee. He said restructuring to create
new departments would take about two years.
The report was the first commissioned by the island's government to include
extensive private-sector involvement. Its recommendations include:
Negotiating double taxation agreements for the growing ship management
industry.
Negotiating bilateral agreements with European Union states for the sale of
Manx financial products.
Enacting clearer trust legislation.
Enhancing and focusing government marketing strategies.
Enacting more legislation in the island, rather than taking legislation
directly from the UK. Priority would be given to commercial legislation.
Examining ways to ensure better use of the workforce, such as retraining,
provision of childcare and incentives for businesses providing home work
schemes.
On residency the report says: 'It is not possible that growth and
development of the economy could be achieved without an increased labour
force and therefore a higher population level. But the ultimate objective is
for maximum national income at the minimum level of population.'
It recommended replacing the existing work permit system with identity
cards, which would be issued to residents who fulfil criteria - such as
long-term residence, birthright and key-worker status - which would be
varied according to the island's needs.
