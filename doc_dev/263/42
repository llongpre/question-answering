If you are a UK expatriate, you are entitled to receive gross interest from
your UK bank and building society after completing a form to declare your
non-resident status. But the ability to receive gross income does not mean
it is tax-exempt, since most UK sources of income are taxable.
The interest can only be excluded from liability to tax under
extra-statutory concession Bl3 but this involves considerable restrictions.
Donald Elkin, director of Wilfred T Fry Ltd, of Worthing, West Sussex,
points out that any interest you receive during 'broken' years of departure
from and arrival in the UK, will be fully taxable. Moreover, in intervening
years of non-residence, allowances will be set off against the gross paid
interest you thought was exempt.
If the interest is your only UK income, these will not be a problem. But if
you have other sources, such as a pension or are renting out property, Elkin
says you stand to suffer an unnecessary loss: 'Suppose, for example, that
while non-resident you receive UK letting profits of Pounds 3,400 per annum
and gross paid building society interest of Pounds 3,000. You might well
have assumed you would have no tax liability, the Pounds 3,000 interest
being exempt and the Pounds 3,400 letting profit fully covered by your
Pounds 3,445 personal allowance. In fact, that allowance will be set off
first against the interest, leaving only Pounds 445 to reduce the liability
on the letting profit. You would, therefore, have to pay tax on Pounds 2,955
(Pounds 3,400 minus Pounds 445) which at 25 per cent equals Pounds 738.75.'
Fortunately, this is a problem from which it is easy to escape simply by
transferring your account outside the UK. But it is always worth taking tax
advice before doing so.
Most UK banks and many building societies have offshore branches in the
Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. But remember the UK's Deposit Protection
Scheme for banks and building societies does not operate outside mainland
Britain, so it is important to stick to reputable depositors.
Of the three main offshore islands, only the Isle of Man has a comparable
scheme, which protects up to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. If you
are with a building society, the Building Societies Act requires all the
liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the UK parent.
