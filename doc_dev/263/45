Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, the ferry operator, yesterday announced a
38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 1.18m for
the six months to end-June.
The cost of establishing the Mannin Line, a freight service from Great
Yarmouth to Ijmuiden in the Netherlands, launched in November, helped
depress trading profit by 42 per cent to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.91m).
Turnover of the company, in which Sea Containers has a 41.97 per cent stake,
increased 5 per cent to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 11.9m) despite lower traffic
levels on the company's core Isle of Man routes.
Mr Juan Kelly, chairman, said: 'In a group sense it is the Mannin Line which
is pulling us down, but we have always said that was a long-term operation.'
Mannin results were in line with expectations with a steady improvement
throughout the period. Nearly two thirds of the loss was incurred in the
first quarter. Finance costs in the second half are expected to improve
after the Pounds 3.2m purchase of a ferry in August.
The introduction in June of a new SeaCat service on the Isle of Man routes
helped to boost total passenger carryings by 11 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 5.42p to 3.48p and the interim dividend is held
at 1.75p.
