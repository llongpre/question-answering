THE long-awaited report into the Pounds 42m collapse of the Savings and
Investment Bank on the Isle of Man 10 years ago can now be published, a
judge ruled yesterday.
The 500-page Chadwick report into the bank's crash was shelved until the
trial of two of its senior executives on fraud charges had been completed.
The report is likely further to embarrass the island's government over the
past standards of regulation of its offshore financial industry. Publication
is expected to open the way for ex-gratia payments to SIB depositors.
The government hopes that will enable the island - which now has one of the
toughest regulatory regimes in the world - to put the affair behind it.
Two years ago a Bank of England report into general supervisory standards on
the island was severely critical of Manx treasury officials. The Chadwick
report is also expected to criticise the officials.
Publication is expected on Tuesday after deletions ordered yesterday by
Deemster John Corrin, the Manx High Court's senior judge. He said the
deletions were minor and would not affect the thrust of the report.
He had received only one representation - from Fryers Bell, the island
accountants - that its name be erased from the report.
Depositors welcomed the decision, but criticised the Pounds 5,000 maximum
level of individual payments likely from a government fund of Pounds 4.45m.
Depositor protection schemes introduced on the island since the collapse
mirror those of the UK and allow for a Pounds 15,000 maximum individual
claim, with money levied from all other holders of banking licences on the
island.
