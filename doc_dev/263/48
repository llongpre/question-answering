SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry company, is free
to bid again for the Isle of Man Steam Packet, as the standstill agreement
concluded three months ago came to an end yesterday.
However, any bid would have to be almost double the 115p offered in its
first attempt to take the group in 1990. Steam Packet shares closed last
night at 200p, valuing the company at about Pounds 30m.
Mr Michael Stracey, Sea Containers' vice-president, said yesterday that all
options remained open. He refused to comment on whether Sea Containers
planned to bid for Steam Packet or increase its 41 per cent stake in the
Manx ferry operator.
According to Stock Exchange rules, Sea Containers can increase its holding
by 2 per cent a year, without launching a full bid.
Mr Stracey said little progress had been made in the talks, which were aimed
at strengthening the trading links between the two companies.
The main areas in the negotiations concerned: introducing Sea Containers'
high speed craft, the Sea Cat, on the Manx routes; reworking or extending
the agreement on Steam Packet's use of the Heysham port; using Steam
Packet's Lady of Mann vessel on Sea Container's Irish Sea route; and a joint
marketing agreement for ferry services. Mr Stracey said some progress had
been made in this last area.
Mr David Clague, of Baring Brothers, Steam Packet's financial advisers, said
the group was anxious that Sea Containers should clarify its position
regarding a possible bid. 'It is all a bit distracting,' he said.
