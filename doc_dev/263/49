THE ISLE of Man government yesterday announced a Budget for 1993-94 aimed at
stimulating economic growth while amending the income tax structure to help
those on lower incomes.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury minister, said his main objectives were
'to strengthen the foundations for the island's future prosperity'.
Net income for the year is estimated at Pounds 192.8m, an increase of 3.2
per cent, and net expenditure at Pounds 202m, the balance coming from funds
brought forward from the previous year. Capital spending is estimated at
Pounds 44.8m.
The island's reserve fund will remain at Pounds 65.29m. Mr Gelling said the
target was to increase this to half the government's annual expenditure. The
Pounds 4.26m interest earned by the fund and by the island's currency
account will be included in net income.
The two-tiered system of personal income taxation remains at 15 per cent and
20 per cent. Corporate and non-resident's tax remains at 20 per cent.
Personal income tax thresholds rise for the first time since 1989. A single
person's allowance is increased to Pounds 6,200 from Pounds 6,000, with
income tax at 15 per cent payable on the next Pounds 8,500 - an enlarging of
the band by Pounds 500 - and thereafter at 20 per cent. A married couple's
allowance is double that of a single person and is fully transferable
between partners.
The changes mean a single person earning Pounds 30,000 will pay income tax
of Pounds 4,335, compared with Pounds 6,942 in Britain.
Mr Gelling announced a review of residence rules relating to income-tax
liability of individuals. Both non-resident and tax-exempt Manx companies
face higher annual charges. These will be mitigated by removal of statutory
audit requirements. Annual duty on non-resident companies will rise by
Pounds 100 to Pounds 600 and annual fees for exempt companies by Pounds 50
to Pounds 300.
The proposed category of international companies and international limited
partnerships, due to be instituted later this year, will bear an annual tax
charge of Pounds 300 and a fee of Pounds 600 respectively.
The government also plans to amend pensions laws to attract international
pension fund management companies.
