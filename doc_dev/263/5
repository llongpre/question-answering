THE ISLE of Man government yesterday announced a Budget for 1993-94 aimed at
stimulating economic growth while amending the income tax structure to help
those on lower incomes.
Presenting his fourth Budget, Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury minister,
said his main objectives were 'to strengthen the foundations for the
island's future prosperity and to continue and strengthen action already
taken to develop employment opportunities'.
The Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency, has had income tax
autonomy from the UK since 1961 and is obliged to operate a budget surplus.
Net income for the year is estimated at Pounds 192.8m, an increase of 3.2
per cent, and net expenditure at Pounds 202m, the balance coming from funds
brought forward from the previous year. Capital spending is estimated at
Pounds 44.8m, including redevelopment of the hospital and airport, and a new
courthouse and general registry.
The island's reserve fund will remain at Pounds 65.29m. Mr Gelling said the
target was to increase this to half the government's annual expenditure. The
Pounds 4.26m interest earned by the fund and by the island's currency
account will be included in net income.
The two-tiered system of personal income taxation remains at 15 per cent and
20 per cent. Corporate and non-resident's tax remains at 20 per cent.
Personal income tax thres-holds rise for the first time since 1989. A single
person's allowance is increased to Pounds 6,200 from Pounds 6,000, with
income tax at 15 per cent payable on the next Pounds 8,500 - an enlarging of
the band by Pounds 500 - and thereafter at 20 per cent. A married couple's
allowance is double that of a single person and is fully transferable
between partners.
This means a single person earning Pounds 15,000 will pay income tax of
Pounds 1,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds 2,764 in the UK, at Pounds 30,000
income tax will be Pounds 4,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds 6,942 in the
UK and at Pounds 50,000 income Pounds 8,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds
14,942 in the UK.
Mr Gelling announced a review of residence rules relating to income tax
liability of individuals. Both non-resident and tax exempt Manx companies
will have their annual charges increased, but this will be mitigated by
removal of statutory audit requirements. Duty on non-resident companies will
increase by Pounds 100 to Pounds 600 per year and annual fees for exempt
companies by Pounds 50 to Pounds 300.
The proposed category of international companies and international limited
partnerships, due to be instituted later this year, will bear annually a tax
charge of Pounds 300 and a fee of Pounds 600 respectively. The island will
introduce roll-over relief for capital allowances on sales of ships and
aircraft which should benefit the growing Manx shipping register.
The government also plans to amend pensions laws to attract international
pension fund management companies to the island, but no details were given.
Among environmental measures the road tax rate for the smallest-engined
vehicles is unchanged and the rebate of 5p per gallon on unleaded petrol and
diesel is retained.
