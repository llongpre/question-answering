THE ISLE of Man government yesterday presented to Tynwald, the island's
parliament, a Budget designed to spread the benefits from the island's
thriving economy among less well-off residents and increase aid for business
ahead of the island's autumn general election.
The island, a crown dependency, has its own parliament and manages its own
financial arrangements, including setting its level of taxation.
The Manx government will give an initial allowance of 100 per cent on new
capital expenditure for industrial, tourist and agricultural buildings.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx treasury minister, said he wanted to assist
business, while 'seeking to ensure adequate funding for the provision of
enhanced public services and for assistance to the less well-off'.
