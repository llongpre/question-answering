FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: IoM Steam rises 56% to Pounds 1.91m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man Steam Packet Company is considering a reduction of passenger
services to the island in response to plans by the Isle of Man government to
build new facilities in Douglas harbour which would be open to competitors.
However, Mr Juan Kelly, chairman, reported along with the interim results
that talks were taking place with the government. He said the company was
willing to guarantee a level of services similar to the present in return
for a degree of protection from competition.
In the six months to end-June pre-tax profits for the company, in which Sea
Containers controls 41.97 per cent, advanced 56 per cent to Pounds 1.91m
(Pounds 1.23m) on turnover ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 11.3m).
The result was helped by the lack of exceptional items against Pounds
145,000 last time.
Earnings per share were 10.8p (7.1p) and the interim dividend is raised from
3p to 3.5p gross.
