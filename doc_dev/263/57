Expatriates and other non-residents coming to live in Britain will no longer
be subject to tax on income from investments made offshore before they
arrived in the UK, Barbara Ellis writes.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Friday that section 739 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act, a wide-ranging anti-avoidance provision, is limited
to people resident in the UK at the time of investing offshore.
The Inland Revenue said it believed the potential loss of revenue would be
Pounds 18m.
The ruling came in a case in which the Revenue had pursued Professor Peter
Willoughby for income tax on income accumulating on a Royal Life (Isle of
Man) investment bond.
Prof Willoughby, who taught law at the University of Hong Kong for some
years before 1987, originally invested in the Isle of Man bond while
resident in Hong Kong. But he was living in the UK when the original bond
matured, and he reinvested in 1989 and 1990 in similar bonds. Prof
Willoughby, now resident in Alderney, was supported in the court action by
Royal Life.
Mr Chris Lintott, solicitor for Prof Willoughby, said the decision
overturned previous practice and interpretations of legislation which were
virtually unchanged since 1936.
The Revenue said it was considering a Lords appeal.
