GIBRALTAR'S economic ambitions to become a significant player in the
offshore banking business are indisputable. Just as apparent are the
problems, which have nothing to do with finance, the British Crown Colony
faces in its bid to achieve this ambition.
The current situation, which has everything to do with politics, amounts to
a cruel paradox derived from the fact that Gibraltar is not geographically
offshore at all but linked by a narrow isthmus to Spain. This would not
necessarily matter were it not for the fact that Madrid claims sovereignty
over the Rock and therefore does everything within its power to deny it a
viable independent future.
The paradox is that while Gibraltar's officials and its banking and legal
community make an excellent case for the Rock as an international finance
centre, Madrid does its best to enforce isolation on the colony.
Telecommunications with Spain are appalling, Spanish custom officials ensure
interminable queues at the colony's frontier post with the mainland and
Madrid's diplomatic manoeuvring in the EC has effectively reduced
Gibraltar's regular air links with the outside world to trips to the United
Kingdom.
Such pressure has by no means prevented Gibraltar's success in building up
its economic muscle and its purposeful entry into the offshore business.
Gibraltar had four banks at start of the 1980s, 11 midway through that
decade and now has 30, 10 of which have offshore banking divisions. Total
bank assets stood at around Pounds 1bn three years ago and have now risen to
more than Pounds 2.5bn. Some 9,000 companies were registered on the Rock
four years ago and there are now more than 42,000.
According to the Gibraltar government's calculations the Rock now has 2 per
cent of the global offshore sector and the idea is to double this market
quota in the near future. An international consultancy, hired by the
Gibraltar government, is conducting an overall review of the policies
required to place the Rock solidly on the offshore map.
The offshore niche that the Rock has in its sights is emphatically located
in Europe. Gibraltar sees itself as a tax efficient base for business in the
EC.
'The Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Isle of Man, Jersey and the rest share
with us a relationship with the UK and have been in the offshore business
longer and more successfully than us,' says Mr Joe Bassano, Gibraltar's
chief minister. 'But none of them is a member of the EC like we are and that
is the special advantage we can offer.'
To the extreme irritation of the Spanish government which views the Rock
either as a British colony or as an integral part of Spain but never an
independent state, Mr Bassano likes to say that Gibraltar is 'de facto the
13th member of the Community'.
Exempted, by its membership terms, from the EC's fiscal system, Gibraltar
has a special jurisdiction, comparable to Luxembourg's and Dublin's, that
affords specific offshore possibilities.
Mr Michael Davidson, who runs Barclays Bank on the Rock, views Gibraltar's
peculiar EC status as its main selling point: 'We are one of the three
offshore centres within Europe and we are able therefore to sell fund
management products throughout the Community.' Bankers in Jersey and
Guernsey, in contrast, have to seek approval from the authorities in each
member state before they can trade such products.
There are additional pluses for the colony. 'There is more confidentiality
in general banking services in Gibraltar than on the Isle of Man,' says Mr
Jose Navarro, who runs the offshore banking divisions on the Rock for
Spain's premier bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. 'We can offer here the same as
Jersey but we can make it far more tailor-made.'
Gibraltar sells itself as better equipped to deal with the EC and also as
more receptive to the medium net worth individual. 'In Jersey I was solely
interested in people with Pounds 20m,' says one banker who moved from the
Channel Islands to the Rock. 'Here, if someone arrives with Pounds 1m, the
red carpet is rolled out.'
The attention that a Gibraltar-based bank will devote to its individual
client is mirrored by the goodwill that the institution itself receives from
a local government that is avidly encouraging the growth of the financial
sector. 'If a bank is going to create five jobs in Gibraltar then it is very
important to us,' says chief minister Bassano. 'A small investment elsewhere
represents a big one here.'
The review of Gibraltar's future as an offshore centre will focus on the
Rock's opportunities to offer fiscal breaks. 'It would be unrealistic to
believe that the EC will achieve total tax harmonisation,' says Mr William
Penman Brown, a former Guernsey banker who was recently appointed the
colony's Financial Services Commissioner. 'There will be little pockets like
Luxembourg and ourselves who will able to give (tax) advantages.'
It is unfortunate in this respect that the Spanish government should be
seeking to close off precisely the fiscal loopholes afforded by offshore
centres such as the Rock.
Draft legislation that aims to tax non-resident property owners in Spain
will hurt Gibraltar far more than other offshore centres because as Mr
Penman Brown puts it 'Gibraltar has so many eggs in the Spanish basket'. A
high proportion of the Rock-based companies created in recent years were
formed by wealthy foreigners seeking to avoid the Spanish taxman when buying
their Costa homes.
In the meantime, Spanish hostility to Gibraltar's offshore pretensions
effectively precludes the establishment on the Rock of meaningful corporate
business. According to Mr J E Triay, one of the Rock's most respected and
veteran lawyers, 'the influence of Spain is too great; Gibraltar cannot
become an offshore centre if Spain does not want it to.'
Put quite bluntly the long-term future of the Rock as a solid offshore
centre requires a radical change in its present political status in order to
accommodate Madrid. Ideally, Gibraltar should be to Spain what the Channel
Islands are to the UK. But Gibraltarians, virtually unanimously, reject such
a future.
