THE Isle of Man plans a budget deficit for 1992-93.
Announcing its budget yesterday, the Manx government said an estimated
increase in receipts of 5.9 per cent over last year to Pounds 190m would be
countered by expected net spending of Pounds 194.5m. Last year the surplus
was Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Donald Gelling, Manx treasury minister, said: 'The island has ridden the
UK recession well but there is certainly not the growth we have had in
recent years.'
The government will not borrow to meet the deficit. It will bring funds
forward from last year and use interest on the Pounds 64.75m reserves and
the government's current account.
Mr Gelling announced capital spending of Pounds 48m for the coming year.
This includes spending on the island's airport, the health service's estate,
community accommodation for the mentally handicapped and a new
meat-processing plant.
Encouragement is given to the local business community by introduction of a
temporary 10 per cent rebate on employers' National Insurance contributions,
to be reviewed after a year. The island will not introduce National
Insurance contributions on the benefit of cars and fuel.
Company fees are to be increased by 16 per cent, but the maximum fee for
company registration is cut from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 5,000 to attract
larger concerns to register in the island.
Income tax remains at 15 per cent on the first taxable Pounds 8,000 and 20
per cent thereafter for residents and 20 per cent on all taxable income for
non-residents and companies. Allowances will rise 6.2 per cent to Pounds
6,000 for a single person. The combined, fully transferable allowance for a
married couple will be Pounds 12,000.
