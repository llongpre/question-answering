If you are going across to the Channel Islands this summer, you could choose
to include among the various diversions on your itinerary, a brief visit to
one of the establishments for which they are famous.
Banks and building societies are ten-a-penny in Guernsey, Jersey and the
Isle of Man. They are the ideal spot for those who enjoy their tax havens to
dally.
The dalliance need not be confined to the wealthy and famous. Anyone with
savings in a UK bank or building society can seriously consider moving their
funds 'offshore', not just for the glamour of it but in pursuit of actual
tangible benefits.
Some of the highest onshore rates are found among postal accounts, but,
depending on the size of your deposit, it is often possible to secure higher
rates offshore.
One of the advantages of investing offshore is that interest is paid gross.
While UK residents are liable to tax on the interest, they have the
flexibility of delaying tax payment by as much as two years, depending on
whether interest is paid early in the tax year. That option effectively
increases the 'advertised' rate of interest. Moreover, many banks and
building societies pay a higher rate offshore than for an equivalent onshore
account.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's instant access onshore Gold Deposit account pays
3.25 per cent gross on Pounds 10,000, while its offshore instant access
Guernsey Gold pays 4.35 per cent gross on the same amount.
The society's London postal account (onshore) pays yearly interest of 5.45
per cent gross on Pounds 100,000 while the monthly interest rate on its
offshore Guernsey Gold account is 5.79 per cent gross.
Similarly, Portman Building Society, which has one of the most competitive
offshore rates, pays 5 per cent gross on Pounds 20,000 on its onshore
instant access account and 6.2 per cent gross on the equivalent amount
offshore.
The highest offshore rates are paid to expatriates.
Leeds Overseas has two instant access offshore accounts paying annual
interest.
Its Liquid Gold Overseas account for UK customers pays 5.1 per cent gross on
Pounds 100,000, while its Overseas Gold account, open only to expatriates,
pays 6.5 per cent on the same amount. The usual argument is that rates are
set in order to be competitive with other offshore institutions.
Although offshore does not necessarily mean shady, be wary of institutions
paying significantly higher rates of interest as you could be entering risky
waters.
It is also worth remembering that of the three main offshore islands, only
the Isle of Man has its own deposit protection scheme.
The UK's building societies Deposit Protection Scheme, which guarantees to
pay 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 in an account, does not apply
outside mainland Britain. However, the Building Societies Act requires all
the liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the parent.
