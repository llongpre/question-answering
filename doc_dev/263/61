FT  22 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Understanding taxation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under a previous arrangement between the UK and Manx Tax authorities, double
taxation relief was dealt with by the Manx Assessor of Income Tax under an
Extra Statutory Arrangement. Because of changes made by the UK Authority, I
am informed that this arrangement has been set aside and I must now
personally claim relief from the Inland Revenue.
As I do not understand how double taxation works I should be glad if you
could tell me about any publication which would explain the operation
simply.
Write to the Inland Revenue Claims Branch (International), St John's House,
Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside, L69 9BB, explaining that you want to claim
the personal allowance and tax credit relief due as an Isle of Man resident.
It will be helpful if you tell them your Manx tax reference and the types of
income which you derive from the UK. You could also ask them for the free
pamphlet on double taxation relief, IR6.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
