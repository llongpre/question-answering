FT  15 FEB 93 / Satellite TV 'in 2m homes'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of UK homes with satellite dishes was 2.015m by the end of 1992
according to the German-based research company GfK, whose figures exclude
Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
Its assessment is lower than the latest Barb figures (from February 1),
showing 2.323m installed dishes throughout the UK. Those from Continental
Research estimate 2.596m dishes, again across the UK. As many as 60,000
dishes are believed to be installed in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man.
