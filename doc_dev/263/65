OPERATIONS OF Merlin International Properties, which faces possible
receivership, are to be investigated by the Isle of Man fraud squad.
'I have no reason at this moment to believe there has been criminal
activity,' Mr William Cain, the Manx Attorney General, said yesterday. The
investigation was ordered after some shareholders complained about heavy
losses by the company and circumstances surrounding a recent takeover bid
for it.
A Pounds 2.9m agreed offer of 5p per share from Luirc, a British Virgin
Islands company, was announced at the end of February. The bid failed to get
Stock Exchange approval because its funding was conditional, and was
withdrawn two weeks ago.
Luirc is still keen to mount a further bid if it can get dispensation from
the takeover panel. A further bid from the same source would not normally be
allowed within 12 months of collapse of the first one.
Some of Merlin's Manx-based private shareholders say the identity of the
bidder has not been made clear, and suspect some past or present directors
may be acting in concert with the bidder. Luirc has stated that there was no
connection between it and Merlin directors.
