Loganair, the subsidiary of Airlines of Britain which operates services
between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands and Islands, is
believed to be close to a buy-out by its management.
The airline is also expected to announce that it will enter into a franchise
agreement with British Airways, which flies to some of Loganair's
destinations. This would give Loganair access to BA's reservations system
and shield it from destructive competition from its rival.
The buy-out of Loganair is expected to be led by Mr Scott Grier, the
airline's managing director.
Airlines of Britain owns British Midland Airways and the Isle of Man-based
Manx Airlines as well as Loganair. Last month Loganair handed its routes to
destinations outside Scotland to Manx Airlines in order to concentrate on
its services to the Highlands and Islands.
Aircraft and staff were transferred from Loganair to Manx Airlines. Although
170 people lost their jobs all services operated by the two airlines were
retained.
