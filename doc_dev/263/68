When the UK entered the European Community it negotiated a special
relationship with the community for Jersey and its other two Crown
dependencies, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.
The islands are not full members but under the arrangement their traditional
right of free trade in manufactured and agricultural goods with the UK is
extended to all EU countries. But they retain their fiscal autonomy and
their long-established right to self government.
They are outside the EU with regard to free movement of people, free trade
in services and fiscal harmonisation. EU directives on taxation do not apply
to Jersey which has no valued added tax, and is treated as a third country
in this respect.
Jersey remains enthusiastic and confident about the arrangement, seeing far
more advantages than disadvantages. Mr. Colin Powell, chief adviser to the
States, says: 'There are inevitably pluses and minuses with any arrangement
of this nature, but it is considered that the pluses continue to heavily
outweigh the minuses. As far as Jersey is concerned there is no pressure for
any change in the relationship - the arrangement continues to be seen as the
best option for the island.'
But the island keeps a close watch on movements within the EU and retains a
law firm in Brussels as its adviser. Senior Jersey politicians and
executives make annual visits to Brussels and twice-yearly visits to the UK
Home Office for discussions about Europe.
Senator Reg Jeune of the Policy and Resources Committee, a Jersey politician
for more than 30 years, says: 'Nobody feels we should change from the
decisions made years ago; our position has been a fortunate one.
'It will be a long time before Europe really gets its act together and it
will be a looser monster than first thought. It helps us that it is not so
tight. But there will be problems for the island and we have to constantly
keep our finger on the pulse.'
Senator Jeune explained that islanders felt more offshore Europe than
offshore UK. While he acknowledges that Jersey fund managers would like
easier access to Europe, he does not see any real hindrance to the island's
finance industry in general by not being a full member state.
'Providing we keep our nose clean and put in place all the laws for a
respectable finance industry,' he added.
Mr. Clive Barton, senior partner in the Jersey office of accountancy firm
Moore Stephens, said: 'Jersey's finance industry sees Europe as a large
market for the island, and an area of work that will grow. The island's
authorities have been travelling to introduce themselves to the European
market.
'However, we might miss out because we have no tax treaties with Europe and
a lot of European advisers are heavily into treaty shopping.'
Mr. Barton said his firm had dealt with substantial trusts and their
accompanying bank balances for a number of Europeans who view Switzerland as
less attractive. 'There is a lot of high net worth private trust business to
be done there. It appeals more than a Swiss bank account, where difficulties
may be encountered in claiming money after the account holder's death.'
He said the island's lack of VAT caused a problem for European companies
trading with another European country and wishing to dog-leg the transaction
through an offshore company. He usually recommends the Isle of Man, which
does have VAT, for these purposes.
'But this is not a reason for Jersey to institute VAT,' he added.
The island's agricultural industry remains the area most affected by the EU.
Mr. Powell said: 'While the industry had ensured access to its traditional
UK market, with the accession of the UK to the EC that market was opened up
to competition from producers in the member states. That competition was
increased further with the subsequent accession of Spain and Portugal to the
community.
'The island is obliged to comply with European rules on hygiene and
production regarding produce it sells to the UK or other European countries.
However it is not obligatory for the island to implement directives if no
trade is to be undertaken.'
But Jersey's small fishing industry - with a total annual catch valued at
Pounds 4.5m - has run into problems. Jersey boats traditionally land catches
in both the UK and France. But French fishermen have interrupted market
access to their country by blockading ports. The last such incident was only
a few weeks ago.
Jersey has only a three-mile territorial water limit, but it is attempting
to get this extended to a six-mile exclusive fishing limit around its coast.
It is also negotiating with France to replace the old agreements on access.
Senator Jeune says: 'We are trying to have much more contact with France, as
our nearest neighbour. It is sad about this latest fisheries incident
because it could strain the relationship.'
