   A ferryworkers union in Liverpool and the Isle of
Man, whose dispute sparked a national strike, reached a tentative
agreement Saturday to return to work, a union spokesman said.
   Roger Wilkins, deputy general secretary of the National Union of
Seamen, said he expected the workers to approve the agreement with
the Isle of Man Steam Packet Co. and return to work Sunday.
   The strike, begun at the end of December, led to a nationwide
walkout Feb. 2 that crippled ferry service at 12 ports. The High
Court ruled the strike illegal.
   Union leader Sam McCluskie had ordered men who were striking in
support of their Isle of Man colleagues to return to work, but said
other seamen striking because of their own local grievances could
stay out.
   Sealink company crews at the ports of Holyhead, Liverpool and
Fleetwood, and P and O crews at Dover, have remained on strike. The
agreement would not affect their walkout.
   Wilkins said management, which had wanted to lay off 80 of its
161 crewmen in economy moves, agreed to fire 47.
   ``I think the members will accept it, because we have got the
best possible deal in the circumstances,'' Wilkins said.
