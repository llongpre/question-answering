THE Isle of Man's financial services sector continues to expand and develop.
It produces more than 30 per cent of the Manx gross national product (GNP)
compared to 21 per cent 10 years ago.
For companies and institutions seeking an offshore base close to the UK the
Isle of Man has a significant advantage - it still has lots of space.
The island's 220 square miles contain only 70,000 people, about half of whom
live in or close to Douglas. There are large tracts of land uninhabited. The
commercial property market is healthy and purpose-built offices in new
developments can be rented for around Pounds 14 per square foot.
No restrictions are placed on the size of businesses and this has led some
institutions and firms to locate there rather than the Channel Islands where
physical expansion is very difficult. But the Manx authorities do closely
examine the quality and reputation of any company wishing to set up. A work
permit is needed for employees moving to the island and for their first five
years residency. The island's scenic beauty, low crime rate and good
education and health services make it a pleasant place to live so businesses
can attract high calibre personnel. The finance sector employs more than
4,000 people, 14 per cent of the island's available workforce.
However, the finance community feels visiting business men or women do not
fare so well. Apart from the Heathrow daily route, air services to the
island are generally considered infrequent and inconveniently timed. Air
fares are also higher than on most UK routes. There is no first class hotel
and though service in hotels and restaurants comes with a smile, seasoned
travellers find it slow and often poor. Another plus for the Isle of Man is
its standards of regulation of financial services. Though most islanders
cringe at the mention of the Savings and Investment Bank crash of 1982,
there is little doubt this disaster created an awareness of the need for
sound regulation and supervision.
In 1983, the Financial Supervision Commission was created. Since its
inception it has doggedly pursued a policy of instituting regulation that
offers the best protection to the investor, while not proving too onerous
for the practitioner.
The FSC's abilities were well proven by the collapse of BCCI, which had a
branch in the island.
In February 1991 the Isle of Man instituted a depositor protection scheme,
little realising how soon after it would be utilised. In the event of a
participating bank's failure each of the other participating banks, at
present 51, is liable to pay to the fund one eighth of 1 per cent of its
deposit liabilities. A minimum payment of Pounds 25,000 and a maximum of
Pounds 250,000 have been set for any one year. When the Bank of England
ordered the closure of BCCI branches the scheme swung into action and is
expected to fund about Pounds 22m over the next three years.
While proud of its regulation and supervision, the island is far from
complacent in its attitude to new business. The decline of tourism and
agriculture as contributors to the GNP means financial services and
manufacturing need to be strengthened to ensure economic viability for the
island. The single European market is not regarded as a threat because the
Manx client base is worldwide.
There are 11 life assurance companies based in the island with products
mostly tailored to meet the needs of expatriates of various nationalities.
Their main markets are the Middle and Far East. But the high net worth
individual and the international investor are now also targeted in a new
range of products. Captive insurance continues to grow and 112 captives are
registered in the Isle of Man. Among these is Northern Shipping Insurance of
Arkhangelsk in Russia, the first captive to come out of the eastern bloc.
Businesses feel the break-up of the Soviet Union will lead to more financial
business coming to the west from that area.
Ship registration is also on the increase. Five years ago there were 76
ships registered in the island and eight marine administration companies.
Now there are 128 ships and 23 companies.
Trust and company formation has always been the backbone of offshore tax
planning and was traditionally handled by lawyers and accountants. As the
volume of work increased banks and other professionals set up specialist
companies to deal with it. There are now 32 trust administration companies
in the island.
The Manx government led the way among offshore jurisdictions when it
announced last year plans to legislate for the regulation of company
formation businesses. It is a complex field involving high levels of
confidentiality and it appears the most likely route taken will be to
license practitioners and apply a code of conduct. A further incentive was
added for fund managers at the end of last year. From April 6, 1992 resident
fund managers will have tax payable on their annual fee income reduced from
20 per cent to 5 per cent. Initially this tax break will extend until 2005.
