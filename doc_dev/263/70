OFFSHORE accounts sound glamorous and, no doubt, some people put their money
in the Channel Islands to feel richer than they are. But, for UK building
society savers, there are still good reasons to consider opening one.
The market is relatively new for societies and many have established
offshore subsidiaries only in the past few years - although some, such as
the Halifax, have had an offshore presence for longer.
Such accounts, which pay interest gross, are aimed mainly at expatriates but
non-taxpaying UK residents needed them before the abolition of
composite-rate tax in April 1991. This tax was deducted at source in the UK
and could not be reclaimed by non-taxpayers. Now it has gone, so has the
main need by UK residents for an offshore account.
Since they must declare their income to the Inland Revenue regardless of
where it is held, is there much point now in putting money in an offshore
building society account? One reason can be found in the table, which
compares rates paid on an instant access offshore account at the top 10 UK
building societies with the corresponding onshore account.
In most cases, the gross rate is higher on the offshore account. Halifax's
Jersey-based Deposit International, for example, offers 6.5 per cent gross
on Pounds 10,000 compared with 5.6 per cent on its Instant Xtra Plus onshore
account.
Its onshore rate is bettered offshore by 1.35 percentage points on sums over
Pounds 50,000, while National &amp; Provincial pays 8 per cent gross on Pounds
100,000 or more in its Isle of Man-based Independent Reserve account,
compared with 6.5 per cent onshore.
One reason for higher rates is due to the funding of offshore subsidiaries.
Guy Stephenson, operations manager of Woolwich Guernsey, explains: 'We
collect sterling and dollar deposits world-wide and lend sterling deposits
to the society on the mainland. They pay us a rate for the money, which has
to be a market rate.' Overheads on offshore subsidiaries also tend to be
lower, since they often are smaller and have fewer staff than mainland
offices.
Societies such as Bristol &amp; West, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester already have the benefit of low overheads with their postal
accounts, and are not able to better these rates offshore (although those
investing Pounds 100,000 or more in C&amp;G's Guernsey Gold account will get a
better return offshore).
Another reason for putting money offshore is that, although a tax liability
cannot be avoided, it can be delayed. depending on your timing.
Take Alliance &amp; Leicester's Maximum Instant account, which is paying 6.75
per cent gross on a Pounds 50,000 deposit. Like most of the onshore
accounts, it offers a choice of dates for crediting interest. You can choose
April 1 or May 1, depending on your tax year.
If you chose May 1 1992, and declared the interest on your 1992-93 tax
declaration form next year, you would then be unlikely to have to pay tax on
it until the first half of 1994 - although the exact timing depends on your
tax office.
Some societies differentiate between expatriate accountholders and those
based in the UK. Leeds, for example argues that paying higher rates on its
Liquid Gold Overseas account would take business away from its UK parent.
Its Overseas Gold account, open only to expatriates, offers a higher rate to
compete with other offshore institutions.
You do not have to be particularly rich to go offshore: the minimum
investment in Leeds Permanent's Liquid Gold Overseas account is Pounds 25,
and Pounds 500 for a Woolwich international account. But some societies
require much higher sums: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester demands Pounds 10,000
minimum for its Guernsey Gold account.
The UK's Building Societies Deposit Protection Scheme, which guarantees to
pay 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 in an account, does not apply
outside mainland Britain. Of the three main offshore islands, only the Isle
of Man has its own scheme. Under this, deposits are protected up to 75 per
cent of the first Pounds 20,000, and building societies also are covered by
the scheme.
However, section 22 of the 1986 Building Societies Act requires all the
liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the parent.
Should that parent go bust, savers would not be covered by the Building
Societies Deposit Scheme. In the past, though, troubled building societies
have been taken over rather than allowed to collapse.
