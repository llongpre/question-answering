   History is repeating itself on
the Isle of Man as William the Conqueror and his cohorts prepare
once again for the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
   Only this time William will be an actor wearing chain mail and
there will be television cameras looking on, reporting the war as
it happens.
   With an 11-week shoot on 18 European locations, ``Timeline'' is
using on-camera reporters and an anchorman, all played by
professional actors, to turn the distant past into the stuff of
today's nightly news.
   ``It's a way to give history the immediacy and excitement of a
fast-breaking news story,'' said Leo Eaton, the director and
executive producer.
   The six-hour $2.2 million series applies the tenets of broadcast
news to over 400 years of medieval history.
   The show, featuring about 280 speaking parts and up to 5,000
extras, is to be aired on public television in the United States in
January and later on Britain's Channel 4.
   ``It's dramatized but it's not drama; it's history, but it's not
a history lesson,'' Eaton said in an interview before flying to the
Isle of Man, a picturesque if blustery island in the Irish Sea 30
miles west of England.
   In the present segment, the first to be shot, it's September 25,
1066, and the Manx village of Peel, population 2,500, is standing
in for the French coastal town of St. Valery-sur-Somme.
   The Norman duke, William, is waiting for the winds to change so
that his troops can sail across the English Channel and fight the
Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066.
   ``Everybody's sitting about bored, ready to go,'' said
production designer Peter Wooley, as a motley group of local extras
and actors rehearsed their scenes amid the ruins of a hilltop
castle on the island's western coast.
   ``In the pivotal scene, the wind does change,'' Wooley said.
``Instead of William the Conqueror, he should have been called
William the Lucky.''
   The series will cover such events as the Black Death, which
wiped out one-third of the world populace during the 14th and 15th
centuries, and the conquest of Istanbul, then Constantinople, in
1453.
   Eaton said he avoided recent events in choosing what to
dramatize.
   ``We first set down the parameters to cover the coming of
Christianity and the Roman Empire up to the Industrial
Revolution,'' said the director, an Oxford graduate who began his
career as a tea-boy on the set of the hit TV series ``The
Avengers.''
   ``Beyond that, history gets complicated; you can no longer
simplify it in quite this way.''
   The show's historical adviser, Janet Meisel, disagreed: ``A
medievalist would say the further back you go, the more complicated
history gets.''
   She said the complications make history interesting.
   ``We are lulled by similarities in thinking, `Ah yes, they
(historical figures) are just like us,' but they really weren't,''
said Meisel, wrapped in a scarf and a winter coat against the
coastal chill.
   ``The past is not like the present; that's what makes it a
useful intellectual exercise.''
   On sabbatical from the University of Texas at Austin, where she
is a professor of medieval history, Meisel said she approved of the
show's efforts to make history accessible.
   ``I know there are some historians who really object to the
idea,'' she said. ``(But) I guess my feeling is that history is so
badly taught, as long as we have the football coach or the
basketball coach _ whichever one isn't teaching English _ teach
history, I'd like to see history that looks right and is right and
entertaining.''
   Meisel said her task was to verify matters ranging from
historical methodology to horns.
   ``Did Vikings remove the horns on cattle or not?'' she said.
``We have this pseudo-Viking from a university whose particular
field is agricultural animals in the Middle Ages who's saying you
cannot have lopped-off horns.
   ``But I can show you Anglo-Saxon laws where people were in fact
required to lop off the horns of cattle so you do not gore your
neighbors, or your neighbors' cattle.''
   For locals such as blacksmith David Daley, ``Timeline'' is an
opportunity to recreate his real-life profession on-screen.
   ``It's good fun; the island could do with something like this to
put it on the map,'' the 42-year-old Daley said.
   His wife, Gillian, has a bit part in the show as well, playing
what Daley described as ``a lusty maiden, or something.''
   Co-producer Gary Witt had nothing but praise for his cast:
   ``We're smearing mud on their costumes, and they're letting us
do it. God love 'em,'' he said.
