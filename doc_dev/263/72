FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Evasion - or avoidance?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
We have a deposit account with an English building society on the Isle of
Man, primarily to receive interest before tax is deducted. Would it be legal
 -that is, tax avoidance rather than tax evasion - if, when the interest was
due, we travelled to the island, withdrew the interest and spent the money
there? And would we need to declare the amount of interest spent on our next
tax return?
You forgot to tell us where you and your husband are domiciled. If, as well
as being resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, you and your husband
are domiciled in England and Wales (or in Scotland or in Northern Ireland),
then you are liable to pay UK tax on the Manx interest regardless of whether
or not it is remitted to the mainland.
On the other hand, if (despite being resident and ordinarily resident in the
UK) you and your husband are domiciled somewhere else, you would not have to
pay UK tax on the interest.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
