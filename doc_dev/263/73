Shoprite, the discount food retailer, yesterday unveiled an ambitious
expansion plan following an 88 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the
year to October 31.
The company said that profits of Pounds 5.08m (Pounds 2.7m) would enable it
to open at least 50 new stores over the next 12 months, almost doubling its
size.
The group, based in the Isle of Man, said improved turnover of Pounds 164m
(Pounds 87.5m) showed demand was rising for its discount outlets in
Scotland, where it already has 66 stores.
Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman and joint managing director, said: 'We believe
our trading format is capable of sustaining at least 200 stores in Scotland
by 1996 with the potential for a similar number in northern England.'
He said the expansion would be financed from the group's own resources and
borrowing.
Disposals and leaseback transactions helped raise Pounds 5.6m, which, after
the acquisition of 30 new stores, left the group with Pounds 1.8m cash in
hand compared with Pounds 288,000 last time.
Gearing, currently 51 per cent, is expected to exceed 60 per cent next year.
Mr Nicholson, whose father Ken was a co-founder of the Kwik Save discount
chain, said the balance sheet had been strengthened by a Pounds 9.7m rights
issue in January and the expansion would not require another placement.
The improved performance last year mainly reflected double-figure percentage
growth at the 33 stores operating in Scotland for the whole 12 months.
On the Isle of Man, however, the retail, property and vehicle retailing
interests proved less buoyant.
Discount supermarkets on the island were performing only satisfactorily,
while trading conditions for its Mercedes-Benz dealership remained
'extremely difficult'.
Earnings per share jumped from 3.77p to 5.64p.
The proposed final divided is increased to 1.6p, making a total for the year
of 2.2p (1.5p adjusted).
The shares rose 8p to close at 178p.
