FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Where low
overheads spell value for money - Investing offshore, building societies /
UK tax reform means that the advantages to savers are fewer, but bargains
are still available to those who plan carefully

Building societies are redolent with security. Trust in these worthy
institutions is embedded deep in the British psyche.
'Offshore', on the other hand, is regarded with the deepest suspicion.
Mainly as a result of affairs such as Barlow Clowes, off-shore tax havens
seem to be havens for crooks and frauds.
Consequently investors are often a little perplexed to know why building
societies have dipped into such apparently murky waters.
But hard work by the financial authorities on the UK's three main 'offshore'
centres - Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man - has cut down on the level
of financial crime. Meanwhile, UK legislation means that offshore building
societies are as 'secure' in the event of the society failing as their
parent companies on the mainland.
In the event of collapse, the 1986 Building Societies Act requires the
parents societies to guarantee 100 per cent of the liabilities of its
offshore subsidiary, with no ceiling on the amount payable to individual
savers.
No building societies have collapsed this century, so the issue should be
academic, but this is actually stronger compensation than is available on
the mainland - where the statutory compensation scheme would pay out 90 per
cent of the deposit, up to a maximum of Pounds 18,000 per person. The Isle
of Man also has its own investor-protection scheme.
So there is no great reason why investors should avoid offshore building
society accounts. A more relevant question is: 'Why bother?' Recent reforms
of the UK taxation system have made this rather tougher to answer.
The big 'plus' of offshore financial centres is that funds are free of tax,
allowing interest to be paid gross. When 'composite rate tax' was levied on
all UK bank and building society accounts, irrespective of what level of
income tax the account-holder paid, this gave offshore accounts a great
attraction. Non-taxpayers could avoid losing more than a fifth of their
income, just by placing their funds off-shore. The introduction of
independent taxation for husbands and wives gave the offshore societies a
further boost, as couples took advantage of the new tax-planning
opportunities.
Now, interest is payable gross on onshore accounts for non-taxpayers.
Further, interest earned offshore is still taxable for those liable to tax
on onshore accounts. The offshore accounts have therefore lost their old
financial advantage.
However, the societies point out that opportunities for financial planning
still exist, because tax on interest earned does not have to be paid
immediately. Careful planning should allow investors to earn extra interest
before they finally pay tax - an option not available onshore.
The offshore societies also compete on two other factors - service, and
value-for-money.
All of these societies are small one-branch operations, with low overheads
as a result. Most of their business is postal, as the vast majority of their
customers are not resident on the islands.
All the three main offshore centres have developed a small financial
industry, ensuring that all can recruit experienced staff. Thus, they hope
to be both swift and efficient.
The low overheads should also allow them to compete on price with their
mainland rivals, who must offer a wider range of products, and maintain a
costly branch network.
Comparisons of some leading societies' onshore and offshore rates, using
figures drawn from the January edition of Moneyfacts, suggest that there is
strength in this argument.
For example, the Alliance &amp; Leicester offers 4.60 per cent on an instant
access account with a balance of at least Pounds 50,000 on the mainland.
Offshore, the 'Manximum' instant access account offers 6.0 per cent for the
same balance.
On balances of Pounds 100,000, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Channel Islands'
Guernsey Gold account will offer 6.2 per cent, compared with 4.0 per cent on
the society's equivalent Cheltenham Gold instant access account and 5.7 per
cent on the postal London Share account.
Derbyshire's Isle of Man account offers 7.00 per cent on instant access for
balances of Pounds 50,000, compared with the maximum of 5.00 per cent
available from the society on the mainland.
However, offshore bargains like this need to be searched for carefully. Many
other societies, such as the Halifax, make little or no difference between
the rates available offshore and on the mainland.
The very top rates at any one time, for those prepared to shop around using
the Weekend FT's Highest Rates for Your Money table, compiled by Moneyfacts,
are usually roughly comparable, with neither onshore nor offshore accounts
having an overall advantage.
Expatriates stand to gain the most from offshore accounts. The societies are
geared to their needs in any case, but, most important, onshore building
societies are now getting nervous about paying interest gross to
expatriates, for fear of falling foul of the Inland Revenue if their
customers return to the UK. This makes offshore accounts much more
administratively simple for the expatriate Briton.
