goes offshore to find homes with the promise of an independent and peaceful
life

For an independent life, it is hard to beat the offshore islands of the
British Isles. The pace is slower and the need for self-sufficiency greater
 -in case storms stop the ferry and the aeroplanes.
On the Isle of Wight, the 'old fogey' retired locals at Bembridge go to
ground in the summer, to emerge in September for hunting and shooting.
'There is a splendid hunt which rarely catches a fox but gives a lot of
people a lot of pleasure,' I was told.
Out of season, Bembridge is a joy even if, in summer, it is a playground for
the champagne and sailing set. 'But all the same, it is fun to have them
around,' a local says.
Seaview and Cowes are the other main haunts for smart sailors. In the 1980s,
many of them stopped going to the island and went to France and the
Mediterranean instead. Now, they are staying closer to home. Why? School
fees and Lloyd's are thought to have some relevance.
The car ferries can be a problem and many people leave their vehicles on the
mainland, at Portsmouth Harbour station, and take the fast catamaran to Ryde
pier. There are also hovercraft on the crossing. A tunnel to the island,
much talked-about, might happen one day - but Eurotunnel will need to
succeed first.
For farmers needing to get animals to market and the slaughterhouse, a
tunnel would be a blessing. The local abattoir closed in 1992; now,
Salisbury is the closest. Since the trip is expensive, it is not surprising
that several farms are for sale.
Yet, it is a gentle life for the residents - 'rather like Ireland,' as one
described it. Indeed, the last really big event was D-Day and the
preparations for it. Some want more visitors, and to encourage pop concerts.
But many like it because it is quiet.
Dolphin House, a sailor's property at Wootton Bridge with its own mooring,
slipway and pontoon, has just been sold by Humberts (with Christopher
Scott); it had a guide price of Pounds 380,000. On offer from Fox in
Newport, however, are several attractive old cottages between Pounds 130,000
and Pounds 150,000. The old Ashey station - now a red brick house with six
bedrooms and an Aga - costs Pounds 135,000 and still has the Isle of Wight
Steam Railway running past.
In Ryde Coromandel (11 Bellevue Road) is a stuccoed Regency villa with a
semi-circular drawing room with verandah outside. It has a vaguely colonial
look: somewhere to drink gin in a wicker chair and tap the barometer. Did a
sea captain build it? The price from Fox is Pounds 135,000.
In Cowes, Mariners House - on offer from Scott for Pounds 380,000 - is on
the waterfront and has three 'crew rooms' in the attic (ideal for an ocean
racing team or a large family) and splendid views of the Solent.
For Pounds 235,000, Fox's Shanklin office is selling Sandford House,
substantial and Victorian, in Sandford village.
For Pounds 320,000, Scott and Hamptons offer jointly Horringford House, a
Queen Anne property with barns, a cottage and a lake. William Cromwell lived
here, grandson of Oliver and heir to Richard as Lord Protector. 'WMC 1718'
is on a stone over the front door.
The Isle of Man is famous for kippers (with no artificial dye) and fresh
fish. 'My parents can never eat English fish,' says a Manx friend. And it is
almost always raining which, as we all know, is good for the garden.
The landscape is a rich mixture of mountains, glens, waterfalls and beaches.
Only the noisy din of the Tourist Trophy motorcycle races interrupts the
quiet from time to time.
In this rural haven, crime is low.
There has been some resentment of settlers from Britain, known as
'come-overs'. Some are the super-rich attracted by income tax at 20 per cent
and no capital gains or inheritance tax; this has produced a two-tier
society, and smart restaurants.
The property market is cheerier than a year ago. The financial sector in
Douglas is now hiring locals as well as outsiders; this is helping the whole
island economy, according to estate agent Chrystals. Come-overs will often
be looking for a house costing upwards of Pounds 200,000. Among the
islanders, there are more first-time buyers.
There is some movement in the market for the most expensive houses. Dean
Wood recently sold Ballacriy Manor in Colby, a neo-Georgian stately home
with pediment and columns, for Pounds 850,000.
But The Nunnery, racehorse owner Robert Sangster's glorious Victorian Gothic
house - complete with a chapel where services are still held - remains on
the market. The price from Dean Wood and Aylesford is Pounds 3.5m, compared
with the original figure of more than Pounds 5m.
For Pounds 700,000, Chrystals offers Middle Garth at Marown. This solid,
large farmhouse comes with 22 acres and a guest/granny cottage. The rates
are an incredibly cheap Pounds 291.
Glen Truan at Bride, with 13 acres and views across the Ayres to a distant
Scotland at the north tip of the island, is on offer from Chrystals at
Pounds 295,000. The agent is also selling the white-painted Corris's Croft
at The Garey, near Ramsey, for Pounds 350,000; and the Spanish-style Villa
Carina, near Maughold, for Pounds 365,000.
The Scilly Isles, warmed by the Gulf Stream, are a gardener's delight and a
place of beauty and calm, with few houses. 'They are like Cornwall but
better,' says Tony Dingley of Island Properties.
Eighty people live on the small island of St Agnes, which is linked by boat
to St Mary's. In turn, that has mailboat and helicopter connections to
Penzance, and an aeroplane to St Just, at Land's End.
There is a pub on St Agnes but no hotel.
The beaches are marvellous and traffic hardly exists. Miller and Island
Properties jointly offer a 52-year lease (from the Duchy of Cornwall) on
Barnaby Cottage, with its own mooring, for Pounds 199,950.
On St Martin's, most north-easterly of the Scillies, Island Properties is
selling Bleak House - an old farmhouse with palm trees in the garden - for
Pounds 160,000, and the 1822 Rock House for Pounds 150,000. The rock is
granite.
