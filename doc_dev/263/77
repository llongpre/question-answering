An Isle of Man court yesterday froze assets of five companies alleged to be
involved in bribing Russian officials to rig the New York strategic metals

Interlink Metals and Chemicals, of New York, against ICD Merchandise,
registered in Delaware. ICD trades in New York and has been renamed
Industrial Products.
Interlink claimed Dollars 75m damages in the New York court for loss of
business. It claims that ICD sought to monopolise the New York market in
Russian metals by paying bribes to agents of Russian trading companies. The
bribes were paid through a web of British Virgin Islands companies set up in
