Nimble-footed investors make some of their best gains by switching in and
out of world stock markets when they are at their most volatile.
In order to shelter these profits from the taxman, an increasing number are
making use of offshore single-premium insurance bonds. In fact, the bonds
have become so popular that the Pounds 2bn market is expected to double in
size over the next two years as more life insurance companies jump on to the
bandwagon.
The big attraction of offshore single-premium insurance bonds is that
investors can switch between the individual life company's offshore funds
without crystalising any tax charge and, generally speaking, accumulate
income and gains tax-free.
These fiscal privileges are allowed, because the bond has been turned into a
life insurance vehicle, and therefore the income or gains are judged to
belong to the bond rather than the individual. In reality, the life-cover
element is usually only a nominal 1 per cent of the investment premium.
Clive Cowdery, managing director of the Dublin-based J. Rothschild
International, describes the offshore single-premium bond as a protective
wrapper around a collection of funds.
He adds: 'Many investors want to reposition their portfolios and switch the
geographic weightings in the light of changing circumstances. But the
prospect of having to pay tax on the gains every time acts as a deterrent,
and tax therefore plays a part in what should be a pure investment decision.
Hence the offshore insurance bond.'
There is another important tax break attached to the offshore bond. Cowdery
explains: 'The Inland Revenue extends certain UK tax privileges to policies
issued from offshore centres such as the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands,
Dublin and Luxembourg. Under the 5 per cent rule, investors can withdraw 5
per cent of the initial value of the bond 'income' tax free. For instance,
if the capital investment was Pounds 100,000 the investor could take Pounds
5,000 a year. The 5 per cent concession can be carried forward over a number
of tax years, and this is a particular advantage to those who have not yet
retired.'
The choice and range of offshore funds available varies between life
companies, and the minimum investment is generally around Pounds 100,000. J.
Rothschild International, for example, offers its own in-house range of 22
unit-linked funds, and investors are allowed up to 20 free switches a year.
Other insurance companies in the offshore single-bond market, such as
Clerical Medical, Eagle Star and AXA Equity &amp; Law, also offer their own in-
house funds.
Other offshore bond providers, such as Royal Life and Royal Skandia, tend to
use third-party fund managers. The Isle of Man-based Royal Life, which has
more than Pounds 600m invested in single-premium bonds, offers a choice of
60 funds from investment houses that include Jardine Fleming, Barings,
Gartmore, Fidelity and GT.
As far as UK residents are concerned, Royal Life actuary Gary Boal comments:
'We would never promote offshore single-premium bonds on the grounds that
the tax breaks are better than those available with Tessas or personal
equity plans. But they do offer a compromise, because they provide exposure
to a mixture of cash, equity, bond and currency funds.'
According to Boal, the fastest area of growth for the life companies selling
offshore single-premium bonds is the expatriate market. 'Very often,' he
says, 'these people work in a tax-free environment and have accumulated a
sizeable chunk of capital. That is particularly true of the Far East. Hong
Kong is probably the biggest single market for these bonds.
'The appeal is that the lump-sum investments can be transferred from any
particular country in the world under the protective umbrella of the bond.
This is a great comfort factor to those investors who live in politically
sensitive regions.'
However, many of the bonds sold in the expatriate market are not, as is
common, based on the pooled investment fund principle, but rather used as a
shelter for an investor's own personal portfolio of shares.
Although most life companies allow free switching between in-house pooled
funds for lump-sum investments of Pounds 10,000 or more, there are
inevitably charges involved. But, says Boal: 'Royal Life, in common with
most of our competitors, has spread the up-front charges over a period of up
to five years, rather than deducting the full amount straight away.' In some
cases the initial charges can be as high as 7 per cent.
But, no matter how attractive the tax breaks may seem, the offshore
single-premium insurance bond is not a suitable investment vehicle for
everybody.
Andrew Jones, a director of the David Aaron Partnership, a firm of
independent financial advisers, argues:
'This is a specialised and sophisticated area of tax planning, and investors
must seek advice first. The tax breaks may be common to all of these bonds,
but it is just as important to pick the particular company with a range of
funds best suited to individual needs, and one which one has a consistent
performance track record. That said, those bonds which are based on pooled
investment funds can be just as effective for UK residents seeking to
mitigate income, capital gains and Inheritance Tax liabilities as they are
for expatriates.'
Finally, Jones also advises caution to UK residents tempted to use a
personalised bond, as opposed to one linked to a pooled fund. He points out:
'The Inland Revenue has laid down some very strict guidelines on their use.'
