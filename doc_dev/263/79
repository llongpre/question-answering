FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: IFG makes Pounds 2.25m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IFG Group, the Dublin-based financial services concern, is paying Pounds
2.25m to First National Leisure Services for the First National Trustee
Company, which provides trustee and administrative services to the leisure
industry from its base in the Isle of Man.
IFG, traded on the USM, reported pre-tax profits for the 1991 year down from
IPounds 1.6m to IPounds 1.09m (Pounds 997,000). Turnover was higher at
IPounds 4.85m (IPounds 3.33m).
The consideration will be satisfied by Pounds 1m cash and the issue of
redeemable preference shares in IFG Ventures, an Isle of Man offshoot. To
part fund the cash element 2m shares have been conditionally placed to raise
IPounds 440,000.
In addition IFG is issuing a warrant for 1.5m shares exercisable in five
years at 30p a share to FNLS.
The profit was struck after an exceptional charge of IPounds 237,000 and was
said to be satisfactory in the difficult market conditions. Earnings per
share were 3p (4.82p) and an increased single final dividend of 1.05p (1p)
is proposed.
