THE AWARD for Clerical Medical International is a recognition not only for
the company, but also for the Isle of Man, where it is based.
No company on the island has won an award before, even though its financial
services industry is almost wholly export-led. This may have been due to the
dubious reputation it had built up, mainly thanks to the collapse of the
Savings and Investment Bank in 1982.
Regulation has been much tightened since then, and the Isle of Man now has a
deposit protection scheme in place. It was also the first offshore
jurisdiction to win designated status under the UK's Financial Services Act
of 1988, which in effect recognised the island as offering the same degree
of investor protection as on the mainland.
The island's new clean-cut image has led to an influx of financial services
companies.
CMI, a subsidiary of Clerical Medical Investment, the Bristol-based life
assurance group, was established in March 1987, and has perhaps been the
most successful of the island's financial groups. It now has about 300
staff, including 170 based on the island, and sold a total of Pounds 149.5m
in new product business in 1991.
This accounted for 18 per cent of Clerical Medical's new premium income last
year, down slightly from 20 per cent the year before. CMI's total funds
under management are now around Pounds 450m.
Dr Bill Hastings, chief executive of the island's insurance regulatory
authority, is delighted by the news: 'What better accolade could our sector
have? This is a real first: a first for the island and a first for any life
insurance company. It is a winning day for the Isle of Man, and an event for
which the whole island may be proud.'
It is not surprising that life insurers have failed to win exports awards in
the past, as differing national tax regimes form a barrier against marketing
pensions or endowment savings plans in the same way in different countries.
Linguistic barriers are also a problem, given the personal contact from
salesmen which is usually necessary before consumers can be persuaded to buy
life insurance.
But these arguments do not apply to offshore life companies such as CMI.
Their tax position on the island is such that they would lose several
privileges if their products were available to Manx consumers.
Traditionally, the prime market for such companies has come from UK
expatriates - people working abroad who want a favourably-taxed resting
place for their savings. However, CMI and several other life groups have
broadened their sights in recent years to aim for 'international investors'.
For residents of any country, life funds held on the Isle of Man can roll up
gross of tax. Neither income nor capital gains tax is payable. For UK
citizens, tax will be only payable once these funds are brought back into
the UK by someone who has worked abroad - the tax-free roll-up ensures that
the tax bill will have been lessened.
This advantage also applies to foreigners working in the UK - 'inpats' in
the jargon. And several countries, such as Sweden, have tax regimes which
allow their citizens to shelter money offshore, even going to work abroad.
The recent decisions by both Hafnia of Denmark and Skandia of Sweden to set
up life operations on the island show the potential of this market.
CMI has been one of the most adroit in capturing the new market of 'high net
worth investors'. It now has representatives in more than 60 locations in
Europe, Asia and the US.
Although UK expatriates still make up the bulk of the business, about 25 per
cent comes from south-east Asia - a slightly smaller proportion than for
some Manx life companies, such as Royal International - while about 10 per
cent comes from Africa, and 10 per cent from South America, with around 4
per cent from Sweden, and 5 per cent from central Europe.
The company's product range has also helped it to attract more sophisticated
investors. Apart from the usual straightforward single premium life 'bonds',
and pension contracts, CMI has taken advantage of the opportunities Isle of
Man regulators have allowed for innovative fund management without a life
assurance element.
Thus there is a choice from straightforward deposit administration accounts
denominated in US dollars or Deutschmarks, through to 24 individual equity
funds investing in specific countries. CMI also offers umbrella funds, and
investments which 'track' the FT-All Share, S&amp;P 500 and Nikkei 225 indices.
There is also a range of trusts.
More product launches are planned for the near future. But for the time
being, the satisfaction of Mr Mike Richardson, CMI's chief executive, seems
justified: 'Today's announcement is a tribute to the hard work and
dedication of CMI's staff and to the support we have received since we
established operations on the Isle of Man.'
