SHOPRITE, the fast-expanding discount food retailer which operates mainly in
Scotland, lifted interim pre-tax profit by 62 per cent to Pounds 1.69m.
The company is based in the Isle of Man, where it has property interests,
supermarkets, and a car dealership, but discount food retailing has become
its principal activity.
Fourteen new stores were opened during the period, increasing the number in
Scotland to 47.
Group turnover for the half-year to May 2 increased 75 per cent to Pounds
66m.
Earnings per share jumped 50 per cent to 1.91p (1.27p) as did the interim
dividend, to 0.6p.
Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman, said that despite significantly increased
turnover, profits for the half were only slightly above those in the second
six months of last year partly due to the decision to lower prices and
margins.
Prices in the company's stores have fallen by an average of 8 per cent in
the last year.
Income from the Isle of Man property business also fell from Pounds 1.7m to
Pounds 600,000, following the sale of one of the company's office blocks.
The interest charge increased to Pounds 949,000 (Pounds 742,000) but gearing
fell from 66 per cent to 27 per cent after a share placing and open offer
raised Pounds 9.8m in February.
Analysts are forecasting Pounds 4.8m for the full year.
