Police are investigating allegations of corruption at Brent Council in
north-west London.
Three men were arrested in connection with the sale of former Brent Council
properties on March 17 by the public-sector corruption unit of the
Metropolitan Fraud Squad. The men were not charged but bailed to return in
three months.
Police would not name them but a spokesman for Brent's Labour group said
that they included Mr Ahmad Shahzad, a Labour councillor.
One of the main properties involved is Anson Hall in Willesden, Brent, which
is now owned by the Dar Al-Islam Foundation. This property was sold by the
council in early 1992 to Merpark, a company registered in the Isle of Man.
In September 1992 Merpark sold it to the Dar Al-Islam Foundation for Pounds
375,000.
Merpark began as a Manx shelf company in 1990 and was not activated until
sold to its present owners in 1991. Its shares are in the form of bearer
warrants. The company is owned by whoever holds the bearer warrant - a
system that provides anonymity.
Although the deeds of sale to the Dar Al-Islam Foundation were correctly
signed by one of Merpark's two Manx directors, the deeds of purchase by
Merpark from the council apparently were not. The only people authorised to
sign the deeds were any two of the company's two directors and the company
secretary at the time. Neither director saw or signed the purchase deeds.
