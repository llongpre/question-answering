FT  23 SEP 92 / People: Wading in to competition on ferry routes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of moves in the UK ferry industry will see Sea Containers' David
Benson, 48, promoted to the newly-created post of vice-president - Channel
and Solent ferry services in the run-up to the opening of the Channel
tunnel.
Benson (right), presently MD of Wightlink, Sea Containers' Isle of Wight
ferry operation, is a man worth watching. It was he who drew up Sea
Containers' headline-grabbing plans to bid for the franchise to run many of
British Rail's Network SouthEast commuter operations once the legislation
for rail privatisation has gone through.
Benson's previous incarnations include a 13-year stint at British Airways
and three years looking after the non-music activities of Richard Branson's
Virgin group. James Sherwood, Sea Containers' president, says he wants him
in this new post to strengthen management in the face of increasing
competition on the short sea routes to France.
Mike Aiken, the man who brought SeaCat to the Channel as vice president,
ferries and ports, remains in overall charge of Sea Containers' ferries
business. But Sherwood says the new appointment will free Aiken to spend
more time developing new SeaCat routes elsewhere in Europe and the rest of
the world.
Meanwhile, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has announced a successor to
Norman Corlett, the non-executive chairman who led the fight against the
recent hostile bid from Sea Containers. He is Juan Kelly (left), 61, who
recently retired as managing director of Shell International Marine.
A former president of the General Council of British Shipping and one of the
most distinguished figures in UK shipping, Kelly is joined by two other new
appointees: Brett Martin, who steps up from finance manager to finance
director, and Hamish Ross, md of Sea Containers Ferries Scotland, who joins
James Sherwood and Mike Aiken as non-executives by virtue of Sea Containers'
41 per cent shareholding in the company.
