FT  02 SEP 92 / Former Manx bank executive sentenced in land deals case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER senior executives of the Savings and Investment Bank, the Manx
bank which collapsed in 1982 owing Pounds 42m, were among five men who
appeared for sentencing yesterday for conspiracy to defraud shareholders and
creditors of a company in fraudulent land deals.
Mr Robert Killin, the former managing director of the SIB, was one of those
who benefited from one of the deals, Manchester Crown Court heard during a
nine-week trial.
The court was told that plots in Baxenden, Lancashire, and Rastrick, West
Yorkshire, were each bought for Pounds 80,000 by three of the men. But
Pennine Commercial Holdings paid Pounds 635,000 and Pounds 180,000 for them,
said Mr Roderick Carus, QC, prosecuting. Mr David Knott, Pennine's managing
director, directly benefited from the illicit profit of the Pounds 550,000
Baxenden deal, the court heard. So did Mr Killin, of Southport, and his
general manager Mr John Cunningham, of Newton Mearns, Glasgow.
In the Baxenden deal Mr Killin and Mr Cunningham set up a dummy company in
the Isle of Man and bought the land with the SIB's money. On the same day,
with the consent of other defendants, they arranged its sale to Pennine for
Pounds 85,000 cash and 5.5m 10p Pennine shares.
Mr Killin and Mr Cunningham sold their shares for more than Pounds 50,000.
Mr Carus said the Rastrick land was bought by Mr Geoffrey Tankard, a
Bradford solicitor of Ilkley, West Yorkshire. He was Pennine's chairman and
benefited from the inflated value when he sold it on to the company. He also
agreed to the other fraudulent deal, the court heard.
Mr Carus said that legal executive Mr Ronald Brockenbrow, who was the
secretary and a director of Pennine, of Chorlton, Manchester, knew of the
improper trading, while surveyor Mr Roderick Heaton, of Chelmsford, provided
a false valuation to justify the price Pennine paid for one plot.
Mr Carus said Pennine ceased trading after the bank's spectacular collapse
in 1982. The land deals were made in the previous two years.
Mr Knott admitted conspiracy in August 1989. He was jailed for six months
with the balance of a two-year term suspended. Judge Robert Hardy said
yesterday Mr Knott was 'the principal in this wholly unhappy affair'.
Mr Cunningham and Mr Tankard were given 12-month jail sentences and Mr
Brockenbrow and Mr Heaton six months, all fully suspended. Mr Killin will be
sentenced at a later date.
The judge said only Mr Tankard was in a position to meet a financial penalty
and although he had paid for his defence should contribute Pounds 5,000
towards the cost of the Crown.
The end of the trial means a Manx government probe into the bank's collapse
 -the Chadwick Report - can now be published.
Two years ago the Manx attorney-general and police were criticised for
failing to take appropriate action after the bank collapsed.
Mr Anthony May, QC, said in his report on the public inquiry into the Manx
government's conduct in the affair there was 'a lack of controlling strategy
by the attorney-general and a lack of action by the police'.
He said activity generated in June 1983 by the report from inspectors
appointed by the Manx High Court had petered out, with no decision either to
curtail or pursue police investigations.
Criminal proceedings against eight former directors, officials and agents of
the bank were not brought until March two years ago. The trial was abandoned
when the judge ruled that there had been unreasonable delay in bringing
charges, which had resulted in prejudice to the defendants.
The Manx government commissioned Mr May to conduct an inquiry to establish
whether steps taken after the bank's collapse were 'adequate and timely'.
