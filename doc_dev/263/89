FT  02 SEP 92 / Hopes raised for report on failed bank
</HEADLINE>

THERE were indications last night that an official report into the Pounds
42m collapse of an Isle of Man bank may soon be published.
They came after two former senior executives of Savings and Investment Bank
were among five men who appeared for sentencing at Manchester Crown Court
yesterday for conspiracy to defraud shareholders and creditors of a company
in fraudulent land deals.
About 4,000 investors lost money when the bank collapsed in 1982. But the
Chadwick Report into the collapse was not published because Mr Robert
Killin, the bank's managing director, and Mr John Cunningham, general
manager, faced criminal charges.
The two men were among five found guilty of fraud by a jury at Manchester
Crown Court. They used the bank's money in a Pounds 550,000 fraud over a
land deal in Lancashire.
Manx MPs later voted for 'modest' ex-gratia payments for investors but
shelved the decision until they had seen the Chadwick Report's conclusions.
Mr Fred Kissack, Manx government chief secretary, said last night the
decision on whether to allow publication rested with the island's High
Court, which commissioned the report and had been waiting for the mainland
trial to finish.
He said that on the assumption the court would allow publication, 'then we
will publish'.
The court was told that plots in Baxenden, Lancashire, and Rastrick, West
Yorkshire, were each bought for Pounds 80,000 by three of the men. But
Pennine Commercial Holdings paid Pounds 635,000 and Pounds 180,000 for them,
said Mr Roderick Carus QC, prosecuting.
Mr David Knott, Pennine's managing director, directly benefited from the
illicit profit of the Pounds 550,000 Baxenden deal, the court heard. So did
Mr Killin, of Southport, and Mr Cunningham, of Newton Mearns, Glasgow.
Mr Carus said the Rastrick land was bought by Mr Geoffrey Tankard, a
Bradford solicitor of Ilkley, West Yorkshire. He was Pennine's chairman and
benefited from the inflated value when he sold it on to the company. He also
agreed to the other fraudulent deal, the court heard.
Mr Carus said that legal executive Mr Ronald Brockenbrow, of Chorlton,
Manchester, who was the secretary and a director of Pennine, knew of the
improper trading, while surveyor Mr Roderick Heaton, of Chelmsford, provided
a false valuation to justify the price Pennine paid for one plot.
Mr Knott admitted conspiracy in August 1989. He was jailed for six months
with the balance of a two-year term suspended.
Mr Cunningham and Mr Tankard were given 12-month jail sentences and Mr
Brockenbrow and Mr Heaton six months, all fully suspended. Mr Killin will be
sentenced later date.
