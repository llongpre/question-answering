be struck off register after failing to file annual returns since 1990

HILLGATE, a company owned by Mr Asil Nadir and registered in the Isle of Man
since 1973, is due to be struck off the island's companies register next
month for not filing annual returns since 1990.
Under Manx company law, assets of companies struck off become the property
of the Manx treasury. Mr Nadir is listed as Hillgate's major shareholder.
Hillgate's assets include a Jersey-registered company, Restro, which was
used by Mr Nadir for his dealings in Polly Peck group shares. Both companies
are his personal companies and not part of Polly Peck.
Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'We
considered getting involved (with Hillgate) but on a risk-reward basis it
did not seem the right way to proceed.'
The Manx company was set up originally as part of a legal capital gains tax
avoidance scheme. Such schemes were popular at the time, particularly for
takeovers and flotations.
By exchanging UK company shares for shares in an offshore company in a
'paper-for-paper' transaction capital gains tax was avoided when the shares
were sold to the public.
Hillgate was first incorporated as Wearwell Holdings and changed its name in
1980. In December 1990 three Manx nominee directors resigned and since then
the company has been without directors and has filed no annual returns.
In addition to Mr Nadir's shareholding of 800 B shares there is a block of
97 A shares held by a nominee company. It has not been possible to identify
the beneficial owner of these shares.
Polly Peck also placed its group of five Voyager companies in the Isle of
Man, which are the subject of litigation in the Manx courts.
Polly Peck administrators are trying to reclaim shares in Voyager believed
to be worth about Pounds 8m that were transferred to Mr Nadir a few days
before the administrators were appointed.
They claim the share transfer was not valid as they alleged the resolution
ordering it was made at an illegally-constituted meeting in northern Cyprus.
The case is due to be heard on July 6 in an Isle of Man court.
Meanwhile, Mr Christopher Morris, administrator to Polly Peck at Touche
Ross, said yesterday that he had been in correspondence with the
Conservative party concerning Mr Nadir's political donations.
He said he would seek advice on the issue soon from the company's creditors'
committee.
