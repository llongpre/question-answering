Kwik Save is consolidating its position as Britain's leading discount grocer
by purchasing 117 of Shoprite group's stores in Scotland and northern
England for Pounds 45.4m in cash.
Under the terms of the deal Kwik Save - which yesterday announced a 7.5 per
cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 135.6m - will acquire
assets with a book value in October 1993 of Pounds 59.6m.
The deal signals the end of the rapid rise and fall of Shoprite in mainland
Britain, after it expanded away from its roots as a supermarket, property
and motor retailing group in the Isle of Man in 1990. It is a blow to Mr
Deryck Nicholson, Shoprite's chairman, who, ironically, is the son of one of
Kwik Save's co-founders.
The acquisition would give Kwik Save almost 10 per cent of the Scottish
grocery market - which it has been trying to break into for 18 months, but
where it has only six stores after experiencing difficulties finding sites.
Mr Graeme Bowler, Kwik Save's chief executive, acknowledged the acquisition
might cause 'some short-term pain' - it will dilute earnings slightly this
year - but believed sales could quickly be boosted by converting Shoprite
stores into Kwik Saves.
Shoprite is the first failure among the discount chains that have expanded
rapidly in the UK during in the 1990s. Its shares were best performers in
the food retailing sector last year, peaking at 241p last February. They
fell 1p to 21p yesterday. Kwik Save shares gained 15p at 551p.
Shoprite has issued two profits warnings in four months and has been working
closely with its bankers since July. Analysts believe it expanded too
quickly, paying too much for sometimes substandard sites.
Mr Charles Good, managing director of Scottish operations, denied the deal
was a distress sale, but acknowledged that with no sign of improvement in
the market 'to try and soldier on would have been catastrophic'.
Shoprite's directors warned that if the disposal is not completed, 'the
group is unlikely to be able to trade out of its financial difficulties'.
Shoprite proposes to use the deal's proceeds to repay borrowings, and
refocus on its remaining eight supermarkets and other operations in the Isle
of Man.
