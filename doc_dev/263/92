'stream' of complaints

THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday revoked the consumer credit licences of
six companies associated with Club Riviera, one of the UK's leading
timeshare groups.
This is the first time the OFT has taken such action against a timeshare
company.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said: 'We have received and
continue to receive a stream of complaints against some of these companies
which suggest that their conduct has been seriously misleading and
deceptive.'
He added that the complaints included 'allegations that the companies have
induced customers to purchase timeshare accommodation by making false or
misleading statements'.
Club Riviera and the other five companies were told three weeks ago they
might lose their licences and were invited to make their case. Sir Bryan
said no representations had been made.
Three of the companies, Club Riviera (UK), Club Tenerife Sales and Regency
Palms Sales, are subsidiaries of the Manchester-based Riviera group. The
companies specialise in selling timeshare properties in Spain and the Canary
Islands.
The Riviera group has management contracts with the three other companies
involved in the OFT decision - Ryefix, Canary Islands Holiday Club and
Marbella Beach Club - which are registered in the Isle of Man.
The effect of the OFT move is to bar the companies from either offering
credit themselves (to finance sales) or acting as a broker for other
companies to do so.
Last September, Club Riviera was convicted by Staffordshire magistrates on
charges of making false advertising statements.
Mr Simon Clarke, director of Club Riviera, said yesterday that his company
had no intention of appealing against the OFT's verdict.
'The action of the OFT today is solely aimed at preventing finance to
purchasers,' he said. 'We don't provide finance, we haven't for a long time
and we have no intention of providing finance in the future. For those
reasons we have decided not to make representations.'
He added that 'in no way whatsoever' would it affect his business; he
expected to gain about 6,000 more timeshare customers this year.
Mr Clarke rejected the idea that the OFT ruling cast a stigma over both his
business and the timeshare industry generally.
He said: 'We don't see it like that. Being in the timeshare industry alone
is as bad as you can get as far as company credibility can go. In terms of
public awareness, you don't have good timeshares and bad timeshares, you
just have timeshares.'
Later this year the Timeshare Act is due to come into force in the UK. It
will provide a mandatory 14-day 'cooling-off' period before the final
completion of timeshare purchases.
The European Commission is also considering a directive on regulation of
timeshare.
The group has the right to appeal to the trade and industry secretary within
28 days, or the OFT's judgment will stand.
