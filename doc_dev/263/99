   Black Monday was more like Bullion Monday for the coin market, which had a potentially disappointing year rescued by the stock crash. 

   After a mostly lackluster nine months, sales of gold, silver and other coins exploded. 
Leading the way were the American Eagle and Canadian Maple Leaf gold coins, which helped gold bullion coin sales increase 400% world-wide during the two weeks after Oct. 19 compared with the previous fortnight, according to industry estimates. 

   Even one of the coin market's more esoteric items, the Isle of Man's one-ounce Noble platinum coin, registered a 200% sales rise after the crash, in response to a fall in platinum prices. 

   In the chaos, many wanted an investment they could hold in their hands. 
"The casual investor didn't understand what was happening (after the crash), but all he wanted was quality," said John M. Fraser Jr., senior vice president at Bank of Boston Corp.'s Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, which sells much of the industrial gold used in the U.S. 

   The crash stimulated sales, after a relatively slow summer, of the U.S. mint's American Eagle gold coin, which now has from 55% to 65% of a U.S. market that a few years ago was dominated by Canada and South Africa. 
The mint says of the 2.9 million ounces of gold it has sold since the coin was introduced in October 1986, almost 200,000 ounces, or 8%, were sold during the October crash month. 

   Some analysts say the real story of 1987 was the U.S. mint's continued success marketing coins, silver as well as gold. 
The mint has sold almost 14 million ounces of the American Eagle silver coin since the October 1986 introduction --more than triple its original sales projection of four million. 

   "I think it's astonishing that you can have a new product and suddenly sell 13 million units," said David L. Ganz, a New York lawyer and author specializing in numismatics. 

   The October demand for coins, which has since leveled off, was all the more noteworthy because precious metals prices in general didn't rise immediately after the crash as experts assumed they would. 
"I was stunned," said Bruce L. Kaplan, senior vice president of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., a large Beverly Hills, Calif., dealer. 

   "What we didn't realize was the dramatic crash forced many, many precious metals investors to liquidate their 'disaster insurance,' their 'disaster money,' to pay for (stockbroker) margin calls," Mr. Kaplan explained. 
That phenomenon, he adds, was one that "people like me missed. 
We'd never experienced a crash." 

   Meanwhile, the U.S. mint's heavy advertising of its coins promises to entice new investors --only 8% of Americans have ever owned gold in any form --and broaden the entire metals market, Mr. Ganz said. 
"Any way you put it, it's the government giving its imprimatur to precious metals," he said. 
Other countries' mints will be seeking to take advantage of the new American appetite. 
Predicted Mr. Ganz: "I think you're going to see a wealth of new products (in 1988)."
