<LEADPARA>  The handwritten manuscript for half of Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn," one of the touchstones of the American imagination, has been discovered
in a Los Angeles attic after being lost for more than a century.;    The 665
pages, heavily annotated in pen and ink, make up the first half of the novel,
according to Sotheby's, the auction house, which announced the discovery
Wednesday. The manuscript for the second half has been at the Buffalo and Erie
County, N.Y., Public Library since the 1880s.  </LEADPARA>

HALF OF TWAIN'S TEXT OF CLASSIC WAS IN ATTIC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I'm stupefied," said Kenneth Sanderson, an editor of the Mark Twain
Project at the University of California, Berkeley, which is publishing
scholarly editions of all of Twain's work. " 'Huckleberry Finn' is the nearest
thing we have to the Great American Novel in this country. We had all given up
on the manuscript long ago. Even the author thought it had been destroyed.";  
 "This is the most amazing survival imaginable so far as American literature
is concerned," said Paul Needham, who heads Sotheby's books and manuscripts
department in New York. "The only thing comparable to it I can think of would
be an original Shakespeare manuscript.";    Perhaps the most American of
books, "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" was first published in England in
1884. Not until the next year did it appear in the United States, where the
first critical reactions ranged from silence to abject derision.;   
Eventually, mining many of the classic themes of American literature and life,
the book hit its mark. The story of a rebellious boy's coming of age on a
Mississippi River raft trip, it presaged such hallmarks of American fiction as
J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield in "Catcher in the Rye" and Saul Bellow's
Augie March in "The Adventures of Augie March.";    But the novel was far more
than an epic about a boy growing up in a violent society. It also was about
the American frontier and the nation's tortured relationship with religion. In
its painful look at the treatment of Huck's raft companion, a slave named Jim,
it provides one of the most telling accounts of American race relations ever
published.;    Twain, a pen name for Samuel Langhorne Clemens, started the
book in 1876 but put it away after a couple of years because, as he wrote at
the time, "the well ran dry." Because he stopped and started it many times
over the years, this heavily rewritten manuscript has special significance for
scholars.;    Written neatly on small lined note paper, the document appears
to vary widely from the original published text, according to Sotheby's
officials, and includes at least one large section never published in the
first edition.;    The manuscript is of particular interest because the story
is written in dialect, making it likelier that printers of the time would
introduce spelling and punctuation errors.;    Twain was infuriated because
printers commonly made changes. On one occasion, he said his publisher had
written "that the printer's proofreader was improving my punctuation for me,
and I telegraphed orders to have him shot without giving him time to pray.";  
 The second half of the manuscript has been in Buffalo since Twain sent it
there at the request of James Fraser Gluck, a lawyer and local civic leader.
Gluck had asked for the original manuscript of Twain's "Life on the
Mississippi," but since that was unavailable, Twain sent Huckleberry Finn.;   
Gluck's granddaughter found the manuscript in an old trunk last fall and later
sent it to Sotheby's for authentication. Officials there said Wednesday that
it almost certainly would be sent to Buffalo.;    "Persons attempting to find
a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted," Twain wrote in what has become
perhaps the most famous prefatory note in American literature. "Persons
attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find
a plot will be shot."  </TEXT>
