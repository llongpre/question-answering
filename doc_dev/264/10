   One hundred years after Mark Twain published
``A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,'' the author's voice
sounds as fresh as when Twain wrote the novel, a literary scholar
says.
   ``He anticipated so much how we talk now that we're right at
home,'' said Victor Fischer, associate editor of the Mark Twain
Project at the University of California at Berkeley's Bancroft
Library. ``When you find the familiar things from his sayings and
his expressions that have entered into the language, you realize
how much he's pervaded the way we talk.''
   About 150 scholars and Twain experts from around the world meet
today through Saturday at Elmira College to mark the centennial of
the publication of ``A Connecticut Yankee'' and to celebrate one of
America's most enduring writers.
   Twain wrote some of ``A Connecticut Yankee'' in Elmira and is
buried a little more than a mile away from the Elmira College
campus.
   ``Mark Twain is our most definitively American writer,'' said
Darryl Baskin, director of the Elmira College Center for Mark Twain
Studies. ``He wrote the way Americans spoke ... and he was very
much alive to the emergence of popular culture. He connected this
with literature.''
   Marianne Curling, curator of the Mark Twain Memorial in
Hartford, Conn., said that while ``A Connecticut Yankee'' is not
Twain's most popular or successful work, it remains relevant today.
   ``It talks about the impact of technology in society,'' she
said. ``There were a lot of new and different things going on then,
the scariest of which was electricity. People either thought
electricity would cure the ills of society or destroy it. It's very
much like people regard nuclear power today.''
   The book tells about a journey back in time of Hank Morgan, a
Connecticut factory mechanic, to the 6th century England of King
Arthur.
   Twain, an avid reader of history, originally envisioned the book
as a sort of burlesque about the customs of the time, such as the
problem a knight in armor might have encountered when he had to
scratch or blow his nose.
   But as his writing progressed, it took on a much darker tone.
Twain's Yankee used his knowledge of modern technology to seize
control of the court and to begin imposing his own customs on the
land. The novel ends with an Armageddonlike battle where an army of
some 10,000 knights is slaughtered by electrocution, Gatling guns
and drowning.
   Twain himself admitted that the book ``slumped into funereal
seriousness'' in its latter stages.
   Everett Emerson, a Twain biographer, says a series of personal
setbacks, including the souring of many of the author's
investments, largely accounts for the ominous tone of the final
two-thirds of the novel.
   Fischer said the reasons for the book's change of gears remains
a source of controversy among literary critics a century later. So
too, he said, is the message that Twain aimed to convey.
   ``The dispute tends to be over whether he was extolling the 19th
century in contrast with the ignorance and cruelty of ancient times
or whether, in fact, he was saying, `A plague on both your
houses,''' Fischer said. ``There is something of both in the book.''
   Whatever the intent, the subject matter is a far cry from what
Twain had given readers previously in such books as ``Roughing
It,'' ``Innocents Abroad'' and especially ``The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer'' and ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' There Twain had
combined humor with an often sharp satirical eye aimed at
puncturing the pomposities and superstitions of the age.
   Twain had regarded ``A Connecticut Yankee'' as ``uncommonly
bully'' and predicted it would sell 100,000 copies in its first
year. But the book merely continued his financial headaches: it
sold 34,000 copies that first year amid mixed reviews and Twain's
own publishing company was in such bad financial condition that the
author received no money for it at all.
