Actor William Windom strolls into the room sporting an Irish blackthorn walking 
stick, a subtle touch that lends a theatrical flair to his entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Windom, the curmudgeonly grandfather in NBC's "Parenthood," is adept at 
gestures that get him noticed in supporting roles. Until this season he played 
Dr. Seth Hazlitt on CBS' "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
He describes his "Parenthood character, Frank Buckman, as "kind of a pain in 
the butt," adding, "So am I." 
</P>
<P>
"Frank's resigned to being the elder statesman of the family," Windom said. 
"He's old Mr. Reliable without a lot of laughs. He doesn't expect a lot of 
people, and he's seldom disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Windom's character has a touchy relationship with one of his sons, played by Ed 
Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bit of warfare there," he said. "If you can combine it with a hug 
now and then, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
Windom takes over the "Parenthood" role played in the hit movie by a longtime 
associate and former nextdoor neighbor, Jason Robards. 
</P>
<P>
"He was Doc Holliday in 'Hour of the Gun,' and I was one of the henchmen," 
Windom recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Windom, who had spent 15 years on Broadway appearing in 24 plays, got one of 
his biggest acting challenges in his 1962 film debut. He shared courtroom 
scenes with Gregory Peck in the Academy Award-winning "To Kill a Mockingbird." 
</P>
<P>
"I was the district attorney, and he was the defense attorney," he said. "I 
didn't have many lines. I had to keep making up all kinds of business. I'd have 
my tie on funny, chew on a pencil, throw my leg over a chair." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Windom moved to Los Angeles to concentrate on movies and 
television. In his first TV series, "The Farmers's Daughter," he was the 
congressman and romantic interest for Inger Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
In his second, "My World and Welcome To It," he won a 1970 Emmy as best actor 
in a comedy series -- after the show had been canceled. His role was loosely 
based on the works of writer-cartoonist James Thurber. Since 1972, the actor 
has done four one-man shows on Thurber material; he is currently at the 
Westwood Playhouse Tuesday-Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
He also has added World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle to his repertoire. He 
will perform "Ernie Pyle" Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. at Pasadena's Ambassador 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking around for another one-man show," said Windom, who was with the 
82nd Airborne in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. "I didn't want to do 
George Washington or Mark Twain. I thought of something from World War II. I 
was going to do fiction, until I discovered Pyle. I also found some of his 
civilian writing. He was a very sensitive human being, like Thurber. 
</P>
<P>
"I still do (the Pyle show) on weekends. It keeps the stage in me alive. The 
stage makes me more confident to do movies and television. And movies and 
television help you sell more tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Windom recently was in St. Joseph, Mo., to film "Back To Hannibal: The Return 
of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn," now airing on the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, now grown up, return to defend 
their friend Jim on a murder charge. Windom plays Judge Thatcher, Becky 
Thatcher's father. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't film in Hannibal because the city's too built up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Windom began acting in military school at the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the ingenue (in one of the school's plays) since it was an all-boys 
school," he said. "My mother came backstage afterward, and she hadn't realized 
I was actually in it. I held up the brassiere under her nose. She said, 'You 
know, I looked at that girl."' 
</P>
<P>
The actor mused that he didn't learn of his most notable academic achievement 
until 10 years ago, during a lunch with actress Margaret Hamilton, who played 
the villain in "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
"She said something about Rye, New York, and I said I had gone to kindergarten 
at the Rye Country Day School," Windom recalled. "She said she had taught 
there. We compared notes and it turned out I had been in her class. I started 
my education under the Wicked Witch of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 "Parenthood" airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. on NBC. "Back to Hannibal: The Return of 
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn" airs Thursday at 8 p.m. and 1 a.. early Friday 
on the Disney Channel. 
</P>
