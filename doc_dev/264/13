<LEADPARA>  WHAT DO J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye," Paul Zindel's "My Darling,
My Hamburger," Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," John Howard
Griffin's "Black Like Me," and "The Diary of Anne Frank" have in common?;  
The answer: These five books, long recognized as classics, are among the
titles most often banned by school boards and libraries throughout the United
States.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The inglorious five are joined by other books. Among them are George
Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and "Animal Farm," which dare suggest that
human freedom matters more than the bloody functioning of the state, and
Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird," a powerful critique of racism. Like
"Huckleberry Finn" and Claude Brown's memoir of growing up in Harlem,
"Manchild in the Promised Land," Lee's novel makes use of the word "nigger" --
reason enough, the censors argue, to lock all three books away.;   Add to them
Kurt Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse-Five," depicting a World War II in which the
Nazis aren't the only ones to commit atrocities; John Knowles' "A Separate
Peace," in which a young man grappling to understand his emergent sexuality
ponders whether his attraction is to men and not women; D.H. Lawrence's "Lady
Chatterley's Lover," once banned by the U.S. post office; and Pearl Buck's
"The Good Earth," suspected since well before the Cold War of beaming
premature anti-fascist thoughts into the minds of young America. Classics all,
and dangerous to the touch.;   Schools and libraries aren't the only
battlegrounds. The recent flap over Brett Easton Ellis' "American Psycho" -- a
pre-eminently trashy book, to be sure, that advances the notion that
programmatic violence against women is an acceptable alternative lifestyle --
indicates that the war against free expression has been taken into the
marketplace. Not content to address Ellis' book alone, a liberal coalition
urged a boycott of all books published by Vintage, the house that brought out
"American Psycho.";   Booksellers, having recently weathered the war against
poor Salman Rushdie, have been targeted as well.;   The First Amendment has
had its share of enemies ever since the Founding Fathers (or should that be
the Founding Primary Caregivers?) set quill to paper, from embittered closet
royalists on down the line to the Rev. Donald Wildmon. In the past, those foes
of free speech have been more or less ignored, and the life of the mind has
gone on. Times are changing, though, in this kinder, gentler America.;   In
the wake of the Robert Mapplethorpe controversy, the aptly named Thomas
Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression conducted a nationwide
survey with results that should alarm any writer, publisher, bookseller,
citizen. In it, 25 percent of the 1,500 adults polled agreed that the First
Amendment should protect their speech, but not the expressions of others,
especially in the arts or media. A full 60 percent maintained that the
government should enjoy the power to censor works of art. Jesse Helms must be
in hog heaven.;   Our embattled literature and the First Amendment that, at
least for now, protects it, deserve celebration. Sept. 28-Oct. 5 is Banned
Books Week, an annual observance sponsored by the American Library
Association. It affords concerned citizens a chance to do something
substantial: to support librarians who dare defy so-called community standards
by allowing open access to such books as Maya Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged
Bird Sings," to demand that elected officials stand by the Constitution they
have sworn to uphold.;   Now there would be just cause to rally 'round the
flag. For once, only tyrants would lose.  </TEXT>
