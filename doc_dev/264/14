California Senate Bill 813, enacted in 1983, asks that the content of 
secondary-school courses stimulate an improvement in the effort and performance 
of students nationwide. Thus spurred, the State Board of Education adopted 
school curriculums (developed by the superintendent of public instruction) with 
literary works of "compelling, intellectual, social or moral content," whose 
example by way of excellent use of language would encourage writing and 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Individual choices are made by Orange County school district committees, taking 
into account the perceived needs and abilities of their students. The Santa Ana 
Unified School District has a short core list of requirements for teachers to 
choose from (for example, one epic or one play among two or three). Extended 
readings are made at teachers' discretion: English is a second language for a 
large percentage of students. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Union High School District, at the other end of the 
spectrum, offers four tracks from grades 10 to 12: Honors, College Prep, 
Readings List and Fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
In the Capistrano Unified School District, junior and senior years don't share 
a central curriculum: Students may choose from a variety of electives to 
fulfill the necessary credits. The lists below only include English, American 
and world literature classes; other elective classes offer such topics as sea 
literature, sports literature and science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The lists compiled here began as lists of novels. However, because plays are 
not distinguished from novels within the core list in the Santa Ana and 
Capistrano school districts, drama has been added into other school district 
lists for the sake of consistency.
