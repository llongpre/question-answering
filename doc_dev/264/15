Video has finally come to the classroom, and many cable television networks 
have responded by contributing commercial-free blocks of programming designed 
for teachers (or education-minded parents) to tape and use as teaching aides. 
You can set your VCR for Kids World (weekdays at 6:30 a.m. on Nickelodeon), a 
syndicated news and documentary program created by and for kids. For 8- to 
15-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Also airing without commercials are Eureeka's Castle (weekends at 7 a.m. on 
Nickelodeon), which uses puppetry and animation to teach gentle lessons about 
socializing. For 2- to 6-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
On Kids Court (7:30 a.m. weekends on Nickelodeon), kids can air their 
grievances in a courtroom setting. Each of the programs will be preceded by a 
two- to three-minute "teacher guide," offering tips for teachers using the 
shows. For 8- to 15-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Every weekday at 6 a.m., the Discovery Channel airs two commercial-free 20-25 
minute program segments under the umbrella title Assignment: Discovery. Shows 
presented fall under daily themes: Monday shows explore science and technology, 
Tuesday social studies, Wednesday natural science, Thursday arts and humanities 
and Friday world events and contemporary issues. A "video bulletin board" 
following the daily segments offers listings of news and events of interest to 
teachers. For secondary school students and some primary school students.
