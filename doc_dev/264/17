   Every year scores of books are banned in schools
and libraries across America, usually at the behest of parents who
find their contents offensive. Here's a look at some of the works
that have been censored and the efforts by some writers and
librarians to fight back.

   This week more than 40 million public school children and 13
million college students begin returning to their classrooms. But in
many of these halls of learning, the shadow of censorship hangs over
that source of light and knowledge, the library.
   Freedom of speech and the press, to write and to read whatever
you like, remains protected in America. But those freedoms are
frequently challenged. Public and school librarians often feel under
siege.
   Books as seemingly harmless as Mark Twain's ``Huckleberry Finn''
and L. Frank Baum's ``The Wizard of Oz'' have been challenged. Some
of the most-frequent targets are John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and
Men,'' Kurt Vonnegut's ``Slaughterhouse Five'' and J.D. Salinger's
``Catcher in the Rye.''
   But, as the school board in Eliot, Maine, said in rejecting a
parental request to ban Judy Blume's novel ``Forever'' as
pornographic: ``... while you have the right to censor material for
your child, we do not believe you have that right for other children
in the system.''
   It's estimated that since Johann Gutenberg invented the printing
press five centuries ago, some 25 million individual books have been
written and published, almost a third in the English language.
Worldwide, an additional 350,000 titles are published every year, at
least 50,000 in the United States.
   To house and protect this multiplicity of ideas, the United
States supports more than 115,000 libraries of all kinds.
   Judith Krug, who writes and edits the American Library
Association's Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom, chronicles those
individuals and groups ``who attempt to remove those materials from
public availability and accessibility.''
   ``This is a constitutional republic, but the constitutional
republic does not work unless the electorate is enlightened,'' she
said. ``We are a nation of self-governors, but in order to make
appropriate decisions we need to have information available and
accessible.''
   In three weeks, authors and celebrities will visit bookstores and
libraries across the country to read publicly excerpts from banned
books as they did when Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses''
raised such a furor.
   In Los Angeles, for instance, PEN Center West, an author's group,
will meet in Malibu for readings of banned books. Among the invited
are Steve Allen, Alice Walker, Martin Sheen, Ray Bradbury, Hope
Lange, Alvin Toffler, Larry King and Billy Crystal.
   In the 1986-87 academic year, People for the American Way
reported 153 attempts to remove books from public schools or
libraries in 41 states, 37 percent of them successful.
   In the year ended May 1989, the American Library Association
reported that more than 100 books were brought up on charges,
including Jim Davis' ``Garfield: His Nine Lives.''
   That cartoon book was challenged in Saginaw, Mich., by a parent
who found some of the language and drawings offensive.
   Said Stephen James, assistant director for the Saginaw County
Public Library, ``It was intended to be a children's book. But some
of the language was challenging.''
   A parent objected to one illustration Davis had captioned, ``She
stormed, she fumed, she kicked ass.'' The drawing depicts a woman,
kicking a man and sending him tumbling.
   The library review committee decided to keep the book, but in the
adult section.
   It has been a rough time for James and the Saginaw libraries.
They received 11 challenges from May to December 1988.
   The Saginaw authorities reported to the library association,
``Although no evidence of an organized censorship effort has been
found as yet ... the sheer number of challenges placed a clear
burden on the library and to many seemed to suggest further
trouble.''
   The first was Larry King's ``Tell It to the King.'' The
complainant resented what she felt was foul language and called it
``an insult to one's intelligence.'' Said James, ``We decided to
keep it on the shelves. Our librarians felt the quotes were
well-handled.''
   Among those that followed were Alice Walker's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, ``The Color Purple,'' and another children's
book, ``Katie Morag and the Tiresome Ted'' by Mairi Hedderwick, the
story of a child's jealousy when a new baby arrives. Why? The
mother's breast is exposed as she holds a smiling baby, but the baby
is not suckling. The complaint asked that the illustration be
covered.
   The woman who complained about ``Sir Gawain and the Loathly
Lady,'' by Selina Hasting, found the book charming but asked the
library to ``white out'' a sentence that contained profanity.
   The library's review committee could not find anything
pornographic in ``Public Smiles, Private Tears,'' by Helen Van
Slyke, or anything objectionable in ``King Stork'' by Howard Pyle.
The review committee said:
   ``Howard Pyle is a classic children's author who was very much
respected in his time. His text reflects values and practices we now
find repugnant in the same way that other classic books
(`Huckleberry Finn,' `Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' `Dr. Doolittle,'
`Little House on the Prairie,' etc.) contain racist and sexist
attitudes or words that belong to a bygone age. Mr. Pyle is true to
the spirit of folklore in his original folktale.''
   Saginaw received a complaint because the Bible and books on
Christianity were shelved with books on myths and other religions,
but that is where the Dewey Decimal System places them.
   What about a picture book for children, named ``Where's Waldo?'',
in which young readers scan through a busy page of a hundred or so
small illustrations of tiny characters to find Waldo? He is either
lost in the illustrations of people doing things at a track meet or
a department store. But among the illustrations, one woman found a
little boy, peeking under a curtain at a woman in a department store
dressing room. As in the other cases, the review committee refused
to ban the book.
