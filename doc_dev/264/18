   So many books in the world. So what shall we read?
   Three British bookmen and 15 collaborators have produced a list
of 2,500 books they consider are the best in the English language.
   ``That's a lot of titles, but if you start young enough, we
think you could get through it. You could read a book a week if you
wanted to,'' said Brian Last, one of the three editors of ``An
English Library'' from Gower Publishing Co.
   Their book contains 15 categories of books, from fiction to
reference, and cites 11 books of the Bible in the Old Testament and
seven in the New Testament.
   Charles Dickens' novels and William Shakespeare's plays mingle
with the poems of the present poet laureate of England, Ted Hughes,
and modern American novels such as Ken Kesey's ``One Flew over the
Cuckoo's Nest.''
   The new book is based on ``An English Library'' by the late
Frank Seymour Smith, a librarian whose choice ran to more than
5,000 books in 1963, none of them by a living author.
   ``Our changes take account of more modern tastes,'' said Last in
an interview. ``We wanted to remodel Smith, put in contemporary
writers and add new sections like world literature in English which
takes account of important authors in Australia, Canada, India and
Africa.''
   Last, 39, is managing editor of Scholar Press, a Gower
subsidiary. He and co-editors Nigel Farrow, 50, chairman of Gower,
and Vernon Pratt, a researcher at Lancaster University who is in
his 40s, say they compiled their list with the single aim of
extending people's enjoyment of reading.
   ``We all write, teach or publish books for a living but read
them for enjoyment,'' Farrow said.
   ``At the end of the day there is always the worry that we might
have left out something important but we have done as much
painstaking research as we could,'' Last said. ``We tried to
include everything that is first rate of its kind.''
   Smith put asterisks against his personal choices in what he
called the ``exhilarating wealth of genius in English books.''
   The editors of the new edition have not done the same but at the
request of The Associated Press, Last and Farrow (Pratt was
unavailable) selected their top books in each category. Here they
are, with the original publication dates:

   ``There was some argument over the American novel, and `Gatsby'
was challenged by `Huckleberry Finn' (Mark Twain),'' said Last.
   ``There was a problem with the poetry as we felt that (Geoffrey)
Chaucer, (Philip) Larkin, (Thomas) Hardy and (Andrew) Marvell had a
right to the top spot but we agreed that Yeats had the edge.
   ``It was enormously difficult to choose a play of Shakespeare as
all his plays should really be there, and on another day we might
have picked `Othello.'''
   The editors' final advice: ``If you don't like something, don't
plow through it. Reading isn't competition, it's enjoyment. The
classic you don't like is in our book because it is a classic.''
   ``An English Library'' costs $25.50. It is available in the
United States from Barbara Church at Gower Publishing, Old Post
Road, Brookfield, Vt. 05036.
