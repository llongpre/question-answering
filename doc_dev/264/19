   Three retirees who set out on the Huck
Finn adventure they missed in their youth got a little more than
they bargained for on a nine-day trip. They found out why it's
called the mighty Mississippi.
   ``It's not a trip for the faint of heart,'' said Irving Glazer,
70, who took on 900 miles of the Mississippi River with Alvin
Levenson, 67, and Stanley Herman, 66, all of Indianapolis.
   The three set out from Cairo, Ill., aboard not a raft but a
24-foot pontoon boat, The Silver Fox. They ended up at Baton Rouge,
La., weary from struggling against currents, sandbars and the giant
workboats that ply the river.
   They had intended to continue on to New Orleans but took a look
at the seagoing vessels docked at Baton Rouge and decided to finish
the trip by car.
   In Mark Twain's 1884 novel, Huckleberry Finn and Jim jump off
their raft just before it is run over by a paddlewheel steamer. The
only steamboats the Indianapolis three saw were of the tourist
variety, but they got their fill of barges.
   Mississippi barges carry up to 1,500 tons each, and the lower
river is their workyard. That, with the logs and other debris in
the water, made for tough maneuvering for the modern-day Huck Finns.
   ``It was like riding a bicycle on an interstate,'' Levenson said.
   The trip got off to a rough, wet start when the Fox left Cairo,
at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, on May 2,
fighting heavy head winds and pounding waves.
   ``None of us dreamed we would hit four-foot waves on a river,
but we did,'' Levenson said.
   The second day out, the travelers ran into a sandbar between
Hickman, Ky., and Memphis and radioed the Coast Guard for help. A
rescue squad from Reelfoot Lake, Tenn., freed the boat and cleaned
the sand out of its 60-horsepower outboard.
   ``They said they really appreciated us calling them because it
was the first rescue they'd had this year,'' said Levenson.
   The Indianapolis three were retired businessmen expecting a
leisurely trip. But they got little use out of the lawn chairs and
battery-operated TV they had packed. The river current changed
often and the water was full of debris.
   ``We had to keep a spotter up front the whole trip,'' Levenson
said.
   The three spent four nights on the boat but found overnight
accommodations ashore the rest of the time.
   Unlike Huck Finn, they never stumbled into a bloody feud between
two families and never got mixed up in a con game. No one nearly
drowned. Still, they found some of the same scenery Twain described
in the 19th century.
   Levenson said it was lonely amid the thick woods lining the
riverbanks.
   ``There wasn't a living soul for miles. There is nothing along
that bank, no telephone poles or any sign of life,'' Levenson said.
``When we got to Memphis there were a few pleasure boats. Outside
of that, there wasn't another pleasure boat on the whole trip.''
   Below Memphis, the travelers hung up on another sandbar and this
time no help was around.
   ``We took off our clothes and got into the water. There we were,
three old guys in the Mississippi River pushing and pushing until
we got back into the deep water,'' Levenson said.
   While the trip was rougher than expected, Glazer said he's ready
to do it again.
   ``It's the most exciting thing I think I've ever done,'' he
said. ``It was a challenge and there was an element of danger.''
