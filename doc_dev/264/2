   A black parent who complained that two
classics by Mark Train were racially offensive said he was
disappointed that school board members decided Wednesday to keep
the books as required reading.
   ``There should have been more consideration given to the problem
than take it back to square one,'' David Perry said.
   Perry said he was pleased with the public review of ``The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and ``The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn.''
   ``I think the process was a good one for the community because I
think there was a dialogue ... that was very, very needed,'' he
said.
   Perry said he had high regard for 500 high school students who
circulated a petition to retain ``Huckleberry Finn,'' saying they
got a chance to hear the black perspective on the book.
   School board members capped a five-hour meeting by voting
unanimously to keep the books on the required reading list.
   Perry received a standing ovation when he accused the books of
portraying blacks in a racist, degrading manner.
   ``No matter what the depiction of time, I think any writer and
any orator who has to use the word `nigger' more than 300 times in
a presentation leaves something to be desired,'' Perry said.
   The hearing stemmed from Perry's complaint about his daughter's
discomfort while reading ``Tom Sawyer.'' At his urging, the school
board's Materials Review Committee agreed to take the books off the
required list and make them optional reading.
   Both books were written by Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who used
the pen name Mark Twain. ``Tom Sawyer,'' written in 1876, is drawn
from Twain's boyhood in Hannibal, Mo. ``Huckleberry Finn'' was
published in England in 1884 and in the United States in 1885.
   Plano students first meet Tom in the seventh grade and read
about Huck's adventures in the 11th grade.
   Among the high school students speaking in favor of the book was
Joanne Savage.
   ``To remove the book from the taught reading in the curriculum
would be a step in the wrong direction,'' she said.
   ``The book has the ability to provoke much thoughtful discussion
about this problem (racism) instead of ignoring it and pretending
that it is solved,'' Joanne said.
   After receiving complaints last year about ``Huckleberry Finn,''
the Plano Independent School District hired a University of North
Texas assistant professor in English to give teachers lessons about
how to present Huck with sensitivity.
   Perry doubted that is working.
   ``When someone assumes they can teach the word `nigger' in a way
that is not offense, I have a problem. It can't be done,'' he said.
   ``The word has a searing effect that just goes to the soul of a
black person.'' Perry said. ``By its very nature and design it is
intended to be extremely offensive, take away your identity and
destroy your soul.''
   He suggested that a better step toward sensitizing students
would be for the school district to recognize February as Black
History Month and conduct appropriate programs.
