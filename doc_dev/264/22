THE GRANTA BOOK OF THE AMERICAN SHORT STORY edited by Richard Ford Granta
Books Pounds 16.99, 710 pages
'ALL MODERN American literature' said Ernest Hemingway, 'comes from one book
by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.' Hemingway was referring to Twain's
vernacular style which, if he did not actually invent it, he made triumphant
use of. This, often coupled with the use of the first person, has enabled
post-Twain American writers to tackle in a wholly satisfying way an area of
life which can sometimes prove a minefield.
Simply put, this area of life deals with the superficially humdrum
experiences of ordinary people, and in particular the poignant transition
from innocence to experience. Sherwood Anderson's story 'I'm A Fool' is a
good example, but Ring Lardner, William Carlos Williams, John Steinbeck,
Erskine Caldwell and Hemingway himself have also made this area their own.
Nowhere is their skill more apparent than in the short story. It is
therefore particularly interesting to have a 700-odd page anthology of
American stories selected by one of their younger writers.
Somerset Maugham, who produced an equally large collection in 1947, asserted
that 'in none of the countries of Europe has the short story been so
assiduously cultivated as in the United States.' Richard Ford does not seem
convinced. In his rambling introduction he is strangely offhand about the
distinctive contribution of American writers.
He quotes - with some disbelief - Frank O'Connor's praise in 1962, but he
does not seem to have read Maugham or any of the other commentators who have
hit the same note - HE Bates, for example, who professed an 'abiding respect
for the short story in America'. Apart from this one feels that The Granta
Book of the American Short Story should have been sub-titled . . . since the
Second World War, for that is where it starts. Everyone else begins with
Irving, Hawthorne, Poe, Melville, James, Crane et alia.
Not that this matters very much, provided the guidelines are made clear. But
Richard Ford does not make them clear. In fact he is so downbeat that we
could be dealing with his namesake, Harrison. It is only after reading all
of his selected 43 stories that one realises what he is driving at.
He begins with some old chestnuts of the forties and fifties - for example,
Paul Bowles's account of the professor who had his tongue cut out in North
Africa, Robert Penn Warren's 'Blackberry Winter', Shirley Jackson's 'The
Lottery' and Flannery O'Connor's 'Good Country People'. These stories reveal
the underside of human nature without any attempt at catharsis.
With Donald Barthelme's 'The Indian Uprising' (another favourite anthology
piece) we enter the post-modernist sixties. But there is only a breath of
this before we are ushered into the true holy land, the land of Raymond
Carver, Oregonian manual labourer and master of the minimalist mode.
Carver is king because he successfully follows Ford's own approach to
fiction, that is, that you write because 'lived life somehow isn't enough'.
Carver's contribution is therefore a significant advance over the nastiness
of Bowles and the naturalistic melodrama of Flannery O'Connor. His writing
is not only in the vernacular but flat, low keyed, understated. It is also
strangely moving, reminiscent in fact of that neglected master Ring Lardner,
who was so admired by that other Middle Western writer, Ernest Hemingway.
And it was of course Hemingway who propounded the iceberg theory of
literature - that you show only one-fifth of your material. The other
four-fifths lie below the surface.
The criterion is what Hemingway called 'writing truly', for which purpose he
said the writer had to have a built in 'shit-detector'. Carver undoubtedly
had one of these useful pieces of equipment and so presumably does Ford,
although he modestly leaves himself out. Blake insisted on 'minute
particulars'. TS Eliot said that the art lay in finding the 'objective
correlative'.
Ford calls it finding the 'fact' ('Standards almost always come after the
fact'). That is why the last story - 'The Things They Carried', by Tim
O'Brien, about the Vietnam war - strikes the right note. Richard Ford's
anthology shows how successfully contemporary American writers have returned
to the path that Twain trod, even though that path is by now a six-lane
highway.
