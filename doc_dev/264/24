   Censorship attempts ranging from book bannings
to protests of AIDS education made 1989-90 the worst year on record
for academic freedom in the public schools, an advocacy group said
Wednesday.
   People for the American Way, a liberal organization that focuses
on constitutional liberty issues, said it documented 244 attacks on
freedom to learn _ up from 172 incidents it cited in 1988-89.
   This year's total was the highest since the group began its
annual survey in 1982, but it probably represents only a fraction
of all the incidents that occurred, the report said.
   ``The censorship movement in America is flourishing,'' said
Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way.
   ``From novels to television programs to fine art to music to
movies to textbooks, we are witnessing an explosion of censorship,
an explosion sparked by the match of far right and religious right
intolerance,'' Kropp said.
   But the report also said only about one-third of the censorship
attempts succeeded this year, while the others were rejected by
principals, school boards or other officials.
   In 1988-89, about 50 percent of the attempts succeeded.
   Thirty-nine states had at least one documented incident, but 114
of the incidents _ 46 percent _ occurred in the West.
   California led with 70. Oregon was second with 16, followed by
Washington and New York with 14 each, Michigan with 13 and Florida
and Texas with 12 each.
   The report attributed California's total to activities by
right-wing religious groups waging a campaign to change
state-approved curricula and reading lists.
   Those groups have focused on Impressions, a reading series for
kindergarten through sixth grade published by a subsidiary of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
   The series features stories, poems and literary excerpts,
including writings by Martin Luther King Jr., C.S. Lewis and Laura
Ingalls Wilder. There also are fantasy stories, some dealing with
witches and goblins.
   Educators have praised Impressions, but critics say the books
promote Satanism, witchcraft and rebellion against parents and
other authority figures, Kropp said. Others describe the material
as violent and depressing.
   Many of the California incidents in the People for the American
Way report involve Impressions. The series was removed from
classrooms in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. An attempt to ban the books in
Redondo Beach, Calif., failed. A court battle is under way in
Dixon, Calif.
   The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of Traditional Values
Coalition of Anaheim, Calif., which opposes the series, said it
contains some good literature. But some of the writings promote a
``New Age'' religion, he said.
   ``It has stories and characters that demean and denigrate
traditional values and beliefs,'' Sheldon said.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich said in a statement: ``We are not
going to be intimidated by self-appointed guardians of local
reading standards.''
   The Impressions series provides ``instructional experiences that
build and strengthen reading ability while allowing students to
experience overall enjoyment and excitement in reading,'' the
company said.
   Meanwhile, efforts continued from Florida to Colorado to require
that textbooks give the biblical account of creation and downplay
evolution, People for the American Way said.
   Book bannings were sought across the nation for use of offensive
words, the report said. Among works critics sought to be removed
from school libraries and classroom reading lists were Mark Twain's
``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why
the Caged Bird Sings,'' and Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   Sex education and AIDS instruction were attacked in Alabama, New
York and South Carolina, the report said.
   In several Texas communities, students were prohibited from
wearing jewelry, clothing or symbols thought to be associated with
Satanism.
