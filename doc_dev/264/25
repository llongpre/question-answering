CHALLENGES TO SCHOOL MATERIALS.

Books, films and other school materials have been challenged as objectionable 
by parents and organized groups in about 150 California school districts during 
the last two years, a Cal State Fullerton professor reported Thursday in the 
state's first comprehensive study on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 421 school districts also found that the number of challenges is 
similar to what it has been in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Education Professor Louise Adler said that more than 54% of the administrators 
who responded reported that the number of challenges during the survey period 
-- autumn, 1988, through spring, 1990 -- is about the same as in previous 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers succeeded in removing the material from schools only 13% of the 
time during the period surveyed, Adler found. In 71% of the cases, schools 
continued to use the material, or excused the child of the challenger when it 
was used. 
</P>
<P>
About half the 300 reported challenges were based on religious grounds, 
including depictions of Satan or witchcraft in such classics as "Macbeth" or 
"Snow White." Popular films, such as "E.T.", and Sports Illustrated's annual 
swimsuit issue also have met with challenges from people who object to their 
being shown at school or available in school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
But far from being a trend on the rise, Adler found that people have objected 
for generations to what children read, something that generally goes unreported 
in all but the most sensational cases. 
</P>
<P>
Adler presented her findings in Sacramento on Thursday to the Educational 
Congress of California, the California Teachers Assn. and the California School 
Boards Assn., the groups that help fund her work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not new -- it's been going on ever since Colonial times in this 
country," Adler said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of having common schools that are meant for everyone in a very 
pluralistic society with many different religious and ethnic groups," she said. 
"There's that inherent tension there." 
</P>
<P>
What is disturbing, Adler said, is that nearly a fourth of the school districts 
responding lack formal policies to handle such objections. "It means that 
either a district will not give someone a fair hearing, or someone will just 
remove a text without really considering what should be done," said Adler, a 
former school board member of the Saddleback Valley Unified District in Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
According to a national watchdog group based in Washington, censorship is on 
the rise in schools and libraries across the country. People for the American 
Way, an advocacy group opposed to what it views as censorship, documented 244 
challenges nationwide during the 1989-90 school year, with California 
accounting for nearly a third of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
But Adler, who did her doctoral dissertation at Claremont Graduate School on 
challenges to school materials, said she launched the survey last year after 
discovering there had been no comprehensive assessment of the number and type 
of challenges in California school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Only 40% of the state's districts responded. Of these, 35.6% reported 
challenges and only about a fourth were covered by the media, the survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
The most-questioned text or material was the "Impressions" reading series for 
elementary school youngsters. "Satanic" and "witchcraft" were the most-cited 
words used by those raising objections. "Religious conflict" was the 
second-most used term. More than 65% of the challengers were parents, and many 
of those were members of religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Foglia, president of the California Teachers Assn., said the findings show 
that the threat of censorship is rife in California. 
</P>
<P>
"These attacks are not just plain challenges," Foglia said. "They are a direct 
attack on our democratic and educational institutions. . . . And it's not 
happening in just a few places. It's happening across the country." 
</P>
<P>
But the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, whose Anaheim-based Coalition for Traditional 
Values led the fight to remove the "Impressions" series in at least 10 school 
districts around the state, accused Adler of deliberately downplaying the 
breadth of the movement.
