GRUMPY OLD MEN (12) Donald Petrie

HOSTILE HOSTAGES (15) Ted Demme
A BUSINESS AFFAIR (15) Charlotte Brandstrom
What are the constituents of North American popular culture? Let me start
with my postbag. I returned from Cannes to find two outraged letters from
trans-oceanic readers, one calling me anti-Canadian, the other
anti-American.
In the first case I had quoted Leslie Nielsen as saying he was brought up
near the Arctic, although his birthplace is, says the correspondent,
'further from the Arctic Circle than is London.' I and fellow journalists
are accused of conspiring to paint Canada as 'one boring, amorphous lump
somewhere in the frozen north.'
In the second case, a Washington DC reader resents my claim that many US
citizens 'have not heard of Arthur Miller, Einstein or the Pope.'
I am, as you know, a registered acolyte of western Atlantic culture high and
low. But part of that culture's appeal is the thin line between inert
honesty and productive hyperbole. Nielsen was the one who played fast and
loose with the Arctic's location. And while I have not personally polled
America about Arthur Miller and Co, recently large numbers of America's
youth did fail to answer the question 'Who was Adolf Hitler?'
Let us come to Grumpy Old Men and The Adventures Of Huck Finn. The first is
a Walter Matthau/Jack Lemmon comedy shot in what looks like the Arctic
Circle - huts on frozen rivers, fishing through ice - but is actually no
further north than Minnesota. And Huck Finn is about an American boy's dream
of living a life of eternal truancy. Truancy from home, parents, education:
in short, from what we shall hereinafter call EEBF (Everyone Else's Boring
Facts).
If Finn lived today, he would be a movie addict, where respectable truth is
ritually sacrificed to radiant embroidery. The same spirit fills Grumpy Old
Men as fills LN's assertion that he grew up cheek-by-jowl with the Eskimoes.
We are asked to believe that Matthau and Lemmon both fall for new neighbour
Ann-Margret and that she, an auburn-haired knockout even at 50, would be
ardently torn between the two codgers.
Grumpy Old Men does not so much 'stretch' plausibility as strain, split and
finally lacerate it. But I found the film fun in direct ratio to its
increases in absurdity. Matthau as a Don Juan? He looks more like a
basset-hound trapped in a fridge. Lemmon as a sweet monastic widower? He
looks more like Mr Executive Stress sent for a rest-cure to the icy north.
But this is what movies are about. Hire that star; push him up that mountain
towards Peak Preposterous; then have him tell his interviewers he was born
in Katmandu, Spitsbergen or El Dorado.
Grumpy Old Men is no masterpiece but it coaxed a cool Dollars 70m from
Americans who know a class comic double act when they see one. The
Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn is a masterpiece, on page, but has an odd
habit of defeating people on screen. Twain's Mississippi was of the mind,
just like Nielsen's remembered Regina, and his hymn to childhood fantasy,
otherwise definable as the flight from EEBF, resists photographic
re-enactment.
Elijah Wood is a tousled, puckish Huck with eyes like UFOs. And Jason
Robards as the King of Bilgewater, Twain's master fraudster, won gusts of
laughter from the press show audience with his DIY cockney accent and A-Z
knowledge of English landmarks. 'Where's Buckingham Palace?' Robards:
'Buckingham.' But the book's real magic is the river, and that is skimped:
even though cameraman Janusz Kaminski, Schindler's List Oscar-winner, might
have worked wonders if allowed out for long enough.
Hostile Hostages is unhappier proof of our assertion that many Americans
cannot have heard of the playwright, physicist and papal eminence cited
above. If they had, this 'comedy' might have a less casual attitude towards
dramatic structure, space-time improbabilities and marital break-up.
Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey play the bickering couple whose car and, later,
home are hi-jacked by a fleeing burglar. As the footpad who referees their
rows - the film's US title was The Ref - stand-up comic Dennis Leary looks
as if he wished he had never sat down in his Disney actor's chair. Feeble
dialogue destabilises an already strained plot conceit, and only dear Glynis
Johns as Mum-in-law - how they wheel out the English actors for villain
roles] - floats above the hi-concept banality.
A Business Affair is set in London, but might be set in the Arctic for all
resemblances to life in this city. The film is funny, but how much is it
meant to be? Jonathan Pryce is the egomaniacal English writer married to
model and would-be novelist Carole Bouquet (French). And Christopher Walken
is the snaky, Italian-extracted American publisher who steals La Bouquet
plus her works-in-progress.
Director Charlotte Brandstrom approaches William Stadiem's script, drawn
from two novels by Barbara Skelton, like a headmistress approaching a
difficult but talented pupil. Her no-nonsense style irons the irony out of
lines that we assume to be satirical but cannot be sure: 'I can't negotiate
with Amis in a condition of frustration. I'm Sicilian' (Walken to sex-bored
Bouquet).
I hoped Martin Amis would walk in, pick up his dropped name and hurl it
among the cameras, causing the film to jump about and get some style. With
Walken and Pryce both in mint form - the first a flaky-voiced dandy with
dancing eyes and teeth, the second tall, slim and deadly like an explosive
pencil - the histrionic components are here. But the movie's own rhythms are
relentlessly four/four, and Bouquet has yet to acquire enough convincing
English phrasing to wrap around even simple lines.
'Why not call eet a naaht?' the actress asks at one point, causing us
critics to nod in agreement. But no rest for culture monitors: it is
half-term and the world is full of children's films. Besides Twain we have
Rookie Of The Year and Josh And SAM Rookie (PG) is about a small boy (Thomas
Ian Nicholas) who develops a miraculous pitching arm after an accident and
plays baseball for the Chicago cubs. This made much money in America and we
see why. Played for frantic charm, it has a frantic charm. Actor Daniel
Stern debuts as director.
Josh And SAM (12, director Billy Weber) is the lesser tale of a boy who
persuades his brother Sam that he (Sam) is a Strategically Altered Mutant;
hence name. As a result they travel all over America escaping from parents,
schools and EEBF. In short, they are just like Huck Finn, Les Nielsen and
the rest of us who love that wonderful world called Imagination and who will
not be put off by Cantankerous of Canada or Apoplectic of America.
