A few months ago, Ruth Lerner of Pacific Palisades asked me to recommend 10 
works of American fiction for her son, who is sojourning in China. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was allowed only 44 pounds of luggage, he took only Chinese-English 
dictionaries, reference works and guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
He asked his mother to send him one paperback American novel a month -- books 
that he could leave behind. He said he wanted the best in American fiction. 
There was one caveat: The books must not be highly sexual or political. Her son 
was afraid they might be confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
The reason I have been so long in responding to Mrs. Lerner is that I can't 
think of any good American novels that aren't loaded with sex and politics. 
What other subjects are there? 
</P>
<P>
My first thought was to recommend books that made me laugh. But most of them 
were full of sex. Nothing is funnier. 
</P>
<P>
For example, any list of 10 good American novels should include "Comfort Me 
With Apples" or any other book by Peter De Vries. That most of his sex scenes 
turn out disastrous doesn't make them any the less funny. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of recommending "For Whom the Bell Tolls," by Ernest Hemingway. Every 
young man ought to read Hemingway. But of course it is loaded with politics, 
and there's that scene where Robert Jordan and Maria make love in a sleeping 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of "Unknown Man No. 89," by Elmore Leonard. It's about two alcoholics 
who rehabilitate each other, fall in love, and skin a con man who is trying to 
skin her. No politics, but some very good sex. Out it goes. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to recommend "The Girl in the Plain Brown Wrapper," or any other of 
John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series; but McGee can't get through a book 
without bringing about the recovery of some sexually frustrated young woman by 
personal therapy, applied in bed. Much too sexy for China. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorky Park," by Martin Cruz Smith, is a gripper, but I'm afraid it won't do, 
either. It's about nothing else but sex and politics. The two seem to be 
related, in some sinister way. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking for Rachel Wallace," by Robert B. Parker, is an excellent novel, 
disguised as a private-eye yarn. It's full of gratifying dialogue between 
Spenser, the private eye, and Rachel Wallace, a lesbian-feminist advocate. But 
the subject matter is sexual politics, which I suppose would be a double whammy 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
He might get away with "The Big Sleep," by Raymond Chandler. There is a 
ding-a-ling female in it who tends to take her clothes off at unpropitious 
moments, but there is no explicit sex. Chandler had a guilt complex about sex. 
Consequently, his hero, Philip Marlow, almost never gets into bed with the 
numerous femmes fatales in Chandler's novels. The politics is strictly local -- 
mostly about corrupt cops. 
</P>
<P>
If he hasn't read it already, I think the young man ought to read "The New 
Centurions," or anything else by Joseph Wambaugh; but, alas, Wambaugh's books 
reek of kinky sex, and degeneracy of other kinds. Not for any nation that 
doesn't want its people to know what its problems are. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Lerner asked her son about Mark Twain, and he told her he had already read 
"Tom Sawyer" and "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." Well, that leaves "A 
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," which I thought was hilarious when 
I read it at the age of 12. On the other hand, there is a lot of subtle 
political satire in "Connecticut Yankee," although, as I remember, it is free 
of explicit sex. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that Mrs. Lerner's son has laid down restrictions that eliminate 
almost every good book. I really don't know of a good adult novel that isn't 
concerned with politics or sex, and usually both. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of recommending "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," by L. Frank Baum, which 
is thought of as a children's classic. But few books are as loaded with sexual 
frustrations as "Wizard." We have a cowardly lion, a tin man and a scarecrow, 
all symbols of the sexually-dysfunctional male. All, obviously, are pedophiles 
in love with the adolescent heroine. Hollywood has exploited few more depraved 
themes than "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
In good conscience, I'm afraid I can recommend only the Horatio Alger books and 
the Rover Boys.
