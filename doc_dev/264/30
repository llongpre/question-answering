<LEADPARA>  New Jerseyite Anne Hiltner is suing Stephen King, claiming he plagiarized from
her writings and based a character in "Misery" on her. She adds the curious
charge that King burglarized her home to steal manuscripts.;    King's
attorney, Arthur Green, said this week that he had not been served with the
lawsuit but said he is "well aware" of Hiltner. "Nothing about what she does
surprises me. We've been dealing with her for a long time."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  (hbox);    A difference of opinion has developed as to who owns the manuscript
for the first half of "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.";    That venerable
ream is claimed by Barbara Gluck Testa and her sister Pamela Gluck Lindholm,
who found it in a trunk belonging to their late grandfather. They are opposed
by the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library, which claims said grandfather
was supposed to have picked up the manuscript from Mark Twain back in 1885 to
deliver it to the library.;    The sisters say they want to unite the
manuscript with its mate -- the second half of Twain's tale -- at the library.
But the library is offering only a modest finder's fee.; (hbox);    An L.A.
judge has ruled that Peggy Lee should receive $2.3 million of $3.8 million
awarded her by a jury in her lawsuit against Walt Disney Co. over
videocassette profits from "Lady and the Tramp.";    Reporters at the scene
are waiting for one side or the other (or maybe both) to appeal the ruling.  </TEXT>
