College seniors don't know much about history or literature. Nearly a quarter 
of them did not know that Franklin D. Roosevelt was President during the 
Depression, and an equal number identified an excerpt from "The Communist 
Manifesto" as part of the U.S. Constitution, according to findings of a study 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Gallup Poll result also suggests considerable ignorance of other basic 
facts. One-fourth of those polled were unaware that Christopher Columbus landed 
in the Western Hemisphere before 1500. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60% of those surveyed did not know the Korean War started during 
President Harry S. Truman's term (14% thought it began while John F. Kennedy 
was in the White House); 58% did not know that William Shakespeare wrote "The 
Tempest." Only 58% of the students knew that the Koran is a sacred text of 
Islam; 12% identified it as a Jewish text, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
The survey consisted of 87 questions with multiple-choice answers. 
</P>
<P>
"If the students' answers were to be graded, more than half of those tested 
would have failed," concluded the report on the study, which was conducted for 
the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the results, NEH Chairwoman Lynne V. Cheney on Sunday called for 
colleges and universities to revise their curricula so that undergraduates must 
study "essential areas of knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
In a booklet titled "50 Hours," she suggested a core curriculum for teaching 
"basic landmarks of history and thought." 
</P>
<P>
About 55% of the students, surveyed in the spring of their senior year, 
answered fewer than 60% of the questions correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Even more troubling, the report said, was that more than a third of the 
questions were taken from a 1986 test designed for 17-year-olds. When only 
those questions expected to be answered correctly by most 17-year-olds were 
considered, 49% of the college seniors still failed. 
</P>
<P>
The students even had trouble with five history questions from citizenship 
tests for immigrants. Only two of those questions were answered correctly by a 
high proportion of students. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 696 students at 67 colleges who took the test, 68% failed the literature 
section and 39% failed the history section. 
</P>
<P>
About 83% of them did not know that T. S. Eliot wrote "The Wasteland" and "The 
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock;" 58% could not identify Plato as the author of 
"The Republic." 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, 95% knew that Mark Twain wrote "The Adventures of 
Huckleberry Finn." 
</P>
<P>
Some 42% of the students could not place the Civil War within half a century, 
and 55% could not identify the Magna Carta. 
</P>
<P>
About 23% of them said that the phrase, "From each according to his ability, to 
each according to his need," was part of the U.S. Constitution instead of "The 
Communist Manifesto" of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. 
</P>
<P>
On average, men scored higher than women, and the seniors in private schools 
had higher scores than public university students. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that many colleges and universities award bachelor's degrees to 
students who have taken no courses in history, literature, science or 
mathematics. He urged that trustees and administrators support faculty efforts 
to strengthen general education requirements.
