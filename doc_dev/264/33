   A revival of Mighty Mouse cartoons, a
junior high school drama and three shows on the Constitution's
anniversary were among 23 programs honored by a children's
television advocacy group Thursday.
   Action for Children's Television presented its annual
achievement awards to radio and video programs from Boston to
Portland, Ore., at its 20th anniversary celebration.
   ``These are programs that have something special to pat them on
their back,'' said Peggy Charren, who founded the 15,000-member
organization that monitors children's programming. ``This is what
children need and deserve from TV.''
   Among the winners in the commercial television category was the
updated ``Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures'' by animator Ralph
Bakshi, who created the 1971 feature-length ``adult'' cartoon
``Fritz the Cat.''
   ```Mighty Mouse' is TV animation the way it used to be,''
Charren said. ``It's not trying to sell something and it has
something to say to children even while it's showing Mighty Mouse
come to save the day.''
   The cartoon originally appeared on television from 1955 to about
1966.
   ``It doesn't talk down to children,'' said Bakshi, 48, who also
made ``The Lord of the Rings'' and ``Heavy Traffic'' in the 1970s.
``I wanted to make sure the level of writing was not below an adult
level.''
   ACT had a separate award category for programs about the 200th
anniversary of the Constitution. Among the winners was CBS' ``The
Day They Came To Arrest the Book,'' based on a story by journalist
Nat Hentoff about attempts to ban Mark Twain's novel ``Huckleberry
Finn.''
   In public television, ACT gave an award to ``Degrassi Junior
High'' from WGBH in Boston, which it called ``a stimulating TV
series on adolescents in action.''
   But Charren said the 1987-88 awards reflected a dearth of news
programming for children, citing the demise of CBS's ``In the
News'' and other news shows in the last year. ACT last fall began
campaigning for an increase in news for children.
   ``It's so important because this is the information that kids
need so that when they to be 18 they can vote,'' Charren said.
``You can't pick that up from the kinds of newscasts kids listen
to.''
   Charren also criticized commercial broadcasters for caving in to
promotional interests and ratings, saying that from 1984-87 about
70 Saturday morning children's shows featured characters based on
toys.
