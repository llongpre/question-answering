<LEADPARA>  IT'S early in the morning -- early for me, at least -- and the sun is
slanting, filtered and white, through trees ruffled by the slightest of
breezes.;   I'm here so early at the California State Library to learn about
banned books: specifically, to see the library's Banned Books Week display,
just inside the wide open doors of the third-floor library entrance.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Libraries are, eternally, hushed and peaceful places -- places I love. Old
wooden card catalog drawers fill the walls, gleaming under the high, coffered
ceiling. On a partition behind the main desk is a color poster of a child:
"Start Small. Kids Who Read Succeed.";   Inside three small display cases are
21 books banned over the centuries for any number of reasons.;   "The Diary of
Anne Frank," opened to a page bearing a photo of doomed, gently smiling Anne
Frank. "A real downer," decided an Alabama group in 1983.;   "One Hundred
Years of Solitude," by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, which the brilliant folks at
Wasco Union High School in California banned from their required reading list
in 1986, dismissing it as "garbage being passed off as literature.";   "The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," called "trash, and suitable only for the
slums," when the Concord, Mass., public library banned it.;   And of course,
"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language," which schools from
Alaska to Missouri to Folsom -- our own Folsom, for heaven's sake -- tried to
ban for objectionable language.;   Yes, language can be so very objectionable,
so disturbing. So can ideas. Kill them before they grow.;   When the library's
outreach service manager, Kathy Low, and Vicky Lockhart from the California
State Library Foundation set out to pull books from the shelves for the
exhibit, they discovered more than a few missing. Not checked out; gone.;   "A
lot of them had disappeared," says Low. "Maybe there was an unofficial censor
in our own office. It's a suspicion we have. 'Tropic of Cancer' and a lot of
things controversial at the time seem to be missing.";   The urge to censor,
it seems, is not limited to fringe extremists. "There are several groups
tracking censorship across the United States," says Low. "According to People
for the American Way, there were 244 censorship attempts in 39 states during
the 1989-90 school year. California recorded the highest number that year --
69 incidents. "And there's still the whole 'Impressions' textbook series in
California.";   The "Impressions" series of readers inspired recent lawsuits
by parents in the California communities of Dixon and Woodland -- and no doubt
other parts of the state -- against their school districts, charging that the
books were violent and demonic.;   "It will probably go on for some time,"
says Low.;   As will attempts to censor the written word, in fact.;   "To me,
literature is very personal," she says. "Everyone interprets it differently.
It's hard to say what makes people censor.";   My guess would be fear. They're
threatened and have a need to control, these brain police.;   "A lot of the
challenges to libraries and schools," says Low, "come from individual parents"
who find a book offensive or inappropriate for their own children and feel
comfortable making decisions on behalf of other people and other people's
children, as well.;   "And what I think is what everybody thinks, right?" says
Low.;   Books from the "Impressions" series aren't included in the Banned
Books display. Neither are "The Catcher in the Rye" -- which for some reason
seems to be on everyone's list of classics ripe for banning -- or "1984" or
Descartes' "Meditations" or "All Quiet on the Western Front.";   There are all
sorts of reasons behind each book ban: "1984" was deemed pro-Communist in a
red-hating world; "All Quiet on the Western Front" was considered -- dear God
-- anti-war.;   But "The Diary of Anne Frank"?;   Yes, it's a real downer. In
a moving, enlightening kind of way. The true threat would be in not reading.  </TEXT>
