I have written before that one of the great joys of the English summer -
even better this year than cricket - is the Open Theatre in full swing at
London's Regent's Park. So it is with the Rodgers and Hart musical A
Connecticut Yankee. If you don't know Mark Twain's delightful story about
the east coast American at the court of King Arthur, read it on holiday. It
is much more fun than Huckleberry Finn. But it will do no harm to see the
musical first.
A Connecticut Yankee could have been written for outdoor production,
especially as night falls and there is a total eclipse of the sun which
saves the Yankee from almost certain execution by immolation. Actually, this
scene should be even better as the summer wears on. At the end of July in
London, it is not quite dark enough for the full effect.
The musical is not as subtle as the book. Corny would be a more accurate
description, but the corn is of a high order. When Sir Lancelot's old armour
is wheeled on stage, it is described as Esquire Magazine's idea of what the
well-dressed man was wearing in the year 543.
Quite the best sequence comes with the entry of Anna Nicholas as Morgan Le
Fay. Ms Nicholas has played the rejected bride-to-be when we were still in
the US Navy in the 20th century at the start of the show. Now she is
magnificent, dressed in scarlet and black carrying a riding crop and
occasionally showing a leg. She sings a song called 'To Keep My Love Alive'
which has the audience straining to catch every clever word. Never the
bridesmaid, always the bride, Morgan Le Fay explains that the reason she has
not been unfaithful to her husbands and lovers is that she bumped them off
before the need arose. When ill-at-ease, she kills at ease.
The trick of the song is that it combines romantic music with a cerebral
lyric. Stephen Sondheim plainly learnt a lot from it. There are other
treasures. I liked the rhymes: venison and Tennyson, sweethearts and
indiscreet hearts, damn a lot and Camelot, even, stretching it a bit,
possibilities and ill-at-ease. Unusually for Regent's Park, the show compels
attention from the beginning. Not even the external distractions can compete
with the boisterousness of the US Navy. Once the Navy has established a
beachhold, it is natural to slip into the more sentimental mood of 'My Heart
Stood Still'.
Later on, the customary distractions are put to good use. There is a
helicopter in the script though not, as in Miss Saigon, shown on stage. In
Regent's Park it is a customary sound. The aerial feat comes in two
miniature light aircraft flying down a wire across the top of the arena. The
audience, glancing at the sky for the real thing, applauds - and rightly -
this bit of the design by Paul Farnsworth, like Ariel putting a girdle round
the earth.
Other parts of the design are a trifle creaky. One would not be entirely
surprised if the towers in this Camelot fell down, but it would be in
keeping with such a zany show if they did and you can be confident that the
cast would rise to it, just as they dealt with Ms Nicholas when she lost her
shoe early on. There is a wonderful wizard in Christopher Biggins as Merlin.
Ian Talbot, the presiding spirit over the Regent's Park venture, directs.
The theatre on the first night was full to the tree-tops, as it deserves to
be for the rest of the summer.
