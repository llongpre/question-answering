On a magical night 25 years ago this month, an ancient boxing shaman told me a 
story without an ending, a fabulous gift that transformed me into the most 
rewarded of genre writers, the novelist for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, I only knew I was in Las Vegas to cover the heavyweight title 
match between Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson, and that this old man, Cus 
D'Amato, who had once managed Floyd, was a reporter's trove of arcana and 
insight. After dinner, we sat by the deserted, neon-splashed swimming pool of 
our casino hotel and Cus reminisced about the night he had waited by the door 
of his old ghetto gym, listening for the footsteps of a "contender." 
</P>
<P>
If a kid came up those dark, narrow, twisting flights of stairs alone and 
running scared, said Cus, there was a chance he might stay with it, hang tough, 
find himself through dedication and sacrifice. Fear, said Cus, was like a fire. 
It can destroy you or it can make you a hero, a contender in the ring and in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
I sat up the rest of that night aflame. To me, at 27, becoming a contender 
meant writing fiction. I had never made it up those stairs because I had 
nothing to say. But now I had questions to answer. What kind of kid would come 
up those dark stairs? What would he be running from? Toward? There was only one 
way to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, when I got back to New York after the fight, there was a letter 
from the Junior Books department of Harper &amp; Row, wondering if I had "ever 
considered writing a novel with the ring as its milieu." 
</P>
<P>
Funny you should ask. I've started already. All I can tell you is that the book 
will have dark, narrow, twisting stairs, and that it will be titled "The 
Contender." 
</P>
<P>
Because the novel was short and linear, sexless (though violent), and the 
protagonist was 17 years old, it was packaged for a newly created market, Young 
Adult, 12-and-up. It was published in 1967 and rode a literary wave. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Ursula Nordstrom and Charlotte Zolotow of Harpers, a dedicated band of 
editors, teachers and librarians created a bridge of words from illustrated 
children's books to a lifetime of reading with the novels of such disparate 
writers as S. E. Hinton ("The Outsiders"), M. E. Kerr ("Dinky Hocker Shoots 
Smack"), Paul Zindel ("The Pigman"), Robert Cormier ("The Chocolate War") and 
Judy Blume ("Forever"). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, literature for adolescents thrived before books were branded YA. 
What is "Huckleberry Finn," "Little Women" and "The Catcher in the Rye"? But 
now there were suddenly textbooks, learned journals, library specialists, 
graduate studies, all supported by publishing departments filling orders for 
designated bookstore and library shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Contender" was a commercial and critical success, the boom went 
on without me. I left sportswriting to write old adult novels and screenplays 
with varying success. But nothing came close to the response I was getting from 
that YA novel, that sense of reaching out and touching lives. White girls from 
Iowa wrote that even though Alfred Brooks was a black boy from Harlem, his 
hopes and fears were theirs. Black boys from Harlem wrote that they read the 
book because they had to, for school, and liked it until the ending. There was 
no ending. What happened to Alfred Brooks? Did he get his friend, James, off 
heroin? Did he finish school? Did he make it as a boxer even though he had no 
killer instinct? 
</P>
<P>
I answered them all, gently suggesting that the next chapter was theirs to 
write. I didn't tell them I considered myself retired, a one-shot YA author, my 
future in rewriting King Lear, not Kid Lear. 
</P>
<P>
And then one magical night 14 years ago, while writing an article for Mother 
Jones on books that had shaped me as a kid, the phrase "in the prison of my 
fat" dropped out of the typewriter. I'd been very fat. How fat? When the number 
200 rolled up on the scale, I bailed out. How did I lose all that fat? Well . . 
. The letters for "One Fat Summer" were surprisingly similar. Younger readers 
make characters their friends. One girl said she understood the fat boy 
perfectly because she was "skinny as a broomstick and six feet tall." 
</P>
<P>
This time, I visited schools and libraries and answered questions. Yes, being 
so fat had made me a reader and a writer; yes, my own children read my books; 
no, I wasn't rich, but meeting them and talking about my characters as if they 
were alive was a thrill beyond royalty statements. But I couldn't answer the 
most frequent question. I didn't know what happened to Alfred Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
I could tell them about Cus, though. A dozen years after our first meeting, he 
heard the footsteps of his contender, an incorrigible 14-year-old who was 
punching apart a reform school near Cus' rural retirement home. One of the 
counselors, a former boxer, asked Cus to help out. Eventually, Cus adopted the 
boy, Mike Tyson. Cus died just before Mike became heavyweight champion of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
By then, I was a television journalist, barely interested in YA, which was now 
firmly established as a lucrative genre for publishers and gifted young 
writers, and a lightning rod for censors. The only time I thought about it was 
when someone I was interviewing, or working with, asked me what happened to 
Alfred Brooks. My generation of readers was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
And then one magical night four years ago, a teen-age Indian boy told me about 
his feelings of being trapped on the reservation, but afraid to leave. He had 
run away once, a triumph of survival, he thought, but he had been returned by 
the police, a humiliating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Would he try again? What was he running from? Toward? There was only one way to 
find out. 
</P>
<P>
The publishing house is called HarperCollins now, and Charlotte Zolotow is 
about to retire, but "The Brave," about a kid boxer, Sonny Bear, half-Indian, 
half-white, who walks into the middle of a Times Square drug war, will be 
published next year under her imprint. 
</P>
<P>
I should be looking for a job right now (my talk show was canceled) or at least 
trying to scare up some deal, but after all these years, I've finally figured 
it out. I, too, want to know what happened to my characters. 
</P>
<P>
Was Sonny Bear's left hook really as good as I thought it was? Does he really 
have a chance to become heavyweight champ? His manager, my first contender, 
Alfred Brooks, who led me up my own dark stairs, thinks Sonny can hang in there 
and go all the way. But for me, there's only one way to find out.
