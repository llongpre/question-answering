   Suntory, which is a major producer of pharmaceuticals as well as
whiskey and beer, built a major concert hall in downtown Tokyo, as
well as an art museum for traditional Japanese art. It holds annual
tennis and golf tournaments and sponsors a yearly jazz festival in
the mountain resort of Madarao. The company even constructed five
bird sanctuaries at its facilities throughout Japan in cooperation
with the Japanese Association for the Preservation of Birds.
   Suntory will have money in at least one more Shubert show this
season _ the Steppenwolf Theater Company's adaptation of John
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' It's among the more eagerly
awaited offerings of the year.
   American musicals have been performed in Japan with Japanese
casts for years. Audiences have long been familiar with ``My Fair
Lady'' and ``West Side Story.'' A Japanese-language version of
``Cats'' was a big success. So was ``Big River,'' based on Mark
Twain's ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' The show even used
the original American star, Ron Richardson, who learned Japanese
for his role but sang most of his songs as the runaway slave Jim in
English.
   But Broadway musicals with American casts were new to Japan in
the early 1980s. Enormously expensive to produce because the
company and scenery had to be flown to Japan, they nevertheless
were able to generate prestige and enormous publicity if not
profits for the sponsoring company.
   ``There's a great promotional aspect to presenting shows in
Japan, much more than there is here,'' Schoenfeld says. ``There is
a corporate identification with a show in Japan. Audiences will
identify `Jerome Robbins' as the Suntory production of `Jerome
Robbins' Broadway' when it plays there in 1991.''
   After ``Dancin','' Suntory, among others, helped take an
American-cast version of ``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies''
to Japan. TV Asahi, one of Japan's biggest television networks,
sponsored a Weissler production of ``My One and Only,'' starring
Tommy Tune and Sandy Duncan. Next fall Weissler will send Topol to
Tokyo and Osaka in ``Fiddler on the Roof'' under the aegis of C.
Itoh, a major shipping conglomerate.
   ``Traditional corporate entertainment was always limited to men
in Japan, but with Broadway shows they could provide dinner and a
musical for a husband and wife,'' says Kenji Kitatani, a vice
president for Tokyo Broadcasting and a professor in
telecommunications management at Indiana University. ``It became a
new tool for large corporations to entertain clients or potential
clients. It was a new way of marketing.
   ``There is more money available in Japan now than ever before,
and all of those elements accelerated the boom of Broadway shows in
Japan.''
   But an investment in the American theater still remains an
uncertain opportunity, no matter who provides the money. Several
Japanese companies have been burned. The musical ``Blues in the
Night,'' done off-Broadway in 1988 with financial backing from TV
Asahi, closed after a short engagement.
   ``3 Penny Opera'' was one of the season's biggest critical and
financial flops. It dropped an estimated $4.5 million, including an
investment from Haruki Kadokawa, head of one of Japan's largest
publishing companies. ``The Secret Rapture'' by David Hare lost
$800,000, some of it Suntory money, during its brief two-week run.
   But Suntory does have an investment in ``City of Angels,'' the
Cy Coleman musical about a private eye in 1940s Los Angeles. It is
the season's biggest new musical hit and the likely Tony winner in
June. And the original cast recording rights have been won, after a
spirited bidding, by CBS Records, which now happens to be owned by
another Japanese company, Sony.
   Kitatani brought Tokyo Broadcasting into ``Gypsy,'' through his
association with one of the producers, Pace International. But
officials of the big Japanese television network only committed
themselves to the show after careful analysis of the property.
   ``The reason they did `Gypsy' was that they believed in it,''
Kitatani says. ``They researched the track record of the producers,
Barry and Fran Weissler. They looked at Tyne Daly's level of
acceptance in the United States and then, of course, they looked at
the past performance record of `Gypsy,' which has been done twice
before on Broadway.
   ``They felt very comfortable betting their money on the show.
You might think that when they are 5,000 miles away from Broadway
they don't study those things, but they do.''
