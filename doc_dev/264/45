   A family whose members travel here each
year from Kentucky and Minnesota for Tom Sawyer Days seems to have
the makings of a fence painting dynasty.
   Tony Youngblood, 12, of Mayfield, Ky., did his part Sunday by
winning this year's fence painting contest. His cousin, Scott
McEndree, 13, of Minnetonka, Minn., was last year's champion.
   The contest is inspired by Tom Sawyer's fence-painting exploits
in Mark Twain's ``Tom Sawyer,'' which is set in Hannibal. In the
book, Tom gets friends to help him whitewash a fence by making the
hated chore appear fun.
   Tony got no such help. He did have the benefit of experience,
though, this being his third year as a contestant.
   His strategy for winning? ``Quality in painting and running,''
he said. ``Each year, I learn a little bit more.''
   The contestants were judged on authenticity of costume, as
described in Twain's writing, as well as speed and quality of
painting.
   As this year's champion, Tony will carry back to Kentucky the
governor's cup, which he will return to Hannibal next summer. He
also won readings by Twain, a plaque and a $500 U.S. Savings Bond.
