   As a boy, Michael Dukakis enjoyed sports books
starring a fellow called ``the Duke'' and young Mario Cuomo learned
the virtues of family from ``Swiss Family Robinson.''
   Two girls named Kay Orr and Rose Mofford read ``Little Women.''
   Those are some of the results of a survey asking the nation's
governors to name their favorite childhood books. The survey,
conducted by Pizza Hut Inc., was to help mark National Young
Reader's Day on Wednesday.
   The most oft-cited gubernatorial favorites were by Mark Twain:
``Tom Sawyer,'' named by 10 governors, and ``Huckleberry Finn,''
cited by a dozen.
   Among others listed by more than one governor were ``Treasure
Island,'' the Dr. Seuss books, ``Black Beauty,'' ``Charlotte's
Web,'' and ``The Red Badge of Courage.''
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard recalled ``Paddle to the Sea'' by
Holling C. Holling, about an Indian boy who built a canoe and
paddled from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. ``I can still
remember feeling like I was part of the trip,'' he said.
   In Washington, Barbara Bush, honorary chairwoman of the Library
of Congress's ``Year of the Young Reader'' project, scheduled a
White House reception Wednesday to boost the cause of children's
reading, press aide Jean Becker said.
