   Potential liability problems
surrounding a tree house that extends two feet over public property
have prompted city officials to give the structure the ax.
   ``It's accessible to the public, and there is the possibility it
could entirely or partially fall on somebody passing by or damage
property,'' said Chief Building Inspector Louis Kidwell.
   The 8-by-6-foot tree house was built by Teresa Macdonald's
father, a contractor, a few months ago as a Christmas present for
her sons, James, 6, and Joey, 4.
   It features wall-to-wall carpeting, a shingled roof and sliding
plexiglass windows and is a popular place for neighborhood children
to play.
   ``If I didn't have school, I'd spend every single day up
there,'' said James Macdonald.
   ``My dad said, `Whatever happened to the days of Huckleberry
Finn and Tom Sawyer?''' said Teresa Macdonald.
   She said she understands the city's concern but added that few
people use the sidewalk on their dead-end street.
   ``I've been up there on the windiest days and nothing has
happened,'' she said. ``We'd have to have an earthquake or a
nuclear war.''
   The Macdonalds have until March 21 to remove the tree house. If
the city doesn't change its mind, they will build a foundation for
it in their back yard and place it there.
