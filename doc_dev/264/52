   James Fenimore Cooper would be alive
today, at least in hearts and minds, if Mark Twain hadn't hammered a
stake through the heart of Natty Bumppo.
   Cooper's demise as the quintessential author of the American
frontier stems from a quirky essay written 44 years after his death,
Dan Porter, director of the New York State Historical Association,
said.
   Mark Twain's ``Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper'' put
Deerslayer, Leatherstocking and Natty's other incarnations out to
pasture somewhere on the prairie of forgotten adventure tales. Natty
Bumppo was the frontiersman who appeared in Cooper's stories found
in the ``The Leatherstocking Tales,'' including ``The Last of the
Mohicans,'' ``The Pathfinder,'' ``The Deerslayer'' and others.
   ``Mark really did him in,'' Porter said.
   The Historical Association is celebrating the 200th anniversary
of Cooper's birth. This summer, Porter hopes to shepherd 150,000
visitors to Cooperstown's Fenimore House and the Farmer's Museum,
both devoted to pioneer life.
   Even so, that turnout will be just half the average summer gate
for the other game in town, the Baseball Hall of Fame, which
celebrated its 50th anniversary this year.
   Porter wants Cooperstown pilgrims to know that Cooper put the
town on the map a decade before reputed baseball inventor Abner
Doubleday created the sport in Cooperstown.
   Unlike Twain, who remains popular, Cooper has been ``relegated to
the status of having written adventure books for kids and shoved on
the shelves of schoolchildren who would be just as happy to shove
him back,'' said Cooper aficionado Hugh MacDougall.
   Even without Twain, the wordiness and sermonizing of ``The Last
of the Mohicans'' and ``The Deerslayer'' probably would have eroded
Cooper's popularity. Cooper had no editor, so his books were printed
the way he wrote them. He considered revising a chore.
   Twain's scorecard credits Cooper with 114 literary offenses in
just two-thirds of a page. Readers couldn't tell Cooper's living
characters from his corpses, and neither showed ``sufficient excuse
for being there,'' Twain wrote.
   Cooper's characters also made the most of dialogue, wrote Twain,
complaining that a Cooper character's mouth ``was a rolling-mill,
and busied itself all day long in turning 4-foot pigs of thought
into 30-foot bars of conversational railroad iron.''
   ``Cooper characterizations may leave something to be desired,''
his great-great-grandson Henry S.F. Cooper Jr. said. ``But he did
create one well-rounded and extraordinary character with Deerslayer.
He has the same strength and immortality as Sherlock Holmes.''
   Early America's most popular writer, Cooper was the first to
break the snob barrier and gain acclaim in Europe.
   ``In Europe his characters came to represent the typical American
of the last century,'' said MacDougall, who has written a guidebook
_ ``Cooper's Otsego County'' _ to local sites important to the
author's works. Cooper drew on the Cooperstown wilderness for many
of his settings.
   Cooper was the first novelist of the American frontier, the first
to write sea novels and the first American author to earn his living
solely as a man of letters.
   His vivid descriptions of landscapes inspired the artworks of his
friends, Thomas Cole and Samuel Morse, and other Hudson River school
painters. Nineteenth century travel books lifted entire Cooper
passages to describe the American frontier.
   ``His place in American literature is unassailable,'' said Henry
Cooper, who writes on space issues for The New Yorker. ``He really
put the American novel on the map. He created the tradition of the
lonely hero, which transcends the Western novel. You can find it in
the novels of Theodore Dreiser and others.''
   Europeans remain fascinated by Cooper's writing. A German film
crew shot a documentary about Cooper last year, and many Europeans
visit Fenimore House each year, Porter said.
   ``The harder (critics) knock him, the more he stands, like one of
those clown balloons with a weight in the bottom that keeps popping
back,'' Henry Cooper said.
   Born Sept. 15, 1789 in Burlington, N.J., Cooper was an infant
when his father moved the family to Otsego Lake, called Glimmerglass
in Cooper's novels. A land speculator, William Cooper had picked up
100,000 acres there in a bankruptcy sale, founding the village that
bears his name.
   Before he started writing in 1819, Cooper was kicked out of Yale
College because of his pranks, went to sea as a common sailor and
served in the Navy.
   His sailing years were grist for such forgotten sea novels as
``The Pilot'' and ``The Red Rover,'' works that influenced Herman
Melville and Joseph Conrad.
   Besides the five Leatherstocking novels, works of social
criticism were among Cooper's 50 books, including a novel about
totalitarianism predating George Orwell's ``1984'' by more than a
century.
   William Eastman, director of the State University of New York
Press, which is publishing Cooper works that have been out of print
for decades, thinks the new Cooper editions will take the bite out
of Twain's essay.
   ``His earlier manuscripts and books were so corrupt, full of
typos and errors, that people sometimes didn't know what he was
writing about,'' Eastman said. ``All those funny things Twain wrote
about were caused by typos. Those things are no longer relevant with
these new editions.''
   ``We're going back to his original manuscripts and correcting the
errors,'' said James Beard, a Cooper specialist at Clark University
in Worcester, Mass., who is working on the new editions. ``Each time
they were reprinted they made new errors.''
   Bypassed by railroads and canals, Cooperstown retains many of its
19th century landmarks. Businesses along the village's narrow
streets also help remind visitors of Cooper's legacy _ Glimmerglass
Restaurant, Mohican Motel, Leatherstocking Travel.
   Cooper lived most of his life in Cooperstown and is buried in his
family's private cemetery there, 100 miles northeast of Twain's
grave in Elmira. Cooper died in 1851.
   Otsego Lake has largely escaped the 20th century, as well. With
no large industries and much of the lakeshore acreage owned by large
landowners, the lake remains pristine compared to those in the
Adirondacks to the north. Credited as the first conservation writer,
Cooper urged preservation of natural resources in many of his books.
   ``Would Cooper be pleased at the condition of his lake? Compared
with other lakes today, yes. Compared with the lake he remembers,
probably no,'' said biologist Bill Harman. Harman heads Oneonta
State College's Biological Field Station on Otsego Lake.
   Cooper became irascible and wrote little in his last years,
instead suing critics for libel and neighbors for trespassing. It
would have been time better spent writing, Porter said.
   Cooper never endeared himself to his public in the way that
turned Alcott, Hawthorne and Thoreau into tourism industries in New
England, he said.
   ``New York has not treated its literary lights well, not as well
as New England has,'' Porter said. ``Had Cooper been less of a
curmudgeon and more in tune with public relations, his fate would
have been better today.''
