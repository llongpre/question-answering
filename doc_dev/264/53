* Mature choices: A new survey says most of the nation's governors recall their 
favorite reading as kids to be typical children's books such as "Huckleberry 
Finn," "The Little Engine That Could" and "Peter Rabbit." But not George 
Deukmejian. California's Republican governor lists his three favorite childhood 
books as "A Tale of Two Cities," "The Making of the President" and "The Book of 
Common Prayer." The survey by a national pizza chain was released Wednesday to 
observe National Young Reader's Day.

* It's over: Gov. Michael S. Dukakis conceded for the first time that the 
Massachusetts Miracle that nearly carried him to the White House is no more. 
But the former Democratic candidate for President said that the formula that 
produced a white-hot economy in the early 1980s can bring Massachusetts back 
from the brink of recession. "The miracle of the '80s may be over, but the 
fundamental strengths that made it happen are still here," he said. Declining 
revenue has left Massachusetts with a $720-million budget deficit.

* One more time: Actor Todd Bridges will be retried on a felony assault charge 
stemming from a shooting at a South-Central Los Angeles drug den, a spokeswoman 
for the district attorney's office said. Bridges, 24, was acquitted last week 
of attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter in the Feb. 2 shooting 
of convicted drug dealer Kenneth (Tex) Clay, but jurors deadlocked on the 
assault charge. Bridges played Willis on the TV series "Diff'rent Strokes."
