   ``E.T.'' actress Drew Barrymore, 13, has been
released from a rehabilitation center after treatment for alcohol
abuse, her publicist said Thursday.
   She was released from the unidentified center ``a couple of days
ago,'' said publicist George Freeman. ``She is in good health and
great spirits.''
   No other details would be provided, Freeman said.
   Miss Barrymore already was an actress with television commercial
and movie experience at age 6 when she played the impetuous Gertie
in ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.''
   The daughter of Hungarian-born actress Ildiko Jaid, third wife of
reclusive John Barrymore Jr., Miss Barrymore is the granddaughter of
John Barrymore, who starred in such film classics as ``Grand Hotel''
and ``Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde.''
   Miss Barrymore also has starred in movies such as ``Altered
States,'' ``Firestarter,'' ``Irreconcilable Differences,'' and
``Cat's Eye.'' She appeared in the made-for-television movies
``Conspiracy of Love'' and ``Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.''
