MYSTERIOUS ELEPHANTS OF THE CONGO; Sunday night at 7 and 9:05 p.m., TBS
(cable); IT SEEMS so simple: A stepfather wants to adopt his late wife's son
by her first marriage. He couldn't love the boy more if he were his own
natural child, and the boy himself dotes on the only father he's ever known.; 
 Yet he never could talk his wife into permitting the adoption while she was
alive. She wouldn't even let him bring the topic up. The reason: her
pathological fear that Jack Griffith, her psychotic ex-husband, would launch a
bitter custody battle as soon as he learned another man was trying to legally
claim his son.;   But now Terry Milner has to do something. He has no legal
right to hold little Jay. If his real father steps forward after hearing about
his ex-wife's death, Jay will have to be handed over to him.;   That's the
tantalizing premise of "Deception: A Mother's Secret," an engrossing melodrama
that premieres Sunday night at 9 on NBC (Chs. 4, 8). Believe me, it's only the
tip of the iceberg.;   Steven Weber of NBC's "Wings" sitcom plays stepfather
Terry Milner, whose desperate search for a way to retain custody of his
stepson leads him down many dark alleys of the human soul. You'll be on edge
all the way and would be well-advised to keep a crying-towel handy for the
devastating climax.;   Terry's first major shock is discovering that his late
wife, played by Mary Page Keller of ABC's "Baby Talk," had not been completely
candid with him about her past. Her behavior is the most puzzling of many
mysteries Terry uncovers. Where is the mysterious Jack Griffith, and why did
he drop out of Jay's life so completely? Why does Jay's birth certificate turn
out to be a clever fake? Why wouldn't his late wife ever let the boy stay
overnight with friends or be long out of her sight?;   Helping Terry trace the
threads of his late wife's past is Terry's mother (Katherine Helmond of ABC's
"Who's the Boss?"), who retains her own bitter memories of her late husband, a
man who deceived her as thoroughly as Terry's wife may have deceived him.;  
This is a deftly devised heart-tugger from producer Sandor Stern, who also
wrote and directed it. It's built around a moving performance by Weber, who'll
have you pulling for him all the way to the gut-wrenching finale. Don't miss
this one.;   Mark Twain and the moppet;   In the last years of his life,
author Mark Twain was a weary, troubled old man, still mourning the death of
his beloved wife and bitterly regretting the time his literary fame had taken
away from his relationship with his daughters. One daughter was already dead,
so there was no chance to make it up to her. And his relationship with his
surviving daughter, Jean, was far from warm.;   That's when a miraculous ray
of sunshine came into his life in the form of 11-year-old Dorothy Quick, a
bright but lonely fatherless child, who became his surrogate daughter.;  
Director Daniel Petrie has transformed the true story of Twain's unorthodox
relationship with little Dorothy into a heartwarming movie for cable's Disney
Channel. (Even many of the cable viewers who don't subscribe to Disney will be
able to tune in, because of a Disney promotion under way on local systems.)
Called "Mark Twain and Me," it features Jason Robards as Twain.;   After
meeting briefly in the lobby of a London hotel in 1908, Twain and Dorothy (Amy
Stewart) became fast friends on the ship voyage home to America. They learned
they had much in common besides a love for his books. Both lost their fathers
during their childhood. Both suffered from chronic bronchitis. And both were
badly missing something in their lives.;   In their brief time together over
the next few years, Dorothy brought Twain out of his gloomy state of mind,
rejuvenated his relationship with his unmarried daughter, Jean (Talia Shire),
and gave him the chance to be the kind of playful dad he'd never been with his
own girls. In return, Twain taught the bookish Dorothy how to live a more
robust life, supplied her with the father figure she longed for and gave her
the self-confidence to launch her own writing career in her adult years.;  
(Quick published 16 books in her lifetime; her last, "Enchantment: A Little
Girl's Friendship with Mark Twain," in 1961, inspired the movie.);   Robards
is marvelous as the blustery Twain, who could rage at a hotel desk clerk for
supplying him with ashtrays too small for his enormous cigars, then playfully
hide from autograph seekers with his 11-year-old "pal" on grounds that, "I'm
famous; I'm old; and I'm a writer. They expect these eccentricities.";  
Robards is the main reason to watch "Mark Twain and Me," but by no means the
only reason. It's a tender, touching family film that will leave you
moist-eyed but feeling warm all over.;   Fonda's African adventure;   It was
only a matter of time until an on-camera assignment resulted from actress Jane
Fonda's romance with cable TV baron Ted Turner. Now the suspense is over, as
Fonda tackles her first job for Turner on Sunday night, hosting the new "World
of Audubon" special, "Mysterious Elephants of the Congo," on Turner's TBS
superstation.;   It's a good role for Fonda, like Turner, an avid
environmentalist. Better yet, her celebrity may bring a new wave of viewers to
this worthy documentary about the seldom-seen forest elephants of Africa.;  
Most of us are familiar with the much larger plains elephants of Africa but
know little about the smaller breed, which live in the dense rain forests
along the Congo River. There are now about 200,000 forest elephants left,
representing about one-third of all the elephants in Africa.;   The film
brings us closer than we've ever been to herds of the skittish beasts, which
have survived in large numbers only because they've been harder for poachers
to find and more expensive to hunt because of their remoteness.;   Though
poachers now are getting to them, the creatures are even more threatened by
the displacement of rain forest with agricultural and grazing land. This is
the dire warning of the fascinating film Fonda has chosen to bring us through
Turner's cable network.  </TEXT>
