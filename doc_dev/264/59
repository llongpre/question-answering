Now the two brothers of Sam Shepard's tense and riveting play True West need
one another; now they are split by mutual jealousy. At first, they seem as
different as Apollo and Dionysus, or Jekyll and Hyde; more crucially, they
resemble Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Then, as the power struggle within
their sibling rivalry develops, they start to swap characters. It appears -
enthrallingly - that each brother is fatally incomplete without the other;
and 'fatal' becomes more or less the word. The play, which started virtually
without plot, winds up in a crescendo of action.
Congratulations to Leeds' West Yorkshire Playhouse and to director Matthew
Warchus for staging this play, and to casting two superlative actors. At the
performance I saw, Mark Rylance was Austin (the younger, more educated,
citified writer) and Michael Rudko was Lee (the older, wild, lone traveller
from the desert). But they exchange roles at alternate performances, and I
am impatient to see them in reverse. Soon, I will have the chance: True West
comes to London's Donmar Warehouse in November. I look forward also to
seeing again, in two small roles, the excellent Marcia Warren's economically
eloquent account of their Mom, and David Henry as (ungrateful role) the
film-producer Saul Kimmer.
No, True West is not a great play. It moves in terms of dichotomies and
parabolas: too schematic. Only occasionally does it relax and add the kind
of unnecessary detail that puts flesh on its lean bones. One such passage is
Austin's hilarious slow narration of how their father lost his teeth. Two
more such passages occur when their Mom talks of (a) Picasso, (b) Alaska.
Later - of course] - we see that Picasso and Alaska are just another pair of
Shepard's dichotomies (civilisation versus the wild, education versus
nature). For that matter, Mom and the unseen Dad are themselves also
artificial polar opposites. All of which is clever, interesting, but not
always real.
Yet True West, as they say, brings up a whole lot of stuff. No-one can miss
the point of the image early on when Austin mounts a stepladder to spray his
mother's house plants, while Lee chucks the beer cans he has finished onto
the floor. Or the chaos later on, when the brothers turn the room into an
urban desert: Lee attacking a broken typewriter with a golf club, Austin
making toast simultaneously in 10 stolen toasters. Even at its most
diagrammatic, the jealousies of brother and brother are shockingly potent.
Warchus' production highlights such moments, but allows the actors to give
performances very close to sheerest transparent. Rudko is so much the
dangerous, needy, plaintive, coyote-like hobo from the desert that I cannot
imagine how he will bring off the opposite role. Rylance, despite one or two
more calculated moments, nonetheless gives an astonishing performance. Just
the way he breathes as, early on, he watches Lee, speaks volumes: as does
the way his soft, grainy voice suddenly finds a driving charge of passion as
he confronts his worst shock of defeat and injustice. I know no male actor
today who can so catch my heart in my throat. This production clinches what
I have felt for some time: that the West Yorkshire Playhouse is the most
vital and refreshing English theatre outside London today.
