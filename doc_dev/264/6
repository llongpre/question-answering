   High schools are requiring students to read
almost exactly what they did 25 years ago: heavy on Shakespeare but
light on works by female and minority authors, according to a
survey.
   Eighty-four percent of public high schools assign students
``Romeo and Juliet,'' the tearful Shakespearean play that tops the
list of required works, according to the nationwide survey by the
Center for the Learning &amp; Teaching of Literature at State
University of New York at Albany.
   But only one of the top 10 most frequently assigned works was by
a female author _ ``To Kill A Mockingbird,'' by Harper Lee. No
works were by minorities, according to the survey of 322 public
schools, 80 Catholic schools and 86 private schools conducted last
spring.
   ``I think the survey shows schools are still very much concerned
with emphasizing good literature. They continue to assign classics
complemented with modern and accessible works,'' said the survey's
author, Arthur N. Applebee.
   ``At the same time, it's disturbing that there are essentially
no books by minority authors working their way into the canons, and
little representation of women.''
   Following ``Romeo and Juliet,'' 81 percent of public high
schools required ``Macbeth.'' ``Huckleberry Finn,'' the classic
Mark Twain novel, was the third most assigned work, with 70 percent
requiring it.
   The rest of the top 10 were, in order, ``Julius Caesar,'' by
Shakespeare, ``To Kill A Mockingbird,'' ``The Scarlet Letter,'' by
Nathaniel Hawthorne, ``Of Mice and Men,'' by John Steinbeck,
Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,'' ``The Great Gatsby,'' by F. Scott
Fitzgerald, and ``Lord of the Flies,'' by William Golding.
   The most frequently assigned books by minority authors are
Lorrainne Hansberry's ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' required in 19
percent of schools, and Richard Wright's ``Black Boy,'' required by
7 percent, the survey found.
   Applebee added, however, that commonly used high school
literature anthologies frequently include works by minority and
female authors.
   The survey appeared to answer conservative critics who have
lately accused schools of watering down curricula and retreating
from the classics. Such charges gained currency in the recent
best-sellers ``The Closing of the American Mind'' by Allan Bloom,
and ``Cultural Literacy,'' by E.D. Hirsch.
   The study also showed, surprisingly, that public, private and
Catholic high schools are assigning nearly identical books, said
Applebee.
   At the 80 Catholic schools surveyed, the top-10 list included
the same books as public schools, but in different order.
``Huckleberry Finn'' ranked first, followed by ``The Scarlet
Letter'' and ``Macbeth.''
   ``Macbeth'' topped the list at 86 private schools surveyed.
Unlike public and Catholic schools, that top-10 list included
Homer's epic poem, ``The Odyssey,'' but omitted ``Of Mice and Men.''
   The report replicated a similar survey 25 years ago by the
Educational Testing Service. Shakespeare dominated the list, as he
does now. ``Romeo and Juliet'' replaced ``Macbeth'' in first place,
apparently boosted by the popularity of the film version.
   ``Silas Marner,'' by George Eliot, was the only book showing a
dramatic change in popularity. The 19th century novel about an old
miser who turns to a more human life through his love of a little
girl ranked third 25 years ago, but dropped off the top-10 list in
the latest survey.
   The survey had a margin of error of 3 points.
