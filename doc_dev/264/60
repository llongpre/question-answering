<P>
At 48, Yves Beauchemin has nurtured a low-grade anxiety over what he regards as 
the ongoing pillage of his native province, Quebec. Coupled with a well-honed 
appreciation for the occasional absurdity of French life in an 
English-dominated continent, this has helped him become his province's 
best-known living novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin is a rarity in French Canada: a writer of such distinct narrative 
power and universal appeal that his books are read around the world. "The 
Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature" has called him "one of the most gifted 
storytellers to emerge in recent years in French-language literature." 
</P>
<P>
In France, where the natives are always finicky about accepting non-native 
writers, few have taken issue with this characterization. Beauchemin's second 
novel, published in 1981 as "Le Matou," sold more than 750,000 copies as a 
French book-of-the month-club offering. 
</P>
<P>
"Le Matou" is the Faustian tale of a young man, Florent Boisonneault, who falls 
prey to a Mephistophelean figure, Egon Ratablavasky. The old man persuades him 
to buy out a popular Montreal restaurant. Florent soon realizes that he has 
been duped. Worse, he learns that the entire city, including his Anglo partner, 
appears to have fallen under the evil Ratablavasky's influence. 
</P>
<P>
Ranking French critic Bernard Pivot called "Le Matou" "a revelation." The book 
later won that country's prestigious Prix du Roman de L'Ete. "Le Matou" has 
since sold 1.2 million copies, in various French editions, throughout the 
French-speaking world. It was adapted in 1985 as a six-part TV miniseries as a 
joint French and Quebecois production. 
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., which has little or no historical affinity for Quebecois 
literature, "Le Matou" was published five years later by Henry Holt &amp; Co. 
in translation as "The Alley Cat." Warmly received by American critics, it sold 
a respectable 40,000 copies in hardcover (a quarter of these sales in English 
Canada), and has since been translated into 15 languages, including Finnish, 
Romanian and, most recently, Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Beauchemin has published a new novel -- the nearly 700-page-long and 
still-to-be-translated "Juliette Pomerleau" -- fans in both French and English 
Canada are betting that he will reach an even wider readership. "Juliette 
Pomerleau," published in March by Quebec-Amerique, sold more than 50,000 copies 
during its first month, and sales have remained steady since. 
</P>
<P>
Critics in Quebec have written that the book, which he defines as "sort of a 
detective novel without a detective or, for that matter, a crime," confirms 
Beauchemin's position as French Canada's master storyteller. One of them 
characterized the book as "another Titanic -- only this one floats." 
</P>
<P>
Like the characters who populate his picaresque novels, Yves Beauchemin has not 
succumbed passively to the inequities and insularity of life in what some have 
described as "Fortress Quebec." There is a sense in his books of the new 
Quebec: a secular would-be republic eager to embrace the capitalism and 
materialism rampant on the continent even as it remains wary of the inexorably 
seductive pull of the English language that dominates it. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in his novels, which have been called Dickensian in their sense of place 
and Balzacian in their depth of character, people are also always making off 
with whatever bits and pieces of Quebec that are not bolted to the ground. In 
"The Alley Cat," for instance, Beauchemin's alter ego witnesses the removal of 
a clock from an historic Gothic church. It is to be installed, he learns, in a 
Connecticut amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"Those Americans," complains a woman onlooker, "they are bloody powerful, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
This perhaps reflects his vision of Americans in Quebec, where Beauchemin has 
lived his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in Clova, a northern Quebec lumber town owned by a New 
York paper company, Beauchemin witnessed the decimation of the province's 
once-plush woodlands. In his view, Canada was a colony of the U.S., and Quebec, 
a colony of Canada. Now, the English in both countries appear intent -- or so 
it seems from where he stands -- upon decimating the province's cultural and 
linguistic viability as well. 
</P>
<P>
As Beauchemin, an avowed independiste, or separatist, sees it, English Canada 
has systematically sapped Quebec of its sovereign potential. Even the federal 
policy of bilingualism, which was adopted during the 1960s to assure the 
equality of French and English as official languages throughout Canada, 
remains, for many Quebecois, a no-win proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I am profoundly convinced," Beauchemin told the Montreal Gazette, "that Quebec 
cannot reach its full potential without attaining independence. That doesn't 
mean I wish all the Anglophones would go to hell." Without independence, 
Beauchemin and others fear Quebec will ultimately disappear linguistically and 
culturally into English North America. "We are," he once said of French Quebec, 
"like a cube of sugar beside a gallon of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin was born in Noranda, a northern mining town near the Ontario border, 
where his grandfather published a newspaper, Le Frontiere. When he was 5, he 
moved with his family to Clova, near Abitibi, 200 miles away, where his father 
worked as a field inspector for the New York-based International Paper Co. 
</P>
<P>
"For a kid," he said, "it was a wonderful place, just tremendous. There were no 
police, no mayor, only the most minimal degree of social organization, and 
there was a lot of space." 
</P>
<P>
If one could endure the seclusion -- the town was fed by a single railway line, 
and medical emergencies necessitated calling in an airplane -- Clova was not 
the worst place for an adult to be, either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there was little of the privation and price gouging one might 
otherwise expect from a company town. The company, said Beauchemin, had a hard 
time getting people to work so far away from the most rudimentary urban 
centers. As a result, there were perks. Beauchemin lived with his brothers and 
sisters in a large two-story house rented, he recalls, for $15 a month. Milk 
was free and meat was cheap, 10 cents a pound for any cut. 
</P>
<P>
Unusual for Quebec in those days, Clova was also lingually integrated. French 
and English children studied together in the same school house. It was there 
that Beauchemin learned the English that has stayed with him, however 
haltingly, to this day. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived harmoniously," he recalled, "because everybody accepted the rules of 
the game. The office jobs went to the English, the physical jobs to the French. 
It couldn't have been otherwise, of course -- French people weren't educated 
enough to hold the other jobs. Until 1960 we didn't even have a ministry of 
education in Quebec." 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin became a voracious reader at an early age. Problems with his left 
eye made him unfit, he said, to play hockey and baseball with the other boys. 
"I wore glasses, and of course the boys called me sissy. I never learned to do 
sports well but I did learn to fight." 
</P>
<P>
His mother had kept her childhood library, and Beauchemin subsisted on French 
imports, packages from his grandfather's substantial library in Abitibi, and 
English-language comic books consumed by his Anglo schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Beauchemin left Clova to attend high school in Joliette, a small 
French town about 60 kilometers northeast of Montreal. He lived in a dormitory, 
but his first year of regimentation was difficult. Eventually, however, 
Beauchemin became enamored of the city, of what he has called the "Balzac 
effect," the richness and diversity of urban living. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, Beauchemin had tried his hand at a novel set in Venice. This quickly 
proved to be beyond his capacities -- he gave it up after four pages. But he 
returned to the craft of writing at 19, completing a novel influenced by 
19th-Century Russian literature. It wasn't terribly accomplished, and has never 
been published, but Beauchemin continues to regard it as an important landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the characteristics of a real writer," he says, "is that they finish 
what they start." 
</P>
<P>
There followed a series of perhaps 50 humorous stories and vignettes cast in 
the manner of Mark Twain and Stephen Leacock. An astute sense of the comic 
remains one of Beauchemin's trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
At 21, Beauchemin entered the University of Montreal, where he obtained a 
three-year degree in French and art history. Quebec had just gone through its 
so-called Quiet Revolution, attended by major educational and social reforms 
and a lessening of the power of the Catholic Church over Quebecois institutions 
and political affairs. While in Montreal, however, he became politicized by the 
realization that although the majority of people living there were French, the 
language of business and power remained English. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating, Beauchemin taught literature at the College Garneau and at 
Universite Laval. During this time, he continued churning out short stories and 
articles, which were published in a variety of local magazines and newspapers. 
Beauchemin ultimately forsook academe, saying that he did not wish to spend his 
days "measuring (Quebec novelist) Gabrielle Roy's soul with a ruler." 
</P>
<P>
He worked in Montreal at a branch of the book publisher Holt, Rinehart &amp; 
Winston, where he became the editor in charge of drama and history. While 
working as a researcher at Radio-Quebec, which he joined in 1969, Beauchemin 
continued to improve his craft. "I loved that job because it was nourishing for 
a novelist. I was always learning something new." 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin says the great Russian novels of the 19th Century, among others, 
inspire his writing. He cites Nikolai Gogol and Charles Dickens as important 
sources for "Le Matou," as well as such 20th-Century Americans as John 
Steinbeck, J. D. Salinger and Ernest Hemingway. "I found in all of them a sense 
of place, of time, and a concrete, pragmatic way of dealing with a story." 
</P>
<P>
"What Quebecois readers want is a good story. That's all. If you can't write a 
good story, they won't read it. 
</P>
<P>
His job, according to critic Francine Pelletier, writing in the Montreal 
Gazette, is "to translate what we like to call here le Quebec profond -- the 
heart and soul of Quebec."
