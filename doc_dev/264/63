<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  E.L. DOCTOROW'S "Billy Bathgate" has rightly been hailed as an American
classic, a colorful evocation of Depression-era New York that borrows equally
from Mark Twain and tabloid accounts of post-Prohibitioncrime. The Disney
(well, Touchstone) version that borrows Doctorow's title and features Dustin
Hoffman as the murderous Arthur "Dutch" Schultz is worth seeing, but it misses
the jocular-yet-appalling tone of the book.;   Indeed, "Billy Bathgate" the
movie (opening today) proves handsome but fractured, respectable but
lethargic, much like Milos Forman's episodic treatment of Doctorow's "Ragtime."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Worse, it showcases Hoffman in a rare one-note performance. His Schultz is
a psycho in fedora and double-breasted suit. He needed to be more: endearing
and childlike as well as scary.;   Whatever sets "Billy Bathgate" apart as a
book (its stream-of-consciousness eloquence, its boy's-eye-view braggadocio,
its flavorful portrait of the Bronx, circa 1935) appears to have been beyond
the usually capable Robert Benton, whose past triumphs have included "Kramer
vs. Kramer" (also with Hoffman) and "Places in the Heart.";   Benton is
nothing if not a painstaking craftsman, and that shows here. "Billy Bathgate,"
photographed by the great Nestor Almendros and scripted by Tom Stoppard, looks
great. What it lacks is energy, the ohmygosh giddiness of the novel.
Doctorow's hero comes on as an eager apprentice smitten by excitement and the
good life. He's a cocky innocent/opportunist, a Huck Finn on an asphalt river
that, mid-voyage, turns blood red.;   At heart, the book is about the American
dream and its grim underside and consequences. Billy can't believe his good
fortune, when, at 15, he falls in with the Dutchman's gang. Luck, of course,
has little to do with it. Billy is drawn to Schultz like a crow to carrion.
Schultz is the dark side of every boyhood adventure.;   Some of this has found
its way into the movie. On a superficial level, Benton (who made his
direc-REVIEW; torial debut with "Good Company," a Wild West version of this
same story) has dramatized that eternal battle between ambition and
responsibility, getting it all and paying for it all. Loren Dean as Billy is
something of a punk and a scoundrel. You can almost hear his mind clicking as
he files away this or that piece of potentially incriminating information.;  
But just as Hoffman's Schultz is all Napoleonic bluster and no charm, Dean's
Billy is too much the all-American Tom Swift on a summer fling. Doctorow's
Billy is much savvier, much easier to dislike. He's capable of filching a
dying man's last meal (an act that didn't make its way to the screen).;   Like
the book, the movie opens on a tugboat, with Schultz exacting cold-hearted --
and, as it turns out, unnecessary -- revenge on the natty killer Bo Weinberg
(Bruce Willis). From here we flash back to Billy's first meeting with Schultz
and Billy's cunning infiltration of the numbers racket. Then, it's back to the
tugboat and the real start of the story, which will be about Dutch's
tax-evasion problems and Bo's rich, heartless girlfriend, Drew (Nicole Kidman
of "Days of Thunder").;   Drew, who takes up with Schultz but is attracted to
Billy, is as much a schemer and manipulator as the two men in her life. Her
saving grace and potential undoing: She doesn't hide her deceit.;   The second
half of this mobster chronicle could have been played for belly-laughs. It
takes place in upstate New York, where Schultz and his men re-locate to play
"plain folk" and buy an "impartial" jury. The idea of gangsters on holiday has
been milked for humor before, by Frank Capra and Damon Runyon, among others.
Benton plays the country sojourn straight (even a baptism reminiscent of "The
Godfather") and misses several opportunities for black humor.;   "Billy
Bathgate" snaps momentarily to life when Billy and Drew begin their foolhardy
Saratoga fling and Schultz's torpedoes close in for the kill. It's here that
Benton shows his flair for Hitchcockian suspense, cross-cutting to prolong our
-- and Billy's -- misery.;   Too bad there aren't more such interludes.
Overall, "Billy Bathgate" is a dour, awkwardly structured hint of a terrific
novel. It has more integrity, mind you, than Brian DePalma's lurid and
misshapen "The Untouchables," thanks mainly to dead-on supporting turns by
Steve Buscemi and especially Steven Hill as Schultz's accountant/conscience.
But like poor Bo, it's anchored in quick-drying cement from the start and can
never squirm to life as a picaresque "Little Caesar."; Billy Bathgate;
