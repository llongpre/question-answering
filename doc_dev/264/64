   The first book arrived in this arctic
nation 500 years ago and Finns apparently have decided reading is an
ideal way to spend long, dark winters that keep them indoors most of
the time.
   ``No other country places such emphasis on literature,'' said
Marja-Leena Rautalin of the Finnish Literature Society. ``It's
obvious everywhere you look. Foreign writers and critics who visit
us are constantly surprised.''
   Celebrations pegged to the arrival in 1488 of a volume written in
Latin and printed for the Finns in Germany were held throughout 1988
and into January.
   She said the extent of the anniversary celebrations reflected
widespread interest: ``It wasn't just another highbrow cultural
event. It also worked at the grass-roots level.''
   Four of five adults in Finland read a daily newspaper. More than
83 million books are borrowed annually from 20,000 public libraries
in a nation of fewer than 5 five million people.
   The government subsidizes writers and several literary prizes are
awarded each year. The Finlandia Prize, the largest, is worth the
equivalent of $23,500.
   Nearly 9,000 books are published each year, which the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization says is the most
in the world per capita. UNESCO statistics for 1986 put the number
of titles per 10,000 inhabitants at 17.7, compared with 1.2 in the
United States.
   About half the books published are translations, most from
English.
   Although the numbers are impressive, poet and social critic Paavo
Haavikko worries about timidity in publishing and the national
penchant for concensus.
   Haavikko, who won the 1984 Neustadt Literature Award from the
University of Oklahoma, published an eight-poem series in a leading
magazine in December defining the political climate in Finland as
``corrupt.''
   In an interview, Haavikko said: ``It's not 500 years of the
Finnish book that has been celebrated, but a couple of hundred years
of a closed and stagnant publishing trade.
   ``Yes, we could say the publishing trade is doing okay, but that
does not necessarily mean we can print what we want. There is an
unwritten agreement to keep one's mouth shut, and self-censorship
prevails in this consensus country.''
   During the observance, a new magazine called The Reader appeared,
promoting literature and reading. Ms. Rautalin said schools and
kindergartens arranged programs around the theme and companies held
writing competitions.
   An exhibition at the National Museum in Helsinki was to have
closed at the end of 1988, but drew record crowds and was extended.
   ``We have had some 40,000 visitors during the four months of the
exhibition,'' curator Kirsti Melanko said.
   Finland's first book was the ``Missale Aboense,'' in Latin and
named for Abo, a southwestern city now called Turku.
   Turku, the provincial capital when Finland was part of Sweden,
was the focus of the 500th anniversary celebrations. Plays and
celebrations were held at its 14th-century castle and there were
special services at Turku Cathedral.
   Except for Latin publications for church use, most of the
earliest books were in Swedish. The first Finnish primer appeared in
1543 and a Finnish prayer book was issued the next year.
   Finnish publishing was small-scale for centuries, consisting
mainly of scholarly and religious works. By the early 19th century
only 18,000 works had been printed, just 2,500 of them in Finnish.
   That number of new titles now arrives at the main Helsinki
University Library every two months.
   Efforts began in the early 1800s to create a national culture and
Finnish-language literature.
   J.V. Snellman, a statesman and politicial philosopher, and Elias
Lonnrot, a physician and folk historian, founded the Finnish
Literature Society in 1831.
   Lonnrot roamed the marshes and forests of Karelia, an eastern
region now partially in the Soviet Union, setting down its myths and
folk songs.
   The result was The Kalevala, his epic work, which was published
in 1835 and had a major influence on Finnish music and arts.
Sibelius drew on it for his symphony ``Finlandia,'' and other
artists used its ideas and themes.
   Longfellow employed the meter of Kalevala verse in ``The Song of
Hiawatha,'' published in 1855. The Kalevala is compulsory reading in
Finnish schools.
