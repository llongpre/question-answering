BOOKS AND AUTHORS: RAY BRADBURY, HIS WORDS ADORN LIBRARY POSTER

The setting is Ray Bradbury's cluttered basement office in his Cheviot Hills 
home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There, looking up from his desk as if caught in mid-sentence, is the 
white-maned literary lion in his natural habitat: surrounded by a lifetime's 
worth of books and memorabilia. Displayed prominently in the foreground is a 
copy of Bradbury's latest book, "Death Is a Lonely Business," and a library 
card. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely the point of the Orange County Public Library's full-color 
poster featuring the prolific science fiction writer. 
</P>
<P>
"Libraries are my university. I am their eternal graduate," Bradbury is quoted 
as saying at the top of the poster, which celebrates the Orange County Public 
Library as "My Kind of Place." 
</P>
<P>
The limited edition poster was released this week in conjunction with National 
Library Week. It is available, for free, at all 27 Orange County branch 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury is the fourth in a series of authors selected annually to appear on 
the library's poster. Previously honored authors are T. Jefferson Parker of 
Laguna Beach, Donald Stanwood of Santa Ana and Maxine O'Callaghan of Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
With Bradbury, the library obviously has broken the tradition of featuring 
home-grown authors. 
</P>
<P>
"He is certainly one of the most renowned authors of our time and, while 
normally in the past we've always done Orange County authors, we had the 
opportunity to do Ray Bradbury . . . and he's a tremendous supporter of 
libraries," said Cheryl Pruett, community relations coordinator for the Orange 
County Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett, a Bradbury fan, went along for the photo shoot in Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bigger than it appears," she said. "He opens the door and you are kind of 
taken aback. It's filled. No matter where you look you see something new and 
fascinating -- anything from Godzilla to a jar of what looks like formaldehyde 
with something strange floating in it. There are things hanging from the 
ceiling and masks and toys and world globes. . . . It's fascinating. And his 
typewriter is in the middle of all this and this is where he creates." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury was unavailable for comment this week, but fans will have an 
opportunity in May to find out how he likes being the library's latest poster 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
On May 7 the Friends of the Library Foundation will host "An Afternoon With Ray 
Bradbury" from 2 to 4 p.m. at Heritage Park Regional Library, 14361 Yale Ave., 
Irvine. Posters will be given away and copies of Bradbury books will be 
available for purchase during an autograph session with the author of 
"Fahrenheit 451" and "The Martian Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
Admission is a $20 donation for a Friends of the Library Foundation Membership. 
(The single $20 admission fee covers couples and families). The admission fee 
for current members of local Friends of the Library organizations is $10.
