<LEADPARA>  When Mark Twain said, "The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San
Francisco," he was talking about the city's notoriously foggy weather.;    Or
maybe he didn't say it at all.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So claim scholars at the Mark Twain Papers at the University of California,
Berkeley, one of the world's largest collections of Twain documents.;    For
years, researchers here have been hunting for records proving Twain said such
oft-repeated quips as, "When I feel the urge to exercise, I lie down until it
passes away.";    But so far, they have only come up with a long list of what
Twain might not have said.;    "We can't say for certain that he did not say .
. . these. But we cannot find the citations . . . And we've looked," said
editor Kenneth Sanderson.;    Other questionable Twain sayings include:;   
"Don't go to sleep, so many people die there," "I became a newspaperman. I
hated to do it, but I couldn't find honest employment," and "There's nothing
so annoying as to have two people go right on talking when you're
interrupting.";    But Twain did live up to the wittiness that is so often
attributed to him. He did once write about a rumor regarding his death.;   
"James Ross Clemens, a cousin of mine, was seriously ill two or three weeks
ago, in London, but is well now. The report of my death was an exaggeration,"
Twain wrote.;    UC-Berkeley history Professor Gunther Barth said the false
Twain attributions stem from the desire to give the sayings credibility.;   
"There is a deep humanity that the man still radiates. There are only a few
figures like that," Barth said.;    And as Twain might or might not have said:
"Better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove
all doubt."  </TEXT>
