<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE adage "good things come in small packages" is certainly borne out by
Disney's new "Paradise" (opening today). Directed and written by Mary Agnes
Donoghue, with appropriately testy performances by Melanie Griffith and Don
Johnson as an estranged Southern couple, this little heart-tugger should be a
real hit with those who carp, "They don't make movies like they used to.";  
At an advance screening, there was nary a dry eye in the theater.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And guess what? The tears, for a change, were come by honestly -- through
character development.;   "Paradise" is richer and more satisfying than "On
Golden Pond." This kind of hard-nosed sob picture harkens back to some of the
Disney classics of yore, including "Ol' Yeller" and "Pollyanna.";   Elijah
Wood, soon to be seen in "Radio Flyer," stars as 10-year-old Willard Young.
Willard is a bright, lonely youngster who withdraws still further when his
pregnant, suddenly single mother (Eve Gordon) ships him off to her best friend
in the coastal town of Paradise.;   It's for the best, Willard's mother
assures him. Little does either know that ward-chaperon roles will be reversed
over the summer. Willard the sensitive, citified waif will act as a conduit
for long-stifled emotions. His presence will provide hope to two people
immobilized by grief and guilt.;   Griffith and Johnson, who know all about
long-shot reconciliations, play Lily and Ben Reed, Willard'sinitially
reluctant hosts. Ben, who runs a shrimp boat, broods over baseball and beer
during his off hours. To Willard, he seems distant and unaccountably stern. As
for Lily, she's pleasant enough, but -- like Tippi Hedren in Alfred
Hitchcock's "Marnie" -- has this thing about being touched, especially by her
in-name-only husband. She is, however, capable of being nice to her young
visitor, and this confuses things even more.;   Of course every Tom Sawyer
must have his Huckleberry -- or Harriet -- Finn. Willard's is 9-year-old
neighbor Billie Pike (the positively delightful Thora Birch). Billie, also
fatherless, is desperate to be liked. Which is why she grandstands shamelessly
and introduces the out-of-towner to her favorite swimming hole, the "witch"
across the way (actually a prim naturalist played by Louise Latham) and the
lakeside watch tower where she plays a special game of "chicken.";   Everyone
is looking for affection in "Paradise" -- the seemingly abandoned Willard, the
"broken inside" Lily, the tomboyish Billie, Billie's always-on-the-make
waitress mom (the wonderfully gawky Sheila McCarthy of "I Heard the Mermaids
Singing").;   And how do they find it? The usual ways -- by dropping their
defenses and inching out on that brittle branch called life. "I'm just sick of
being afraid," Lily says with a sigh when she realizes things can't get much
worse.;   There are few surprises in "Paradise," taken from the French hit "Le
Grand Chemin." But that's OK. Writer-director Donoghue has conceived her first
film as a delicate tone poem. Her South Carolina wetlands are redolent of
promise and mystery. It makes perfect sense that her youngsters pass much of
the summer nestled in the crooks of gnarled, moss-covered trees.;   Not since
Robert Mulligan scored with "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Summer of '42" has a
child's perspective been sustained so capably.;   For "Paradise" to work, we
must believe in Lily and Ben's potential for hostility and hurt. We have to
share Willard's unease whenever husband and wife wander into the same room and
work hard to ignore one another. We have to ache for their reconciliation.
Griffith and Johnson, obviously calling upon something very personal, make
this happen. We, like Willard, go from resenting the Reeds to pitying them, to
cheering them on. Their reawakening is at the heart of this very special
movie, and Griffith and Johnson make the voyage at once realistic and
gloriously upbeat.;   The best scenes, however, belong to the children. Under
Donoghue's tutelage, Wood and Birch are allowed to behave like real kids -- to
be nervy, bratty and vulnerable. Their camaraderie lacks pretense. It's the
kind of unconditional love that adults outgrow, and must someday retrieve if
they're to move on.;   "Paradise" is well-titled -- it's about an idyllic
place devoted to second chances.; Paradise; (star)(star)(star)(star); Rated:
