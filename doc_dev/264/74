<TEXT>     (check) Walt Whitman, beloved champion of the common man, wrote in 1858,
"Who believes that the Whites and Blacks can ever amalgamate in America? Or
who wishes it to happen? Nature has set an impassable seal against it.
Besides, is not America for the Whites? And is it not better so?";    (check)
Mark Twain, yet another b.c. of the c.m., wrote from South Africa in 1896
(long after the publication of all his best-known books) to his newlywed
millionaire friend Henry Rogers and jokingly promised Rogers a list of lavish
wedding gifts, culminating with a "herd of niggers.";    Alas, all three are
true.;    Alas, also, all three are part of a confusing pattern in American
intellectual life, in which heroes of old are figuratively exhumed and
re-interrogated about their politics and prejudices.;    Last year, the
literary world debated the significance of disparaging remarks about Jews
(and, to a lesser extent, blacks) in the private diaries of H.L. Mencken. In
1989, two years after the death of Joseph Campbell, a debate broke out --
first in the pages of the New York Review of Books and later spilling over
into such disparate journals as Utne Reader and People magazine -- about
whether the mythology expert was, in private, an anti-Semite.;    The tale
about Rogers resurfaced in "Parting the Waters," Taylor Branch's 1988 book
about the American civil rights movement. It is tough to know what to make of
it. Most of the time, Rogers (currently enjoying a nostalgia boom courtesy of
a Tony Award-winning Broadway revue about him) was a pretty noisy voice for
equal consideration of the rights and plights of black Americans.;    More
typical of Rogers is this passage from his newspaper column during the 1927
Mississippi flood: "When you talk about poor people that have been hit by this
flood, look at the thousands and thousands of Negroes that never did have
much, but now it's washed away. You don't want to forget that water is just as
high up on them as it is if they were white.";    On the other hand, according
to one of his biographers, Rogers often expressed admiration for "The Birth of
a Nation," D.W. Griffith's silent movie in which the Ku Klux Klansmen are the
good guys.;    Whitman is no less puzzling. His comments on blacks and whites,
originally published in the Brooklyn Daily Times, were exhumed in the July 1
issue of The New Yorker. They were written three years after the first
publication of "Leaves of Grass," which spoke sympathetically about a runaway
slave and admiringly (even lovingly) of a black dray-driver.;    Twain is a
human shuttlecock in this debate, batted across the net from racism to
tolerance and back again as the result of decades of scholarship about him.
This year's book is "The Man Who Was Mark Twain" (Yale University Press;
$27.50) by Guy Cardwell, who reassembles the argument that Twain was, in many
ways, a racist.;    Cardwell argues that even in his later years, Twain never
outgrew his idea that blacks "are at best simple, smiling, trusting, loyal and
superstitious . . . even in maturity they live in a state of arrested
childhood and are dependent on whites for guidance.";    Each of those writers
and thinkers is like a stalk of celery with a spot of mold on it. Is the whole
thing tainted, or can we cut away the blight and still find a lot to nourish
us?;    "We have to learn to deal with these challenges of reading," says
James Miller, professor of English and American Studies at Trinity College in
Hartford, Conn.;    Each of the men -- Rogers, Whitman, Twain, Mencken and
Campbell -- has a significant reputation as a social critic who challenged
Americans to behave more broad-mindedly and, to use today's political code
word, inclusively. How could they also be bigots?;    Miller deplores the
notion that "somehow writers we revere or have been taught to revere should
somehow be more free of the contradictions that run through the society at
large.";    He urges his students to face those contradictions and maintain a
state of "constant negotiation" with the writer's values.;    Sheldon L.
Richman, now a fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.,
was one of several commentators to write a defense (in the summer 1990 issue
of the American Scholar) of Mencken against charges of anti-Semitism.;   
Richman does not believe that putting historical figures on trial for their
prejudices is necessarily healthy, inasmuch as a writer living in the 1880s
cannot be expected to embrace the political correctness of the 1990s.;    "It
seems like a form of ex post facto law," he says. "It's like passing a law and
then trying people for breaking the law before it existed.";    To make it
worse, Richman says, the defendant is not around to speak for himself, and the
prosecutor is often out to make a name for himself by tearing down a social
hero. Cardwell says Twain's racism was, at least in part, a function of the
time he lived in.;    "Our conceptions of racism are very different from his,"
Cardwell says. "Calling him by our standards a racist is relatively
anachronistic.";    One of the intellectual fads of the moment is, in fact,
"the new historicism," which argues that it's important to consider the
historical context in which any work was written and published.;   
Historicism may give defenders of Twain, Mencken and others a little room to
plea-bargain. "It's got to be a defense -- that people were more ignorant
about things then," says Wellesley College humanities professor Mary R.
Lefkowitz.;    But not an ironclad defense, Trinity's Miller says. Miller says
calling Twain "a product of his times" makes the false assumption that America
had a "universal, monolithic" set of values at that moment.;    "How do you
define the climate of the times?" he says. "In any given moment in a society,
there's always a debate going on.";    Cardwell agrees that Twain had the
opportunity to be better than the worst instincts of his times. But he argues
for a kind of sliding scale. Mencken, born 45 years after Twain, had exposure
to even more enlightened thinking.;    Miller says their work should be
taught, but with a eye to the contradictions in it.;    Wellesley's Lefkowitz
suggests distinguishing between what is in the work and what was in the person
behind it.;    She wrote, also in the American Scholar, an essay about
Campbell arguing that his published work contains no traces of the
anti-Semitism that apparently ran through his private life. (On the other
hand, Lefkowitz continued, Campbell's published interpretations of myth "tend
to strip women of all but their most elemental sexual characteristics, and to
emphasize their role as brides and mothers.");    The biggest beneficiary of
Lefkowitz's point of view would be Mencken, who confined most of his bigotry
to his private diaries. In his published work, he was usually an eloquent
spokesman for Jewish causes, and the Jews of his day viewed him as a friend
and ally.;    Miller says the judgments we make about Twain, Mencken, Rogers,
Whitman and the others are important, but it's never as simple as writing one
of them off as a racist.;    "There's something intractable about literary
history," he says. "After you've been through the trial and they've had their
day in court and you find them guilty, when the dust settles, they're still
sitting there."  </TEXT>
