   Leonard and Julie Laczkowski's wedding day was
all wet, and so were some of the guests.
   After a heavy rain storm, Laczkowski awoke Saturday, his wedding
day, to find his father's front yard under 3 feet of water.
   Luckily, his father had a 12-foot rowboat, so Laczkowski kept
his tuxedo dry by rowing about 175 feet to a waiting limousine.
   The real fun began after the wedding when about 125 guests
returned to the house for a reception, Laczkowski said.
   ``Some of them cut through the neighbors' yards, where it was
drier, or else they took the rowboat trip,'' he said.
   A few people decided to drive through the water to the area
where the reception was held, he said. ``But those that did ended
up with water in their back seats,'' he said.
   ``My mother's car died trying to make it through, and then she
made the mistake of opening the door. That's when the water came.''
Her gown was ruined, he said.
   Laczkowski said the water didn't put much of a damper on the
celebration.
   ``By the time we all got up here, it was kind of funny. I don't
think too many of them ever went to a wedding where the groom
pushed them across in a boat,'' he said. ``I was pushing the boat
in a tuxedo with my pants rolled up. I looked like Huckleberry
Finn.''
