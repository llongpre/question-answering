   Although Mark Twain's humor is a chief
reason for his enduring popularity, several scholars meeting to
commemorate one of the author's least humorous novels said Twain's
brooding side will also help keep him relevant to future
generations.
   ``I think people are figuring out that they can't some day say,
`Well, Mark Twain, he's out of it. He was just a mindless
optimist,''' said Louis Budd, a Duke University professor and
editor of the ``Journal of American Literature.''
   ``People do know there was a darker and more irreverent side to
Mark Twain,'' Budd said.
   Budd was among about 150 literary scholars and Twain fans
attending a three-day conference sponsored by Elmira College's
Center for Mark Twain Studies at Quarry Farm to mark the 100th
anniversary of the publication of ``A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur's Court.''
   The conference, held Thursday, Friday and Saturday in the city
where Twain is buried, showed how popular the author remains 79
years after his death.
   ``Only a few years ago, academic types like myself were polled
on who was the greatest American writer and Mark Twain and Walt
Whitman came out No. 1,'' said Everett Emerson, a University of
North Carolina professor and Twain biographer.
   ``Now, in fact, I've almost never known an ordinary person who's
read a whole lot of Walt Whitman,'' he said. ``But Twain is
recognized by professors as a very great writer at the same time
ordinary people do, too. Twain's different from any other American
writer because he's liked by ordinary people.''
   Indeed, debates continued throughout the conference about the
meaning and significance of ``A Connecticut Yankee'' as if the
novel had appeared in 1989 instead of 1889.
   The novel concerns an imaginary trip to 6th-century England by
Hank Morgan, a Connecticut factory mechanic who uses his knowledge
of electricity and other ``modern'' technology to seize control of
the court.
   While the first third of the book is mostly a farce about the
customs of medieval England and the inconveniences of living in
that age, the novel takes on a more ominous tone in its final
two-thirds. It ends with a bloody battle in which thousands of
knights are slaughtered with the help of such 19th century
refinements as electricity and Gatling guns.
   Frederick Crews, a University of California at Berkeley
professor, said the ending of the book ``stuns and chills us.''
   ``Only a few critics have been able to talk themselves out of
the sense that something has gone terribly wrong, not only with the
book but also with Twain,'' he told conference participants.
   Many critics have seen the darkness of the latter part of ``A
Connecticut Yankee'' as presaging the final two troubled decades of
Twain's own life, when a series of financial and personal setbacks
prompted a string of bitter, misanthropic writings. Budd referred
to this stage of the author's life as the ``late, atheistic,
outrageous Twain.''
   Still, Crews and most other experts at the conference agreed
that many passages in ``A Connecticut Yankee'' exhibit the kind of
homespun wit and humor Twain became famous for in ``The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn'' and other books.
   ``It has the makings of a classic,'' he said of ``A Connecticut
Yankee.''
   According to Emerson, Twain's reputation has profited from the
added attention the author has received from centennial
celebrations of ``Huckleberry Finn'' in 1985 and ``A Connecticut
Yankee'' this year.
   ``You must know the worst thing that could happen to a writer is
to be forgotten,'' he said. ``No one has forgotten this guy.''
