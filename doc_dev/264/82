<TEXT>
<P>
Seth Morgan is back at his old place of employment, a Bourbon Street strip 
joint that's as black as a hole in the universe, save the dingy neon galaxies 
of liquor signs and revolving disco lights. On a red tongue of a stage, just 
inches from the nearest patrons, a young woman in a G-string writhes in the 
undulating illumination. From the surrounding darkness, eyes are fixed on her 
body like suction cups. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan looks on matter-of-factly. Now 41, he's worked in the flesh trades for 
years, turning his hand to pimping, drug-dealing and armed robbery. Along the 
way he was Janis Joplin's lover and a fellow inmate of "Charlie" Manson at 
Vacaville state prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan's life as a thug has a twist. The son of Frederick Morgan, founder 
of the venerable literary journal, the Hudson Review, and scion of an old-line 
New York family, he is the quintessential rich kid gone bad: an ex-con, 
ex-addict, ex-alcoholic, now back from the netherworld on the road to 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
He has brought with him a first novel, "Homeboy," based on his experiences in 
San Francisco's Tenderloin district in the 1970s and his three years in 
Vacaville on a five-to-life sentence for armed robbery. Careening through the 
underbelly of American life, the narrative focuses on the autobiographically 
drawn protagonist, Joe Speaker, a barker/pimp at a low-life dive, and his 
"squeeze," Kitty Litter, a stripper-prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
To be published in May by Random House, the book has a fast-track jailhouse 
beat that is winning early attention in publishing circles. "It's the real 
thing," confirms an editor who worked on the manuscript. Morgan's agent, Gloria 
Loomis, adds more portentously, "Seth isn't all the way out of the woods." 
</P>
<P>
On a spring evening, when the magnolias are in bloom on the lawns of the city's 
antebellum homes, Morgan tramps down Bourbon Street, revisiting his old French 
Quarter haunts. He is still a recognized face on the street. Dope peddlers 
whisper their wares in his ear; prostitutes, slipping off to the shadows, greet 
him by name. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit town three years ago, Morgan worked as a barker at the strip joint 
he now visits, drawing in tourists and convention crowds with a slick patter of 
promises. His then-girlfriend, a prostitute who turned tricks to pay their way 
from San Francisco, was a stripper there. (He salutes her: "a good whore, a 
real race horse.") 
</P>
<P>
Morgan came to New Orleans intent on drinking himself to death. "I ran out of 
highway," he says. "I ran out of space to run away from myself." Instead, he 
wrote "Homeboy," appropriately choosing a literary salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Raised on Park Avenue, in an apartment filled with rare books, Morgan wandered 
among get-togethers of such literary pals of his father's as T.S. Eliot, Robert 
Lowell and Anthony Burgess. He read Latin at St. Bernard's, a tony Manhattan 
elementary school, and left on cue to prep at Hotchkiss in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
But early on, a son's fears and an adolescent's perception of social-register 
hypocrisy lethally combined, turning the young aristocrat into a budding 
criminal. Sexual liaisons with town girls and the extortion of school money 
from fellow students got him sacked from Hotchkiss, while participation in 
group sex with the daughter of a prominent businessman earned his subsequent 
ouster from the American School in Lugano, Switzerland. After a Holden 
Caulfield-style binge through Manhattan and an alcoholic stint in Mexico, 
Morgan was accepted at UC Berkeley with a sophomore standing in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Here he graduated from liquor and marijuana to cocaine and heroin, running a 
drug shuttle to the East Coast and becoming enmeshed with his most famous 
client, Janis Joplin. He rode his Harley-Davidson out to her Marin County house 
to peddle a gram of cocaine and soon after moved in as her lover. Morgan 
recalls the singer as a "simple girl with home values" who today would be 
reading something on the order of Tom Clancey's "The Hunt for Red October." 
"She wanted us to get married on a cruise ship," he says, adding that the last 
call before her death was to city hall inquiring about a marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
"We had fun sex," recalls Morgan, who found himself to be considered a "status" 
lover. "Everybody wanted to know what Janis Joplin saw in me." A full-fledged 
heroin addict by then, Morgan dropped out of Berkeley in his senior year and 
says he joined up with the most beautiful, fatal woman he could find -- Clint 
Eastwood's "squeeze." 
</P>
<P>
The couple married to get cash wedding presents to support their heroin 
addiction. It was Morgan's second round of matrimonial vows; the first 
marriage, annulled after six months, was to a young woman who was paralyzed in 
a drunken crash on his motorcycle. "I married her to keep her from suing me," 
he says, adding with a burst of hoarse laughter: "She sued me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
With his second wife, he descended into the Orphean depths of the Tenderloin. 
Working as a barker and pimping for the strippers-cum-prostitutes, he would 
save the wealthier customers for his spouse. 
</P>
<P>
"This didn't cause any problem," he says. "Knowing she'd just made love over 
the course of the evening didn't bother me one way or another when I made love 
to her." 
</P>
<P>
Partners in crime, the couple started hustling drug money by snatching purses 
from elderly women and playing out the con act known as "the Murphy." "She'd 
pick up a trick and take'm to a hotel room," Morgan says of his wife. "She'd go 
to the bathroom and drop the keys out of the window. Then I'd come in and 
strong-arm the guy when he was naked." 
</P>
<P>
From there it was an easy step to emptying cash registers at gun-point, and, on 
a day in 1977 when his luck ran out, to a cell in Vacaville prison. In plea 
bargaining with the district attorney, Morgan says he took the rap for full 
sentencing, allowing his wife to get off with a stint in a half-way house. She 
skipped out six months later, and, according to the Vacaville grapevine, Morgan 
says, she picked up with a murderer fresh out of Folsom, shot-gunning their old 
drug connection. "He was cold-blooded himself, but he didn't need killing," 
says Morgan, who divorced his wife while still in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Vacaville, some of the company was no better. Morgan saw "the cold fire" 
in killers' eyes and was on speaking terms with mass murderer Manson. He 
remembers Manson as "a dim-witted, ineffectual guy," who, in his loneliness, 
would send cigarettes to new inmates via cockroach couriers tied to a thread. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, after a life of hustling, Morgan found prison offered a quiet, 
constructive time. "It was like an ashram," he says. After swabbing maximum 
security cells on Saturday mornings, he would take his radio out to the prison 
yard and listen to the Metropolitan Opera's broadcast. He took voluminous notes 
on prison life and won a writing award from the PEN literary association for a 
story about the last days of Janis Joplin. One "sentimental Christmas," he 
re-established contact with his father after a hiatus of several years. "He 
wrote back and told me he loved me," Morgan says. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan still wasn't ready for the straight-and-narrow. No sooner was he 
back out on the street in 1980 than he was back at his old barker's job in the 
Tenderloin. Soon he was also hooked up with a fan infatuated with his PEN award 
and who had been doing time for drug sales in Georgia. Sending her plane fare 
to the West Coast, he set her up as a stripper, then proceeded to become a 
"knock-down" alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, he and another prostitute began what he calls "a horrific 
hegira" across the country. "She would turn tricks to get me a room and booze. 
We would go from town to town, smashing up motels, getting warrants, going to 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
By the time they reached New Orleans, Morgan was spiritually anesthetized. "I 
made a choice to die or write," he says, finishing his life's narration. "It 
sounds like a B-movie cliche. But I've lived life in a lethal context so long 
that it's true yet trite." 
</P>
<P>
He also sees writing as a sort of moral expurgation. "I hope that if any of my 
victims read 'Homeboy,' they will feel I have atoned for the wrong I've done 
them." And he has worked out an analysis of cause that centers on his 
now-deceased alcoholic mother (his father has since remarried twice). It was 
her diminished maternal affection, he says, that left both him and an older 
brother with a fatal sense of abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
While his brother committed suicide, vaulting from the Oakland Bay Bridge while 
a student at Stanford, Morgan adopted a sociopath's behavior ("I can con the 
paint off the wall," he says), honing skills of deceit and manipulation aimed 
principally at women. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'd do under the influence of cocaine is plan the strategic degradation 
of women," he concedes. "I wouldn't touch a woman unless I wanted sex." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to work out his feelings in a second book, pondering the substantial 
consequence: "If I allow a woman to love me, then I accept the world." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he laughs benignly at offers by new publishing pals to fix him up 
with a nice Ivy League graduate: He still feels more comfortable in the company 
of whores. 
</P>
<P>
But their incursions into his life are becoming more controlled (the last, he 
says, "was a pretty straight chick"), and his need to satiate his writing 
addiction has become his overriding concern. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Fortress Morgan," he declares, waving at the house he has purchased. 
It is a neglected example of Greek Revival architecture, filled with a pastiche 
of curbside furniture along with red satin chairs and Classical garden 
statuary, inherited from his grandmother's Palm Beach residence. 
</P>
<P>
It is a household constructed on the camaraderie of men: a recovering 
adolescent drug addict, whose mother was one of Morgan's bed-mates, and a 
homeless man who does chores around the place in exchange for room and board. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan rules over this family like a parental potentate, alternately ranting at 
the boy for staying out late, and, in a habit learned from his father, reading 
him bedtime passages from "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." 
</P>
<P>
On an afternoon's outing, he rummages through antique shops, buying a regulator 
clock for his office and even considering acquiring a set of rare books. He 
looks at a pair of cowboy boots, albeit at a sex paraphernalia shop, and buys 
fresh fruit and vegetables for his cook at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
At outdoor market stalls in the French Quarter, he picks up a Soviet Army watch 
for his ward. "To teach him to come home on time," he declares. He admires it 
as he draws on a soda in a nearby bar, and only later, when he is half-way down 
the block, does he discover the watch is missing. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the bar, he waves a $5 bill as reward for the $15 purchase, but there 
are no takers. Charging down the street like a wounded bull, he allows that, 
sure, he once would have stolen the watch in a flash. "But for $5, I would have 
given it back."
