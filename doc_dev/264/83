<LEADPARA>  From our spies in high literature:;   On Friday afternoon, while taking a
stand in the great dangling modifier brouhaha, comparisons to Mark Twain and
Herman Melville arose, and Norman Mailer defended sentences like this one.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mailer maintains the grammatical no-no he committed in the opening sentence
of his 1,307-page novel, "Harlot's Ghost," is written just the way he wanted
it:;   "On a late winter evening in 1983, while driving through fog along the
Maine coast, recollections of old campfires began to drift into the March
mist, and I thought of the Algonquin tribe who dwelt near Bangor a thousand
years ago.";   As constructed, the sentence can be read as saying that
recollections, not a person, are driving a car.;   Jason Epstein, vice
president of Random House, the book's publisher, said the sentence had been
marked for change, but must have slipped past a copy editor. Epstein already
has assured reporters that future editions of the book will correct it.;   Not
so, Mailer declared.;   "The dangling modifier in the first sentence of
'Harlot's Ghost' was my decision, repeated several times over several months,
to keep the sentence intact.;   "I like the rhythm as it stands. I could not
find a better one by fixing the sentence grammatically. For that matter, the
meaning is clear. We often live in recollections while driving a car; it can
even seem as if the recollections are steering the vehicle.;   "Dangling
participles can offend a few readers intensely but the damage caused might add
up to less than the rupture occasioned by straightening out the grammar and
wrecking the good mood. I hope I learned a long time ago from Melville, Mark
Twain, and Faulkner among others that syntax is what you obey until there is
some better reason to ignore it. Future editions will appear with the sentence
unchanged.";   We suspect there will be more on this story anon.  </TEXT>
