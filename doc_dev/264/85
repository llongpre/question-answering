   When the temperature drops in this
southwest Michigan town, townsfolk see red. Red flannel, that is.
   This is the home of those 1880s-style, fire-engine-red long johns
with the button drop seats, as well as red flannel granny gowns with
matching dust caps and hardy red flannel lumberjack shirts.
   And residents aren't shy about their colorful claim to fame.
   Signs along the highway leading to this former logging town,
population 2,615, proclaim Cedar Springs ``Red Flannel Capital of
the World.''
   Red plywood long johns hang from the lampposts on Main Street.
There's the Red Flannel Insurance Center, the Red Flannel Car Wash,
and at the neighborhood tavern, you can get a Red Flannel cocktail _
vodka and cranberry juice. Up until a few weeks ago, you could play
a game of billiards there on a red flannel-topped pool table.
   In a warehouse a few blocks away, seamstresses piece together
bolts of red flannel and the polyester-cotton knit blend of which
the long johns are made.
   ``We think we're selling warmth across the board, not just the
warmth of the garments, but the warmth of the company, of the town''
says Charles Foley, president of The Red Flannel Factory.
   Red flannel is to this town's heritage what automobiles are to
Detroit.
   ``In school, the kids do cutouts of red flannels,'' said vice
president Mike Huckleberry, a Cedar Springs native. ``Almost
everyone in town feels a part of The Red Flannel Factory.''
   It began in 1936, when, during a brutal blizzard, a New York
feature writer wrote a piece complaining that there were no red
flannels to be found.
   The Cedar Springs' newspaper responded with a tart editorial:
``Just because Saks Fifth Avenue or Bergdorf Goodman do not carry
red flannels, it doesn't follow that no one in the country does.
We've got red flannels in Cedar Springs!''
   The Associated Press ran the newspaper's reply on its wire, and
in a few days, orders began pouring in from around the country to
Cedar Springs merchants. Ironically, those merchants were getting
their red flannels at the time from a Connecticut company.
   When the Connecticut manufacturer discontinued the items, a Cedar
Springs housewife began making red flannels in her home. That was in
1949. Three years later, The Red Flannel Factory was established by
Sally Wall, who converted a barn to meet the growing demand.
   When Wall retired in 1971, a group of about 10 area residents
formed a corporation. In 1986, a Grand Rapids holding company led by
Foley acquired a majority interest in the company with plans to
expand it nationally on a wholesale basis.
   Since then, Foley said, company sales have tripled and the number
of employees has doubled. He won't reveal sales, but says the
company brings in several million dollars a year. About 100
employees work for the company during peak production periods,
usually between June and the day before Christmas. Foley hopes there
will be enough work soon to keep the plant running at capacity
year-round.
   Long johns are the factory's biggest seller, with about 20,000
pairs sold each year. This year, the company is branching out with a
line of children's active wear and will introduce a red-based plaid.
   Among other items produced are night shirts, robes, children's
sleepers and pajamas, most of which are available in white,
natural-fiber muslin as well as the famous scarlet. Long johns
retail from $19 for childrens' sizes to $39 for adults.
   Among the celebrities with the company's long johns in their
closets are Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, Sammy Davis Jr., Kenny
Rogers and Andy Williams, Huckleberry says.
   While some large department stores carry the company's items,
Foley is targeting country stores, lingerie shops, college
bookstores and tourist spots in addition to the factory's mail-order
business.
   The common thread woven through the town's fabric is celebrated
each October with the Red Flannel Festival, complete with a Red
Flannel Queen. The 50th annual event this year will make it among
the oldest in Michigan.
   Anyone failing to wear red during the festival is ``arrested'' by
police and has to make a donation to charity to get out of jail.
   Doug Stein, owner of Der Bier Stein tavern, doesn't have to
worry. He wears a pair of long johns to work every day.
   ``We had to get air conditioning in here just because of that,''
he said with a chuckle.
   Foley hopes George Bush's election to the presidency of a
``kinder, gentler nation'' will help sales.
   ``It's like buying tradition _ a piece of Americana. It's like
buying an American flag,'' Foley said, stopping to reflect on his
last words. ``Maybe that's pushing it.''
