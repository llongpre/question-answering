<LEADPARA>  'I'M NOT a swami-grab-a-buck," insisted Timothy Leary, who was being paid
$2,000 for sharing some decidedly random thoughts with 500 New Yorkers.;

<HEADLINE>  TIMOTHY LEARY GETS TUNED IN TO REALITY .
. . WELL, VIRTUALLY
GURU OF INNER SPACE TRIES THE COMPUTER AGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I'm a one-night stand," explained the psychedelic pioneer variously known
as High Priest of the Inner Voyage, federal prisoner, author of five
autobiographies and, in Richard M. Nixon's phrase, "the most dangerous man in
America.";    Leary was in New York one evening to share his thinking -- or
rather sell it at a price of $19 a person -- about his latest enthusiasm.;   
Virtual reality! Using computers to travel through a space that in reality
doesn't exist!;    But what does exist mean? And reality? The guru who told
America to tune in, turn on and drop out drops the answer you would expect:
"Reality is an opinion.";    Leary came to New York a 70-year-old man to say
the same things he's been saying for years, though he might pause a bit longer
between phrases.;    "I am exploring for the first time in my life the amazing
wonderland known as senility," he said.;    Why won't the 1960s just go away?;
   Jerry Rubin celebrated his 50th birthday by using it as an occasion for
self-promotion.;    Shortly before he died, Abbie Hoffman came to a New York
club to do stand-up comedy. That he was lovable didn't mask the fact that he
wasn't very funny.;    We now have radio stations devoted to the likes of the
Dave Clark Five; there's a new movie out about the Doors; fashions from bell
bottoms to the tent dress are bouncing back; and, heaven knows, we still have
Nixon to kick around.;    "Everything for spring says the 1960s," the Fashions
section of the Times magazine pro claimed recently.;    Leary journeyed to New
York because he journeys everywhere all the time, spreading the cybernetic
gospel and paying a Hollywood celebrity's bills.;    His self-description:
"I'm a Celtic Socratic bard who keeps moving all the time and is out of town
before they can find me and hopefully before they can arrest me.";    Leary
didn't come alone. He brought three colleagues to do much of the talking.;   
All had something to sell.;    One shilled a new product that lets you play
blackjack with your TV. The other two are developing versions of what they
characterize as bargain-basement virtual reality.;    They sounded like
Leary.;    "Reality is a collective hunch," said Mel Seesholtz, an English
professor at Pennsylvania State University. Brian Hughes, president of the
Renaissance Group, a virtual reality company, showed a slide declaring,
"Reality is not enough anymore.";    But Leary managed to make the evening a
determinedly comic routine, excitedly interrupting if the discussion was in
danger of taking a serious turn.;    "Isn't this room a group hallucination?"
he asked at one point.;    One hoped no one believed or approved of his
suggestion that Huckleberry Finn, perhaps the best book written by an
American, might be better presented as a virtual reality video in which
viewers could twist the plot to suit their fancy.;    He exulted that the
archaic nuisance of reading actual words could be eliminated!;    "What do you
want more of?" he inquired at the culmination of one oratorical flight.;   
"What do you want me to talk about?";    "Talk about what's on the program!"
someone screamed.;    But the eccentric performance was the program.;   
Though many left at intermission, others stayed to ask convoluted questions
about the Buddha and magic mushrooms and to collect autographs.;    There was
an inescapable feeling of being stuck in time.;    Leary's clear blue eyes
give the impression of having seen everything, but one wondered: Can they see
anything new?  </TEXT>
