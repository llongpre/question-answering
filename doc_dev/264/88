   A predawn Kenny Loggins concert for
Japanese television drew a ``lynch mob'' of pajama-clad residents to
the stage after they were awakened by the big beat of the
unauthorized show, police said.
   ``Our switchboard lit up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas
tree,'' said Police Lt. Don Williams. Complaints began coming in
shortly before 5 a.m. Wednesday. The show was set for prime time in
Japan, just before 10 p.m.
   Williams said the show from the steps of the historic Old Mission
did not have the city's permission, and when officers arrived they
found a wooden stage full of rock musicians, speakers, electrical
generators, lights and cameras plus a production crew of 75.
   The singer-songwriter later left without being reached for
comment.
   Police shut the show down despite protests from the producer,
James Okumura of Los Angeles, who said he would lose millions of
dollars, according to Williams. Officials said permits he had
requested via facsimile machine a few hours before the show claimed
it would be ``low volume.''
   Some officers had to hold back angry neighborhood residents, many
of whom came to the scene in their nightclothes.
   ``Understandably, it resembled a lynch mob,'' Williams said.
   The Rev. Virgil Cordano of the Mission said he had been told the
production would be quiet, and he granted permission for use of the
building as a backdrop because ``it was good for Santa Barbara and
good for the Mission.''
   ``I thought I was doing the city of Santa Barbara a favor and
spreading the good news to Tokyo,'' he said.
   The matter will be forwarded to the City Attorney's office for
further review, police said.
   Okumura did not immediately return a telephone message left by
The Associated Press on his answering machine Thursday night.

   John F. Kennedy Jr. will join the office of
Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau in August, working
for a man who once worked as a prosecutor for his father.
   Kennedy, a 29-year-old third-year student at New York University
Law School, will start as a prosecutor at just under $30,000 a year
if he graduates next summer and passes the state bar examination,
according to prosecution sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kennedy, interviewed earlier this month by Morgenthau, will be
one of 20 just-graduated new hires next summer. Until he passes the
bar exam he will not litigate cases. Instead he will help in
research and trial preparation.
   The fledgling prosecutor was spotted a few weeks ago in the
Manhattan Criminal Courts Building in the 11th-floor courtroom where
accused child killer Joel Steinberg is on trial for allegedly
beating his 6-year-old illegally adopted daughter to death. Kennedy
declined to talk to reporters.
   Morgenthau was appointed a U.S. attorney during President
Kennedy's administration. He resigned to run for governor of New
York against Nelson Rockefeller in 1962. He lost and resumed his job
as a prosecutor.

   Max von Sydow, whose roles have ranged from
Jesus Christ to intergalactic space villain Ming the Merciless,
dredged memories from his childhood in Sweden to play a downtrodden
field hand in his latest movie.
   In ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' which won top honors at this year's
Cannes Film Festival, Sydow portrays Lasse Karlsson, father of the
title character.
   The 59-year-old, 6-foot-4 actor tells the audience about the
itinerant farm worker's life of labor and oppression with a jerky,
shuffling walk _ hands flapping, elbows and knees protruding _
marked by habitual head bobbing of a servile peasant.
   The son of a university professor, von Sydow left the city after
the spring thaw to visit maternal relatives in Swedish farm country.
   ``I felt I knew this man,'' von Sydow said. ``I met people like
this, spent every summer with them.''
   The story of Pelle's struggle to overcome social restrictions and
farm labor poverty accurately depicts real life during von Sydow's
childhood, the actor said.
   ``The social structure in Scandinavia was pretty primitive in
rural areas until, oh, the early '40s,'' he said. ``The people who
worked the big farms were essentially migrant workers.''
   Von Sydow has appeared on stage, and in numerous films including,
``The Greatest Story Ever Told,'' in which he played Jesus; ``The
Exorcist,'' and ``Flash Gordon,'' in which he portrayed the
science-fiction villain Ming.

   Thirteen-year-old actress Drew Barrymore has
been released from a rehabilitation center after treatment for
alcohol abuse, her publicist said.
   She was released ``a couple of days ago,'' publicist George
Freeman said Thursday. ``She is in good health and great spirits.''
   No other details would be provided, Freeman said.
   Miss Barrymore already was an actress with television commercial
and movie experience at age 6 when she played the impetuous Gertie
in ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.''
   The daughter the reclusive John Barrymor}~d Hungarian-born
actress Ildiko Jaid, Miss Barrymore is the granddaughter of John
Barrymore, who starred in such film classics as ``Grand Hotel'' and
``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.''
   Miss Barrymore also has starred in movies such as ``Firestarter''
and ``Cat's Eye.'' She appeared in the made-for-television movies
``Conspiracy of Love'' and ``Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.''

   PEAPACK-GLADSTONE, N.J. (AP) _ It's no king's ransom, but even
the monarch from Morocco has to enjoy unexpected tax rebates.
   The borough council determined this week that King Hassan II of
Morocco had paid too much in 1988. A check of $4,894 was sent to
Hassan, who owns 500 acres of property in Peapack-Gladstone and two
adjacent towns.
   Councilman Douglas McDowell said the refund comes from tax
appeals heard by the Somerset County Board of Taxation that were not
contested by the borough.
   Last month, Hassan was awarded a $146,000 rebate on his county
taxes because his estate was overappraised. The county revised his
land's appraised value from $25.98 million to $7.3 million.
   As a result, the monarch's 1988 county tax bill was cut from
$204,591 to $57,764.
   The king's attorney, Thomas Goodwin of Saddle River, argued
before county tax officials in October that 225 acres of the king's
estate should be assessed at cheaper farmland rates for 1988. In
addition, Goodwin maintained the remaining 97 acres the monarch owns
in the borough also were assessed too high.
   The king's land is spread over Bedminster, Far Hills and
Peapack-Gladstone.
