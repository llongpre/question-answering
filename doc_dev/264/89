Watching Kenneth Branagh's fine new film of "Henry V" and his Mark Taper 
productions of "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream," it is impossible 
not to realize once more just how easily the work o'erleaps the 400 intervening 
years. 
</P>
<P>
There is a suppleness in the ideas and the characterizations that has let them 
speak to succeeding generations in slightly different ways, thanks to new 
interpreters with fresh eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Olivier's film of "Henry V" in wartime was a glorious cry of 
patriotism and his soliloquy to the embattled island could leave only hearts of 
stone untouched. Branagh's film, from the same root text, is an anti-war 
statement, a kind of poetic docudrama that takes nothing from the charm of the 
boy king nor the glorious valor of his troops but sees them with the irony of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Scofield's Lear, several seasons ago, suggested not a great king but a 
mercantile baron dividing his business empire and then quarreling over who got 
the servants. Yet the language soared, the descent into madness was rending, 
the human tragedy somehow the more affecting because it felt closer to hand, 
more knowable and less mythic, even if in his imperious grandeur, Scofield was 
a mythic figure. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Brier's Lear at the Taper is less regal, less mythic and more mundane 
than Scofield's and in the end less moving, whatever the grace he was falling 
from. Yet the play's language, much of it so familiar in quotation that any 
production seems to have been stitched together from Bartlett's, is thrilling 
to hear being said well. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, many of them (I suspect) drawn as unknowingly and reluctantly to 
Shakespeare as the syllabi make them draw their students to Shakespeare, have 
much to answer for. In our day it is almost invariably necessary to rediscover 
Shakespeare in adulthood, through superior films and magical productions that 
sweep us past the memory of those tiresome classroom days spent searching for 
meaning and the nights spent trying to memorize "To be or not to be" to the 
last correct comma. 
</P>
<P>
The glory of Shakespeare done well and the power of the language to convey 
sense and feeling, even after the subtle changes English has undergone down the 
centuries, inspire inevitable attention on that most astonishing of all the 
authors who have ever written in English. 
</P>
<P>
And, unless you are a hopelessly committed Stratfordian, accepting 400 years of 
legend now solidified, or petrified, into fact, you must surely wonder if the 
untutored lad and sometime smalltime actor from the country could possibly have 
been the author. Could he have had or acquired the author's genius for abstract 
thought, for poetry so magical it transcends time and geography, for the 
delineation of passions and emotions that equally transcend class, as well as 
place and time? 
</P>
<P>
Summing up a television program examining the claims to the authorship of 
Shagsper of Stratford and Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, producer Al 
Austin said: "Those who believe De Vere was Shakespeare must accept an 
improbable hoax as part of it, a conspiracy of silence involving, among others, 
Queen Elizabeth herself. Those who side with the Stratford man must believe in 
miracles." 
</P>
<P>
But of the options, and improbable as it is, the conspiracy of silence is 
easier to accept than the miracle. It is surmised -- but there is no proof of 
it -- that the Stratford man attended the local grammar school. Yet the author 
used a vocabulary of 17,000 words -- twice as many as the well-educated John 
Milton. He also coined 3,000 new words, from Latin and Greek roots. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Twain, an early and eloquent doubter (who had probably never heard of 
Edward de Vere), wrote in a small masterwork of invective called "Is 
Shakespeare Dead" that what we know of his life is "an Eiffel tower of 
artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and very thin foundation of 
inconsequential facts." The reason we don't know more, Twain concluded, is that 
"he hadn't any history to record." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence for De Vere is all circumstantial, monumental but in the end still 
circumstantial. (It fills something like 900 pages in Charlton Ogburn's "The 
Mysterious William Shakespeare.") 
</P>
<P>
The mystery is frustrating but it is also infuriating. Orthodox scholarship has 
chosen almost totally to ignore the possibility that an authorship question 
exists, retreating behind facades of scorn, contempt, indifference and quick 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the early advocates of Francis Bacon in particular carried 
their search for hidden messages encoded in the Shakespeare texts to such 
extremes as to invite ridicule. (They also did a disservice to those who find 
serious philosophical resonances between Bacon and the author.) 
</P>
<P>
The exploration of the authorship question has been left, by default and 
necessity, to those outside academia -- in the United States, in the case of 
the Earl of Oxford, to Charlton Ogburn and to Judge Minos D. Miller and his 
wife, Ruth Loyd Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers, both lawyers, were my accidental introduction to the authorship 
question several years ago. Louisianans, they make an annual visit for research 
at the Huntington Library. They have spent considerable sums publishing new 
editions of relevant books, including a two-volume annotated version of Thomas 
Looney's "Shakespeare Identified in Edward de Vere, Seventeenth Earl of 
Oxford," published in 1920 as the first marking of Oxford as the possible 
author. They have also done, and underwritten, much research in English 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Miller will address the Shakespeare Authorship Roundtable at the Pasadena 
Public Library on Saturday, Feb. 24. Earlier, on Feb. 17, she will address the 
Huntington Westerners on a celebrated 19th-Century California case known as "In 
Re Neagle." 
</P>
<P>
The great Shakespeare mystery itself may well never be solved to everyone's 
satisfaction. But this is not to say the detection should stop -- in or out of 
academia.
