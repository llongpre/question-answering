<DESCRIPT>  FREMONT; LIBRARY; BOOK; CENSORSHIP  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Walk into the Fremont main library this week, and you'll be immediately
implored to browse through a collection of books that some people think others
should never read.;   "Native Son" by Richard Wright. "The Catcher in the Rye"
by J.D. Salinger. "Of Mice and Men" by John Steinbeck. "The Color Purple" by
Alice Walker. And even "Huckleberry Finn" by Mark Twain.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     These and about 40 other books that have been targeted for censorship in
the past are on display through Saturday in Fremont, Newark, Union City and
all Alameda County public libraries as part of National Banned Book Week.;  
The displays tempt library patrons to read the very books that challengers
around the nation have tried to block from public view.;   "This is to inform
people about what's been challenged and to focus on the fact that we are a
diverse society with many views," said Barbara Baxter, head of reference at
the Fremont Main Library. "The library's mission is to represent all views,
not just one or two. (Instead of removing the books), this is kind of calling
people's attention to them. People are always interested in looking at books
that others have challenged.";   Though many take freedom of speech for
granted, attempts to ban books have happened recently.;   In Alameda County,
the requests for book removal happen -- though very rarely. In 1990, the
library system's countywide circulation was 3.8 million books, records and
other materials. During the same year, the library received just eight written
requests to remove books or other materials. None was granted.;   Three of the
requests were in Tri-Cities libraries: A Fremont patron objected to Ed
McBain's mystery "Vespers," saying it was sacrilegious because it includes
passages about satanic rites. A Fremont parent objected to circulation of one
in a series of "Sweet Valley High" books, created by Francine Pascal and
written by Kate William, because it includes a scene in which a teen-age boy
makes a pass at a girl. And in Newark, a patron was shocked by a video of the
movie "Ordinary People" and asked that all movies be rated by the libraries.
They are not.;   Yet public libraries experience fewer censorship attempts
than do schools. People for the American Way, a Washington, D.C.-based
watchdog group, reported that challenges to schoolbooks and teaching materials
went up 33 percent in 1990 -- to 229 -- over the previous year. The highest
number was reported in California, which saw 36 challenges to school
materials.;   Most involved the grade-school reading-book series known as
"Impressions," a collection of works by several authors including Rudyard
Kipling and Judy Blume. In Union City, the New Haven Unified School District
adopted the series in spite of parent objections that some stories promoted
witchcraft, satanism and disrespect for parents.;   National Banned Book Week,
declared by a group of library associations and booksellers, is aimed at
"celebrating the freedom to read," librarians said.;   "Some people object for
religious reasons, others for political reasons, or philosophical reasons,"
Fremont's Baxter said. "Some just consider the books improper. People are
always curious to look at books other people have objected to.";   "The
Catcher in the Rye" has been a frequent target for censorship because of its
profanity and explicit passages. "Grapes of Wrath" has come under attack for
the alleged communist views expressed by author John Steinbeck. Some objected
to "The Color Purple" saying it demeaned and unfairly portrayed black men.
"Native Son," by Richard Wright drew complaints for profanity, sex and
violence. Some thought Twain's "Huckleberry Finn" contained racist stereotypes
of the black character "Jim.";   Even the classic fairy tale "Little Red
Riding Hood" has come under attack in Culver City, because Little Red Riding
Hood carries a bottle of wine along with food in the basket for her
grandmother. Some parents thought that promoted alcohol.;   Many of these
books will be prominently displayed, along with a "Celebrate the Freedom to
Read" poster, at the main libraries in Fremont, Newark and Union City.;   "I
think this helps reaffirm the idea that everyone has a right to a choice,"
said Union City children's librarian Sally Fuentes.;   Gina Smith, young adult
representative for the Newark Public Library, said that banning books can
actually stimulate more interest in reading them. As an example, she said, no
one took much interest in Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses" until Islamic
groups threatened to assassinate the author.;   "Banning never hurts the
books," Smith said. "In fact, it's always helped the authors. When Mark
Twain's books were challenged, the sales went up. Look at 'Satanic Verses.'
When it was challenged, suddenly everyone wanted to read it."  </TEXT>
