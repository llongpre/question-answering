   If they throw the book at Ronald
Redmond, he might just keep it.
   Redmond, 23, is charged with stealing 723 books and 56 record
albums over two years from the library of the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro.
   ``He's probably read most of them,'' said police Detective Glenn
Knight. ``He's a smart man.''
   The books and records are valued at more than $23,000, and
include works by Mark Twain, William Shakespeare and Soren
Kierkegaard, university officials said.
   Police arrested Redmond on Tuesday after raiding his apartment
based on a telephone tip, Knight said.
   ``We originally went there looking for 100 books _ we didn't
expect seven times that,'' he said. ``We had to call a one-ton van
for backup.''
   Redmond, who was graduated from the university last year, told
police he wanted to add to his collection, Knight said.
   Redmond was charged with one felony count of false pretenses and
released on his own recognizance, Knight said.
