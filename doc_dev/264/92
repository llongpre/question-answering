<HEAD>Collector Closes The Book On His Quest For The Zamorano 80</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After 35 years, Henry Clifford finally
has his Zamorano 80, and it's not parked in his garage or orbiting
Saturn, but sitting in a Los Angeles bank vault.
   His Zamorano 80 is one of just two complete collections of 80
rare books declared by the Los Angeles-based Zamorano Club of
bibliophiles in 1945 as works best representing early California
history.
   For more than four decades, the collection of first editions has
had cult following among book collectors. A complete Zamorano 80 is
estimated to be worth between $750,000 and $1 million.
   The book club and the collection were named after Agustin Juan
Vicente Zamorano, who in the 19th century was California's first
printer.
   The books include such well-known titles as Mark Twain's
``Roughing It'' and Bret Harte's ``The Luck of Roaring Camp,'' and
more obscure works such as Robert Louis Stevenson's essays in ``The
Silverado Squatters.''
   Clifford, 78, a retired investment counselor, completed his
collection this year when he bought the last two books for $42,000.
   The only other complete collection is at Yale University. The
University of California, Berkeley has about 70 volumes, and
Huntington Library in San Marino has 79.
   The crown jewel of the collection _ No. 80 missing from the
Huntington collection _ is a 90-page work called ``The Life and
Adventures of Joaquin Murieta, the Celebrated California Bandit,''
by John Rollin Ridge, son of a Cherokee chief.
   Only three or possibly four first editions are believed to
exist. Clifford bought his more than 10 years ago from a private
party in Maine. It was a book-buying coup and ensured that it would
only be a matter of time before he could complete his collection.
   Clifford plans to display his collection next year in San
Francisco, New York or Santa Barbara, and says that in the
meantime, ``anyone who wants to see it can contact me.''
   Anyone, that is, except the Huntington Library.
   ``The Huntington has been hounding me for my collection, but I
won't give it to them,'' said Clifford, a member of the library's
Society of Fellows, which helps support the institution. ``If
things go to a library, they're buried with rare exception.''
