   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev
reached over the crowd of Finnish women, clasping outstretched
fingers and straining to understand shouts of good will.
   ``Good, good Barbara,'' one woman called in Finnish from the
back of the crowd that gathered before the two first ladies Sunday.
   ``Where are you?'' said Mrs. Bush, peering over a jumble of
faces.
   ``Looking nice, Raisa,'' said another woman, interrupting Mrs.
Gorbachev's attempts to make a formal statement through her
interpreter. She reached up and held the hand of the speaker.
   It was the only joint public appearance the two women made
during the brief summit of their husbands, President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   At the suggestion of Mrs. Gorbachev, an academic researcher,
they paged through antique books at the Helsinki University
Library. It holds one of the best collections of Slavic literature
in the West.
   They were surrounded by picture-snapping well-wishers outside
the library and pressed by reporters inside for predictions on the
chances for peace.
   ``Yes, there is a peaceful solution'' to the Persian Gulf
crisis, Mrs. Bush said. ``Otherwise we wouldn't be here.''
   ``I hope our husbands, along with the rest of the free world,
will work hard to make peace,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   Mrs. Gorbachev said, ``As people, as citizens of our
countries,'' the first ladies wanted ``a political, peaceful
solution to be found.''
   Asked whether she was worried about American soldiers sent to
Saudi Arabia, Mrs. Bush said: ``Of course we worry about the men
and the women. We worry.''
   Mrs. Bush wore a royal blue dress and pearls, then changed to a
blue jacket over red dress for the flight home.
   Mrs. Gorbachev wore a severe gray suit and a violet blouse
during the day, appearing less stylish than she has on previous
visits to the West. Mrs. Gorbachev has drawn criticism in the
Soviet Union for her fashionable attire and has made fewer public
appearances lately.
   The first ladies, along with Tellervo Koivisto, wife of the
Finnish president, examined ancient books, manuscripts and maps,
including the oldest known Moscow city map and an early American
map showing California as an island.
   Librarian Esko Hakli escorted the women through the domed,
neoclassical library, pointing out the rarest of its 3 million
books and 2 million other documents.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, a former university professor, repeatedly
prodded him for historical tidbits as they strolled past stacks of
books.
   She urged Mrs. Bush to prepare for a visit to Moscow by studying
the 1538 map. But Hakli told reporters that it shows only the
Moscow River and a few other details ``and you wouldn't find your
way with the help of that map.''
