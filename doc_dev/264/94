   Despite its success in New York in 1928,
``Machinal,'' an expressionistic drama written by Sophie Treadwell,
has been one of Broadway's lost plays.
   There were occasional productions over the years, including one
off-Broadway in 1960, and a script published in an anthology by
women playwrights in 1982. But the play and its feminist author
remained unknown to most theatergoers for some 60 years.
   Unknown, that is, until Michael Greif, a quiet, bespectacled
director with a shy smile and Harpo Marx hair, resurrected it this
fall at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. He turned
``Machinal'' (pronounced mock-en-AHL) into a big hit with the
Public extending the play's sold-out run until the end of November
to accommodate the ticket demand.
   The play is based loosely on the sensational 1927 murder trial
of Ruth Synder, the first woman executed in the electric chair. She
and her lover were convicted of killing Synder's husband.
   Treadwell, a well-known journalist of her day who once obtained
an exclusive interview with Pancho Villa, embellishes on the
real-life story for theatrical effect. Her heroine, called Helen
Jones, is dehumanized by a stifling job, a greedy, grasping mother,
a loveless marriage and finally an ill-fated love affair. She is
society's victim, trapped by a gritty, dark and oppressive
environment.
   The 31-year-old Greif is part of a major change this season at
the Public Theater, where producer Joseph Papp has staged his own
in-house cultural revolution. JoAnne Akalaitis, earth mother of the
avant-garde theater troupe Mabou Mines, was named his artistic
associate.
   And Papp has allowed three young directors to produce their own
programs of plays at Public this year on budgets of $300,000 for
each director. Besides Greif, the directors chosen were George C.
Wolfe, author of ``The Colored Museum'' and ``Spunk,'' and David
Greenspan, who directed ``Kate's Diary'' at the Public last year.
   Greif first directed ``Machinal'' last year in an old framing
warehouse on West 16th Street for a theater company called Naked
Angels. Papp saw the production, liked it and wondered if Greif
wanted to come to the Public Theater.
   ``He asked me what is a very often-asked question at a directing
interview, which is, `If you could choose a season of plays, what
would you choose?' '' Greif recalls.
   ``Machinal'' immediately came to mind. The other two took a
little longer to find.
   ``I ended up choosing the two plays I was most burning to do -
apart from `Machinal,' '' Greif says.
   He picked Tony Kushner's ``A Bright Room Called Day,'' which is
set in Germany during the 1930s. The play, which already has been
done in California, London and Chicago, is about a kind of heroism,
Greif says. Performances begin in December.
   The third offering, ``Casanova,'' by Constance Congdon, was seen
by Greif in a reading at New Dramatists. The playwright is still
working on the play which naturally is about the world's most
celebrated lover. It opens next spring.
   Having his own season of shows is quite a heady experience for a
stage-struck kid from Brooklyn, Brighton Beach to be exact.
   Greif's father was an optician, his mother worked part-time as
an auditor for a life insurance company.
   Their son went to the theater a lot. Instead of going to high
school, he'd sneak off to matinees, usually musicals.
   ``The musical form was actually a form where American directors
did the most interesting and experimental work,'' Greif says.
   He directed in high school, putting together what he calls
``very idealistic, very crude original musicals.''
   He studied acting and directing at Northwestern University in
Illinois, but ended up in California for more courses on directing
with Beckett guru Alan Schneider at the University of California at
San Diego.
   Greif also worked as an assistant to director Des McAnuff, who
was just starting up a new theater program at the nearby La Jolla
Playhouse.
   He assisted McAnuff on the director's regional theater
productions of ``Big River,'' a musical version of ``The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn'' that eventually made it to Broadway.
   ``I supported myself for a couple of years directing `Big River'
tours,'' Greif says, including the Japanese and Australian
productions.
   ``Machinal'' was brought to Greif's attention three or four
years ago by Jodie Markell, who plays the leading role. The two
went to school together at Northwestern and always had talked of
working together.
   ``The play requires an ensemble that is willing to really be a
part of a fabric, a great whole, and be comfortable in working in a
stylized way,'' Greif says. ``The production works because it keeps
a fine line between a completely stylized approach and also a very
human approach. It dances back and forth.''
   Does he have any more lost plays waiting to be discovered?
   ``They are still lost,'' Greif laughs. ``I'd like to uncover
more, but I'm too busy. That's the joy of being an unemployed
director. You have more time to find them.''
