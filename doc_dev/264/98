   President Reagan's decision to stop in Finland
for three days before the Moscow summit sent his hosts scurrying
for ways to entertain him in grand style. They even promised him an
audience with Santa Claus.
   St. Nick lives in Rovaniemi, a snowy town snuggled against the
Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland, according to Finland's tourist
board and the local postmen who received 354,136 letters addressed
to Santa in 1987.
   When Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri visited the White
House recently, he proposed a meeting between Reagan and Santa
during the president's three-night stopover in Helsinki.
   But there's no Finnish Santa Claus on Reagan's schedule.
   Instead, Reagan's sojurn in Helsinki, beginning early Thursday,
will become one of those predominantly private study, rest and
jet-lag recovery stops that have become a pre-summit tradition of
the 77-year-old chief executive.
   Except for a brief visit with Finnish government leaders and a
single speech, Reagan will be nestled in a government guest house
with his briefing books and advisers, boning up on strategy for his
May 29-June 2 talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Moscow.
   The Finns had hoped to provide a showy round of events for
Reagan, the first president to visit Finland since Gerald R. Ford
traveled to Helsinki in 1975 to sign a European security and human
rights accord.
   However, keeping a low profile is something the Finns can relate
to.
   ``They're hard to find among the birch trees up there and they
like it that way,'' a U.S. official said.
   For more than four decades, Finland has managed through
soft-spokenness, compromise and neutrality to share a border almost
800 miles long with the Soviet Union and remain an independent,
prosperous and democratic nation.
   In the late 1940s, when Moscow _ to use Cold War rhetoric _
gobbled up Eastern Europe, Finnish leaders made clear they would
fight overt aggression as they had resisted Soviet attack in the
Winter War of 1939-40.
   At the same time, they assured Stalin they would remain outside
the Western sphere of influence and accommodate Soviet interests _
a bargain that preserved Finnish autonomy but gave Finland a
reputation in the United States as a subject nation, an object of
pity.
   ``It is commonplace to believe that Finns live on the razor's
edge, at the mercy of their powerful neighbor,'' former
high-ranking Finnish diplomat Max Jakobson wrote in his 1985 book
``Finland: Myth and Reality.''
   It seems bizarre in Western eyes, he wrote, that Finland could
be a neutral country yet remain faithful to a pact that envisages
military cooperation with the Soviet Union. It seems weird that a
Scandinavian democracy could live ``in apparent harmony with its
communist neighbor.''
   ``This looks to some foreign observers like the Indian rope
trick: a clever thing to do but not quite believable,'' Jakobson
said.
   Commercial policy provides an example of how it works. Finland
has a free, open and prosperous economy, but it has an agreement
with the Soviet Union to keep trade at a balanced level. It runs
its commerce with the Soviets through a state trading company, a
practice no other Western country follows.
   Coincidentally, the $2 billion a year in Finnish-U.S. trade is
roughly balanced as well.
   The even-handed policy seems to include high-level visits and
celebrations of anniversaries. Reagan will be in Finland this week,
while Gorbachev is coming in the fall.
   The Finns and the Russians are celebrating the 40th anniversary
of their Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance
this year. The United States and Finland are commemorating the
350th anniversary of the arrival in America of the first Finns, who
landed with other Scandinavians in what is now Wilmington, Del.
   Even then, the Finns were keeping a low profile. The colony was
called New Sweden.
