THE BIGGEST FISH IN WALDEN POND  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     UCSB is roughly 3,000 miles from Walden Pond at Concord, Mass., where the
renowned writer spent two years in a shack writing "Walden." But it is at UCSB
that all Thoreau's writings, published and unpublished, are being assembled
for publication in his own words, before editing occurred.;    In his own
lifetime Thoreau, among the most influential 19th-century writers, was not
considered successful. Only a handful of his essays and two books, "Walden"
and "A Week on Concord and Merrimac Rivers," were published.;    Yet his words
influenced such reformers as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. His
pioneering theories of natural history paved the way for present-day
environmental activists. His impact on the civil rights movement and the
preservation of natural resources continues to this day, 128 years after his
death.;    Refused to pay poll tax;  In his famous essay on civil disobedience
written in 1846, after he spent a night in jail for refusing to pay poll
taxes, he said he could not support a government that endorsed slavery and
waged an imperial war against Mexico.;    "There is a higher law than the
civil one, and the higher law must be followed even if a penalty ensues. So
does its consequences. Under a government which imprisons unjustly, the true
place for a just man is also a prison," Thoreau wrote.;    He led a simple
life, writing in longhand his observations on nature and his reflections on
important events. Every day for 21 years he expressed his thoughts on paper,
from age 23 until he died of tuberculosis at age 44 in 1862.;    "We believe
we have 90 percent of everything Thoreau wrote. We're still looking for
anything we may have missed," said Elizabeth Witherell, 42, editor-in-chief of
the Thoreau Edition for 10 of her 16 years on the project. "Our plan is
eventually to publish Thoreau's complete works in 27 volumes. His day-to-day
journals alone will account for 13 volumes," she said.;    Since the project
started in 1966, nine hardbacks in the series have been published, with the
10th, "Journal 3: 1848-1851," due in December. All are published by Princeton
University Press. The Thoreau Edition was headquartered at Princeton until
1983, when it moved to UCSB.;    Witherell expects that it will take another
17 to 25 years before the complete works of Thoreau will be in print.;   
Seeking out U.S. writers;  It was the 105-year-old Modern Language
Association, whose 30,000 members are college language and literature
teachers, that decided to publish everything written by 15 of the leading
18th- and 19th-century American writers. In addition to Thoreau, the writers
include Mark Twain, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Washington
Irving, Herman Melville and Walt Whitman.;    Thirty literary scholars at
universities nationwide have collected, sorted and processed the Thoreau
material. Nine editors are working on future volumes.;    To date, the Thoreau
Edition has cost about $2 million. Half of the funding has come from the
National Endowment for the Humanities, the other half from various
institutions that provide space, utilities and salaries for researchers and
editors.;    Gathering the Thoreau material has involved a great deal of
detective work. First, the researchers obtained photocopies of writings from
the major Thoreau collections: the Concord Public Library; the Henry E.
Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif.; the New York Public Library; the
Harvard University Library; and the J. Pierpont Morgan Library.;    Then,
letters were sent to libraries and to book sections of newspapers nationwide,
asking for Thoreau material.;    "We get a little bit here, a little bit
there," Witherell said.  </TEXT>
