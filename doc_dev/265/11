<LEADPARA>  IT HAS been 55 years since Scarlett O'Hara last sashayed down a staircase, but
her admirers still wait for her in bookstores across the country.;   "We're
already sold out," said Louise Riley, manager of Books, Inc. in San Jose,
where 40 copies of "Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's 'Gone With The
Wind' " were sold Wednesday before you could say "I don't know nothin' 'bout
birthin' no baby."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The story was the same at other South Bay bookstores, where phone lines
were clogged with readers trying to find copies of romance writer Alexandra
Ripley's continuation of the Scarlett O'Hara-Rhett Butler story.;   Some
900,000 copies of the 823-page book, published by Warner Books and priced at
$24.95, were shipped to stores across the country for Wednesday's nationwide
release.;   The sequel has quite a reputation to live up to. Mitchell's
Pulitzer Prize-winning "Gone With the Wind" has sold more copies than any book
except the Bible.;   But "Scarlett" is off to a good start, at least in sales.
Bookstore clerks reported they hadn't seen such action since dozens of people
signed up on waiting lists last summer for "Final Exit," a book about death
and methods of suicide.;   Readers grabbed "Scarlett" from the 16 Bay Area B.
Dalton bookstores so fast that clerks couldn't keep enough copies on hand to
build displays, said Mike Davis, San Francisco Bay Area district manager for
the chain.;   Even the founder of Crown Books said he couldn't latch on to a
copy.;   "I'm very interested," said Robert Haft, Crown's president and
founder. "I tried to get a copy, but I haven't been able to yet.";   Crown,
with 255 stores nationwide and 32 in the Bay Area, had ordered "tens of
thousands" of copies, Haft said, and sold most of them Wednesday.;   At
Crown's Los Altos store, a clerk said a few people were waiting at 8 a.m. to
buy the book. By early afternoon, the store had a couple copies left from its
initial shipment of 20.;   Not so at Kepler's Books in Menlo Park, where
clerks called dozens of people on a waiting list when the store's shipment of
40 books arrived Tuesday.;   "We were sold out by 3 or 4 p.m.," said Teresa
Block, a Kepler's supervisor.;   The store has 260 copies on order and hopes
to get them today or Monday, when clerks will phone anxious readers on the
waiting list.  </TEXT>
