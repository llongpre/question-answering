<LEADPARA>  FORGET EVERYTHING you've heard. There is no sequel to "Gone With the Wind.";  
There is a book just out by novelist Alexandra Ripley that's all about Rhett
Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It's got the official imprimatur of the Margaret
Mitchell estate.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's no sequel, though. All the Mitchell estate handed to Ripley was the
legal right to some characters. But what made "Gone With the Wind" great was
not Rhett and Scarlett -- it was Margaret Mitchell, but she died in 1949, and
she's still dead.;   The idea that you can bequeath genius is so absurd I'm
surprised anybody has fallen for it. In most of the individual arts, nobody
would. Wanna buy a hot-off-the-easel official sequel to Da Vinci's "The Last
Supper"? Thought not. How about Guns 'n' Roses doing Beethoven's 9th Symphony
-- Part II?;   Actually, Beethoven has been done, in a way. In the 1980s, Dr.
Barry Cooper, with access to Beethoven's original sketches, completed the
symphony the master never lived to write -- No. 10. Cooper's version was
recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra under conductor Wyn Morris.;  
Cooper's work is fascinating, but it isn't Beethoven. All Cooper could do is
finish the work with techniques and styles that Beethoven had used in previous
works. That's the very thing, however, that Beethoven would not have done; he
would have done something he hadn't done before, something that nobody else
imagined in the same way, because he was Beethoven. And that's what makes his
work worth something, not whether it's in symphonic structure and in an
"authentic" early 19th-century musical language.;   There've been literary
sequels, too. Devotees of Sherlock Holmes, inconsolable because there are only
64 short stories and four novels by A. Conan Doyle, have written Holmes
pastiches for nearly a century. Some of these are by very fine writers, from
John Dickson Carr to Stephen King. As good as some of the stories are, they
leave me with an ineffable sadness, because they either echo Conan Doyle's
earlier work or strike out in directions that belong to the new writer.
Neither is Holmes. Conan Doyle is dead, too.;   What we have here, in this new
Scarlett O'Hara book, is the embodiment of art as product, of the idea that
true genius lies in the marketing concept, not the work itself. Is "Gone With
the Wind" such an enduringly popular book that it has somehow crossed the line
from culture to commodity? To say so would be to shamefully underrate it.
Mitchell's single book, for better or worse, has shaped concepts of the South
and romance for three generations of Americans. It was her vision, it died
with her, and the Mitchell estate can't rent it out because it hasn't got it.  </TEXT>
