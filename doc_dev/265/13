   NEW YORK -- Considering what a procrastinator Scarlett
O'Hara was, it's probably only fitting that the sequel to
"Gone With the Wind" is coming out a year late.
   The Warner Books division of Time Warner Inc. had planned
to publish the sequel last fall, but the manuscript by
romance writer Alexandra Ripley was behind schedule, sparking
rumors that the book was poorly written. Warner Books had
been planning a big party to promote the book, for which it
bid $5 million at an auction, at the annual American
Booksellers Association convention in June.

   Now, "Scarlett: the Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone
With the Wind" is finished and scheduled to be published
Sept. 25, says Laurence Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books.
Reflecting his and Warner's confidence in the novel's
acceptance is a first-print run of 500,000 books, the kind of
quantity that is rare except for mega-selling authors like
Stephen King. But, after all, "Gone With the Wind" has sold
more than 25 million copies since 1936.
   Mr. Kirshbaum refuses to say whether Scarlett gets back
together with Rhett Butler. "You'll have to pay $24.95 to
find out," he says. "It's the story of a woman coming to
terms with herself, and I think the readers want that." The
William Morris agency, which handles the rights to the book
for the Mitchell estate, has seen the just-finished
manuscript and may sell movie rights soon, says Mr.
Kirshbaum. Nonetheless, "We have the only complete copy, and
we're keeping it under lock and key."
