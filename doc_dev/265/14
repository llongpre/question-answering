Burn Down the City of Atlanta?

   Atlantans just don't seem to give a damn about "Gone With the Wind." 

   In yet another back of the hand to the Margaret Mitchell book and movie, residents of nearby Clayton County voted overwhelmingly this week to reject a $23 million plan to build and furnish a replica of Tara, the O'Hara family mansion. 
There was also to be an exhibition center and museum modeled after the Wilkes' mansion, Twelve Oaks. 

   Supporters blame the sales-tax increase that would have paid for the would-be tourist mecca. 
Perhaps. 
But local residents do have a history of turning against the 1939 Civil War saga, set in that Atlanta area. 

   About 10 years ago, for instance, Herb Bridges, perhaps the area's premier "Gone With the Wind" buff, set up a downtown museum containing his memorabilia, which include such items as Scarlett O'Hara paper dolls, perfume and bookends. 
While tourists flocked to it, he says, residents weren't interested, and he was forced to close it after a few years. 

   More recently, local preservationists have been stifled trying to raise money to save and restore a vacant, dilapidated apartment house that Mrs. Mitchell lived and wrote in. 
A developer recently applied to demolish the structure, a request now before Mayor Andrew Young. 

   Such apathy baffles Thomas Hal Clarke, a lawyer for the Mitchell estate. 
"When you travel abroad and tell people you're from Atlanta, the first thing they want to know is Tara," he says. 

   Of course, until recently the estate helped damp any enthusiasm for "Gone With the Wind" attractions by opposing commercialization of the book. 

   Moreover, many Atlantans worry that "Gone With the Wind" attractions will only remind them of a time of slavery and racial segregation, says Deborah James, president of the Margaret Mitchell Museum, which at this point only exists on paper. 

   But other people think that tomorrow is another day. 
The latest planned project is in nearby Coweta County, where developers plan to build a theme park around the Tara facade that was used on the Hollywood movie lot where "Gone With the Wind" was filmed. 

   Betty Talmadge, who had owned and stored the facade for 10 years in a warehouse, insists this tourist attraction will finally fly. 
"When people go out West they want to see cowboys," she says. 
"When they come to Atlanta they want to see Scarlett and Rhett."
