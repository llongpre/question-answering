   It won't be quite the social event it was 50
years ago and the big stars will be absent, but that's not stopping
Atlanta from throwing a party for this week's re-creation of the
premiere of ``Gone With the Wind.''
   On the day of the Dec. 15, 1939, premiere, the governor declared
a holiday and an estimated 1 million people turned out to see Clark
Gable, Vivien Leigh and Atlanta's own Margaret Mitchell, author of
the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1936 book on which the movie was based.
   This time, star-seekers will have to settle for 10 minor cast
members and five pairs of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara
look-alikes. Gable and Miss Leigh both died in the 1960s, and Miss
Mitchell died in 1949.
   The 10 surviving cast members will attend a private reunion
Wednesday night and will make a public appearance Thursday. The
look-alikes will compete Tuesday, and the winners will appear at
Thursday night's antebellum ball.
   Friday night's ``re-premiere'' will be held at the ornate Fox
Theatre, opened on Christmas 1929, since the Loew's Grand Theatre,
site of the 1939 gala, is no longer standing. The Fox was saved
from the wrecker's ball in the 1970s and now is on the National
Register of Historic Places,
   Cammie King Conlon, who played Rhett and Scarlett's young
daughter, Bonnie Blue Butler, said the cast reunion will be a
chance for her to reminisce with others who also were children when
they appeared in the movie.
   ``I was 4{ when they did the filming,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Little River, Calif., where she manages a
contemporary art gallery. She said she remembers ``about 12
snapshots, images'' of the experience, but nothing more.
   ``You don't really know how much you remember because people
have told you some things,'' she said. ``I certainly remember the
pony,'' which killed Bonnie Blue in a riding accident.
   ``Clark Gable I remember being a very nice, nice daddy,'' she
added. ``He was considerate of me, my mother said. I don't remember
Vivien Leigh at all.''
   Others expected for the reunion are Butterfly McQueen, who
played Prissy; Patrick Curtis, Ric Holt and Mickey Kuhn, all of
whom played Beau Wilkes, son of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes, at
various ages; Gregg Geiss, who played Bonnie Blue as an infant;
Rand Brooks, who played Scarlett's first husband, Charles Hamilton;
Ann Rutherford and Evelyn Keyes, who portrayed Scarlett's sisters;
and Fred Crane, who played one of the twins courting Scarlett in
the opening scene.
   Two other surviving cast members _ Olivia de Havilland, who
played Melanie, and Alicia Rhett, who played India Wilkes _ sent
their regrets.
   Many of the anniversary activities are sponsored by Turner Home
Entertainment, a division of entrepreneur Ted Turner's media empire.
   Turner acquired the rights to ``Gone With the Wind'' in 1985
when he bought MGM-UA Entertainment Corp.'s film library for $1.5
billion. And he paid for a restored version of the film that has
made a 50th anniversary tour of U.S. theaters this year.
   ``It's his favorite movie,'' said Frank Miller, a Turner
spokesman.
   The $250,000 restoration process used modern technology to make
a new, better quality print from the original negatives. The
restored version will be featured at Friday night's ``re-premiere.''
   Before the film, a motorcade will shuttle celebrities from CNN
Center to the Fox for a reception. Afterward, a champagne breakfast
will re-create another event from the 1939 gala. Tickets for the
evening range from $15 to $100.
   Other activities include tours of historic homes in Atlanta and
suburban Clayton County, where Miss Mitchell set her fictional
plantation Tara; a GWTW exhibit at the Atlanta Historical Society;
and lectures on Miss Mitchell and her book.
   Turner's SuperStation TBS, whose signal is relayed to cable TV
systems by satellite, will broadcast the restored version of the
film three times during the week.
