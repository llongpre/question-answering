<LEADPARA>  How would a writing program compare Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind"
with Alexandra Ripley's sequel, "Scarlett"?;   Mark McBride, president of
Scandinavian PC Systems of Rockville, Md., analyzed samples of "Gone With the
Wind" and "Scarlett." The works of several other best-selling novelists were
thrown in, too.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The program, Corporate Voice, does not pretend to judge literary quality or
the lack of it. It analyzes a written document from several points of view:
readability measured by grade level readability standards and also by a
standard selected by the user.;   But the program did find that the styles of
all the writers were very similar.;   "The words were different; the plot,
setting and characters were different," McBride said, "but the readability and
cadence of the writing was extremely close. Moreover, our analysis indicates
that there is a certain rhythm and readability common to all these writers,
and it's obviously a rhythm that persuades and sells in the mass market.";  
As for the Mitchell-Ripley books, Brown wrote: "Today's Scarlett is just as
hoopskirted as the one Mitchell wrote about nearly 70 years ago. The computer
writing-analysis program also found that she is as terse and straightforward
as she was when Mitchell introduced her to the public in the 1930s.";   "Gone
With the Wind" may be slightly more challenging than "Scarlett," however. The
original, the program found, was written at what is now considered a
fifth-grade reading level; the sequel is written at a fourth-grade level.;  
This grade-level business is not meant to suggest that only dummies read best
sellers. Even Ph.D.s don't want to read difficult things all the time. They
take a Dick Francis or Tom Clancy novel to the beach, like everyone else.;  
Corporate Voice, for MS-DOS computers, has a suggested retail price of
$249.95. It can be found at many software stores or ordered from the company
at (800) 487-7727. There is no guarantee, however, that it will put your next
interoffice memo on the best-seller list.  </TEXT>
