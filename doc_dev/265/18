   Rhett Butler with a wide, painted-on mustache,
meandering eyebrows, eye glasses and a cigar?
   Well, if author Margaret Mitchell had her way and had been really
serious about it, it would have been Groucho Marx who swept Miss
Scarlett up all those stairs for a taste of Southern lust instead of
Clark Gable.
   With all the Hollywood hype to recruit stars for ``Gone With the
Wind,'' Mitchell, who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning best seller,
kept her distance because she feared fellow Southerners would blame
her if the movie didn't turn out well. She didn't want to help write
the script, wouldn't participate in the casting search for stars and
finally coughed up her own candidate: the ribald comic.
   As one of the most popular movies of all time, ``Gone With the
Wind'' is awash with such nuggets.
   Did you know, for example, that the winner of eight Academy
Awards was panned by some critics?
   ``A major event in the history of the industry but only a minor
event in motion picture art. There are moments when the two
categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are
filled with mere spectacular efficiency,'' wrote Franz Hoellering in
The Nation.
   ``Shakespeare's `The Taming of the Shrew' seems to have gotten
mixed up with one of the novels of Ethel M. Dell,'' wrote James
Agate.
   Here are some other ``Gone With the Wind'' factoids:
   _ Two soundtracks were released with the 1939 film _ one for
domestic distribution and one for overseas. In the international
version there was strident marching music and the visual was an
elaborate description of the North-South conflict. The domestic
version had a sweet version of ``Dixie'' and talked about the
halcyon days in the South that are gone with the wind.
   _ With all the Oscars the movie copped, there was one significant
omission: Clark Gable. He lost out to Robert Donat for his
performance in ``Goodbye, Mr. Chips.''
   _ Hattie McDaniel, who won an Academy Award for supporting
actress for her role as the maid Mammy, kept her long, manicured
fingernails in the movie as her own way of protesting the treatment
of blacks in Hollywood. She was not, she wanted the world to know, a
maid. She was the first black actor ever nominated for an Oscar and
the first to ever win.
   _ Vivien Leigh refused to have any embraces with Gable when they
first began shooting the movie because of a foul mouth odor caused
by his dentures. He eventually remedied the problem.
   _ Cammie King Conlon, who portrayed Bonnie Blue, Rhett and
Scarlett's little girl, couldn't stop blinking while playing dead so
a mask of her face was made and used over her real face. Also, it
wasn't the actress who fell from the pony but a midget. And a
blue-eyed boy played Bonnie Blue as an infant.
   _ Scenes of the Tara plantation and the burning of Atlanta were
filmed at the backlot of Laird Studios in downtown Culver City,
Calif.
   _ Walter Plunkett, the movie's costume designer, was given a box
of thorns by a woman in Charleston, S.C., because during the Civil
War, there were no metal pins and clothing was held together by the
thorns.
   _ The structure which collapses in flames during the burning of
Atlanta had also been the Temple of Jerusalem in ``King of Kings''
and the native village in ``King Kong.''
   _ George Cukor began as director of the movie but Clark Gable
complained that he favored the female actresses. Sam Wood and
William Cameron Menzies also had directorial stints on the epic. But
it was Victor Fleming who ultimately got the main credit and the
Oscar for best director.
   _ The film rights for the blockbuster were purchased for a mere
$50,000 in 1936.
   _ Paulette Goddard was Selznick's first choice for Scarlett. But
he feared her attachment to Charlie Chaplin would be bad publicity.
She and Chaplin later married.
   _ Leslie Howard only agreed to appear in the movie as the wimpy
Ashley Wilkes after Selznick agreed to make him associate producer
on ``Intermezzo,'' Ingrid Bergman's first Hollywood film.
   _ The Ocala, Fla., chapter of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy protested the casting of Vivien Leigh, who was British,
as the Southern heroine.
   _ Irving Thalberg, who directed MGM production under studio head
Louis B. Mayer, didn't think ``Gone With the Wind'' stood a chance
at the box office. Said he to Louis B., ``Forget it, Louis. No Civil
War picture ever made a nickel.''
   The movie went on to break box office records its first year by
grossing $14 million.
