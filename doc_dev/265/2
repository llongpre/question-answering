<LEADPARA>  'SCARLETT: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind" won't be in
bookstores until Sept. 25, but fans of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara can
get an early glimpse in Life magazine.;   Life will run nine pages of
"Scarlett" in its September issue, on newsstands Monday. And although Life
doesn't reveal if Scarlett gets Rhett back, the excerpts are a tantalizing
peek at Alexandra Ripley's much-publicized 768-page sequel.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The excerpts will be the first taste readers -- and reviewers -- get of the
"Gone With the Wind" sequel. Warner Books, which paid $4.7 million for
publishing rights to "Scarlett," has carefully controlled information about
the manuscript. Warner spokeswoman Lynn Goldberg said the books would be
shipped simultaneously to 36 countries on Sept. 25. No advance galleys or
readers' copies are being offered to reviewers; Goldberg said the book "is
under lock and key.";   Why a sequel?;   Mitchell, who died in 1949 in a taxi
accident, always declined to write one, saying the story had come to its
"natural and proper ending." Her classic has sold more than 28 million copies
since it was published in 1936.;   David O. Selznick's 1939 film based on the
novel has become a classic in its own right. It starred Clark Gable and Vivien
Leigh.;   The copyright on the Mitchell book expires in 2011, and Mitchell's
heirs faced the prospect of future profits being, indeed, gone with the wind.;
  In 1988 the Mitchell estate named Ripley, a writer of historical novels, as
Mitchell's successor. According to Goldberg, Life bought first serial rights
(for an undisclosed amount) to "Scarlett" in a literary auction at the time
that Ripley signed with the Mitchell estate, and also ran an exclusive
interview with Ripley. Goldberg said Life selected the excerpts it would run.;
  So far, what Warner Books has revealed about "Scarlett" is sketchy:;  
(check) The triangle of Scarlett, Ashley and Rhett is still intact, but
several other dashing (and single) heroes are introduced;;   (check) the
action takes place in Charleston, Savannah and in Ireland, with Atlanta and
Tara playing secondary roles;;   (check) and "the South" is a very different
place in the sequel. In "The Scarlett Letter," a press release -- on pink
paper -- touting the new book, Warner Books reveals that, in "Scarlett,"
"Slavery is over and, appropriately, there is no slave dialect in the sequel.
The new attitudes of the postwar South are reflected in the changing attitudes
and beliefs of Scarlett.";   Now, to those excerpts, which were faxed to the
press Aug. 8:;   First, it should be acknowledged that most fans of "Gone With
the Wind" are remembering the movie, not the 1,037-page book; many bought it,
but few read it, even when it was first published. (Rumors circulated at the
time the film was being made that not even the stars had been able to wade
through Mitchell's syrupy Southern prose.);   But for those of us who made it,
Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning accomplishment was clear. Her overwriting
only embellished her images of an overly stylized society; with her elaborate
literary constructions she recreated in style, language and pace the mythic
antebellum South.;   Gone with the sequel (at least in the excerpts) are the
sweeping descriptions and purple prose that made the original work. Ripley is
no Mitchell, and the excerpts of Ripley's work show no sign of the flair for
establishing time and place that gave "Gone With the Wind" its languid pace
and authentic flavor.;   Dialect, too, was part of setting the stage. Like any
good romance writer, Ripley is enamored of exclamation points, to the
detriment of the flow of conversation. And in sanitizing her characters'
speech to conform with modern political correctness, Ripley strips her
protagonists of their historical perspective.;   These nine pages are slow
going, and not for the valid reasons that marked Mitchell's original. Ripley's
style is choppy, her characterizations shallow. The love scene in the excerpt
is standard romance novel stuff. And, while the story is interesting, the
reader will find it difficult to "get inside" Scarlett's head, despite all of
Ripley's exposition.;   From this glimpse of Ripley's 768-page epic, it seems
that Mitchell's long-standing response to requests for a sequel to "Gone With
the Wind" was the correct one:;   Fiddle-dee-dee!  </TEXT>
