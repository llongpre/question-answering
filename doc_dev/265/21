<LEADPARA>  The sequel to one of the biggest Hollywood blockbusters of all time, "Gone
With the Wind," is coming to television -- and not the big screen -- in a
record-breaking deal that cost more than $8 million.;   RHI Entertainment
Inc., the producer and distributor that made the miniseries "Lonesome Dove,"
purchased rights to "Scarlett" in association with CBS television and two
European distributors.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Scarlett" will appear as miniseries on CBS in 1993.;   RHI Chairman Robert
Halmi said Sunday it cost more than $8 million to acquire the rights from the
estate of Margaret Mitchell, author of "Gone With the Wind.";   The part of
Rhett Butler will be played by an established actor, Halmi said, but he plans
a nationwide search for an actress to play Scarlett, much like the one David
Selnizk conducted in the 1930s for "Gone With the Wind." A then-unknown Vivien
Leigh was cast at the last minute.;   "Scarlett" author Alexandra Ripley,
chosen by Mitchell's estate to write the sequel, will not be involved in the
miniseries, Halmi said.;   Despite mostly lousy reviews, "Scarlett" has sold
more than 5 million copies.;    The highest price previously paid for the
rights to a book was the $2.5 million paid by United Artists in 1979 for Gay
Talese's "Thy Neighbor's Wife," according to Larry Blaustein of the William
Morris Agency, which handled the negotiations. The film was never made.  </TEXT>
