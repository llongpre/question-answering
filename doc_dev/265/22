<HEAD>Warner Books Wins Rights To Mitchell Book Sequel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   With a bid of $4.94 million, Warner Books has
won the right to publish the much-ballyhooed sequel to Margaret
Mitchell's civil war novel ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``We wanted to be the first to know what happened to Rhett and
Scarlett,'' said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books,
after his company won the Monday night auction.
   Warner Books now has the right to publish the sequel in the
United States and Canada. The manuscript, to be written by novelist
Alexandra Ripley, is expected to be finished late next year and
published in 1990.
   At least six publishers took part in the auction, organized by
the William Morris Agency as agents for Miss Mitchell's estate.
Warner Books' bid topped Dell Publishing Co., which offered $4.8
million.
   According to publishing company executives quoted by The New
York Times, Warner must sell about 250,000 hardback copies at $25
each and 33 million paperbacks to make money on the book.
   But Kirshbaum would not confirm those figures: ``I'm going to
think about it tomorrow,'' he said, lifting a line from Scarlett
O'Hara.
   The original novel has sold 25 million copies since it was first
published in 1936.
