   A French editor paid a record $1 million for the
rights to publish the French version of the sequel to the American
classic ``Gone With the Wind,'' the editing company said Tuesday.
   Pierre Belfond of Editions Belfond said it was the largest sum
ever paid for translation rights by a French publisher.
   In the United States, Warner Books is paying novelist Alexandra
Ripley nearly $5 million to write the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's
only novel. The sequel, which has yet to be named, is to be released
in 1990, said Warner spokeswoman Theresa Wiltz in New York.
   The French firm outbid six others in an auction last week to
acquire the rights from the William Morris Co. of New York, which
controls overseas rights to the book, Belfond said.
   Mitchell's novel, enormously successful when it was published in
1936, was the basis for the film classic starring Clark Gable as
Rhett Butler and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.
   Belfond has published translations of other best-selling American
novels, including Jacqueline Susann's ``Valley of the Dolls.''
   French publisher Gallimard, which raked in millions with the
translation of ``Autant en Emporte le Vent'' (``Gone With the
Wind'') when it was published here in 1939, did not take part in
negotiations for the sequel.
   A Gallimard spokesman said $1 million was ``an exhorbitant amount
to pay for a doubtful return.''
   Belfond acknowledged the purchase was a gamble. The French
edition is expected to be on bookstore shelves by the end of 1990.
