   Marsh, who had suffered from heart problems, lived less than
three years after his wife died. Because the Marshes had no
children, the rights to ``Gone With the Wind'' went to Stephens
Mitchell, who died in 1983.
   Today all ``Gone With the Wind'' royalties belong to his two
sons, Gene and Joe, although the rights to the book are in the
hands of an administrative committee of three Atlanta lawyers. The
committee, which is self-appointing, is to exist as long as there
is business generated by ``Gone With the Wind.''
   Margaret Mitchell, born in Atlanta in 1900, took nearly 10 years
to write her famous book, the only one she ever published. A former
reporter for The Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine, she based her
1,037-page novel on the Civil War stories she heard as a child from
those who lived through the war and Reconstruction.
   Prior to ``Gone With the Wind,'' Peggy Mitchell Marsh was known
to her friends as a petite, fun-loving and often irreverent
socialite who loved to give parties for journalists and Atlanta's
literary crowd.
   Some of them knew she was working on a book, keeping the
manuscript in a growing pile of manila envelopes in the living room
of her apartment, but she refused to talk about it.
   ``We all wondered what Peggy's book was going to be about,''
recalls Yolande Gwin, a retired society writer for the Constitution.
   The 1936 publication of the novel, which won a Pulitzer Prize
the next year, placed Miss Mitchell and her husband, a Georgia
Power Co. executive, squarely in an unwelcome spotlight.
   ``I am sure Scarlett O'Hara never struggled harder to get out of
Atlanta or suffered more during the siege of Atlanta than I have
suffered during the siege that has been on since publication day,''
she wrote in July 1936.
   It was her desire to keep her private life private that prompted
Miss Mitchell to ask her brother to have their childhood home razed
after he no longer had use for it. The house was torn down in the
1950s, but its site is marked with a plaque placed by the Georgia
Historical Commission.
   Another GWTW landmark _ the Loew's Grand Theater, where the film
based on her book had its gala premiere in 1939 _ was gutted by
fire in 1978 and has been replaced by an office tower. Its site
also is marked with a plaque.
   Atlanta has a Margaret Mitchell Court, Margaret Mitchell Drive,
Margaret Mitchell Square and Margaret Mitchell Elementary School,
plus a handful of library exhibits about her life and work.
   But efforts to establish a Mitchell museum in Atlanta or nearby
Clayton County, where her fictional plantation Tara was set, have
so far been as unsuccessful as the Confederate cause. The latest _
a campaign to save ``The Dump,'' the apartment building where she
wrote much of the book _ has been tied up in court since early last
year.
   The anniversary of Miss Mitchell's death this year may go
largely unnoticed, but a celebration is in the works for December,
the 50th anniversary of the film's debut.
   Meanwhile, those who knew her are waiting curiously for the
publication of a ``Gone With the Wind'' sequel, something Miss
Mitchell herself had opposed.
   Stephens Mitchell opposed it too. But shortly before his death,
he authorized attorneys to go ahead with the sequel, knowing that a
flood of unauthorized versions was likely as soon as the copyright
on his sister's book expired in 2011.
   A Virginia author, Alexandra Ripley, was chosen to write the
sequel, which is due out next year.
   In a 1988 interview, Ms. Ripley acknowledged that Margaret
Mitchell fans are likely to view her efforts critically.
   ``This one will never be mine,'' she said. ``It's a foster
mother kind of thing. I am trying to prepare myself for a universal
hatred of what I'm going to do.''
