<UNK>Mitchell Heirs Pleased With Ruling in French Plaigiarism Suit</UNK>

   An attorney for Margaret Mitchell's heirs said he
was pleased with a Paris court's ruling that a French best-seller
plagiarized the classic ``Gone With the Wind,'' but said he plans
to appeal for more damages.
   The French court ruled Wednesday that Regine Deforges must pay
the Mitchell estate $333,000 in damages and interest because her
best-sellr ``The Blue Bicycle'' illegally pirated the Atlanta
author's book. The Mitchell heirs had sought $833,000 from Ms.
Deforges and her publisher.
   ``We are exceedingly pleased with the findings of the court as
to piracy,'' said Atlanta attorney Hal Clark, a former law partner
of Miss Mitchell's late brother, Stephens Mitchell, and an executor
of the ``Gone With the Wind'' estate.
   ``We are somewhat disappointed in the award of damages,
however,'' he added, saying he plans to appeal.
   Stephens Mitchell's son, Joe, accepted the news calmly.
   ``It sounds all right. We seem to have won the case,'' he said.
   Franck Spengler, president of the company that published Ms.
Deforges' book, said he and the author also would appeal. The
novelist was in West Germany and unavailable for comment, he said.
   ``We feel we're innocent,'' Spengler said Wednesday.
   ``The books are both great novels but they are very different.
... `The Blue Bicycle' is a historical novel smattered with
psychology and emotion while `Gone With the Wind' is a
psychological novel cloaked with history,'' he said.
   In a judgment issued by Judge Nicole Antoine, the court
concluded ``The Blue Bicycle'' constituted an ``illicit
reproduction'' of ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``Based on a comparative study of the two works, it is clear
that what Regine Deforges borrowed from Margaret Mitchell's work
and incorporated into `The Blue Bicycle' is perfectly identifiable
and relates to the most important elements of Ms. Mitchell's
novel,'' the statement said.
   ``The Blue Bicycle,'' which has sold millions of copies since it
was published in 1983 as the first part of a trilogy, is set during
the Nazi occupation of France.
   Its heroine, Lea Delmas, is the beautiful, headstrong daughter
of a southern vintner. Like Scarlett O'Hara, the beautiful,
headstrong daughter of a southern planter, she finds her carefree
youth interrupted by the horrors of war.
   Like Scarlett, Lea wants the one man she cannot have. Laurent
d'Argilat has married the sweet, fragile and morally upright
Camille, a character similar to Melanie Wilkes, wife of Scarlett's
unrequited love, Ashley Wilkes.
   Ms. Deforges' French-style Rhett Butler _ Francois Tavernier _
is a swarthy, cigar-smoking rogue who miraculously turns up
whenever Lea needs him.
   The case has been long and complicated because there are few
precedents. French law forbids plagiarism, but it does allow
pastiche, a centuries-old literary form defined as a ``humorous''
take-off or remake of a recognizable original text.
   Ms. Deforges repeatedly asserted that her novel was meant as a
pastiche, but the court rejected her argument, saying the
differences between the two works were ``undeniably secondary and
inoperative given the extent of their similarities.''
