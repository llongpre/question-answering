   Yes, "Gone With the Wind" fans, there is an alternative to
the much maligned new sequel to Margaret Mitchell's classic.
Unfortunately, you can't read it.
   So far, reviewers have almost universally panned Alexandra
Ripley's "Scarlett: the Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone
With the Wind," which landed in bookstores this week. Newsday
said it was "crude" and "phony, " USA Today advised fans to
re-read the original and the Washington Post headline was
"Frankly, It's Damnable."

   Ms. Ripley was chosen several years ago by the Mitchell
heirs to write a sequel -- even though one already existed.
Before Ms. Ripley came along, Anne Edwards was hired in the
mid-1970s by movie producers David Brown and Richard Zanuck
to write a sequel that would be the basis for a movie script.
The handful of people who read her resulting book, "Tara; The
Continuation of Gone With The Wind" thought it was quite
good, including Lisa Drew, then an editor at Doubleday. "I
was very impressed," says Ms. Drew. "She really caught
Mitchell's style and the plot was plausible."
   But MGM rejected the script and thus killed the book: The
Mitchell estate had demanded that the book only be published
as a movie tie-in, says Mr. Brown. Later, Ms. Mitchell's
heirs sued MGM to assert that the estate controlled all
rights, and won, eventually picking Ms. Ripley, best known as
a writer of genteel romances, to do the authorized sequel.
   Ms. Edwards was paid about $250,000 for her sequel. She
went on to write many successful books -- including a
recently reissued biography of Margaret Mitchell.
   Unfortunately, that book virtually assures that there will
be no tomorrow for her sequel to "Gone With The Wind." Says
Hal Clarke, an Atlanta attorney and one of three trustees for
the Mitchell estate: "The family didn't care for her
biography at all. She emphasized some minor things that give
a wrong impression."
   Laurence Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books Inc., which
paid $5 million for U.S. rights alone for Ms. Ripley's book,
says he feels bad for Ms. Edwards, though he hasn't read her
book. But he is more than happy with the sequel he's got. USA
Today graded it "A for Awful," to which Mr. Kirshbaum
replies: "Sales are E for excellent: Waldenbooks sold 24,000
copies in one day. We expect hardcover sales of 1.5 million
copies."
