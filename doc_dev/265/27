   Thousands of fans, many in antebellum costume,
turned out to re-create the festivities surrounding the premiere of
``Gone With the Wind'' on the 50th anniversary of the release of
the Civil War movie classic.
   Some of the original cast was on hand for the gala
``re-premiere'' Friday night, but the movie itself was the star of
the show.
   The crowd applauded everything, from the title as it swept
across the screen to the stars' names as the credits rolled.
   Andy Diskes of Peabody, Mass., who came dressed in a Confederate
uniform, didn't care that he had seen the movie many times before.
This time was special.
   ``I thought that by being here I could be part of its history,''
he said.
   Ten surviving cast members _ all had minor roles _ were on hand.
   Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes, sent a letter to
be read to the audience in which she said stars Clark Gable and
Vivien Leigh would live on through the film, and ``I'll be with you
too.''
   Gable, who played Rhett Butler, and Miss Leigh, who portrayed
Scarlett O'Hara, both died in the 1960s. Margaret Mitchell, the
Atlanta author whose Pulitzer Prize-winning novel became one of the
world's most popular movies, died in 1949.
   When the surviving cast members were introduced by talk show
host Larry King, the loudest applause went to Butterfly McQueen,
the child-voiced actress who played the slave Prissy.
   Miss McQueen was barred from the 1939 premiere, held in a
whites-only theater. But on Friday night, she entertained the crowd
with lines from her role and a song to the tune of the ``Tara''
theme.
   Fans from as far away as Australia came for the event, but the
crowd was far smaller than the hundreds of thousands who turned out
for the Dec. 15, 1939, premiere at Loews Grand Theatre.
   This time, only a few hundred people gathered in cold, cloudy
weather to watch a re-creation of the motorcade.
   And the parade didn't head for the Loews Grand, torn down after
it was gutted by fire in 1978. Its stand-in was the Fox Theatre, an
ornate 1920s movie palace restored in the 1970s.
   Before the screening, the cast members helped cut a huge cake in
the shape of the plantation Tara. Joining them was Daniel Selznick,
son of the late ``Gone With the Wind'' producer, David O. Selznick.
   Ted Turner, the media mogul who acquired the movie in 1985 when
he bought MGM-UA Entertainment Corp.'s huge film empire, had little
to say at the screening.
   But Thursday night, at an anniversary ball at the Georgia
International Convention and Trade Center, he had a quip for those
who disliked his practice of adding color to many classic
black-and-white movies.
   ``All I can say is, thank God they shot `Gone With the Wind' in
color,'' he said.
