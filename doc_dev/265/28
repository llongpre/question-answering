   ``Gone With the Wind'' turned 50 years old
Friday, but it will never age in the eyes of the fans who gathered
for a gala ``re-premiere'' of the blockbuster Civil War movie.
   ``It's part of our blood,'' said Kim Mills of New York, who
traveled South with his mother and sister to attend the week-long
celebration marking the anniversary of the movie's Dec. 15, 1939,
premiere.
   Butterfly McQueen, the child-voiced actress who played the slave
Prissy in the movie, didn't attend the premiere in 1939, when the
Loews was a whites-only theater. But she stole the show Friday
night at the Fox Theatre, entertaining the crowd with lines from
her role and a song to the tune of the ``Tara'' theme.
   Hers was the biggest applause when the surviving cast members
were introduced by talk show host Larry King, but the real star of
the show was the movie itself.
   The crowd applauded everything _ from the title as it swept
across the screen to the stars' names as the credits were rolled.
   Many of the fans came to the reception and screening dressed in
antebellum costumes.
   Mary Burleston of Amboy, Ill., wore her wedding dress, altered
with a hoop and green trim to resemble an 1860s ball gown. Her
friend, Michele Viola of Aurora, Ill., rented her hoop skirt from a
costume shop.
   ``They said it (antebellum attire) was optional, but we thought,
`Why not?''' said Ms. Viola, whose trip to Atlanta was a Christmas
gift from her aunt.
   Fans from as far away as Australia came for the event, but the
crowd was far smaller than the million or so who waited in the cold
to see Clark Cable and Vivien Leigh on that Friday night in 1939.
   Then, the crowd was so thick that one man perched on a street
sign for hours in hopes of catching a glimpse of the stars as they
passed in a 30-car motorcade on Peachtree Street to the Loews Grand
Theatre.
   Margaret Mitchell, the home-grown author whose Pulitzer
Prize-winning book became one of the world's most popular movies,
also rode in the parade down the street where she was raised.
   This time, only a few hundred people gathered in cold, cloudy
weather to watch a re-creation of the motorcade.
   And this time, only 10 minor cast members were in town for the
festivities. The two top stars both died in the 1960s, and Miss
Mitchell died in 1949.
   The parade didn't head for the Loews Grand either. It was torn
down after being gutted by fire in 1978. The theater's stand-in for
the ``re-premiere'' was the Fox, an ornate 1920s movie palace that
was restored in the 1970s.
   Ted Turner, the Atlanta media mogul who acquired the rights to
``Gone With the Wind'' in 1985 when he bought MGM-UA Entertainment
Corp.'s huge film library, appeared with the cast members at an
antebellum ball Thursday night at the Georgia International
Convention and Trade Center.
   Only about 1,500 of the 3,000 tickets to the ball were sold, but
there were plenty of would-be Scarlett O'Haras and Rhett Butlers in
the crowd. A replica of Tara, Scarlett's plantation home, decorated
the banquet area.
   Turner, whose colorizing of many classic black-and-white movies
has made him a controversial figure in the motion picture industry,
was dressed in a cream-colored frock coat.
   As he greeted the ball-goers, he quipped, ``All I can say is,
thank God they shot `Gone With the Wind' in color.''
