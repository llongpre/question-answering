   In a marketing marriage sure to make film purists
wince, a Japanese company is putting Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett
Butler on a bottle of wine.
   It's not the first time the characters from ``Gone With The
Wind'' have appeared outside of the printed page or silver screen,
and most U.S. fans of the Old South epic probably will never see a
bottle of ``Gone With The Wind'' wine.
   The new line of wines is to be sold only in Japan, under a
license granted by the owners of the movie, Atlanta-based Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., to the Japanese media conglomerate
Fujisankei Communications International Inc.
   Still, some people in the land of cotton wish this wine would
soon be forgotten.
   ``Don't you think it cheapens the book and the movie?'' asked
Hal Clarke, the lawyer for ``Gone With The Wind'' author Margaret
Mitchell's estate.
   For Fujisankei officials, the wine represents a chance to cash
in on Japan's love of American popular culture and the nation's
ever-increasing affection for wine.
   Katherine Melchior Ray, senior account manager with Fujisankei,
said the ``Gone With the Wind'' tie-in was a natural.
   ``We're always looking for high-quality, unusual American
products to sell in Japan,'' she said Monday. ``We see a demand in
Japan for more beers and wine. With the interest in fine wines and
beer and interest in all American media, we figured why not put the
two together?''
   The line of California wines was to be unveiled today at a
reception at New York's 21 Club. The wine label features the
familiar ``Gone With the Wind'' movie poster, with stars Clark
Gable and Vivien Leigh embracing against a backdrop of Atlanta
burning.
   Ms. Ray said TBS officials initially were reluctant to slap
``Gone With the Wind'' labels on wine bottles. TBS agreed, she
said, because ``we took a lot of care to show this was going to
maintain the prestige of the movie and encourage the beauty of the
scenes in `Gone With The Wind.'''
   TBS receives ``several calls a month'' from people wanting to
use ``Gone With the Wind'' in some way, said Lois Sloane, TBS' vice
president for licensing and merchandising.
   The requests are screened carefully and only those that properly
honor the film are granted licensing agreements, Ms. Sloane said
Monday from her New York office.
   ``We care very much about `Gone With The Wind,''' Ms. Sloane
said.
   Most of the products approved for licensing are geared to
adults, she said _ things such as commemorative plates, stationery
and figurines. Items such as toys and hard liquor have been
rejected, she said.
   TBS Chairman Ted Turner's fondness for ``Gone With The Wind'' is
well known. It is shown daily at the movie theater at Turner's CNN
Center in downtown Atlanta.
   Terms of the deal with Fujisankei were not disclosed.
   Attorney Clarke said the appearance of ``Gone With The Wind''
wine was unexpected. ``This came as quite a surprise to us,'' he
said.
   Clarke said he intended to examine the agreement to make sure
``it's on firm ground,'' but doubted he had any legal grounds to
oppose it. He said the estate has not objected to marketing schemes
when they ``promote the sale of the movie or the book.''
   The wine will go on sale in Japan May 1 and will cost between
$11 and $17 a bottle, compared to about $8 a bottle for most
California wines sold there. Currently most wine sold in Japan is
French.
   About 10,000 cases of ``Gone With the Wind,'' to be distributed
by Sanraku, are being shipped initially.
   Atlanta historian Franklin Garrett, who knew Miss Mitchell as a
young writer, expressed amusement at the idea of a ``Gone With the
Wind'' wine.
   ``I don't know _ `Gone With the Wind' wine sounds pretty good,
though it probably hasn't got the remotest connection to `Gone With
the Wind,''' Garrett said.
   ``I guess it's a compliment to the book,'' he added. ``But if
you get to using it too much for things other than the book, it
might lose its distinctiveness.''
