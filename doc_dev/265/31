   HOPEDALE, Ohio (AP ) _ Come home, Clark Gable. All is forgiven.
   Twenty-nine years after his death, the ``King of Hollywood'' has
finally won back the hearts of those who live in his hometown.
   Gable _ at least his legend _ will be the guest of honor this
weekend as Harrison County and some stars of ``Gone With the Wind''
commemorate the film's 50th anniversary by re-enacting the famous
Twelve Oaks barbecue scene and attending a screening of a restored
version of the movie.
   The 850 residents of this eastern Ohio village, where Gable was
born Feb. 1, 1901, haven't always regarded him as a favorite son.
The gawky, gap-toothed, big-eared boy never returned to the county
after he moved about 80 miles northwest to Akron in 1917.
   ``Most folks around here were angry because he never came back,''
said Michael Cope, president of the Clark Gable Foundation. ``But
recently, we're seeing a real turnaround. There is no longer any of
that resentment we felt even after we started honoring him on his
birthday in 1984.''
   Frances Jackson, an 86-year-old Hopedale native, said she has
forgiven Gable for never returning. She has become a local celebrity
herself because she once rejected Gable's request for a birthday
kiss.
   ``He said `This is my 16th birthday. Do you want to be the first
one to kiss me?' I said, no I did not,'' Mrs. Jackson said.
   ``He had a real way with the girls. Oh, he had lots and lots of
girlfriends. But not me,'' she said, smiling. ``My father would have
killed me.''
   Harrison County has been celebrating Gable's birthday each year
since 1984, hoping that fascination with the actor and his films
will give a boost to an economy hurt by a decline in coal mining,
said Cope, who also is county treasurer. The county's unemployment
rate was 10.8 percent in April.
   Other famous native sons simply don't have the drawing power.
   John Bingham, credited as the author of the 14th Amendment to the
Constitution, was born in Cadiz, 10 miles southwest of Hopedale. And
Gen. George Custer is better know for his last stand at Little
Bighorn than his first breath in New Rumley, about 10 miles to the
northwest.
   A granite monument honoring Gable was erected in 1986 at the site
of his home in Cadiz, where his family moved when he was a child. By
coincidence, the house was razed in 1960 _ the year Gable died.
   The Gable Foundation hopes to raise enough money through special
events and corporate donations to build and operate a museum-theater
to display Gable memorabilia and show his films.
   The three-day commemoration of the film's golden anniversary
begins Friday with an auction of memorabilia at the Alameda Inn, a
roadhouse-turned-restaurant that Gable was believed to have
frequented in his younger days.
   Items to be sold include an original program from the movie's
1939 premiere, a sepia movie still of Gable and Vivien Leigh as
Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, and a first-issue postage stamp
honoring Margaret Mitchell, author of ``Gone With the Wind,'' signed
by Olivia de Havilland, who portrayed the long-suffering Melanie
Wilkes.
   On Saturday, residents and stars from the movie _ including Fred
Crane, who played one of the Tarleton twins _ will don Civil War-era
attire to re-enact the barbecue scene at an American Legion hall.
   Also during the weekend, Crane and other stars will be asked to
leave hand imprints and signatures in cement. They include Butterfly
McQueen, who played Prissy, the maid; Cammie King Conlon, who
portrayed Bonnie Blue, the ill-fated daughter of Rhett and Scarlett;
and Patrick Curtis, who appeared in the film as an infant.
   Cope said Danny Selznick, son of the film's producer, David O.
Selznick, plans an appearance.
   The reunion of the stars ends Sunday with a showing of a restored
print of the film in Wheeling, W.Va., 25 miles to the southeast.
