Photo, The two women who brought Scarlett O'Hara into the world: Hattie 
McDaniel, above, played Scarlett's mammy in the 1939 movie, "Gone With the 
Wind." Here she is photographed at the beginning of her stage career at age 15 
in 1910 (see review of her biography on this page). Margaret Mitchell, author 
of the novel, looks capable of playing her heroine in the 1920 photograph at 
right. From "The Art of Gone With the Wind: The Making of a Legend" by Judy 
Cameron and Paul J. Christman (Prentice Hall Press: $29.95), celebrating the 
50th anniversary of the film.
