Charge It With GWTW: Scarlett O'Hara's line in the classic "Gone With the Wind" 
-- "Rhett, you never give me credit for anything" -- may no longer hold true. 
To mark the 50th anniversary of the legendary movie and the eve of its 
re-premiere, Rhett Butler is finally "giving credit" -- with a Gone With the 
Wind MasterCard. Issued by the Citizens and Southern National Bank in Atlanta, 
the cards will be reissued every two years with a different scene reproduced 
from movie stills. The four-card collection will consist of a 1989-91 50th 
anniversary issue with a specially designed commemorative symbol, and scenes of 
Scarlett and her beloved Tara, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, and a Rhett and 
Scarlet profile.
