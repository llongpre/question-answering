   Television rights have been sold for "Scarlett: the Sequel
to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind," the bestseller
published in September by Warner Books.
   Producer Robert Halmi, whose production company RHI
Entertainment Inc. also produced "Lonesome Dove," said he
bought the rights from the estate of Margaret Mitchell for
"well over $5 million." Mr. Halmi said CBS Inc., has ordered
an eight-hour "Scarlett" miniseries, and he plans to spend
even more on this production than on the acclaimed "Dove."

   Mr. Halmi said he purchased all television, cable and
video rights worldwide, plus rights to make a theatrical
motion picture in Europe. "The estate didn't want to auction
rights for a regular movie in the U.S., because they worry
about competing head-to-head with the original movie," said
Mr. Halmi. He said he'll be looking for "a fresh face" to
play Scarlett, and that he expects the mini-series to be
broadcast in early 1993.
