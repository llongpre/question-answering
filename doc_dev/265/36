<LEADPARA>  In a deal that stunned Hollywood, CBS and a group of American and European
investors Sunday bought the television rights to "Scarlett," the sequel to
"Gone With the Wind," for a record $8 million -- the most ever paid for rights
to a book.;   The buyers said "Scarlett" would be broadcast as a miniseries,
probably in 1993, and that it would feature an unknown actress as Scarlett,
just as the then-unknown Vivien Leigh was cast in the 1930s to play the
heroine in "Gone With the Wind."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The part of Rhett Butler will be played by an established actor, said
Robert Halmi, the New York-based chairman of RHI Entertainment Inc. who is one
of CBS' partners in the deal.;   Halmi said he hopes to spend $30 million on
the miniseries. Alexandra Ripley's book, for which Warner Books paid $4.94
million, has been at the top of the New York Times best-seller list since Oct.
13 despite generally poor reviews. It is believed to have sold about 5 million
copies worldwide.;   Several Hollywood executives and agents said the highest
price previously paid for the rights to a book was about $2.5 million for Gay
Talese's "Thy Neighbor's Wife," which was never made into a movie.;   One of
the most powerful agents in Hollywood, who insisted on anonymity, said $8
million was "an amazing price" and "far too expensive." The agent added,
"You're only buying a title.";   But Roger Davis, executive vice president of
William Morris, disagreed.;   "It's not just a book. It's an event," he said.
"There's no limit monetarily on what a piece like this is worth. What it's
worth is what it brings in the marketplace."  </TEXT>
