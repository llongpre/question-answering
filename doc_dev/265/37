   NEW YORK _ In 1939, as Britain and France challenged the German
war machine, and Admiral Richard Byrd made his third expedition to
the icy vastness of Antarctica, America went to the movies. And oh,
what movies they were: ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``The Wizard of Oz,''
``Wuthering Heights'' and ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' were
among the year's screen treats.

   NEW YORK _ Rhett Butler with a wide, painted-on mustache,
meandering eyebrows, eye glasses and a cigar? Well, if author
Margaret Mitchell had her way and had been really serious about it,
it would have been Groucho Marx who swept Miss Scarlett up all those
stairs for a taste of Southern lust instead of Clark Gable. As one
of the most popular movies of all time, ``Gone With the Wind'' is
awash with such trivia nuggets.
