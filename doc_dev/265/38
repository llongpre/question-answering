Compared to the 1939 Atlanta premiere of "Gone With the Wind" -- when Georgia's 
governor declared a three-day holiday and stars such as Clark Gable and Vivien 
Leigh swept in by train to attend all-night balls -- the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art's 50th anniversary celebration of the film was a modest affair. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 10 of the original cast of more than 60 are still alive, and most of 
the survivors turned out. Instead of dances and Mardi Gras-style parades, the 
celebrants Saturday night were content to eat jambalaya and sip mint juleps 
under heat lamps inside a courtyard on Wilshire Boulevard. The hit of the event 
were nine Pennsylvania housewives who arrived wearing exact replicas of 
Scarlett O'Hara's dresses. 
</P>
<P>
But the stories shared by some of the film's survivors, at the celebration and 
in interviews last week, evoked the memories of that 1939 premiere, probably 
the most eagerly awaited in American film history. Their anecdotes restore as 
much luster to the film as Turner Entertainment's lab technicians, who 
painstakingly re-created the movie's fading colors and sound track in the 1950s 
print screened Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors talked about Leigh's last-minute success in securing the most 
coveted role in Hollywood at that time, that of Scarlett O'Hara, and the 
British actress' slavish devotion to the film's first director, George Cukor. 
They talked about Gable's almost casual attitude toward the film -- the 
opposite demeanor of his co-star -- and his annoyance at Cukor's concentration 
on the female characters. After filming was well under way, producer David O. 
Selznick fired Cukor and brought in Victor Fleming, a man's man and a good 
buddy of Gable's. 
</P>
<P>
"Both women (Leigh and Olivia de Havilland) were bereft when Cukor left," 
recalled Ann Rutherford, 71, who played Scarlett's sister Careen. "They went to 
his house at night (after Fleming replaced him). He would feed them a light 
dinner and rehearse them until they were brainless. . . . If not for Cukor, I 
doubt that you would have seen those hair-raising performances from these 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Crane, who played one of the Tarleton twins, was so young and naive when 
he landed his part in "Gone With the Wind," his first film, that he caught 
himself calling the director "Mr. Zukor." Crane, 70, later left the movies and 
went into broadcasting, where he was a regular radio personality on KFAC. Rand 
Brooks, who played the smitten Charles Hamilton, Scarlett's first husband, 
hated his part so much that he voted for "Of Mice and Men" in the Academy Award 
race that year. "It was an asinine role," he said. "That role hurt me in some 
ways, it sort of typecast me after that." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, 70, turned out for the reception, but he said he didn't intend to sit 
through the entire screening. "I'm the biggest laugh in the show -- maybe 
Butterfly gets more -- and that hurts," said Brooks, who left show business 23 
years ago to run a private ambulance company. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfly McQueen wasn't thrilled about her character, either. "Prissy is 
stupid and backward and lazy, " said McQueen, whose voice is still just as 
high-pitched as the teen-age slave she portrayed. But the role has garnered 
McQueen plenty of public attention at every "Gone With the Wind" anniversary. 
The 78-year-old actress arrived at Saturday's event passing out pre-written 
autographs from a manila envelope, and received a standing ovation before the 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
But as the survivors of "Gone With the Wind" talk about themselves and their 
colleagues on the set, the conversation somehow always circles back to one man 
-- the obsessive, arrogant, brilliant perfectionist David O. Selznick. 
</P>
<P>
"I was crazy about him," said Brooks. "But he drove some people crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make 'em like that anymore," he added, a bit wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
"This was Selznick's baby," said Rutherford. "His word was law, and woe betide 
any actor who interjected an extra if, and, or but." 
</P>
<P>
When Selznick appeared one day in the wardrobe room, Rutherford thought she was 
doing the producer a favor when she lifted her skirt and suggested that muslin 
petticoats would serve just as well as the expensive lace she was wearing under 
her Southern Belle dress. 
</P>
<P>
Selznick wasn't impressed. "He fixed his beady eyes on me," she recalled, "and 
said, 'You are not to forget that you are the daughter of one of the richest 
plantation owners in Georgia.' " 
</P>
<P>
At another point during the filming, a Selznick assistant picked up Rutherford 
and Evelyn Keyes, who played Scarlett's other sister Suellen, at 3 in the 
morning and drove them to a cotton field 40 miles east of Hollywood. The women 
were told to start picking. When Rutherford asked why, she was told that 
Selznick "wants your hands to be thoroughly bitten up" by the time the scene 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Selznick's memos were legendary, and Rutherford is proud to say that she 
prompted one of them. The young actress cornered Selznick on a train and 
insisted that the women in the film had to let their eye-brows grow in. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's description of "the raven-wing sweep of Scarlett's eye-brows," said 
Rutherford, was in danger because the studios routinely altered their 
actresses' natural looks, which inevitably included a severe eyebrow plucking. 
</P>
<P>
A minor detail, perhaps. But just the sort to provoke a flurry of paper from 
Selznick's office. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford said she sees red every time she hears talk of a remake of "Gone 
With the Wind." "If it's not broken, don't fix it," she said. Judging by the 
enthusiastic response of Saturday's audience, the film fans seem to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Goya, a Rembrandt," Crane said dramatically in his best radio voice. 
"It has the ineffable essence of something that's going to live forever."
