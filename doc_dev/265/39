<TEXT>
   Millicent Miller, who worked as Vivien
Leigh's stand-in during filming of ``Gone With the Wind,'' has
died. She was 81.
   Mrs. Miller died Tuesday. The cause of death wasn't given.
   She lived most of her life in Stillwater, except for nine years
she spent in California.
   In California, she joined the Screen Actors Guild and was asked
to interview for the job as Miss Leigh's stand-in for ``Gone With
the Wind.'' She was hired from a group of more than 300 applicants.
   She appeared in the movie as Scarlett O'Hara hiding under a
bridge while a wagon passes overhead. And it was her hand that
pulled a turnip from the ground after the ruination of Scarlett's
plantation Tara, and her hand that drew a revolver from a drawer
before Scarlett shoots a Union soldier.
   Mrs. Miller is survived by her husband, Jimmy ``Pete'' Miller, a
daughter and granddaughter.
   Services are scheduled for Thursday.
