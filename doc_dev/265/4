<TEXT>  By Alexandra Ripley; Warner Books, 823 pp., $24.95; SOUTHERN DAUGHTER: The
Life; of Margaret Mitchell; By Darden Asbury Pyron; Oxford, 533 pp., $24.95;
Matthews, a managing editor for West magazine, grew up in Mississippi, where
he first read "Gone With the Wind" at the age of 14 and thought it was the
great American novel.; ALL a reviewer of "Scarlett" has to do is answer two
questions:;   Is it any good, and does she get him?;   But before we get to
that, let's reflect on why there's a sequel to "Gone With the Wind." At the
end of Margaret Mitchell's novel, Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler has
figured out that she loves Rhett Butler, who's just left her, and doesn't
really love Ashley Wilkes, who's just become a widower. It's really quite a
good ending, giving Scarlett an ironic comeuppance. But it's the sort of
dilemma that occurs in the middle chapters of most of the books that have
imitated "GWTW.";   There was bound to be a sequel eventually: The copyright
on "Gone With the Wind" expires in 2011. The owners of the copyright, the
heirs to Mitchell's estate, figured they'd better cash in before the book
winds up in public domain and everyone can get their hands on Mitchell's
characters. So they hired Alexandra Ripley, the author of such ersatz "GWTW"
clones as "Charleston" and "New Orleans Legacy," to produce the official
sequel.;   Catching the wind; Now, I'm not one of those who think Ripley is
desecrating graves and violating temples by cobbling up a sequel to "Gone With
the Wind." Margaret Mitchell's book is a good read, with an epic conflict in
the background and a romantic dilemma in the foreground. It's terrific pop
fiction. But is it anything more than that?;   It has long had admirers who
think it is. Darden Asbury Pyron, a history professor at Florida International
University, is one of them. His new biography of Mitchell is a doggedly
dutiful attempt to take Mitchell seriously as a writer. He digs tirelessly
into her family history for the roots of the novel, and explores her childhood
writing and her work as an Atlanta journalist as if they bore the seeds of
genius. He combs "Gone With the Wind" for themes and motifs related to
Mitchell's life: Among other things, he says, the book is about the
relationship of mothers and daughters, Ellen and Scarlett, Scarlett and
Bonnie, Grandmother Robillard and Ellen, Mammy and Scarlett, Dilcey and
Prissy. So naturally he finds the model for Rhett Butler in Mitchell's
mother.;   Pyron's biography is occasionally provocative, and it may well be
the definitive account of the novel's origins. On the other hand, it's more
than a little sloppy in some details: Pyron refers to the senator from South
Carolina as "Strom Thurman" -- it's Thurmond -- and to the novella by Oscar
Wilde as "A Portrait of Dorian Gray" -- it's "The Picture of Dorian Gray."
Mainly, it's a book for "GWTW" fanatics -- of which, to judge only from the
sales of "Scarlett," there seem to be millions -- and not for the general
reader or the skeptic.;   I side with the skeptics about the status of "GWTW"
as literature, and particularly with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose critique of
the novel is quoted in Pyron's book: "There are no new characters, new
techniques, new observations -- none of the elements that make literature --
especially no new examination into human emotions," Fitzgerald wrote. "But on
the other hand it is interesting, surprisingly honest, consistent and
workmanlike throughout, and I felt no contempt for it but only a certain pity
for those who consider it the supreme achievement of the human mind.";   To
answer the first of those questions at the top of this review: No one is going
to consider "Scarlett" the supreme achievement of the human mind. A lot of
people are going to feel contempt for it.;   More than romance; "Gone With the
Wind" was driven by Margaret Mitchell's desire to tell a story. She had
something to say, even if some of it was nonsense, about the effects of the
Civil War and Reconstruction on a generation of upper-class Georgians. For
Mitchell, history wasn't just something to wrap the romance in. And she really
wasn't interested in whether Scarlett got Rhett. Pyron suggests that she
originally planned to end the novel with Rhett's "I don't give a damn," as if
Mitchell herself didn't give a damn about what Scarlett would do.;  
Unfortunately, that's the only thing Ripley is interested in -- aside from,
obviously, money. Her whole sequel is about Scarlett's obsession with Rhett.
Ripley dutifully tries to work in some history by packing Scarlett off to
Ireland at the height of the Fenian movement and Parnell's crusade for Home
Rule, but she's not really interested in it. It's only a plot mechanism.;  
Not that "Scarlett" has a plot. Instead, it just has a lot of incidents:
Scarlett pursues Rhett to Charleston. Scarlett conquers Charleston society.
Scarlett and Rhett nearly drown. They make love. He leaves. Scarlett goes to
Savannah and meets her O'Hara cousins. Scarlett goes to Ireland with guns for
the Fenians packed among her petticoats. Rhett divorces her and remarries.
Scarlett buys and restores an Irish estate. Scarlett has Rhett's baby.
Scarlett conquers Anglo-Irish society. Ashley proposes and Scarlett turns him
down. Scarlett gets engaged to a wicked lord. The peasants attack Scarlett's
mansion . . .;   Paid by the word?; Outlined like that, "Scarlett" may sound
like a promising page-turner. But it isn't; these incidents are dragged out
over 823 tedious pages. Even though she'll rake in her share of the $4.7
million Warner Books paid for the rights to "Scarlett," Ripley writes as if
she's being paid by the word: "He opened the door to the street. Before she
could say a word, he was gone. The door swung slowly closed behind him." It
takes her 200 pages to wrap up all the loose ends and straggling characters
from "Gone With the Wind." Then it's off to Charleston, and a whole new set of
characters, most of whom disappear after 100 pages, when Scarlett moves on to
Savannah and another hundred pages of mostly irrelevant incident. The book is
half over before Scarlett gets to Ireland, where the real story begins. By
that time, most readers won't give a damn, either.;   Furthermore, Ripley has
undermined her central character. Mitchell's Scarlett may have been a bitch,
but she was never a bore. Ripley's Scarlett ceases to be a bitch: In Ireland,
she becomes "The O'Hara of Ballyhara"; everyone loves her; she loves her
child; she gives up wearing corsets! She becomes a colossal bore.;   Part of
the problem is that Ripley has no one to play her off against. According to
the flackery, Ripley reread "Gone With the Wind" six times in preparation for
her sequel. She would have done better to read Fielding and Jane Austen,
Dickens and Thackeray, and learn from them, as Mitchell certainly did, that
novels need plot and characters need foils. In "GWTW" Melanie's virtue and
selflessness highlighted Scarlett's pragmatism and egocentricity. Mammy was
Scarlett's Jiminy Cricket-style conscience. The other servants, such as Pork
and Dilcey and Uncle Peter, as well as the neighbors at Tara and in Atlanta,
served as a chorus, their judgment of Scarlett sometimes ironically differing
from our own. Even Belle Watling, the whore with a heart of gold, served to
reveal Scarlett's heart of ice. Stock characters all, but Mitchell uses them
well.;   Dropped characters, missed chances; Ripley fumbles all of this.
Melanie is dead, and Ripley provides no one else as a norm against which
Scarlett's behavior may be judged. She kills off Mammy on Page 25 and sends
Prissy, Pork, Dilcey and Uncle Peter into retirement. She never bothers to
account for Belle Watling, despite Belle's well-established relationship with
Rhett and hints in Mitchell's book that they may have had a child. Instead,
Ripley wastes pages on Tony Fontaine, a minor character from the first book
who seems to be a potential suitor for Scarlett until he disappears
completely.;   Is there anything to be said for "Scarlett"? I suppose one
could praise Ripley for eliminating the racism that mars "Gone With the Wind."
Mitchell never presents slavery as an evil; she seems to think of it as an
excellent system for training servants. She regarded blacks as at best
childlike noble savages. But she did create memorable black characters, who
serve her plot well. Ripley avoids charges of racism by eliminating all black
characters except Scarlett's servant, a new character named Pansy, who seems
to be there because Scarlett has to have a maid -- and perhaps because Ripley
couldn't resist a joke: In Mitchell's manuscript, Scarlett was initially Pansy
O'Hara.;   On the other hand, Ripley's novel is full of Irish characters who
are nearly as offensively stereotyped as Mitchell's blacks: They're a
relentlessly cheery but occasionally hot-tempered lot who do little but sing
"The Wearing o' the Green" and dance reels and blather endlessly about
leprechauns and banshees.;   No one expected "Scarlett" to be as good as "Gone
With the Wind." But it could have been fun; it could have been exciting; it
could have made you laugh and cry. But Ripley's book just slogs from its
lugubrious beginning, Melanie's funeral, to its ludicrous ending, wherein, to
answer the other question, yes, she gets him. Frankly . . . (box)  </TEXT>
