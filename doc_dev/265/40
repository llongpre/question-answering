</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millicent Miller, who worked as Vivien Leigh's stand-in during filming of "Gone 
With the Wind," has died. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Miller died Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death wasn't given. 
</P>
<P>
She lived most of her life in Stillwater, except for nine years she spent in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In California, she joined the Screen Actors Guild and was asked to interview 
for the job as Miss Leigh's stand-in for "Gone With the Wind." She was hired 
from a group of more than 300 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared in the movie as Scarlett O'Hara hiding under a bridge while a 
wagon passes overhead. And it was her hand that pulled a turnip from the ground 
after the ruination of Scarlett's plantation Tara, and her hand that drew a 
revolver from a drawer before Scarlett shoots a Union soldier. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Miller is survived by her husband, Jimmy (Pete) Miller, a daughter and 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled for Thursday.
