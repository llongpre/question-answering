   The Soviet Union is looking to the West for
economic ideas, and an American media mogul says it should look to
the Deep South for inspiration to carry out changes.
   ``The spirit of Scarlett O'Hara is what the Russian people need
right now,'' Ted Turner said Friday night before introducing the
film ``Gone With The Wind'' to a Soviet audience.
   ``Because they're going through a huge transition, they have to
do like she did (and say) `With God as my witness, I'll never be
hungry again,' and go to work to rebuild their country with a new
economic system. You can't sit around ... moaning and groaning
about the days that are gone.''
   The Soviet debut of the 1939 epic had all the glitz of a
Hollywood opening - popping flashbulbs, furs and limousines.
   Movie fans lined up for at least two hours for the chance to pay
15 rubles, $25 at the official exchange rate. The average monthly
paycheck is 250 rubles.
   After the box office sold out, a couple dozen Soviets began
offering to scalp their seats for 25 rubles each.
   The film began an indefinite engagement in Moscow under the
sponsorship of a British-Soviet venture and Turner, whose Cable
News Network and Goodwill Games are already known to the Soviets.
   A Red Army band played outside the 2,500-seat Oktyabr theater
and moviegoers were treated to a yellow champagne-lookalike before
the opening. The VIPs got the real stuff - with caviar - behind a
guarded door.
   Hundreds of people jammed the sidewalk in front of the theater
on one of Moscow's main thoroughfares for a chance to view what
Turner called the American equivalent of Tolstoy's ``War and
Peace,'' another tale of lives torn asunder by a great war.
   The film retained the original soundtrack with Russian-language
subtitles.
   ``Gone With The Wind'' is set during the Civil War, the same
years in which serfdom was abolished in czarist Russia.
   In its review of the film, the Soviet news agency Tass said ``it
will turn the attention of our contemporaries to the beauty of
noble feelings.''
   Soviets seem to crave anything foreign, particularly American,
whether noble or banal. The lines outside ``Gone with the Wind''
were similar to those at the McDonald's and Pizza Hut restaurants
that opened this year in Moscow.
   Formal black-tie attire was optional for this premiere; the
movie's organizers guessed that in a country where a sale of tennis
shoes can cause a near riot, most people had never even seen a
dinner jacket up close.
   But many Soviet guests dressed snazzily for the occasion. Some
wore Italian suits and formal gowns. Others were draped in furs and
silk of the sort unseen in ordinary Soviet stores.
   Once inside, the Soviets could buy an English-language biography
of Vivien Leigh, who played the inimitable Scarlett in the film, or
a small, 60-ruble bottle of French perfume packaged for the
premiere and called ``Scarlett.''
   Proceeds were to go to an anti-AIDS benefit sponsored by the
liberal weekly magazine Ogonyok.
   The Soviet-British Creative Association, the joint-venture that
organized the showing, says the film will travel to other Soviet
cities after Moscow.
   Turner, whose MGM Film Library owns the rights to the film, came
to Moscow with actress Jane Fonda. Fonda, a fitness fanatic, on
Thursday led about 700 Soviet women in a jog around the Kremlin.
