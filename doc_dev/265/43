Question: Now that I've been invited to a golden anniversary party for "Gone 
With the Wind," I'm interested in the pattern for the Scarlett O'Hara barbecue 
dress you wrote about some time ago. Is it still available? Where? I would 
really prefer the green velvet drapery dress, but if I remember correctly that 
famous gown is not available. Can you help? -- W.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The green velvet dress Scarlett made from the portieres at Tara -- 
arguably one of the most famous movie dresses of all time and the only one to 
figure in the plot -- is now available in pattern form. 
</P>
<P>
This screen gem comes to you from the folks who brought you Scarlett's barbecue 
dress, which is still available for $27. According to Janet Burgess of Amazon 
Drygoods, 2218 E. 11th St., Davenport, Iowa 52803, the dress follows the 
original Walter Plunkett design so faithfully it requires the same 31 yards of 
green velvet. The multisize pattern (Sizes 10-20) is priced at $29.75 plus $2 
for shipping, and it represents the 750th pattern in Burgess' "Patterns from 
Historie" collection.

Ready-made hoops and hoop patterns also are available, and a kit for the hat is 
in the works. Burgess says that the kit, which is not yet priced, includes a 
buckram hat form and the same variety of feathers and fringe used in the 
original. About the only things that will not be authentic, says Burgess, are 
the chicken feet Plunkett used in the front and back of the original hat.

"Ours are made of rubber," she reports, adding that her next "Gone With the 
Wind" pattern will be Rhett Butler's frock coat, which she hopes to have ready 
next year.

Q: My daughter gave me a very expensive sequin dress with lots of pearls and 
crystal beads. I want it to last for years as I can't afford to replace it 
myself, and would like to know how to care for it. I put it on a hanger, and my 
daughter said I should fold it and lay it in a plastic box. I followed her 
instructions, but the box made it sweat so I took it out and put it back on the 
hanger. What do I do now? -- I.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: Take it off the hanger immediately! This can cause stretching and sagging 
and will put undue stress on the fabric at the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
You were right to take your dress out of the plastic box, as the moisture would 
eventually have promoted mildew and fabric deterioration. Fabrics must breathe.

If you would like to receive a free brochure telling exactly how to preserve 
your gown, write to Jerry Goldstone, Museum Textile Cleaners Inc., 19343 
Londelius St., Northridge, Calif. 91324. Goldstone does work for the costume 
and textile curators at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. His brochure is 
also valuable for brides-to-be interested in preserving their gowns after the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Here's one tip: "Never seal the box in which the gown is placed. It should be 
checked after cleaning and then periodically inspected and refolded to prevent 
the accumulation of fold marks." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstone also recommends storage in acid-free boxes, using acid-free tissue 
paper. He sells such boxes (40-by-18-by-6 inches) for $25.
