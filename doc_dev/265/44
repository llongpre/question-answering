   The nation got its first big dose of inflation
this year as wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent
in March, the government said Friday. The report sent new tremors
through financial markets already shaken by a worsening U.S. trade
deficit.
   The Labor Department's producer price index rose 0.6 percent
last month, marking the biggest increase since April 1987 and more
than erasing a 0.2 percent decline in February.
   Falling energy and food prices that had been keeping a lid on
inflationary pressures shot upwards in March, as did wholesale
prices for a wide marketbasket of other consumer goods and capital
equipment.

   As inevitable as death and taxes, procrastinators and folks
simply waiting to pay at the last minute made their annual trek to
the post office Friday to deposit their 1040 forms.
   ``This happens every year,'' said John Tobias, mail supervisor
at the Willkes-Barre, Pa., post office.
   ``I think it's terrible that people have to wait for the last
minute,'' Tobias said. ``People call you today and ask you at the
last minute if you have tax forms in your office. And we don't.''

   American companies here say they're
caught in the middle of President Reagan's new economic sanctions
and may have to close if they're not allowed to resume payments to
Panama's government.
   Eastman Kodak Co. gave its workforce in Panama a 15-day paid
furlough because of the problems in doing business, a company
spokesman said Friday.
   Another company has given its employees ``collective vacations''
since Reagan froze all U.S. payments to the Panamian government on
April 8, in an attempt to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
relinquish power.

   A decision to temporarily bar federal
researchers from implanting brain tissue from aborted fetuses into
patients with Parkinson's disease focused renewed attention Friday
on ethical questions involving the emerging technique.
   The first reported use of the experimental procedure was in
January when surgeons in Mexico City said they had injected tissue
from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two Parkinson's
sufferers. The researchers said the results were promising.
   Researchers in Sweden also have reported using a similar
technique, but there have been no documented instances of it being
done on humans in the United States.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's controversial
social welfare legislation is stirring the fiercest opposition she
has encountered since her re-election last June.
   The resistance is coming not just from the opposition, but from
rank-and-file lawmakers within her own Conservative Party, who on
Thursday night staged their biggest back-bench revolt since June.
   Twenty-eight of the 376 Tories in Parliament voted against the
government's decision to end free dental checkups and eye
examinations.

   Eighty young people boarded buses Friday to
escape _ at least for the 10 days of their mountain retreat _ the
turfs of the gangs that bring violence and drugs to their urban
neighborhoods.
   ``The thing I want to get out of this is to better my life,''
15-year-old Michael Williams said as he waited to board one of the
three buses going to the Pocono Mountains in northeastern
Pennsylvania.
   Nearly all the 15- to 20-year-olds taking part in the ``Youth at
Risk'' program have been suspended from school at some point, and
about 30 are serious gang members, said Clinton Terrell, director
of community outreach and enrollment for the program.

   In a world fascinated by computers and
semiconductors, there's still a place for the serious consideration
of abominable snowmen, frog showers and reincarnation.
   It can be found in a little-known magazine named for an American
journalist who researched the inexplicable ``just to knock holes in
the smug orthodoxy of the scientists of his age,'' said Paul
Seiveking, a co-editor.
   Fortean Times, published in London, caters to readers who think
there just might be something to the hollow Earth theory, crying
statues and close encounters of any kind.

   For 50 years people have wondered: Did Rhett
Butler and Scarlett O'Hara ever get back together, or was it all
over for the tempestuous lovers of ``Gone With the Wind'' when
Rhett walked out the door.
   Margaret Mitchell never told, and now the answer is up to
Alexandra Ripley, a Virginia author chosen by Miss Mitchell's
estate to write the sequel to the Civil War-era epic.
   Ms. Ripley isn't saying what she'll do, but her novel appears
certain to be a multimillion-dollar production that the
luxury-loving Scarlett would have appreciated.

   Lawrence Buzalsky stopped at the Horse
Around Bar to buy a frozen pizza, but he got a taste of history and
a gander at the U.S. Constitution before heading home with his
dinner.
   ``Who built that?'' Buzalsky asked, circling a traveling exhibit
the state put together to celebrate the 200th birthday of the U.S.
Constitution. ``There's a lot of reading.''
   The Horse Around Bar, one of two businesses in this prairie
ranching town, is playing host to the four-sided display through
Monday, because there is no other place for it in the county.
