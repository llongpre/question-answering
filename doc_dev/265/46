   The black bonnet worn by Vivien Leigh as the
tempestuous Scarlett O'Hara in ``Gone With The Wind'' will be
auctioned this week, the auction house said Sunday.
   The actress wore the Christian Dior creation in the box office
blockbuster and for publicity stills with co-star Clark Gable, who
played Rhett Butler.
   When filming finished, Miss Leigh gave the hat to London theater
critic Alan Dent, her close friend and biographer, a spokesman for
Phillips auctioneers said.
   When Dent died in 1978, Scarlett's bonnet passed to an elderly
couple in Cumbria county, northern England, who had given Dent a
home after he retired.
   Phillips will auction it on Friday in Chester, 180 miles
northwest of London, with some of Dent's letters and theater
memorabilia, said the spokesman.
   John Hayes, a friend of the owners, said they wanted the hat
``to go to someone who will appreciate it.''
   ``It is a unique piece of cinema history and I suppose it would
be a good idea if it ended up in a museum devoted to the art.''
   Phillips' specialists are reluctant to specify the value of the
hat. ``Who knows what its value may be to a collector or museum,''
said Jeremy Lamond, of the collectors' department.
