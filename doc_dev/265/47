   Why stop with jolly? At a farm near
Barclay, ``'Tis the season to go hog wild.''
   That's what's written across a wreath on the farm of Jack and
Helen Miller, southwest of Osage City in eastern Kansas. They've
fixed up the quarters of their three sows and 34 piglets, who live
in what was once the old Barclay school building, with appropriate
holiday trappings.
   The old pig house has been decorated for three years now with
red-colored garlands and cardboard Christmas decorations. The pigs'
own miniature Christmas tree, decorated with tinsel and ornaments,
sits in the corridor as a radio plays Christmas music.
   Next year, Mrs. Miller plans to hang a decoration outside _ a
lighted sleigh pulled by eight tiny pigs.
   She got the idea of decorating the pig parlor four years ago
when a litter of pigs was born on Christmas Eve.
   ``It is a happy time of year,'' she said. ``Everybody ought to
enjoy it.''
   Mrs. Miller said she thought it was appropriate to decorate the
parlor because other barnyard animals were in the manger when
Christ was born.
   ``I`ve always thought there were pigs in the manger scene,'' she
said. ``I bet they were there. We just didn`t see them.''

   Five pairs of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara
look-alikes competed in a ``Gone With the Wind'' 50th anniversary
contest, and the winner was _ lawsy me! _ a Yankee.
   Robert Noll of Hudson, Ohio, was picked by a panel of judges
Tuesday night as the most convincing double of Butler, as played by
Clark Gable in the 1939 movie.
   The winning Scarlett was, appropriately, a Southern belle, Emily
Schapmann of Birmingham, Ala.
   They will host an antebellum anniversary ball Thursday night and
appear Friday night at the Fox Theatre during a re-creation of the
movie's Dec. 15, 1939, world premiere.
   Noll rebuffed questions about being a Yankee Rhett Butler.
   ``I'm just glad to be any Rhett Butler,'' he said, noting that
Gable himself was born in Ohio. Butler was from Charleston, S.C.
   And how did Ms. Schapmann feel about winning as Scarlett?
   ``I'll think about that tomorrow,'' she said.
