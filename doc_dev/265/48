<LEADPARA>  JAY LENO hopes the rumors are untrue that David Letterman will leave his
late-late-night NBC show for a late-night slot on ABC where he can provide
competition against "The Tonight Show" when Leno takes it over next year.
"First I hear it's true, then I hear it's not. . . . David and I are friends,
and it would be nice if he stayed at NBC, but if it happens, it happens." If
it happens, Leno would still have the edge. "He'd go on after 'Nightline,' so
I'd still have a half an hour without him," says Leno.;   SPEEDY SEQUEL: "The
Addams Family" stars Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia and Christopher Lloyd have
agreed to team for a sequel to the Paramount picture that opens in some 2,000
theaters on Friday -- if the current film's a hit.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Producer Scott Rudin notes, "The picture was designed with the possibility
of sequels if the original worked. Each of the leads wants to come back if the
others come back. They'd love to do another.";   "The Addams Family" is just
one of several projects Rudin's got perking. Among films in the fire that are
being prepared for '92 production: a big-screen version of the best-selling
book "The Firm" and a Disney film about a talent agent for a 12-year-old
commercials actress. Eddie Murphy was reportedly originally attached to the
latter project. Now Michael J. Fox will most likely star.;   From Liz Smith in
New York;   MORE AIDS SADNESS: In regard to the Jeannie Williams and "A
Current Affair" reports of oil heiress Aileen Getty having AIDS, here is
Elizabeth Taylor's personal response: "She is the mother of my grandchildren,
and she has all my love and support and always will.";   Only people behind
the scenes and close to the star know how much Taylor has agonized over
Getty's illness. The 32-year-old was the first wife of Taylor's second son,
Christopher Wilding. She has been HIV positive for at least six years, and
during all this time Taylor has struggled mightily to help her former
daughter-in-law. Taylor told me several years ago, "Even though she and
Christopher have been divorced for some time, I will always love Aileen as if
she were my very own child." The Taylor grandchildren of that union and their
father have tested negative for the disease.;   Hot on the heels of Magic
Johnson's dramatic headlines came word that the British director Tony
Richardson had died of AIDS complications. He was wed long ago to Vanessa
Redgrave and directed not only the bawdy and brilliant "Tom Jones" but also a
lively remake of "The Charge of the Light Brigade," as well as such classics
as "Look Back in Anger," "A Taste of Honey," "The Entertainer" and that great
cult item, "The Loved One.";   THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT: Whether Alexander might
end up as the King of Yugoslavia or the King of Serbia. (He is already, in
fact, the King of Yugoslavia in exile, but he could take the other title.) I'm
not kidding. There is a powerful group around Margaret Thatcher of Great
Britain wanting very much to see a restoration of this important throne in the
tremulous Balkan area. And Alexander is more than willing.;   ALSO: How Kathie
Lee Gifford has "her two husbands -- the morning one on TV, Regis Philbin; the
real one at night, Frank Gifford." M magazine's Barbara Lippert asks the
question, "Is Kathie Lee the Most Dangerous Woman in America?" (I couldn't
quite figure out why, but you read the piece anyway.);   AND MORE: About the
show you can't get in to see -- "The Rogers &amp; Hart Revue" -- at New York's
Rainbow &amp; Stars, with Elaine Stritch, Margaret Whiting, Judy Kuhn and Jason
Graae. Producers Greg Dawson and Steve Paul have to close this on Nov. 23, and
even celebrities can't get seats. So watch for a move to Broadway.;  
FURTHERMORE: About how fast Sally Field and her Fogwood Productions snapped up
rights, with 20th Century Fox, to the new novel "Jewel," coming from Pocket
Books this month. High-concept types place this work somewhere between "Grapes
of Wrath" and "Flowers for Algernon." The story is of a poor Mississippi
mother who makes incredible sacrifices. Heartbreaking fun for recession-era
readers and moviegoers.;   AND THEN: Jenny Conant's article on the great
success of tzonga-busting Lili Zanuck as Hollywood's sizzling new director of
the coming "Rush." It's in the current issue of Lear's. Lili does it her way!
(And you know what "tzongas" are!) . . . Bette Midler on the cover of Vanity
Fair (and inside) as well as six other major magazine profiles as a result of
the word-of-mouth smash "For the Boys.";   SCARLETT FERVOR: Henry
Beard-Christopher Cerf's "Scarlett Fever" takeoff in The Nation is also
creating talk. They speak of Alexandra Ripley's "Gone With the Wind" sequel
"Scarlett," which opens avenues for similar works.;   "For Whom the Belle
Toils" -- Scarlett's plucky granddaughter as a nurse during the Spanish Civil
War. "Tara! Tara! Tara!" -- Scarlett's plucky great granddaughter manages a
Hawaiian pineapple plantation on the eve of World War II, a sequel to World
War I. "Bonfire of the Mammies" -- Scarlett's plucky
great-great-granddaughter, who made a fortune in Atlanta's go-go real estate
boom, finds her upscale life shattered when she runs over Mammy's
great-great-granddaughter, as a CIA agent.;   As Scarlett III says in "Belle"
-- "After all, the day after tomorrow is another day, too."  </TEXT>
