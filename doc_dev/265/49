   A bank will issue a series of designer
MasterCards to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ``Gone With the
Wind,'' and cable TV mogul Ted Turner will get the first one.
   Citizens and Southern National Bank in Atlanta will issue the
first of the cards this month to coincide with the 50th anniversary
of the film's premiere, which was held Dec. 15, 1939. Every two
years, cardholders will be issued new cards with a different scene
from the movie, bank officials said.
   The first design includes the ``Gone With the Wind'' 50th
anniversary symbol. Future designs will include Rhett Butler,
Scarlett O'Hara and a Rhett and Scarlett profile.
   O.T. Moody, C&amp;S vice president for bank cards, said the first
commemorative card will be issued to Turner, chairman of Turner
Broadcasting Systems. Turner owns the rights to the film.
