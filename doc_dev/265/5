   Rhett Butler is gone and Tara's a mess, but
Scarlett O'Hara still knows one thing: ``Tomorrow is another day.''
   ``Gone With the Wind'' was a mess, too, but David O. Selznick's
blockbuster _ the world's most popular film _ has been restored and
will rise yet again this month for a 50th anniversary tour that's
already selling out theaters.
   Since its Dec. 15, 1939, premiere, the popularity of the movie
based on Margaret Mitchell's novel about the Civil War and
Reconstruction has never faltered.
   It broke box-office records by grossing $14 million its first
year, and new generations flocked to carefully spaced reissues in
1947, 1954, 1961 and 1967. The 1976 television debut was the largest
audience ever to tune in for a theatrical feature, with 33.9 million
homes watching. The film has so far grossed $76.7 million at the box
office, and had been the No. 1 top-grossing movie until ``The Sound
of Music'' edged ahead in 1965.
   A widescreen version made in the 1960s turned ``Gone With the
Wind'' into a celluloid mess. The conversion ruined the color and
composition of the movie, which had been made in Technicolor.
Promoters say the newly restored version brings back the color and
majesty of the original.
   Television entrepreneur Ted Turner, who owns the film, is
planning a 42-city tour in American movie houses for the restored
print. The 3{-hour film, which won eight Academy Awards including
best picture, is already sold out, with tickets at $10 and $12.50
for the first showing Jan. 30-31 in New York City.
   The day of its premiere in 1939, the governor declared a holiday
and more than a million people crowded into downtown Atlanta as
Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh led a parade of stars down Peachtree
Street to Loew's Grand Theater, which was decked out with a white
marble facade reminiscent of Tara, Scarlett's plantation. They were
celebrating the film version of a hometown writer's Pulitzer
Prize-winning epic.
   Turner acquired the rights to the movie in 1985 when he bought
MGM-UA Entertainment Corp. with its massive film library for $1.5
billion. He daily began showing the David O. Selznick blockbuster in
1987 at one of the six theaters at CNN Center, the headquarters of
his cable-TV empire; a shop in the atrium offers ``GWTW''
memorabilia. He also launched his 24-hour TV channel, Turner Network
Television, with _ you guessed it _ ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``It's his favorite movie,'' said Turner Broadcasting System
spokesman Frank Miller, so Turner was ``only too happy'' to foot the
$250,000 bill for the complex restoration process using the original
negatives.
   ``The situation before was that they were making prints from
masters that were several stages removed from the original
negatives,'' Miller said. ``There were prints floating around that
were four or five generations removed.''
   For the restored version, Turner obtained every bit of negative
he could in the best possible condition from Eastman House in
Rochester, N.Y., and then printed ``under optimal conditions,'' he
said.
   ``What really comes out is a better print than has ever been seen
before, even since '39. They (Selznick's crew) had wonderful
equipment for recording and sound, but not as good equipment for
printing it.''
   Also restored is the original ``sweep'' title, which moved across
the screen from right to left in the 1939 version. It had been
replaced by a block title, showing all four words at once, in
remakes during the 1960s.
   The anniversary celebration comes just one year before the
anticipated publication of the long-awaited sequel to Mitchell's
novel. After fighting for decades to keep others from continuing the
story of Scarlett and Rhett, the Mitchell estate authorized a sequel
in 1987 and last year chose Alexandra Ripley, a Virginia author, to
write it.
   Warner Books paid $4.94 million for the rights to publish the
sequel.
   Turner's staff is putting together events to celebrate the film's
50th anniversary in December.
   ``There will be a ball of some kind'' in Atlanta, Miller said,
``but it's not for sure right now what exactly is going to be done.''
   Until Turner bought the rights, Atlanta had few permanent
reminders that it was the home of Mitchell, who won a Pulitzer Prize
for the 1936 novel that has sold 25 million copies. Efforts to save
the apartment where she wrote much of the book are tied up in court.
The Loew's, which opened as an opera house in 1892, was gutted by
fire in 1978.
   The restored version of ``GWTW'' will be available on
videocassette for home use, as will a TBS documentary, ``The Making
of a Legend: Gone With the Wind,'' which was produced by Selznick's
sons, L. Jeffrey and Daniel Selznick.
   The original was released on videocassette in 1985, and has sold
more than 500,000 copies at $89.95 each in the United States with
similar sales overseas. Initially, 29,000 copies had to be destroyed
because they opened with 45 seconds of the wrong music _ a strident
marching song. The videos were later re-released with the correct
tune, ``Dixie.''
