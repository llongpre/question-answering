   Jean Moss, a housewife in Jeffersonville, Ind., has read "Gone With the Wind" a half-dozen times, and she stopped counting how many times she had seen the movie when it hit 30. 
So will she buy the "Gone With the Wind" sequel, due to be published in 1990? 

   Absolutely. 
"There are certain things you have a weakness for," she says, "and it doesn't matter how much it costs or what it takes, you just have to have them." 

   The question facing Warner Books, which earlier this week agreed to pay $5 million for the North American rights to the sequel, is whether there are enough people like Jean Moss. 
Just to break even on its investment, Warner will have to sell some 250,000 hardcover copies. 
While that figure pales compared to Margaret Mitchell's original, which has sold more than 25 million copies world-wide in hardcover and paperback since being published in 1936, it would have placed the book among last year's 15 best sellers. 

   As James Clavell's "Whirlwind" showed, big advances and high expectations don't guarantee a blockbuster. 
But officials at Warner and some other houses believe that a "Gone With the Wind" sequel is as sure a thing as there can be in such a fickle business. 
Others, however, say the project is risky. 
Although the book probably will have an early surge of popularity because of all the publicity surrounding it, if it's bad, no amount of media attention can keep it alive. 

   Laurence Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books, a unit of Warner Communications Inc., says the book has an "enormous marketing leg up before we even start." 
But he concedes that it probably isn't going to get much help from critics. 
"They're going to review it for the amount of money that's been received, and they'll have a glorified notion of how wonderful the original book was," Mr. Kirshbaum says. 
Although he says critics are important to any book's success, he believes Warner can "overcome any skepticism because of the power of our promotion, advertising and word of mouth." 

   But others in the industry say marketing and promotion can only carry a book partway to success. 
"No matter how good or bad this book is, it's going to sell some copies by aggressive marketing," says one publishing-company chief who read the first 39 pages of the sequel but declined to bid on it. 
"But there's clearly a lot of sentiment out there that this book shouldn't be done. 
So if the book isn't good, there could be trouble down the road." 

   Al Silverman, chairman of the Book-of-the-Month Club, says, "For the money involved, it's a bit of a risk." 
The situation reminds Mr. Silverman of celebrities who write an enormously successful memoir and then try writing a second book, which never quite measures up to the first one. 
Even so, Mr. Silverman says his book club will "be dying" for a look at the book as soon as possible. 
"We absolutely would want it," he says. 
"Everyone's going to want to know how it all ends up." 

   Some retail booksellers join the skeptics, wondering how the publisher can promise good sales when the quality of the book, of which only two chapters have been written, is unknown. 
"You can't just manufacture a good book," says Lawrence Abramoff, owner of Tatnuck Bookseller &amp; Sons in Worcester, Mass. 
"And if it's not good, it won't sell." 

   Now it's up to the author, Alexandra Ripley, to write the book that has caused this debate. 
And Mr. Kirshbaum realizes that everyone is going to want to know one thing: How it ends. 
"We're going to hire the security guards from Fort Knox to watch over the ending," he says. 

   But that won't necessarily be the end of the saga. 
"It's possible" that there will be a sequel after this one, says Thomas Hal Clarke, one of the Atlanta lawyers assigned to protect Scarlett and Rhett's honor. 
"It would depend how the first sequel comes out."
