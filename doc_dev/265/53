<LEADPARA>  Novels by all the big guns of American pop fiction -- Stephen King, Tom Clancy
and Danielle Steel -- were vying for attention Saturday at the opening of the
American Booksellers Association convention in New York. But that didn't stop
one lesser-known from grabbing the spotlight: Alexandra Ripley, whose 850-page
"Scarlett: The Sequel" to Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind" will be
released in 40 countries Sept. 25.;    Ripley, who had her tresses dyed deep
red for the occasion, won't reveal her plot, but she says she took five years
to write her book (the first year handwriting the original to "get into
Margaret Mitchell's mind") and that every major character is accounted for.
Plans for a movie are under way.  </LEADPARA>
