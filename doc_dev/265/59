   Jimmy Stewart says he's ready for another movie,
if the right script comes along.
   ``Can't play cowboys anymore,'' he adds, however.
   Stewart, 81, who hasn't acted in about five years, was
interviewed for the June issue of Vogue.
   The star, who once ran the movie projector in his hometown of
Indiana, Pa., acquired a degree in architecture from Princeton.
That profession was of little use at the height of the Depression,
so he opted for acting.
   Acting troupes led to Broadway walk-on roles, and after a few
years, New York led to Hollywood. Within four years, he'd made 25
movies.
   At 32, with credits that included ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington'' and ``The Philadelphia Story,'' Stewart entered the
Army in 1941, becoming one of the few movie stars to serve in World
War II.
   He returned to Hollywood fearful of his future, with his
contract expired and wondering if the public would still remember
him.
   ``That's why I thank (director) Frank Capra in prayers every
day,'' he said. ``'Cause he just, out of the blue, called me up and
said, `I got an idea for a story, and why don't you come down to
the house?'''
   The result was ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' which was not
successful when it became out but has since become a much-loved
Christmastime perennial.
   ``Looking back over it, I can just see that the picture meant
more to me than any other,'' said Stewart.

   Is-she or isn't-she speculation is
cropping up again from so-called family sources who Monday denied
earlier reports that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is
expecting a second child.
   It also was family sources who confirmed Pakistani newspaper
reports in March that Ms. Bhutto, who became the head of government
after general elections in November 1988, was expecting a baby this
October.
   One source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the rumor
apparently started when Ms. Bhutto gained weight earlier this year.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, was wed to Karachi businessman Asif Ali Zardari
in a traditional Moslem arranged marriage in December 1987. She
gave birth to a son, Bilawal, on Sept. 21, 1988.
   Family sources also gave conflicting information during that
pregnancy. Some told reporters the baby was due as late as December.
   Ms. Bhutto is scheduled to deliver the commencement address at
Harvard University, her alma mater, on June 8.

   Singer Celia Cruz, the first lady of
salsa music, was awarded an honorary doctor of music degree Monday
from Yale University during the school's 288th commencement
exercises.
   ``Your unique style has forged in this, your adopted country, a
new form of Caribbean music and made salsa an international rhythm
in which you have once again proclaimed an unbowed affirmation of
life,'' said a citation read by Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr.
   Cruz, now a resident of New York, began singing on radio in her
native Cuba in the late 1940s. She went into voluntary exile in
1960, after the Communist takeover, eventually settling in the
United States.
   Her popularity spread to audiences in the United States during
the 1970s when a version of the traditional bolero, mamba and
guaracha music known as salsa became popular on the East Coast. She
has made more than 50 albums.
   Cruz, who does not disclose her age, is believed to be in her
early 60s.

   When he's at work, Nana Opoku Asamoah tends to
his real estate and coin-operated laundry interests, negotiating in
impeccable English.
   But when the 41-year-old native of Ghana assumes his role as
king of 20,000 Ashanti, he speaks only in his native Twi and avoids
direct conversation with outsiders.
   Nana Asamoah was crowned Saturday as surrogate king of the
10,000 Ashanti in the United States. In the large ballroom of the
Roosevelt Hotel, the king accepted gifts and greetings from chiefs
and royalty from the Ashanti and other Ghanaian tribe, the Ewe and
Akwapim.
   Nana Asamoah, who was born into a family of prosperous cocoa
farmers, became king in January by election of the Asanteman
Association, not by birthright like the long line of Ashanti kings
in Ghana.
   Speaking in Twi through his translators, Nana Asamoah said his
greatest challenge is ``seeing that our children not lose sight of
their culture in the melting pot of New York.''

   Black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela will be
honored in mid-June with a prize named after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan news agency JANA said Monday.
   JANA, in a dispatch from Tripoli which was monitored in Rome,
did not say if the prize consisted of money or who exactly was
sponsoring it. The Observer newspaper reported Sunday in London
that the award is worth $250,000 and that Libya is establishing a
$10 million foundation in Geneva for future awards.
   Mandela, 70, has been serving a life sentence in South Africa
since 1962 for planning an African National Congress campaign to
undermine white minority rule.

   Alexandra Ripley, who's writing a sequel
to ``Gone With the Wind,'' confided to graduates of her high school
alma mater that failing is OK and that lots of writers can be
pretty dumb.
   ``I urge you, with all of my strength, to go out there and fail.
... If you're not afraid to fail, possibilities are everywhere,''
she said Sunday in a commencement speech at Ashley Hall, a private
girls' school in Charleston.
   Ms. Ripley said when she graduated in 1951, she didn't dare to
dream she could be a writer because, ``Writers, real writers, I
thought, were people who were a million times smarter than I'd ever
be.'' But after meeting a few, she concluded that ``Surprise,
surprise. They weren't all that smart. Several of them, in fact,
were spectacularly dumb.''
   The author of several successful novels based in the South
signed a lucrative agreement with Margaret Mitchell's estate to
write a sequel to the author's classic Civil War novel. It's due
out in September 1990.
   She told the graduates she couldn't disclose whether Scarlett
O'Hara and Rhett Butler reunite in the sequel for two reasons:
``the publisher would chop me to little pieces if I did'' and ``I
haven't finished the book and I haven't even decided.''
