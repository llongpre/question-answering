EXCERPT DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The excerpt reveals that Rhett Butler and the tempestuous Scarlett O'Hara
reunite briefly in Charleston, S.C., where Rhett offers her half a million in
gold if she'll go away for good.;    Before you can say fiddle-dee-dee, Rhett
divorces Scarlett and marries Anne Hampton, a new character. Scarlett --
pregnant via a brief encounter with Rhett -- learns the news while visiting
Ireland to lick her wounds in the birthplace of the O'Haras.;    Ripley,
handpicked by the estate of Margaret Mitchell to write the sequel, spent
months researching the period. She hand-copied Mitchell's words to develop a
sense of her style.;    You be the judge.;    When Scarlett begs Rhett to take
her back, he laughs and says:;    "I'll give you half a million dollars in
gold if you will go away. Your greedy little heart can't possibly prefer a
futile attempt to save our marriage to a fortune bigger than you ever hoped
for. As a bonus, I'll resume payments for that monstrosity on Peachtree Street
in Atlanta.";    Scarlett makes a counteroffer:;    "So I've got a deal to
offer you. Stop acting so hateful to me. Act nice and help me have a good
time. We go through the season like a devoted, happy husband and wife. Then,
come spring, I'll go home and start over.";    Will the two ever get back
together permanently? Readers will have to wait until next month to find out.;
   The nine-page excerpt from "Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's
Gone With the Wind," will be on newsstands Monday in Life's September issue.; 
  The 768-page book will be published simultaneously in 40 countries. The
first printing of 500,000 copies will be published in the United States on
Sept. 25.;    Warner Books paid $4.5 million at a Mitchell estate auction in
1988 for the rights to publish the sequel, but the estate got to choose the
author.;    Ripley has written several historical books, including "New
Orleans Legacy" and "Charleston."  </TEXT>
