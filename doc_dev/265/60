   The ``Rat Pack'' tour has become ``The
Ultimate Event,'' as Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. joined
forces with Liza Minnelli for an 18-concert, 12-city U.S. tour.
   Sinatra and Davis had begun a recent singing tour with rat-pack
buddy Dean Martin, but Martin had to drop out after six concerts
when an old kidney problem flared up.
   ``We miss Dean and we love him _ he's like a brother to me and
Sam,'' Sinatra said Thursday. ``Liza is the greatest female
performer of our time. She is a great lady and it is always a
privilege to share a stage with her.''
   The tour, dubbed ``The Ultimate Event,'' will debut at Houston's
Summit Arena on Sept. 17 and end at the Chicago Theater on Oct. 16,
said Susan Reynolds, vice president of entertainment, marketing and
publicity for Burson-Marsteller.
   ``Liza has been a good friend for many years and my admiration
for her is limitless,'' Davis said. ``Let me tell you, this will be
a fall to remember.''

   Being a princess is not all it's
cracked up to be, says Princess Diana, who added that she enjoys an
occasional shopping trip to a supermarket, local workers reported.
   Diana, the wife of Prince Charles, the heir to the British
throne, was in this city 19 miles outside London to open a big new
shopping mall Thursday and told workers she enjoys buying tea-time
treats for her young sons, Harry and William.
   ``We spoke to her about it not being an easy life. She said it
was not all that it's made out to be,'' said pet shop manager Judy
Straton. But, ``She said she'd rather not say anything about that.''
   The royal family is the constant object of attention of
England's racy tabloids. Earlier this year, rumors abounded that
Charles' and Diana's marriage was troubled.

   Former Texas Gov. John B. Connally, who
filed for personal bankruptcy earlier this year, has been hired to
help a designer of all-plastic weapons try to sell sell its
technology to the U.S. military.
   Redeye Arms Inc. has developed a process that could be used for
weapons ranging from hand guns to howitzers, the company's chief
operating officer, John Floren, said Thursday.
   ``Based upon my understanding of this technology, it represents
an opportunity to revolutionize conventional armaments and defense
systems,'' said Connally, a former Navy Secretary, during a meeting
in Houston with company officials. The terms of the contract were
not disclosed.
   Plastic weapons have been criticized as a boon to terrorists but
Floren said the new weapons will be detectable to airport security
systems, and that the main use for the technology was in larger
weapons.
   Connally, a victim of Texas' oil and real estate slump, had his
personal property auctioned off in January after filing for
bankruptcy.

   Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder, fired as a
CBS sports commentator earlier this year, says he's been ``hiding''
in a posh hotel since then. To add to his troubles, he's back in
the hospital for chest pains.
   The 70-year-old oddsmaker was in good condition and undergoing
tests and observation, Miami Heart Institute spokeswoman Esther
Saporito said Thursday.
   Snyder, dismissed from ``NFL Today'' in January because of his
controversial remarks about black athletes, said he woke up in his
hotel room here Wednesday with chest pains.
   ``I don't take any chances, the sooner they can do something for
you the better,'' he said from his hospital bed. ``They (doctors)
are just looking to see what they find.''
   Snyder was hospitalized last July at Duke Medical Center in
Durham, N.C., where examinations disclosed that an artery to his
heart was blocked, and again shortly after his firing. Afterward,
Snyder took up residence alone at the posh, oceanfront Alexander
Hotel on Miami Beach.
   ``I've been hiding there for 2{ months and then this had to
happen,'' said Snyder, adding that he didn't feel ``too good right
now.''

   Morton Downey Jr., the ultra-conservative
talk-show host known for his confrontational style with guests, has
been cleared of charges that he assaulted a gay rights activist
during a program.
   Judge Emil DelBaglivo found Downey innocent of assaulting Andrew
Humm, a 34-year-old spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay
Rights.
   DelBaglivo watched a videotape of the show and listened to
testimony during a 4{-hour trial Wednesday before issuing his
decision.
   The tape shows Humm raising his right arm during an angry
exchange between the two. Downey abruptly struck Humm's arm away,
and in doing so, grazed Humm's face.
   The 55-year-old Downey flashed his familiar toothy grin to the
crowd after the verdict and said, ``I am very pleased.''

   Alexandra Ripley, a writer of historical novels,
has been selected to write the long-awaited sequel to ``Gone With
the Wind,'' according to Life magazine.
   The magazine's May issue reports that Ripley, 54, was selected
from a dozen finalists two years ago by the William Morris Agency,
which is handling the project for the family of GWTW author
Margaret Mitchell.
   Ripley, the author of ``Charleston,'' ``New Orleans Legacy'' and
two other historical novels, has written an outline and two
chapters of the sequel, which will be shown to publishers on Monday.
   The auction for hardcover rights could fetch as much as $6
million, with most of the profits going to Mitchell's two nephews,
the magazine said.
   Mitchell, who was killed in 1949 by a drunken driver, refused to
write a sequel to her 1936 novel, saying the story of Rhett Butler,
Scarlett O'Hara and the Civil War reached its ``natural and proper
ending.''
