<LEADPARA>  WHOOPI Goldberg's favorite book is Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird." Cher
was chilled by Anne Rice's "Interview With a Vampire." And James Stewart
praised James Michener's island epic, "Hawaii.";    Goldberg, Cher and Stewart
are just a few of the scores of celebrities on Glenna Nowell's growing list of
who reads what. And just who is Glenna Nowell? She's an enterprising librarian
in this little Maine city who just released her fourth annual list. She came
up with the idea of writing to celebrities in 1988.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Some celebrities send Nowell cordial notes, listing several favorites.
Others, such as Queen Elizabeth II, coolly turn her down.;    "I was looking
for a hook that would get people to read a book," Nowell says, adding she also
wanted to steer readers toward books other than best sellers.;    After
looking at news and fashion magazines and listening to suggestions from
readers, Nowell formulated her first list of VIPs to be contacted. She dug
their addresses from the celebrity references at the Gardiner Public Library.;
   The first list included several Maine political figures, and such
entertainers as Doris Day, whose favorite is "Kinship With All Life"; Lana
Turner, who liked "Anatomy of an Illness"; and Oprah Winfrey, who listed "The
Color Purple" among her favorites. And then there was Alan Alda, whose
response Nowell still considers her favorite.;    Among the actor's best-liked
volumes is "The Congressional Record," which he remembers poring over as a
child. "I had never read anything so funny," Alda wrote. "From then on, I knew
I wanted to do comedy.";    Lucy's favorites;  Lucille Ball, writing back for
the 1989 list, recalled being "enchanted" as a child by "Black Beauty," as
well as "Life of Samuel Johnson.";    "But, I think the important thing is to
read and read and read," the late comedian said, before her sweeping signature
that simply said "Lucy.";    First Lady Barbara Bush picked "The Autobiography
of Frederick Douglass," and Jimmy Carter chose James Agee's "Let Us Now Praise
Famous Men." Maureen Stapleton's top book was "The Brothers Karamazov," and
Steven Spielberg chose "The Leatherstocking Saga" and "Treasure Island.";   
Ann Landers' favorite book is "The Scarlet Letter." Rev. Desmond M. Tutu
recommends "God's Fool" and "The Journey and the Dream.";    Connie Chung's
favorites are the classic "Little Women," along with "All the King's Men" and
"All the President's Men." Stephen King likes "Fifth Business" and "Lord of
the Flies.";    Carol Burnett told Nowell "no book will ever have the impact
of 'The Yearling' read for the first time.";    Arsenio Hall chose "Little
Girl Lost," while Bob Hope listed the Mark Twain classics "Tom Sawyer" and
"Huckleberry Finn." The latter also was Diane Sawyer's top pick.;    Garrison
Keillor picked "Wartime," and communications mogul Ted Turner hailed
"Commodore Hornblower" and "Mutiny on the Bounty.";    Nowell's latest list
includes a rare reply from a sports figure -- Jack Nicklaus -- who said he's
found time to read all of Wilbur Smith's books in his sparse spare time.
Nicklaus, who confessed he didn't care much for reading as a child, said his
current favorite is "A Time to Die.";    Cybill Shepherd listed "Women, Sex
and Addiction," Angela Lansbury tabbed "The Shell Seekers" and Vincent Price
likes "Nothing If Not Critical.";    Marilyn Quayle recommends "The Icon and
the Axe," Jeff Bridges picks "Iron John," Geraldo Rivera recommends "One
Hundred Years of Solitude" and Loretta Lynn said her best-loved book is the
Bible.;    Humanizing question;  Of the 145 letters Nowell sent out for this
year's list, only 22 wrote back with the name of their favorite book. Others
replied, but declined to say what they like to read.;    "That makes them
human, to see what they are reading," says Nowell, who has noticed some
non-celebrities even "get antsy" when she examines the titles on their
living-room bookshelves.;    A lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II answered
Nowell's letter stiffly, "I am commanded by The Queen to write and thank you
for your letter, but because of Her Majesty's rules in these matters, I regret
it is not possible for her to do as you ask.";    Politicians have been
generally eager to write back. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, is the only one invited twice to respond, since "he was promoted" to
majority leader in 1988. Mitchell's latest favorite: "The Great Triumvirate.";
   Nowell is already collecting names for her next list, with designs on such
hot celebrities as Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and Saddam Hussein -- "if he's
still living."  </TEXT>
