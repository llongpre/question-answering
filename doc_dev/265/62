<LEADPARA>  Happy that she'll soon be chucking the weary publicity load she's been toting,
author Alexandra Ripley is looking forward to slipping into blue jeans and
munching pizza at home in Charleston, S.C. Says the woman who penned the
infamous sequel to "Gone With the Wind": "I'm going to go home and scrape all
the paint off my face, take off my gaudy clothes, put on blue jeans and
scratch the head of my cat and see if she remembers me, get reacquainted with
my husband and then probably do something exotic like have a pizza. Double
anchovies." Despite brutal reviews, more than half a million copies have been
sold of "Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind."
Ripley's tour for the book ends Thursday.  </LEADPARA>
