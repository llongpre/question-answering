   Cammie King Conlon, who played Bonnie Blue in
the movie ``Gone With the Wind,'' says if it didn't take so long to
begin shooting the film classic, she would have never landed the
part.
   ``I got the role by default,'' Conlon said of the decision to
have her play Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler's child. ``My older
sister was cast for the part, but by the time the shooting began,
she was too old to play Bonnie Blue.''
   Conlon and two other actors said the process of filling
supporting roles was very casual. The performers helped mark the
50th anniversary of the Academy Award-winning production at the
annual Clark Gable celebration Saturday in the actor's birthplace.
   Gable played Butler, the film's central male character.
   Also on hand at the celebration was Daniel Mayer Selznick, the
son of the late GWTW producer David O. Selznick. Daniel Selznick
recently completed a documentary on the making of ``Gone With the
Wind.''
