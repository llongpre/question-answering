Up here in Scotland, Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair (1932-34)
is something of a classic. The novels - Sunset Song, Cloud Howe and Grey
Granite - take Chris Guthrie from childhood in a Scottish croft before the
First World War, and marriage to a local farmer, through to her second
marriage and socialist fervour in the deprived urban conditions of the
1920s, and so to standing apart from her son Ewan as he grows up and becomes
a Communist in the 1930s. Two years ago, TAG Theatre Company staged a
sell-out version of Sunset Song, and now it is staging all three.
Grassic Gibbon's depiction of the bygone life of the crofts is curiously
akin to Margaret Mitchell's evocation of the vanished South in Gone with the
Wind (and, like Scarlett O'Hara, Chris Guthrie marries three times).
I say 'curiously', since Mitchell's account is rightwing and perilously
close to pulp romance; yet Scarlett is altogether less passive than the
lyrical and reflective leftwing Chris. Grassic Gibbon's vision was the most
loveable kind of Marxism. He set each character against the toughness of
their social conditions; and to anyone who struggled to determine the course
of his or her own destiny he accorded a kind of heroic dignity.
The TAG production goes straight for the lyricism of Chris's, and Grassic
Gibbon's, vision. Chris sings some of her soliloquies, in affecting folk
style (composed by Dougie MacLean); and the folk around her sing the various
songs of their time and place. They also dance; and choreographer Andrew
Howitt has economically caught the contrasting poetries of farmwork and
steel-foundry work, of social life and private life.
After Saturday's performance of the complete trilogy on Saturday, large
parts of the audience rose to their feet to hail and cheer the TAG
achievement - and, of course, Grassic Gibbon's achievement too. I applauded
too, but I found the plays too loaded with charm to be able to cheer. The
adaptation from page to stage, which has been done by Alastair Cording, is
paced with variety, but - a big but - all too often boils down important
scenes into telegrammatic precis that miss the truth of serious human
feeling.
The adaptation also exposes and highlights a sentimentality at Grassic
Gibbon's heart. Chris's father was a bully who drove his wife to suicide and
who attempted incestuous rape on his daughter; but at his funeral Chris
forgives him, because of his social conditions. Chris's first husband turns
into a drunk who abuses her; but after his death at the front we discover
that army life had wrecked him and that he had always really loved her. Her
second husband turns into an unfeeling religious bigot; but, when dying, he
rediscovers his love for her and his socialist convictions. How many of
these in-the-hour-of-death soft-centered forgivenesses can you take?
TAG presents the whole saga with just a dozen performers. Most of them have
marvellous faces, modernist faces that seem sculpted, faces that move with
maximum simplicity. As Chris, Pauline Knowles has exemplary stillness,
directness and tenderness. (Her only faults are an occasional tendency to
chant her spoken monologues and to let us know that she has found the next
Mr Right by gazing spellbound right at him.) As her son and her first
husband, Stuart Bowman is even finer; it is hard, at the third play's close,
to believe just how different he was in the first. Anne Kidd delivers a
whole range of contrasting character roles with beautiful vigour. (Only
Nicola Burnett Smith lets the side down with over-busy 'surface' acting.)
Every year you know that the Edinburgh Festival will include a few chunks of
Scottish art - a token few bits of national art amid a generally
international festival.
A Scots Quair is virtually guaranteed to charm those who want to be charmed
by Scotland. The diction alone is adorable: 'You canna manage the whole
hoose on your ain,' 'God pity the puir bairn the faither it had,' 'Dinna
fash me - mebbe he'll no' want tae,' 'My hairt is beatin' fair tae burst
frae my breast,' etc.
Even the toughnesses that A Scots Quair depicts, and its subversiveness, are
part of a Scotland many people are only too happy to believe in.
Until September 4 at the Assembly Hall.
