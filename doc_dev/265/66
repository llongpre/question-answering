<TEXT>  Dutton, 339 pp., $19.95;  IN HER earlier memoir, "Scarlett O'Hara's Younger
Sister," published in 1977, Evelyn Keyes led us on a merry, sexy dance through
her marriages and other romantic entanglements in Hollywood. It was all the
merrier because the writing was so manifestly her own. No ghostly hand could
have achieved such a perky, personal, uninhibited voice, recalling an
uninhibited and unembarrassed life.;    Having been under personal contract to
Cecil B. De Mille ("The Buccaneer" and "Union Pacific"), she did indeed play
Suellen, Scarlett's kid sister, in "Gone With the Wind," and was memorable in
"Here Comes Mr. Jordan," "The Jolson Story" and "Mrs. Mike," among dozens of
other less memorable films. She did a cameo in "Around the World in 80 Days"
for Mike Todd, with whom she spent three years.;    Now, 14 years after the
first reminiscences and at the age of 71, Keyes has evoked "GWTW" again for
the title of another memoir, "I'll Think About That Tomorrow," Scarlett's
defiant shucking off of all that is worrisome.;    The Keyes voice remains
unchanged: perky, candid, funny, self-chiding, alive with spontaneity and joie
de vivre. But there is a central difference. Beneath the amusing tone, her
book is a thoughtful portrait of an actress who is no longer an ingenue,
coming to terms with her seniority.;    She insists that someone really did
ask, "Didn't you used to be. . . ." And there was the child in London whose
mother reminded him that they had watched one of Keyes' films on the telly
only the night before. "You look older now," said the honest child. The mother
was horrified, but Keyes says she praised the boy for his candor and his
accuracy.;    The memoir begins as she and then-husband Artie Shaw sell the
house they had so carefully built atop a sea cliff in Spain, to resettle in a
25-room mansion in Connecticut. The portrait of Shaw -- demanding, irascible,
an obsessive enthusiast about what grabs him at a given moment -- is
affectionate, but it does suggest that one of Keyes' gifts is infinite
patience.;    There is a sad, affectionate account as well of her later,
post-marriage meetings with John Huston, whose wasting battles with emphysema
convinced her to give up cigarettes cold turkey. Huston, always gallant, was
disappointingly noncommittal about the writing in which she had begun to take
such pride. What emerges from the book is the observation that Keyes always
has been drawn to men with notably strong egos. It makes her own declaration
of independence, which the book represents, the more impressive.;    For in
the end, "I'll Think About That Tomorrow" is not so much an anecdotal look
back as it is a story of learning to cope with solitariness. What gives her
book a relevance beyond the star-memoir genre is that the fears and
difficulties of adjusting to a changed life are universal. Her early dreams --
Hollywood and finding a prince, or several -- had been realized. Now, she
writes, "The only trouble was I hadn't prepared for anything, didn't have a
single dream whatsoever to carry me through my later span." Many a woman could
say that, who hadn't played Scarlett's little sister.  </TEXT>
