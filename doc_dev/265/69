SALEM IS MY DWELLING PLACE: A LIFE OF NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE by Edwin Haviland

University Press Pounds 35, 284 pages
THE SAVAGE vindictiveness of the 17th century Salem witch-hunt, so well
dramatised by Arthur Miller in The Crucible, left its trauma on the
high-minded descendants of its perpetrators. The notion of predetermined
guilt, of an ineradicable stain, is the key to the Romances and many of the
shorter tales of the great New England novelist, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Two
new books show how the guilt that afflicts so many of his characters is
related to historical events.
A scholarly biography of Hawthorne by Edwin Haviland Miller, professor of
English emeritus at New York University, focuses to begin with on two of
Nathaniel's forebears. William Hathorne - as the name was originally spelt -
settled in Salem from England in 1636. William was a soldier and a merciless
judge, who once ordered an offending Quaker woman to be stripped to the
waist, tied to a cart, and then flogged as it moved through the streets. It
was his son John, an army colonel and a magistrate during the trials of the
1690s, who meted out equally cruel punishments to Salem women accused of
witchcraft on the flimsiest, most contrived evidence.
In making fiction out of the excesses of his Puritan ancestors, Hawthorne
anticipated the technique of a modern movie-director. He was a master of
crowd scenes, as in The Scarlet Letter, and of a subtle choice of
camera-angles as in his most enchanting book, The House of the Seven Gables,
where he tracks in and out of the various rooms in the house and highlights
its curious structure containing relics of one prominent New England family
 -his own  - over several generations.
Hawthorne's favourite trick is the dissolve. He uses it incessantly in his
work to show how past impinges on present. In Gables, he transports the
reader from the founding generation to the present villain, Judge Pyncheon,
who reincarnates Hawthorne's ancestor. Pyncheon is shown tyrannising his
feckless cousin Clifford. This gentle aesthete likes to do nothing better
than blow soap-bubbles - an instance of Hawthorne inventing an image of the
kind of old man he felt he might easily become, but in fact did not.
Miller's book is strong on this family context. When he turns to
interpreting the texts, he opts for the straight Freudian explanation of
Hawthorne's sometimes painfully revealing obsessions. Hawthorne's sailor
father died at sea when the novelist was a small child; he became fixated on
a mother, who withdrew into a world of her own. Then, after a long
engagement, Hawthorne married Sophia Peabody, who gave him the abundance of
affection his childhood had lacked. Sophia's older sister, the spinster
Elizabeth Peabody, achieved her immortality when she became Miss Birdseye in
Henry James's The Bostonians.
The Hawthornes lived at different times throughout their happy marriage in
Salem, Concord and Lenox. Sophia produced two daughters and a son, all of
whom whom she adored second only to her husband, whom she thought of either
as the Adam of a new Eden or as a reincarnation of the sun-god Apollo. For a
while he was adored, too, by Melville, who dedicated Moby Dick to Hawthorne
 -a passion not returned. Hawthorne's oedipal subconscious drives were
firmly focused on the female maternal breast so prominent in The Scarlet
Letter, where the heroine's is branded with a capital A.
Charles Swann of the University of Keele, in his critical study Nathaniel
Hawthorne: Tradition and Revolution, thinks the psychiatric couch approach
to Hawthorne has been much over-done. He finds a fascinating wealth of
evidence of Hawthorne's imagination drawing sustenance from the troubled of
past of New England, and he discerns in some of the works a spirit of
inquiry into the nature of fiction. Swann dissects at great length, and with
breath-taking subtlety, The Marble Faun in the light of the Christian notion
of the Fortunate Fall. He also examines it as a classic case of an
unfinished work.
Both writers are in no doubt as to the importance of some of the uncompleted
posthumously published material which has become available in recent years -
The Elixir of Life manuscript, and the less well-known tales, now all
gathered together in the Tales and Sketches volume in the Library of America
series. Each offers an interpretation of that strange tale, 'The Appeal of
Alice Doane' which opens on Gallows Hill, Salem, on a pleasant summer
afternoon in the present. Then, in a typical Hawthorne dissolve, the setting
reverts to being the dreaded site of execution in the 17th century. A
procession of those who have been hanged comes into view, followed by a long
line of their accusers. Isolated in the rear on horseback is Cotton Mather
'. . . proud of his well-won dignity, as the representative of all the
hateful features of his time; the one blood-thirsty man, in whom were
concentrated those vices of sprit and errors of opinion, that sufficed to
madden the whole surrounding multitude'. That was a stunningly brave
denunciation when Hawthorne penned it.
Hawthorne's books sold only moderately well in his lifetime. He was haunted
not merely by the past, but also by his creditors. He had been a class-mate
at Bowdoin College of Franklin Pierce, whose career was in government. That
led to Hawthorne's preferment to lucrative jobs at the Boston and Salem
Customs Houses. It was in the Boston one that he discovered the original
embroidered scarlet letter which set in train his book. Or so he said.
When Pierce stood for President, Hawthorne wrote his campaign biography at
his friend's request, but to the dismay of those who hated the candidate's
anti-abolitionist views. Hawthorne was rewarded by being made American
consul at Liverpool at the age of 49. It was a grimly uncongenial place for
a fastidious New England family searching all the while for Bunyan's
Celestial City: but they survived it. Hawthorne amassed a small fortune in
shipping fees, enabling him to retire to Italy after Pierce failed to be
re-nominated for a second term as President.
It was during their stay in Rome that Hawthorne's older daughter Una
contracted near-fatal malaria, never fully to recover, and the decline in
his fortunes began. Back home in New England he suffered a complete
crack-up. It is a moving story - well told here by Miller on a broad canvas,
with many of the minor characters, like the transcendentalist Margaret
Fuller and the publisher James Field, neatly etched in. In spite of
stylistic archaisms, Hawthorne remains capable of an incomparable richness
of texture which both these books help us to appreciate more fully than
hitherto.
