   For 50 years people have wondered: Did Rhett
Butler and Scarlett O'Hara ever get back together, or was it all
over for the tempestuous lovers of ``Gone With the Wind'' when
Rhett walked out the door.
   Margaret Mitchell never told, and now the answer is up to
Alexandra Ripley, a Virginia author chosen by Miss Mitchell's
estate to write the sequel to the Civil War-era epic.
   Ms. Ripley isn't saying what she'll do, but her novel appears
certain to be a multimillion-dollar production that the
luxury-loving Scarlett would have appreciated.
   Officials of the William Morris Agency in New York, which is
handling the book for the Mitchell estate, said publishers are
reading the first two chapters this week and next and will bid on
the book at an auction in a week to 10 days. It is to be published
in 1990.
   ``I just can't talk price because we just don't know,'' said
Robert Gottlieb of the Morris agency, who represents Ms. Ripley.
But he said the auction price was sure to be ``in a substantial
multiple of millions.'' Life magazine predicted it could hit $6
million.
   Ms. Ripley told Life, which has contracted to run excerpts of
the sequel, that she will take about 18 months to write the
1,000-page, still-untitled book.
   ``This one will never be mine,'' she said. ``It's a foster
mother kind of thing. I am trying to prepare myself for a universal
hatred of what I'm going to do. Yes, Margaret Mitchell writes
better than I do _ but she's dead.''
   Miss Mitchell, who was killed by an Atlanta taxi in 1949,
refused to write a sequel to her 1936 novel, saying the story had
reached its ``natural and proper ending.''
   But her estate announced last year that it had begun work on an
authorized novel continuing the tale of Scarlett and Rhett.
   T. Hal Clarke, an attorney for the estate, said Stephens
Mitchell, the author's brother, reluctantly agreed before his death
in 1983 that the family must proceed with the book to prevent a
flood of unauthorized sequels when the ``Gone With the Wind''
copyright expires in 2011.
   Clarke said Friday that he was pleased with the selection of Ms.
Ripley from a dozen authors.
   ``Of course, we're prejudiced down here in Atlanta about
Margaret Mitchell,'' he said, ``and I think Alexandra herself
realizes she may not measure up _ indeed she said so. But having
said that, in our day and time I think she is an extremely talented
lady and will do the most credible sequel that we could come out
with.''
   Clarke said the family will give Ms. Ripley a free hand,
although the estate set broad guidelines for the book and has a
right to refuse her manuscript if she steps outside those
parameters.
   ``We didn't want any hilariously raw sex,'' he said.
   Ms. Ripley, a Charleston, S.C., native who wants to keep her
current hometown in Virginia a secret, promised there won't be any.
   She told Life she will write more openly about sex than Miss
Mitchell did, but ``I don't do graphic descriptions of what people
do to one another. It makes me snicker.''
   She said she also will not imitate the thick slave dialect of
the original because ``I find it hard to read, and black people
find it demeaning.''
   Although Ms. Ripley is keeping her plot secret, she suggested
Charleston, Rhett's hometown, would figure in the sequel.
   ``Can you imagine Scarlett in old Charleston?'' she asked in an
interview with The (Charleston) News and Courier. ``Can you see her
and Rhett going to the St. Cecilia Ball? Hmmmmmm. `Oh, fiddlededee,
who IS that strange person?' I just don't see how I can resist
having a little touch of Charleston in the book!''
   Ms. Ripley, 54, grew up in Charleston as Alexandra Braid and
attended Vassar College on a scholarship from the United Daughters
of the Confederacy. She has written four historical novels,
``Charleston, ``On Leaving Charleston,'' ``New Orleans Legacy'' and
``The Time Returns.''
