Three performers who appeared in "Gone With the Wind" helped mark the 50th 
anniversary of the Academy Award-winning film at the annual Clark Gable 
celebration over the weekend in Gable's birthplace, Cadiz, Ohio. On hand were 
Cammie King Conlon, who played Scarlett and Rhett's child, Bonnie Blue; Patrick 
Curtis, who was Ashley and Melanie Wilkes' infant son, and Fred Crane (the 
former longtime classical music program host at KFAC in Los Angeles), who had 
the role of Brent Tarleton, one of Scarlett's suitors. The celebration was 
sponsored by the Clark Gable Foundation, which plans to build a theater and 
museum where Gable films would be shown year-round. Gable was born in Cadiz, 
but grew up in nearby Hopedale. ALEENE MacMINN
