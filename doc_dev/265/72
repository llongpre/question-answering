Best known as Scarlett O'Hara's mammy in "Gone With the Wind," Hattie McDaniel 
played in about 300 films. It was not until after she received the Academy 
Award -- the first black person ever to win the honor -- that she was 
automatically given screen credits, although she was at the time no newcomer to 
the screen; her previous appearances had included "The Blonde Venus" and "I'm 
No Angel." "Hattie" draws on the actress' personal papers to tell the story of 
her life and career. A detailed chapter on the filming of "Gone With the Wind" 
gives insight into her professional relationships with fellow cast members 
Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Butterfly McQueen.

McDaniel's portrayal of stereotypical black roles earned her the criticism of 
Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP. A performer from age 15, the 
first black woman to sing on radio and among the first to appear regularly on 
television, McDaniel was proud of the advances she had made in her career, and 
deeply resented White's accusations. A chapter detailing this feud -- "The 
Crusade Against 'Mammyism' " -- gives insight into the inner workings of 
Hollywood negotiations, and airs the contemporary arguments on the role of film 
in promoting or combatting racial stereotypes; it is interesting to see how 
little has changed.
