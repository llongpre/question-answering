   It is no accident that the cover of John
Updike's new novel consists entirely of an oversize scarlet letter.
   ``S.'' (Knopf, $17.95) is a contemporary spin on Nathaniel
Hawthorne's classic tale of adultery. It is also a lighthearted
send-up of the New Age fascination with Eastern religions and a
poignant study of the dynamics of marriage through Updike's
ever-wise eyes.
   ``S.'' is actually Updike's third telling of ``The Scarlet
Letter.'' His 1975 novel, ``A Month of Sundays,'' was the Rev.
Dimmesdale's version in modern dress; his last novel, ``Roger's
Version,'' portrayed the cuckolded husband, Roger Chillingsworth.
Sarah Worth, the protagonist of ``S.,'' finally tells us Hester
Prynne's side of the story.
   Updike talked about his 13th novel during a recent visit to New
York from his Beverly, Mass., home. Wearing a writer's gray tweed
jacket and exuding boyish energy, the 56-year-old Pulitzer Prize
winner sat behind a desk in a vacant office at his publisher's,
fidgeting with a paper clip and pondering why he is so captivated
with the subject of adultery.
   ``It fascinates a lot of novelists. Somebody once said that
without adultery you don't have the novel. It used to be ... the
only way in which a woman became a revolutionary. It was a
high-energy transaction. It was the way in which marriage, which
was the basis of the bourgeois social order, was betrayed,'' said
Updike.
   For men, the author noted, adultery was part of the social
order: ``There were mistresses built into the system. There were
brothels built into the system, so that in a way the male adulterer
does not seem to be as conflicted or as passionate or as troubled
or as vulnerable a creature as the adulteress.''
   In ``S.,'' Sarah, a middle-aged New England housewife, flees her
inattentive doctor husband (after taking amply from their joint
bank accounts) to join a religious commune in Arizona that bears
more than a passing resemblance to the now-dismantled Rajneeshpuram
in Oregon. Her imperial air and Seven Sisters pedigree quickly gain
her entrance into the guru's inner circle, where she becomes a kind
of personal secretary and bookkeeper.
   ``There is a way in which Sarah is a `wicked woman,' kind of
selfish and heedless and cavalier; she's no saint,'' Updike said of
his protagonist. ``But there is a way in which Hester Prynne is not
a saint initially either. When we see her as a young woman, she's
kind of sassy, really.''
   Asked if the reader is supposed to like Sarah, this ``wicked
woman,'' Updike laughed and replied shyly, ``It'd be nice if you
would. I'd be grateful. I like her ... because she's energetic and
also purposeful. She's no slouch. Tossed out into the world she
does pretty well in it.
   ``I think what we like in fiction is life. And the novelist's
hope is to imbue the characters with life rather than virtue.
Dickens had a nice way of getting us really enthusiastic about
virtuous characters. I'm not sure that in the late 20th century we
can make people that pure.''
   Updike, born in Shillington, Pa., educated at Harvard
University, and a Massachusetts resident for the past three
decades, has published 19 other books _ collections of poems,
essays and short stories _ in addition to the novels. He is also
the foreign books reviewer for the New Yorker.
   The author has mined a prolific career out of his study of
male-female relationships. He is probably best known for creating
the ribald Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom in 1960's ``Rabbit, Run,''
bringing him back a decade later in ``Rabbit Redux'' and again in
1981's ``Rabbit Is Rich,'' which won him a Pulitzer, an American
Book Award and a National Book Critics Circle Award.
   Updike has come under fire for his handling of female characters
in the ``Rabbit'' trilogy as well as some of his other work. In a
recent New York Times interview he said he wrote ``S.'' to satisfy
his ``feminist detractors.''
   ``I'm almost sorry I used that phrase,'' Updike said. ``In fact,
women tend to review my books more understandingly and kindly than
men. In `The Witches of Eastwick' (with three female protagonists)
the women reviewers were much more amused with it than some of the
men. ... But I suppose I was impressed by the feminist point that
many women in my books have tended to be dependent and seen to a
large degree as sex objects. So in my clumsy way I'm trying to make
female protagonists who are the center of the action.''
   ``S.'' is an epistolary novel, in which the story is told
through letters Sarah writes to her husband, daughter, mother,
friends, even her dentist and hairdresser. The convention usually
doesn't allow for dialogue but Updike cleverly circumvents this
constraint by having Sarah conceal a tape recorder in her clothes.
   Although the epistolary form has built-in limitations, Updike
said, ``It's a blessing in a way because it spares you some of the
carpentry work of the third-person novel.''
   ``I've always been a realistic writer who treasures getting the
furniture and clothes right. I had to abjure a lot of that detail.
Probably good for me, sort of a cleansing operation.''
   Even in a breezy satire such as ``S.'' Updike's prose is
luminescent. He is America's premiere stylist, writing with a
precision and lushness that borders on the rococo in his
descriptions of the Arizona terrain or of Sarah's beloved New
England garden.
   Updike was once called a ``creator of moral fables.'' He was
asked if that label fit.
   ``I think of my books as being more moral investigations,'' he
said. ``I try to raise the question of what is morality and what is
goodness, more than to offer a definition. I think any novel to be
alive must fluctuate somewhat in its moral standpoint; maybe
fluctuate is the wrong word, but it should have ambiguity built
into it. It should make the reader think a bit, surprise him a bit,
make him investigate his own life, rather than present him with
villains and heros and a good way and a bad way.''
