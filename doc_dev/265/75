   A horse-drawn wagon that appeared in the
burning-of-Atlanta scene in the movie ``Gone With The Wind'' will
be up for sale Saturday, along with the buckboard from the TV
series ``The Rifleman.''
   The ``Gone With The Wind'' water wagon was seen dashing across
the street behind Scarlet O'Hara and Rhett Butler. Also on the
auction block alongside other props will be a gypsy wagon used in a
few Laurel and Hardy movies.
   The items will be among an assortment of 23 Hollywood
horse-drawn hitches and other Old West paraphernalia.
   Joe and Anna Belle Nimmo, who have been collecting horse-drawn
carriages for years, are selling out and everything must go.
   ``We no longer have the strength to take care of them,'' said
Mrs. Nimmo. ``It's just become a bit much. My husband is 70, and
I'm 49. We don't want them to disintegrate, and we want people to
take care of them.''
   For a few years, the Nimmos rented their carriages for parades
and weddings. When they tired of hauling the carriages around town
they built an Old West town facade on their 12{-acre ranch and
started filming TV commercials.
   ``When you get the people in costumes, and the vehicles, and the
horses, and stand back and look, you'd swear you were in the Old
West,'' Mrs. Nimmo said.
   ``It's such fun, it really is,'' she said. ``I hate to see it
depart from my life.''
   Also for sale are a mint condition Hollywood stage coach, used
in an unknown number of Westerns; the coronation coach that carried
Norma Shearer in the 1938 movie ``Marie Antoinette;'' and a landau
that carried participants in Queen Elizabeth II's real coronation
parade in 1952.
   The Nimmos can't document many of the histories of their
coaches, but say they bought many right off movie studio lots and
studio executives told them of the vehicles' film roles.
   ``Prices range up to $35,000,'' Mrs. Nimmo said. ``If that stage
coach were real and not a replica, it could bring $100,000.''
