<LEADPARA>  AGAINST ALL odds and in spite of the literary critics, the "Gone With the
Wind" sequel from Warner Books, "Scarlett," is going through the roof all over
the world. Now Pocket Books will latch onto the trend with a sizzling sequel
to another all-time classic and love story. They've landed the rights to "H .
. . The Story of Heathcliff." This first novel by Lin Haire-Sargeant will fill
in the missing three years in Emily Bronte's timeless classic, "Wuthering
Heights.";   It will allow an entirely new and passionate conclusion to the
tempestuous literary love affair of Heathcliff and Cathy. Maybe they won't
have to go off wandering hand in hand across the moors as ghostly lovers, as
Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon did in the famous Samuel Goldwyn version,
circa 1939.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pocket Books is so enthusiastic, it has made a pre-emptive six-figure bid
to acquire worldwide English rights. The very-much-under-wraps manuscript will
be kept a secret until its hardcover publication in the summer of 1992.;  
Yes, of course, there is much movie and TV interest. Aside from the
above-mentioned classic, "Wuthering Heights" has spawned at least four film
versions.; From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;   CHANGE OF
VENUE? Andy Griffith, whose "Matlock" series returns to the weekly lineup this
Friday, isn't too pleased with that placement.;   Last spring, when Griffith
learned the show was being put on the shelf until it could be used to replace
a failing series this fall, he extracted a promise from NBC CEO Robert Wright
that when the show was taken off the bench, Griffith relates, "we'd get a
decent time slot. I don't want us to go out as losers.";   Griffith, currently
shooting episode 10 of what he vows will definitely be his final 22 segments
of the show, says that instead of what he was promised, "We're being used
where they've got some weak spots . . . hoping we can plug up some holes.";  
The show comes out of mothballs this week with the two-hour drama "Matlock:
The Witness Killings." Griffith likes the show but says, "I personally hate
that title; it was originally called 'The Homecoming,' and that's what it is
-- about Matlock going back to his childhood home. There are two murders, yes,
but there's also an enormous amount of comedy, dance and music.";   He goes on
to say, "The second show will be a thriller, and the third segment is an out
and out comedy. We decided that as long as we were going to do a sixth year,
we wouldn't do just formula shows with a courtroom ending. Instead we'd
stretch and do some things different. I'm very happy with the way they're
turning out.";   HARD SELL: Joan Rivers is not only going to hype her "Still
Talking" autobiography in newspapers and magazines, she's also going to
interview herself via split screen on "The Joan Rivers" show the week of Oct.
28 -- the week of the book's release. She promises, "I'm going to ask myself
all the questions nobody else dares to. I may even walk off, I'll be so
angry.";   But seriously, says Rivers, the follow-up to her 1986 "Enter
Talking" autobiography details such trying times as her very public
falling-out with Johnny Carson, the axing of her late-night show by Fox; and
her husband Edgar Rosenberg's death by suicide in 1987. "I started writing the
book two and a half years ago and it was a great catharsis," says Rivers. She
says she couldn't have written the book without her daughter Melissa's
support. "We talked about it beforehand and I made her read the book as I
wrote it. I was worried about what she would think about my covering Edgar's
suicide and the havoc it caused in our family . .  she and I weren't getting
along afterward. But she was wonderful. When I was through, she said 'It was a
very painful read, but terrific -- do what you want, Mom.' "  </TEXT>
