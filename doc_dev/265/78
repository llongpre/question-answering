   Frankly, many may not care very much. But it is
the 50th anniversary of some of Hollywood's greatest movies,
beginning with ``Gone With the Wind.''
   Those who do care, however, are in for a nostalgic treat.
Publishers, never shy about commemorating an anniversary of any
sort, have gone all out for this admittedly special year.
   A simple listing of the films made in 1939 that have become
classics would make a book in itself, which is about what Ted
Sennett has done in ``Hollywood's Golden Year'' (St. Martin's
Press, $29.95). There's ``Gone With the Wind,'' of course, but also
``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,''
``Stagecoach,'' ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``Gunga Din,'' ``Ninotchka''
and many others. All at the theaters when movie admission prices
were about a quarter.
   ``Gone With the Wind'' still is the most popular, and in keeping
with the epic proportions of the film, most of the books are
cinemascope-sized and priced.
   In addition to Sennett's book, there is ``The Art of Gone With
the Wind: The Making of a Legend,'' by Judy Cameron and Paul J.
Christian (Prentice Hall Press, $39.95); ``Scarlett's Women: Gone
With the Wind and Its Female Fans,'' by Helen Taylor (Rutgers
University Press, $35); ``Gone With the Wind'' by Herb Bridges and
Terryl C. Boodman (Fireside-Simon and Schuster, $24.95), described
as the ``definitive illustrated history of the book, the movie and
the legend.''
   Not to be outdone, fans of ``The Wizard of Oz'' can choose from
a Kansas-size field of books, topped by ``The Wizard of Oz: The
Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History,'' by John Fricke, Jay
Scarfone, and William Stillman (Warner Books, $29.95).It contains
400 illustrations, half in color, including some previously
undiscovered stills _ and an advertisement for an anniversary
videocassette of the movie.
   For film fans whose library is saturated with 1939 memorabilia,
there are others to put atop the coffee table, including ``Jean
Howard's Hollywood: A Photo Memoir'' (Harry N. Abrams, $39.95);
``David Lean,'' by Stephen M. Silverman (Harry N. Abrams, $39.95),
and ``Bad Girls of the Silver Screen,'' by Lottie Da and Jan
Alexander (Carroll and Graf, $25.95).
