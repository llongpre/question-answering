   Actress Kathleen Turner is fighting termination
of her cooperative apartment house lease because she allegedly
sublet her apartment to her sister-in-law without the board's
permission.
   The star of ``Body Heat,'' ``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Peggy
Sue Got Married'' now lives with her husband, Jay Weiss, in a
townhouse in the city's Greenwich Village. After a year of being
unable to find a buyer for her old apartment, they decided to
sublet it and asked the cooperative board's permission.
   Turner said in court papers she got no reply, so a year later
she renewed her request, naming her sister-in-law as a subtenant.
   On May 1, the sister-in-law and her husband moved into Turner's
apartment. On May 2, the board notified Turner she had violated
co-op rules and threatened to terminate her apartment lease. Turner
moved in court to block the eviction. A hearing scheduled for
Thursday was adjourned until June 29.

   American writer Jerzy Kosinski rolled through
the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights in a tank and said the
Palestinian uprising will forge a new political balance in the
Middle East.
   ``The intefadeh (Arabic for uprising) will have to run its
course, and a new balance will have to emerge,'' Kosinski told The
Associated Press after visiting a tank brigade Thursday in the
northern Golan Heights. ``This is history's balancing act. It is a
powerful test for a powerful democracy like Israel.''
   The uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip erupted in December 1987 and has claimed at least 482
Palestinian and 21 Israeli lives.
   During his visit, Kosinski sat in the driver's seat of a tank,
then was driven around in the vehicle. The Polish-born author,
who's written ``Being There'' among other novels, said he had not
been that close to a tank since the Soviets invaded Poland.
   ``The tank gave me a feeling of fear,'' he said.

   Actor Doug McClure will receive the
1989 Buffalo Bill Award for family entertainment now that
Nebraskaland Days has changed its schedule and two airlines have
donated air fare to ensure he gets there.
   McClure was originally scheduled to attend a brunch June 23, and
receive the award at a rodeo that night. But his agent told
festival organizers he might be unable to attend because of
conflicts with a filming schedule in California.
   Executive Director Kim Adle said Thursday the brunch was
canceled and the award rescheduled for the rodeo June 24. McClure
will also ride in a parade that day in North Platte, which for many
years was the hometown of ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody.
   The Buffalo Bill Award was given last year to actor Bruce
Boxleitner.

   Best-selling French author Regine Deforges says
there is no chance a French court will rule in favor of Margaret
Mitchell's heirs in their $750,000 plagiarism lawsuit against her.
   ``France is one country in the world where authors are protected
in their right of free expression,'' The Atlanta Constitution
quoted Ms. Deforges as saying Thursday. ``For them, plagiarism does
not exist. If you take an idea from somebody else, that is all it
is _ an idea.''
   Ms. Deforges, 53, said Miss Mitchell's 1936 epic ``Gone With the
Wind'' inspired her novel, ``The Blue Bicycle.'' Miss Mitchell died
in 1949.
   The Trust Co. of Georgia, executors of Miss Mitchell's estate,
and Miss Mitchell's nephews, Joseph and Eugene Mitchell, are suing
Ms. Deforges for ``exploitation and infringement'' of the novel.
   Ms. Deforges' novel is the story of Lea, a French grape grower's
daughter who serves as a courier for the French Resistance during
World War II. The novel has sold millions of copies in France. Miss
Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is the story of Scarlett
O'Hara, a Georgia cotton grower's daughter who gets caught up in
the Civil War.

   Painter-pop artist James Rosenquist is suing
the Internal Revenue Service for return of $75,000 in interest he
feels he overpaid the agency because of a lengthy audit.
   Rosenquist, 55, claims in a federal complaint that the IRS
passed his audit off to several agents over nearly seven years,
losing his case files in the process and resulting in a large
overpayment.
   The suit, originally filed in New York in March, was transferred
to U.S. District Court in Tampa at the government's request. The
artist has a home on the Gulf Coast northeast of Tampa.
   ``Three or four years would be normal,'' said Larry Kars, his
New York lawyer. ``But seven is too long, and that's what we're
complaining about.''
   IRS spokeswoman Ann Carroll said federal privacy laws forbid the
government to comment.

   Hedda Nussbaum, the battered woman who testified
against Joel Steinberg in the death of their illegally adopted
6-year-old daughter, has been released from a psychiatric hospital
and moved to an apartment.
   One of Nussbaum's lawyers, Betty Levinson, said Thursday that
Nussbaum was discharged several weeks ago and is in outpatient
therapy. She attends weekly meetings of a support group for
battered women, Levinson said.
   Steinberg, Nussbaum's former live-in companion, was convicted
earlier this year of manslaughter and sentenced to up to 25 years
in prison in Lisa's death.
   Charges against Nussbaum, who made the cover of Newsweek as the
case got national attention, were dropped after prosecutors
concluded that she had been so severely beaten by Steinberg that
she was unable to aid the child.
   Nussbaum, a former children's book editor, is on disability
insurance until she finds a job, Levinson said. She has also filed
a $3 million suit against Steinberg and sold the TV rights to her
story, reportedly for $100,000.
