   Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh have long since
died, but at the gala events this week celebrating the 50th
anniverary of ``Gone With the Wind'' they'll be remembered again
and again.
   For one thing, organizers have invited five pairs of Rhett
Butler and Scarlett O'Hara look-alikes.
   For another, 11 survving cast members, many of whom were
children when the 1939 movie was made, will have their own stories
to tell of the legendary stars, who both died in the 1960s.
   The cast members will attend a private reunion Thursday and are
expected Friday night at a re-creation of the movie's Dec. 15,
1939, world premiere.
   Fifty years ago, the premiere was the biggest social event in
the city's history. The governor declared Dec. 15 a holiday, and an
estimated 1 million people turned out to catch glimpses of the
visiting Hollywood royalty and Atlanta's own Margaret Mitchell, the
former newspaper writer whose 1936 novel ``Gone With the Wind''
catapulted her to reluctant celebrity.
   The ``re-premiere'' will be held at the Fox Theater since the
Loew's Grand Theater, site of the 1939 premiere, is no longer
standing.
   A competition between the Rhett and Scarlett look-alikes is set
for Tuesday, and guests in antebellum dress will attend a ``Gone
With the Wind'' ball Thursday night.
   Cammie King Conlon, the actress who played Rhett and Scarlett's
young daughter, Bonnie Blue Butler, said the cast reunion will be a
chance for her to reminisce with others who appeared in the movie.
   ``I was 4{ when they did the filming,'' the Little River,
Calif., resident said in a telephone interview, adding that she
remembers ``about 12 snapshots, images'' of the experience.
   ``You don't really know how much you remember because people
have told you some things,'' she said. ``I certainly remember the
pony.'' In the movie, as in the book, Bonnie dies in a fall from a
pony.
   ``Clark Gable I remember being a very nice, nice `daddy,''' Ms.
Conlon added. ``He was considerate of me, my mother said. I don't
remember Vivien Leigh at all.''
   Others expected for the cast reunion include Butterfly McQueen,
who played Prissy; Patrick Curtis, Ric Holt and Mickey Kuhn, all of
whom played Beau Wilkes, son of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes, at
various ages; Gregg Geiss, who played Bonnie Blue as an infant; and
Ann Rutherford and Evelyn Keyes, who portrayed Scarlett's sisters.
   Many of the anniversary activities are sponsored by Turner Home
Entertainment, a division of entrepreneur Ted Turner's media empire.
   Turner acquired the rights to ``Gone With the Wind'' in 1985
when he bought MGM-UA Entertainment Corp.'s huge film library. He
paid for a restored version of the film that has made a 50th
anniversary tour of U.S. movie houses this year.
   ``It's his favorite movie,'' said Frank Miller, a Turner
spokesman.
   Other activities include a champagne breakfast, which is a
re-creation of an event from the 1939 gala; tours of historic homes
in Atlanta and suburban Clayton County, where Miss Mitchell set her
fictional plantation Tara; an exhibit at the Atlanta Historical
Society; and lectures on Miss Mitchell, who died in 1949, and her
book.
   Turner's SuperStation TBS will broadcast the restored version of
the film three times during the week.
