BALZAC by Graham Robb Picador Pounds 20, 521 pages
STENDHAL by Jonathan Keates Sinclair Stevenson Pounds 20, 446 pages
Oscar Wilde called him the inventor of the 19th century. To English eyes, he
has always been the French writer who most embodies our love affair with
decadent, romantic, venal Paris. The small fat man who stalked the faubourgs
for inspiration about everyday life and so became the father of the
realistic novel, Balzac is the voice of pre-1848 France as surely as Dickens
speaks for Victorian England.
This is the first English biography for 50 years. It reaffirms the Balzac
myth with all the detail and domestic precision of the Comedie Humaine
novels and it has a splendid story to tell. Born in 1799 in Tours, Balzac
was an object of instant dislike to his 20-year-old mother, who put him out
to nurse, ignored him while she pursued her lovers and sent him to a
boarding school which did not believe in holidays. From the ages of eight to
14, he saw his family twice.
But in 1813, his headmaster demanded that he be removed at once. Almost
comatose, unable to speak, thin and puny, it then emerged that Balzac had
passed much of his school years locked up either in a dungeon or in a
cupboard under the stairs. He had done little classwork but had devoured
every book in the school library. In a horrible way, the pattern of his life
was set. When he wrote his novels, he always wore a monk's habit and sat in
a darkened room with only a coffee-pot, to make sure he kept awake, as a
prop.
His parents moved to Paris and at 19 Balzac persuaded them to fund him as a
writer. Bourgeoise respectability dictated the deal. Balzac was secretly set
up in a room on the edge of the Marais, friends were told he had gone south
to work; he promised only to come out at night and to keep to the suburbs.
'In listening to these people, I could espouse their lives. I felt their
rags upon my back; I walked with my feet in their tattered shoes; their
desires, their wants - everything passed into my soul,' he said of those
nocturnal walks.
After a few pot-boilers, he wrote the first of the hundred or so tales of
Parisian and provincial life - Le Pere Goriot, La Cousine Bette - that make
up the Comedie Humaine. They were instantly successful and soon he was the
most famous novelist in France.
A good literary biography has at its heart the flow between the life and
work, the key impulses towards fictional creation. In Balzac's case, they
were consciously bound up with sexual energy - he told Dumas that a night of
love cost half a volume and that 'no woman alive is worth two volumes a
year.' His books are laced with the battle between desire and ascetism. The
hero of The Magic Skin has opera glasses equipped with a monocle which turns
sexiness to ugliness, and so watches the beautiful women on stage without
yearning. But Balzac's major figures are corrupt sensualists, androgynes
like Vautrin, Rastignac and de Rubrempre, who had a profound influence on
fin -de-siecle decadence - Rubrempre's death, said Wilde, was 'one of the
greatest tragedies of my life.'
Robb probes the psychological depths of neither the man nor the novels.
Instead, he loses his subject in a whirl of social climbing, adulterous
aristocrats and possible illegitimate children. Only the turning point of
Balzac's life cuts through this morass. In 1832, he received a fan's letter
from Odessa signed L'Etrangere. He was so taken by it that he placed an
answer in the Gazette de France. Fifteen years of love letters and rare
meetings with Madame Hanska, a Polish countess, followed.
Love and money play on each other throughout the Comedie Humaine, and so in
life. 'All my other passions were just a deposit for this one,' Balzac said.
He lived well and overspent; when her husband died Mme Hanska held off from
him because he lacked the financial acumen of his characters.
After years of madcap trips to Poland mixed with 18-hour working days, he
married her. Five months later he was dead. 'I always found them sitting by
the fireside and they talked and talked until morning. Whatever could they
find to talk about for so long?' recalled the valet who brought them coffee
in the small hours. Anecdotes like these are the high points of an
enthusiastic but flawed biography.
Balzac, Zola and Flaubert are all popular classics in England but among
French 19th century novelists, none is regarded with more suspicion here
than Stendhal. Balzac called Stendhal the Machiavelli of the 19th century
and for the English, Stendhal's reputation as a grey and difficult Gallic
literary anatomist is one that not even last year's bodice-ripping
television version of Scarlet and Black managed to overcome.
This stunning new biography will change our view of Stendhal for good. In
the 'vast, gorgeous tracts' of Stendhal's life as a Napoleonic soldier and
lover, Jonathan Keates sees a complex man whose sensuality and 'massively
humane curiosity' lay behind every line he wrote.
Here is Stendhal whose great panoramic novel, Scarlet and Black and The
Charterhouse of Parma, emerged out of his own passions and disappointments
and are warm human dramas. Keates makes clear how Stendhal's revolutionary
bridging of the gap between Romanticism and 19th century realistic fiction
had much to do with a temperament torn between nostalgia and cynicism. This
is an exhilarating portrait; sensitive, original, perfectly pitched between
art and life.
Stendhal was born Henri Deyle in 1783 and it is as a figure formed by 18th
century values that Keates depicts him. He came from a well-off Grenoble
family, slipped into a post in the Ministry of War, and from 1800 followed
Napoleon's campaign in Italy and Austria. He was small, ugly and obsessed by
physical beauty in others, and he spent most of his time in salons and opera
houses, pursuing aristocratic hostesses and singers. After the fall of
Napoleon he retired to Italy, adopted his pseudonym and began to write. At
59, unmarried, syphilitic and obscure, he dropped dead in a Paris street.
At once refined and emotionally wild, Stendhal sings out from these pages
like a character from a Mozart opera. He was, says Keates, a sexual
freebooter who 'found a notion of obtaining happiness from a virtuous woman
wholly inconceivable.' Often he played Don Giovanni - driven by sexual
intrigue, he marked the date of conquests on his braces, and recorded them
in a secret code. He bribed maids, hid in trunks to spy on unfaithful
mistresses, hung towels from his balcony to tell lovers when it was safe.
But despite the opera buffo roles it was a series of tortured unconsummated
obsessions which fuelled his art. Alexandrine was the muse for Gina de
Sanseverina in The Charterhouse of Parma. A fixation on a high-handed
Italian countess called Metilda inspired his heroine Mathilde de la Mole.
War and love made up his life, but he was neither greatly successful nor
ambitious in either, and Keates suggests that it was a backwards glance at
his roving existence which created the ambivalent tone of Scarlet and Black
(1830).
A lifetime's emotions tumbled out in this novel. The mercantile mayor was
modelled on his greedy father; elusive Madame de Renal on his adored mother.
The opera fanatic's penchant for romantic theatricality battles with
Stendhal the cool modernist, who wins out. The moral of Scarlet and Black is
that 'the men we honour are simply rogues who have been lucky enough not to
get caught red-handed'.
Stendhal saw his novel as a journey down the highway which reflected the
'blue of the skies and the mire of the road below'. Keates marvellously
captures both aspects of the man and his work.
