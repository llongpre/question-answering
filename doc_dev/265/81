<LEADPARA>  SOME people think what Madonna wanted most to end 1991 was to play the leading
romantic role opposite William Baldwin in the coming movie "Baboon Heart," the
story of a New Jersey waitress who falls for a strange dishwasher, a man who
believes he has been transplanted with the heart of an ape.;   Madonna met
with director Tony Bill and also with Alan Ladd Jr. and executives of
MGM-Pathe. She sent them tapes of herself and made a number of energetic
telephone calls. But when push came to shove, Madonna refused to test for the
role.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Word has it that although MGM-Pathe was interested in starring her, they
did not feel certain enough to do so without a test. "We know she can play
herself and even reinvent herself over and over. But we don't know if she can
carry a movie as the co-star and remain in character." Or quotes to that
effect.;   QUITE A CAST: Columbia Pictures confirms that it will begin
production in March on "The Age of Innocence," a Martin Scorsese picture
starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daniel Day Lewis and Winona Ryder.;   The filming
of the Edith Wharton Pulitzer prize-winning novel, set in the 1870s, will
bring Scorsese back to Columbia for the first time since his classic "Taxi
Driver.";   QUITE A CAST II: This year's list of Kennedy Center honorees
boasts Gregory Peck, Roy Acuff, the Nicholas Brothers and Betty Comden and
Adolph Green. The TV special airs Dec. 26.;   Keith Carradine and Susan Anton
will lead the 36-member cast of Broadway's hot musical ticket, "The Will
Rogers Follies," in opening the national TV production with a number from
their show. Producer Pierre Cossette flies his gang down to Washington on an
early-bird flight for rehearsal Friday.; From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel
Smith in Hollywood;   SCARLETT LETTERS: Simon and Schuster expects to have
100,000-plus copies of its audio version of "Scarlett" -- featuring the voice
of "Designing Women" star Dixie Carter -- in stores by Friday. That's a record
first release for S&amp;S Audio, which, of course, figures it can cash in in a big
way with the audio of the Alexandra Ripley book that's been riding high on the
best-seller lists for nine weeks.;   ROAD TRIP: Charles Kuralt says he's
returning to the place he loves best -- the road. The veteran CBS
correspondent has logged more than a million miles exploring the heart and
soul of America for his Emmy-winning "On the Road" series. He notes it's been
a year "since I was getting ready to go back to the road and the Gulf War
started and CBS called me back to do a new nightly news show with Lesley
Stahl. Now I'm ready to go 'On the Road' again. I miss that old bus.";   Since
Desert Storm ended, the veteran newscaster has spent most of his time
preparing for CBS's two-hour special Friday commemorating the 50th anniversary
of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Kuralt co-hosts with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
He says that working with the general turned out to be a dream.;   "He's born
to do this kind of work -- very knowledgeable, eloquent and frank.";  
Schwarzkopf and Kuralt were each 7 years old when the Japanese struck.  </TEXT>
