   Famed Kenyan flyer Beryl Markham possessed
the grace of the African animals she grew up with, and, her
admirers admit, at times was as cunning and ruthless.
   ``Beryl Markham: A Shadow on the Sun,'' CBS' four-hour
miniseries starring Stefanie Powers as the famed aviator and author
of ``West With the Night,'' a stirring account of life in colonial
Africa, airs Sunday and Tuesday.
   ``She was as much the Scarlett O'Hara of British East Africa as
she was a well-liked African Queen of the bushland,'' said Mary
Lovell, author of ``Straight On Till Morning,'' the 1987 biography
of Markham.
   Markham, tall, slender, self-possessed, fascinated people drawn
to her fearless, Garboesque nature throughout her life. Her solo
flight across the Atlantic in 1936 _ the first from east to west _
made her an international heroine.
   The miniseries, which is actually based on a Vanity Fair article
by James Fox, traces Markham's life from childhood in British East
Africa, where she hunted wild pig with Nandi tribesmen. She became
the continent's first female bush pilot and a renowned thoroughbred
horse trainer.
   According to her biographer, Markham angered and even frightened
people with an imperious and pedantic nature.
   ``People either utterly loved or loathed her,'' said Lovell, in
a recent interview from her home in England.
   As if to make that point, the movie details Markham's often
disastrous personal life, including three failed marriages and love
affairs with flyer Tom Campbell Black and Denys Finch-Hatton, the
English elephant hunter played by Robert Redford in ``Out of
Africa.''
   In her critically acclaimed memoirs, ``West With the Night,''
first published in 1942, Markham was praised as having a ``poet's
feeling for her land.'' But preoccupied with the advent of World
War II, the American public virtually ignored the book.
   Following its rediscovery by Marin County, Calif., restaurateur
George Gutekunst, the book was republished in 1983. By May 7 it had
sold 500,000 copies; it was listed on the New York Times
best-seller list for 79 weeks.
   In some areas, fascination with Markham approaches cult status,
according to Bernice Green, a New York publicist for CBS.
   ``I can't believe that this was a woman who did what she did
more than 50 years ago,'' said Green.
   Kenya in the 1920s and 1930s was a haven for titled Europeans,
and Markham lived among the upper class, which earned the nickname
``The Happy Valley Set'' in British newspapers because of their
relatively loose morals.
   Those who knew Markham described her as possessing an enchanting
beauty. Critic Judith Thurman writes that ``to the common
imagination she was a sort of Circe,'' referring to the Greek
mythological enchantress who turned men into beasts.
   Gutekunst said he was taken aback when he met Markham in Kenya
for the first time. Ever the flirt, she took to calling him
``Georgie-Porgie,'' borrowing from the nursery rhyme in which the
boy ``kissed the girls and made them cry.''
   ``I called her the Garbo of East Africa, not just because she
really was beautiful at her age, even when I first met her at 82,
but because of her carriage, her long swan-like neck, the mystery,
the confidence,'' said Gutekunst.
   Markham soared west across the Atlantic in 1936, becoming the
first person to fly solo from England to North America, where she
crash-landed in a bog in Nova Scotia. She then fell into obscurity.
   But not before tumultuous years in the United States, where she
worked as a consultant for Hollywood producers, married a heavy
drinker, published her biography and worked intermittently as a
short-story writer.
   Markham was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in England,
and was brought to a farm in Kenya by her divorced father, retired
British Army Capt. Charles B. Clutterbuck.
   She had less than four years of formal education, but said her
father made her read widely. Later she was given a crash course in
literature and music by Finch-Hatton, the Oxford-educated
aristocrat and lover of Danish Baroness Karen Blixen, who wrote as
Isak Dinesen.
   By 1936, several planes had crossed the Atlantic westward from
Europe, but all had at least two people aboard. Markham, in a
single-engine Percival Gull monoplane, departed Britain's Abingdon
Royal Air Force aerodrome on Sept. 4.
   Despite crash-landing because of low fuel, she was given a
ticker-tape parade in New York, her original goal. Markham died in
Nairobi in 1986 at the age of 83.
