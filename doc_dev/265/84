</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The list of 25 films cited as national treasures by the Library of Congress 
Tuesday seems to have been careful not to favor particular genres or directors. 
John Ford, Billy Wilder and Victor Fleming had two films each on the list, 
while James Stewart and Humphrey Bogart were the only actors to have more than 
one film on the list. Seventeen of the movies were filmed in black-and-white, 
and six were silent.

and "As Time Goes By." Everybody's late-night black-and-white favorite, already 
colorized with a disclaimer by Ted Turner.

mob.
