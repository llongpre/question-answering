<LEADPARA>  SURPRISE! ABC's "Sinatra" miniseries -- produced by Tina Sinatra, with input
from her father, Frank -- will not be, as many expected, an
all-potatoes-and-no-meat look upon his life.;   We've gotten an advance peek
at the script synopsis for the Warner Bros. project that's slated to start
production early next year for broadcast sometime in the '92 season. And
according to what we've read, the five-hour drama will delve into some of the
most controversial, even dark, aspects of Sinatra's life.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Included will be scenes delving into his mob connections, his womanizing
ways, his arrest on a morals charge (for getting a woman pregnant) while he
was engaged to marry first wife Nancy.;   Even his beloved late mother, Dolly,
will not be spared. Her arrest "for performing illegal operations" in the
early days is included in the screenplay.;   Before the story is through,
we'll be taken into the back rooms of the Chicago mobs who were convinced by
Frank Sinatra to use their clout in the JFK presidential election, according
to the script. We'll see that Rat Pack member Sammy Davis Jr., a tireless,
highly visible worker for Kennedy, was quietly ordered to postpone his
marriage to a white woman (Mai Britt) until after JFK's election. We'll have
mobster Sam Giancana ordering the Rat Pack to make appearances in his
nightclub.;   Perhaps most moving will be the portrait painted of Sinatra's
wife, Nancy, who's left alone when their first two children are born, who
suffers as Sinatra flaunts affairs with such beauties as Lana Turner, Marilyn
Maxwell and Ava Gardner (later his second wife).;   Nope, Frank doesn't come
out a hero in "Sinatra." It sounds, in fact, as if he sometimes comes out a
heel.;    FRANKLY, THEY GIVE A DAMN: An Oct. 25 deadline has been set for bids
on dramatic rights to "Scarlett," the runaway best-selling sequel to "Gone
With the Wind." Offers have already been received from some dozen different
film and TV production entities "in the substantial seven figures," reports
Robert Gottlieb, head of William Morris' literary department. He adds that
"companies are bidding in partnership because the money is so high . . . We
have international consortiums bidding . . . It's bound to be an international
buy." "Scarlett" is certainly proving to be an international sell. In spite of
scads of ravaging reviews, the book has reportedly become the top seller in 20
different countries.;   VIDEOLAND VIEW: The set where "My Son Johnny" was shot
was hardly a happy place. Michele Lee, who co-stars with Rick Schroder and
Corin Nemec in the Nov. 10 CBS TV movie about a mother whose youngest son
kills his sibling after being a victim of his brother's ongoing brutality,
reveals the shoot was "very difficult, very painful for all of us. When actors
do something like we did, they conjure up parts of their lives that were
painful and live them while on the sound stage."  </TEXT>
