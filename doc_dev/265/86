   Margaret Mitchell called it ``The Dump.'' And in
its current state, the apartment where she wrote much of ``Gone
With The Wind'' shows the effects of care by those who, frankly,
couldn't give a damn.
   The three-story brick and stucco building sits in the middle of
a muddy lot in midtown Atlanta. Its windows are broken or boarded,
its roof is sunken and torn, its walls are sooty.
   But a group with $850,000 in financial backing wants to save the
74-year-old building, saying it represents possibly the last chance
for Atlanta to properly honor one of its most celebrated residents.
   Developers, on the other hand, say ``The Dump'' can't be
restored and should be razed to create a park to complement a
recent flurry of construction in the neighborhood.
   Miss Mitchell and her husband, John Marsh, rented a first-floor
apartment at what was then called Windsor House Apartments from
1926 to 1932. She was killed in a 1949 automobile accident 13 years
after her epic novel of the Old South and Reconstruction was
published.
   The fate of the building is in federal court. Trammell Crow Co.,
which purchased the property in 1985, sued the city in January
after Mayor Andrew Young refused to sign a demolition permit for
the apartment building. Young had said he would support demolition
as a last resort, but the preservationist group came along and
Young agreed to try to save the building.
   Trammell Crow had begun landscaping work around the building.
Meanwhile, the group, Mitchell House Inc., is drumming up support
for a Mitchell memorial project.
   John Taylor, president of the group, says most of the other
Atlanta sites where Miss Mitchell lived have been destroyed,
leaving few physical reminders of the writer.
   `This is one of our last opportunities,'' he said.
   Taylor said wants to restore the building to the way it was in
Miss Mitchell's time, display the apartment where she did her
writing and establish a writer-in-residence program.
   While previous attempts at ``Gone With The Wind'' attractions
focused on the popular 1939 movie, Taylor said the apartment
project would emphasize Miss Mitchell's book.
   ``We'd like to keep the literary aspect in the forefront,'' he
said.
   The literary emphasis also would keep the project from becoming
merely a tourist attraction, he said, though the lack of a major
``Gone With The Wind'' center in Atlanta is a major impetus for the
effort.
   Taylor said the restoration effort has raised about $850,000 in
cash, pledges and pledged services. He said it also has the
endorsement from Miss Mitchell's only remaining heirs _ two nephews.
   Among the opponents are those who were acquainted with Miss
Mitchell and say she would be against the memorial.
   ``I'm opposed to saving what she called `The Dump' because
Margaret Mitchell herself told me on several occasions that she
wanted no museums or landmarks preserved in her memory,'' columnist
Celestine Sibley wrote recently in The Atlanta Constitution.
   But Taylor said there are many misconceptions about Miss
Mitchell, and the project would offer a chance to clarify her
background. And the recent announcement that a ``Gone With The
Wind'' sequel is being written by a Virginia author will generate
even more interest, he added.
   John Decker, marketing principal at Trammel Crow, said the
developer sponsored two studies of the site before deciding that
restoring the apartment was not feasible.
   One study, he said, found that the deterioration of the building
was worse than expected. The other concluded that the funds needed
for the project _ an estimated $2 million _ would not be available.
   If Trammel Crow's plans proceed, the park would have a
historical marker designating the site as the location of Miss
Mitchell's one-time residence, Decker said. Any surviving or
significant items from the building would be saved for inclusion in
a possible traveling museum of ``Gone With The Wind'' memorobilia,
he said.
