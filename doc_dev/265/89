<LEADPARA>  FOR those who don't have the time or the money or the stomach to read
"Scarlett," Alexandra Ripley's $24.95 823-page bodice-ripping sequel to "Gone
With the Wind," we offer another chapter of our own wallet-ripping roman a
clef of private and public relations among the high and the mighty, "Gone With
the Ring.";   Morning light peeped through the Mario Pinata watered satin
draperies as Marla woke after a restless night of tossing and turning her
lissome body on her fashionably wrinkled hand-embroidered linen Portsalut
sheets. Her trademark blond mane, usually so meticulously styled by Hugo of
Baltimore, was a hopeless tangle; her lovely eyes were puffy from hours of
weeping.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     How could she face the world after being so cruelly and publicly used and
abandoned? He had stolen the best months of her life and made a mockery of her
love. Had it all been a bad dream? She lifted her left hand to the light. The
sun caught the facets on the fabulous Winston Burdett ("Jewelers to the Rich")
17-karat diamond ring he had given her as a token of his eternal devotion. The
legendary gem, once the personal property of Ann-Margret and before that the
Grand Duchess Manilow of Minsk, cast a rainbow about the room.;   No. It
wasn't a dream. She recalled their "scene" of the night before, and the vow
she'd made, "I'll get him back. Tomorrow is another day.";   Now tomorrow was
here. How would she get him back? Did she care if she got him back, if she
could keep the ring? "With God as my judge," she said aloud, "I'll never give
back this ring!";   But had the ring been his to give her? There had been
rumors he had "borrowed" the ring from Winston Burdett for publicity purposes,
and more rumors that the ring belonged not to her, not to him, not even to
Winston Burdett, but to the Beneficial Finance Co.;   There was a discreet
knock at the boudoir door, then the genteel voice of her faithful chaperon
Mrs. Slump saying, "You have visitors, dear. Kathy Lee and Baby Cody.";  
Before Marla could leap from bed and don her gossamer silk handloomed Futomaki
kimono, Kathy Lee burst into the room singing "Put On A Happy Face." She
looked perky-as-could-be in one of her more subdued daytime ensembles, a
spangled lime-green Bruce of Houston cowgirl-style cat-suit with
color-coordinated guano boots.;   Baby Cody, adorable as ever, toddled across
the room to the Louis XVII escheatage and began chewing on the hand-cut
crystal Liberace Museum bonbonniere, a souvenir of a magic weekend they'd
spent at the fights in Las Vegas, before he had humiliated her.;   "Cheer up,
sweetie," said Kathy Lee in her uplifting way. "Look what Regis sent you."
Kathy Lee plopped the cap on Marla's lovely if uncombed head, squeezed the
visor and soon the room was filled with the inspiring strains of "The Notre
Dame Fight Song.";   What a good friend Kathy Lee was. Marla could always
count on her for advice. What was it she had said last night as Marla sobbed
into the phone? "Look for the silver lining." That was it. "It's always
darkest before the dawn." Such words of wisdom, so like Kathy Lee. Then she
had asked Marla to join her in singing "Amazing Grace.";   "Can I try it on?"
Kathy Lee asked. Marla slipped the fabulous jewel from her finger and handed
it to her friend, who held it up to the light. "Ooh Cody, look," said Kathy
Lee.;   "Maybe he shouldn't . . ." said Marla.;   But it was too late. Baby
Cody was stuffing the ring into his mouth. There was a loud cracking sound.
"Oh my God, his teeth!" cried Kathy Lee. "Oh my God, the ring!" cried Marla.
