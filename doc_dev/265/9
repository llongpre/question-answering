<LEADPARA>  BY THE fluid, practiced way the story flows forth in his refined Southern
drawl, you immediately know it's one of Franklin Garrett's favorite -- and
most often told -- anecdotes.;   "I remember so well," Garrett says, "Margaret
Mitchell telling me a few months before 'Gone With the Wind' came out in 1936
that she would be happy if it sold a thousand copies."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Garrett, 84, Atlanta's official historian and a pallbearer at Mitchell's
funeral in 1949, pauses for dramatic effect, then adds: "I'd say it did a
little better than that.";   Did it ever.;   "Gone With the Wind" became one
of the biggest success stories in publishing history. Twenty-eight million
copies have been sold; the book continues to fly off the shelves at a clip of
250,000 a year. It won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for fiction and, in 1939,
spawned an epic movie that won a then-record 10 Academy Awards.;   Today, a
much-anticipated offspring appears in bookstores. In "Scarlett: The Sequel to
Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind," Southern historical novelist
Alexandra Ripley has attempted to finish what Mitchell started -- the story of
Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, figures that loom as large as any in popular
fiction.;   It seems a fait accompli that the sequel will be a can't-miss
commercial smash. "Gone With the Wind" remains one of the most beloved novels
ever; a built-in and eager audience awaits "Scarlett" so it can forge beyond
the original conclusion, in which a flawed but irresistible heroine was
deserted by the frankly-my-dear-I-don't-give-a-damning Rhett.;   Yet although
"Scarlett" may become a runaway best seller, its prospects for staking a "Gone
With the Wind"-like claim on the hearts of its readers are far less
encouraging, no matter how faithful an effort Ripley (already a best-selling
author in her own right) turns in.;   Big shoes to fill; On the intimidation
scale, writing this sequel would be only a notch or two below writing one to
the Old Testament. Mitchell's book -- her only novel -- long ago became a
Southern icon, a sprawling, semi-sanitized vision of the Old South and
Reconstruction that came to be shared by people below and above the
Mason-Dixon line.;   What was the magic ingredient that made "Gone With the
Wind" such an enduring work? Why was it able to transcend its regional
parameters (it is, after all, wholly sympathetic to the Confederate cause and
the Southern way of life now "gone with the wind") and become an American
institution?;   Part of the answer lies with the national literary sentiment
regarding the South that had been evolving since the time in which Mitchell's
book was cast.;   The harsh perceptions many Northerners held of the South in
the immediate aftermath of the Civil War had already softened a brief
generation later. That change was reflected in the literature of the day. By
the 1880s, Southern writers such as Joel Chandler Harris were gaining a wide
readership with rose-colored stories about plantation life in the Old South.; 
 In his seminal work, "Road to Reunion," historian Paul H. Buck of Harvard
University noted that as long as slavery had been in force, "no author had
been able to touch on Southern themes without becoming a defender of a system
which seemed to threaten Northern interests.";   Once slavery was abolished,
however, "and Southern writers no longer aspired to Southern independence, the
situation was reversed," Buck wrote. "By 1880 the North had lost its
apprehension. . . . A culture which in its life was anathema to the North,
could in its death be honored.";   Changing values; Bill Barnard, professor of
history at the University of Alabama, says that although the South lost the
Civil War, it "in some ways won the peace for a time.;   "By the 1890s, as
Northerners were struggling with ethnic problems, with the influx of Poles and
Slavs and Italians and the rest, many began to adopt or reassert the same kind
of racial views that Southerners held.";   It was in 1896, for example, that
Plessy vs. Ferguson, the Supreme Court decision that upheld state-imposed
segregation, was handed down; that ruling established the "separate but equal"
doctrine that was the legal basis for segregation in America for a
half-century.;   The "Southern view" also became increasingly common in
cultural circles. A landmark 1915 silent film, D.W. Griffith's "The Birth of a
Nation," appallingly glorified the Civil War-era Ku Klux Klan. By today's
standards, the film is startlingly racist, but few white Americans seemed
troubled by it at the time. (The fledgling National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, however, protested it.);   By the time "Gone
With the Wind" was published during the Great Depression, many white Americans
were ready for a Southern view of the events of the Civil War, with slavery
depicted as benign and the Reconstruction era as dark and corrupt.;  
"Margaret Mitchell both reflected and contributed to this growing 'genial
vision' of the South," Barnard says.;   Yet good timing alone does not a
classic make. "Gone With the Wind" was 1,000-plus pages of powerful
storytelling, slow going at times but, for countless readers, ultimately worth
the effort. Scarlett's unyielding resolve to rise from the ashes of the war
makes for a globally appealing tale with a universal theme.;   "The Japanese,
for example, are absolutely crazy about 'Gone With the Wind,' " Barnard says.
"Part of it lies in the sheer characterization of Scarlett. Here is an
absolutely determined woman; that scene where she holds up the turnip and vows
that she'll never go hungry again is a testament to human endurance and
persistence that Southerners, Japanese or any culture that has gone through
that type of devastation could appreciate.";   Fifty-five years after
publication, "Gone With the Wind" remains an integral part of the
coming-of-age process for many young readers. "Even upon subsequent readings,
I find it to be an emotional experience," Garrett says.;   Is a sequel in
order?;   Some fans and critics have decried the notion of another "Gone With
the Wind" and have charged the Mitchell estate, which commissioned "Scarlett,"
with callously fleecing the book's legacy before the copyright expires in
2011.;   Garrett, who probably knew Mitchell as well as anyone still alive,
doesn't see it that way. He believes Mitchell never wrote a sequel because
"she was so overwhelmed with the success of 'Gone With the Wind' that I think
she hardly would have had time.";   "My reaction was maybe we need a sequel.
The way it ended left you wondering if Rhett ever came back or how Scarlett
ever made out when she got older. I intend to read it. And all those people
who say there shouldn't be a sequel and that they won't read it, I'll bet
every one of them reads it anyway."  </TEXT>
