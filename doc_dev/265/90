<LEADPARA>  The greyhounds, for the record, weren't gray. They were brown, black, white
and various shades of tan.;    Which was just fine with the families adopting
them. They came to San Jose's Southside Community Center on a brilliant
Saturday morning looking not for a color but for a friend.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Volunteers with the California Region of Greyhound Pets of America had
driven all night to bring 10 dogs from San Diego to their new Northern
California homes, the largest single delivery of dogs to this area. The
regional organization has matched about 900 retired racing dogs with adoptive
families since 1984. The animals that are not placed by the organization or
track owners face being put to death.;    "I'm a sap for animals and I'm a big
sap for ones that are in trouble," said Linda Lindemeyer of Campbell, who had
come with her family to pick up Hornet, quickly renamed Scarlett, as in
Scarlett O'Hara.;    "We figure if she ever gets out, she's gone with the
wind," Lindemeyer joked.;    Before the dogs arrived, prospective owners paced
the community center parking lot like expectant parents, carrying leashes
instead of teddy bears. Most had photos of their new pet, and waited anxiously
to spot them as the van and truck from San Diego pulled up.;    Justin
Huffaker, a volunteer with Greyhound Pets of America, said his group received
more than 100 calls from the San Jose area after an article on the national
organization ran in the Mercury News in February. From those inquiries, the
families were narrowed down to the 10 who received their dogs Saturday.;   
The adoption process, which includes a $60 fee, is lengthy and includes an
at-home visit with the family. Dogs are screened to meet each family's needs
and characteristics, and new owners must agree to have the dogs spayed or
neutered.;    Most of the dogs are 2 to 5 years old and have been retired
because of injury, lack of success in racing or because their ability has
trailed off, Huffaker said.;    The organization skirts questions about the
numbers of dogs that are put to death, because much of its work depends on the
goodwill of racing officials. According to published reports, between 15,000
and 50,000 animals are put to death each year. But according to group members,
race track owners are increasingly cooperative with the organization.;    Even
with the lengthy adoption process, Saturday's session included an hourlong
discussion of dog care and special traits of greyhounds.;    Believed to be
the oldest breed of dog, the greyhound was a companion to ancient Egyptians
who slept with the animals for warmth. Because they are carefully bred for
racing, the animals have few congenital problems and make docile, loving pets,
according to Greyhound Pets of America.;    After reading about the
organization, Debbie Bounds of Vacaville decided to adopt Lemondrop, soon to
be named Gracie, a creamy white dog with butterscotch markings whose elegant
sleekness and serene disposition bring to mind a 1940s movie star. Within an
hour of meeting, the two seemed to have formed a mutual admiration society.;  
 "She's so polite. She's so gentle," said Bounds as Lemondrop watched her with
clear, brown eyes. ". . . That's what I was looking for, a companion.";     IF
