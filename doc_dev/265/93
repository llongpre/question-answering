   When cable TV pioneer and movie buff Ted Turner
bought the MGM movie library three years ago, he got ``The Wizard
of Oz'' _ but he can't show it on his own stations until 1999.
   Under an agreement hammered out at the time of the MGM purchase,
the Turner Broadcast System gave up television rights to ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' but obtained the rights to another classic, ``Gone
With the Wind,'' Turner's favorite film.
   Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler thus left CBS for TBS, while
Dorothy and Toto set up camp with CBS, which first showed ``The
Wizard of Oz'' to television viewers on the night of Nov. 3, 1956.
   ``What happened was, Ted traded,'' said Karen Nicol of TBS. ``We
had the TV rights to `The Wizard of Oz,'' but Ted really wanted
`Gone With the Wind.'''
   Even though Turner can't show `Oz' on its TBS SuperStation or on
TNT _ Turner Network Television, its feature entertainment channel
_ that hasn't stopped Turner and his companies from marking the
film's 50th anniversary.
   Under license from TBS, MGM-UA Home Video will release its
``Golden 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition'' videocassette of
``Oz,'' complete with a ``commemorative videotape package.''
   Fancy packaging aside, the new version is being touted as a
videophile's delight _ fully restored, and with two added
sequences: a dance reprise of ``If I Only Had a Brain,'' performed
by Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and another musical number, ``The
Jitterbug.'' Both were cut from the film during editing.
   Missing from the home video version are the familiar
black-and-white Kansas sequences, before Dorothy crashes into Oz;
that's because they aren't really supposed to be black and white.
The film's first moments were originally filmed in sepia and white,
for a softer transition to the Technicolor splendor of Oz. Later
prints opted for the simpler black-and-white technique.
   ``It's a beautifully restored print, with the original
Technicolor at its best,'' said TBS' Frank Miller. ``And with the
Kansas sequences, in the original sepia tone ... it's really
beautiful.''
   It's not as if the old videocassette did badly; released in
1980, it's sold 600,000 copies in the United States, according to
TBS.
   In addition to the new videocassette, TBS also is releasing the
restored film for special screenings in theaters across the
country, Miller said.
   A new release of the score is coming out on compact disc,
including a recording Buddy Ebsen made during his nine days as the
Tin Woodman. According to ``Oz'' film chronicler Aljean Harmetz,
Ebsen suffered a debilitating allergic reaction to the aluminum
dust the costumers dumped all over him and was hospitalized,
leading to his replacement with Jack Haley.
   And if seeing the movie and hearing the score aren't enough,
``Oz'' fans, under a ``worldwide licensing program'' of Turner Home
Entertainment, can buy an oz-tentatious array of stuff:
   There's Oz clothing for the whole family, including maternity
wear. Ties. Jewelry. Costumes of the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion
and other characters. Greeting cards. Postcards. Buttons. Key
chains. Calendars. ``Bendable toys.'' Giftwrap. Lunch boxes. Beach
towels.
   All are for sale in ``The Turner Store,'' a souvenir stand in
the lobby of Turner's CNN Center building in Atlanta.
   Also available: ``dental reminder cards,'' to send cowardly
patients off to see the dentist _ which for some, can be as big an
adventure as going off to see the Wizard.
