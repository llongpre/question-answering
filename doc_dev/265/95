   Warner Books agreed to pay almost $5 million for the right to publish the sequel to "Gone With the Wind," the all-time best-selling American novel. 

   After a long and spirited auction, Warner, a unit of Warner Communications Inc., New York, outbid more than a half-dozen other publishing companies for the right to publish the sequel, which will be written by Alexandra Ripley. 
Because Warner had the "floor" for the sale, it had the right to top the final auction bid. 

   "Gone With the Wind," written by Margaret Mitchell, was first published in 1936. 
The book has since sold more than 25 million copies. 
The author herself refused to write a sequel. 
But with the novel's copyright due to expire in 2011, the executors of her estate decided to find an author they approved of to write it. 

   The auction was conducted by the William Morris agency. 
The publishing companies were bidding on the basis of only 39 pages that Ms. Ripley has already written. 
The book is due for publication in 1990.
