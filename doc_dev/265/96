   Four young men caught raiding crab traps
will have to parade around Palatka for four consecutive Saturdays
wearing placards proclaiming their crime.
   ``It is a felony, punishable by five years in prison and-or a
$5,000 fine to molest crab pots,'' the signs say. ``I know because I
molested one.''
   Stephen Michael Kittredge, a 23-year-old insurance salesman from
Jacsonville, was one of four men caught raiding traps in the St.
Johns River.
   Too much beer and too little common sense were to blame, he said.
   ``It was Memorial Day weekend. We were just a bunch of guys
having a good old time,'' he said. ``We were probably a little bit
drunk. We were wrong, we readily admit we were very wrong.''
   Kittredge, John Shiver Snelling, 24; Gregory Coleman Dyer, 24;
and David Todd Harris, 23; avoided criminal prosecution by agreeing
to prosecutors' demands that they march with the placards.
   The signs must be on poster board-size placards and readable from
100 feet.
   But the fisherman who lost about 25 crabs said the punishment is
not enough for his loss.
   ``I'm still so ... mad I could slap one of them and not flinch,''
said Robert Scholl, who has been crabbing for 17 years.
   Each of the four men also must pay Scholl five times the cost of
the damage to the traps and the lost crabs. The amount has not been
determined.
   The punishment _ reminiscent of the scarlet ``A'' adulterer
Hester Prynne had to wear in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel ``The
Scarlet Letter'' _ was concocted by State Attorney John Tanner. It
was accepted by the men in a deferred prosecution agreement that
does not need the victim's approval.
