   Milan's Corriere Della Sera (moderate):
   ``When Scarlet O'Hara, heroine of the romantic South of `Gone
With The Wind,' lived here in Atlanta, on Peachtree Street, she
would say in front of every problem `I will think about it
tomorrow.' Gov. Mike Dukakis, who last night accepted the
Democratic nomination for the White House at the convention palace
just half a mile from the house of Scarlet, instead faces his
problems mumbling ``I will think about it now.'' His mother says
with a smile that the first words spoken by Dukakis were in Greek
``monos mou,'' or ``let me do it by myself,'' and as a student,
activist, professor, governor and presidential candidate Dukakis
did it all by himself, without clamor, without second thoughts,
without snobbery.''

   Rome's La Repubblica (liberal):
   ``The convention in Atlanta has also confirmed a truth that we
Europeans have known for some time: the barrenness today of the
left, of any left, in its normal function of political planning.
Dukakis takes with him from the convention, on the 100 days to Nov.
8, no idea of society, no program. There is only the promise of a
good administration, and of greater compassion for the poorer
America from a candidate whose merits in front of history are two:
   ``Firstly to have put in order the accounts of his state,
Massachusetts, and secondly of being a little less disagreeable, of
having a character that is little less flaccid, than George Bush.''

   President Alan Garcia spoke in support Thursday of the
Democratic Party platform regarding Latin America and said he
expects ``great dialogue'' between North and South America to
follow the U.S. presidential election.
   ``There are new winds blowing in the United States. I have read
the Democratic platform. It calls for non-confrontation with Latin
America and peaceful and harmonious relations,'' Garcia, a Social
Democrat, told 30 officials from across the continent meeting in
Lima to discuss Latin American cooperation.
   Garcia indicated a Democratic program would be positive for the
region.
   ``The Democratic platform speaks of economic cooperation and
mentions the foreign debt. Whatever the election result, we will
have a new situation in a few months. I think 1989 could be a year
of great dialogue,'' said Garcia, who has frequently charged that
the policies of the United States and other industrialized
countries toward Latin America are imperialistic.

   Government-run Radio South Africa said in an editorial broadcast
today:
   ``According to reports, leaders of America's Democratic Party
are quietly distancing Mr. Michael Dukakis from the radical foreign
policy stands forced on him at the party convention by Mr. Jesse
Jackson. The shift, to make the presidential candidate more
acceptable to the voters, includes South Africa. In particular, the
reference to South Africa as an `terrorist state' has been
conspicuously absent from speeches.
   ``If a substantive change is in fact taking place it will be
welcomed not only in South Africa but by many Western leaders for
whom terrorism is much too serious a threat to civilized society to
be exploited for personal political gain. Most are well aware that
with respect to terrorism South Africa, far from being a sponsor,
has been a target of a sustained campaign. It has conducted
cross-border raids against the ANC _ but it has done so _ as other
countries have -- under the legal doctrines of hot pursuit and
pre-emptive strikes.''

   The Asahi Shimbun (liberal) commented in its editorial today on
the appointment of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Dukakis' running
mate.
   ``In order to unify the party which consists of a diversity of
opinions, he (Dukakis) has to become the middle core of the party
first. Then, he needs to absorb conservative voices, which Bensten
represents, and liberal groups which support Jesse Jackson ...
   ``It must be the result of careful deliberation, but the
differences between the two (Dukakis and Bensten) still stand out.
They not only differ in their lifestyles but also political
standpoint...
   ``Dukakis opposes such critical issues as aid to the Contras,
tax reduction, the MX missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative,
the death penalty, and balancing the budget, while Bensten is in
favor of all of them ...
   ``What was remarkable in the convention was the outstanding
performance of Jesse Jackson. He appears to have decided to
cooperate with Dukakis to unify the party ahead of the November
election, but the fact that the rise of the Rainbow Coalition,
which represents interests of blacks, Hispanics, minority groups
and the low-income class, indicates the emergence of a new flow in
the American society.''
