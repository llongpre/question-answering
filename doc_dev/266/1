   Nuclear accidents caused mainly by careless
handling of radioactive materials killed 20 people and injured
1,200 in China from 1980 to 1985, an official report said Saturday.
   Luo Guozhen of the State Environmental Protection Bureau said
China needs stricter measures for handling nuclear waste and other
radioactive materials, the official China Daily reported.
   Luo did not say how many accidents occurred from 1980 to 1985,
and he did not give details of those that did occur, according to
the report.
   Ignorance about the dangers of nuclear materials, and managers
who ignored regulations on handling radioactive waste, caused
radiation leaks in recent years, the newspaper said.
   It was China's first report on deaths caused by radioactivity.
   China previously has disclosed that nuclear accidents had
occurred, but it did not acknowledge they had caused severe
radiation sickness or deaths.
   There are no nuclear power plants in operation in China,
although two are under construction. Most of China's nuclear waste
so far has been generated by the military, but growing amounts are
being produced in laboratories, hospitals and non-military
industries.
   Some of the accidents resulted from workers stealing containers
used to hold radioactive materials.
   In December, a carpenter at an electric equipment plant in
coastal Jiangsu province stole a lead container used to hold cobalt
60, the report said.
   No deaths or injuries have been reported in that case, it said.
   In February, the newspaper reported some uranium had been lost
from a factory, exposing 15 people to radiation.
   In 1986, an article by Zhou Zhumou of the Ministry of Nuclear
Industry's Bureau of Safety, Protection and Health said an
unspecified number of people were exposed to radiation when China's
nuclear industry started up in the mid-1950s.
   During the tumultuous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when
scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns, a
serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern
China, Zhou said.
   About 10 people were exposed to radiation in that accident and
another man got uranium poisoning in 1973, but there were no cases
of acute radiation sickness, he said.
   The Soviet Union has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident.
   In the United States, One man died in an accident in 1986 at the
Kerr-McGee atomic plant in Oklahama, and three people were killed
by radiation at an experimental reactor in Idaho in 1961.
   Saturday's report says China plans to build nuclear waste
storage facilities to handle the growing volume of radioactive
waste produced by about 1,000 industries and research labs.
   The scheduled start-up of the Qinshan nuclear power plant in
coastal Zhejiang province next December and of the Daya Bay plant
in southeast Guangdong province in October 1992 will mean a
substantial increase in China's production of nuclear waste.
   In the past, China stored radioactive waste in concrete basement
facilities designed to protect the materials for only 10 years,
according to Pan Ziqiang of the China National Nuclear Industry
Corp.
   Luo said waste storage facilities now have been built in 12
provinces and are planned for eight others. He did not describe the
facilities.
