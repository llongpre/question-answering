   Kiev residents who get a mysterious ache or pain
are apt to grasp for the easy explanation _ radiation from
Chernobyl.
   Such is one of the lingering scars of the world's worst nuclear
accident: a fear of what long-term health problems will result from
the explosion and fire two years ago at the Chernobyl nuclear
plant, 80 miles north of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
   A Kiev resident, speaking during a Moscow visit on condition of
anonymity, said some people blame everything from headaches to
toothaches on radiation from Chernobyl. This is despite the
government's repeated assurances that radiation levels in the
region are normal and safe.
   Doctors in accident-affected regions are spending most of their
time ``combating radiophobia,'' the government newspaper Izvestia
reported in February.
   A Soviet pediatrician said last August that more than 2,000
healthy children were born to mothers who lived around Chernobyl
during the April 26, 1986 disaster, which killed 31 people and
spewed a cloud of radioactivity worldwide.
   But an American doctor who treated some Chernobyl victims,
Robert Gale, wrote April 1 in Pravda that the accident's long-term
effects cannot be predicted. He guessed that problems could include
birth defects, genetic deviations and an additional 6,000 cancer
victims in the next 50 to 70 years.
   Although a Pravda report on Sunday criticized nepotism,
drunkenness and sloppy repairs at the plant, other reports marking
the disaster's second anniversary portray life returning to normal.
   They say Chernobyl's reactors are generating electricity again
and people are living nearby in once dangerously radioactive areas.
   But the fear of nuclear power remains.
   Taking advantage of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign for ``glasnost,'' or more openness on some issues, nuclear
power opponents have been speaking out and in some cases halting
construction of new nuclear plants.
   ``Who will say that each of these atomic power stations, built
or planned, does not conceal another potential Chernobyl?''
Ukrainian writer Oles Honchar asked at a conference last October.
   The government's answer: ``One can say now with confidence that
even a recurrence of the errors which were made in Chernobyl would
not lead to such a disaster,'' Nuclear Power Minister Nikolai
Lukonin told the Soviet news agency Tass last week.
   Officials say the public's fears are unjustified. Plans call for
doubling by 1990 the amount of electricity generated by nuclear
plants from the 1985 level of 28 million kilowatts.
   Part of the increased production is from the Chernobyl plant
itself.
   But the resumed production reportedly is not without its costs.
   V. Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town
for plant workers 35 miles from Chernobyl, said last December that
sloppy work, poor discipline and safety violations at the plant
contributed to 36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them
fatal.
   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl clean-up
commission, denied at a news conference last week that any major
accident had occurred at the plant since the 1986 explosion.
   Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the
accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10
years in a labor camp. The government blamed the accident on human
error in shutting down safety systems to conduct unauthorized
experiments.
   In January, the ruling Politburo put the accident's cost at
$13.8 billion.
   Another price paid was in people's shaken faith in the
government's ability to harness nuclear energy safely. The
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said nuclear plants once lent
prestige to a city, ``but that was before Chernobyl.''
   Popular opposition has prevented building two nuclear plants
near the Ukrainian city of Odessa and the Byelorussian capital of
Minsk.
   Construction of a nuclear plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar
was halted because residents complained it was in an
earthquake-prone area and too close to a nature preserve.
   Public complaints appear to have been at least partly behind the
government's May 1987 decision to stop building two additional
reactors at Chernobyl.
   Thirty Ukrainian scientists, writing Jan. 21 in the newspaper
Literaturnaya Ukraina, criticized on ecological grounds the
government's plans to add reactors to three other plants. They
accused the government of ignoring the ``bitter lessons of
Chernobyl.''
