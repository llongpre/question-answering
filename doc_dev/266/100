<HEAD>No Radiation Leak During Soviet Nuclear Plant Fire, Tass Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   A nuclear power plant caught fire in Lithuania on
Monday, but automatic safety systems extinguished the flames before
radiation could be released, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said no one was injured by the blaze which began at 12:50
a.m. in a control cable of the second reactor of the Ignalina power
plant in Lithuania, a Soviet republic on the Baltic Sea.
   The chief dispatcher of the Soviet Atomic Power Ministry, Erik
Pozdyshev, told Tass the reactor's safety systems automatically
kicked in and that the fire had already been put out by the time
firefighters arrived.
   He said no radiation escaped the plant, and there were no
injuries among the public or plant employees. The reactor, one of
two at the plant, was shut down after the accident, Tass said.
   The news agency's prompt reporting of the fire reflected the new
official policy under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive
for more openness, especially about important events such as
accidents.
   ``Considering the heightened public interest in nuclear reactor
operations, which is quite understandable after the Chernobyl
accident, we decided to inform the public about what has happened
at the Ignalina station at once,'' Pozdyshev said.
   The Soviet Union waited days before informing the world of the
April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.
   The first report on the accident came from Swedish officials
after high levels of radiation were discovered in Sweden.
   The world's worst nuclear power accident killed 31 people and
sent out a cloud of radiation that stretched worldwide. It led to a
major re-evaluation of the safety of nuclear power in the Soviet
Union and in many other countries.
   The government newspaper Izvestia reported on Thursday that
Lithuania's Cabinet had ordered construction stopped on a third
reactor at Ignalina.
   The newspaper said numerous safety violations were committed
during construction of the plant's first reactor, and were repeated
on the third unit.
   Tass said a commission has been formed to investigate today's
accident.
