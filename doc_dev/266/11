<F P=106> [Report by science editor Roger Highfield: ``Sellafield: </F>
Who Is Hit If the Worst Happens?''] 
  [Text] It hasn't happened yet. But should an accident 
occur at Sellafield, the nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, 
the path of a radioactive cloud across Britain can be plotted 
instantly. 
  The hypothetical ``footprint'' of pollution caused by a leak 
and borne on prevailing winds can now be predicted using a 
computer model. And a couple of days can make all the 
difference between radioactive fallout spreading over 
Scandinavia, or falling in Britain's back yard. 
  A small-scale version can also reveal how the location and 
height of a smokestack at a chemical plant affects local 
pollution. ``We could predict five days ahead when there will 
be a problem with a factory,'' said Robert Chadwick, 
environmental product manager at the Meteorological [Met] 
Office, which has developed the model. 
  The Met Office hopes to use the model, which can incorporate 
weather forecasts, as a tool to predict air quality, such as the 
risk of ozone or nitrogen dioxide pollution under certain 
weather conditions. 
  When the Met Office unveils its new generation of computer 
models next month, Whitehall, local councils, pressure groups 
and environmentalists are expected to show interest in the 
predictions, which can be produced for as little as 250 pounds. 
  The Government will rely on the computer model to highlight 
areas at risk from acid rain across the globe and to predict the 
fallout in the event of a catastrophic nuclear accident. 
  The Met Office's Nuclear Accident Response Model has shown, 
for instance, that the radioactive plume released by a nuclear 
accident is diluted more during a hot day in summer than a cold 
night in winter. The distance the plume of radioactivity 
travels can depend on the presence of a faster, mobile, 
nonturbulent layer of air above the explosion. At night, the 
cool still air can make this layer a few metres thick, while it 
could be as much as a mile on a summer afternoon, enabling the 
plume to travel a long way. 
  The model was developed in the wake of the world's worst 
nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in 1986, when it became clear 
that there was a need for a way to assess the risks to the 
public created by an airborne plume of radioactivity. A 
smattering of dots moving across a computer screen can aid 
crisis management by showing how radioactivity spreads, or the 
effect of smoke sent up by a major fire or volcano. 
  ``Just select your accident and we can forecast the 
effects,'' said Roy Maryon, one of its developers. 
  In the case of Chernobyl, it took a few days before the 
world 
was aware of the accident. Now ``hindcasts'' based on weather 
patterns can track the pollution over five days from the moment 
of release . 
  The computer was put through its paces by Noel Nelson and 
Karl Kitchen, who helped to develop the model. They simulated a 
nuclear accident at Sellafield -- site of the western world's 
worst leak, in 1957, when it was known as Windscale. 
  They chose two different days last month to stage a 
hypothetical nuclear accident, and after the computer had 
processed the relevant weather data it plotted the gradual 
spread of radioactive particles across a map. Had the accident 
occurred on January 15, within three days north-easterly winds 
would have wafted the pollution by turns across southern 
Ireland, Wales, the West Midlands, the south coast as far east 
as Brighton, then Devon, Cornwall and the coasts of northern 
France. 
  By Jan 18, the winds had turned towards the east. ``We see a 
plume passing across the country to the North Sea,'' Mr. Nelson 
said. Had this been the date when a leak began, only the 
northeast coast of Britain would have received fall-out, while 
Scandinavia would have felt the effects 48 hours later. 
  Other computer plots show how radioactivity would have been 
washed out of the atmosphere by rain, creating distinct areas 
where fall-out would concentrate. Within 36 hours of the Jan 15 
emission, the worst hotspots would have been in northern France, 
with most of Wales and the West Midlands almost as badly hit. 
  Mr. Chadwick said he could have done with such a warning in 
1986, when he was rained on as Chernobyl's plume passed overhead. 
  The Met Office's computer model contains details of nuclear 
plants across the planet. It is also linked to a national 
radiation monitoring network, called Rimnet, so that its 
predictions can be checked and refined. A major European 
experiment, Etex, will be conducted this year to see how well 20 
such computer models predict the movement of an inert tracer gas 
released from Brittany. 
  The model is already part of the Department of the 
Environment's emergency plan for nuclear accidents.
