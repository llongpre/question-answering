   The Soviet Union admitted for the first time Friday
that a tank of radioactive waste exploded at a nuclear weapons plant
nearly 32 years ago, showering particles over nearly 400 square
miles and forcing 10,000 people to evacuate.
   Before the Chernobyl power plant explosion on April 26, 1986,
Western specialists called the disaster in the southern Ural
Mountains the world's worst nuclear accident. A secret CIA file made
public in 1977 quoted Soviet sources as saying hundreds of people
were killed.
   The Western accounts said the explosion created a vast
radioactive wasteland one-third the land area of Rhode Island, or
about 400 square miles.
   Thirty rural villages vanished from Soviet maps, fishing was
banned in lakes, dams were built to contain radioactive waterways
and rivers were diverted with canals, according to the Western
accounts.
   But the official news agency Tass said Friday no casualities had
resulted. It quoted Boris Nikipelov, first deputy minister for
medium machine-building, as telling a news conference a ``chemical
explosion'' occurred in September 1957 near Kasli, about 870 miles
east of Moscow.
   A tank of radioactive waste exploded at a military plant where
atomic weapons were to be built, ``forming a radioactive trail 105
kilometers (65 miles) long and 8 to 9 kilometers (roughly five to 5{
miles) wide,'' said Nikipelov, whose ministry administers
military-related nuclear programs.
   Tass said 2 million curies of radioactive elements were released,
and ``more than 10,000 people were urgently evacuated from the
contaminated zone.'' In comparison, Tass noted that 50 million
curies of radiation were released in the Chernobyl explosion and
fire in which 31 people were killed.
   The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island power plant in
Pennsylvania released 14 curies, a measure of the amount of
radioactivty contained in a material.
   U.S. analysts have calculated that the Urals accident spewed out
more radiation than that produced by the U.S. atomic bombing of
Japan.
   The effects of the accident lasted for decades, Tass indicated.
It said economic activity resumed in the area only by 1978, and even
then only in 80 percent of the contaminated zone. The remaining
territory was turned into a reserve. Radiation returned to safe
levels in the area only by 1974, and lakes and other waterways
remain contaminated, Tass reported.
   Tass did not say when or where Nikipelov gave the news
conference, nor did it say which radioactive particles were released
or whether the atomic weapons plant is still operating.
   Some Western reports have said the accident happened at the
Soviet Union's first nuclear production facility, in Kyshtym, about
20 miles south of Kasli. The complex or a replacement is believed to
be still producing plutonium.
   Tass said the accident was kept secret so long in the Soviet
Union because it occurred at a military plant.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness,
has brought to light other disasters long hushed up. In April, a
Soviet magazine reported for the first time that an ICBM exploded in
1960, killing the chief of Soviet rocket forces and incinerating
many other people.
   Tass said disclosure about the 1957 accident ``poured oil onto
the fire'' of a debate about building an atomic power plant in the
southern Urals. Nikipelov defended the plant's construction,
claiming it would help purify water contaminated by radiation by
evaporating it.
   Since Chernobyl, Soviet public opinion has turned against
harnessing the atom for electricity. Several nuclear power projects
were canceled because of protests.
   The Urals accident was first disclosed in 1972, when Zhores
Medvedev, a Soviet biochmist now living in Britain, wrote that
hundreds of people probably died of radioactive poisoning after
nuclear wastes near the first Soviet atomic power plants exploded.
   Lev Tumerman, a physicist who emigrated to Israel, said in a 1976
interview that he visited the area in the early 1960s and found it
was ``empty land,'' almost like a lunar view.
   CIA documents say another nuclear accident, an explosion,
occurred at Kyshtym in 1960 or 1961.
