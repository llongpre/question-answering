<HEAD>Magazine Says Major Accident At Nuclear Plant Narrowly Averted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>

   East Germany averted a major
nuclear power accident in 1976 that could have been as devasting as
the one at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, a West German magazine
said Sunday.
   East German officials have not disclosed the potential
seriousness of the incident, Der Spiegel said.
   The Hamburg-based magazine said the incident took place in 1976
at the Soviet-designed nuclear power plant called Lubmin, near the
town of Greifswald in northern East Germany.
   Quoting a former engineer from the plant, Spiegel said careless
manipulation of an electrical grounding system by one of the
plant's electricians resulted in a major fire that destroyed most
of the cable network.
   The fire disabled six cooling pumps for the Block I reactor at
the plant, and five of six backup pumps were also inactivated,
Spiegel said.
   ``It was only through luck'' that one of the backup pumps
functioned, Spiegel said, explaining that the backup pump had been
accidentally hooked up to the electrical system of Block II, which
was functioning.
   If the one backup pump had not functioned, a meltdown as
devastating as the 1986 Chernobyl accident could have occurred and
would have spread radioactive fallout over much of northern
Germany, Sweden and Denmark, the magazine said.
   Spiegel, quoting the engineer, said that the East German army
was called in to clean up the plant, which was repaired and put
back into operation four months later. It did not identify the
engineer.
   The report, which is to appear in the weekly magazine's Monday
edition, was provided in advance to other news media.
   The April 26, 1986, explosion at the No. 4 reactor of the
four-unit Chernobyl nuclear power plant was the world's worst
atomic accident. Two workers died immediately of burns they
suffered in the explosion, 28 died shortly after the accident from
radiation exposure, and one died of a heart attack while fighting
the fire.
   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of
northern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from
several countries.
