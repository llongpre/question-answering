   A claim that fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear
accident may have caused deaths in the United States is highly
unlikely and based on an erroneous statistical analysis, scientists
say.
   A researcher, Jay Gould, said he found an unexplained jump in
the nation's deaths in the months following the Chernobyl accident.
   However, the amount of radiation that reached the United States
is so small that the notion is ``not credible,'' Harvard radiation
expert Edward Webster said Tuesday.
   Webster, who serves on a United Nations committee studying
health effects of Chernobyl, called the hypothesis ``a mechanism
which most knowledgeable radiobiologists would throw out because of
the very low doses involved.''
   A federal health statistics official says no mysterious increase
in deaths occurred.
   Gould said he will present his work Thursday at a meeting on
radiation and the immune system in West Germany.
   Gould, a fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies in
Washington, says federal statistics show an unexplained jump of
maybe 20,000 to 40,000 deaths in the nation for May through August
of 1986, following the Soviet accident in April.
   Radioactive fallout from Chernobyl is ``the only explanation
we've been able to develop,'' Gould said in a recent interview.
   The hypothesis, which he stressed was not proven, is that
fallout reaching the United States encouraged formation of ``free
radicals,'' chemically reactive molecules that can damage cells.
These molecules, the hypothesis continues, may have weakened the
immune systems of some people enough to make them vulnerable to
fatal diseases.
   Gould said slightly more than 33 percent of all 1986 deaths
occurred in May through August, up from the average of about 32
percent for the three prior years and the highest percentage since
1900.
   Increases appeared among people older than 65 and those who
suffered from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, he said.
   The study also looked at peak concentrations of iodine-131, a
radioactive component of fallout, reported in milk during the
summer of 1986. Gould said that among the nation's nine census
regions, higher concentrations were associated with greater
increases in mortality for the summer of 1986 compared to the
previous summer.
   The study's data on deaths came from the National Center for
Health Statistics. But Harry Rosenberg, chief of the center's
mortality statistics branch, said Tuesday his analysis found no
inexplicable jump in deaths.
   ``We didn't see anything that departs from the historic
pattern,'' he said.
   ``His numbers are not consistent with the numbers that are
adjusted to represent the United States as a whole.''
   Rosenberg also said 1986 had the lowest death rate ever recorded
for the nation, when the population's changing age composition is
taken into account.
   Neal Nelson, a radiation biologist for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, said he was skeptical of the Chernobyl
hypothesis after starting to study information Gould sent him.
   The maximum dose of Chernobyl radiation in the United States was
only about 1 percent of the normal background exposure, he said.
   People eat radioactive material constantly, from natural and
man-made sources, so ``there is nothing unique'' about swallowing
the tiny amounts of radioactive iodine from Chernobyl fallout, he
said.
