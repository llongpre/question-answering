   Valery A. Legasov, a physical chemist who led the
commission the investigated the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, has
died at the age of 51, the official Soviet news agency Tass
announced.
   Neither Tass nor the evening television news broadcast Vremya on
Friday gave the cause or place of death.
   Tass said Legasov died Wednesday, a day after the second
anniversary of the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the
nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine in which at least 31
people were killed.
   It was not known if Legasov was exposed to dangerous levels of
radiation while investigating the disaster, the world's worst
nuclear power accident.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top Communist Party
officials and scientists signed the obituary carried by Tass.
   Legasov's name had been absent from the dozens of Soviet media
reports on Tuesday's anniversary of the accident at the nuclear
facility 80 miles north of Kiev.
   Legasov's foreign colleagues in nuclear power research had
praised his openness in discussing the causes and effects of the
Chernobyl accident, in contrast to initial Soviet delay in
releasing information about it.
   The accident spread radioactivity worldwide.
   Legasov was first deputy director of the I.V. Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy and a member of the Presidium of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences. The official obituary praised his work
with inert gases and in the use of nuclear reactors to generate
electricity.
   Legasov headed Soviet delegations to meetings on the Chernobyl
disaster of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency.
   In August 1986, he made a five-hour presentation of the Soviet
investigators' report on Chernobyl to the agency. The report blamed
the accident on human error rather than faulty equipment.
   Tass said Legasov made a ``significant contribution in the
working out and realization of immediate measures aimed at
liquidating the consequences of the accident.''
