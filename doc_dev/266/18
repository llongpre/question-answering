<LEADPARA>  THE CHERNOBYL nuclear accident, whose fifth anniversary we mark this week,
dramatically changed attitudes toward nuclear issues -- especially regarding
the potential consequences of a nuclear war.;    A few years ago a Soviet
general told me, "We have looked into hell with Chernobyl." Reactions like
this surely influenced the Soviet Union's willingness to negotiate the
intermediate nuclear forces (INF) reduction treaty and led, ultimately, to
ending the Cold War.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     With this phase of our postwar history ended, the United States is now
tallying the cost. Ironically, Americans may have been the major victims. The
Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency recently
disclosed data on the handling of radioactive substances at nuclear weapons
facilities, especially plutonium production at Hanford, Wash.;    Radioactive
dumping;  The Hanford plant, besides contaminating the air, dumped radioactive
materials into the soil that ultimately reached the water supply, including
the Columbia River, where radioactive fish have been detected. The result was
that almost 250,000 people in Washington, Oregon and Idaho were exposed to
various forms of radioactive iodine, strontium-89, cesium-137 and other
radionuclides.;    Some children living downwind of the plant received
estimated thyroid radiation doses that can cause hypothyroidism and thyroid
cancer. Especially troubling is a recent disclosure that technetium-99 and
iodine-129 were found in soil samples. If you think Styrofoam boxes are a
problem, consider these radioisotopes, which will be around from 2 million to
160 million years.;    Making matters even worse is a recent Department of
Energy report that several radioactive-waste storage tanks at Hanford produce
combustible gases and pose an imminent risk of exploding. Similar problems are
thought to affect other nuclear weapons production, research and testing
facilities throughout the United States.;    The Department of Energy has
recently released data regarding radiation exposure to workers in nuclear
weapons plants and at test sites, affecting about 600,000 people. Other
civilian exposures occurred at or near sites in Washington, Nevada, Idaho,
Colorado, Georgia and Ohio.;    After 45 years, the burden of proof is
shifting from the victims to the government. As many as 2 million Americans
may have been exposed to radiation because of the nuclear arms race.;   
Certainly similar events have occurred in the Soviet Union. Claims of
radiation-related ill-health from Soviets living downwind of the Semipalatinsk
test site in Kazakhstan are remarkably similar to American "down-winders."
Also, the Soviet authorities recently released data confirming an explosion at
the Kyshtym nuclear waste storage site in the Urals in 1957; scores of towns
suddenly disappeared from official maps; a huge area remains contaminated. In
September, an explosion in a nuclear fuels plant at Ust-Kamenogorsk released
beryllium, a toxic non-radioactive chemical, over a large and densely
populated area.;    Solving the problems left by the nuclear arms race will
not be easy. Some estimates suggest that decontamination of nuclear weapons
production facilities and test sites and relocation of radioactive wastes may
require 10 to 20 years, with a cost exceeding $50 billion.;    But I believe
the most serious cost is further loss of credibility of the U.S. government in
nuclear issues. Americans feel betrayed. They feel they were exposed to health
risks in what they now perceive to have been a fruitless exercise. While this
notion is probably incorrect, it is impossible to prove that the nuclear arms
race was necessary to contain the Soviets, or that it ultimately led to the
collapse of communism.;    Public trust;  Can the government regain public
trust with these recent disclosures? Yes, but that is unlikely.;    Still, a
strategy might be to create a Cabinet-level department of nuclear affairs, to
oversee both military and peaceful applications, with close links to the
National Academies of Science and Engineering and other scientific
organizations.;    Such an agency might also help three important but flagging
projects: developing a next generation of advanced nuclear reactors, safe
disposal of high-level radioactive wastes and harnessing nuclear fusion.;   
This could help to restore public confidence in nuclear power, whose role in
global energy production might increase parallel to increasing concern
regarding global warming and use of fossil fuels.;    The Persian Gulf war
shows how dangerous is dependence on Middle East oil. Governmental direction
is badly needed.  </TEXT>
