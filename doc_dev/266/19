   Psychological harm caused by the Chernobyl
nuclear accident is likely to outweigh the other health effects in
the general population, according to the author of a study published
today.
   Marvin Goldman, a professor of radiobiology at the University of
California, Davis, says in his study that the increased risk of
cancer from exposure to airborne radiation from Chernobyl is almost
too small to be measured for the 3 billion people in the northern
hemisphere.
   But the fear caused by the disaster was immense, he said.
   ``This was a major nuclear accident, probably the worst you can
imagine,'' Goldman said in an interview. ``Three billion people were
terrorized.''
   There was just enough general understanding of the disaster to
provoke fear, but not enough to give reassurance, he said.
   Goldman said the fear sprang from ``knowing that the stuff is
radiation, knowing that it's invisible, knowing that the major
consequence is cancer. The Soviets have a word for it _ they call it
radiophobia. They've had a tremendous problem in overcoming this.''
   The increased cancer risk pales in comparison, he said.
   ``The Chernobyl accident was equal to about three years of
background radiation to the population of the northern hemisphere,''
Goldman said.
   The net effect for the 3 billion people in the hemisphere is an
increase in the lifetime chance of dying of cancer of about 0.003
percent, he said.
   For Europeans, who were closer to the accident, he said,
Chernobyl increased cancer risk by about 0.02 percent, an increase
``not worth losing any sleep over.''
   ``We each walk around with about a 20 percent fatal cancer
risk,'' said Goldman. ``For those with a 0.02 percent (risk
increase), it means that instead of a 20 percent risk, it is now
20.02 percent.''
   He said natural radiation will cause about 500,000 people of the
3 billion now living in the northern hemisphere to die of cancer.
The risk estimate added by Chernobyl is calculated to cause an
additional 17,000 deaths, he said.
   ``You couldn't see a number like 17,000 among the 500 million
cancer deaths,'' he said. ``There is no way that such a small
increase could ever be demonstrated epidemiologically.''
   The Chernobyl plant, in the Soviet Union near the city of Kiev,
exploded and burned on April 26, 1986. It spawned a cloud of
radioactive material that swept in a cloud around the globe. The
most immediate effect was near the plant where there were 237 cases
of acute radiation sickness, including 31 deaths.
   Public concern elsewhere was heightened by the problem of whom to
believe: ``which are the real facts and which aren't,'' he said.
   Some governments in Europe overreacted despite the existence of
detailed plans prepared in advance, Goldman said.
   ``As the pressure mounted and press attention grew, all the
numbers and preparations just went out the window. Some governments
took action just to appear to be doing something about it.''
   In many cases, food and crops were destroyed unnecessarily, he
said, and some individual reactions were hysterical.
   Goldman said a German woman called him to ask if she should shoot
her race horse out of fear that the animal would not be able to
breed properly.
   The professor said he reassured her and the horse was spared.
   The study co-authored by Goldman on the Chernobyl accident is
published today in Science, the journal of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science. The other authors were Lynn R.
Anspaugh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,
Calif., and Robert J. Catlin of Electric Power Institute in Palo
Alto, Calif.
