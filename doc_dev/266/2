   China today disclosed for the first time that 20
people died and 1,200 suffered radiation-related illnesses in
nuclear accidents from 1980-85.
   The official China Daily quoted Luo Guozhen of the State
Environmental Protection Bureau as saying China needed stricter
control over the handling of radioactive waste and that the
government plans to build more disposal sites to handle the
material.
   Several accidents involving nuclear waste have been reported in
the past, but there have been no official disclosures of deaths.
   Luo told the paper that ignorance about the dangers of nuclear
materials and managers who ignored regulations on handling
radioactive waste had caused radiation leaks.
   In February, the China Daily reported an accident that occurred
last December, when some uranium was lost from a factory and 15
people were exposed to radiation. One man suffered third-degree
burns, the report said.
   In 1986, an article by Zhou Zhumou at the Ministry of Nuclear
Industry's Bureau of Safety, Protection and Health said there were
cases of exposure to radiation when China's nuclear industry
started up in the mid-1950s.
   It said that during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when
scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns, a
serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern
China.
   Zhou said that about 10 people suffered from overexposure to
radiation in that accident and that another man got uranium
poisoning in an accident in 1973. But he said there had been no
cases of acute radiation sickness.
   The Soviet Union has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident.
   In the United States, one man died in an accident in 1986 at the
Kerr-McGee atomic plant in Oklahoma and three people were killed by
radiation at an experimental reactor in Idaho in 1961.
   The China Daily also reported that China plans to begin
construction of nuclear waste sites in eight provinces to handle
its growing production of radioactive material.
   Nuclear dumps already have been built in 12 provinces, it said.
It quoted Luo as saying the only major regions that will not have
waste storage sites after 1990 would be Hainan island and Tibet.
   He said the facilities are needed to handle waste produced by
about 1,000 industries and research establishments across the
country.
   Most of China's nuclear waste so far has been generated by the
military, but growing amounts are being produced by scientific
labs, hospitals and non-military industries.
   Adding to the waste storage problem is the planned December
start-up of the Qinshan nuclear power plant in Zhejiang and the
1992 scheduled opening of the Daya Bay plant in southeast China's
Guangdong Province.
   Earlier this year, the paper reported that China was making
plans for its first permanent nuclear waste dumps to be built in
the coastal Zhejiang province and in northwest China.
   The report in February quoted Pan Ziqiang, director of the
safety department of the state National Nuclear Industry Corp., as
saying that so far all of China's nuclear wastes have been put in
concrete basement facilities and those sites only protect the
material for about 10 years.
   Today's report did not describe the facilities being built.
