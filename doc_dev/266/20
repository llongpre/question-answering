   The failure of high-tech medicine to save some
Chernobyl radiation victims is a reminder of doctors' limited
ability to cope with nuclear disasters, a U.S. physician says.
   In a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine, U.S. and
Soviet doctors described their attempts to use transplants to
restore victims' radiation-damaged bone marrow. Of 13 men given
marrow transplants, only two survived.
   ``It should be a clear lesson to everybody that no matter how
sophisticated we get, there are going to be serious limitations,''
said Dr. Robert Peter Gale, a University of California, Los
Angeles, physician who led a four-member U.S. transplant team to
the Soviet Union after Chernobyl.
   ``Nobody should think that doctors are going to bail them out of
any misuse of nuclear devices,'' he said.
   The report was written by Gale, Dr. Alexandr Baranov of Clinical
Hospital 6 in Moscow and 15 other physicians who took part in
caring for Chernobyl victims.
   Gale said he considered the publication itself to be ``a major
diplomatic achievement.''
   ``A joint Soviet-American report of a Soviet nuclear accident
being published in an American journal is extraordinary,'' he said
in an interview. ``This could never have happened three years ago.''
   At least 29 people died after an explosion and fire in 1986 at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union released a
cloud of radioactive material.
   Since Chernobyl, blood cell growth hormones have become
available, and Gale has used them to treat nuclear mishaps in
Brazil and El Salvador.
   Experience gained in the combination of growth hormones and
marrow transplants ``gives us a very sensible strategy for treating
victims of nuclear accidents,'' Gale said.
   High doses of radiation destroy tissue in the bone marrow that
makes new blood cells. This leaves victims at high risk of
infection and other medical problems.
   Gale said that after the Chernobyl accident, doctors treated 499
people, and 202 of them had serious radiation injuries. Thirteen
people exposed to total body doses ranging from 560 to 1,340 rads
of radiation were given bone marrow transplants in an effort to
restore their bodies' ability to make blood cells.
   A rad is a measurement of radiation. Gale said that those with
exposures below 200 rads can be treated with transfusions and
antibiotics, while people with exposures between 200 and 800 rads
can probably be saved with blood cell growth factors.
   At higher radiation levels, he said, ``you won't have enough
remaining bone marrow cells to stimulate with these factors, and
you are going to have to consider transplantation, pretty much in
the way we did'' after Chernobyl.
   The two who survived after the bone marrow operations found that
their bodies eventually rejected the transplanted tissue. Gale said
this shows that transplants can keep people alive until their own
bone marrow recovers.
   Most of the rest died of severe burns and other damage caused by
radiation.
   ``I am disappointed, because we invested such a huge amount in
these cases,'' said Gale. ``You want everyone to live. But this is
not designed to rescue people dying of non-bone marrow failure.''
   Gale has since used blood cell growth factors on people who came
in contact with radioactive cesium 137 that was removed from a
partly demolished cancer treatment center in Brazil and on people
accidentally exposed to cobalt 60 at a sterilization plant in El
Salvador.
   These natural hormones, which are produced through gene
splicing, can prompt the remaining bone marrow cells to work
harder, producing more blood cells.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. Christine K.
Cassel of the University of Chicago and Jennifer Leaning of Harvard
said the latest work ``adds greatly to our knowledge of the
management of acute radiation injury.''
