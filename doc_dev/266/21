<LEADPARA>  Fire broke out Friday night in a generator at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant in the Soviet Ukraine, but the blaze was put out, a spokesman said. A
massive 1986 explosion and fire at the plant spewed radiation around the
world.;   No injuries or radiation release were reported from the blaze and
reactor No. 2 was immediately shut down, said a recorded telephone statement
early today by the plant 80 miles north of Kiev.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The blaze broke out at 8:09 p.m. Friday and the reactor was idled one
minute later, the statement said. The fire was extinguished, it said.;   The
extent of damage was not immediately known and there was no word on the cause,
though the plant's three reactors remaining in operation since the 1986
accident have been criticized for lax safety standards.;   Earlier, Russian
Radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. reported from its
correspondent in the Ukraine that the roof of one of the generating rooms of
the atomic station was on fire early today. It gave no other details.;   CNN
reported that a television station in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, had told
its correspondent the fire was under control and there was no danger of a
release of radioactivity.;   Telephones did not answer early today at the
Chernobyl cleanup office, a regional radiation center or the Ukrainian
government office in Moscow. The state news agency Tass carried no immediate
report about the fire.;   An explosion on April 26, 1986, in the No. 4 reactor
at Chernobyl started a massive fire. Soviet authorities say 32 people died as
a direct result of the explosion, the worst disaster in the history of nuclear
power.;   Vladimir Chernousenko, the scientific director of the 20-mile
exclusion zone around the plant, said in April that the disaster had claimed
up to 10,000 lives, and accused Moscow of covering up the true effects of the
accident.;   The three other reactors at Chernobyl continued operating after
the disaster, although some have shut down temporarily. It wasn't known at
which of the reactors the latest accident occurred.;   The Ukrainian
government said in March 1990 it planned to close Chernobyl altogether within
five years.;   The Tass news agency reported Oct. 1 that a protective shield
to prevent radiation from leaking out of the No. 4 reactor did not meet safety
standards and should be reinforced.;   The immense steel and concrete
"sarcophagus" was built around Reactor No. 4 after the explosion, which spewed
radiation across the Ukraine, Byelorussia and much of Europe.;   The Soviet
Union recently agreed to allow international atomic energy experts to inspect
its Chernobyl-type reactors for nuclear safety. The RBMK graphite-moderated
water-cooled reactors account for about half the nuclear power in the Soviet
Union.;   Reactors of this type also have been key to the economies of the
Soviet Union's former allies in Eastern Europe.;   The Chernobyl accident
heightened world consciousness about the threat of nuclear power and helped
spawn an environmental movement in the Soviet Union.;   The Soviet government
blamed the steam explosion on human error during a "routine shutdown" of the
reactor. But many Soviet and Western experts also fault the 1,000-megawatt
RBMK reactor's design, which is not permitted in most Western countries.;  
Last month, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Ivan Selin
investigated Chernobyl and said it barely passes acceptable safety standards.;
  Selin said Monday that while the former Eastern Bloc countries are seeking
technology from the West to improve their nuclear power programs, there are
few signs that safety is improving.;   On Friday, Tom Andrews, an official
with the NRC in Rockville, Md., and Anthony Marinze of the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna said they were unaware of the fire except for
news reports.;   "We have not heard anything from our channels," Andrews said.  </TEXT>
