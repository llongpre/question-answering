   A Soviet official said it could take
more than 200 years to clean up damage from the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident and asked for international aid to help 2 million
people affected by the disaster.
   The sudden plea _ more than four years after the accident _
comes after Soviet scientists said the situation was much worse
than Moscow had portrayed.
   One-fifth of the republic of Byelorussia's more than 10 million
people have to be moved from areas contaminated by radiation, said
Victor Borovikov, a Byelorussia diplomat. He said that includes 27
cities and more than 2,600 villages.
   Byelorussia, which has no nuclear power plants, was hit by 70fallout
from the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl,
in the Soviet Republic of Ukraine.
   Borovikov said 25,000 people were ev
percent of the acuated after the April 26,
1986, nuclear plant disaster. But, he said, ``then Moscow said
there was no panic, no danger. In the past four years we've
realized the situation was not so simple.''
   He said the republic had planned to spend $14 billion to move
180,000 people from the high-radiation zone by the end of 1995 but
would now try to do it by the end of 1991.
   Borovikov was in Brussels for the departure Wednesday of a truck
convoy carrying donated children'He said experts now say it could take
up to 200 years ``to
totally wipe out'' effects of the accident, so authorities are
focusing on reducing the damage.
   ``We have no experience in this field, which is why we're asking
for international help,'' said Borovikov, the republic's U.N.
ambassador in Vienna.
   Borovikov said immediately after the accident people were paid
by the Soviet authorities to stay in the contaminated zones but
they now are demanding immediate relocation.
   He said people in uncontaminated areas don't ``want to accept
the newcomers. They tell their children not to play with the
children of the newcomers.''
   At least 31 people were killed after a nuclear reactor exploded
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It was the worst nuclear
accident in history.
