   The Senate has voted unanimously to ratify two
international conventions that were prompted largely by the
Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in the Soviet Union.
   The accords, approved by a 97-0 vote Wednesday, were negotiated
under auspices of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency.
   In the wake of the April 1986 Chernobyl accident, Moscow came
under heavy criticism for delaying release of information on the
reactor explosion to the outside world until large amounts of
airborne radioactivity were detected in Sweden.
   Representatives of more than 60 countries met in the summer of
1986 to negotiate the two pacts: the Convention on Early
Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance
in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency.
   The notification convention has been signed by 72 countries,
while the assistance convention has 70 signatories.
   In urging ratification, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the two conventions
``positive international achievements'' that could prove invaluable
in case of another Chernobyl-scale nuclear accident.
   Under the early notification convention, each signatory nation
pledges prompt notification of other affected countries and the
atomic energy agency in case of a nuclear accident that is likely
to result in the spread of radioactivity beyond its borders.
   Information to be provided includes:
   _The time, exact location and nature of the accident.
   _The nuclear facility or activity involved.
   _The assumed or established cause and foreseeable further
development of the accident.
   _Characteristics of the radioactivity released by the accident.
   _Weather conditions.
   _Environmental monitoring and protective measures taken or
planned in the vicinity of the accident.
   The second convention establishes an international legal
framework for assistance by other nations in case it is requested
by the government of a country hit by a major nuclear accident. It
seeks to encourage such help, while not obligating any nation to
provide assistance.
