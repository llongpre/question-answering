   Public fear of nuclear power and
unexpected criticism from the press suddenly have made Soviet
officials strikingly defensive about their efforts to deal with the
effects of the Chernobyl disaster.
   Comments by some officials during a conference on the medical
effects of the accident and a tour of the mammoth Chernobyl nuclear
power plant last week suggested they are worried that public
opposition could halt development of nuclear power in the Soviet
Union.
   The April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant's
No. 4 reactor killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of
radioactive material that eventually circled the globe.
   The Soviets were severely criticized in the West for not
immediately reporting the accident. Since then, they have opened an
international media center at Chernobyl, given more than 180 tours
of the plant and made other efforts to provide information about
their efforts to clean up after the accident.
   But even before getting down to the main work of their three-day
conference in Kiev, officials several times cited evidence of what
they called ``radiophobia,'' or an unreasonable fear of nuclear
power, among Soviet citizens.
   Alexander Kovalenko, chief spokesman for Kombinat, a state-run
organization that oversees the Chernobyl plant and the 18-mile
exclusion zone around it, said ``the public conception of the
accident was not less important than the technical problems.''
   Soviet specialists acknowledged that rumors of radioactive leaks
at Chernobyl still sweep Kiev, the capital of the Soviet Ukraine,
80 miles south of the plant.
   They said some people are afraid to have children because they
fear birth defects induced by radiation. Stress and stress-related
medical problems linked to the disaster are on the rise.
   Leonid Ilyin, head of the Soviet Institute of Biophysics,
described ``radiophobia'' as a psychological and political problem
that could damage the future of nuclear power. Rejection of nuclear
power is a ``lack of understanding of the reality of today, when
there is no alternative,'' he said.
   The Soviet media have reported that public opposition has halted
construction of nuclear power plants near the southern Ukrainian
city of Odessa, the Byelorussian capital of Minsk and the southern
Russian city of Krasnodar.
   Such action is extremely rare in a country where the only
protests for years have been conducted only by small bands of
dissenters.
   Despite the Chernobyl accident, the Soviet Union has committed
itself to an ambitious nuclear power program. Last April, Andranik
Petrosyants, head of the Soviet Atomic Energy Commission, said the
country planned to double the amount of electricity produced by
nuclear power between 1985 and 1990.
   The Soviets stressed that except for those who were treated for
radiation sickness immediately after the Chernobyl accident, they
have found no medical effects of the fire.
   They criticized American doctor Robert Gale and others who
publicize estimates of the possible number of cancer deaths from
the Chernobyl accident.
   Gale retorted that with the lack of such information provided by
Soviet scientists, ``Many people in Kiev worry about what will
happen to them.''
   Cancers caused by exposure to radiation from the plant could
take decades to form, doctors said.
   Kovalenko and Chernobyl plant manager Mikhail Umanets also were
stung by sharp criticism from an unexpected source, the official
Soviet media.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda on April 24 complained of
shoddy work, drunkenness and nepotism at the Chernobyl plant.
   Umanets said in a meeting with reporters at the Chernobyl plant
that some of the criticisms were justified of Kombinat in general,
but not of workers at the Chernobyl plant.
   Kovalenko said he considered the Pravda article ``extremely
harmful'' but would use it to clear up misconceptions. The paper's
article cannot be considered a statement backed by the
policy-making Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, he
said.
   On a tour of the Chernobyl plant and its surroundings, officials
used radiation counters to stress to reporters that radiation
levels were not dangerous for the relatively brief periods for
which workers now are exposed.
   Kovalenko said 400 workers are housed for two weeks at a time in
Pripyat, about a mile from the Chernobyl plant. The city of almost
50,000 where plant workers once lived in large apartment blocks was
hurriedly evacuated 36 hours after the accident and has not been
resettled.
   Kovalenko said officials also have allowed as many as 500
elderly people who once lived inside the exclusion zone to return,
even though it technically is illegal.
   They face no danger, he said.
