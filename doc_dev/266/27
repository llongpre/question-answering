   Swedes in the northern region of Lapland still suffer from the fallout of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, more than two years after the Soviet disaster, according to a study. 

   Recent tests on a group of 30 Lapp reindeer herdsmen showed cesium levels in two-thirds of them were above the safety limit, which the National Radiation Protection Agency has set at 90,000 bequerel. 

   A bequerel is a unit that measures the activity of a radioactive substance such as cesium-137, an element of the nuclear fallout. 

   The herdsmen eat the meat of reindeer that graze on plants polluted by radioactivity from the April 1986 nuclear accident in the Soviet Ukraine, according to the tests, done at the Institution for Radiophysics in the eastern city of Umea. 

   The average radiation level for males in Lapland is about 55,000 bequerel, while the average for a control group of staff at a hospital was 2,000 bequerel, the institution said.
