<HEAD>Lapps In Sweden Still Suffer From Chernobyl Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedes in the northern region of
Lapland still suffer from the fallout of the Chernobyl nuclear
accident, more than two years after the Soviet disaster, according
to a study.
   Recent tests on a group of 30 Lapp reindeer herdsmen showed
cesium levels in two-thirds of them were above the safety limit,
which the National Radiation Protection Agency has set at 90,000
bequerel.
   The bequerel is a unit that measures the activity of a
radioactive substance such as cesium-137, an element of the nuclear
fallout.
   The herdsmen eat the meat of reindeer that graze on plants
polluted by radioactivity from the April 1986 nuclear accident in
the Soviet Ukraine, according to the tests, done at the Institution
for Radiophysics in the eastern city of Umea.
   The average radiation level for males in Lapland is about 55,000
bequerel, while the average for a control group of staff at a
hospital was 2,000 bequerel, the institution reported.
