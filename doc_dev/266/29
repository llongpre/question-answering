<LEADPARA>  The United States' nuclear reactors suffered 177 emergency shutdowns in 1990,
any one of which could have mushroomed into a disaster such as the Chernobyl
explosion that occurred five years ago today, according to a study released
Thursday by the anti-nuclear group Public Citizen.;    "The possibility of a
Chernobyl occurring in the United States is very real," Public Citizen's
president, Joan Claybrook, warned as she released the 90-page report based on
data from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Department.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Representatives of the NRC and the nuclear industry challenged Claybrook's
comparison to Chernobyl, saying the Soviet plant's crude design was not
comparable to U.S. facilities, which are safer. However, they declined to
directly challenge the report's data, saying they had not had time to evaluate
it.;    Last year's incidents;  The report's NRC and Energy Department data
show that in 1990 the United States' 111 licensed commercial nuclear plants
suffered:;    (check) 177 automatic emergency shutdowns;;    (check) 1,921
breakdowns of systems or procedures;;    (check) 894 violations of safety
regulations;;    (check) 125 activations of emergency core-cooling or
emergency power systems;;    (check) 38 NRC-designated "significant events"
that potentially threatened public safety;;    (check) 404 failures of reactor
safety systems involving multiple-component breakdowns.;    In addition,
nuclear-plant workers were exposed to measurable amounts of radiation 107,662
times in 1989, more than 1988's 103,501. The combined total radiation exposure
equals 2 million chest X-rays, Public Citizen said.;    Worst nuclear
accident;  A Soviet reactor at Chernobyl had an explosion and fire April 26,
1986. It was the worst commercial nuclear power accident in history.;   
Soviet authorities pegged the official death toll at 31 in 1990. But dissident
Soviet officials now say the toll was closer to 300, and Chernobyl's senior
scientist has put the estimate at 10,000.;    In addition, Soviet scientists
project that 5,200 people will die of cancer within 70 years because of direct
exposure to radiation from the accident. Claybrook cited estimates that
cancers could total 270,000.;    'No resemblance';  "Chernobyl has no
resemblance to a U.S. plant," said Steve Unglesbee of the U.S. Council for
Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's public relations group. "It could not
have been licensed here at all.";    The Chernobyl reactor did not have a
containment shell, whereas U.S. reactors are covered by shells with walls four
feet thick made of concrete and reinforced steel, NRC spokesman John Kopeck
said.;    However, Soviet investigators concluded in 1986 that a series of
human errors were more responsible for the Chernobyl disaster than any flaw in
technological design.;    Hundreds of human errors;  And human errors by the
hundreds continue to mar U.S. nuclear operations annually, according to Public
Citizen's report.;    NRC data show that 72 percent of U.S. nuclear plant
mishaps in 1987 stemmed from human error, more than double the one-third rate
in 1979. "Since Chernobyl, not much has improved in the U.S. industry," said
Ken Bosson, director of Public Citizen's nuclear studies.;    NRC spokesman
Kopeck said last year's 177 emergency shutdowns showed that U.S. plants work
as designed: "If it does occur, the plant is doing its job, shutting down
safely." He said such shutdowns often occur during a nuclear plant's first
year, when "various glitches have to be worked out."  </TEXT>
