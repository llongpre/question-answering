<HEAD>Soviets Confirm Accident at Leningrad Nuclear Plant in 1975</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union confirmed Thursday
that a major accident occurred at a nuclear power plant in
Leningrad in 1975, Finnish officials said.
   The officials said the nuclear reactors in the Leningrad plant
were similar to those at Chernobyl and that the accident was
``possibly of grade 3 _ in other words, a serious accident.''
   Radioactivity spread over parts of northern Europe in April 1986
after the reactor exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the
Soviet republic of Ukraine. At least 31 people were killed as a
direct result of that nuclear accident, the worst in history.
   However, the Finnish Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety
said no radiation from the 1975 accident was detected in Finland,
60 miles at the nearest point from the plant. It made no mention of
any casualties.
   The center said the accident occurred when ``the fuel channel of
the number one reactor unit at the Leningrad nuclear plant was
damaged on Nov. 30, 1975, when it was started up, and short-term
radioactive substances were released into the atmosphere.''
   The recorded message said the information came from Soviet
nuclear officials after inquiries Thursday by the Finnish center.
   The message said, according to Soviet authorities, the release
of radioactivity was far less than the 1.5 million curies reported
in earlier press accounts. The Soviets have said 50 million curies
of radiation were released in the Chernobyl accident.
   ``Officials saw no reason to take special measures in the
immediate vicinity of the power plant, and the reactor was back in
use two weeks after the incident,'' the message added.
