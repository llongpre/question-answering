GHOST towns are scattered across the fields and marshes around the Chernobyl
nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident. A
wire fence, 10 kilometres in radius, stops anyone but the plant's operators
and a few scientists and visitors from entering this silent, poisoned zone.
The explosion at Chernobyl in April 1986 is the shadow that hangs over the
world's nuclear industry. It left thousands of acres of farmland in Belarus,
Ukraine and Russia contaminated beyond recovery, and thousands of people
exposed to radiation - the consequences for their health are still unknown.
Yet last month the Ukrainian government reversed its earlier decision to
close down the remaining three reactors at Chernobyl by the end of the year
because of the cost of buying oil and gas from Russia. Instead, work is
underway to repair the second of the three reactors, which has been out of
operation for two years following a fire.
That decision illustrates the problem facing a handful of the world's poorer
countries: they have few alternatives to nuclear power, but lack the cash,
technicians and management to run them safely. It presents richer countries
with a challenge of how best to deploy assistance and funds to solve what is
clearly an international threat: radioactive dust from Chernobyl reached
much of western Europe.
The public hostility to nuclear power provoked by Chernobyl also raised the
question of how high richer countries' nuclear standards should be.
Safety measures in Western Europe, Japan and North America - pushed steadily
higher by powerful 'green' pressure groups and public opinion - are
responsible for a large proportion of the costs of nuclear power, though one
that is hard to quantify.
Recent Western efforts to improve the safety of the 58 Soviet-designed
reactors in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have focused on the
25 worst. In particular, they have targeted Kozloduy in Bulgaria and
Ignalina in Lithuania.
Two years ago, Kozloduy was condemned as the world's most dangerous nuclear
plant by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the
Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, which found that it lacked even the emergency
cooling system standard in western reactors.
Since then, Western European nuclear experts have been training the
operators and ordering pipes and valves to be strengthened, as part of a
programme run by the World Association of Nuclear Operators, an organisation
set up three years after Chernobyl to promote high standards of nuclear
management.
In June this year, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development also
approved a 24m Ecu grant to improve fire protection, cooling systems and
valves.
At Ignalina, an IAEA report in February cited a long list of safety concerns
including inadequate systems to relieve steam pressure. Efforts to upgrade
the plant are being led by Sweden, the first country outside Ukraine to
detect the Chernobyl explosion, and just across the Baltic Sea from
Ignalina.
So far, the Swedish government has paid SKr70m (Pounds 5.7m), with another
SKr53.2m due next year to upgrade equipment and improve management.
But funds have so far fallen short of the problem: estimates have put the
cost of thorough improvements at between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn.
Moreover, progress has been handicapped by western companies' concerns about
sharing in liability for the plants. Some have told the IAEA that they are
worried that if there are accidents at the plants, they could be held to
blame because their name is on some of the equipment.
Awareness of the urgent problems at the eastern reactors has also heightened
public pressures in richer countries for close scrutiny of nuclear
standards. Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, the
environmental pressure group, has attacked western governments for paying
too little to improve the 'rickety reactors' of eastern Europe or for
developing alternatives to nuclear power at home.
The UK's Health and Safety Executive, which licenses nuclear installations,
in a detailed and thoughtful report last year, pointed out that assessing
the risk of disaster in nuclear plants is extremely difficult, as it
consists of the judging the probabilities of failure in many interconnected
pieces of equipment. Some of the factors, such as human error, which was
responsible for the accidents at Chernobyl and at Three Mile Island in the
US, are 'of their nature very hard to estimate,' it comments.
It observes, too, that people will tolerate much higher levels of risk in
events they can control, such as riding motorcycles, than they will in
others such as nuclear power or water quality. They have a particular fear
of radiation, frequently out of proportion to the risks of exposure: many
seem to rate death by radiation as worse than a death in a traffic accident,
the HSE comments.
Its conclusion is that safety standards in any future nuclear plants -
although the government has not yet decided whether to lift a moratorium on
building new plants - should be set so that the risk to the public is at
least 10 times less than that of a traffic accident. This is a much higher
standard that that for non-nuclear plants, it points out.
The result of these pressures is an uncomfortable future for nuclear
operators in richer countries. They face pressure at home for tighter and
more expensive safety standards at a point when many governments are
scrutinising the economics of nuclear power closely.
But they know, too, that much of the world's nuclear industry is run on much
lower standards, a problem which international organisations have not yet
successfully addressed. The risk they face, which they cannot control, is
that another Chernobyl will irrevocably turn public opinion against nuclear
power. It is in the nuclear industry's interest that the eastern problems
are tackled soon.
