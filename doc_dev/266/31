   Scientists said Wednesday that Soviets
still suffer psychological scars from the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster more than two years after it took place.
   Soviet and Western scientists could reach no consensus on the
number of deaths that eventually may be linked to the explosion and
fire that destroyed the No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl power plant
on April 26, 1986.
   An American doctor said cases of leukemia may begin to appear in
one to three years. A Soviet scientist said the number of voluntary
abortions in areas of Byelorussia near the plant increased 20
percent in the months after the accident.
   At least 31 people were killed at the plant 80 miles north of
Kiev, capital of the Soviet Ukraine. A huge cloud of invisible
radiation spread over Europe and eventually worked its way around
the world.
   Wednesday was the first day of three days devoted to a
conference on medical consequences of the disaster. It brought more
than 160 Soviet scientists together with delegates from 24 foreign
countries.
   ``The accident was very severe but the wounds are healing,''
said Hans Blix, general director of the International Atomic Energy
Agency. He said nuclear plants remain a feasible source of
electricity despite the accident.
   Yevgeny Chazov, the Soviet health minister, said in an opening
statement: ``Soviet scientists have no reason to conceal anything
about the accident.''
   Several Soviet delegates said the nation must combat what they
called ``radiophobia,'' an unreasonable fear of nuclear power.
   Oles Pyatak, deputy director of the Soviet Center for Radiation
Medicine, said scientists had noted increases in tension and
intestinal disorders attributable to stress, and the unwillingness
of some couples to have children. Viktor Knizhnikov, who heads a
radiation-safety laboratory, said rumors arose periodically about
the Chernobyl plant leaking radiation again. Reports in the
official press have said public opposition halted construction of
nuclear plants near Odessa in the southern Ukraine, the
Byelorussian capital of Minsk and Krasnodar in southern Russia.
   Knizhnikov told reporters of a 20 percent increase in voluntary
abortions in areas of Byelorussia just north of Chernobyl following
the accident.
   He said there was no evidence of an increase in spontaneous
abortions or birth defects, and virtually no chance any children
would have been born deformed.
   The high rate of abortions continued through 1986 but the number
then returned to normal, he said.
   Specialists have said the disaster could add 30,000 cancer
deaths to the 600 million expected in the next 50 years, said
Robert Gale, an American doctor who helped treat the worst cases of
radiation sickness.
   Half the extra cases would be in the Soviet Union, 40 percent in
the rest of Europe and the remaining 10 percent in North America
and Asia, he said.
   Gale emphasized that the figures were estimates and said: ``My
own feeling is that they may be on the high side, maybe by a factor
of 10.''
   An increase in leukemia also might be noticeable in one to three
years among the 135,000 people who were evacuated from an 18-mile
zone around the plant, Gale said.
   An extra 100 cases would be significant and easily detectable,
he said, and ``one may be able to precisely identify the cases
caused by radiation.''
   Some other American doctors disputed that.
   Fred Mettler, a radiologist and specialist in nuclear medicine
at the University of New Mexico, said there is no way to determine
the cause of a particular case of cancer.
   Because of a lack of information about how much and what kinds
of radiation people were exposed to, firm conclusions about the
medical effects would be difficult to reach, he said.
   Soviet officials said they had not been prepared to deal with
the Chernobyl accident and did not have enough trained workers or
reliable equipment to monitor the radiation.
   The accident was not even reported until three days after it
happened, when Sweden detected high radiation levels and demanded
an explanation.
   Their Western colleagues said the Soviets have done a good job
since.
   Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency said
modifications of Soviet nuclear plants now under way would prevent
another accident of the Chernobyl type.
