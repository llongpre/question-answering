<LEADPARA>  Plutonium and other radioactive wastes from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
accident are spreading through the topsoil, vegetation and reservoirs of a
broad swath of the Soviet Union and continue to threaten the health of a
growing number of people who inhale or ingest them, according to a senior
Soviet scientist.;    Yevgeny Konoplya, director of the Radiobiology Institute
of the Byelorussian Academy of Sciences, said in an interview that the
institute's research shows that radioactive contamination, spread by wind and
water, is menacing people hundreds of miles from the damaged reactor
previously thought to be at minimal risk.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We have challenged the government," he said in an interview at the Soviet
Embassy last week. "We said the situation is more difficult than has been
presented" in Soviet government statements and previous analyses of the health
effects of the world's worst nuclear accident.;    No consensus;  There is no
scientific consensus on the long-term human health consequences of the
Chernobyl disaster. The official death toll from the fire and explosion at the
reactor is 31, mostly among firefighters who battled the blaze unprotected
against the lethal doses of radiation released by the blast.;    Reports by
the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization and an
International Red Cross team have found that fears of widespread illness are
greater than the apparent reality. They said Soviet citizens have been
attributing many illnesses to presumed radiation exposure when no such link
has been demonstrated, and they suggested that anxiety and stress were
responsible for some reported illnesses.;    Konoplya acknowledged that the
data is and will remain fragmentary and inconclusive. The patterns of
contamination and exposure are so varied, he said, that he would not estimate
the number of people in danger or say how far from Chernobyl the danger
extends. Many people in the contaminated areas are healthy, and others suffer
from illnesses that cannot be attributed to Chernobyl.;    Chronic diseases
increasing;  "Various chronic diseases are increasing in number," he said.
"Research in my institute shows the endocrine system is weakened, immunity
against infection is weakened. Also the character of illnesses changes; they
are of longer duration and more severe. . . . The digestive system changes."; 
  He also said "chromosome changes" had been observed that carry "an increase
of risk of genetic damage. There can be recuperation of this system if people
are isolated from the sources of radiation, but if we don't do anything, the
process will increase.";    About 200,000 people in Byelorussia and the
Ukraine have been evacuated from their homes, and 110,000 more are awaiting
relocation. But nearly 5 million live in areas contaminated by fallout.;   
According to Konoplya, these people are in danger of inhaling plutonium in
dust kicked up by the wind. Plutonium, a radioactive byproduct of the nuclear
chain reaction, is lethal when inhaled even in tiny amounts.  </TEXT>
