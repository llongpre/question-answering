<HEAD>Muscovite Fights Construction on Suspected Nuclear Dump Site</HEAD>

   A former government employee went to court Monday
seeking to halt construction of apartments and an underground
garage on a site he claims was a nuclear dump.
   Oleg Lyanin said the site, along the Leninsky Prospekt
thoroughfare in south Moscow, was used to bury wastes from uranium
processing at the beginning of the Soviet nuclear effort in the
1940s.
   No official evidence has been released that the dump exists and
there is no evidence of nuclear leaks, the Moscow man said in a
telephone interview. But he claimed scientists involved in the
nuclear effort have pinpointed the spot and several others as the
sites of nuclear dumps.
   ``We're sure there's a map, perhaps several made at different
intervals of where and what is in Moscow,'' said Lyanin, a former
negotiator and translator for the Ministry of Foreign Trade.
   He said he filed his first court documents April 10 asking that
the case be turned over to prosecutors for investigation of
possible criminal charges. He said that request was granted three
days later.
   According to a law passed after the Chernobyl nuclear accident,
disturbing buried radioactive waste is punishable by up to 10 years
in prison, according to Lyanin.
   He said that in his court appearance Monday he asked the court
to halt construction of the garage and apartments to ``leave
trouble where it lies.''
   There has been much greater concern in the Soviet Union about
nuclear safety since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in
April 1986. At least 31 people perished when a reactor exploded.
   The site for the garage and apartments in southern Moscow is
less than a half-mile from the Anglo-American School, whose 200
pupils include children of diplomats and business representatives
from the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.
   The director of the Anglo-American School, Vera Nordal, said
Soviet officials have not contacted the school about the matter.
   She said British officials checked the area for radiation Monday
and tests conducted by the U.S. Embassy following the Chernobyl
accident did not turn up radiation near the school.
   Lyanin said the planned apartments would be occupied by members
of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Republic and officials
of the Central Council of Trade Unions.
   He said excavation for the $24 million project began recently
but has been halted pending a decision on his petitions in the
Dzerzhinsky region People's Court.
   Residents of the region have held several meetings to oppose the
construction project, according to Lyanin.
