<HEAD>Soviet Says $320 Billion Needed To Cope With Chernobyl
Consequences</HEAD>

   A member of the Soviet Parliament said Thursday
that about $320 billion will be needed to cope with the
consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster during the next 10
years.
   Yuri Shtsherbak, vice chairman of the Supreme Soviet's
Commission on Environment and Nuclear Energy, told reporters an
international fund should be set up to assist the Soviet Union.
   Shtsherbak said almost 4 million people are still living in
regions with higher than normal levels of radiation. The accident
occurred April 26, 1986 at the power plant, in the Soviet Ukraine.
   Shtsherbak's commission came up with proposals at the request of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They include a call for the
immediate evacuation of more than 100,000 people in the most
contaminated areas of Byelorussia, the Ukraine and the Russian
republic, according to Shtsherbak.
   He said the thyroid glands of more than 1.5 million people,
including 160,000 children, were exposed to ``important levels of
radiation'' after the Chernobyl disaster. In the Ukraine, the
incidence of thyroid cancer was expected to increase as much as
10-fold, Shtsherbak said.
   There are also considerably more cases of Leukemia and immunity
deficiencies. ``We call that Chernobyl AIDS,'' he added. ``We
believe this is only the beginning.''
   People in the affected region ``are living under great nervous
stress, socially, politically and psychologically,'' he said.
   Shtsherbak said his commission proposed that the government
issue a worldwide appeal for contributions to an international
Chernobyl relief fund. The estimate of needed funds over the next
decade was based on surveys made by the three republics affected.
   According to official figures, 31 people were killed in the
Chernobyl accident, caused by an explosion at the No. 4 reactor of
the four-unit plant.
   By 1989, officials said more than 250 people who had worked at
the plant or who were involved in the post-accident cleanup had
died of various causes, not all of them necessarily traceable to
radiation exposure.
