   Restrictions on the slaughter of 15,854 sheep in
Britain, imposed after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, have
been lifted because tests show they do not contain unsafe levels of
radiation, the Agriculture Ministry said today.
   Restrictions on the movement and slaughter of 469,000 other
sheep on 757 farms in western Britain and Northern Ireland remain
in effect, said ministry spokeswoman Coral Hill.
   Ms. Hill said that as of Wednesday, the 15,854 sheep which were
in contaminated areas between Sept. 25, 1987, and Jan. 10, 1988, no
longer had to be tested for safe radiation levels before being
slaughtered because of the ``substantial fall in radioactivity
levels.''
   Heavy rain fell in the peaty, sheep-rearing hills of
northwestern England, northern Wales, southwestern Scotland and
parts of Northern Ireland, shortly after the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant explositon in the Soviet Union on April 26, 1986. The
rain carried radioactive fallout.
