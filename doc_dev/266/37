<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Invite Swedes to Study Chernobyl Damage</HEAD>

   Sweden will send radiation experts to a
badly contaminated area in the Soviet Union to study the effects of
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, Soviet scientists
said Wednesday.
   The agreement was announced at the end of three days of talks by
Soviet, Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian officials on international
cooperation in the event of nuclear accidents.
   Pavel Ramzaev of the Institute of Radiation Hygiene in Leningrad
said the Soviets hoped to gain a broader view of contamination
problems.
   ``Our vast material and data from the affected areas is only a
first step toward knowledge about the effects of the accident,''
Ramzaev said, adding that the Soviets were seeking ``new ways of
thinking.''
   A Swedish team will go this summer to an area in the Russian
republic several hundred miles northeast of Chernobyl, where
radiation levels were far higher than expected.
   ``We have a lot to learn about the medical effects on human
life, and how to measure and decontaminate agriculture land and the
environment in general,'' said Jan Olof Snihs, of Sweden's National
Institute of Radiation Protection.
   The Soviets said a conference in Vienna starting Friday will
discuss the organization of an international research institute to
be established at Chernobyl.
   The April 26, 1986, explosion at the No. 4 reactor of the
four-unit nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine was the world's
worst atomic accident.
   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of
northern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from
several countries. The plant is 80 miles north of the Ukraine
capital of Kiev.
   Two workers died immediately of burns they suffered in the
explosion, 28 died shortly after the accident from radiation
exposure, and one died of a heart attack while fighting the fire.
By 1989, officials said more than 250 people who had worked at the
polant or who were involved in the post-accident cleanup had died
of various causes, not all of them necessarily traceable to
radiation exposure.
