   The dollar surged yesterday amid rumors, which were later denied, of a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union. 

   Denials came from officials in Moscow and Stockholm, where the rumors apparently began. 
The U.S. State Department also said the U.S. had no reports of increased radiation. 
Still, speculation that nuclear fallout might affect Europe continued to push the dollar higher and lifted most commodity prices throughout much of the day. 

   The Japanese yen rose sharply against major West European currencies in part because of the accident rumors. 
Its gain also was attributed to the relative strength of the Japanese economy and interest rates. 

   In Tokyo, the dollar opened at 128.20 yen Thursday, up from 127.88 at the end of Japanese trading Wednesday. 

   The dollar's rise yesterday was similar to its surge immediately following reports of the 1986 Soviet nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl power plant. 
Speculators then reasoned, as they did again yesterday, that the potential of radioactive fallout could severely hurt the European economies. 
There was also speculation that any crop damage resulting from a Soviet nuclear accident would result in increased demand for American agricultural exports, and in turn, increased demand for dollars to buy U.S. produce. 

   The dollar also benefited yesterday as a "safe haven" currency. 
"Theoretically, if there's a nuclear accident that's as substantial as Chernobyl, you get nuclear stuff and clouds and the safest place to be is miles and miles away, like the U.S.," said Robert K. Ryan, vice president of foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., New York. 
"That's why people bought dollars." 

   In late New York trading the dollar was quoted near its highs of the day. 
The dollar stood at 1.6928 West German marks, up 0.6% from 1.6825 Tuesday. 
The U.S. currency climbed 0.7% to 1.3830 Swiss francs, from 1.3730. 

   Against the Japanese currency the dollar was unchanged yesterday at 128.25 yen as the yen strengthened against most other major currencies. 
For instance, the mark fell 0.6% to 75.76 yen, from 76.23. 

   The yen also appeared to benefit from the nuclear accident rumors. 
"I guess the winds blowing over Russia were blowing toward Europe and away from Japan," said Gary Dorsch, a money market analyst at LNS Financial Group Inc., a clearing firm on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 

   Traders primarily cited Japan's relatively healthy economy for the yen's strength. 
Also, firm Japanese interest rates stand in contrast to easing rates in Europe and the U.S., traders said. 
As a result, interest-rate spreads between Japan and the rest of the world have moved in favor of yen-denominated investments, adding to demand for the Japanese currency. 

   "If you isolate any country in the world for consistent growth you have to look at Japan," said Charles A. Luma, vice president of foreign exchange at Industrial Bank of Japan's New York branch. 
He added that Japan will likely keep interest rates stable while rates elsewhere may need to fall in order to stimulate growth and avoid recession. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $15.20 an ounce to $438.70 in heavy trading. 
The estimated volume was six million ounces. 

   The plunge in the price of gold was sparked by heavy Soviet selling and rumors that the country would need to sell more gold to purchase food imports if a nuclear accident had occurred. 

   Gold was quoted at $441.75 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.
