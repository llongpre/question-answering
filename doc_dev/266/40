For most Ukrainians, the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident was the final
indictment of Soviet rule. Kiev citizens are still bitter about the infamous
May Day parade, in which their children were required to march outdoors
while the reactor core still burned less than 150 km to the north.
'The Chernobyl accident shattered my final illusions about the totalitarian
system,' says Iuri Kostenko, Ukraine's reformist minister of the
environment. 'Now, independent Ukraine has been stuck with the bill for
Chernobyl.'
According to new scientific research, that bill may be even higher than was
previously thought. Ukrainian officials recently estimated the death toll
related to Chernobyl at 8,000 so far, and Kostenko estimates that the health
of two-thirds of Ukraine's 52m people has been harmed by the accident.
But Ukrainian and western researchers scientists claim that more radiation
was released than previously believed and that ineffective clean-up measures
pose grave dangers. According to their findings, thousands of tonnes of
material dropped by helicopters over the burning reactor core during the
first 10 days after the accident was off target. Consequently, the fire was
not extinguished but simply burnt itself out.
Alexander Burovoi, head of the permanent team researching the accident, and
Alexander Sich, a student of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, say that because the core burnt freely for 10 days,
more radioactive particles were released than previously thought.
'The material dumped by helicopter could not have extinguished the fire
because visual evidence and chemical analysis of the melted core show that
it did not get into the reactor shaft,' Sich says.
Sich and Burovoi estimate that at least 35 per cent of the radiocaesium and
50 per cent of the radioiodine in the core were released. These figures are
double and in some cases triple those reported by the Soviet government in
1986.
The new conclusions drawn by Sich and Burovoi have particularly worrying
implications for the 600,000 people involved in the clean-up. They were
close enough to the reactor core as it burned to have been affected even by
those released radionuclides which have relatively short half-lives.
Moreover, the new research undermines a central tenet of the official
version of the Chernobyl clean-up campaign: the cult of the brave
'liquidators' who took action to put out the fire and whose youthful deaths
are honoured at a museum in Kiev. 'Saying the materials dropped by
helicopter did not land in the reactor shaft has a great psychological
significance,' Burovoi says. 'Think about all the radiation those firemen
and pilots were exposed to and all of it for naught.'
Scientists also point to two potential dangers caused by measures to contain
the accident. One is the steadily rising ground water around the Chernobyl
complex. To prevent radioactive particles from seeping into the Prypiat
river, an immense concrete wall, known as the Casa Grande, was built 30
metres into the ground between the reactor and the riverbank.
The unpredicted result, according to Sich, is that the Casa Grande is acting
as a sort of dam for the ground water, which has already climbed into the
bottom of the damaged fourth reactor and is only 1.5m from the melted core.
The second danger is the concrete sarcophagus built around the core.
Constructed at a distance while the core still emitted large amounts of
radioactive particles, it is a shaky, haphazardly built structure.
According to Mykola Steinberg, head of Ukraine's atomic energy regulatory
agency who was chief engineer at Chernobyl for the first 10 months after the
accident: 'From an engineering stand-point, no one can tell you what will
happen to the sarcophagus in the next half-hour.'
Despite these revelations about the effects of the accident and the
continuing danger Chernobyl presents, Ukrainian legislation calling for a
total shut-down of the reactor by the end of the year is increasingly being
questioned by the local nuclear lobby.
One objection, raised by Mykola Sorokin, director of the Chernobyl complex,
is that it is dangerous to close down a reactor in haste. 'It takes five
years to properly prepare a nuclear reactor to be shut down,' he says.
Sorokin raises another issue which strikes a more populist chord. In 1991
the three reactors at Chernobyl unaffected by the accident produced 5.2 per
cent of Ukraine's electricity, the equivalent of 6m tonnes of oil.
At a time when Russia is raising oil prices and restricting supply,
Sorokin's argument has growing force, but the Ukrainian leadership is still
committed to shutting down Chernobyl by the end of this year.
While many Ukrainians still cross-examine vegetable sellers to ensure their
food comes from nowhere near Chernobyl, at the nuclear power station - where
reactors one and three still hum along in the shadow of the sarcophagus - it
is business as usual.
The Chernobyl management has even created a special pennant bearing the
Chernobyl logo and commemorating the 15th anniversary of nuclear power in
Ukraine.
Typifying the peculiar world view of the Chernobylites, Sorokin pays his
workforce what the uninitiated might take for a back-handed compliment. 'Our
technicians are much better than their western counterparts,' Sorokin
boasts. 'Our personnel need to compensate for problems with our technology
through their own additional skills.'
Sorokin insists a second Chernobyl is impossible at any of the reactors of
the same type in the former Soviet Union, citing 3,400 modifications since
the accident. Oleksandr Berezin, chief operator at the third block,
disagrees. He says only 70 per cent of the flaws have been corrected.
Still, he believes fatalistically that the Chernobyl reactor should be kept
running because 'you cannot make the ecological situation worse than it is
already'.
