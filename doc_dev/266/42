   Here is a brief review of the Chernobyl nuclear
accident and its aftermath:

<TEXT>
   THE ACCIDENT _ On April 26, 1986, a fire started in one of the
four 1,000-megawatt reactors of the nuclear power station at
Chernobyl, 80 miles north of Kiev, captial of the Ukraine. A core
meltdown and explosion followed, sending huge quantities of
radiation into the atmosphere. The Soviets did not report the
accident until two days later, after Scandinavian complaints of
unsually high radiation levels.

   EVACUATION _ About 116,000 people were evacuated from
contaminated parts of the Ukraine and Byelorussia, most from a
9-mile radius of the plant. A pass is required to enter the area.
Last year, the government decided to evacuate 85 more villages in
Byelorussia, 31 in Russia and 14 in the Ukrain.

   DEATHS _ Two people were killed in the accident and 29 are
officially reported to have died of radiation sickness later. Yuri
Scherbak, a Ukrainian member of the national parliament, and others
say up to 250 have died. An official report commissioned in 1986
estimated 5,300 people would die over 70 years from cancer
resulting from radiation exposure.

   COST _ Current estimates of cleanup costs are 30 times the
original $8 billion rubles ($13 billion at the official exchange
rate). Surveys by the three republics affected indicate the cost
may reach 250 billion rubles ($405 billion) over the next decade.

<TEXT>
   PLANS FOR CHERNOBYL _ The Ukrainian legislature decided this
year that the plant, whose other three reactors are still
functioning, should be closed by 1995. Specialists say shutting it
down may take up to 10 years.
