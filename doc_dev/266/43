   A nuclear-powered Soviet icebreaker came within 40
minutes of a meltdown last fall when an operator mistakenly drained
cooling water from a reactor, according to a Soviet newspaper.
   Vodny Transport, a state-run newspaper that covers shipping, said
the incident occurred Nov. 11 aboard the Rossiya while it was docked
at Murmansk, 1,000 miles north of Moscow in Kola Bay.
   It was there for routine changing of a filter in a reactor, the
newspaper said.
   The reactor was shut down, and cooling water was supposed to be
drained before changing the filter, the newspaper explained. But a
chief physicist aboard the ship gave incorrect instructions to an
operator, who opened a drainage valve on the ship's other reactor,
which was in operation, Vodny Transport said in its Saturday
editions.
   The main supply of cooling water was drained off mistakenly. Just
30 or 40 minutes' worth of backup water was left in a reservoir
before the reactor would have melted down and released radiation,
the newspaper said.
   It took four minutes to bring the problem under control,
according to Dmitri Tarakanov, the newspaper's Murmansk
correspondent. He did not provide details of what action was taken.
   Radiation could have spread from the ship to the city of 440,000
people, Tarakanov indicated.
   Vodny Transport comes out three times a week. There was no
explanation for the four-month delay in reporting the incident.
   A meltdown, the worst possible nuclear accident, occurs when the
reactor core overheats to such a degree that the fuel begins
melting, as happened at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979.
   If the fuel penetrates its protective housing, radioactive
materials are released into the environment.
   The Rossiya was launched from the Baltic Yard in Leningrad in
1983 and went into operation in 1986, according to Jane's Fighting
Ships. It is one of five ships in the Arktika class run by the
Soviet Merchant Marine Ministry.
   Two pressurized water reactors drive the Rossiya's steam turbines
to generate a total 75,000 horsepower, according to Jane's.
   In January, the ship made headlines when it rescued Soviet
researchers stranded on a drifting ice floe north of Greenland.
   On Thursday, the government daily Izvestia quoted a nuclear power
official as saying there have been no accidents aboard the Rossiya
or four other nuclear-powered icebreakers. A. Zhuravkov also said
the reactors on board the ships are a different design from those at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, where a reactor
exploded and caught fire April 26, 1986, killing at least 31 people
and spewing radiation worldwide.
   ``An operator cannot race it to a critical state, as happened at
the Chernobyl atomic power station,'' Zhuravkov told Izvestia.
   The article quoted M. Rabkanov, chief of the Vladivostok port in
the Soviet Far East, as saying safety of nuclear-powered vessels is
``very reliable.''
   Izvestia said people in Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean are
alarmed that a nuclear-powered ship, a sister of the Rossiya called
Sevmorput, was heading their way. Government authorities in another
Far East port, Nakhodka, supported residents' calls to close the
harbor to the Sevmorput.
   There was no indication the people quoted by Izvestia had heard
about the reported incident on the Rossiya.
