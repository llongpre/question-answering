<LEADPARA>  OLGA KORBUT, with a back flip on a balance beam, captured the heart of the
world in the 1972 Olympics.;    Two decades later, Korbut suffers the symptoms
of chronic fatigue similar to those of radiation sickness. To avoid deadly
fallout from the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor five years ago,
she has sent her young son to the United States. She has become an outspoken
crusader for aid to downwind victims of the accident.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Five years ago today, carcinogens poured out of what emigre scientist
Zhores Medvedev described as "a radioactive volcano." The poisons drifted into
Europe and, within 10 days, were detected on the U.S. West Coast.;    Some
scientists argue that as many as 40,000 in the United States alone will die
prematurely because of the meltdown. John Gofman, an expert on radiation
health effects, says that the accident will cause 900,000 cancers, half of
them fatal.;    Within the Soviet Union, more than 2 million people still live
on contaminated ground. There are horror stories of mutated animals, soaring
rates of radiation-related disease and birth defects.;    Tragically, hundreds
of residents, especially the elderly, have refused to evacuate ancestral
homes.;    More tragic, however, is how supporters of nuclear power portray
the disaster. The staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission concedes
that the odds of a major meltdown occurring here in 20 years are 45 in 100.;  
 The horrifying scope of the Chernobyl disaster at least has prompted energy
planners to recalculate the role of atomic power.;    But the worldwide
nuclear power industry, especially in the United States, hears none of it.
American reactor makers have long denied that the Chernobyl plant had a
containment structure, designed to trap the huge quantities of fallout blown
off in a meltdown.;    But in fact the Chernobyl core was surrounded by walls
of steel and concrete, whose strength far exceeded that of at least two dozen
U.S. reactors. The force of the blast shoved the containment aside like paper.
The same could happen here.;    So could the terrifying combination of
mechanical breakdown and operator ignorance and arrogance. Believing
themselves and their technology to be virtually infallible, Soviet reactor
operators took wildly improbable chances with Chernobyl Unit Four. Reactor
builders in all other nuclear nations deny such things could happen again.;   
But a near-Chernobyl struck in Japan last month, and monitoring of the U.S.
industry by the group Critical Mass and other organizations warns that things
here have not substantially improved.;    With a $20 million annual budget,
the U.S. Council on Energy Awareness, a nuclear industry front group, is
attempting to sell a new generation of reactors as the answer to our addiction
to oil. The council's ads fail to mention that just 4.6 percent of the oil we
use goes to generate electricity. Going 100 percent nuclear, which would
require about 500 reactors, would save less than 5 percent of the oil we use,
and would have virtually no impact on imports.;    The ads also fail to
mention that major breakthroughs in solar and wind energy, plus increased
efficiency, have in essence made atomic power obsolete.  </TEXT>
