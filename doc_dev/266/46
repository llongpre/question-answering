   The local Communist Party chief is complaining
that safety standards have eased at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant and well-trained specialists are in short supply at the
facility.
   Grigory I. Revenko, first secretary of the Kiev region, says in
an article in Sunday's Pravda that workers still are searching for
the best way to seal the plant's No. 4 reactor, which exploded and
spewed radiation three years ago last week in the world's worst
nuclear accident.
   After the April 26, 1986 accident, which killed at least 31
people, the reactor was encased in concrete to prevent further
radiation leaks.
   Revenko, a Ukrainian who was recently elected to the new Soviet
parliament, did not say why additional measures were needed to seal
the reactor.
   While that work continues, however, ``Problems with the safe
operation of the station more and more are being moved back to
second priority,'' Revenko wrote in the Communist Party daily.
   ``The understanding of the acuteness of the problems, including
those concerning the safety of the station, has dulled. We consider
this unacceptable and demand decisive intervention by'' the
government, he said.
   Other reactors at the plant are working and reportedly have
generated more than 40 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since
the accident.
   Revenko, 53, said Chernobyl workers either have not received the
equipment and high-quality spare parts they need or have received
them after long delays. He also said scientists and technical
specialists throughout the country are poorly coordinating their
work on eliminating the accident's consequences.
   In addition, he said, the Atomic Energy Ministry is not sending
enough workers capable of coping with the special problems at the
plant.
   The three-column article said it was taking too long to build
housing and other buildings for Chernobyl plant workers in a new
town, Slavutich, and that an off-limits, contaminated zone around
the plant is being poorly managed.
   Recent Soviet news reports have said thousands more people will
be evacuated because their land is contaminated by Chernobyl
radiation and that deformed animals are routinely born on
contaminated Ukrainian farms.
   The reports also have complained that despite the Kremlin's
policy of greater openness, the government recently adopted a rule
forbidding disclosure of the illnesses people suffer from Chernobyl
contamination.
   Soviet public opinion turned against nuclear power after the
accident, and several nuclear power projects have been scrapped
around the country.
