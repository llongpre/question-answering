   A Soviet nuclear submarine that caught fire
last week off Norway leaked small amounts of radiation, and its
reactor may have come close to a meltdown, a Norwegian scientist
said.
   Traces of radioactive Iodine 131 were found in a water sample
taken two days after the June 26 fire aboard the Echo II class
vessel 70 miles off Norway's coast in the Norwegian Sea, state
researchers said Tuesday.
   Knut Gussgard, director of the Norwegian Nuclear Energy Safety
Board, said the submarine apparently ``suffered what is called a
loss of coolant accident, which is what can lead to a meltdown.''
   Gussgard said the radioactive iodine is a byproduct of nuclear
fission, which means the ``core must have leaked coolant, exposing
(uranium) fuel rods that may have burst or even began to melt.''
   Support for the possibility of a meltdown came from Finn
Ugletveit of the Norwegian Radiation Hygiene Institute. ``The
chances that this kind of radiation came from anything but the core
are slim,'' he said.
   Ugletveit, whose institute conducted the radiation tests, said
the radioactive Iodine 131 was ``diluted by seawater and we expect
it to disappear completely very quickly. All other air and water
tests showed no radiation.''
   Tass on Monday said four sailors were hospitalized and were being
examined for possible radiation poisoning. But the news agency said
today that the four ``were healthy and have no excess radiation.''
   Tass quoted Lt. Gen. Igor Sinoplanikov of the Soviet Defense
Ministry as saying a decontamination of the submarine's crew was
carried out June 28, the day the vessel returned to Soviet naval
base at Murmansk. ``This was done to dispel fears of the sailors and
their relatives,'' Sinoplanikov said.
   In a message to the Norwegian government recieved on Friday,
Moscow said the reactor's primary cooling system leaked, but the
system's design guaranteed the security of the reactor, the
Norwegian news agency NTB reported.
   Gussgard said the size of a submarine reactor is about 2 percent
of a power plant such as Chernobyl, which caused an environmental
disaster after a 1986 nuclear accident.
   ``A submarine reactor is so small that we probably wouldn't see
an environmental catastrophe. But if there was a meltdown off
Norway, we might experience radiation levels similar to those that
passed over Norway and Sweden after Chernobyl,'' he said.
   Chernobyl fallout contaminated livestock and fish in parts of
Norway and Sweden, as well as parts of eastern Europe.
   With two accidents in three months among the 100 nuclear
submarines of the Soviet North Fleet Base near Norway, Gussgard said
a major accident no longer seems theoretical.
   On April 7, a Soviet MIKE class nuclear submarine sank off
Norway, killing 42 Soviet sailors.
