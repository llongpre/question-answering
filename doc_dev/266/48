   The area contaminated by the Chernobyl nuclear
accident will be made a sanctuary to study such phenomena as
strangely heavy pine needles and rodents with genetic
abnormalities, the official Tass news agency said today.
   Three regions of Byelorussia that were evacuated after the 1986
accident will be set aside for scientists to observe how radiation
affects plants and wildlife, Tass said. Some sections of the
Ukraine on the other side of Chernobyl are already study areas.
   Tass said pine needles in parts of the poisoned forests remained
normal size but were ten times heavier than normal and that some
conifers had frown into giants.
   Scientists found high radiation levels in reservoirs, and
especially high levels in fish that feed off other fish, including
pike and perch.
   Although some rodents ``developed genetic abnormalities, no
marked changes occurred in their condition and behavior,'' Tass
said.
   Among mammals, wild boars, foxes and rabbits showed the highest
radiation readings, but scientists observed no abnormal behavior
among them, Tass said.
   The explosion and fire at the northern Ukraine nuclear plant's
No. 4 reactor April 26, 1986 killed 31 people and released a cloud
of radioactive material that eventually circled the globe. More
than three years later, the effects continue to be felt.
   Last week Tass reported that 3,000 people are preparing to
evacuate a small section of Russia near the power plant where
radiation has doubled the amount of illness. It did not specify
which illnesses became more common.
   The report followed a dispute between the government and
scientists in Byelorussia about further evacuations. Byelorussian
officials say an extra 11,000 people should be evacuated, but
scientists say some 106,000 should be removed, based on radiation
levels in the area.
   About 130,000 people have already been evacuated from the
vicinity of the plant.
