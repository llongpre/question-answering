THE SOVIET UNION will not abandon the type of nuclear reactor that exploded
at Chernobyl five years ago, but is developing the design for a
second-generation reactor of the same type with western safety features,
including reinforced concrete casing.
It is also planning to rebuild the so-called sarcophagus casing assembled in
haste in 1986 to entomb the stricken reactor, according to Soviet nuclear
executives.
The Soviet experts were addressing a joint conference organised by the
Soviet and French nuclear industry in Paris yesterday on lessons learnt from
the accident.
Building of Chernobyl-type reactors was frozen after the disaster, but a new
building programme of second-generation reactors is now being confidently
forecast.
Mr Nikolay Ponomarev-Stepnoy, from the Kurchatov Institute of Nuclear Energy
in Moscow, said that al-though Chernobyl was a terrible accident that shook
the world, 'without nuclear energy we cannot develop our economy.' It had to
be made 100 per cent safe, however.
Only 16 of the 48 of the Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors are currently
operating in the USSR, running at over 90 per cent capacity and generating
48 per cent of Soviet nuclear electricity.
They now embody several safety-related changes agreed with western nuclear
experts after the initial analysis of the accident in 1986.
These measures - which required no reconstruction - include using a more
highly enriched fuel, more safety rods, and faster and more effective
shutdown systems, including one that responds in only three seconds,
reported Prof Eugeny Adamov from the Kurchatov Institute.
They are still trying to unravel precisely what happened in the accident and
have 13 possible scenarios to explain events.
More details of these scenarios are expected to be revealed by the final
report of the International Atomic Energy Agency on the accident and its
consequences next month.
The Soviet nuclear industry is now focusing on two new features for a
second-generation RBMK, says Professor Adamov. It will have a casing to
prevent release of radioactivity in a serious accident, as the containment
did at the US accident at Three Mile Island in 1978. It will also have a
mechanism for venting steam if several pressure tubes should fail, as may
have happened at Chernobyl.
The industry is also focusing on a better quality of staff for nuclear
operations, with a smaller workload, Prof Adamov said.
A special organisation with about 2,000 staff has been recruited to
safeguard the sarcophagus at Chernobyl, reported Dr Alexander Borovoy,
chairman of the Chernobyl Nuclear Institute.
The sarcophagus contains 180 tonnes of nuclear fuel, including over 400
kilograms of plutonium, and was designed to survive for 20 to 30 years and
to withstand hurricanes and earthquakes.
It is now believed that about 15 tonnes of the fuel is present as a fine
radioactive dust which could leak from the sarcophagus.
There is no immediate danger, Dr Borovoy reported, but there are worries
that it may become a danger again within another 7-10 years. The institute
is studying schemes for enhancing its safety, including one that proposes to
fill the entire tomb with concrete to seal it against radiation leaks.
The institute had virtually agreed on a broad programme of research and
development relating to the sarcophagus and hoped that other nuclear
industries would participate, he said.
