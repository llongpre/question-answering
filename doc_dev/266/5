<HEAD>3,000 to 30,000 Deaths Predicted from Chernobyl Fallout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Robert Gale, an American leukemia
specialist who treated victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant
disaster in the Soviet Union, predicted today that 3,000 to 30,000
people will die of cancer as a result of that accident.
   He also said he expected another major nuclear accident
``somewhere in the world in the next 25 years, maybe in the next 10
years.''
   Gale's forecast was a revision of his prediction a year ago that
there would be as many as 75,000 Chernobyl cancer deaths.
   Last year, British radiologists said they expected that the
delayed effect of the radiation would add about 1,000 deaths to the
estimated 30 million cancer deaths that can be expected to occur in
Western Europe in the next 50 years.
   ``We're predicting at the moment somewhere between 3,000 and
maybe as many as 30,000 extra deaths from cancer over the next 50
years,'' Gale said.
   He was interviewed from Boston on CBS' ``This Morning'' on the
occasion of the second anniversary of Chernobyl and the publication
of his book, ``Final Warning: The Legacy of Chernobyl.''
   Half of the Chernobyl fatalities will occur outside the Soviet
Union, mostly in Eastern and Western Europe, Gale said.
   ``When you have an accident in one of these power plants, it's
an international event,'' he said. ``And, it's always going to
happen that at least half of the events are going to occur outside
of the country of the accident. We're all in this together in a
nuclear age.''
