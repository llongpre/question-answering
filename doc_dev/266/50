<HEAD>Dutch Woman Hospitalized After Four-Year Chernobyl `Phobia'</HEAD>

   A 24-year-old woman has been
hospitalized after years of living under a plastic sheet and eating
only canned food out of fear of radiation from the Chernobyl
nuclear accident, police said Saturday.
   The woman spent at least two years wrapped in the sheet and left
her couch in the family home only to go to the bathroom, according
to National Police spokesman Arie van Turnhout.
   The Dutch woman was hospitalized last month with an inflamed
bladder after her parents contacted a doctor, said Van Turhout. He
said police began an investigation into the case only last week
after hearing of the case on the ``village grapevine.''
   The woman, who was not identified, suffered from severe
malnutrition and cramped joints, Van Turnhout said.
   An investigation found out the woman hadn't washed and had
refused to eat anything but canned goods since the April 30, 1986,
explosion of the Soviet nuclear power plant, Van Turnhout told The
Associated Press.
   Her parents had been told to humor their daughter until her fear
of being contaminated subsided, he said, but did not disclose who
gave the advice.
   ``It's just a miserable psychosocial case,'' he said, adding the
entire family from this southwestern Dutch village would be
undergoing therapy.
   Shortly after the Chernobyl accident, the Dutch government
briefly banned the sale of spinach and ordered the stabling of all
Dutch cattle as the cloud of radioactive fallout swept west from
the Soviet Ukraine.
   There were similar measures in several Western European
countries.
   According to official Soviet figures, 31 people were killed in
the explosion and fire, although a Soviet newspaper has speculated
the death toll could be as high as 250.
