   Some leading scientists think the Soviet
Union's Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded like a nuclear bomb,
something the nuclear industry has said could not happen.
   In an article in today's Technology Review, scientists gave
conflicting views on whether the April 1986 Chernobyl accident,
which killed 31 people and spread radiation thousands of miles, was
caused by a nuclear explosion.
   The article in the journal, published by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said similar accidents could happen at 13
other reactors in the Soviet Union, but ``the possibility of such an
accident in a U.S. reactor is vanishingly small.''
   William Sweet, the article's author, interviewed scientists and
specialists at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department
of Energy in an effort to reach a consensus on the accident.
   ``A runaway nuclear reaction set off a chain of events that
severely damaged the reactor core and surrounding structures,''
Sweet wrote. ``This damage set the stage for a second explosion
which was much more violent than the first and almost certainly was
a full-fledged nuclear explosion.''
   But Themis Speis, deputy research chief at the NRC, said it was
``very misleading'' to call the accident a nuclear explosion.
   ``The reactor went out of control, but the time it took to raise
the temperature and pressure is many orders of magnitude smaller
than it takes to get an atomic bomb going,'' he said.
   John Ahearne, former NRC chairman, said, ``I wouldn't call it a
nuclear explosion.''
   But Harvard University physics professor Richard Wilson said,
``It was a nuclear explosion; there's no doubt, because the ultimate
source of energy was nuclear.''
   The argument is one of semantics, said Gregory Van Tuyle, a
nuclear engineer at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
   The plant was not destroyed by a steam explosion as scientists
had believed, but ``power grew to very large levels very rapidly,''
he said. ``The phrase `nuclear explosion' is not inappropriate.''
   Sweet said the reaction at Chernobyl was unlike a bomb in that it
gave off less energy and produced it more slowly than a bomb.
   But reports suggest the reactor's fuel formed a critical mass,
reacted uncontrollably, melted and vaporized, he said.
   It ``would be deeply misleading to say that the plant did not
blow up like an atomic bomb,'' he said.
   ``Ever since the first nuclear power plants were built in the
1950s, the industry has insisted they can't explode like bombs,''
Sweet said. ``Chernobyl casts doubt on whether that is true of all
power reactors.''
   Sweet is a reporter at Physics Today, which is published by the
American Institute of Physics.
