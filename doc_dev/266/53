  [Text] Vienna, April 21 (AFP) -- Ukraine Thursday [21 
April] ruled out the immediate closure of the Chernobyl nuclear 
power station despite safety fears, at the start of an 
international conference on the eighth anniversary of the 
world's biggest nuclear accident. 
  "There are no plans for the immediate closure of the two 
units" still functioning at Chernobyl, Urainian Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov said, according to a spokesman of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which is hosting the 
two-day meeting in the Austrian capital. 
  This could happen only "when new stations have come on 
stream 
and when the efficiency of conventional stations has been 
improved" and this needed "money and some years," spokesman 
David Kyd quoted him as saying. 
  The IAEA has declared one of the units unsafe to operate and 
the United States has demanded the plant's closure. 
  Ukraine is currently building eight new VVER 1,000-watt 
nuclear stations, of the same design as Chernobyl, which are 
expected to be in operation between 1994 and 1999. 
  The meeting, including experts from 16 countries and 
representatives from the European Union and European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), was called after a report 
by IAEA experts complained about security standards. 
  Fears were compounded further this week when two minor 
accidents took place within two days at the plant, north of the 
Ukrainian capital Kiev. 
  Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear 
accident on April 23, 1986, when the number four reactor 
exploded, releasing a huge radioactive cloud. 
  Last year there were 36 incidents there, four of which led 
to 
a reactor being shut down. Twenty of the incidents caused a 
reduction in power. 
  In 1990, the Ukrainian parliament decided it would close 
down 
Chernobyl for good at the end of 1993, but in October 1993 
deputies voted to keep the plant open in order to reduce 
dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
  On Thursday, Shmarov judged the level of risk to be 
"acceptable" and said the two units produced the equivalent of 
4.7 million tonnes of oil per year, about seven percent of the 
country's total energy production. 
  At the EBRD's annual congress in Saint Petersburg Tuesday, 
Ukrainian Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko called for a 
special fund to be set up to finance the shutdown of Chernobyl 
and asked that some money from an existing fund be used to 
improve security at the plant. 
  The IAEA's director general Hans Blix said Thursday's 
conference aimed to give a full picture of the situation at 
Chernobyl and Ukraine's energy needs. The Agency also hoped to 
identify when the plant was no longer vital to the Ukrainian 
economy and help identity constructive options. 
  The IAEA is worried about standards in the face of an exodus 
of 20 percent of all qualified staff. "A taxi driver in Kiev 
earns more than a qualified worker at Chernobyl," said Kyd. 
  Repair work recommended by the Agency has not been carried 
out and fire protection standards are low, it says. 
  The concrete casing around reactor four, scene of the 1986 
accident, is also seriously damaged, threatening neighbouring 
reactors and posing the danger of radioactive leaks.
