   Doctors believe the leukemia that has
hospitalized Czechoslovakia's ambassador might have been caused by
radioactive fallout from the 1986 Soviet nuclear accident at
Chernobyl, a Czech embassy official says.
   Ambassador Rita Klimova, 59, is in Johns Hopkins Hospital in
nearby Baltimore, where she faces perhaps four weeks of
chemotherapy treatment, the Czechoslovak Embassy said Friday.
   The ambassador's son, Vladimir Mlynar, visiting her from Prague,
said his mother ``feels quite good,'' and said she is ``slightly
optimistic,'' according to Embassy official Laco Mravec.
   Mrs. Klimova's leukemia, cancer of the white blood cells, was
diagnosed earlier this month at Walter Reed U.S. Army Medical
Center in Washington, where President Bush's physician arranged for
her to be examined, said Miroslav Chrobok, embassy charge
d'affaires.
   ``Two doctors at Walter Reed suggested it might be one of those
funny cases of leukemia we have in Eastern Europe ... it might be a
Chernobyl thing,'' Chrobok said.
   He said the Army doctors told him they meant cases of the
sometimes-fatal blood disease that have appeared with no apparent
cause of leukemia except exposure to air or water contaminated by
radiation over a wide region of Europe and Scandinavia after the
April 1986 nuclear power plant explosion at the Ukrainian city of
Chernobyl.
   ``Certainly there is nothing certain'' about the cause, ``it's
just a possibility,'' Chrobok said.
   At least 31 people perished during and after the Chernobyl
explosion and thousands were evacuated from the area of heaviest
contamination. Since then, numerous cases of blood-related
illnesses around Europe have been attributed to Chernobyl and
officials are urging a wider evacuation.
   Dr. Robert Gale, the Los Angeles physician who treated some of
Chernobyl's worst radiation cases, has said Chernobyl fallout could
increase cancer deaths by as many as 30,000 worldwide in the next
half century. Chrobok said Gale is among numerous well-wishers who
have messaged the ambassador, and has offered to assist on her case.
   Dr. Klimova, a newcomer to diplomacy, arrived in Washington last
February as her country's first new envoy to the United States
after the peaceful revolution that ended 40 years of Communist rule
last December.
