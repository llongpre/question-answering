The Soviet Union has canceled plans to construct two more reactors at the 
stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station and has halted expansion of all 
similar plants for safety reasons, the Tass news agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced six days before the third anniversary of the 
accident at Chernobyl, 60 miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine, that killed 31 
people in the world's worst civilian nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to construct two additional reactors at the facility had been suspended 
since the explosion of the No. 4 reactor spread a cloud of radiation over 
Eastern Europe on April 26, 1986. The No. 4 reactor is now sealed in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Addition of No. 5 and No. 6 reactors to the three-reactor plant would have made 
it the biggest atomic energy station in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Council of Ministers has adopted an unequivocal decision to abandon the 
construction of the fifth and sixth power blocks of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station on which work had been suspended after the Chernobyl accident," Tass 
said. "In addition, no plans will be made to expand other power stations now in 
operation that use the RBMK (graphite) reactors. Unlike Western reactors, the 
graphite RBMKs can be refueled without being shut down for months at a time." 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the other stations are at Kursk, in central Russia, and near 
the western city of Smolensk. 
</P>
<P>
The graphite system is inexpensive and simple because the reactor is made of 
piles of graphite blocks with interconnecting water-cooling pipes. It is hard 
to maintain, however, because the hundreds of thousands of pipe connections 
could develop leaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has 45 nuclear reactors in operation at 16 locations, and 
another 34 plants are under construction at 15 locations, according to official 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to rebuild power blocks that were constructed in the 
1970s and are now operating, Tass said. The reconstruction will take place 
between 1989 and 1994, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"These and all the newly constructed power blocks will be equipped with 
additional safety systems, which ensure safe cooling in case of an emergency," 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The new systems will allow inspectors to contain any radioactive leaks from the 
reactor complex, Tass said. Soviet engineers will have designs by the mid-1990s 
for a new generation of power stations.
