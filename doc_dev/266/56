   The government on Wednesday lifted a
ban on fishing in Lake Lugano, the last health measure still in
force after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   Recent tests showed radioactivity in fish in the southern lake
had dropped to a safe level, the Swiss Interior Ministry said.
   Fishing, banned since September 1986, will be allowed starting
July 9.
   Levels of radioactive cesium in the fish were nearly 100 times
the current level after the disaster at the nuclear plant in the
Soviet Union, the ministry said.
   About 70 professional fishers on Lake Lugano will receive
government compensation for income lost during the ban.
   The Chernobyl accident showered Western Europe with a
radioactive cloud, prompting health measures in many countries.
