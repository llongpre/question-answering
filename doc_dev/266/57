<LEADPARA>  Scientists here say they have found widespread degradation of the health of
thousands of people living in areas contaminated by fallout from the fire five
years ago at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.;   "The medical and biological
consequences of Chernobyl appear much more serious and diverse than had been
expected during the first years," said Dr. Tamara V. Belookaya, head of
diagnostics at the Institute of Radiation Medicine in Aksakovshchina, a town
in the Minsk metropolitan area.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Radiation, heavy metals, chemical pollution, inadequate nutrition and
psychological stress have caused essential changes in the health status of the
Byelorussian population," Belookaya said in a new publication that catalogs
Soviet scientific literature on the aftermath of the April 26, 1986, nuclear
disaster.;   Doctors say the health of thousands of people in Byelorussia, a
Kansas-size republic of 10 million people between the Russian republic and
Poland, is undermined by anemia, gastritis, tuberculosis and susceptibility to
infections.;   Western experts divided;   But Western radiation experts are
divided over the reports of degraded health.;   Some describe them as a result
of psychological stress stemming from the nuclear accident or say that poor
Soviet record-keeping invalidated before-and-after health comparisons.;  
Others say the phenomenon recalls "atom bomb sickness" experienced by
Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors in the 1950s, including weakened immune
systems and heightened susceptibilities to infection.;   Thyroid cancer among
Byelorussian children, for instance, jumped from eight cases in 1989 to 42 in
1990. By last September, 50 cases had been detected in the republic, Belookaya
said.;   2 million live in tainted area;   Two million people in Byelorussia,
including 800,000 children, still live in areas affected by contamination,
according to Lidiya Litvinovich, head physician of the Byelorussian Children
Fund, a government agency.;   Some Western experts worry that officials in the
newly assertive republics have a vested interest in exaggerating Chernobyl's
damage: They want to win more foreign medical aid, and greater reparations
from any future financial liquidation of the Soviet state.;   "I don't know of
any radiation-caused illnesses in the area," said Dr. Marvin Goldman, a
professor of radiation biology at the University of California, Davis who
since 1988 has directed a U.S.-Soviet program on health effects of civilian
nuclear power plant operation. He said the one real medical effect was the
stress caused by the accident.;   Goldman took part in an International Atomic
Energy Agency study that concluded last May that in the villages studied,
there were "no health disorders that could be attributed directly to
radiation.";   But critics here say the study was bound to give Byelorussia a
clean bill of health because it did not study the estimated 600,000 cleanup
workers and did not study the 200,000 people evacuated, largely from a 19-mile
radius around Chernobyl.  </TEXT>
