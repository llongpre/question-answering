   Authorities badly underestimated the health
problems the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster would cause, with
reported cancer cases doubling in a region near the stricken plant
that was not evacuated, Moscow News reported.
   The article Wednesday in the weekly newspaper said calves are
born routinely without heads and limbs in the radiation-contaminated
area of the Soviet Ukraine.
   It said more than half the children of the Narodichsky region _
an agriculturally rich area within 30 miles of the plant _ have
thyroid gland illnesses, which can be caused by exposure to
radiation.
   The newspaper's correspondent, Vladimir Kolinko, said one woman,
who cares for pigs at a tainted farm, asked, ``My daughter recently
got married. What kind of grandson will I have?''
   In all, 31 people died in the immediate aftermath of the
explosion and fire at the plant on April 26, 1986.
   The disaster sent a cloud of radiation around the world.
   Moscow News reported that elevated levels of radioactive
cesium-137 were detected among many residents of the Narodichsky
region, which was not evacuated after the accident.
   It said, ``Health officials of the republic insist there is no
health danger for people outside a 19-mile zone around the atomic
power station.''
   Since the accident, Soviet officials stressed time and again that
radiation levels were safe in all but the immediate area surrounding
the plant. They generally discounted warnings from some Western
doctors that cases of cancer and other diseases would soar.
   The Moscow News article, however, was the second this month in
the Soviet press to suggest health problems from the accident were
mounting.
   The official Tass news agency reported Feb. 9 that cancer and
other diseases are on the rise in Byelorussia, the republic
neighboring the Ukraine that also was contaminated by Chernobyl.
Tass said authorities had just determined that one-fifth of
Byelorussia is contaminated.
   Moscow News said lip, mouth and other cancers doubled among
Narodichsky region residents since the accident.
   Kolinko said residents had a right to be outraged.
   He wrote that if the government is serious about its pledges,
residents ``would have the right to demand _ to demand and not ask _
for full compensation ... not to mention the right to full
information about people's health and the condition of the land.''
   At the Petrovsky animal farm, the newspaper said, veterinarian
Peter Kudin reported that during the five years before Chernobyl,
three cases of birth defects occurred among pigs and there were no
abnormal calves.
   In the year after the disaster, 37 pigs and 27 calves had birth
defects, he said. In the first nine months of 1988, 41 pigs and 35
calves were born with abnormalities _ ``the calves frequently
without heads, limbs, eyes or ribs, the pigs goggle-eyed or with
deformed skulls.''
   The animals had been feeding on fields where wind had blown
radioactive particles, the newspaper said.
   It said that uncontaminated meat and dairy products are brought
in for residents, but some people ignore doctors' warnings and drink
milk from local cows and pick fruit and vegetables from their garden
plots.
