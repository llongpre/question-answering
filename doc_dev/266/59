   After years of state-encouraged passivity, Soviets
today marked the fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear plant
disaster with widespread protests, a 24-hour telethon and a strike
at a major factory.
   It was the biggest national commemoration yet of the 1986
tragedy, the world's worst nuclear power acccident.
   ``We have been silent too long,'' said a reporter on the TV news
program Vremya, which focused its afternoon show on Chernobyl
reports.
   Officially, 31 people were killed when one of four reactors at
Chernobyl caught fire and exploded on April 26, 1986, about 90
miles north of Kiev in the Soviet Ukraine. Unofficial reports say
at least 250 died.
   The blast spewed radioactive cesium, strontium and plutonium
isotopes across much of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia and
sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world.
   For the first two days after the accident, the Soviet Union
refused to report it to the outside world and withheld information
from its own people. Only last year did officials admit the full
scope of the contamination and decide to resettle 100,000 more
people.
   The official willingness to play up the Chernobyl anniversary
today appeared to reflect both the growing awareness of the
catastrophe's aftermath and the pro-democracy views of many newly
elected local governing councils.
   Residents in the southwestern Soviet regions most contaminated
by the blast organized protests to demand better medical treatment,
protection from radiation and punishment for the officials who
covered up the accident's effects, activists said.
   In the Byelorussian city of Gomel, most of the 35,000 workers of
the GomselMash industrial complex walked out on a daylong strike,
said Alexander Korniev, a plant worker.
   Strikers were demanding better medical care and wanted all
officials who participated in the cover-up brought to trial, he
said.
   The Chernobyl Telethon, one of the Soviet Union's first
experiences with television fundraising, collected $38 million,
organizers announced.
   The live broadcast, originating in Moscow, interspersed singing
groups and interviews with tragic footage showing Chernobyl
rescuers and children in the contaminated zone suffering from
radiation-caused cancers. Along with money, pledges to the telethon
center included donations of radiation-free fruit and even 1,100
pounds of honey for children in the contaminated area.
   CNN showed live scenes of the telethon to American viewers. Many
of the donations came from the United States, Japan and Western
Europe, the Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The Ukrainian legislature declared today ``Chernobyl Tragedy
Day'' and its Byelorussian counterpart passed a similar measure.
Other government bodies in the affected areas sanctioned widespread
demonstrations.
   On the eve of the anniversary, the Soviet legislature adopted a
$26 billion program that would involve resettling an additional
200,000 people from irradiated areas.
   The program was adopted Wednesday even though many members of
the legislature, the Supreme Soviet, criticized it as inadequate to
deal with the health, agricultural, economic and environmental
aftermath of the accident.
   After a day of debate, including charges of an official cover-up
of the disaster and bungled evacuations, legislators endorsed a
program for dealing with Chernobyl from 1990-1992, Tass reported.
   About 180,000 to 200,000 people still living in contaminated
areas four years after the accident are to be resettled.
   In the months after the accident, 116,000 people were evacuated,
and some Soviet scientists and politicians have been campaigning
since then for further resettlements. They say 4 million Soviets
are living on contaminated land.
   The $26 billion is a major increase in spending on the Chernobyl
aftermath. It is twice the level spent in the four years since the
accident but still short of the $405 billion legislator Yuri
Scherback has estimated is needed over the next 10 years.
   Many Chernobyl-area residents have complained of inadequate
medical care and cases of anemia, leukemia and cancers have been
reported rising among people living on irradiated land. Many
residents still eat irradiated food because alternatives are not
available.
   Dealing with the larger questions posed by Chernobyl, the
Supreme Soviet directed the government to draft a bill on the use
of nuclear energy and nuclear safety, and to phase out the
Chernobyl power plant.
   The three reactors not involved in the accident are still
operating. The Ukrainian legislature wants the plant closed by 1995.
   Several other nuclear power projects around the country were
canceled because of the heightened safety concerns generated by the
Chernobyl accident.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said in an interview published
today that the Soviet Union will not phase out nuclear energy
altogether, but it will improve safety systems.
