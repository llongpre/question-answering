   Last year's Chernobyl nuclear accident was less harmful to the average Soviet citizen than previously estimated, suggested new radiation studies released by Soviet officials. 

   The studies, described at an international conference here of nuclear-power specialists, indicated the accident's fallout gave the Soviet population a radiation dose of less than half of Moscow's earlier estimates. 
The new estimate still ranks Chernobyl as the most harmful accident in the history of nuclear power. 
But if correct, the dose lowers the potential toll of radiation-induced cancers in the western Soviet Union by more than half-to about 4,000 over the next 50 years. 

   Leonid Illyin, director of the Biophysics Institute of the Soviet public health ministry, presented the results. 
At a news conference, Dr. Illyin castigated "malicious people" in the West who have forecast as many as one million Chernobyl-related deaths. 
In fact, he said, "the expected number of extra cancers (in the Soviet Union) will be hundredths of 1%" of the normal cancer rate. 
Dr. Illyin is Russia's top expert on Chernobyl health effects. 

   The new Soviet figures contradict previous Western estimates of Chernobyl-related cancer deaths. 
For instance, a U.S. Department of Energy study last June estimated that 11,000 people in the western Soviet Union may develop fatal cancers because of fallout -- in addition to the 9.4 million expected cancer deaths. 

   Because the fallout spread outside the Soviet Union, the U.S. agency projected as many as 28,000 Chernobyl-related cancer deaths in the Northern Hemisphere. 
That would represent an increase in the world cancer rate of a fraction of 1%. 
These deaths would occur over the next few decades. 
So far, 31 people -- all Chernobyl plant workers or firefighters -- have died. 

   Western nuclear experts at the conference yesterday said they may have to revise their cancer forecasts because they are partly based on the earlier Soviet dosage estimates. 
None of the Western delegates immediately challenged the new figures. 

   The revised estimates dovetailed with the general message Soviet officials and scientists presented yesterday: Chernobyl, while a horrible accident, wasn't quite as bad as the West initially painted it. 

   Soviet delegates said they based the new dosage estimates on extensive radiation measurements of people, plants and animals. 
Their previous dosage figures, released a few months after the April 1986 accident, had been based on fewer measurements and on theoretical models that apparently overestimated the amount of radioactive caesium absorbed by people.
