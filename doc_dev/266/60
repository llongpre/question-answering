<LEADPARA>  THE RALLY this week in Washington is called "No More Chernobyls!" It's in the
wrong place. The United States has no Chernobyls. The Soviets are still
running 15 of them. Since the accident, they have stopped construction on all
new ones of that type and have agonized about closing several of them.;    Why
agonize? Because they do not have enough electric power to supply what their
people and industries need. Their economy is in bad shape, and further cuts in
electric power supply would bring chaos. All it takes is a look at Kuwait, or
at the condition of cities in Iraq, to realize that once electric power has
been available, people cannot go back to doing without it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Five years ago, the operators of Chernobyl did not know that Western
engineers had reviewed its design and rejected it because of potential safety
problems: The same problems that caused the disaster. They did not know what
nuclear plant operators in free nations had learned from Three Mile Island.;  
 While the plant was different, and TMI could not have the kind of accident
that destroyed Chernobyl, the lessons learned about sharing operating
experience, analyzing every incident both large and small, pre-approved
procedures for every test and communicating with management and staff, were
fully applicable to them.;    The basic safety philosophy is different too. We
assume Murphy's Law works. We design assuming that all parts and systems may
fail and that people will make mistakes. The Soviets chose the few accidents
they wanted to design against. They were not enough.;    The TMI lessons were
not learned because the Soviet leaders were afraid to tell their operators
about TMI. They were afraid the stories would get to the public and threaten
their faith in the safety of Soviet reactors. How shortsighted. Now they have
joined the World Association of Nuclear Operators, and are learning about
communication.;    The accident spread radioactive contamination over the
Ukraine, Europe and Scandinavia. There were traces of radiation detected
around the globe, but at levels so low that only sensitive instruments
detected differences from the natural levels of background radiation. But that
will not stop those at the rallies from proclaiming that tens of thousands of
cases of cancer will occur because of Chernobyl.;    Radiation biologists
assume that any amount of radiation, no matter how tiny, contributes to
cancer. So when 10 million people receive an additional amount of radiation
equivalent to spending an hour outdoors under the sunny sky, those 10 million
tiny doses are added up, and the statisticians predict one cancer. But of
those 10 million people, 2 million will die of cancer anyway. The additional
one cancer is not real, but a statistical formula. Living organisms absorb
this radiation all the time. Cells rebuild. This level of radiation is not a
threat to humanity.;    One activist said that "half a million people were
exposed to life-shortening doses of radiation." A microsecond in return for an
hour in the sunshine? By using the scary term "life-shortening," a political
message is being sent.;    The actual threat is that irrational fear of a
sound technology will keep the United States from building nuclear power
plants.  </TEXT>
