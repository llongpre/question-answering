Accident"] 
  [Text] Chernobyl/Kiev--"The zone"--it is only spoken of 
that way by those in the know--that restricted area 30 
kilometers in diameter around the power plant, has become a huge 
testing and research area. Six and one-half years after the 
explosion and the fire at the nuclear power plant--which began 
on 26 April 1986--the effects are being observed on people, 
animals, and plants. For researchers it has become a mecca. Here 
they hope to find answers to what man-made radioactivity does to 
the environment and those of us who live with the environment. 
  It is important to learn this, not just for the Ukrainians, 
but also for other countries with nuclear power and for 
countries without nuclear power. Because contamination knows no 
borders. The zone is uninhabited; 163,000 people were evacuated 
from the region. But beyond the zone people live. People live in 
Valdres in Norway, where there are places that are just as 
contaminated with radioactive materials as the soil and the 
woods in the vicinity of Chernobyl. 
<H5>  Berlin Blue </H5>
  The effects of this contamination could have been very 
great, 
in economic and health terms, if it had not been for Berlin blue. 
  "It might sound like boasting, but the fact is that the 
Norwegian initiative with Berlin blue is almost the only 
successful research project in Chernobyl, in Ukraine, in 
Belarus, and, not least of all, here in Norway," said Per 
Strand, a researcher at the Norwegian Radiation Protection 
Agency. Since 1990, and together with Brit Salbu and Knut Hove, 
professors at the University of Trondheim's College of Arts and 
Sciences [NLH], he has been working with Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Russia on the fallout from Chernobyl. 
  The pigment, which was first produced in Berlin in 1704, 
hence the name, contains a complex iron ion (FeIIFeII-(Cn)6) 
which has proven effective as a binder for radioactive cesium, 
Cs137. The first research on Berlin blue was carried out at the 
Radium Hospital in the sixties; later a method was developed 
using Berlin blue as an additive to blocks of salt lick and as a 
pre-additive. This was done at the Norwegian Agricultural 
College, which in 1991 tested tablets in Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Russia--with fairly remarkable results. 
  Berlin blue works in such a way that radioactive materials 
are not absorbed into the body or turn up in meat and milk. An 
absorption reduction of some 90 percent means that large 
contaminated areas can still be used by people and animals. 
  How important this is in economic and health terms can be 
illustrated by the following figures: 
  In Ukraine, more than 7 million hectares of ground have been 
contaminated by Cesium 137, so the radioactivity is over 1 curie 
per square kilometer (calculated another way: 37,000 becquerels 
per square meter). Today 2.6 million people live in this area. 
Between 1986 and 1991, Ukraine spent over 15 billion karbovanets 
to neutralize and reduce the effects of the fallout. Even if 
inflation is high and Ukraine's currency is still dropping in 
value, this is nevertheless a very major burden. 
  In addition, there are huge areas in Belarus, especially 
around Gomel. And areas in Norway. Norway is in fact the country 
outside the former Soviet Union that was the most affected, and 
will continue to be the most affected, by the fallout from 
Chernobyl. In Valdres, there are many areas where the 
contamination varies between 1 and 10 curies per square 
kilometer. 
  Norway is also especially vulnerable because we use 
wilderness areas for grazing to such an extent. A survey done by 
the NHL and the Radiation Protection Agency in Ukraine showed 
that on land that is farmed, plowed, and fertilized, the 
absorption of radioactive materials in plants is less. The type 
of soil is also important; the contamination of organic soil 
(soil rich in humus) is the worst; radioactive particles are 
more permanent in clayey soil. 
<H5>  Get By Cheaply </H5>
  By simply giving Berlin blue to domestic animals, absorption 
in meat and milk can thus be neutralized. The economic 
consequences are great. In Belarus alone, they would have to 
spend between 5 and 10 percent of the [gross] national product 
to neutralize the contamination; now they can get by with much 
less. 
  We are also doing that. If we had followed the international 
standards for the absorption of radioactive materials and not 
used any countermeasures, Norwegian agriculture would have lost 
between 1 and 2 billion kroner annually. Using Berlin blue, the 
radiation values are brought way down. Cost: around 100 million 
kroner. 
  The Norwegian research applies not just to reductions of 
absorption in animals. It also includes a project in which the 
aim is to study the mobility of radioactive materials in 
relation to the distance from a nuclear power plant where there 
have been emissions. The goal of this research is to learn more 
about what Norway could be exposed to if, for example, an 
accident were to occur at the Russian nuclear power plant on the 
Kola [Peninsula]. 
<H5>  Eight Thousand Dead From Radiation </H5>
  "We have seen many tears," said Vladimir Kholosha, the 
deputy 
minister at the Chernobyl ministry. "Tears because people had to 
leave their homes, tears because people died from minor 
illnesses. People's immune systems were so weakened by radiation 
that even `innocuous' diseases have become life-threatening." 
  Today there is hardly anyone who has an overview of what 
effect the radiation from Chernobyl has had on public health. 
Kholosha confirmed that about 8,000 people have died, and that 
it was due to large doses of radioactivity. In early September, 
the Ukranian national assembly, Verhovna Rada, approved a 
comprehensive program for the next two years and the period 
between now and the year 2000 to reduce the effects. But money 
is needed--scads of money--and Ukraine does not have it. 
  At the same time a major effort is under way, under the 
aegis, among others, of the UN and the EC, to survey public 
health conditions. A good six and one-half years after the 
accident, we are starting to see some of the consequences. In 
Ukraine and Belarus, infantile thyroid gland cancer has 
increased dramatically, a survey conducted by the World Health 
Organization, WHO, showed. Since 1989, 225 new cases have been 
reported in Belarus, 157 in Ukraine. Normally there would only 
have been two to three cases. 
  Ukrainian experts also think they are seeing more deaths 
from 
other diseases, among others of the heart, blood vessels, and 
the circulatory system, but inasmuch as there are so many 
factors that influence the development of such diseases, at the 
moment it is too early to suggest any connection. 
Regardless--the national assembly, Verhovna Rada, certainly 
stands by what it said when it states that the Chernobyl 
accident "will be seen as the worst tragedy in 20th century 
Ukrainian history, and will affect the lives of several 
generations of people." 
<H5>  Strange Evergreen Forest </H5>
  The needles on the fir trees do not look like ordinary 
needles--even if they come from the common fir, pinus 
silvestris. They are in different sizes. Some are long, others 
are short, some are growing in loops. From every growth point, 
where normally five branches would grow, here between six and 20 
grow. All the same, upon closer inspection, this green forest is 
not that normal. 
  "We can see changes in the pattern of growth," said Andrei 
Arkhipov, one of the researchers at the center in Pripyat. "But 
it is impossible to see whether there are genetic changes; for 
that, we have to have several generations of trees. The green 
forest of firs was sown with seeds from those trees that 
received the greatest radiation damage in 1986, and turned red." 
  Arkhipov is the son of Prof. Nikolai Archipov, one of 
Russia's greatest experts on the effects of radioactive 
contamination. For many years the elder Arkhipov conducted 
studies of the effects of the once unknown nuclear accident in 
Kyshtym in the Urals. Now the laboratory has been moved to 
Chernobyl. 
  The forest is just one of the research areas. In large 
greenhouses tests have been made on plants such as rape, lupine, 
oats, root crops, and vegetables to study the absorption of 
radioactive materials in the plants--and how this can be 
neutralized. 
  "The most effective countermeasure we have found to date is 
fertilization with potassium, which prevents the absorption of 
cesium. Applying lime is useful to reduce the absorption of 
strontium," Arkhipov said. The center has extensively mapped the 
contaminated area, which shows a spotty pattern. In some places 
the fallout can be great, just as it can be practically free of 
radioactive materials. The main goal of this research is to see 
how agricultural areas can be reused after a nuclear accident.
