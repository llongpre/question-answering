   More than 250 people who worked at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant during the 1986 accident or helped clean up
after it have died, a newspaper reported today.
   The toll reported by the weekly Moscow News was far higher than
the official toll of 31 killed in the April 26, 1986, explosion and
fire at the plant in the Soviet Ukraine.
   A spokesman for the government agency that is responsible for the
Chernobyl cleanup acknowledged the figure of 250 dead but said only
the 31 could be traced directly to the disaster, the world's worst
atomic accident.
   ``More than 250 people of those who were at work at the time of
the explosion or worked on liquidating the consequences of the 20th
century's greatest accident, have already died,'' Moscow News said.
   It said they died of various illnesses, and that no one can tell
what the full human cost of the disaster will be.
   The article, on a new association of those concerned about the
accident, did not say what the source of the figure was or provide
any more details of it.
   The government newspaper Izvestia also printed a report on the
association, which calls itself simply ``Chernobyl,'' but it did not
use such a figure.
   However, it did say that ``many of those who worked for a long
time in conditions that were dangerous for their health, need help
today.''
   Alexander Karasyuk, an engineer and spokesman for the Kombinat
organization that is handling the cleanup said in a telephone
interview from Kiev: ``We can't say that those 250 died directly
from illnesses caused by radiation.''
   Karasyuk said he is a member of the Chernobyl association.
   The register of the dead included some people who died of
illnesses from which they suffered even before an explosion and fire
ripped through Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor. More scientific study was
needed, he said.
   Further information on the figures could not be obtained
immediately. Most offices in the Soviet Union were closed because
today was taken as a holiday after the celebration of the 72nd
anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
   The figure of 31 dead, which officials have used as the death
toll since just months after the accident, includes 28 people who
died of radiation sickness, two who died of burns and one who had a
heart attack trying to put out the fire, Karasyuk said.
   Officials say they give regular medical check-ups to thousands of
people who were exposed to radiation in the accident. A radiation
center in Kiev, about 80 miles south of the power plant, has files
on about 600,000 people, the Kombinat spokesman said.
   After the accident, which released a cloud of radioactive
material that circled the world, Soviet officials evacuated
thousands of people in an 18-mile zone around the plant.
   The Chernobyl accident already has cost the Soviet Union billions
of dollars, and spawned a strong anti-nuclear movement. A report in
March said almost a quarter-million people still were living on land
so contaminated that they cannot eat food grown on it, and three
years after the accident officials still are evacuating more people
from the area surrounding the plant.
