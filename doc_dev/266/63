   Doctors summoned to a recent radiation accident in Brazil reported a potentially significant advance in treating radiation sickness, using a genetically engineered drug. 

   The doctors said the drug they administered appeared to help boost the radiation-damaged immune systems of some Brazilian patients, and said it should be given "without delay" to future nuclear-accident victims. 

   Their report, to be published here Saturday in the Lancet, a leading British medical journal, immediately was attacked by some radiation specialists as too optimistic. 
But both sides in the scientific debate called the new treatment a promising development in treating radiation sickness. 

   The drug, given to eight Brazilian radiation victims last year, is called granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, or GM-CSF. 
Supplied by biotechnology concerns Immunex Corp. of Seattle and Behringwerke AG of West Germany, the drug is a genetically engineered version of a natural human protein that stimulates production in the bone-marrow of an important type of white blood cell, granulocyte. 
Such cells help fight disease, and their wholesale destruction by heavy radiation doses is generally fatal. 

   Since the birth of the atomic age, doctors have been looking for ways to treat acute radiation sickness. 
Most commonly, they give antibiotics and blood transfusions to protect defenseless radiation patients against fatal infections. 
After the April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, Soviet and American doctors tried transplanting fresh bone marrow to some patients to help repair radiation-damaged immune systems. 
All but one of the transplant patients died, and the treatment fell out of favor with many radiation specialists. 

   At the Brazilian accident, doctors decided to try GM-CSF. 
The accident began Sept. 13, 1987, when villagers in Goiania, Brazil, stumbled on some radiotherapy equipment abandoned by a former health clinic there. 
In all, 249 people were contaminated by radioactive cesium from the equipment. 
Twenty people were hospitalized with radiation injuries, and four died. 

   The doctors involved in the treatment included a team at Rio de Janeiro's Hospital Marcilio Dias, and Dr. Robert Gale, a controversial professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. 
Dr. Gale briefly became a media star in 1986 by flying to Moscow to perform the post-Chernobyl marrow transplants. 

   Even before the Brazil accident, GM-CSF had been used to treat some leukemia patients, and lab tests showed it helped animals suffering radiation sickness. 

   According to the Lancet report, four of the eight Brazilians given GM-CSF died of causes unrelated to the treatment. 
Of the four survivors, all showed a significant recovery in their immune systems. 
The doctors acknowledged the information was scanty, and that such scientifically uncontrolled work couldn't tell whether GM-CSF actually saved lives. 

   The results, preliminary data which have been debated for weeks at scientific conferences, were immediately criticized as inconclusive. 
"It wasn't a good test of GM-CSF," said Dr. Clarence Lushbaugh, chief of radiation medicine Oak Ridge Associated Universities, an affiliate of the U.S. Energy Department's big nuclear lab at Oak Ridge, Tenn. 
He said there isn't any doubt among specialists that GM-CSF may help future radiation victims, but that the Brazilian results prove nothing. 

   Dr. Lushbaugh said further, rigorous scientific studies are needed to judge GM-CSF. 
"There's still a lot we don't know" about treating radiation sickness, he said.
