   Two years after the Chernobyl power station was
the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident, nepotism, sloppy
repairs and drunkenness are rampant at the facility, Pravda charged.
   The problems cited by the Communist Party daily were similar to
those the government blamed for an explosion and fire at the plant
on April 26, 1986.
   Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the
accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10
years in a labor camp.
   Pravda said on Sunday that during the last two years engineering
jobs at the plant have been handed out to medics, teachers,
veterinarians and people without any higher education.
   It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to ``resolve at
any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant
``to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of
extremely intricate equipment.''
   ``Judging from all this, the leadership ... has not learned a
lesson from the past,'' Pravda said. ``It's as though there hasn't
been an accident.''
   The explosion at the plant 80 miles north of the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev killed 31 people, spewed radiation around the world
and forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living nearby.
   The scathing attack in Pravda was a departure from the numerous
articles appearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary.
   Previous stories have stressed the extensive safety equipment
installed at Chernobyl, improved worker training, the decrease to
safe levels of radiation and the return of people to surrounding
areas.
   Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and
the production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity there
since the accident.
   But then the focus turned to criticism by the Kiev region's
Communist Party committee of ``Kombinat,'' the organization
supervising the plant and cleanup around it.
   Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and
was not tested before being put into service despite serious
defects, the newspaper said.
   Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plant
were not carried out because of Kombinat's negligence, Pravda said.
That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed in
concrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports have
stressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized.
   ``Leadership posts were given to people who had criminal
records, who had been excluded from the party or had received
strict party penalties,'' Pravda said.
   ``Units were headed by people not able to cope with the business
they were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians and
people not having any higher education were working in engineering
posts,'' Pravda said.
   Discipline was slack, the newspaper said.
   ``In the `Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery and
violations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said.
   Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken,
other than to report that Kiev party leaders reprimanded Kombinat's
head, and indicated he had been fired.
   ``E. Ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity in
the evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations of
organizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism,
moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said.
   The article indicated that plant managers tolerated the
shortcomings because of a widespread problem in Soviet industry:
pressure to fulfill a production plan.
   The government has said it must increase the production of
nuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. The
Chernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, has
been ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year.
   Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. V.
Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town for
plant workers near Chernobyl, told a newspaper that sloppy work,
poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to
36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal.
   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl clean-up
commission, denied at a Moscow news conference on Wednesday that
any major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986
explosion.
