Radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster is still spreading in Byelorussia 
almost three years after the accident and has contaminated one-fifth of the 
republic's arable soil, Pravda said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We harvest hundreds of thousands of tons of contaminated grain and do not know 
what to do with it," the Communist Party newspaper quoted Mikhail V. Kovalev, 
premier of the Byelorussian Soviet Republic, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Chernobyl plant's No. 4 reactor, which exploded in April, 1986, in 
the world's worst nuclear disaster, is in the Ukrainian Republic, the 
radioactive pollution released by the accident spread north to neighboring 
Byelorussia. 
</P>
<P>
There has been little in the Soviet media about the consequences of the 
accident in Byelorussia, however, with most reports instead focusing on damage 
in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
"The influence of the Chernobyl accident and its consequences on the territory 
of Byelorussia is not diminishing," Kovalev was quoted as saying. "The 
territory is contaminated more than we supposed. More than one-fifth of the 
republic's agricultural land is contaminated." 
</P>
<P>
Kovalev said residents of the Byelorussian cities of Gomel, 100 miles north of 
Chernobyl, and Mogilyov, 200 miles from the plant, had to be given additional 
funds to defray the costs of finding uncontaminated food. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the accident, authorities marked off a 19-mile forbidden zone 
around the nuclear plant, 60 miles north of the Ukraine's capital of Kiev. They 
evacuated about 100,000 people from the area and began efforts to decontaminate 
the soil and buildings and halt radioactive fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) we did not manage to stop the spreading of the contamination in 
Byelorussia," Kovalev said. "The roads have contaminated dust. The population 
uses contaminated peat and firewood." 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup in Byelorussia has cost about $1.4 billion so far, Kovalev said.
