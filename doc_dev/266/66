   Nuclear power plant operators from around the
world gathered in Moscow on Monday to form a new association to
share safety information and prevent a repetition of accidents such
as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
   Representatives of more than 300 power stations in 30 countries,
including the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain,
signed a charter inaugurating the World Association of Nuclear
Operators.
   Charter members represent about 115 of the 130 power companies
that produce electricity from nuclear reactors.
   ``Several major nuclear accidents, including Chernobyl, showed
that there were problems in communication,'' Soviet Atomic Energy
Minister Nikolai Lukonin, a co-chairman of the new association,
told the session. ``These problems have become global problems.''
   The association was conceived after the April 1986 fire and
explosion at Chernobyl in the Ukraine killed at least 31 people and
sent a poisonous cloud of radioactivity into the atmosphere.
   After Chernobyl, it became necessary to form a system of sharing
safety information to prevent future accidents, Lukonin said.
   The other co-chairman, Lord Walter Marshall of Britain's Central
Electricity Generating Board, said sharing information was
essential to prevent accidents such as Chernobyl and the 1979
nuclear waste spill at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
   ``The nuclear community has learned its lesson in painful
ways,'' he said. ``If utilities had acted together, these accidents
might not have happened.''
   ``Chernobyl has created determination among nuclear operators to
work together,'' he said.
   The association already has established regional headquarters in
Atlanta, Moscow, Paris and Tokyo. A communications center will be
operated in London to transmit information to member utilities,
Marshall said.
   According to the charter, its mission ``is to maximize the
safety and reliability of the operation of nuclear power plants by
exchanging information, encouraging comparison, emulation and
communication among its members.''
   Marshall said, ``nuclear power only benefits mankind if safety
is kept at the highest possible level.''
   He said the ultimate responsibility for safety rests with the
organizations that operate the plants. ``Each has a responsibility
to learn from others and avoid making mistakes made elsewhere,''
Marshall said.
   The two-day meeting ends Tuesday with election of a president
and arrangements for the next general assembly in two years.
   Many Soviets have become afraid of nuclear power since the
Chernobyl accident, and Soviet officials have canceled or curtailed
several plants because of stricter standards.
   Officials closed two nuclear generators at an Armenian power
plant located near a geological fault after the Dec. 7 earthquake
in northern Armenia.
