   More than 100 victims of radiation in the
Chernobyl nuclear accident have started a hunger strike to protest
inadequate medical care, including shortages of drugs and hospital
beds, the Tass news agency says.
   The news agency, quoting a report in the labor daily Trud, said
about 120 people were fasting at the Institute of Medical
Radiology. The institute is in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov, 400
miles southwest of Moscow.
   Another 280 radiation victims in nearby Izum threatened to join
the strike if their demands were not met, Tass said. The news
agency did not say when the strike began.
   Two political groups in the Ukraine, the Greens movement and a
group calling itself Chernobyl, plan to picket the republic's
nuclear power stations on the fourth anniversary of the disaster,
according to the Interfax news agency, an affiliate of Radio Moscow.
   On April 26, 1986, a fire and explosion at the Chernobyl plant
near Kiev in the Ukraine killed at least 31 people. Radioactive
contamination affected millions of acres of land. Nearly 100,000
people were relocated because of the poisoned environment.
   The weekly Moscow News reported in November the death toll had
reached more than 250, including victims who were working at the
plant during the disaster and those who helped in the cleanup.
   A spokesman for the government agency responsible for the
cleanup confirmed the figure of 250 dead but said only the
long-recognized official death toll of 31 could be attributed
directly to the accident.
   In Kiev, the Presidium of the Ukraine Supreme Soviet has
designated April 26 ``Chernobyl Tragedy Day,'' Tass said Friday.
The legislative body earlier this month voted to phase the station
out of operation over the coming years.
   On Thursday, 140 Soviet children who suffered radiation exposure
after the Chernobyl explosion arrived in Havana for medical
treatement and tests. The children, ranging in age from 4 to 15,
were greeted by Cuban President Fidel Castro, the Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina reported Friday.
   Castro pledged to help another 10,000 children who Soviet
doctors estimate were exposed to radiation, the Mexican government
news service Notimex reported.
   Tass said 120 people in Kharkov were on a hunger strike as of
Wednesday. Their demands were not new. They were first presented to
the Congress of People's Deputies at its inaugural session in May
1989, then were sent to the Soviet and Ukrainian governments, trade
unions and health ministries, Tass said.
   A resolution adopted by the regional Trade Unions Council said
radiation victims should be given priority medical treatment, as
well as the necessary drugs and food, the news agency said.
   ``However, organizations in charge of implementing the
resolution have ignored the legitimate interests of Chernobyl
victims, despite receiving a notice of a possible hunger strike as
early as February,'' Tass said.
   It quoted a strike committee member as saying the fast ``will
continue until the protesters receive guarantees from the Soviet
leadership, or until the arrival of a special government
commission.''
   Tass gave no additional details of the conditions in which the
patients were kept, except to cite the shortages of hospital beds
and drugs. Both problems are common in the Soviet Union, where
top-quality health care is hard to find, but the government had
pledged that Chernobyl victims would be given priority.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature in Moscow is due to discuss
benefits for Chernobyl victims April 22, Tass said. It quoted Trud
as urging the Supreme Soviet to move the discussion up because of
the hunger strike.
