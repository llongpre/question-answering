   Soviets joined wdespread protests, a 24-hour
telethon and a strike at a major factory Thursday to mark the
fourth anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, the
reactor explosion at Chernobyl.
   It was the Soviet Union's biggest national commemoration of the
1986 disaster, and it followed years of state-encouraged passivity
on the topic.
   This year, the Ukrainian legislature designated Thursday as
``Chernobyl Tragedy Day'' and its Byelorussian counterpart passed a
similar measure. Other government bodies in contaminated areas
sanctioned demonstrations.
   Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four
reactors at the Chernobyl plant, in the Ukraine, caught fire and
exploded April 26, 1986. Unofficial reports say 250 died. The blast
spewed cesium, strontium and plutonium over a wide area of the
Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia and sent a cloud of radioactive gas
around the world.
   For the first two days after the accident, the Soviet Union
refused to report it to the outside world and withheld information
from its own people on the scope of the contamination.
   Residents in the southwestern Soviet regions most affected by
the partial meltdown organized demonstrations Thursday to demand
better medical treatment, protection from radiation and punishment
for officials who covered up the accident's effects, activists said.
   In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital 70 miles south of Chernobyl,
70,000 people gathered for Mass outside the 11th century Saint
Sophia Cathedral, reported Rukh Press International, a branch of
the Ukrainian people's front. In a subsequent protest, drivers
stopped traffic for five minutes and honked their car horns, the
report said.
   In the Byelorussian city of Gomel, most of the 35,000 employees
of the GomSelMash industrial complex staged a daylong strike, said
Alexander Korniev, a plant worker.
   Their demands included prompt closure of the Chernobyl plant and
criminal charges against all officials involved in the cover-up.
Three of Chernobyl's four reactors continue to operate.
   The Chernobyl Telethon, one of the Soviet Union's first
experiences with televised fund-raising, collected the equivalent
of about $115 million in rubles, as well $5 million in U.S.
dollars, organizers said.
   The live broadcast from Moscow interspersed singing groups and
interviews with gripping footage of Chernobyl rescuers and children
from the contaminated zone suffering radiation-caused cancers.
   Along with money, telethon pledges included donations of
radiation-free fruit and 1,100 pounds of honey for children in the
contaminated area.
   In the Byelorussian cities of Minsk and Gomel and throughout the
Ukraine, tens of thousands of residents gathered for church
services and mourning protests, Soviet TV reported.
   Vetka, north of Gomel, was among the small villages staging
demonstrations and strikes, according to local councilman Oleg
Gromyko.
   After dusk, Minsk residents lighted thousands of candles and
rang church bells, Tass reported.
   On the eve of the anniversary, the national parliament adopted a
$26 billion program that would involve resettling an additional
200,000 people from irradiated areas.
   After the accident, about 116,000 people were evacuated, and
some Soviet scientists and politicians have been campaigning for
further resettlements. They say 4 million Soviets live on
contaminated land.
   Many Chernobyl-area residents have complained of inadequate
medical care. Cases of anemia, leukemia and cancers have been
reported rising among people living on contaminated land. Many
residents still eat irradiated food because alternatives are not
available.
   Social and environmental fallout from the Chernobyl accident
continue in neighboring countries as well.
   In Sweden, which was in the path of the radioactive cloud,
authorities reported that fish from about 15 percent of its lakes
still are too contaminated to be eaten. It may take 30 years before
health authorities will clear the lakes.
   In Norway, newspapers reported that the level of cancer-causing
substances in the most affected regions is 10 times the normal
levels in plants and up to 20 times above normal in topsoil.
   In Czechoslovakia, Greenpeace environmentals scaled a cooling
tower at a nuclear power station. To cheers from onlookers they
hung a banner saying, ``Stop CSFRnobyl _ Greenpeace.'' CSFR is the
initials for the name of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic.
   A Czechoslovak hospital urged prosecution of its country's
Communist Party and government officials, whom it charged with
failing to take measures to protect citizens after the Chernobyl
accident.
   Official Soviet willingness to play up the Chernobyl anniversary
reflected the growing awareness of the catastrophe as well as the
reformist views of many new local governing councils.
   The television news program ``Vremya'' focused its afternoon
show on Chernobyl reports. ``We have been silent too long,'' a
Vremya reporter said.
   The Soviet legislature's new program was adopted Wednesday even
though many members criticized it as inadequate to deal with the
health, agricultural, economic and environmental aftermath of the
accident.
   The $26 billion earmarked Wednesday is twice the level spent in
the four years since the accident but still far short of the $405
billion Ukrainian legislator Yuri Scherback has estimated is needed
over the next 10 years.
