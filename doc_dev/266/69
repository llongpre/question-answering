   Officials raided a suburban warehouse
Wednesday and confiscated 4,600 cans of powdered milk suspected to
have been contaminated by radioactive fallout from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.
   Health Secretary Alfredo Bengzon, who led the raiders to a
warehouse in the Manila suburb of Paranaque, said the imported milk
was part of a shipment of dairy products returned to Western Europe
in 1986 after the accident.
   He said he ordered an investigation into how part of the
shipment was sent back to the Philippines.
   Last month, health officials also recovered more than 700 cans
of the contaminated milk that were distributed to several provinces
outside Manila.
   The local distributors of the milk product denied knowledge of
the shipment.
   An explosion and fire at the Soviet nuclear plant in April 1986
killed 31 Soviets and sent a cloud of radiation around the world.
It was the world's worst nuclear power accident.
