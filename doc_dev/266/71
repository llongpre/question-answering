   A Soviet parliamentary delegation, decrying
the secrecy their government imposed after the Chernobyl nuclear
accident four years ago, made an urgent appeal to the United States
and the world Friday for help in dealing with towering medical and
human problems.
   Severe shortages exist in medical equipment, radiological and
other scientific laboratories, radiation detectors, housing for
scores of thousands of relocated people and even baby food, the
five-man delegation said at a news conference at the Soviet Embassy.
   ``The history of mankind never knew an ecological catastrophe
which is so disastrous and having unknown consequences for the
nature, health and life of the present and future generations,''
the delegation said, relaying an appeal made originally by
officials of the Ukraine and endorsed this week by the Supreme
Soviet.
   Yuri N. Shcherbak, chairman of the ecology subcommittee of the
Supreme Soviet and a physician, said it had taken a political
struggle to open secret medical records and uncover the true extent
of the damage caused by the radiation that poured from the
Chernobyl reactor 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
   The accident, on April 26, 1986, began with a fire in one of
four reactors followed by a core meltdown and an explosion, which
sent huge quantities of radiation billowing into the atmosphere.
   Dr. Shcherbak said thyroid disorders are beginning to appear
along with the first cases of leukemia and cancer, including
thyroid cancer in infants.
   He said serious medical effects are now expected to last
decades, perhaps centuries.
   ``Chernobyl is the gravest warning to all humankind; the warning
that the development of super technology systems may lead to great
damage and perhaps a threat to all living things on earth,'' he
said.
   Kakimbek S. Salykov, chairman of the delegation, said that
deaths attributed to Chernobyl have reached at least 300, compared
to the official report of 31, and that some 150,000 people show
some effects of radiation poisoning.
   But he said the true extent of medical damage may never be known
because a shroud of secrecy was placed on data after the accident
and no statistics were compiled on the effects of radiation on the
600,000 people who took part in the initial cleanup.
   He said that after the accident, the death rate among the 600
workers at the Chernobyl plant ``increased tenfold,'' including
several deaths from cancer.
   Dr. Shcherbak said that 1.5 million people ``got a great dose of
radiation'' and that the leukemia rate in the Kiev area is 2.6
times to 3.8 times greater than before the accident.
   ``Thirteen thousand persons must be relocated as soon as
possible,'' he said.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin said that when the effects on
other Soviet republics are taken into account, some 4 million
people may have been exposed to excessive levels of radiation.
   The delegation released these other statistics:
   _12.5 million acres of farmland and 1.5 million acres of forests
in the Ukraine alone were affected by contamination.
   _The contaminated area of the Ukraine contained more than 1,600
towns and villages with more than 1.5 million inhabitants.
   _More than 90,000 people have been resettled from the
contaminated zones to 101 new villages in unaffected areas and
thousands more will be soon.
   _The ``obsolete'' Chernobyl reactors will be shut down
permanently this year or next.
