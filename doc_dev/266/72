   Sloppy repairs, drunkenness and nepotism are
rampant at the Chernobyl nuclear plant two years after the world's
worst nuclear disaster, Pravda said Sunday.
   The Communist Party daily said engineering jobs at the plant
were handed out to medics, teachers, veterinarians and people
without any higher education.
   It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to ``resolve at
any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant
``to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of
extremely intricate equipment.''
   The scathing attack was a departure from the numerous articles
appearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary of the
April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the power plant 80 miles
north of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
   The explosion killed 31 people, spewed radiation around the
world and forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living near the
plant.
   The previous stories have stressed the extensive safety
equipment installed at the plant, improved worker training, the
decrease to safe levels of radiation and the return of people to
surrounding areas.
   Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and
the production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity there
since the accident.
   But then the focus turned to criticism by the Kiev region's
Communist Party committee of ``Kombinat,'' the organization
supervising the plant and cleanup around it.
   Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and
was not tested before being put into service despite serious
defects, the newspaper said. It said other problems caused ``the
grossest violations of sanitary standards.''
   Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plant
were not carried out because of Kombinat's negligence, Pravda said.
That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed in
concrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports have
stressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized.
   ``Leadership posts were given to people who had criminal
records, who had been excluded from the party or had received
strict party penalties,'' Pravda said.
   ``Units were headed by people not able to cope with the business
they were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians and
people not having any higher education were working in engineering
posts,'' Pravda said.
   Discipline was slack, the newspaper said.
   ``In the `Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery and
violations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said.
   Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken,
other than to report that Kiev party leaders reprimanded Kombinat's
head, and indicated he had been fired.
   ``E. Ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity in
the evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations of
organizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism,
moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said.
   The party leaders also reprimanded the Chernobyl plant's
director.
   ``Judging from all this, the leadership of Kombinat has not
learned a lesson from the past,'' Pravda said. ``It's as though
there hasn't been an accident.''
   The article indicated that managers tolerated the shortcomings
because of a widespread problem in Soviet industry: pressure to
fulfill a production plan.
   The government has said it must increase the production of
nuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. The
Chernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, has
been ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year.
   Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. V.
Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town for
plant workers near Chernobyl, told a newspaper that sloppy work,
poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to
36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal.
   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl cleanup
commission, denied at a Moscow news conference Wednesday that any
major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986
explosion.
