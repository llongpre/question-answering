   Scientists say 106,000 people, nearly 10 times the
number recommended by the government, should be evacuated from
their villages because of contamination from the Chernobyl nuclear
plant disaster, Tass reported.
   The Supreme Soviet, or legislature, in the republic of
Byelorussia on Friday tentatively approved legislation that calls
for resettling 11,000 people during the next five years, the Soviet
news agency said.
   ``Special attention will be paid to children from areas affected
by Chernobyl fallout,'' Tass said.
   But during the debate, delegates to the national Congress of
People's Deputies attending the session and scientists from
Byelorussia proposed more sweeping measures _ including the
evacuation of 106,000 people, Tass said Saturday.
   The April 26, 1986, accident at the No. 4 reactor of the
four-unit nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine killed two
workers immediately in the world's worst atomic accident. Hundreds
were hospitalized, including 31 who later died from
radiation-related injuries.
   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of
northern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from
several countries. More than 130,000 people were evacauted after
the accident.
   The plant is 80 miles north of the Ukraine capital of Kiev.
Byelorussia is north of the Ukraine and was in the main path of the
fallout from the accident.
   The government evacuation program for Byelorussia is based on
people who are at risk of being exposed to 35 rems during a
lifetime. A rem is the standard unit of measurement for the amount
of radiation absorbed by living tissue.
   Thirty-five rems is 35,000 millirems. The typical diagnostic
chest X-ray involves between 20 millirems and 30 millirems of
radiation.
   The legislators and scientists recommended that normal living
conditions be made the criteria rather than a ceiling on the
cumulative number of rems.
   ``The most controversy was caused by the list of villages whose
residents need to be resettled to radioactive-free territories,''
Tass said.
   Tass said they realized that, at a cost of $15.6 billion, their
proposals could not be realistically handled by the republic's
budget. But, Tass said, ``they feel that Chernobyl is a disaster of
the whole country, so the whole country must participate in curing
the wounds.''
   However, the original proposal to resettle 11,000 was adopted on
the first reading and a standing commission was given the
assignment of reviewing it and submitting it to the Byelorussian
people for discussion, Tass said.
   The proposed evacuation includes 12 districts with more than 500
villages, in the Gomel and Mogilev regions, about 100 miles
northest of the Chernobyl disaster site.
