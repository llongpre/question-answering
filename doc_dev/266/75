   Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday ordered a freeze on new
atomic energy projects beginning next year in the Russian republic
that comprises three-quarters of the Soviet Union's territory.
   A directive from the republic's Parliament, signed by Yeltsin as
Russian president and distributed by the official news agency Tass,
charged that national government ministries are ill-equipped to
process and store radioactive wastes.
   The move highlighted concern about nuclear power in the wake of
the 1986 Chernobyl accident, and was the reform-minded Russian
president's first direct challenge to the Kremlin since he was
elected last month.
   The directive also called on the Russian republic's government
to develop a proposal for banning the burial on Russian territory
of radioactive waste from other nations or in the other 14 Soviet
republics, also beginning next year.
   It was not immediately clear whether the order would cause a
direct confrontation between Yeltsin's government and national
officials over any specific projects.
   A rising anti-nuclear mood across the entire Soviet Union has
forced Soviet officials to delay or cancel several nuclear power
plants the last four years.
   Yeltsin's directive also said the Ministry of the Sea Fleet and
the Defense Ministry added to the problem of nuclear waste. The
order did not directly say military nuclear projects must be frozen
as well, but appeared to include them.
   The seven-point directive cited increasing stockpiles of
radioactive wastes and the ``low technological level of the
management approach to solving the problem of gathering, processing
and eliminating radioactive wastes.''
   It said that combination ``created an unhealthy ecological and
social-psychological situation in a series of regions of the
Russian republic.''
   The directive said the Russian republic would ask that the
Kremlin write a program for dealing with radioactive waste that
includes a time period for implementation and delineates
responsiblity. It called for the program to be worked out before
June 1991.
   The Russian government was instructed to review all existing
radioactive waste sites in its jurisdiction and make
recommendations about how and whether they should be used.
   Until a national program is enacted, the directive said it would
be considered ``unacceptable to start construction of new atomic
energy sites on the territory of the Russian republic from Jan. 1,
1991.''
   The Russian Council of Ministers was instructed to ``prepare a
proposal to prohibit burial on the territory of the Russian
republic the final products of the activity of atomic sites from
other republics and countries beginning Jan. 1, 1991.''
   Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four
reactors at the Chernobyl plant, in the Ukraine, caught fire and
exploded April 26, 1986. Unofficial reports say 250 died.
   The blast spewed cesium, strontium and plutonium over a wide
area of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia, and also sent a cloud
of radioactive gas around the world.
   This April, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the
accident, the Soviet government decided to resettle 200,000 more
people living in the area of the Chernobyl plant at a cost of about
$26 billion.
   But Soviets, increasingly concerned about contamination of their
environment, also are worried about the safety of nuclear energy
used in industry and to power ships such as ice breakers and
submarines.
   The Soviet government has only recently acknowledged other major
nuclear accidents. Last June, officials said that in 1957 a tank of
radioactive waste exploded at a weapons site in the southern Ural
Mountains, showering almost 400 square miles with radioactive waste
and forcing evacuation of 10,000 people.
