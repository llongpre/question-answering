Mikhail S. Gorbachev is reported this week to be visibly frustrated by the 
uncanny series of natural, man-made and man-aggravated disasters that have 
plagued his country during his regime. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, even as news arrives of the latest catastrophe -- a natural gas 
explosion in which nearly 500 are dead or missing -- troubling evidence from 
previous disasters continues to accumulate, posing more challenges to 
Gorbachev's perestroika program. The latest findings about the Chernobyl 
nuclear disaster strongly suggest that about 15 Chernobyl-type reactors in the 
Soviet Union should be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I started to investigate the Chernobyl disaster, inspired by some of 
the procedures Caltech physicist Richard Feynman devised as a member of a 
presidential commission looking into the Challenger accident. Shortly before 
his death early last year, Feynman described how he had discovered, during a 
visit to a NASA facility in Huntsville, Ala., that NASA engineers considered a 
space shuttle catastrophe a near statistical certainty before the disaster 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Editing a version of Feynman's account for a physics magazine, it occurred to 
me that it might be interesting to ask the leading experts on Chernobyl in the 
United States how likely they considered another Chernobyl-like accident. 
During the next year I interviewed top people at the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, the Department of Energy, their counterparts in Canada and 
specialists in the academic world, industry and government laboratories. The 
results were disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
The standard explanation for Chernobyl has been that a steam explosion 
destroyed the reactor, suggesting that it was like a pot boiling over on your 
stove or, at worst, a pressure-cooker mishap that put a mess of radioactive pea 
soup on your ceiling. In fact, the reactor blew up like an atomic bomb. It of 
course did not blow up with the full efficiency or force of an atomic bomb, but 
the physical processes that blew up the reactor were the same forces that cause 
a bomb to explode. Moreover, the corrective measures taken by the Soviets do 
not preclude an equally severe accident and some of the measures may make an 
accident more rather than less likely. 
</P>
<P>
I first got an inkling of what happened at Chernobyl during an interview with 
Richard Wilson, a reactor expert at Harvard who has visited Chernobyl twice. 
When I asked Wilson to comment on a description of the accident as a "slow 
nuclear explosion," expecting him to pooh-pooh the claim, he said: "To ever say 
it was not a nuclear explosion is just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl reactors have the unfortunate defect of speeding up, under 
certain conditions, rather than slowing down when water is lost. Compounding 
this defect, the top of the reactor is poorly sealed, so that surprisingly 
little excess pressure will rupture the lid. As a result, a loss of water could 
cause nuclear reactions to go out of control, generating enough pressure to 
blow up the reactor vessel and release large quantities of radioactive material 
into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately before the accident on the night of April 25-26, 1986, the plant's 
operators were preparing to do an unusual test, after which they planned to 
shut the reactor down for annual maintenance and refueling. They took a series 
of reckless measures that put the reactor into its most unstable state, 
unleashing an uncontrolled and uncontrollable nuclear reaction. "Once power 
began to rise rapidly," says Edward Purvis, head of the Department of Energy's 
study team, "nothing could have been done to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
In just a second or two, this first explosion sent the reactor's power soaring 
from close to zero to between 50 and 100 times the plant's maximum normal 
capacity. This was an enormously more violent event than had ever been 
described or imagined in the voluminous U.S. literature on reactor safety. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness accounts and Soviet computer analyses strongly suggest that there 
was a second explosion, perhaps 10 times more violent than the first. While 
interpretations vary, the most plausible is that the severely damaged core 
collapsed on itself, formed a critical mass or several critical masses and blew 
up like a bomb. This explosion "completed the destruction of Chernobyl Unit 4," 
Purvis says. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Denton, the former Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety chief who 
managed emergency operations at Three Mile Island in 1979, said that he and his 
colleagues worried at that time that a nuclear explosion could take place. But 
they brought in consultants who concluded that TMI's molten core could not form 
a critical mass and explode. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess the probability of another catastrophic accident at a 
Chernobyl-type reactor, Denton said: "We would not license such a reactor 
here." 
</P>
<P>
For decades, spokesmen for the nuclear industry have insisted that reactors 
cannot blow up like bombs. But the Chernobyl reactor did blow up like a bomb, 
and a similar accident is remotely conceivable in Canada's reactors. Perhaps 
industry spokesmen should have said that most reactors, or all reactors in the 
United States, cannot blow up like bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Gale, the UCLA bone marrow specialist who flew to the Soviet Union to 
help Chernobyl victims, has said he believes that Chernobyl was the catalytic 
event that prompted Gorbachev to launch his bold arms-control initiatives. If 
Chernobyl had been a mere steam explosion brought on mainly by operator error, 
Gale's view of things would make little sense. But it makes good sense if 
Gorbachev understood the accident to have been a nuclear explosion that 
created, on a small scale, the devastated landscape that we would have on a 
grand scale in the wake of an all-out nuclear war.
