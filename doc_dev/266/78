<HEAD>Soviet Byelorussian Envoy Appeals for $17 Billion in Chernobyl Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ambassador of the Soviet Byelorussian
republic appealed Tuesday for billions of dollars in foreign aid
for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
   Lev Maksimov, permanent U.N. representative of the republic,
told a news conference that the nuclear power plant accident on
April 26, 1986, has caused ``untold misery and suffering'' among
the republic's people.
   He said death, birth defects and illness related to radiation
have increased, but he could not provide statistics. Medical
equipment and assistance urgently are needed, Maksimov said.
   The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant sent a cloud of
radiation around the world and was the worst commercial nuclear
accident in history.
   So far, Maksimov said, foreign assistance in cash, food, medical
supplies and other aid has amounted to only about $6 million, but
little of the aid has come from foreign governments.
   Within the Soviet Union, Maksimov said, the central government
and neighboring republics have contributed the equivalent of about
$2 billion in disaster relief.
   But he said at least $17 billion more is needed in various types
of aid.
   Maksimov said his government urgently needs radiation monitors,
ultrasound diagnostic equipment, endoscopes for examining chest and
digestive tracts and foodstuffs.
   Maksimov said thousands of people have been evacuated and
resettled and another 188,000 should be resettled.
   About 20 percent of the farmland has been contaminated and
tainted soil must be removed, he said. Also, animals contaminated
by radiation must be replaced and more foodstuffs are needed,
Maksimov said.
