THE STORY OF CHERNOBYL by Piers Paul Read Secker &amp; Warburg, 478 pages,
Pounds 16.99
Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear accident, is a tantalising target for a
writer. The events of the night of April 26 1986 were shrouded in
KGB-protected secrecy by the Soviet government for years, despite the
clamourings of other countries to know how the accident happened.
But as the Soviet Union disintegrated, the print-outs from the reactor's
computers, the tape recordings of the men in the control room, and the
medical records of the surrounding population gradually emerged. Chernobyl's
scientists and directors have also been increasingly prepared to talk to
foreign writers; many appear remorseful for having helped cover up the full
story. Piers Paul Read has interviewed two of the most senior staff in
control of the reactor that night: Victor Brukhanov, Chernobyl's director,
and Anatoli Dyatlov, deputy chief engineer.
By far the best part of the book is the account of the panic, terror and
extraordinary courage on the night of the explosion. Scientists and
technicians - who thought at first that war had broken out - streamed along
corridors in the dark as their instruments failed. They heaved at twisted
metal doors to reach the control rods and put their hands into radioactive
pools to turn safety valves. They slung injured colleagues over their
shoulders as they fled for the exits, even though the radioactivity from the
contaminated clothing burned deep sores into their flesh.
Read provides a powerful reminder, too, of the peculiarly horrible effects
of radiation on the human body, one of the reasons why western Europe's
environmental pressure groups are so fiercely opposed to nuclear power.
Thirty-one people died immediately or within days. They watched their own
bodies rot, their intestines dissolve and the skin on their legs fall down
like loose socks.
The book goes a long way to explaining how the disaster happened, pointing a
finger at the Soviet planning system. Components to build Chernobyl's four
reactors - secured after tortuous negotiations with the strangely named
Ministry of Medium Machine Building - rarely arrived in working order or on
time. The plant's directors, says Read, struggled to meet impossible
construction targets, while juggling Communist party demands to diversify
into consumer goods and to construct two hay barns for a local farm.
Locked into that system, Chernobyl's staff believed that initiative, even on
the brink of disaster, would be penalised. That led them to persist with an
experiment on the plant's electricity turbines even when it started to go
wrong - ironically, the reactor ran out of control during long-overdue tests
on its safety.
The book makes too much of the faultiness of the reactor's control rods,
although the imperfections were confirmed this year in a report by the
International Atomic Energy Authority, the nuclear watchdog. The
ill-designed safety tests and the generally poor standards of construction
were the main causes.
It also does little to solve the main remaining mystery of Chernobyl: how
many people were made ill, or saw their children born deformed. Read points
out, movingly, that figures are hard to establish because the general health
of the population is so poor, undermined by pollution and inadequate
nutrition. But he cites estimates - which range from the 31 who died to 'as
many as (in) the second world war' - without saying which should be taken
seriously.
This is a symptom of the book's biggest weakness. It relies heavily on
secondary sources - particularly Ukrainian and Russian newspaper reports -
and attributes too few of its main assertions to any identifiable source.
Important points lack substantiation, such as his claim that, before the
explosion, there was 'anxiety in the highest quarters about the shortcomings
in construction'. His fondness for the passive tense also leaves too many
questions dangling about who took critical decisions at the plant - the
identity of the person who ordered the go-ahead for evacuation of the town,
for example.
Surprisingly, given his talent as a novelist, the pace suffers from Read's
technique of retelling the events several times to reflect the different
perspectives of the plant's workers, the politicians and the local
residents. He also indulges in at least half a dozen repetitions of
passages, and in clumsy metaphors, although it is perhaps inevitable that
the glowing core of the destroyed reactor is compared to a glimpse of hell.
Unfortunately, towards the end, his prose not only describes but resembles
the ponderous and labyrinthine ways of the Soviet command economy.
That said, he is right that Chernobyl has become a powerful symbol. The
explosion has come to represent the atrophy of the Soviet Union and 'its
subsequent melt-down', as Read puts it. It is also seen as a turning point
in the promise of nuclear power to deliver cheap energy without much risk,
even in poorly managed countries.
Read's final suggestion - that human fallibility means nuclear power can
never be safe - seems unnecessarily fatalistic, however. The lessons of
Chernobyl are precise ones - the apparent impotence of United Nations bodies
such as the IAEA, and the way the nuclear industry's military connections
are frequently used to restrict information.
Western countries also have plenty of evidence now that there is a threat of
a second Chernobyl at some of the crumbling reactors in eastern Europe or
the former Soviet Union. They know that sending money, technicians and
components could reduce the risks. There is an argument, which Read does not
explore, that if another accident were to occur, the blame should fall on
the inadequacy of western action rather than on the innate dangers of
nuclear power.
