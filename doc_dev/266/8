   The Reagan administration on Tuesday urged
speedy Senate ratification of two treaties negotiated in the
aftermath of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in
the Soviet Union which spread nuclear contamination across Western
Europe.
   One treaty requires prompt notification of a nuclear disaster
which has the potential of affecting other nations. The second sets
up a system for providing assistance after a nuclear accident.
   Frederick M. Bernthal, assistant secretary of state for
scientific affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the
objective of the pacts is to ``minimize the radiological
consequences of a nuclear accident, should one occur.''
   He said the treaties stem from the international concern over
``the failure of the Soviet Union to notify the rest of the world
in a timely manner'' after the accident at Chernobyl.
   The treaties were drafted in a four-week period in the summer of
1986 by a conference of 62 nations meeting in Vienna.
   The notification treaty covers accidents at nuclear reactors,
nuclear fuel cycle facilities and radioactive waste management
facilities.
   It also covers accidents involving the transport and storage of
nuclear fuels or radioactive waste as well as radioisotopes used to
generate power in space objects of any kind.
   Accidents involving nuclear weapons are not covered by the
treaty, but a provision does encourage nations to volunteer
information on nuclear weapons accidents.
   The United States has pledged to ``voluntarily provide
notification'' on any nuclear accident, including accidents
involving nuclear weapons.
   The second treaty provides guidelines on the provision of
technical assistance to minimize the effects of nuclear accidents.
   While it does not require any country to provide such
assistance, it does require a prompt response to requests for such
help.
   The administration also asked ratification of a third treaty
intended to protect a Western seat on the board of governors of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
   Bernthal said the change became necessary when the Peoples
Republic of China became a member of the International Atomic
Energy Agency and claimed a seat on the board of directors.
   Bernthal said China's inclusion on the board of governors could
have put a Western seat at risk.
   ``It is important to U.S. national security not to dilute
Western influence on the IAEA board,'' Bernthal said.
   The treaty would expand the number of seats on the board by one
and would ``put all countries back in their starting position,''
Bernthal said. ``In short, ratification of this amendment will
protect a Western seat.''
