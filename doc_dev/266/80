   The shadow of Chernobyl fell over world financial markets yesterday. 

   Rumors of a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union rippled through every major market, sending investors scrambling for safe havens while governments and journalists embarked on a frantic effort to confirm the reports. 
Officials in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Great Britain and the U.S., as well as the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, all added to the confusion as they sought to confirm the reports. 

   Ironically, the rumors -- flatly denied by Soviet officials -- may have been ignited by the IAEA's new, elaborate system designed to warn about a repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power-plant disaster. 
But hours after the denial, it still wasn't clear how the rumor began and grew. 

   Indeed, after the rumors appeared quashed yesterday afternoon, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in New York that Swedish monitors yesterday registered some form of difficulty with a Soviet nuclear facility, but he termed it an "incident rather than an accident." 
Later, his office in Washington retracted the statement, saying the energy secretary was given "bad information." 

   The rumors apparently first surfaced on European foreign-exchange markets late in their trading morning and soon spread to other markets. 
Traders fanned the flames after learning East European banks were selling gold and aggressively buying dollars, said Mark Slater, a Salomon Brothers Inc. vice president in London. 
Investors see the U.S. currency as a safe haven during international crises. 
Meanwhile world equity and commodity markets were thrown into turmoil. 

   Early in the afternoon Tidnigarnas Telegrambyra, Sweden's national news agency, put a bulletin on a news wire. 
An editor said the agency had confirmed the rumors with two sources at Sweden's radiation board. 
International news agencies picked up the story almost immediately. 

   The U.S. State Department, White House, Defense Department and Nuclear Regulatory Agency all scrambled madly to check the reports. 
Meanwhile, Finland began testing nationwide for higher levels of radiation. 
A Swedish radio broadcast said the Finns found unusually high levels of radiation, but Finland denied that. 

   How did the rumors start? 
It still isn't clear. 
An IAEA spokeswoman accused Tokyo stock traders of inventing the story. 
A leading Stockholm newspaper blamed a possible mix-up over a small radiation leak from a hospital near Sweden's Radiation Protection Agency. 

   The favored theory was first put forward by a Norwegian government official. 
He said someone misread a series of test telexes describing bogus radiation readings that the IAEA sent to the United Kingdom's Meteorological Office in Bracknell, near London. 
The IAEA, watchdog of the world's nuclear industry, was conducting a test to make sure its new early-warning system would work in case of an emergency.
