<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: William J. Eaton -- Los Angeles Times; Pripyat, with a

Chernobyl plant. It became a ghost town after the 1986 accident, too "hot" --
too radioactive -- for people to live there.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  DURING THE late, unlamented Cold War, Western Europe used to worry about the
Soviet Union's arsenal of nuclear weapons. Those fears now have faded, to be
replaced by new ones: scores of unsafe nuclear reactors that Moscow has built
on its own territory and in Eastern Europe.;   These nuclear power plants are
regarded by experts as ticking timebombs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl focused attention on the
shortcomings of the Soviet program. These include inherent design flaws,
low-quality material and workmanship, inadequate fire protection and poor
maintenance.;   The "official" death toll at Chernobyl was said to be under
40. This is believed to be grossly understated. And foreign health agencies
believe that more than 4 million people run a higher risk of disease because
of the radioactive cloud that contaminated half of Europe.;   As recently as
Oct. 11, the Chernobyl plant had another "incident," a fire that broke out as
a turbine driven by the plant's No. 2 reactor, which still generates power,
was being idled for repairs. The 1986 disaster involved the No. 4 reactor, now
permanently out of commission.;   Most reactors in the Soviet Union and in its
former satellites lack containment domes, the huge concrete and steel
structures that prevent the release of radioactive materials during a nuclear
accident.;   Such reactors can be made somewhat safer, but they cannot be
brought up to Western standards. An effective containment vessel cannot be
added to an existing reactor.;   Sixteen Chernobyl-type reactors exist in the
Soviet Union, with two in independent Lithuania. In addition, the Soviets
built 23 reactors of other types in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and the
former East Germany that are considered dangerous.;   When West German
authorities gained access to five reactors in eastern Germany after
unification, they closed them for safety reasons. They also learned -- 15
years after the fact -- that a 1975 plant failure came within a hair of
obliterating the nearby town of Rheinsberg.;   Germany is wealthy and can
afford to replace the electricity that came from the five suspect reactors.
But the rest of Eastern Europe must live with the danger.;   Anthony
Churchill, a World Bank official, said of a study of the ex-communist
countries: "The conclusion was that there is simply no way that the old-style
plants can be made safe. The only way is to shut them down but, if you shut
them down, you shut the country down. Things can be done to improve
operational safety, but they remain accidents waiting to happen.";   The
likeliest candidate for another Chernobyl is Bulgaria, which operates five
reactors at Kozloduy, near Sofia. The International Atomic Energy Agency
recommended that the four oldest reactors there be shut down, advice that has
been rejected.;   Also, all the Soviet operators running the reactors returned
home when the Bulgarian government couldn't pay them in hard currency.;   Ivan
Selin, chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, recently inspected
eight reactors in Europe and confirmed that Bulgaria was short of operators at
Kozloduy.;   "There are plenty of people in Bulgaria who can run them, but no
economic reason to do so," he said. "You can make more money as a cabdriver in
Sofia.";   An official at the Paris-based Nuclear Energy Agency said the West
was considering modest financial aid. "I think we'll be putting a few
band-aids on some machines for people who don't have a rich German brother.
And then we will just keep our fingers crossed.";   But radiation is no
respecter of national borders, and the prosperous half of Europe should do
more than cross its fingers.  </TEXT>
