   A public outcry grew over a
just-disclosed nuclear accident that occurred a year ago in West
Germany, and officials acknowledged Tuesday that human errors were
involved.
   Hesse Environment Minister Karlheinz Weimar alleged a utility
company initially gave authorities a ``visibly wrong description of
the facts'' of the accident, a charge the semi-private
Rhine-Westfalia Electrical Company denies. Nobody was hurt when a
small amount of radioactive steam was released into the atmosphere
Dec. 16-17, 1987, at the Biblis reactor.
   But environmentalists charge technical and human errors could
have caused a serious nuclear accident at the plant, located in the
heavily populated Rhine River valley about 30 miles south of
Frankfurt.
   Weimar conceded he was mistaken to withhold details from the
public.
   ``In hindsight it is completely clear that it would have been
better if I had decided differently,'' he told reporters.
   He also alleged without elaboration that the utility company
initially ``resisted evaluations of the incident by authorities.''
   But the company insists it reported the incident in line with
federal and state regulations.
   Hesse state and federal officials have said they initially
believed the accident was less serious, but also insist there never
was any danger. Independent atomic energy observers agree.
   The accident was revealed by Inside NRC, an American biweekly
industry newsletter about nuclear safety.
   ``It is scandalous that the populace learns of this only a year
later through an American newsletter,'' said Ernst Welteke, head of
the Social Democratic Party in Hesse.
   West Germans have been sensitive about nuclear energy since the
1986 Chernobyl disaster released radioactivity in much of central
Europe.
   Social Democrats have demanded officials close the 1,200-megawatt
reactor at Biblis and environmentalists have increased calls for the
country to abandon nuclear power.
   Nuclear plants provide 35 percent of West Germany's power.
   A spokesman for Darmstadt's Oeko-Institute environmental research
organization drew parallels with human errors at the 1979 Three Mile
Island accident in Middletown, Pa.
   ``For 15 hours they (Biblis operators) didn't recognize an alarm
in the control room signalling that the position of a valve was not
correct. The same kind of thing happened at Three Mile Island,''
said Lothar Hahn.
   Atomic energy officials say plant operators either did not notice
the light for 15 hours or did not believe there was a malfunction.
   They also say reactor operators were wrong wrong to open a second
valve for a few seconds to try to close the malfunctioning one.
   The newsletter said opening the second valve allowed a small
amount of radioactive steam to escape into the atmosphere.
   Horst May, a spokesman for the Reactor Safety Institute, said
with the extra pressure on the second valve ``there would have been
danger that the pipes could break which might have meant a loss of
coolant.'' But he added the reactor has several emergency backup
systems to prevent this.
   Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said as a result of the Biblis
incident nuclear reactors across the country have been outfitted
with equipment to avoid such accidents and work crews have received
new training.
