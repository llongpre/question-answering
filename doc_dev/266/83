   One year after Chernobyl's radioactive cloud spread across Europe, children play outdoors, livestock graze and fresh vegetables are sold without restriction. 
The lurking danger, if any, is hidden: Scientists say the disaster's full impact on health will remain unknown for years. 

   While a lifetime of medical measurements looms for most of the 135,000 Soviets evacuated from the Chernobyl area, the fate of those closest to the blast is tragically clear. 

   In the three months following the accident, 29 Soviets died of acute radiation illness, including 11 who received bone-marrow transplants from U.S. surgeon Robert Gale. 
Four Soviet patients remain hospitalized with deep burns while some 200 have been discharged, according to Soviet authorities. 
Within the Soviet Union and in Europe, scientists expect increased cases of leukemia and cancer of the lung, breast, and thyroid. 
But "it's generally thought you would not see any evidence of leukemia for two to five years" after the accident, says Eugene Saenger, radiology professor at the University of Cincinnati. 

   Estimates swirl through the scientific community about the number of Chernobyl-related cancers that could develop. 

   At the low end is a United Nations report that says 170 extra cancer deaths will occur in the next 50 years among those evacuated, an increase of only 0.6% above normal. 
The report indicates an extra 5,000 cancer deaths will occur in all of Soviet Europe. 

   The British National Radiological Protection Board suggests 1,000 residents of the 12 Common Market countries will die of cancer over the next 50 years because of Chernobyl, compared with 30 million so-called natural cancer deaths. 

   But U.S. medical physicist John W. Gofman puts the number much higher, predicting an extra 600,000 to one million cancer cases, half of them fatal. 
"I cannot accept (the lower numbers) at all," because radiation is far more dangerous than official reports indicate, he says. 

   In calculating potential cancers, some reports use a "risk estimate" endorsed by the U.N. in 1977 and based on studies of Japanese atomic-bomb victims. 
But Dr. Gofman says more recent research in Japan suggests the risk is about 37 times greater than the U.N. figured. 

   Most scientists agree that only now -- more than 40 years after the atomic bombs fell -- are they learning the true risks of radiation. 
But whether the Japanese data can be applied to Chernobyl, where exposure was smaller though more prolonged, is another question. 

   Moreover, an individual's cancer risk can be modified by several factors -- age, sex, and habits such as smoking. 
One problem scientists face is distinguishing radiation-induced cancers from "normal" ones. 

   Radiation also can cause birth defects. 
Fetuses exposed to radiation between eight and 15 weeks after conception, when the brain develops, may suffer severe mental retardation. 

   At last month's U.N. conference, Soviet scientists said the Chernobyl accident caused no fatal birth defects. 
Dr. Gale predicts as many as 18 cases of radiation-induced severe mental retardation among children born to evacuated mothers. 
World-wide, he expects as many as 1,000 Chernobyl-related cases. 
Soviet children born after Chernobyl "appear normal," he says, but "we would not expect to detect (mental retardation) for another two years."
