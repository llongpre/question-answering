   Widespread fears of miscarriages or
birth defects in Sweden from the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident
are unfounded, the government said Wednesday.
   ``The conclusions that can be drawn from the research give no
support to the idea that radioactive fallout has had biological
effects as rumored at the time of the accident,'' said a statement
from the Department of Social Services.
   Sweden was one of several countries affected by fallout from the
April 1986 explosion at the Soviet nuclear power plant, which
killed 31 people in the Soviet Union in the world's worst nuclear
plant disaster.
   Radiation levels have been higher than normal among the reindeer
herders in Sweden's northern Lapland region. But winds at the time
of the accident blew most contamination north of Sweden's
population centers.
   Sweden's infant mortality rate showed a slight increase during
the survey period, amounting to 42 deaths higher than expected. But
Anders Ericson, a section chief at the department, said the
increase was attributed to random statistical variations.
   The infant deaths were not confined to areas with higher
fallout, he said by telephone.
   The study was conducted between 1986 and 1988 and covered
250,000 child births, Ericson said.
   It addressed miscarriages, legal abortions, underweight
children, birth mortality, early infant deaths and birth defects.
   ``We have so far seen no negative impact on the pregnancies that
were started after the accident,'' the report said.
   Ericson said abortions increased nationwide during the fall of
1986 and that pregnancies fell slightly during the summer months
because of fears the fallout could harm babies.
   Ericson said studies of a possible impact on tumors were under
way but would take six years to complete.
