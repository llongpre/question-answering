  [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- The European Union and 
Ukraine will sign a wide-ranging trade, cooperation and 
partnership agreement next month, an EU spokesman said during a 
meeting of EU foreign ministers here Monday [16 May]. 
  The meeting also gave general support for proposals that the 
EU and other western countries should help pay for new nuclear 
power stations in Ukraine so that the dangerous Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant can be closed down. 
  The spokesman said Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk was 
expected to sign the partnership accord at the next meeting of 
the EU's foreign affairs council in Luxembourg in mid-June. 
  The accord, initialled by the two sides in March, will give 
Ukraine greater access to western European markets for its 
exports, and a high-level political dialogue with Brussels. 
  It stipulates that Ukraine might be able to join a free 
trade 
area with the EU sometime after 1997 if it makes sufficient 
progress towards a free market. 
  The EU ministers agreed that the accord should be signed 
without delay, and not used as a lever to make sure that Kiev 
meets its commitments to get rid of all nuclear weapons 
inherited from the old Soviet Union. 
  The EU has acknowledged that Ukraine, a country roughly the 
size of France and formerly known as Russia's breadbasket, is in 
desperate need of help to prop up a sharply-declining economy 
and avoid social breakdown. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the partnership 
accord could still be used as pressure on Kiev to dismantle all 
the nuclear weapons, even after it was signed. 
  The European Commission outlined its proposal for helping 
finance the building of new nuclear power stations in Ukraine to 
replace the Chernobyl plant, where the world's worst civilian 
nuclear accident occurred in 1986. 
  The proposal is to be discussed at the G-7 summit of 
industrialised countries in Naples in July. 
  The Ukrainian authorities are still using two of Chernobyl's 
four nuclear units, on the grounds that Kiev is dependent on the 
plant for energy. They say they need three billion dollars to 
close it down and replace it. 
  The commission also won general support for a 100 million 
ECU 
(120 billion dollar) plan to send food to the Ukraine, so that 
it can be sold and the proceeds used to bolster the Ukrainian 
economy.
