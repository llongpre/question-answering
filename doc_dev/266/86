<LEADPARA>  The first international study of the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear accident
suggests its impact on the health of hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens
has been exaggerated.;    The report, released today for a four-day conference
on the 1986 accident, said researchers found widespread stress and anxiety
among citizens of affected areas of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and the Russian
republic.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the researchers found no evidence to corroborate suggestions from other
scientists that hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands of people would
suffer leukemia, thyroid and other health problems as a result of the world's
worst nuclear power plant accident.;    However, the yearlong study, conducted
by about 200 researchers from 25 countries under U.N. auspices, did not look
at people evacuated from around the plant or at the workers who helped clean
up after the disaster. Those are being monitored separately in a Soviet data
bank said to cover 530,000 to 570,000 people.;    An 18-mile zone around the
Chernobyl station was evacuated after an explosion on April 26, 1986, released
a cloud of radiation eventually detected around the world. People have since
been moved from a larger area.;    Viktor Gubanov, head of the Soviet
committee dealing with the consequences of Chernobyl, said today that 116,000
people were evacuated in 1986 and that plans call for the resettlement of
218,000 others to be completed by the end of 1992. About 20,000 of those still
are living in contaminated areas and will be moved this year, he said.;   
Soviet authorities say 31 people died as a direct result of the accident. Some
Soviet scientists say the actual toll was in the hundreds or even thousands.; 
  The study looked at the accident's consequences for about 825,000 people
living in 2,225 settlements across a 10,000-square-mile swath of Byelorussia,
the Ukraine and Russia.;    The study released today found most Soviet
children examined to be generally healthy. It said 10 percent to 15 percent of
adults required medical care, but said that proportion was no higher than
elsewhere in the Soviet Union.;    The researchers detected no statistically
significant increases in the rate of cancer, leukemia, thyroid complaints or
birth defects, the report said.  </TEXT>
