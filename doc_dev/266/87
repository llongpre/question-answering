  [Text] Budapest, 7 Feb (MTI) -- The Hungarian Army and the 
Ministry of the Interior's Fire and Civil Defence National 
Command have set up an Accident Information Centre in Budapest, 
in order to avert nuclear accidents and catastrophes. 
  The centre, to work as part of the operation staff of the 
nuclear accident prevention government committee, is to 
coordinate the national radiation monitoring, signalling and 
control systems of the two organizations. 
  The network is to provide continuous information from 60 
points throughout the country on the radioactive radiation 
level. The measuring stations are to measure the gamma doses in 
the air, which is termed harmful to health if measuring 500 
nanosievert per hour. (measurements between 1000 and 5000 nsv 
were registered in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear 
accident.) 
  With the decline in the danger of nuclear explosions and 
nuclear attacks, the accident information centre will mainly 
focus on nuclear power plant accidents, the delivery of nuclear 
materials, and possible meteorite impacts. 
  The majority of the measuring stations will be operated near 
barracks, as they are affiliated to the army, however, the 
Central Physics Research Institute of Budapest and the Paks 
Nuclear Power Plant (southern Hungary) will also carry out 
measurements. Data will be continuously evaluated and stored in 
the centre, and if higher than average figures are reported, 
immediate measures can be taken by involving the civil defence 
and army units.
