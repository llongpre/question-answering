<TEXT>     The blaze Friday night, which also forced the shutdown of a nuclear
reactor, was the worst accident at the Ukrainian plant since the 1986
disaster, which spewed radiation worldwide.;   "We cannot sit on this powder
keg any longer," Vladimir Yavorivsky, head of a Ukrainian parliamentary
commission on Chernobyl, told reporters in Kiev, 80 miles south of Chernobyl.;
  Yevgeny Ignatenko, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Atomic Power Industry
in Moscow, said Friday's fire broke out as a turbine driven by the plant's No.
2 reactor was being idled for repairs. The 1986 disaster involved the No. 4
reactor, now permanently out of commission.;   Ignatenko said that in the
midst of the planned shutdown, "an automatic switch turned the reactor on
again," producing a surge of current that ignited the insulating material on
some electric cables.;   His statement, carried by the Soviet news agency
Tass, said the initial fire was extinguished within a minute. However,
hydrogen leaked into the turbine room and burst into flames, setting the roof
ablaze and destroying a truss, the statement said. About 390 square feet of
roof collapsed.;   The fire was put out within 3 1/2 hours late Friday, before
it could spread into the reactor room, Tass said.;   The reactor was shut down
as a precaution.;   "No injuries or radiation release were reported. The
reactor is now being cooled," Ignatenko said on Saturday morning.;   Whether
to close the plant quickly, or wait for a replacement to be built, already is
a major campaign issue in the Ukraine's first popular presidential election
Dec. 1.;   The plant's director, Mikhail Umanets, told reporters he saw no
reason to shut down the station, which produces 30,000 kilowatts of
electricity a day. He said it would take 30-45 days to repair the damage.  </TEXT>
