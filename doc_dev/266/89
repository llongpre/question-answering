   Lapp reindeer herdsmen in villages hit
by fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident have thrown out
all the animals killed this week because radiation levels were many
times higher than allowed, a Swedish daily said Thursday.
   The Ostersunds Post said 400 reindeer were discarded in the
northern province of Jamtland after the annual slaughter when tests
on the meat disclosed cesium levels ranging up to 4,500 Becquerels
per pound.
   A Becquerel is a unit to describe the activity of radioactive
substance. The approved government limit for the meat for
consumption is about 680 Becquerels per pound.
   ``I'm beginning to lose faith that there is a future in raising
reindeer,'' said Thomas Ahstrand, 22, a herder reached by telephone
in his village of Frostviken.
   About 10 percent of Sweden's total reindeer slaughter was banned
for eating, the Ostersunds Post said.
   ``We raise reindeer for the garbage dumps. There is no sign that
the cesium levels are being reduced by even a few Becquerels,''
said Ahstrand, who bought his first herd of 50 animals just before
the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Ukraine sent up a cloud
of radioactivity in April 1986.
   Thirty-one people died in the world's worst nuclear plant
disaster.
   Sweden was badly affected by fallout because of a freak wind
that carried the radioactive isotope cesium 137 over a belt of the
northern and central regions. Sweden's 300,000 reindeer were
particularly vulnerable because they feed on lichen, which soaks up
cesium and is slow to dispose of the contamination.
   The Swedish government compensates the herders at market prices
for the destroyed meat, but the semi-nomadic Lapps, or Samis as
they prefer to call themselves, say their lifestyle has been
threatened.
   ``We ask ourselves how long will the government keep on
supporting us,'' said Ahstrand.
   Last year Ahstrand and other herdsmen rescued part of their
reindeer by moving them 250 miles south to graze in an
uncontaminated region. But the move was costly and difficult, and
the herdsmen stayed home this year.
   ``We felt that we didn't belong there. We have lived in the
mountains for so many centuries tending our herds among these
fields, it is more than an occupation. It's a way of life,'' said
Ahstrand.
