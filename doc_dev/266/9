   An American specialist tangled with his
Soviet colleagues Friday over the consequences of telling those
exposed by the Chernobyl nuclear accident that they face a greater
risk of developing cancer.
   ``Many people in Kiev worry about what will happen to them. They
don't want to have children,'' said Robert Gale, a U.S. doctor who
helped treat the sickest victims of the April 26, 1986, accident at
the nuclear power station 80 miles north of here.
   The American specialist, a spectator, spoke at the end of a news
conference by Soviet specialists winding up a three-day meeting on
the medical effects of the accident.
   Gale urged a widespread discussion of the possibility of future
cancer deaths, as well as other medical problems, as a result of
the accident that has already killed 31 people.
   ``I believe a healthy discussion ranging from no effects to
millions of effects ... is good,'' he told the conference
participants.
   An explosion and fire at the No. 4 reactor of the plant exposed
thousands to high levels of radiation and released a cloud of
radioactive material that eventually circled the world.
   Gale said Wednesday that specialists calculated the Chernobyl
accident could add as many as 30,000 cancer deaths to the 600
million expected worldwide in the next 50 years.
   But he stressed the number was based on calculations only. He
said he thought that the projections were high, perhaps even 10
times too high.
   Soviet scientists say they are dealing with a widespread fear
among their citizens about the dangers of nuclear power that they
have termed ``radiophobia,'' and they complain that forecasts like
Gale's contribute to it and threaten the future of the Soviet
nuclear power industry.
   The scientists also acknowledged that rumors of another accident
at the Chernobyl plant sometimes spread around the region.
   Viktor Knizhnikov, head of a Soviet radiation safety laboratory,
said Gale's initial projections of Chernobyl's health consequences,
made on Soviet television after the accident, ``contributed to
anxiety of the people.''
   On Wednesday, Leonid Ilyin, director of the Soviet Institute of
Biophysics, said rejection of nuclear power reflects a ``lack of
understanding of reality of today, when there is no alternative.''
But Gale said the way to control the fear of nuclear power is to
prevent nuclear accidents and nuclear war.
   Soviet nuclear power officials, who were severely criticized in
the West for not providing more timely information about the
Chernobyl accident, also are reeling from sharp criticism published
April 24 in the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   For months, official Soviet publications had nothing but praise
for the cleanup effort at Chernobyl. But Pravda said the plant was
plagued by poor workmanship, nepotism and drunkenness.
   Officials said Friday that some of the criticism was true of
work in the 18-mile exclusion zone around the plant, but not in the
plant itself.
   In another development, a government spokesman said Friday that
the head of a commission that investigated the accident committed
suicide a day after the second anniversary of the disaster.
   The April 27 death of Valery A. Legasov, 52, was unrelated to
his work, said Alexander P. Kovalenko, information hief of the
government agency overseeing the power station in the northern
Ukraine.
   ``Why, only he knew,'' Kovalenko told reporters visiting agency
headquarters. ``His suicide depended on psychology. We should not
connect it with work.''
   Legasov had been praised for his openness in discussing the
accident's causes and effects.
