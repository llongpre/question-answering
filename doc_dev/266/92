<F P=106> [By Amanda Brown, Health Correspondent, PA News] </F>
  [Text] An early warning system aimed at identifying a 
nuclear accident abroad was unveiled today - the eighth 
anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Rimnet, the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network, can 
identify raised levels of nuclear fall-out, enabling UK-based 
emergency services to spring into action. 
  Environment Minister Robert Atkins told a London news 
conference: "Any significant increase in radiation levels 
detected by the monitors will raise an alert on the Rimnet 
system and trigger alarms in continuously manned offices at my 
department." 
  "If Rimnet had been operating at the time of the Chernobyl 
accident, it would have indicated clearly where levels of 
radioactivity in the UK rose above normal background variations." 
  The system, which has monitoring stations across the 
country, 
can track radiation clouds by using sophisticated data and 
mapping equipment, while Government departments could alert 
water companies, local authorities and firms in the event of an 
accident. 
  The system will record measurements of radioactivity levels 
in air, water, food and people and store them on a database.
