   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made his first visit
to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant Thursday and indicated to a
worried Soviet public that he will take a cautious approach to
nuclear power.
   Official Soviet television showed Gorbachev, dressed in a white
robe and hat, touring the site in the Ukraine of the world's worst
nuclear power accident.
   He quizzed workers and officials about its safety, and both the
Soviet president and workers made reference to a previously
unreported incident in which safety equipment automatically shut
down one of the three reactors that still are operated at the plant.
   No details were provided, but technicians said the shutdown
reactor was undergoing repair while Gorbachev was there. The plant
director, Mikhail Umanets, said it would be restarted Friday morning.
   Earlier, plant spokesman Yuri Risovany said in a telephone
interview that three reactors were running during Gorbachev's visit.
The damaged No. 4 reactor, encased in a steel-and-concrete shell,
does not operate.
   Later, at a meeting with nuclear power officials, Gorbachev said
that in making decisions about present and future atomic power
stations, the Soviet Union would be ``strictly guided by scientific
data which should contain the replies to all questions _ technical,
security, ecology, social, and so on.''
   On Monday, the first day of his visit to the Ukraine, Gorbachev
told an elderly woman that officials will consider earthquake safety
before deciding whether to finish a nuclear power plant in Crimea, a
popular vacation area on the Black Sea.
   ``One shouldn't play around in these matters,'' Gorbachev said
Monday. ``It's serious. Don't think we want to trick anyone. We
would only back ourselves into a corner.''
   Officials already have said they will shut down a nuclear plant
in Armenia, where an earthquake killed 25,000 people in December.
   Gorbachev's visit to Chernobyl was symbolic because after the
accident in April 1986 the Soviet public became much more critical
of nuclear power. The Chernobyl accident killed at least 31 people
and released a radioactive cloud that eventually circled the globe.
   Nuclear power officials and plant workers who met with Gorbachev
before the TV cameras told him that the Chernobyl plant is now safe,
that nuclear power is the most reliable form of electricity, and
that the Soviet economy needs it.
   Gorbachev listened soberly, asking detailed questions about
safety procedures and equipment at the Chernobyl plant, which is 80
miles north of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.
   In December, Nuclear Power Minister Nikolai Lukonin said six
plants or planned additions to existing stations were scrapped
because of fears of earthquake damage or tougher construction
standards imposed after Chernobyl.
   At the same time, reports have increased about health problems
associated with the Chernobyl accident. The weekly Moscow News
reported last week that cancer cases have doubled and that calves
often are born without heads and limbs in a region of the Ukraine
within 30 miles of the plant.
