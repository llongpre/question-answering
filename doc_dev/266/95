   The United States, Italy, Belgium and Spain have
agreed to help set up a medical center in the region hit hardest by
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, Tass reported Sunday.
   The center will be built in Gomel, in the region of the
Byelorussian republic hit by 70 percent of the radioactive fallout
from the power plant accident, the news agency reported.
   Officials hope to build similar centers in other regions as
well.
   Soviet media have said more than 2 million Byelorussians are
living on contaminated land. The Byelorussian legislature has
declared the republic a ``national ecological disaster zone'' and
has halted shipments of food and vehicles to other regions because
they are contaminated.
   Workers in Gomel have held protest strikes demanding more aid
and better handling of the cleanup.
   Many Chernobyl-area residents have complained of inadequate
medical care. Cases of anemia, leukemia and cancers have been
reported rising among people living on contaminated land. Many
residents still eat food from that land because alternatives are
not available.
   The medical center will allow physicians to give residents
``continuous medical observation and ... highly skilled medical aid
on an international level,'' Tass reported. Complex operations will
be performed at the center, including bone marrow transplants, it
said.
   The countries will sign a final agreement on the center ``soon''
and construction should be completed in 1992, Tass said. It said
the Soviet Union will contribute $50,000 to the project, but did
not say what the other countries would contribute and gave no other
details about the agreement.
   Official reports say 31 people were killed in the April 26, 1986
accident at the nuclear power plant in the Urkaine, but others say
the number is much higher. Tass gave no new details about the
number of victims.
