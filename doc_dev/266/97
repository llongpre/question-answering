   An official of the Chernobyl nuclear plant
says he would like to see a joint U.S.-Soviet reactor built to help
prevent future accidents.
   ``I think that only by joint efforts can we create a new, modern
type of reactor which could exclude the negative impact on the
environment and exclude the possibility of such accidents which
happened at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl,'' Mikhail Borisyuk,
deputy secretary of Chernobyl, said in an interview Friday.
   Borisyuk is one of 10 Soviets and 11 Americans on the Global
Environment Commission of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit,
a weeklong gathering of more than 340 Americans and Soviets that
began Thursday.
   The delegates spent much of Saturday watching the Army-Navy
football game at Veterans Stadium and visiting the Liberty Bell and
Independence Hall.
   Ilona Zheleznyako, 30, a housing construction engineer from
Tinda, Siberia, touched the historic bell, which rang in July 1776
to announce the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. She
said she felt ``a good feeling of freedom and liberty.''
   Sergei Chelnokov, 34, said he was impressed with the longevity of
the U.S. Constitution.
   ``In our country ,there is a rethinking of some of the ideas of
our revolution, and we are now reconstructing a society which is
only 70 years old,'' he said. ``So it is amazing that something that
is three times as old is still working.''
   The summit is focused on private meetings of 16 commissions
assigned areas of discussion such as the environment, military
affairs, religion, science, business, the media and the arts.
   The Global Environment Commission will look at such topics as
global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, ocean waste, economic
development and international agreements.
   The conference comes as the Soviet Union has begun re-examining
conservation practices and giving citizens a greater voice in
environmental protection.
   The 1986 explosion and fire at Chernobyl was the world's worst
nuclear accident. It killed at least 33 people, sent a radioactive
cloud around the globe and made an area within a 40-mile radius of
the plant uninhabitable.
   At Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island reactor, equipment failures
and human error led to a loss of coolant and partial core meltdown
in 1979.
   ``The main lesson is the imperfection of technology that is used
at atomic power plants both in the United States and in the
U.S.S.R., and also imperfection of personnel training,'' Borisyuk
said.
   He said he believes nuclear energy remains the safest and
least-polluting form of energy, if properly managed.
