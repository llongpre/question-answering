At Nuclear Plants Because of Chernobyl

   Soviet officials said they're planning more safety changes on nuclear power plants because of last year's Chernobyl accident. 

   Some Western nuclear specialists, however, called the measures inadequate. 

   At a nuclear power conference here, Soviet officials said the additional measures will prevent accidents at the 14 other Chernobyl-type reactors currently operating in the Soviet Union. 
The changes, in plant design and emergency systems, would make the nuclear chain reactions supplying a plant's power less prone to go out of control. 
The modifications also would let plant operators shut down the reactors more quickly in emergencies, according to the Soviet officials. 

   The measures follow a series of other steps Moscow ordered on Chernobyl-type reactors shortly after the April 26, 1986, accident -- the most harmful in the history of nuclear power. 

   The changes since then mark a sharp departure from Moscow's pre-accident stance that touted Soviet reactor designs as nearly flawless. 
For example, Moscow didn't apply many of the safety measures adopted throughout the West after the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear-plant accident in the U.S. 

   Chernobyl presents "a lesson for all of us" in the East and West, Nikolai Ponomarev-Stepnoy, first deputy director of the Soviet Union's Kurchatov Institute for Atomic Energy, said in a conference lecture. 

   "The complex (nuclear) technologies we're using now don't forgive any kind of sloppy approach." 

   But some Western government and nuclear industry officials at the conference, sponsored by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, said Chernobyl-type reactors -- called RBMK's after their Russian acronymn -- need even more changes to make them safe. 

   "I wouldn't want a RBMK in my backyard," said Walter Loewenstein, deputy nuclear power director of the Electric Power Research Institute, a U.S. industry group. 

   The Chernobyl accident happened during a test that the Ukrainian plant's operators were performing on the reactor's safety systems. 
Because of safety design flaws and a series of operator mistakes and plant-rule violations, the Chernobyl staff lost control of the reactor. 
Its roof blew off and the reactor spewed radioactivity for nine days. 

   Mr. Loewenstein and others said Chernobyl-style reactors would be safer if they had Western-style "containment" buildings. 
Other Western specialists suggested strengthening welded joints in a reactor's coolant plumbing. 

   Some of the new measures unveiled by the Soviets yesterday seek to solve a previously recognized problem. 
The RBMK reactor, a unique Soviet design that runs more cheaply than Western plants, can develop a runaway nuclear reaction when it operates at low power. 
Officials are now working to bolster earlier efforts to run the plants more safely at low power. 

   Another planned change is to lengthen the reactors' control rods. 
When inserted into the reactor, these rods slow or stop the nuclear reaction. 

   But the Soviet Union isn't likely to quickly adopt additional improvements advocated by Western scientists. 
One apparent reason is the high cost of such changes, which already haved added more than 10% to the country's nuclear power costs.
