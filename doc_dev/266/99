   Three years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
cancer rates have doubled among residents of a contaminated farm
region and calves are being born without heads and limbs, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
   ``My daughter recently got married. What kind of grandson will I
have?'' the weekly Moscow news quoted one woman as saying.
   It said authorities drastically underestimated the health
problems caused by the reactor explosion and fire April 26, 1986,
which sent a cloud of radiation around the world.
   Moscow News said more than half the children in the Narodichsky
region of the Ukraine have illnesses of the thyroid gland, which
exposure to radiation can cause.
   Elevated levels of cesium 137 were detected among many residents
of the region, an agriculturally rich area which is within 30 miles
of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and was not evacuated after the
accident. Thirty-one people died as the immediate result of the
disaster.
   ``Health officials of the republic insist there is no health
danger for people outside a 30-kilometer (19-mile) zone around the
atomic power station,'' Moscow News said. The danger zone was
declared soon after the accident.
   Soviet officials have said repeatedly that radiation levels are
safe except in the zone, and generally have discounted warnings from
some Western doctors of dramatic increases to come in cancer and
some other diseases.
   The Moscow News article was the second in the Soviet press this
month to suggest growing health problems because of Chernobyl.
   In a report Feb. 9, the official news agency Tass said cancer and
other diseases are increasing in Byelorussia, which is just north of
the Ukraine. Tass said authorities determined one-fifth of the
Byelorussian republic was contaminated.
   Moscow News said lip, mouth and other cancers doubled among
residents of the Narodichsky region since the accident.
   It quoted veterinarian Peter Kudin of the Petrovsky Animal Farm
as saying 37 pigs and 27 calves were born with defects in the year
after Chernobyl and the numbers for the first nine months of 1988
were 41 and 35.
   ``The calves (were) frequently without heads, limbs, eyes or
ribs, the pigs goggle-eyed or with deformed skulls,'' he said. Kudin
said only three defective pigs were born at the farm before the
accident and no abnormal calves.
   According to Moscow news, animals at the farm had been feeding on
fields to which winds had carried radioactive particles.
   ``Clean'' meat and dairy products are brought to the region for
residents, but some who ignore warnings drink milk from local cows
and pick fruit and vegetables from their gardens, the newspaper said.
   Vladimir Kolinko, the Moscow News correspondent who wrote the
article, said if the government is serious about its pledges to make
things right, residents ``would have the right to demand ... full
compensation ... not to mention the right to full information about
people's health and the condition of the land.''
