   Spanish novelist and essayist Camilo
Jose Cela, who used the horrors of the Spanish Civil War to infuse
his work with an often grotesque and violent imagery, today won the
Nobel Prize in literature.
   Cela, 73, was cited by the Swedish Academy for his ``rich and
intensive prose, which with restrained compassion forms a
challenging vision of man's vulnerability.''
   Cela was the fifth Spaniard to win the Nobel Prize in
literature. He said he felt he shared the award with many other
Spanish and Latin American writers.
   ``For me this is something I`m very proud of,'' Cela told
Spanish National Radio from his home in Guadalajara, Spain. ``I
offer it to all of literature in Spanish. I believe that other
authors, Spanish and Latin American, who write in Spanish could
also have won it for the same reasons as I, but, in the end, I won
it, and I'm very, very happy.''
   Cela's best known work is the 1942 novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duarte,'' in which he created a new literary style known as
``tremendismo,'' emphasizing violence and grotesque imagery.
   The novel, a first-person account of a murderer awaiting
execution, was banned in Spain but established Cela's reputation as
a writer. It was considered the most important postwar novel and
set a new direction for Spanish literature toward concise and sober
writing.
   Cela's masterpiece is considered ``The Hive,'' from 1951, which
captures three days in the life of Madrid four years after the
civil war.
   Cela has written 10 novels among his 70 works of travelogs,
short stories and poetry.
   The Swedish Academy called him ``the leading figure in Spain's
literary renewal during the postwar era.''
   ``Cela is a restless spirit,'' who often expresses himself ``in
an old Spanish tradition of hilarious grotesqueness,'' it said.
   Sture Allen, the Academy's secretary, called Cela ``provocative
and innovative'' in both his form and subject matter.
   ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' was probably the most widely
read Spanish novel since ``Don Quixote,'' the Academy said. It also
singled out as ``a sensation'' his 1969 novel ``San Camilo,'' which
describes the weeks before the outbreak of civil war.
   Cela was the first Spaniard to win the Nobel since 1977, when it
was awarded to poet Vicente Aleixandre. Cela was chosen from about
150 candidates, Allen said. The prize this year is worth about
$463,000.
   As publisher of the literary magazine ``Papeles de Son
Armadans'' from 1956 to 1979, Cela also was credited for providing
a forum for young opposition writers during the ``years of
hardship,'' a reference to the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   His writing ``broadened the range of Spanish writing'' and
widely influenced Latin American literature, Allen said after
reading the citation to reporters at the Academy's 18th century
headquarters.
   Cela was born May 11, 1916, in the town of Iria Flavia to a
middle class family that counted among its forebearers both Spanish
aristocrats and English pirates.
   His medical studies were interrupted by the 1936-39 Civil War.
Suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, he returned to his native
Galicia district, which was controlled by Franco's Nationalists.
Forced to join the Nationalists as a private, he was seriously
wounded.
   After the war he began studying law in Madrid but devoted much
of his time to writing. He turned to writing full time after
producing ``The Family of Pascual Duarte.''
   In 1977, King Juan Carlos appointed Cela a senator in the first
Spanish Parliament, and he assisted in writing the Spanish
Constitution in 1978.
   He received the 1987 Prince of Asturias Award for Literature,
given by a foundation named for the heir to the Spanish throne, and
has been a member of the Spanish Academy literary group since 1957.
   Other well-known works by Cela include ``Journey to the
Alcarria'' from 1948, a diary of his walking trip through rural
Castille, and ``Jews, Moors and Christians'' from 1956, an essay of
the impact of religion on Spanish history.
   The Nobel Prize in literature was the last of the six prizes to
be awarded for 1989. All were worth $463,000 this year.
   The Nobel Peace Prize was given to the Dalai Lama, the exiled
spiritual and political leader of Tibet, for his non-violent
struggle to free his Himalayan nation from Chinese rule.
   The prize in medicine went to J. Michael Bishop and Harold E.
Varmus of the United States for their discovery of a family of
genes that helped scientists better understand how cancer develops.
   Trygve Haavelmo of Norway won the prize in economics for showing
that mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the
puzzling shifts in the economy.
   American Thomas Cech and Canadian-born Sidney Altman, a U.S.
citizen since 1984, won the chemistry prize for their work with the
genetic material RNA. The physics prize was awarded to American
Norman F. Ramsey for the atomic clock used as the international
time standard and to American Hans G. Dehmelt and West German
Wolfgang Paul for a method to isolate single atoms.
   The prizes were first given in 1901 from the estate of Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.
