   Novelist Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt, who
chronicled man's search for values in stories set from the Nile
delta of the pharaohs to the busy streets of modern Cairo, today
won the 1988 Nobel Prize for literature.
   The 76-year-old retired civil servant, who once had his work
banned in his native country, was the first Arabic-language writer
to win the award.
   ``I am happy, extremely happy, for myself and for Arab
literature,'' Mahfouz was quoted as saying by the government's
Middle East News Agency in Cairo.
   ``I remember at this moment my professors, Egyptian writers who
deserved this prize before me. ... It was a complete surprise
because I had no idea I was even nominated to win it,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The 18-member Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, cited
Mahfouz as an author ``who, through works rich in nuance _ now
clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous _ has formed
an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.''
   Mahfouz, a self-effacing coffeeshop habitue, produced a
half-century of literature. The academy said his work ``has meant a
powerful upswing for the novel as a genre and for the development
of the literary language in Arabic-speaking cultural circles.''
   ``The range is, however, greater than that. His work speaks to
us all,'' it said.
   Publishers and cultural page writers had urged that the academy
give this year's prize to someone other than a male from Europe or
the United States. The 87-year-old prize carries a $390,000 cash
prize.
   Speculation had included South African novelist and apartheid
critic Nadine Gordimer; American author Joyce Carol Oates; V.S.
Naipaul, a writer of Indian origin; and the perennially mentioned
Graham Greene of Britain.
   Last year's winner was exiled Soviet poet Joseph Brodsky.
   Sture Allen, the academy's secretary, said no one in the academy
read Mahfouz's works in the original Arabic. He declined to say
whether the decision was unanimous, but said the Egyptian writer
was one of five on the final list.
   Mahfouz set his early novels in the time of the pharaohs, but
his later works move to the crowded alleys of modern Cairo, said
the academy.
   Mahfouz, who spends an hour each day in bazaar coffee shops,
once said he considered his writing ``probably ... fourth or fifth
rate.''
   Although he ranks among Egypt's most popular writers, Mahfouz's
realistic, almost Dickensian portrayals of the wretched conditions
under which his country's poor live have made his popularity less
than unanimous.
   His 1967 novel, ``Miramar,'' attacked then-President Gamal Abdel
Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist policies. The characters _ guests
at an Alexandria hotel _ pay lip service to the ideals of
revolution while privately holding them in contempt.
   The academy singled out Mahfouz's 1959 work ``Children of
Gebelawi,'' which was banned in his own country.
   The book's characters were based on Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus,
Mohammed and a modern scientist.
   The academy described the work as ``an allegory of humanity's
historic destiny under the great monotheistic founders of
religion.''
   Arabic has between 150 and 200 million native speakers, but they
are concentrated in about 21 countries, many with small literate
populations.
   His major work was the Trilogy, completed in 1957, a 1,500-page
semi-autobiographical work.
   Twelve of Mahfouz's 40 novels or volumes of stories have been
translated into English, and a smaller number have been published
in German, French and Swedish.
   He also has written short stories, plays and more than 30 film
scripts based on his novels.
   Mahfouz worked in culture-related posts for the Egyptian
government until his retirement in 1971.
   His first novels were written at a time of nationalist foment in
Egypt before the 1952 revolution led by Nasser, who died in 1970.
The academy said these novels, set in ancient Egypt, were ``social
utopias written from the need of national identity.''
   The literature prize, begun in 1901, is one of five established
by the estate of Alfred Nobel, who left a fortune from his
invention and marketing of explosives. A sixth, the economics
prize, was added by the Bank of Sweden in 1968.
   Other Nobel prizes will be announced next week: medicine on
Monday, economics on Tuesday, and physics and chemistry on
Wednesday. The peace prize was given Sept. 29 to the U.N.
peacekeeping forces.
