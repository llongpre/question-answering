   The Nobel Peace Prize, which will be
worth $455,000 this year, is to be announced Oct. 5, launching the
1989 Nobel season, officials said today.
   The Baltic nationalist movements and the founder of an
Israeli-Palestinian peace village were known to be among some 100
nominations received by the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian
parliament.
   The Nobel Committee never discloses the names of the candidates,
but those nominating sometimes make their choice public.
   The Peace Prize announcement in Oslo, Norway, will be followed by
the Stockholm announcement of the Nobel prize for medicine on Oct. 9.
   The winner of the economics prize will announced in Stockholm on
Oct. 11, and the winners of the prizes for physics and chemistry
will be announced on Oct. 12, officials said.
   The Swedish Academy, which awards the literary prize,
traditionally keeps the date of its announcement confidential until
a few days in advance. That prize is always announced on a Thursday.
   The prizes will be awarded in ceremonies in Oslo and Stockholm on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1895 death of benefactor Alfred
Nobel.
