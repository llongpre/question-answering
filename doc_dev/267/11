   Unlike Spain's four other Nobel laureates
in literature, Camilo Jose Cela is a public figure, better known as
a bon vivant than for his 10 novels and other writings.
   His best-known novels, ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' (1942)
and ``The Hive'' (1951), have been made into successful movies, and
many Spaniards have encountered the author during his trips through
the country in a Rolls Royce.
   Cela, 73, most recently made news with the public disclosure of
a romantic liaison with Marina Castano, a woman half his age who is
his muse and literary aide.
   He is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years and
has a son, Camilo Jose Cela, who said last week that having such a
flamboyant father was difficult.
   His wife, Rosario Conde, said Thursday from her home in Palma de
Majorca the prize was well deserved and she would accompany her
husband to the awards ceremony in Stockholm. She added: ``If I
don't go, there's no prize.''
   Before he rushed off to a weekly television talk show appearance
Thursday, the Nobel laureate and Ms. Castano spoke with reporters
over a quick lunch at a Madrid hotel. She said he still writes
everything in longhand and has no idea how to operate a typewriter
or word processor.
   Cela, who has produced 70 works that include essays, poems and
travel books, said he was ``not really surprised'' by the award and
the prize could just as well have gone to many other Spanish
writers.
   ``But life is like a game of tennis, and this time I won,'' he
said, adding that the $463,000 prize would ``come in very handy.''
   ``I'll use it to pay my debts, and believe me, I've got a lot of
them,'' he said.
   Andreu Teixedor of Editorial Destino, which publishes Cela's
work in Spanish, said ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' had sold
more than 1 million copies in Spain and Latin America.
   In the 47 years since ``Pascual Duarte,'' Cela said Thursday,
``what I have gained in wisdom I've been losing in vigor and
health, and what I have gained in experience I've lost in
freshness.''
   Using the crude language common to his fiction, Cela said he
would like this epitaph: ``Here lies someone who tried to screw his
fellow man as little as possible.''
   The author said Spain, which produced ``Don Quixote,'' had been
overshadowed in literature by Latin America because of the
country's ``foolish provincialism.''
   ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' often is credited with creating
a sort of literary vanguard in the years immediately after the
civil war of 1936-39. It was published first in Argentina because
it was deemed too violent and crude for the Spain of Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   It is the tale, told in graphic language, of a rude man from the
country who commits a series of brutal murders without really
knowing why and eventually is executed by garrote.
   His novel ``The Hive'' is set in the years just after the war,
when the rest of the world was fighting. It tells of struggling
writers who sit for hours during the winter in Madrid's tolerant,
well-heated literary cafes, nursing a cup of imitation coffee and
trying to keep culture alive.
   Cela, the first Spanish novelist to win the Nobel, said Thursday
he had a work in progress, but he would not describe it.
   ``You never really know how these things are going to turn out
until the end,'' he said.
   Spanish poet Juan Ramon Jimenez won the Nobel literature prize
in 1956 and in 1977, two years after Franco died, it went to
Vicente Aleixandre, an obscure poet. The nation's first literary
laureate was playwright Jose Echegaray in 1904 and another
playwright, Jacinto Benavente, won in 1922.
