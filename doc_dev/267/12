   With horns trumpeting in salute, King
Carl XVI Gustaf on Sunday presented the gold medallions of the
Nobel Prize to nine laureates from the United States, West German,
Norway and Spain.
   The winners were applauded as they received the medals. They
bowed to the king, members of the selection committee, and an
invited audience of about 400 at the white-tie ceremony. Later,
they were honored at a banquet in the City Hall ballroom.
   In Oslo, Norway, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Dalai
Lama in a ceremony attended by Norwegian King Olav V and government
officials. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after an uprising
against the Chinese occupation failed. He is living in exile in
India.
   The Stockholm honors, a highlight of Sweden's social calendar,
were broadcast on national television. Each prize was worth
$469,000, which was divided in those categories where there was
more than one winner.
   At the Stockholm banquet, Camilo Jose Cela of Spain, who won the
Nobel Prize for literature, offered a toast to world peace and
other laureates expressed hope for greater intellectual freedom.
   Americans J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus won the Nobel
Prize for medicine; Americans Norman F. Ramsey and Hans G. Dehmelt
and Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for physics; Americans Sidney
Altman and Thomas R. Cech for chemistry, and Trygve Haavelmo of
Norway for economics.
   Varmus, of the University of California at San Francisco, cited
the 8th century English poem Beowulf in his remarks about
scientific challenges.
   ``We recognize that, unlike Beowulf, we have not slaughtered the
cancer cell, we have only seen our enemy more clearly,'' he said.
   Varmus and Bishop shared the prize for their work with
oncogenes, dealing with how some tumors develop.
   Asked later by an interviewer about the chance of finding a
vaccine for the common cold, Varmus replied: ``My personal advice,
and the kind of therapy I practiced today, was to go running in the
snow, take a sauna and jump into a cold pond.''
   Altman of Yale University, also speaking for fellow laureate
Cech of the University of Colorado, said he hoped scientists and
intellectuals around the world would gain the freedom of thought
enjoyed in the United States.
   They received the prize for discovering catalytic properties in
the genetic material RNA.
   Ramsey was honored as a developer of the atomic clock and the
other physics winners, Paul and Dehmelt, were named for developing
tools to trap and study single atoms or ions.
   Haavelmo accepted the economics prize for developing theories of
econometrics.
   Cela is the author of the 1942 novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duarte.'' He said he accepted the prize on behalf of ``those who
have the glorious Spanish language for their own.''
