   The Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, today welcomed Eastern Europe's non-violent revolution and
hoped for the day when his homeland of Tibet would celebrate its
own triumph over Chinese occupation.
   China today lodged a protest with Norway over Sunday's
presentation of the award to the Tibetan spiritual leader and said
the official Norwegian participation would ``greatly impair''
relations.
   In a separate ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, on Sunday, King
Carl XVI Gustaf awarded gold Nobel medallions to nine laureates who
won the prizes for literature, chemistry, physics, medicine and
economic sciences. Six were Americans.
   In keeping with tradition, the peace prize winner gives a
lecture at the University of Olso.
   The Dalai Lama said in a text prepared for today's lecture that
``the awarding of the Nobel Prize to me, a simple monk from
far-away Tibet, here in Norway, also fills us Tibetans with hope.''
   The exiled leader then said he wanted to speak about human
understanding, compassion and love ``instead of reading my speech.''
   His one-hour impromptu talk concentrated on moral and ethical
questions illustrated with homilies that often provoked laughter
from the audience of 600.
   The Dalai Lama said he will use the $469,000 peace prize to help
starving people, lepers in India, various peace programs and to
establish the Tibetan Foundation for Universal Responsibility.
   At Sunday's ceremony attended by Norwegian King Olav V and other
government officials, he said China's rejection of his 1987 peace
plan was forcing him to rethink his approach and that he might
withdraw his proposal.
   But, he added: ``Our struggle must remain non-violent and free
of hatred.''
   ``I accept the prize with profound gratitude on behalf of the
oppressed everywhere and for all those who struggle for freedom and
work for world peace,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama, 54, was chosen at age 5 as the reincarnation of
Tibet's god-king, making him religious and political head of the
isolated mountain nation. He fled into exile in India after a
failed uprising in 1959. China has ruled Tibet for 40 years.
   The Dalai Lama has called for Tibetan autonomy over domestic
matters, with China retaining control over military and diplomatic
affairs. Beijing has rejected the formula.
   The Dalai Lama said the Chinese had ``become even more
repressive'' since the announcement in October that he was
receiving the peace prize. He said several Tibetans were sentenced
to up to 19 years in prison last week, ``possibly ... to intimidate
the population before today's event.''
   ``China cannot escape the impact of this spirit of freedom
sweeping many parts of the world,'' he said, citing the political
changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   In Beijing, the official Xinhua News Agency said an unidentified
official of the Foreign Ministry lodged a protest in a meeting with
Norway's Ambassador to China, Jan Tore Holvik.
   The official said the presence of Norwegian leaders at the award
ceremony ``constituted an open support to the Dalai clique's
activities aimed at splitting China and a gross interference in
China's internal affairs.''
   The Dalai Lama was the 70th recipient since the first peace
prizes were awarded in 1901 from the estate of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish inventor of dynamite.
   Spanish writer Camilo Jose Cela received the prize for
literature.
   Americans J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus won the Nobel
Prize for medicine; Americans Norman F. Ramsey and Hans G. Dehmelt
and Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for physics; Americans Sidney
Altman and Thomas R. Cech for chemistry, and Trygve Haavelmo of
Norway for economics.
   The Stockholm honors, a highlight of Sweden's social calendar,
were broadcast on national television. Each prize was worth
$469,000, which was divided in those categories where there was
more than one winner.
   Cela is the author of the 1942 novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duarte.'' He said he accepted the prize on behalf of ``those who
have the glorious Spanish language for their own.''
   Varmus, of the University of California at San Francisco, cited
the 8th century English poem Beowulf in his remarks about
scientific challenges.
   ``We recognize that, unlike Beowulf, we have not slaughtered the
cancer cell, we have only seen our enemy more clearly,'' he said.
   Varmus and Bishop shared the prize for their work with
oncogenes, dealing with how some tumors develop.
   Altman of Yale University, also speaking for fellow laureate
Cech of the University of Colorado, said he hoped scientists and
intellectuals around the world would gain the freedom of thought
enjoyed in the United States.
   They received the prize for discovering catalytic properties in
the genetic material RNA.
   Ramsey was honored as a developer of the atomic clock and the
other physics winners, Paul and Dehmelt, were named for developing
tools to trap and study single atoms or ions.
   Haavelmo accepted the economics prize for developing theories of
econometrics.
