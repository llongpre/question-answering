   An exiled Chinese poet was the focus of
the literary world today amid speculation the Swedish Academy would
award the Nobel Prize to a Chinese writer for the first time in its
89-year history.
   The academy was to make its final choice in a vote this morning
and make the announcement at the stroke of 1 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT).
   Bei Dao, whose somber short stories and poems have been praised
for their depiction of personal dramas entwined in the political
vicissitudes of Communist China, was said to be a strong candidates
for the $700,000 prize.
   Others said to be in the running were Gaelic novelist Seamus
Heaney, U.S. novelist Joyce Carol Oates, Mexican poet Octavio Paz,
Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado, West Indians V.S. Naipaul and Derek
Walcott, Turkey's Yasar Kemal, Margaret Atwood of Canada, South
African writer Nadine Gordimer and Japanese novelist Masuji Ibuse.
   The academy long has been criticized for ignoring China's
3,000-year-old literary tradition and giving short shrift to Asia
as a whole.
   There have only been two Asian winners in the history of the
prize, first given in 1901. Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore won the
Nobel in 1913 and Japanese writer Yasunaro Kawabata was chosen in
1968.
   Sweden, by comparison, has had six laureates.
   The addition of Chinese language professor Goran Malmqvist to
the 18-member academy in 1985 has put the board in a position to
assess original writings from the Chinese.
   Bei Dao was born in 1949, the year the Communists came to power
in China.
   He entered adulthood during the Cultural Revolution, which
lasted from 1966 to 1976, and Bei's interpreters say the feeling of
terror that pervades much of his poetry can be linked to the
violence of this period.
   Bei was a guiding voice for young Chinese writers during a
period of greater democracy in China from 1976-79.
   In February 1989, he helped organize a petition seeking the
release of political prisoners. He left China for a conference two
months later, just as the pro-democracy movement began in Beijing.
   Bei never returned and currently teaches Chinese at the
University of Aarhus in Denmark.
   Sources say Bei was a strong candidate for the prize last year.
But some writers have been rumored to be on the ``short list'' for
years.
   Female writers have rarely been awarded the prize.
German-Swedish poet Nelly Sachs, the last woman laureate, in 1966,
was only the sixth woman to win the prize.
   The prize was established in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish philanthropist and inventor of dynamite.
