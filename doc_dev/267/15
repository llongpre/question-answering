   The Swedish Academy, depleted by the
resignation of three members and under fire for some of its past
selections, will announce the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday.
   The academy has refused to accept last year's resignations of
Lars Gyllensten, Kerstin Ekman and Werner Aspenstrom, saying
members are named for life, and academy prestige would be shattered
if anyone were allowed to resign.
   None of the three took part in this year's deliberations, and it
is unclear whether their presence would have changed the decision.
   Gyllensten, 69, who had been with the 18-member academy for 23
years, and Ms. Ekman, at 57 its youngest member, quit to protest
the organization's reaction to Iranian death threats against
British author Salman Rushdie.
   They said the academy's general statement, condemning censorship
without referring specifically to Rushdie, was weak and politically
motivated.
   With them, the 204-year-old institution lost one of its most
knowledgeable members and one of only two women.
   Author Aspenstrom, 71, said his reasons for resigning were
different, but indicated support for a stronger statement on the
Rushdie case.
   ``The Rushdie-case was the last drop, but the crevice in trust
had been deepening for some years,'' Gyllensten said as the academy
made its final decision on who will win the 4 million kronor
($704,000) prize.
   Ms. Ekman said that if the more conservative majority continued
to regard expression of new opinions as a challenge to its power,
``the old institution'' would become sterile.
   Gyllensten has said the academy should become more active in the
issues being debated in modern literary circles.
   The academy has been pressured for years to award the prize to a
woman. Six female laureates have been chosen since the prize was
first awarded in 1901 under an endowment from Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish inventor of dynamite.
   Swedish-German writer Nelly Sachs was the last woman winner, in
1966.
   Nobel specified in his 1896 will that the prizes should be
awarded with no regard to nationality. The most frequent criticism
of the academy, however, has been that it focused on the
accomplishments of Western European and North American writers.
   The academy took steps in the last two decades to draw attention
to authors who write for a limited language group, but drew fire
for that, too.
   It selected an Arab-language writer, Naguib Mahfouz, for the
first time in 1988. Critics then noted that no Chinese writer has
ever been chosen, despite China's 3,000-year-old literary
tradition.
   The academy says it never considers politics. Its citations for
Mahfouz and for last year's winner, Spaniard Camilo Jose Cela, draw
attention, however, to works their governments had banned.
   British author Anthony Burgess has complained that the prize is
awarded on the strength of a single book, although the academy says
it is for the author's body of work.
   ``It is inevitably one novel that sticks in the jury's
collective brain,'' Burgess wrote in a magazine article this month.
``The wrong novel has consistently been chosen.''
   King Gustav III founded the academy in 1786 to protect and
promote Swedish language and literature. It has maintained a
tradition of grandeur and secrecy behind the 18th-century walls of
the Stock Exchange building in Stockholm's Old Town.
   Caj Lundgren, culture editor at the Svenska Dagbladet daily,
said the academy ``has always been the target of criticism, simply
because it's an ancient type of institution.
   ``It has been criticized for being old-fashioned and
stiff-legged and some may take . . . (the rift) as a kind of proof
for this. Others see it as a sign of life that members actually
protest and ask to leave.''
