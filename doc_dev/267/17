   The Swedish Academy will announce the
winner of the Nobel Prize for literature on Thursday.
   The exclusive 18-member academy of Sweden's leading writers and
critics said nothing about the candidates, although it is known to
have focused in recent years on authors from Third World countries.
   The tradition-bound academy, whose members are elected for life,
keeps secret the date of its announcement until a few days before
it happens. It always is made on a Thursday at precisely 1 p.m. (8
a.m. EDT) at the 18th century stock market building where the
academy occupies an upper story.
   Last year the prize went to exiled Soviet poet Joseph Brodsky.
   Other Nobel prizes awarded by the Royal Academy of Sciences will
be announced next week: the medicine prize on Monday, the economic
sciences prize on Tuesday, and the prizes for chemistry and physics
on Wednesday.
   The Nobel Peace Prize went to the United Nations peacekeeping
forces and was announced in the Norwegian capital of Oslo on Sept.
29.
   The Nobel laureates will receive their prizes in ceremonies in
Stockholm and Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of
Alfred Nobel.
