<LEADPARA>  A French physicist who devised a theory explaining the behavior of molecules
in many different substances and a Swiss chemist who invented one of the most
important analytical instruments used by chemists were awarded the Nobel
prizes in their fields today.;   Pierre-Gilles de Gennes of France, 58, won
for finding underlying similarities in the behavior of molecules in a wide
range of solid materials, from superconductors to the liquid crystals used in
calculator and wristwatch displays, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
in awarding him the $1 million Nobel Prize in physics.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Some of the systems de Gennes has treated have been so complicated that
few physicists had earlier thought it possible to incorporate them at all in a
general physical description," the academy said. Some of the academy's judges
called him "the Isaac Newton of our time.";   Richard R. Ernst of Switzerland,
58, won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to the development
of high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.;   The academy
said magnetic resonance spectroscopy has become one of the most important
analytic techniques in chemistry in the past 20 years. That is the result of
dramatic increases in the sensitivity of the technique, made possible by
Ernst's contributions, the academy said.;   De Gennes' mathematical
descriptions of crystals and long, chain-like molecules referred to as
polymers have broad applications, the academy said.;   De Gennes, of the
College de France in Paris, "has opened new fields in physics and stimulated a
great deal of theoretical and experimental work in these fields," the academy
said. "While this is pure research, it has also meant the laying of a more
solid foundation for the technical exploitation of the materials . . . liquid
crystals and polymers.";   De Gennes said he was pleased to win the prize on
behalf of the prestigious School of Physics and Chemistry in Paris, which he
has directed since 1976. He has had to struggle to retain adequate public
funding for the school. "The prize will give me arguments to defend my
school," he said.;   While much of his research has been theoretical, it was
done with an eye toward applications, de Gennes said. "All of my research,
however fundamental, is always motivated by practicality," he said. As an
example, he mentioned his recent work in the development of "super glues"
strong enough to be used to assemble airplanes.;   Pierre-Gilles de Gennes
(pronounced pee-EHR-zheel duh zhehn) began research on liquid crystals in
Orsay in the late 1960s. His groups quickly became one of the leading groups
in the field.;   The academy said de Gennes demonstrated important
similarities between the behavior of liquid crystals and that of
superconducters.;   The United States has dominated both Nobel science
categories since World War II. Americans make up 40 percent of the physics
prize winners and 31 percent of the chemistry laureates.;   The Nobel prizes
are to be presented in Oslo, Norway and Stockholm on Dec. 10, anniversary of
the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who endowed five of the
prizes in his 1896 will.;   The memorial economics prize, established in 1968
by the Bank of Sweden, was awarded Tuesday to American Ronald Coase.;  
Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Nadine Gordimer of South Africa won the literature prize, and German
scientists Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann shared the medicine prize.  </TEXT>
