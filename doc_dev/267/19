   Two Americans and a Canadian captured
the Nobel Prize in physics Wednesday for finding nature's smallest
known particle. An American won the Nobel in chemistry for
developing simpler ways to make complex chemicals.
   Americans Jerome I. Friedman and Henry W. Kendall and Canadian
Richard E. Taylor showed that protons and neutrons, once thought to
be fundamental particles, were made up of smaller components called
quarks. Quarks are now believed to be basic building blocks of
matter.
   American Elias James Corey won the prize in chemistry for
research that simplified the production of plastics and other
artificial fibers, paints and dyes, pesticides and drugs.
   ``This is a statistically improbable event,'' Corey said of
winning the award. ``There are so many scientists who are so
deserving.''
   He found out he had won when a student congratulated him in the
hallway.
   The Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards both prizes, said
Corey's work has ``contributed to the high standards of living and
health and the longevity enjoyed ... in the Western world.''
   Each prize is worth about $700,000.
   ``Here was a repetition, although at a deeper level, of one of
the most dramatic events in the history of physics, the discovery
of the nucleus of the atom,'' the academy said of the physics
laureates' work.
   ``Their experiments showed definitively that there were smaller
nuclear particles than protons and neutrons,'' said Professor
Cecelia Jareskog of the academy.
   In the future, she said, ``we will be able to see even finer
details. Maybe there is something inside the quark.''
   Friedman, 60, of Chicago, and Kendall, 63, of Boston are
professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Taylor,
60, born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, is a professor at Stanford
University.
   The discovery was made during research begun in 1967 at MIT and
Stanford using Stanford's linear accelerator, an ``atom smasher''
that produces high-speed collisions of sub-atomic particles in an
effort to discern their properties and structure.
   Friedman, reached in Fort Worth, Texas, said he was ``very, very
overwhelmed'' at winning the Nobel.
   He said the research began with a study of protons.
   ``To our surprise, we found that the scattering of electrons
from protons behaved in a way that suggested that there were
point-like objects inside, little nuggets inside. They were later
identified ... as being compatible with there being quarks,'' he
said.
   It was the first experimental evidence that quarks existed and
confirmed earlier theories, Friedman said.
   Asked the meaning of the research, he said it contributed to the
understanding of ``how nature works.''
   He added: ``One never knows what the application of basic
research will be. Knowing what the structure of matter is,
ultimately has to have some effect on how you model the entire
structure of things.''
   Taylor, contacted at home in Stanford, Calif., said he was
surprised to learn he had won the prize. ``It's a great honor,'' he
said.
   Taylor said he was most influenced by W.K.H. Panofsky, former
director of the Stanford Linear Acceleration Center. ``It was his
vision and hard work that generated the accelerator to do the
experiment,'' he said. ``I think of him as directly responsible.''
   Kendall said of winning the Nobel: ``I think the prize means
recognition for what has been an important experiment in physics.
It was done 20 years ago, so I found it delightful and
unexpected.''
   Kendall has been chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists
since 1973.
   Corey, 62, of Harvard University, has synthesized about 100
important drugs and other natural products, the academy said.
   Corey's method of synthesizing chemicals is called
retrosynthetic analysis. To make biological molecules in the
laboratory, he analyzes their structure and works backward to
identify simpler molecules he needs to construct them.
   ``It is one of the prerequisites of our civilization,'' the
academy said of Corey's work. The field has been rewarded with the
Nobel Prize seven times before.
   The Nobel prizes were endowed in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel,
the inventor of dynamite. The physics and chemistry prizes were the
last awarded this year.
   This week, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won the peace
prize and Americans Harry Markowitz, Merton Miller and William
Sharpe won the Nobel memorial prize in economics.
   Last week Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the prize in
literature and Americans Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall Thomas won
the prize for medicine.
   The prizes will be presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.
