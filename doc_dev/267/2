   Camilo Jose Cela, a Spanish writer
whose violent, grotesque images sprang from the civil war that
killed more than 1 million of his countrymen, won the Nobel Prize
for literature Thursday.
   The Swedish Academy cited Cela, 73, for ``rich and intensive
prose, which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision
of man's vulnerability.''
   It said his novel ``The Family of Pascual Duarte,'' published in
1942, was the most popular work of fiction in Spanish since Miguel
Cervantes' masterpiece ``Don Quixote'' was published nearly 400
years ago.
   ``I understand that this is the culmination of my literary
career after many years of work,'' Cela told Swedish radio from his
home in Guadalajara, 30 miles northeast of Madrid.
   ``I offer it to all of literature in Spanish. I believe that
other authors, Spanish and Latin American, who write in Spanish
could also have won it for the same reasons as I.''
   Cela, a bon vivant known in Spain for his flamboyant lifestyle,
told reporters over lunch in Madrid that ``life is like a game of
tennis, and this time I won.''
   He said he would use the $463,000 prize ``to pay my debts, and
believe me, I've got a lot of them.''
   In the 47 years since ``Pascual Duarte,'' Cela said, ``what I
have gained in wisdom I've been losing in vigor and health, and
what I have gained in experience I've lost in freshness.''
   As an epitaph, he said, he would like: ``Here lies someone who
tried to screw his fellow man as little as possible.''
   His 10 novels and 60 other works _ short stories, essays, poetry
and travel books _ have made Cela ``the leading figure in Spain's
literary renewal during the postwar era,'' the Swedish Academy
said. He is the fifth Spanish writer to receive the literature
prize.
   Sture Allen, the academy's secretary, said Cela also had wide
influence on literature throughout Latin America.
   ``He is an experimental and provocative writer, both regarding
form and contents,'' Allen said. ``Furthermore, he broadened the
range of the Spanish language.''
   Asked to compare Cela with another experimental Spanish writer,
Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru, Allen described both as individualists
who were ``apparently acquainted with each others' works.''
   Allen suggested that readers unfamiliar with Cela begin with
travel writings in which ``he tried to capture the Spain he saw
disappearing, and maybe some of the Spanish national spirit.''
   In ``The Family of Pascual Duarte,'' his best-known work, Cela
created a new style known as ``tremendismo'' that emphasized
violence and grotesque imagery. The novel, a first-person account
of a murderer awaiting execution, was banned in Spain but
established Cela's reputation as a writer.
   ``Requiem of Darkness 5'' (1973) and ``Mazurka for Two Dead''
(1983) carried Cela's experimental style further.
   His masterpiece is considered to be ``The Hive,'' published in
1951. It describes three days in the life of Madrid four years
after the civil war ended in 1939.
   The war, which lasted three years and brought Gen. Francisco
Franco to power, often played an important role in Cela's works.
   He is a native of Galicia, a Franco stronghold in northwestern
Spain. After returning from studies in Madrid with tuberculosis, he
was recruited by the fascists, suffered the horrors of war and was
sent home with serious wounds.
   Despite his service in the Franco forces, Cela was strongly
anti-fascist. From 1956 to 1979, he published Papeles de Son
Armadans, a magazine that became a forum for the young opposition.
Franco died in 1975.
   The author was born May 11, 1916, in the town of Ira Flavia to a
middle class family that counted among its forebearers both Spanish
aristocrats and English pirates.
   Before the civil war began in 1936, he studied medicine and law.
He turned to writing full-time after the success of ``The Family of
Pascual Duarte.''
   In 1977, King Juan Carlos appointed Cela to a Senate seat in the
first post-Franco parliament, and he participated the next year in
writing a new constitution.
   He received the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature in 1987
and has been a member of the Spanish Academy literary group since
1957.
   Cela is the first Spaniard to win the literature prize since the
poet Vicente Aleixandre in 1977 and the first Spanish-language
writer since Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Colombia in 1982. The other
winners from Spain were poet Juan Ramon Jimenez in 1956 and
playwrights Jose Echegaray and Jacinto Benavente in 1904 and 1922.
   The Nobel Prize in literature was the last of the six prizes
awarded for 1989, each worth $463,000.
   The Dalai Lama, exiled spiritual and political leader of Tibet,
won the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Other winners were J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus of the
United States, medicine; Trygve Haavelmo of Norway, economics;
Thomas Cech, an American, and Canadian-born Sidney Altman, a U.S.
citizen since 1984, chemistry; Norman F. Ramsey and Hans G.
Dehmelt, both Americans, and Wolfgang Paul, West German, physics.
   Alfred Nobel of Sweden, who invented dynamite and made a
fortune, provided for the prizes in his will. The first awards were
made in 1901.
