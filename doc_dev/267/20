TONI MORRISON, the American novelist, yesterday became the first
African-American and only the eighth woman to win the Nobel prize for
literature.
The Swedish Academy of Sciences, which since 1901 has awarded the annual
prizes bequeathed by industrialist Alfred Nobel, said Ms Morrison's work,
mainly concerned with racism in the US, depicted the lives of 'blacks as the
people they are'.
Through novels 'characterised by visionary force and poetic import (she)
gives life to an essential aspect of American reality', the academy said. Ms
Morrison, professor of humanities at Princeton, was a surprise choice
because the prize had gone to writers in English in the previous two years.
The West Indian poet Derek Walcott won last year, preceded by Nadine
Gordimer, the South African novelist.
Ms Morrison, 62, is the 10th American to win the prestigious prize, worth
SKr6.7m (Pounds 553,000). In a statement issued by her US publishers, she
said: 'I am unendurably happy. I, of course, am profoundly honoured. The
most wonderful thing for me personally is to know that the prize has at last
been awarded to an African-American.'
A teacher of literature, Ms Morrison has written six novels and a number of
essays in which the themes of racism, slavery and segregation are often
conveyed in violent images. Her novel Beloved, published in 1987, won a
Pulitzer prize. The Nobel judges said Ms Morrison, born Chloe Anthony
Wofford in Lorain, Ohio, strove to free language from 'the fetters of race'.
Her work had its roots in the work of William Faulkner - a Nobel laureate in
1949 - and other writers from the American south. It was 'unusually finely
wrought and cohesive, yet at the same time rich in variation.' They
described her 1992 book Jazz as richly complex, which sensuously conveyed
characters and moods.
