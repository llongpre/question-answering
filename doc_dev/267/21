   Three Americans who gave investors,
stockholders and corporate directors a better understanding of the
intricate financial markets won the Nobel memorial prize in
economics Tuesday.
   Harry F. Markowitz of the City University of New York, Merton
Miller of the University of Chicago and William Sharpe of Stanford
University will share the prize, worth about $700,000.
   Since the prize in economics was first awarded by the Swedish
Academy of Sciences in 1969, 18 of the 30 winners have been
Americans.
   ``There has been a very powerful and rich development of finance
economy as a scientific subject, and that was a main reason for
giving them the prize,'' said academy committee member Bengt
Naslund.
   The academy said financial markets serve a key purpose in a
modern market economy by allocating resources to various production
areas.
   ``It's important that these markets function efficiently. That,
they can really only do if we have a proper understanding of
them,'' Naslund said.
   Therefore, he said, Markowitz, Sharpe and Miller made ``an
essential contribution which concerns us all.''
   Miller, 67, said he thought it was a crank call when committee
chairman Assar Lindbeck called him early Tuesday with the news.
   ``I picked up the phone, and you don't hear anything ... and
suddenly I hear a voice with a Swedish accent, and my heart stopped
a bit,'' he said.
   Lindbeck said Miller and Sharpe were ``really stunned'' by the
news but recovered enough to ask about the exchange rate for
kronor.
   The academy deayed announcing the prize for about 45 minutes
while trying to reach Markowitz in Japan, where he begins teaching
a course Wednesday at Tokyo University. But reporters found him
first.
   ``I'd thought it was never going to happen,'' the 63-year-old
Markowitz said.
   Markowitz developed a theory in the 1950s explaining how
households and companies choose shares and reduce the risks
involved, the so-called theory of portfolio choice.
   ``His theory analyzes how wealth can be optimally invested in
assets which differ in regard to their expected return and risk,
and thereby also how risks can be reduced,'' the academy said.
   Markowitz published his pioneer works in 1952 and 1959. Sharpe
and Miller drew on his theories.
   ``My work follows Harry Markowitz,'' said Sharpe, reached in
Arizona. ``He was my mentor. ... I owe him a huge debt.''
   Sharpe, 56, developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model in the
1960s. It is considered the backbone of modern price theory for
financial markets.
   The model helps in calculating capital costs associated with
investments and takeovers, regulating public utilities and deciding
court cases involving expropriated firms whose shares are not
listed on stock exchanges. It is also used in empirical analysis to
arrange statistical data systematically and efficiently.
   Miller showed what factors determine a company's choices in
accruing debt and distributing assets.
   ``He underscored the important relationship between a company
and that same capital market which the other two prize-winners
analyzed,'' Naslund said.
   Miller's theory is based on the assumption that stockholders
have access to the same capital market as firms. As a result,
corporate managers saw that the best way to safeguard the interests
of stockholders was to maximize the firm's net wealth.
   Miller initially collaborated with 1985 economics prize-winner
Franco Modigliani of the United States.
   ``Our work was known as the Modigliani-Miller propositions of
corporate finance,'' Miller said. ``He then won it (the prize) for
his contributions with me, but also for his other work in
economics.''
   The economics prize was instituted in 1968 by Sweden's Central
Bank to complement the five prizes established in the will of
dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel. Nobel's original prizes in physics,
chemistry, medicine, peace and literature have been awarded since
1901.
   The Nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced
Wednesday.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was awarded the peace
prize on Monday. Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the
prize in literature, and Americans Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall
Thomas won the prize in medicine.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death in 1896.
