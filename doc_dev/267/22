<HEAD>Three Nobel Academy Members Quit, Two Cite Rushdie Affair</HEAD>

   Three members of the academy that awards
the Nobel Prize for literature have resigned, and two said they were
unhappy that the body did not denounce Iran's death threat against
Salman Rushdie.
   The secretary of the Swedish Academy, Sture Allen, confirmed
Thursday he received three letters of resignation but said they
could not be accepted because the academy's 200-year-old rules
stipulate that members are elected for life.
   Author Kerstin Ekman, one of the three to resign from the
18-member body, told Swedish radio afterward, ``No human can, at
least in our country, belong to an organization which she does not
want to be part of. ... I guess they just cannot admit that we
quit.''
   In any case, Allen said the resignations will not affect the work
of the academy. He declined further comment.
   The third resigning member, poet Werner Aspenstrom, did not
disclose his reasons but told Swedish television his motives
differed from those of his two colleagues.
   The resignations came weeks before the announcement of the winner
of the Nobel Prize for literature. The date is not set in advance
but traditionally falls in October.
   In explaining her reasons for resigning, Ms. Ekman said, ``I am
upset about the Rushdie affair.''
   She and another resigning colleague, former Academy Secretary
Lars Gyllensten, stopped taking part in the academy's work in
February.
   They said they were protesting because the academy refused to
condemn explicitly the death threat issued Feb. 14 by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. Khomeini said Rushdie
blasphemed Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' a bestseller
that stirred worldwide protests among Moslems.
   Several other Academy members have complained about the group's
stand on the Rushdie case but generally accepted its tradition of
avoiding official statements on political issues.
   Ms. Ekman said the three resigning members had not planned their
action together. She said she had submitted a resignation now to let
a substitute be elected.
   She also said the Academy was in need of renewal. ``Everybody
realizes that it has come to a standstill,'' she said.
   The Academy statutes were written by King Gustaf III, who founded
the institution in 1786. It has awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize
for literature since 1901.
