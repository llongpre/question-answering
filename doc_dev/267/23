   A stand-in for Mikhail Gorbachev, in
accepting the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize for him Monday, read a
statement by the Soviet president saying mankind has reached ``the
moment of truth.''
   Gorbachev said problems at home kept him from attending the Oslo
ceremony.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, King Carl XVI Gustaf handed out gold Nobel
Prize medallions and diplomas at a ceremony for the 10 laureates in
medicine, literature, physics, chemistry and economics.
   Literature prize winner Octavio Paz of Mexico received the
longest ovation from the crowd of 1,800 at Stockholm Concert Hall.
He later told a glittering banquet in the Swedish capital, ``We are
at the end of ideologies. We don't know what will be the face of
the future.
   ``But we do know that the environment is in danger. We need to
rediscover the feeling that the universe is a unity and that we are
a part of it.''
   The Swedish Academy cited Paz for ``impassioned writing with
wide horizons, characterized by sensuous intelligence and
humanistic integrity.''
   Each prize this year is worth 4 million kronor (about $715,000).
Sole winners get the whole amount. Multiple winners in one category
divide it. Checks are deposited electronically into the laureates'
bank accounts the day after the ceremony.
   The United States, which produced eight winners this year in
economics, physics and medicine, is the only country that taxes the
prize money.
   The winners at in Stockholm talked about the Earth's future and
paid tribute to their patients, students and co-workers in
accepting the awards for achievements that benefitted mankind.
   Gorbachev's acceptance speech was read by envoy Anatoly Kovalyov
in Oslo City Hall.
   Referring to the past ``unnatural division of Europe'' and to
Germany's recent unification, the Soviet leader wrote, ``We have
begun to resolutely tear down the material foundations of a
military, political and ideological confrontation.''
   He quoted 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant: ``Kant
prophesized that mankind would one day be faced with a dilemma:
either to be joined in a true union of nations or to perish in a
war of annihilation ending in the extinction of the human race.
   ``Now, as we move from the second to the third millennium, the
clock has struck the moment of truth.''
   In Moscow, Gorbachev said he regarded the 71st peace prize as
``a recognition of what we call perestroika and innovative
political thinking, which is of vital significance for human
destinies all over the world.''
   Protesters in Oslo, Stockholm and Moscow denounced the Norwegian
Nobel Committee's decision to award him the prize and complained
about violence,human rights violations and political restrictions
in the Soviet Union.
   Kovalyov said the $715,000 probably would be donated to worthy
causes.
   Joseph E. Murray of Milford, Mass., accepted the medicine prize
on behalf of himself and co-winner E. Donnall Thomas of Seattle,
whose pioneering work in bone marrow transplants led to a cure for
most childhood leukemia.
   Murray, who performed the first organ transplant, with kidneys,
in 1954, said: ``The prize pays tribute to the hundreds of patients
now living healthy lives. We are indebted to these patients who
have been unselfishly involved in this research.''
   Elias Corey of Cambridge, Mass., recipient of the chemistry
prize for discovering how to simulate organic synthesis in the
laboratory, made hundreds of medicines and other products easily
available and affordable.
   ``Chemistry can be applied to improve the life of man and make
life happier for all of us,'' Corey said.
   Richard E. Taylor of Medicine Hat, Alberta;, Jerome I. Friedman
of Chicago and Henry W. Kendall of Boston shared the physics prize
for experiments which helped prove the existence of subatomic
particles called quarks and increased knowledge about the basic
structure of the universe.
   ``There was great elation'' among financial economists over the
recognition of their field by this year's Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economics, said winner Harry M. Markowitz of New York. He spoke for
co-recipients Merton H. Miller of Chicago and William F. Sharpe of
Stanford University. The three were recognized for pioneering work
in the theory of financial economics and how markets function.
   The Nobel Prizes are awarded on the anniversary of the death of
Alfred Nobel, Swedish inventor of dynamite who established them in
his 1896 will. Sweden's Central Bank established the economics
prize in 1968.
   Gorbachev is the the third Eastern European who has not received
his prize in person since 1975. Poland's Lech Walesa won in 1983
and Soviet human rights champion Andrei Sakharov, now dead, won in
1975.
