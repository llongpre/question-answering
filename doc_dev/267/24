   A French professor whose visit to the
United States during the Depression sparked his interest in
economics today won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Maurice Allais, 77,
won the award ``for his pioneering contributions to the theory of
markets and efficient utilization of resources.''
   Allais told reporters at his suburban Paris home that the award
was ``mindboggling.''
   ``My motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to
improve the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of
the problems facing the world,'' he said.
   ``That's what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of
helping people.''
   He was the first French economist to win the coveted award since
it was created in 1968. Americans have dominated the prize, taking
15 of the 25 awards since it was created by the Bank of Sweden.
Five winners were British.
   Allais did his economic research at the Ecole Nationale
Superieure des Mines de Paris, the academy said.
   Although his work is little known outside France, Allais ``is
the most prominent figure in modern economic research in France as
regards basic theory and applications to public-sector planning,''
said the 300-member academy in a statement.
   Jacques Levy, director of the Ecole Nationale des Mines, one of
France's most prestigious institutions of higher education, said
Allais ``was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in
postwar France between 1945 and 1968.''
   Within the world of French economic thought after World War II _
in which leftists and rightists agreed that the state should play a
major role in the economy _ Allais established a place for reliance
on market forces.
   Allais's work provided ``a very strong base for those opposed to
government direction of the economy,'' said Jacques Lautman,
scientific director for human sciences at France's National Center
for Scientific Research.
   Allais' training was as an engineer. But in the 1930s, he
visited the United States during the Depression, seeing factories
idled and people unemployed.
   ``This is what sparked him to consecrate his life to
economics,'' Levy said.
   The academy said Allais' greatest contributions came in the
1940s with his work on market equilibrium and efficiency.
   He published works in 1943 and 1947 detailing his theories,
which provided guidelines for using prices in monopolies and for
public sector planning.
   The son of a cheese store owner, Allais was born in 1911 in
Paris. He is a professor of the Center for Economic Analysis at the
Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines.
   His works include: Frequency, Probability and Chance; The
General Theory of Surplus; and Third World at the Crossroads.
   Allais, who has served in French governments in several
positions and was named an officer of the Legion of Honor in 1977,
also wrote studies on history and physics.
   He graduated at the top of his class from Ecole Polytechnique in
1933 and then attended the Ecole National Superieure des Mines
until 1936.
   Allais joins three drug researchers from the United States and
Britain who became 1988 Nobel laureates on Monday for discoveries
leading to medications for heart disease, AIDS and other deadly
illnesses.
   Robert M. Solow, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
won the economics prize last year for creating a model showing how
technology and other factors influence economic growth.
   The economics prize is a late addition to the five awards
established in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed his
fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific
breakthroughs, activities for peace, and literature ``of an
idealistic tendency.''
   On Wednesday the prizes in physics and chemistry will be
announced, closing the list of laureates for this year.
   The U.N. peacekeeping forces were awarded the peace prize Sept.
29 by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo. The literature prize
was won by Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz.
   The prizes carry a cash award of 2.5 million kronor, or about
$390,000 at today's exchange rate. The prizes will be distributed
Dec. 10 in Stockholm, except the peace prize which is given the
same day in Oslo.
   On Monday the medicine prize was awarded to Gertrude B. Elion,
70, and George H. Hitchings, 83, for identifying differences in the
processing of genetic materials in normal cells and cancer cells,
protozoa, bacteria and viruses.
   They shared the prize with James W. Black of Great Britain who
discovered beta blockers, the key to developing medicines which
calm the body, control blood pressure and help prevent fatalities
in heart attack victims.
