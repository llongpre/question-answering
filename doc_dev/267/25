Academy for the literature prize in 25 years.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I'm very, very amazed," she said, reached at her son's home in New York.
She later told a news conference she would use the prize money, 6 million
kronor (about $1 million), to help struggling black writers in South Africa.; 
  In its citation, the academy said Gordimer's "magnificent epic writing has
-- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- 'been of very great benefit to humanity.'; 
 "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated
personal and social relationships in her environment," the academy said in
announcing its selection in Stockholm, Sweden.;   It added that Gordimer has
managed to be politically involved in her country without permitting that "to
encroach on her writings. Nevertheless, her literary works, in giving profound
insights into the historical process, help to shape this process.";   Gordimer
is the third South African to win a Nobel prize. Archbishop Desmond Tutu won
the Peace Prize in 1984 and Chief Albert Luthuli, the late leader of the
African National Congress, also was awarded the Peace Prize, in 1960.;   "I
couldn't be in better company," said Gordimer, who joined the ANC last year.; 
 Ben Mokoena, of the ANC's arts and culture department, said the award "is
great for South Africa and for all democratic writers here. It will certainly
encourage young writers.";   Gordimer is the second author from sub-Saharan
Africa to win the coveted prize, following Wole Soyinka, of Nigeria, the 1986
laureate.;   Over the past 40 years, her 10 novels and more than 200 short
stories have brought the plight of South Africa's 28 million blacks to an
international audience, earning the gratitude of anti-apartheid activists.;  
Along the way, though, she has drawn the anger of successive white-minority
governments in her country. Three of Gordimer's novels have been banned, only
to be unbanned later under international pressure. In the past, her telephone
has been tapped and she has been followed by security police.;   She modestly
dismisses that, though, saying "one mustn't have delusions of being important
enough to be a danger.";   One of her banned books, "Burger's Daughter,"
published in 1979, explored the life of a young white woman whose father, a
doctor, sacrifices his life in the black liberation struggle.;   The censors
spoke;   South Africa's censors complained that the book was "used as a pad
from which to launch a blistering and full-scale political attack on the
republic of South Africa, its government racial policies, white privilege,
social and political structures, forces for preservation of law and order,
black housing and education, the pass laws, etc.";   "The negative is
stressed," the censors concluded, "and the positive is ignored.";   That ban
was eventually lifted and, in recent years, South Africa's censors have
changed their minds about 1,500 once-banned books.;   The academy members
cited Gordimer for the body of her work, but they singled out four of her
novels and two volumes of short stories for special praise. They described "A
Guest of Honour," a 1970 novel about a returning colonial administrator who
becomes involved in the conflicts in his country, as a landmark during the
first half of her career.;   They also lauded "The Conservationist," published
in 1974, "Burger's Daughter," and "July's People" in 1981, "each of which
illustrates . . . personal standpoints in the complicated spiritual and
material environment of an Africa in which black consciousness is growing.";  
 Relations reversed; In "July's People," one of her best-known works, Gordimer
envisions an armed black rebellion in South Africa and follows a white family,
the Smales, who flee their fancy suburban home and are sheltered by July,
their black "boy," or houseman, in his rural village. The traditional
master-servant relationship in South Africa is turned upside down by the
Smales' increasing reliance on July.;   Her most recent novel, "My Son's
Story," published in 1990, follows a married black man who is imprisoned for
his political beliefs and falls in love with a fellow anti-apartheid activist,
a white woman, who visits him in jail.;   "The relationship of the lovers is
described with great tenderness," the academy said, even as "the unyielding
political reality constantly intrudes." It described the novel as "ingenious
and revealing.";   Gordimer was the first woman to win a Nobel for literature
since 1966, when German-Swedish writer Nelly Sachs shared the award with
Israeli author Shmuel Agnon. She is the seventh woman of the 88 literature
prize winners.;   The literature award was the first of six Nobel prizes to be
announced this month. Nobel Prizes are endowed by the 1896 will of Swedish
dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel.; WORD OF A NOBEL WINNER; LYING THERE in the
room that smelled of the sweat of all their bodies, the dregs of their beer,
and the bitterness of cigarette ends, hearing the man snort, turn on the cheap
iron bed uninhibited in acceptance of himself in sleep, as he was always, Bray
thought how it was a remarkable man, there -- like many of the other
remarkable men on this continent who had ended up dead in a ditch. Then the
blacks blamed the white men for manipulating power in a continent they had
never really left; the whites blamed tribalism and the interference of the
East (if they themselves were of the West) or the West (if they themselves
were of the East). The remarkable men talked of socialism and the common man,
or of glory and Messianic greatness, and died for copper, uranium or oil.;
