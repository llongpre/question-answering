   Never in its tradition-bound 203 years
has the Swedish Academy, an august body of professors, authors and
literary critics, been in such a muddle _ and just before it is to
award the Nobel Prize in literature.
   Angered by its response to the Salman Rushdie affair, three of
its 18 members have handed in resignation letters. But chosen for
life, they cannot quit. They must remain until they die.
   Members claim the rift has not hampered the work of choosing
this year's Nobel laureate, who is to be announced this month.
   But it has exposed tensions inside this elite body and tainted
its image.
   Historically, internal fighting was been kept within the
Academy's 18th-century walls. A member's only form of protest has
been to quietly boycott the weekly meetings.
   Writer Kerstin Ekman, 56, one of the three rebels, has openly
demanded change, saying ``new and fresh forces are needed'' in the
Academy.
   ``We would have dug the Academy's grave, had we let the three
go,'' responded Goran Malmkvist, a professor who joined the Academy
in 1985. ``Who would have agreed to replace them? No one.''
   The work of the prestigious body always has been shrouded in
tradition and rituals that gave it an air of untouchable noblesse.
   That came to an end in March, after Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla
Khomeini pronounced a death sentence against British author Salman
Rushdie for his book ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems
found offensive.
   The sentence aroused the fury of literary figures and
governments around the world.
   But the Academy, after long discussion, issued a brief and
carefully phrased statement defending free expression but without
explicitly supporting Rushdie.
   ``It should be self-evident to everyone that the Swedish Academy
firmly repudiates every effort to strangle free speech,'' the
statement said.
   Further comment would violate the Academy's code against
political involvement, Academy officials said.
   One reason for its deliberate neutrality is to avoid suspicion
that the Nobel Prize can be influenced by politics.
   Along with Mrs. Ekman, who at 56 is the youngest Academy member,
the other dissenters were Lars Gyllensten, a 71-year-old physician,
writer and Academy member for 23 years, and author Werner
Aspenstrom, 70.
   Gyllensten said such ``vague'' and ``obvious'' remarks from one
of the world's most influential literary bodies was in itself a
political statement.
   ``It must be regarded as political submissiveness ... which is
incompatible with the best traditions of the Academy and the brave
choices of Nobel winners that I have had the joy and honor to take
part in,'' he said, writing of his determination to quit.
   Gyllensten called his decision ``a personal tragedy'' but said
he could not accept the Academy's tiptoeing in sensitive political
matters.
   That ``makes it impossible to award good Nobel prizes,'' he
wrote in an open letter last month.
   There seems no room for compromise, since the academy decided
last month that to accept the three resignations would betray the
Academy's history.
   ``We are in a one-way street, and there is not much I can do,''
Gyllensten said.
   Members have quit the academy before, but never three at once.
   At the end of last century, Henning Hamilton, a senior
government official, was forced to resign over economic
irregularities in his business. Professor Johan Ihre, a Swedish
language expert, was then elected to the Academy but refused to
join.
   Some of the Academy's customs date back to 1786, when it was
founded by King Gustav III. Housed in the magnificent Stock
Exchange building in Old Town, it has for two centuries been
charged with the task of furthering the Swedish language and
literature.
   But it was Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, who made the
Academy world famous by assigning it the duty of awarding a
literature prize in his name, which it has done since 1901.
   The Academy emerges from its scholastic isolation just one time
a year, when at exactly 1 p.m. on a Thursday in October the
permament secretary announces the laureate.
   The members would like to keep it that way.
