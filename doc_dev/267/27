   Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela, in
town to collect his Nobel Prize for literature, says he'll be glad
when all the fuss is over and he can start working again.
   ``Since the announcement of the prize I haven't led any life at
all. I've just been answering questions all the time,'' he told a
news conference Tuesday.
   Cela, 73, has published 70 novels, travelogues, essays and books
of poetry. His 1942 book ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' was the
most popular work of Spanish fiction since Cervantes' Don Quixote.
   Though claiming to be disturbed by the unceasing attention since
the prize was announced Oct. 18, Cela said he was coming to receive
the Nobel ``with gratitude and emotion.''
   ``But I'm looking forward to being able to sit at my desk and
start working again,'' he said.
   Cela will be given his award by Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf on
Sunday, and a check for the equivalent of $469,000.
   The writer dismissed the idea he would now ``rest on his
laurels'' after receiving one of the world's most coveted literary
awards. ``I can't imagine a retrospective future,'' he said.
   Asked who inspired him the most, Cela said, ``I was inspired by
all Spanish authors before me. Literature is part of a culture.''
   He said he best enjoyed reading medieval Spanish poets. He also
mentioned the late Ernest Hemingway as an influence.
   ``Hemingway was my friend. We went to a lot of bullfights
together. He was a great author and a great friend,'' Cela said.
   Cela drew on his experiences in the Spanish Civil War for many
of his stories, which often showed the violent and gruesome side of
life.
