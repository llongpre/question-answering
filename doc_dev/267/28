   The Nobel Foundation said Monday that
the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize winner will be announced Sept. 29.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
reportedly are among the top contenders for the richest Nobel award
ever.
   The prize for medicine will be awarded Oct. 17, for economy on
Oct. 18 and the prizes for physics and chemistry on Oct. 19, the
Nobel Foundation said.
   By tradition, the date for awarding the literature prize is kept
secret until one week before the announcement.
   Each Nobel laureate will receive about $385,000, which is about
15 percent higher than last year.
   The Peace prize announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, by
the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian parliament. The others will be
announced in Stockholm by the Swedish Acedemy of Sciences, the
Karolinska Institute of medicine, and by the prestigious 18-member
literary committee known as the Swedish Academy.
   The prizes will be distributed Dec. 10 in Oslo and Stockholm.
   The Norwegian press has reported that Reagan and Gorbachev were
nominated for signing a treaty to dismantle their medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   The Nobel committee refuses to confirm the names of the
candidates, whose nominations had to be submitted before Feb. 1.
   A Norwegian member of parliament has said he nominated President
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, and five Swedish
parliamentarians announced they had proposed a campaigner against
the death penalty in the United States, the Rev. Joseph Ingle of
the Nashville, Tenn.-based Southern Coalition on Jails and Prisons.
   Other possible nominations include Pope John Paul II, jailed
South African black leader Nelson Mandela, Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and Mordechai Vanunu, an Israeli imprisoned on treason
charges for disclosing details of his country's nuclear capability.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias won the 1987 Peace prize for
drafting a plan to end the fighting in Central America.
