   Presidents Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the
Soviet Union and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia were the
front-runners in speculation about today's awarding of the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize.
   If it were up to the Norwegian news media, they would be joint
recipients. They were the most prominent names among about 10
candidates local Nobel watchers believe would make likely choices
for the prize, awarded to someone who has worked for peace,
championed liberty and helped the downtrodden or promoted
brotherhood.
   But the name of the winner is a closely guarded secret, and the
media are often wrong. The Nobel Committee considered 100
nominations this year.
   The prize has been withheld 19 times since it was first awarded
in 1901.
   Another difficulty in guessing the winner of this year's
$700,000 prize is that the Nobel Committee has been changing the
geographic focus of the award.
   ``The changing has been very important: to no longer look just
to the Western world but to the whole world,'' Gidske Anderson,
leader of the five-member committee, said in an interview last
week.
   She said she found the media speculation amusing.
   Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite, established the
award in his 1896 will.
   He said it should go to ``the person who shall have done the
most or the best work for fraternity between peoples, for the
abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and
promotion of peace congresses.''
   The awards committee has taken some liberty in interpreting
Nobel's intention.
   It has awarded the prize 16 times to organizations or agencies.
It has awarded it to more than one person 16 times, and it has
recognized and encouraged work that has not yet borne fruit in the
fields of peace and human rights.
   Many of the pro-democracy activists and reformers in Eastern
Europe who were mentioned last year as possible winners may have a
better chance now.
   Havel once was a jailed dissident. Now he is Czechoslovakia's
president.
   Gorbachev was touted last year as a likely candidate, along with
former President Reagan, for their disarmament efforts.
   Although both were nominated again, news media speculation in
Norway and Sweden has focused on Gorbachev's encouragement of
democratic reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Another perennial candidate is Nelson Mandela.
   When the African National Congress leader was nominated for this
year's prize, he was still in prison, serving his 27th year for
plotting to overthrow the white minority government of South
Africa.
   Now he is free, preparing to negotiate with the government on an
end to apartheid amid the worst fighting among black South Africans
in decades.
   Mandela would be the second ANC leader to receive the award.
Then ANC President Albert Luthuli won the 1960 prize.
   Other frequently mentioned candidates were Chai Ling, one of the
Chinese pro-democracy activists; Pope John Paul II; German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Burmese opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi.
   Nobel endowed four other prizes, in medicine, physics, chemistry
and literature, which are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1968, will be awarded Tuesday.
   The Nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced
Wednesday.
   Last week, Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the
literature prize. Two American doctors, Joseph E. Murray and E.
Donnall Thomas, won the medicine prize for pioneering organ and
bone marrow transplants.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.
