   Octavio Paz, who explored the Mexican
character and the universal themes of love, death and loneliness in
lyrical poetry and impassioned essays, won the Nobel Prize in
literature Thursday.
   The Swedish Academy awarded Paz the prize for his ``exquisite
love poetry, at the same time sensuous and visual,'' and for his
wide international perspective.
   It also cited Paz for his essays on Mexican society, calling him
``a lodestar in the tide of opinion.'' Paz's views have angered the
left and the right in his homeland, and he was dumped by leftists
who felt he turned on their cause.
   Paz, 76, said he was ``very, very surprised'' at being selected.
   ``Poetry is not a very popular art form these days, but it's an
essential part of human life,'' Paz said in New York, where he is
inaugurating a Mexican art exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. ``Poetry is the memory of a country, of language.''
   ``The prize is a sign that the Spanish and Latin American
literature is in good health,'' he added.
   Paz is the fifth Nobel laureate from Latin America. The last
previous was Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Colombia, in 1982.
   ``It's also a great triumph for the glorious Spanish language,''
said 1989 laureate Camilo Jose Cela of Spain. Cela spoke in Madrid.
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, one of Latin America's
leading authors, said in Washington, ``Octavio is one of the
greatest poets that the Spanish-language world has produced and, at
the same time, a great humanist.''
   But Swedish Academy spokesman Sture Allen said the prize was
meant to honor writers, not a language.
   The academy pointedly praised Paz's ``wide international
perspective,'' gained during a 25-year diplomatic career.
   ``Paz's poetry and essays evolve from an intractable but
fruitful union of cultures, pre-Columbian Indian, the Spanish
Conquistadors, and Western modernism,'' the academy said.
   The academy said one of the high points of his work was the 1957
poem ``Sun Stone,'' which was inspired by a huge Aztec calendar
stone. ``This suggestive work with its many layers of meaning seems
to incorporate, interpet and reconstrue major existential
questions, death, time, love and reality,'' the academy said.
   In a Swedish radio interview, Paz recommended his essay, ``The
Labyrinth of Solitude,'' and his poetry, to those who have not read
his work.
   The academy said Paz's ``own identity, Mexican and, in its
broader meaning, Latin American, has been explored decisively'' in
``Labyrinth.''
   The essay deeply affected how Mexican society was viewed at home
and abroad, and was denounced by the left and the right.
   The academy said Paz himself embodies a ``union of cultures - it
is in his blood. His mother's family was Spanish, from Andalusia.
On his father's side the Indian and the Spanish are combined.''
   He was born March 31, 1914, and, thanks to his grandfather's
extensive library, Paz developed a love for literature at an early
age. He earned a law degree and entered the diplomatic service.
   But he resigned as ambassador to India in 1968 and ended his
diplomatic career when the Mexican army fired on anti-government
student protesters, killing at least 300.
   He considers himself a socialist and a democrat, but has been
ostracized for criticizing the left.
   ``I think that if there is one profoundly reactionary sector in
Latin America, it is the leftist intellectual,'' he said in an
interview in 1979. ``They are people without memory. I have never
heard any one of them admit he made a mistake.''
   Paz has many times criticized Mexico's governing party for six
decades, the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   But Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Thursday,
``He is a poet and writer of whom we Mexicans feel proud. He has a
universal stature.''
   The academy said Paz's open-mindedness allowed him to remain a
strong influence on contemporary literature. He still publishes the
journal ``Vuelta,'' or ``Return,'' which he founded in 1976.
   He received an honorary doctorate in 1980 from Harvard
University, where he lectures.
   Paz won the most important award in the Spanish-speaking world,
the Cervantes prize, in 1981, and the American Neustadt Prize in
1982.
   Paz's Swedish publisher, Adam Bromberg, said the author had been
on the academy's ``short list'' of top literature candidates for 15
years.
   Others said to be in the running included Chinese poet Bei Dao,
Irish poet Seamus Heaney, American novelist Joyce Carol Oates,
Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado, novelist Margaret Atwood of Canada,
South African author Nadine Gordimer and Japanese novelist Masuji
Ibuse.
   The prize, worth about $700,000, is one of five awarded in
October under terms of the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
inventor of dynamite, who died in 1896.
   Two American doctors who pioneered human organ, cell and bone
marrow transplants, Joseph E. Murray, 71, and E. Donnall Thomas,
70, won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday.
   The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded next Monday in Oslo,
Norway. The Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics will be awarded
in Stockholm on Oct. 17.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1969, will be awarded Oct. 16.
