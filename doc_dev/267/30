   Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in
physics today for discovering a way to use beams of ghostlike
subatomic particles called neutrinos to peer ever deeper into the
fundamental structure of matter.
   Three West Germans won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for
determining the structure of proteins that plants and some bacteria
need to convert sunlight to energy through photosynthesis.
   The Royal Academy of Sciences awarded the physics prize to Leon
Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger for their work with
neutrino beams.
   The announcement said their work was carried out in the 1960s
and ``opened entirely new opportunities for research into the
innermost structure and dynamics of matter.''
   The academy also cited their discovery of the muon neutrino.
   Neutrinos are extremely tiny particles _ even on the subatomic
scale _ with no electrical charge. They interact very weakly with
other forms of matter and could easily pass through a layer of lead
trillions of miles thick without being diverted from their course,
according to the Nobel citation.
   ``The contribution now awarded consisted among other things of
transforming the ghostly neutrino into an active tool of
research,'' the announcement said.
   Lederman, who got the call from Stockholm around 6 a.m. EDT,
said:
   ``It's a nice way to be awakened. ... They apologized for waking
me up, but I said that's quite all right, anytime.''
   Asked about the scientists' research, he added: ``This is an
experiment that was completed and published in 1961. Those poor
guys in Stockholm have been puzzling over it ever since and finally
decided it was good stuff.
   ``Some day, some kid who is now in high school will find out how
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society.''
   Lederman, 66, said he hasn't decided whether to use his share of
the $390,000 prize ``to buy a castle in Spain or a string of race
horses.''
   Lederman is director at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory in Batavia, Ill. Schwartz, 55, is a former professor at
Stanford University and now president of Digital Pathways, Inc., in
Mountain View, Calif.
   Steinberger, 67, was born in Bad Kissingen, West Germany, and is
an American citizen. However, the academy officially lists his
nationality as Swiss. He has been a physicist at CERN, in Geneva,
since 1968.
   The academy cited the laureates' research at Columbia University
in the early 1960s, when they tried to find a way to study the
effect of weak forces at high energies.
   During a coffee break, Lederman, Schwartz and Steinberger, with
other scientists, discussed using beams of ``common'' particles _
electrons, protons and neutrons _ but those beams were judged
unsatisfactory for the purpose.
   Schwartz then proposed using a beam of neutrinos for the
experiment. It took two years to devise an intense beam of
neutrinos free from all other particles and to design a detector to
measure reactions produced by the neutrino beam, the announcement
said.
   Chemistry prizewinners Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber and
Hartmut Michel of West Germany were cited ``for the determination
of the three-dimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction
center.''
   In 1982, Michel was able to obtain the proteins in a crystalline
form that allowed their structure to be determined. He then
determined their structure in collaboration with Deisenhofer and
Huber.
   Deisenhofer, 45, studied at the Max Planck Institute for
Biochemistry and now works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
in Dallas.
   Huber, 51, is still at the Max Planck biochemistry institute in
Martinsried, West Germany. Michel, 42, works at the Max Planck
Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt.
   The proteins they studied were taken from bacteria which, like
green plants, draw energy from sunlight. These so-called
membrane-bound proteins are found in the membranes surrounding
structures called chloroplasts and mitochondria inside cells.
Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which is essential to
photosynthesis, and mitochondria are the cell's energy-generating
factories.
   The work of Deisenhofer, Huber and Michel led to increased
understanding of photosynthesis not only in bacteria, but in algae
and higher plants as well, the academy said.
   Today's prizes were the last of six for 1988. Each prize is
worth $390,000.
   On Tuesday, Maurice Allais, whose ideas on balancing supply and
demand helped rebuild the French economy after World War II, won
the Nobel Prize for economics.
   On Monday, American researchers Gertrude B. Elion and George H.
Hitchings shared the medicine award with Sir James W. Black of
Britain for helping develop drugs to treat leukemia, high blood
pressure, AIDS and other diseases.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize, announced
Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway, and the award in literature went last
week to Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the first Arabic-language
writer to win it.
   Economics is the only one of the six Nobel prizes not stipulated
in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of
dynamite, who died in 1896.
