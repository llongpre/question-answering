<LEADPARA>  Nadine Gordimer, a white South African novelist whose denunciations of
apartheid caused some of her works to be banned in her homeland, won the 1991
Nobel Prize in literature today. She was the first woman in 25 years to win
the prize.;   The Royal Swedish Academy, which awarded the prize to Gordimer,
67, said her "magnificent epic writing" has been "of very great benefit to
humanity." The prize is worth about $1 million.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I'm really tremendously surprised and thrilled," said Gordimer, reached by
telephone in New York, where she has been lecturing.;   Some of Gordimer's
works, which include 10 novels over a 38-year span and more than 200 short
stories, have in the past been banned by South Africa's white minority
government.;   But she refused to leave her homeland, once telling an
interviewer that "to go into exile is to lose your place in the world.";   Her
most recent novel, published in 1990, is "My Son's Story," about a married
black man who falls in love with a fellow activist, a white woman. Her most
recent collection of short stories, "Jump," was published this year.;  
Gordimer "writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated
personal and social relationships in her environment," the academy said. "At
the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that
basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings.";  
"Nevertheless, her literary works, in giving profound insights into the
historical process, help to shape this process," it said.;   Gordimer said in
the telephone interview that she believes major political changes have taken
place in South Africa, but that the struggle was far from over. "We've got to
go on pressing," she said. "We can't be discouraged by difficulties on the
way.";   In December 1989, in a dramatic demonstration of her convictions, she
testified as a defense witness for 11 black activists on trial for treason and
terrorism.;   "Having lived here for 65 years," she once said, "I am well
aware for how long black people refrained from violence. We white people are
responsible for it.";   Gordimer grew up in the mining town of Springs, the
daughter of an English mother and a Jewish watchmaker who had emigrated from
Lithuania. Her childhood dream was to be a ballet dancer, but her mother
forbade physical exertion because of an accelerated heart rate.;   Gordimer,
who had been writing since the age of 9, turned increasingly to books for
companionship after she was withdrawn from school at the age of 11 because of
her physical weakness.;   She spent hours in the Springs library. She credits
"The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's expose on the Chicago meat industry, for
planting the seed of social awareness in her young mind.;   "When I read 'The
Jungle,' the way the meat workers were treated related to what I had taken for
granted was simply a God-given circumstance -- the mine workers in their
compounds not far from where we lived -- and I then began to look objectively
at the way blacks were treated as units of labor. I think I was puzzled; I was
disturbed. But it was the beginning I suppose of what you call a social
conscience.";   Gordimer's first story was published when she was 15 in a
literary magazine. When she was 27, her first book, "Face to Face," was
published.;   She how lives in Johannesburg with her second husband. She has
two grown children.;   The academy said Gordimer, in works since the 1970s,
had developed a complex novelistic technique that produced three masterpieces.
The academy cited "The Conservationist" of 1974, "Burger's Daughter" of 1979,
and "July's People" of 1981.;   These books, it said, "illustrate conceivable
personal standpoints in the complicated spiritual and material environment of
an Africa in which black consciousness is growing.";   The academy also
honored Gordimer for her shorter stories, gathered in seven collections.
"Compact and dense, they are extremely telling and show Gordimer at the height
of her creative powers," the academy said. It mentioned "Selected Stories" of
1975.;   "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her
outstanding literary style, characterize her short stories as well," the
academy said.;   Gordimer has also published a few volumes of literary
criticism, as well as a large number of articles, speeches and lectures on
different subjects.;   In the telephone interview, Gordimer said she saw the
prize as recognition for a body of work over the years, and praised fellow
South African writers who helped her persevere.;   "They've all been
determined to go on writing. They all very much wanted this for me," she
said.; Gordimer's works; The Swedish Academy Thursday listed the following
