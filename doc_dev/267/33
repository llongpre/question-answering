   Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in
physics Wednesday for their work with subatomic particles, and
three West Germans shared the chemistry prize for discoveries that
may be critical in harnessing the sun's energy.
   Americans Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger
shared the physics prize for capturing neutrinos in a high energy
beam to probe the stucture of atomic particles.
   Chemists Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel of
West Germany were honored for their work in unraveling a mystery of
photosynthesis. They were rewarded for work completed only three
years ago, indicating the importance attached to their breakthrough
by the awarding committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
   Many recipients wait decades for recognition.
   Committee chairman Bo Malmstrom said their work was an essential
step toward artificial photosynthesis, which scientists hope will
provide the key to converting the sun's energy to man's needs.
   ``The only way in the long run to solve the energy problem of
the world is to utilize solar energy,'' Malmstrom said.
   Although it had no immediate practical application, the academy
said the research had importance beyond the study of
photosynthesis, the process of converting sunlight into energy.
   It said the research could be used in understanding central
biological functions, including the transport of chemical
substances between cells, hormone action and nerve impulses.
   The physics award also was for basic research with no practical
use as yet, said Bengt Nagel, secretary of the academy's physics
committee.
   ``Some day, some kid who is now in high school will find out how
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society,'' said
Lederman.
   The physicists discovered a way to concentrate neutrinos by the
hundreds of billions into a beam capable of probing the inner parts
of protons in the same way an X-ray penetrates the human body, the
academy said.
   Neutrinos are extremely tiny particles _ even on the subatomic
scale _ with no electrical charge. They interact very weakly with
other forms of matter and could easily pass through a layer of lead
trillions of miles thick without being diverted from their course,
according to the Nobel citation.
   ``The work was the first pioneering effort to essentially put
together an experiment in which neutrinos ... which very rarely
interact in matter at all ... interact,'' said Schwartz, awakened
with the news at his home in San Francisco.
   The physicists also were cited for discovering the muon neutrino.
   The academy said their work ``opened entirely new opportunities
for research into the innermost structure and dynamics of matter.''
   Schwartz, 55, who left physics to run his own company
specializing in computer communication, came up with the idea to
use a neutron beam to study radioactive decay after other types of
beams failed to work.
   Schwartz once wrote that he discussed the problem with some
colleagues during a coffee break in 1959, but they were left
stymied.
   ``That night it came to me. It was incredibly simple. All we had
to do was to use neutrinos,'' he wrote in a scientific journal.
   The prize-winning experiment ``was completed and published in
1961. Those poor guys in Stockholm have been puzzling over it ever
since and finally decided it was good stuff,'' said Lederman, 66,
director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia,
Ill.
   Steinberger, 67, a German-born naturalized American, said he had
given up hope of winning.
   ``It was not such that you immediately had to give it a Nobel
Prize. I would have thought it would be honored that way at one
time or another, but I had given up,'' he said in an interview at
the CERN research laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, where he works.
   The three were faculty members at Columbia University at the
time of their research.
   Deisenhofer, Huber and Michel were cited ``for the determination
of the three-dimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction
center.''
   The work led to better understanding of photosynthesis not only
in bacteria, but in algae and higher plants as well, the academy
said.
   In 1982, Michel was able to obtain proteins in a crystalline
form that allowed their structure to be determined. The scientists
worked together to determine their structure.
   Deisenhofer, 45, studied at the Max Planck Institute for
Biochemistry. He now works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
in Dallas.
   Huber, 51, is still at the Max Planck institute in Martinsried,
West Germany. Michel, 42, works at the Max Planck Institute for
Biophysics in Frankfurt.
   The chemistry and physics prizes completed the awarding of the
six 1988 Nobel prizes. Each carries a $390,000 award.
   The U.N. peacekeeping forces won the peace prize, Egyptian
novelist Naguib Mahfouz took the literature prize, and French
economist Maurice Allais won the economics prize.
   American researchers Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitzhings
shared the medicine prize with Sir James W. Black of Britain.
