   The Nobel Foundation, after
record-breaking profits, is raising the amount of the annual Nobel
Prizes by 15 percent to $428,000, the head of the foundation said
Tuesday.
   Executive Director Stig Ramel said the foundation established by
Alfred Nobel's 1896 testament saw its profits rise by 29 percent,
yielding $5.6 million to finance the five prizes and the
arrangements for awarding them.
   Last year's prize was worth $362,000, up 8 percent from 1986.
   The foundation administers the endowment which finances the
Nobel prizes in literature, physics, chemistry and medicine. The
Riksbank, the central bank, created and funded the Nobel Memorial
prize for economics in 1968.
   The laureates are chosen independently by the Swedish Academy of
Sciences, the Academy of Arts and Letters and the Karolinska
Institute. The Nobel committee of the Norwegian parliament awards
the prestigious Peace Prize.
   The prize money is awarded in the currency of the winner's
choice according to the exchange rate on Dec. 10, the day of the
annual award ceremony. The prize is divided if there is more than
one laureate in a category. Last year nine winners shared the six
prizes.
   Ramel told The Associated Press the jump in the value of assets
was largely due to floating the foundation's real estate company on
the Stockholm stock exchange last year.
   Ramel said the foundation's capital this year ``for the first
time is substantially worth more'' than when the prizes were
created after Nobel's death. The first prizes were awarded in 1901.
   Nobel, who invented dynamite, bequeathed the equivalent of about
$150 million in his will to those who ``have conferred the greatest
benefit on mankind.''
   But Nobel stipulated the capital be invested in what he
considered safe fixed-income bonds, which later proved
unprofitable. For 50 years the foundation lost money and the prize
progressively shrank.
   ``The foundation lost about two-thirds of the capital,'' he said.
   Since 1953 the regulations surrounding the Nobel capital has
gradually loosened, enabling the foundation to be more active in
the Swedish economy.
   ``That is why we started the real estate company last year,''
Ramel said. ``Fortunately we were unharmed by the stock market
crash last October.''
