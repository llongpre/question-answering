   Here are excerpts from the citation
from the Swedish Academy, which awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in
literature to Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz on Thursday:
   Nobel Prize winner in literature, 1988: Naguib Mahfouz, who,
through works rich in nuance _ now clear-sightedly realistic, now
evocatively ambiguous _ has formed an Arabian narrative art that
applies to all mankind.
   Mahfouz's great and decisive achievement is as the writer of
novels and short stories. His production has meant a powerful
upswing for the novel as a genre and for the deveopment of the
literary language in Arabic-speaking cultural circles. The range is
however greater than that. His work speaks to us all.
   Mahfouz really made his name with the big Trilogy (1956-57). In
the center is a family and its vicissitudes from the end of the
1910s to the middle of the 1940s. The series of novels has
autobiographical elements. The depiction of individuals relates
very clearly to intellectual, social and political conditions. On
the whole through his writings Mahfouz has exerted considerable
influence in his country.
   The theme of the unusual novel ``Children of Gebelawi'' (1959)
is man's everlasting search for spiritual values. ... Different
norm systems are confronted with tension in the description of the
conflict between good and evil.
   ``A Houseboat on the Nile'' (1966 _ not yet translated into
English) is an example of Mahfouz's impressive novellas. Here
metaphysical conversations are carried on in the borderland between
reality and illusion. At the same time the text forms itself into a
comment on the intellectual climate in the country.
   In the volume of selected stories ``God's World'' (1973) ... the
artistic treatment of the existential questions is forceful and the
formal solutions often striking.
   There has been a tendency to divide Mahfouz's writings into a
number of periods, e.g. a historical, a realistic and a
metaphysical-mystical. Naturally this has not happened without
reason. However, the illumination throughout of human life in
general should also be emphasized.
