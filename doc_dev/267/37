   The Nobel committee met in secret today to
choose the winner of the 1988 Peace Prize, with President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev mentioned as leading
contenders.
   The five committee members were considering candidates drawn
from an initial list of 97. The winner will be announced Thursday.
   VG, an Oslo tabloid, speculated that Reagan and Gorbachev would
share the prize for signing a treaty banning intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   The paper said if they won, the leaders would hold a summit in
Oslo in December when they come to accept the award.
   Others mentioned for the $390,000 prize ranged from the U.N.
peacekeeping forces in Lebanon to the head of the International
Soccer Federation, Joao Havelange of Brazil.
   Egil Aarvik, chairman of the Nobel committee, said U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was not on the secret
list of candidates because he was not nominated by the Feb. 1
deadline.
   As stipulated in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, whose fortune
was built on his invention of dynamite, the Peace Prize is
announced in Oslo, Norway, while the other prizes are announced in
Stockholm.
   The Karolinska Institute Nobel Assembly will announce the
medicine prize on Oct. 17. The next day the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences names the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science,
created by the Bank of Sweden in 1968 to complement the five prizes
funded by Nobel's estate.
   The winners of the physics and the chemistry prizes will be
announced by the science academy Oct. 19.
   The Swedish Academy, which awards the literature prize, does not
give a date in advance. By tradition, it announces its winner at
exactly 1 p.m. on a Thursday in September or October.
   Helge Pharo, a consultant for the Nobel committee, said the list
of candidates for the Peace Prize was reduced to fewer than a half
dozen. Pharo said the original list included 74 individuals and 23
organizations.
   The decision is by consensus. There is no vote, he said.
   Aarvik said Tuesday evening that a Peace Prize winner will be
announced at 2 p.m. (9 a.m. EDT) Thursday, making it clear there
will be a winner this year, Norwegian national news agency NTB
reported.
   Some years, the committee has chosen not to award the prize.
   Besides Aarvik, a retired journalist and former Cabinet
minister, the other committee members are author Gidske Anderson;
history professor Francis Sejersted; former Prime Minister Odvar
Nordli and Gunnar J. Staalsett, a priest and head of the
Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation.
   Last year, the committee awarded the Peace Prize to President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica for his Central American peace plan.
   Seventeen of the 87 laureates named since the first prize was
awarded in 1901 have been Americans, more than any other
nationality.
