   Two American doctors won the Nobel
Prize in medicine Monday for their work in transplanting human
organs and bone marrow, revolutionary procedures that have saved
thousands of lives over three decades.
   Joseph E. Murray, 71, who performed the first successful organ
transplant - a kidney - and E. Donnall Thomas, 70, who pioneered
bone marrow transplants to cure leukemia, will share the $704,000
(4 million kronor) prize.
   Most Nobel Prizes in medicine have been awarded for basic
research, not for clinical treatment.
   ``I really thought this work was too clinical to ever win the
prize,'' Thomas said from his home in Bellevue, Wash. He is
affiliated with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, one of the world's major bone marrow transplant
institutions.
   But in the case of transplants, the clinical treatment was a
radical advance.
   ``This was astonishing, to take one organ and move it to another
person. It was science fiction 30 years ago,'' said Dr. Carl-Gustav
Groth, a member of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute,
which awarded the prize.
   Swedish dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel declared in his 1896 will
that the prizes should be given to those who have ``conferred the
greatest benefit on mankind.''
   The Nobel Assembly said Murray's and Thomas' discoveries had met
the requirement by saving tens of thousands of lives, providing
cures for such fatal diseases as leukemia, liver malignancy,
coronary artery disease and aplastic anemia.
   The doctors did their groundbreaking research separately during
the 1950s and 1960s, but they began their careers together at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where Murray remains
affilitated although he stopped performing surgery four years ago.
   ``He was a resident in medicine and I was a resident in
surgery,'' said Murray, who was in San Francisco on Monday for a
medical conference. ``This was after World War II.
   ``We both started working in transplants together, but from
different angles. It's marvelous to share it with him.''
   Murray, a native of Milford, Mass., mastered the problem of
organ rejection and in 1954 made the first successful organ
transplant, a kidney from one identical twin to another that
functioned for seven years. In earlier attempts, implanted organs
were rejected within hours or days.
   Thomas was also able to diminish the severe reaction that bone
marrow grafts can cause in recipients. He performed the first human
bone marrow transplant in 1956, and his procedure now is the
standard treatment for leukemia patients.
   It also is used to treat a variety of cancers and inherited
diseases, and researchers are investigating its potential use in
treating AIDS and other diseases.
   The Nobel Assembly said the idea of transplanting organs has
been discussed for thousands of years, and unsuccessful attempts
were made at the turn of the century. A medieval Italian painting
shows doctors trying to sew a black man's leg onto a white man's
body.
   Leading modern scientists, including 1960 Nobel medicine
laureate Sir Peter Medawar of Great Britain, had believed organ
transplant was biologically impossible.
   In the late 1940s, Medawar said a biological force existed that
``forever will inhibit transplantation from one individual to
another.''
   Groth said now even successful transplants from animals to
humans are not far away, but rejection by the immune system is
still the main problem.
   Murray's transplant work opened ``the field for other organs
such as liver, pancreas and heart,'' said the award statement.
   Up to 50,000 organ transplants are performed each year, 75
percent of them involving kidneys.
   Leukemia once was always fatal. Thomas' procedure now produces a
cure in 50 percent of all cases, and in 80 percent of childhood
cases. In 1987 about 4,000 patients received the treatment.
   ``Murray's and Thomas' discoveries are crucial for those tens of
thousands of severely ill patients who either can be cured, or be
given a decent life when other treatment methods are without
success,'' said the 50-member Nobel Assembly at Sweden's largest
and oldest medical university.
   Americans have won or shared 69 of the 142 Nobel medicine prizes
since 1901. Great Britain is second with 17 winners.
   Last year, the prize also went to Americans. J. Michael Bishop
and Harold E. Varmus won it for discovering a family of genes that
has helped scientists understand how cancer develops.
   The medicine or physiology prize is the first of five endowed by
Nobel to be awarded this month.
   The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Oct. 15 in Oslo, Norway.
Prizes for physics and chemistry discoveries will be announced Oct.
17 in Stockholm. The date for the literature prize has not been
announced.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, created by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1969, will be awarded in Stockholm on
Oct. 16.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.
