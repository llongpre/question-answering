   Novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the first Arab to
win the Nobel Prize in Literature, is garnering both praise and
criticism in his native land.
   Some said he should have received the award long ago. Others
criticized his support of the 1979 Camp David peace agreement
between Egypt and Israel and his book attacking the late President
Gamal Abdel Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist policies.
   Mahfouz, the first Arab writer to win the award in its 87-year
history, has vividly portrayed poverty in Egypt. The Swedish
Academy honored him in Stockholm Thursday with the 1988 prize for
literature for advancing the art of the novel, a relatively new
genre in Arabic literature.
   One of his books, ``Children of Gebelawi,'' has been banned
since 1959 in his own country because it offended religious
leaders. But the Swedish Academy cited the book as it awarded the
prize, saying,``Different norm systems are confronted with tension
in the description of the conflict between good and evil.''
   Mahfouz, 76, son of a Cairo civil servant, said he was ``very
happy and thankful for the Arab world'' for receiving the award,
worth $390,000 and inevitable royalties and prestige.
   ``I congratulate the Egyptian people that one of its small
people won a big award, (but) it's not too big for Egypt,'' he
said. ``I hope this will be the first step for our literary
generations. We have taken a lot and must now give.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Culture Minister Farouk
Hosni sent Mahfouz congratulating telegrams. In Jerusalem, Israel
Television reported Foreign Minister Shimon Peres also sent Mahfouz
a congratulatory cable.
   Poet Hamid Saeed, secretary-general of the General Federation of
Arab Writers and editor-in-chief of the Iraqi newspaper al-Thawra
in Baghdad, said Mahfouz has long deserved the prize.
   Farouk Mustafa, a professor at the University of Chicago's
Oriental Institute, said: ``He should have won it 20 years ago,
actually. I think the committee was negligent in the first to
ignore the longest literary tradition in the whole world, which is
the Arabic literary tradition.''
   But Fakhri Kawar, one of Jordan's best-known novelists, said he
believed Mahfouz was honored partly because of his relatively
noncritical position toward Israel.
   ``I would like to point out that (Mahfouz's) relationship with
Israel and his writings on Camp David have contributed greatly to
push Zionism and help him win that award,'' Kawar said.
   Nevertheless, Kawar described Mahfoud as ``a great writer, a
giant one. ... He storified Egypt's history in his best sellers,
(which) studied carefully the different walks of life in Egypt.''
   Hosni Frez, president of Jordan's Writers Association, attacked
Mahfouz for opposing Egypt's late president and advocate of Arab
unity, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   ``Not for 1,400 years did we have a single man who was equal to
Nasser, and this man was always against him,'' Frez said.
   In all, Mahfouz's works include 40 novels and collections of
short stories, many of them available in English and other
languages.
   The Nobel prizes in medicine, physics, chemistry and economics
will be announced next week. U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel
Peace Prize, announced Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway.
