   Maurice Allais, a prolific theorist
whose ideas on balancing supply and demand helped rebuild the
French economy after World War II, won the Nobel Prize for
economics Tuesday.
   Allais, a Paris shopkeeper's son, became mentor to a generation
of economists. He developed formulas to enable large enterprises,
particularly public ones, to keep an economy in balance by
regulating prices and allocating their resources.
   After the award was announced, the 77-year-old economist said he
had given up hope of ever winning the prize, which was established
20 years ago. ``I've been mentioned so many times before, I just
didn't think I would get it,'' he said at from apartment in a Paris
suburb.
   The poverty and unemployment Allais saw in the United States, on
a visit during the Great Depression of the 1930s, turned him to
economics from the engineering career for which he had trained.
   ``He is a giant in economic theoretic analysis,'' said Assar
Lindbeck, who heads the committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences that awards the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
   ``He's been under consideration for a long time,'' Lindbeck
said. ``It took a long time to investigate him because of the great
volume and complexity of his works.''
   According to the citation, Allais was honored ``for his
pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient
utilization of resources.''
   This year's prizes are worth about $390,000. Allais is the first
French national to win the economics award, according to the
official list, but 1983 laureate Gerard Debreu of the United States
was born in Calais. He was a student of Allais.
   Allais did his major work in Nazi-occupied France during the
war. He published ``In Search of an Economic Discipline'' in 1943
and ``Economy and Interest'' in 1947.
   Of his change in careers, the laureate said Tuesday: ``My
motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to improve
the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of the
problems facing the world. That's what led me into economics. I saw
it as a way of helping people.''
   Jacques Levy, director of the Ecole Nationale de Mines, said:
``He was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in postwar
France between 1945 and 1968, all the people who were in charge of
the biggest enterprises and of the state planning apparatus.''
   Allais taught at Levy's institution until his retirement nine
years ago, and is not widely known outside France. He has continued
research and writing.
   His theories are expressed in complicated mathematical formulas.
They form the basis for sorting out the thousands of independent
factors involved in marketing goods and services: How much should a
train ticket cost, for example, or what is the right price for a
kilowatt-hour of electricity?
   Levy said the idea is to keep supply and demand in balance, and
according to the Allais theories, ``it's the government's role to
organize this fair competition.''
   The academy said the French economist's work, in some ways,
parallels that of earlier Nobel laureates Paul Samuelson of the
United States and Sir John Hicks of Britain
   Allais says he is not from any mold.
   ``If you will permit me, I don't fit into any category except my
own,'' he declared Tuesday. ``I am not a monetarist and I am not a
Keynesian. On certain points I agree with each.''
   Samuelson was once quoted as saying a generation of economic
theory would have taken a different course if Allais' earliest
writings had been in English.
   Americans have dominated the prize. Fifteen Americans are among
the 25 economics laureates and five are British.
   Allais has published constantly since the war and has at least
36 titles to his credit, including works on history and physics. He
is an officer of France's Legion of Honor.
   In 1959 he experimented with a pendulum of his own invention,
conducting 220,000 tests to demonstrate that Earth's gravity is
neither constant nor always oriented in the same direction.
   ``He has a vitality which seems to continue all his life,'' said
Tord Ganelius, secretary-general of the economics prize committee.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize, announced
Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway, and the award in literature went to
Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the first Arabic-language writer
to win it.
   On Monday, American researchers Gertrude B. Elion and George H.
Hitchings shared the medicine award with Sir James W. Black of
Britain for helping develop drugs for use against leukemia, high
blood pressure, AIDS and other diseases.
   Prize winners in chemistry and physics prizes will be announced
Wednesday.
   Economics is the only one of the six Nobel prizes not stipulated
in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of
dynamite, who died in 1896.
   It was established by the Bank of Sweden and first awarded in
1969. The other prizes have been given since 1901.
