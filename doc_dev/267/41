   The awarding of the Nobel Prize for
literature to Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz is being interpreted
as a boost for Arab-Israeli relations and a good omen for Middle
East peace.
   The 76-year-old author, who on Thursday became the first Arab
writer to win the award, has been attacked in the past for
supporting the U.S.-brokered Camp David agreement between Egypt and
Israel.
   Egyptians compare Mahfouz with England's Charles Dickens and
France's Victor Hugo.
   But he calls himself only a ``third-rate writer,'' naming
William Shakespeare and Leo Tolstoy as first-rate writers, and
Dickens and George Bernard Shaw as second-rate.
   Mahfouz's admirers laud his stubborn advocacy of the ideals of
democracy.
   While his critics speak out openly, his supporters seek
anonymity, saying the movement for peace in the Middle East remains
largely defenseless against terrorist violence and political
maneuvering.
   ``Mahfouz's glorious gain will fire the minds of generations of
Arab writers to emulate his example and stress Arab-Jewish peace,''
said one admirer, a highly placed Arab official.
   The Swedish Academy said that Mahfouz's work, which includes 40
novels, had advanced the art of the novel, a relatively new genre
in Arabic literature.
   Several Arab writers contended that Mahfouz was favored for the
prize because of writings that allegedly are pro-Israeli. Jordanian
novelist Fakhry Kaawar insisted that Mahfouz had ``contributed
greatly to push Zionism.''
   Many Arab intellectuals believe the Swedish Nobel Prize
committee comes under a strong Jewish influence.
   Bahrain's information minister, Tariq al-Moayyed, said Mahfouz's
award was a source of pride for Egypt and all Arabs.
   After decrying the monarchy of King Farouk and the British
occupation of Egypt in his early books, Mahfouz resorted to
allegory to condemn dictatorial practices in his country that were
being justified on nationalistic grounds.
   He never accorded the late King Farouk any praise.
   At one point, Mahfouz lamented Egypt's loss of identity,
depicting the nation in a novel called ``The Road'' as an
illegimate boy moving from a small town to the crowded capital in
search of his father. The boy aimlessly roams through Cairo, turns
into a criminal and ends up dying on the gallows.
   In another novel, ``Miramar,'' Mahfouz took a more obvious swipe
at dictatorship, portraying Egypt as a maid at a boarding house
called Miramar, with a clientele of suitors representing former
feudalists, emerging revolutionaries, counterrevolutionaries and
opportunists.
   The maid rejects all the suitors as deceitful and awards her
favors to a poor but honest newspaper delivery boy.
   After the defeat of the Arabs in the 1967 war with Israel,
Mahfouz almost totally shed his allegory and confronted Gamal Abdel
Nasser's police state more directly.
   ``Al-Karnak,'' a novel about arrests and torture of decent
Egyptians by hated intelligence officers, has a theme that carries
echoes of the Gestapo in Nazi Germany.
   One novel cited by the Nobel judges is ``Children of Gebelawi,''
written in 1959 and still banned in Egypt. The characters are based
on Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and a modern scientist.
   The Swedish Academy described it as an ``allegory of humanity's
historic destiny under the great monotheistic founders of
religion.''
   Mahfouz's firm belief in the oneness of humanity is the basis of
his support for ending centuries of Arab hatred of the Jews.
   But he also insists that the Palestinians should be allowed to
carve out their own destiny in an independent state.
