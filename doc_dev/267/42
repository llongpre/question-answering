   Naguib Mahfouz, 1988 Nobel Prize winner for
literature, declined police protection after a Moslem
fundamentalist leader called him an apostate and said he should be
killed, his daughter said Thursday.
   The Moslem cleric, or imam, is Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind
sheik who decreed to his followers that it was not a sin to murder
President Anwar Sadat. Sadat was assassinated by Moslem
fundamentalists Oct. 6, 1981, but Abdel-Rahman was acquitted of
murder charges.
   Mahfouz's eldest daughter, Om Kalthoum, said in a telephone
interview that police had offered her father protection after the
death call last month but that he declined it. She added he had not
changed his lifestyle in any way.
   Mahfouz, the first Arab to win the Nobel prize for literature,
was not immediately available for comment.
   Abdel-Rahman, who is under arrest after being charged with
instigating an anti-government demonstration in the southern town
of Fayoum, said in an interview with the Kuwaiti newpaper Al-Anbaa
April 13 that Mahfouz had turned his back on Islam and therefore
should be killed under Islamic laws.
   Abdel-Rahman also said Mahfouz, 77, should have been killed a
long time ago after writing ``Children of Gebelawi,'' which is
banned in Egypt because one of its characters resembles God.
   The interview did not appear in Egypt and had no immediate
impact. But on April 21, Moussa Sabry, a columnist in the daily
Al-Akhbar newspaper, warned security authorities that
Abdel-Rahman's threat was real.
   ``Let me tell you that the life of our great writer is
threatened by assassination, this is a public announcement that he
can be killed,'' Sabry wrote. ``What are the legal and security
measures that should be taken in this case?''
   When an international uproar arose over the novel ``Satanic
Verses'' by Salman Rushdie, under death threats from Iran for
alleged blasphemy, Mahfouz told The Associated Press that freedom
of expression should be protected at all costs.
   He said he had not read Rushdie's book but that anyone who
disagreed with its contents had the right to respond to it in
newspapers or books. He said Iran's death threat was wrong and only
harmed the image of Islam in the world.
   Mahfouz says he is a Moslem, although he does not observe
religious practices diligently.
   Author of more than 40 novels and several collections of short
stories, Mahfouz was the first Arab to win the Nobel prize for
literature. The writer's health is very frail and he was unable to
accept the award personally last December.
