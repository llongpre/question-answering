   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won
the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize on Monday for easing international
tensions, but claimed it as an endorsement of wrenching changes he
has made at home.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the 59-year-old Soviet leader
displayed a ``leading role in the peace process which today
characterizes important parts of the international community.''
   ``Words fail one at such moments. I am moved,'' Gorbachev said
in a television interview.
   ``I perceive this action of the most authoritative organization
of the global community first of all not in personal terms, but as
recognition of the significance of the immense cause of perestroika
for the destiny of the entire world.''
   Gorbachev has been criticized at home because some of his social
and economic reforms, called perestroika, have led to bloody ethnic
rioting, food shortages, and demands by most Soviet republics for
independence.
   ``We know that there are great problems (in the Soviet Union),
but that is not what he got his prize for,'' said Gidske Anderson,
leader of the five-person Nobel Committee. ``The big thing that is
happening in the world is the reconciliation of the superpowers.''
   ``If you will read the text you will see we are talking mainly
about international policy,'' she said.
   The committee's citation said the ``greater openness (Gorbachev)
has brought about in Soviet society has also helped promote
international trust.''
   The committee said Gorbachev had made many contributions to the
``dramatic changes'' in East-West relationships since he came to
power in 1985:
   ``Confrontation has been replaced by negotiations. Old European
nation states have regained freedom. The arms race is slowing down
and we see a definite and active process in the direction of arms
control and disarmament.''
   Gorbachev told a Norwegian TV interviewer his reforms were
popular outside the Soviet Union because ``the world was ripe for
change.
   ``It had grown tired of the Cold War, the arms race, the
hardships resulting from an overload of current problems facing the
world community,'' he said.
   In the past five years, the Soviet Union has agreed to reduce
nuclear and conventional armed forces, helped settle regional
conflicts in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and withdrawn its
forces from Afghanistan.
   Many world leaders praised the award, but several said they
hoped it would lead to even more freedom in the Soviet Union.
   ``If this prize contributes to the peaceful and quiet transition
of the Soviet Union to a society of equal nations and citizens, we
welcome it warmly,'' said Vaclav Havel, a former dissident who
became Czechoslovakia's president after the Soviet Union eased its
grip on the East bloc.
   Former President Reagan said Gorbachev is ``sincere in his
effort to make the world safer'' and ``is dedicated to doing what
must be done for the good of his people.''
   President Bush called Gorbachev ``a courageous force for
peaceful change in the world.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the choice
``terrific.'' And French President Francois Mitterrand said
Gorbachev was ``the decisive factor in the easing of tensions in
the world.''
   Some Soviet citizens were less enthusiastic about the honor for
Gorbachev.
   ``I don't know much about politics, but what I see in the
stores, I hold the government responsible for,'' said Lyova
Likacheva, a 35-year-old Moscow factory worker. ``And what I see in
the stores is nothing - they're empty.''
   The 71st Peace Prize was the first to a Soviet leader. U.S.
presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson won the award in
1906 and 1919 respectively.
   Gorbachev is the second Soviet nobel peace laureate. Dissident
Andrei Sakahorov won the 1975 prize, but was not allowed to accept
it until last year.
   Gorbachev said he would personally accept the award, worth about
$700,000, this December in Oslo.
   The peace prize, first awarded in 1901, was endowed by Alfred
Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite. It is always presented in
Oslo on the Dec. 10 anniversary of his 1896 death.
   Nobel endowed four other prizes, in medicine, literature,
physics and chemistry, all awarded in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1968, will be awarded Tuesday. The Nobel
physics and chemistry prizes will be awarded Wednesday.
   Last week, Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the prize
for literature. Two American doctors, Joseph E. Murray and E.
Donnall Thomas, won the prize in medicine for pioneering organ and
bone marrow transplants.
