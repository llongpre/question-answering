<HEAD>Dissident Academy Members Speak Out, Welcome Choice of Cela</HEAD>

   Two dissident members partly lifted the
veil of secrecy on the Swedish Academy Friday and said they had
lobbied for years to give the Nobel Prize for literature to Spanish
writer Camilo Jose Cela.
   Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten boycotted the vote of the
18-member Academy because of a dispute over its refusal to condemn
death threats against British author Salman Rushdie for allegedly
blaspheming Islam in his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The Academy's deliberations are protected by Swedish secrecy
laws for 50 years and members are bound by an even stricter code of
silence forbidding comments on decisons.
   Ekman, Gyllensten and a third dissident member, Werner
Aspenstrom, handed in letters of resignation, but the academy
rejected the move because members are elected for life.
   There was no immediate comment from the Academy on the comments
by Ekman and Gyllensten, who said they welcomed the choice of Cela,
73, announced Thursday.
   ``He has been one of my main candidates for some years back. He
is a very original writer with a very broad range,'' Gyllensten
said on Swedish Radio. ``I think he will be regarded as one of the
finer choices of Nobel laureates the Academy has made.''
   ``I have been one of those working for this prize and I'm very
glad that it came about,'' Ekman told the radio.
   Olof Lagercrantz, author and a former editor-in-chief of the
influential Dagens Nyheter daily, said the Nobel Prize is ``a
lottery unworthy of the world of the spirit'' and should be
discontinued.
   Asked his view of Cela, he said, ``I have no view at all. I have
not read a single line by him. It is so silly this prize that you
cannot have a view on it.''
