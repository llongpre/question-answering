   Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel
Prize in literature, is as unruffled by death threats from Moslem
fundamentalists as he is by his new wealth and international
acclaim.
   ``At my age, there's no fear about being killed,'' said the
frail 77-year-old writer as he sat at his usual table by the
picture window of Ali Baba, a cafe overlooking downtown Cairo's
busy Tahrir Square. ``I refused police protection because this
would tie down my freedom of movement.''
   As he spoke, he slowly sipped Turkish coffee, without sugar
because he's diabetic.
   Mahfouz, the first author who writes in Arabic to receive the
Nobel literary prize, is a man of routine, and his routine has not
changed in the month since an Egyptian fundamentalist sheik
declared him an apostate, a rebel against his religion.
   Islam decrees that he must repent or die, said Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, who had been acquitted of charges he instigated the
1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat with a similar
proclamation.
   ``Security authorities say there are some young extremists who
might act on Abdel-Rahman's words,'' Mahfouz said. ``They advised
me to accept protection.''
   Abdel-Rahman's declaration did not arouse the reaction among
many Moslems abroad as did condemnation of Moslem-born British
writer Salman Rushdie.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said his novel ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemes Islam and ordered the author's death. The book has been
banned in predominantly Moslem countries, including Egypt.
   On this day, as always, Mahfouz walked alone to the Ali Baba
cafe, about a half-hour from his home, where he lives with his
wife, Atyatallah, and two grown daughters. He travels the same
route every day and said he has no intention of changing it,
despite the anxiety of family and security authorities.
   The author of works including 40 novels still goes to his Friday
literary meetings at a Nile riverside restaurant and to Thursday
get-togethers with a poet, an actor and three other close friends.
   ``Nothing has changed for me,'' Mahfouz said about the impact of
the Nobel Prize money, a $390,000 award that his daughters traveled
to Sweden in December to receive. Mahfouz's delicate health,
including impaired eyesight and hearing, kept him at home.
   He said he divided the money equally among himself, his wife and
his two daughters. Mahfouz donated his quarter to a charity
organization at Al-Ahram, a state-run newspaper and Mahfouz's
long-time employer.
   Al-Ahram was at the center of a controversy 30 years ago that
led to Mahfouz's current friction with fundamentalists. In 1959,
the newspaper's serialization of Mahfouz's ``Children of Gebelawi''
drew the attention of the sheiks at Al-Azhar, the Cairo institution
that is Islam's center of theology.
   They immediately banned it as blasphemous and spoke of trying
Mahfouz for apostasy because the book wrongly depicted biblical
figures.
   The ban never was lifted, but Mahfouz was left in peace. After
his Nobel triumph, Al-Azhar leaders received Mahfouz warmly at the
venerated institute.
   A new threat arose in early April with Sheik Abdel-Rahman's
``fatwa'' or religious opinion that the book proved Mahfouz had
abandoned Islam and unless he repented must be killed under Islamic
law.
   Nobody outside Fayoum, Abdel-Rahman's hometown southwest of
Cairo, knew of the proclamation until the blind cleric repeated the
opinion in an interview published on April 13 with the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Anbaa.
   Abdel-Rahman had been arrested a week earlier for leading an
anti-government demonstration in Fayoum.
   The interview was not published in Egypt and had no noticeable
effect.
   Mahfouz was among Moslems who condemned Khomeini's call for
Rushdie's death, saying it amounted to ``terrorism ... against
humanity because it is against thought and against human rights.''
   Nevertheless, he said Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' was
repugnant and that he supported a boycott of its publishers.
   Mahfouz said Abdel-Rahman's condemnations followed a campaign
against Mahfouz's writings by fundamentalist publications that
began soon after he won the Nobel Prize in October.
   The campaign ``was a sort of provocation, and the security
authorities became more worried after Abdel-Rahman's comments,''
Mahfouz said. ``My wife and daughters also asked me to change my
lifestyle.
   ``But I can't.''
