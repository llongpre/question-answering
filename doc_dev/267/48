   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize today for his decisive role in the dramatic
rapprochement between East and West - leadership that helped end
the Cold War, free the East bloc and slow the arms race.
   In awarding the 59-year-old Soviet leader the $700,000 prize,
the Norwegian Nobel Committee also cited him for allowing greater
openness in his homeland.
   Gorbachev said today the prize - the first to a superpower chief
executive since President Woodrow Wilson won in 1919 - recognized
the success of perestroika - his government's reform policies.
   ``Words fail one at such moments. I am moved,'' the official
Soviet news agency Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   ``When we were starting our perestroika,'' Gorbachev said, ``we
knew that it would have vast significance to all countries.'' He
said he will personally accept the award in Oslo.
   In its citation, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said it decided
to give Gorbachev the prize ``for his leading role in the peace
process.''
   The committee noted ``dramatic changes'' have occurred over the
past few years in the relationship between East and West, saying:
``Confrontation has been replaced by negotiations. Old European
nation states have regained freedom. The arms race is slowing down
and we see a definite and active process in the direction of arms
control and disarmament.''
   The committee said several factors played a role in the historic
changes, but this year it was singling out Gorbachev ``for his many
and decisive contributions.''
   ``This peace process,'' the citation said, ``...opens up new
possibilities for the world community to solve its pressing
problems across ideological, religious, historical and cultural
dividing lines.''
   Gidske Anderson, leader of the Nobel Committee, refused to say
if the prize was meant to help Gorbachev stay in power, as the same
domestic policies that have democratized political life also have
led to instability.
   ``If you will read the text you will see we are talking mainly
about international policy,'' Ms. Anderson said.
   ``The big thing that is happening in the world is the
reconciliation of the superpowers. We are very happy to come with a
laureate who has such great significance.''
   Gorbachev is the second Soviet to win the Peace Prize. The first
was nuclear scientist and human rights activist Andrei Sakharov,
who won in 1975. Sakharov, who died in December, could not accept
the award for 14 years - until Gorbachev freed him from internal
exile and allowed him to travel.
   Sakharov's widow Yelena Bonner, criticized Gorbachev last week
in a Norwegian newspaper, comparing him to Napoleon, who conquered
Europe and made himself an emperor. Today she had no comment on
Gorbachev's win.
   Initial reaction today favored the choice of Gorbachev for the
prize.
   In Washington, President Bush praised the Soviet leader, saying
the United States ``continues to work with the Soviet Union to
promote regional and international peace.''
   ``President Mikhail Gorbachev has been a courageous force for
peaceful change in the world,'' Bush said. ``East-West relations
hold greater promise for peace and world stability today than at
any time in the last 45 years.''
   Former President Ronald Reagan said Gorbachev won the award
because of his ``bold and courageous leadership'' and added: ``I
congratulate my friend on his wonderful recognition of his
accomplishments.''
   ``Since our first meeting in Geneva nearly five years ago, I
have found Mikhail Gorbachev to be sincere in his effort to make
the world safer,'' especially by reducing nuclear weapons
stockpiles, Reagan said in a statement.
   Lech Walesa, the 1983 peace laureate who is campaigning to
become Poland's first popularly elected president, sent
congratulations to Gorbachev, saying he was pleased the world has
recognized his ``great work.''
   The Solidarity leader wished Gorbachev ``further persistence and
successes on the road to democracy.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said the selection
of Gorbachev was ``terrific.''
   And Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germany has a special reason to
thank Gorbachev for lifting Soviet objections to German
unification. ``We Germans ... have grounds to be thankful to you
and are delighted along with your countrymen over this award,''
Kohl said.
   President Vaclev Havel of Czechoslovakia, who had been
considered a leading candidate for the prize, said:
   ``Mikhail Gorbachev contributed significantly to the
acceleration of the inevitable changes in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe and certainly deserves the prize. If this prize
contributes to the peaceful and quiet transition of the Soviet
Union to a society of equal nations and citizens, we welcome it
warmly.''
   In its citation, the Nobel Committee said the ``greater
openness'' Gorbachev ``has brought about in Soviet society has also
helped promote international trust.''
   However, the changes Gorbachev has encouraged at home have been
accompanied by bloody ethnic conflicts in Armenia, Azerbaijan and
other areas. And his economic reforms - the transformation to a
market-based system is still far off - have led to shortages of
consumer goods.
   The prize was endowed by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of
dynamite, and has been awarded since 1901. He established four
other prizes, in medicine, literature, physics and chemistry, which
are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1968, will be awarded Tuesday. The Nobel
physics and chemistry prizes will be awarded Wednesday.
   Last week, Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the prize
for literature. Two American doctors, Joseph E. Murray and E.
Donnall Thomas, won the prize in medicine for pioneering organ and
bone marrow transplants.
   The awards are presented in Oslo and Stockholm on Dec. 10, the
anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.
