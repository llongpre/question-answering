   A new TV movie on Richard Nixon's final days
as president won't seem tough enough to his detractors, say
journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
   ``Nixon-haters won't be happy with the portrait because you're
feeling sorry for him,'' Woodward said in the Oct. 28 issue of TV
Guide magazine. ``You see the crushing loss, and it's just very,
very clear that ... it hurt.''
   The movie is based on Woodward and Bernstein's book, ``The Final
Days,'' which was published shortly after the release of a film
based on their first book, ``All the President's Men.''
   When the book version of ``The Final Days'' came out, Bernstein
recalls, ``we were attacked on about every ground you can imagine.''
   The book, like the TV movie to be shown Oct. 29 on ABC, includes
a scene in which Nixon and then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
knelt on the rug in prayer.
   ``Our colleagues in the press had trouble believing that what we
had written was true. Particularly the scene about Kissinger and
Nixon,'' Bernstein said. ``Of course, everything in the book has
since been confirmed by the principals in their own memoirs.''

   Former astronaut Scott Carpenter says
humans need to consider ``a mission to planet Earth'' before
heading to other solar systems.
   ``The planet, our home, is in desperate need of intensive
care,'' he said Monday night at the University of
Wisconsin-Platteville. ``The future of everything we do depends on
this planet.''
   The mission to this planet is needed to combat the problems that
are endangering Earth's ecology, he said.
   Carpenter, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts on the
United States' first manned mission in space, said 30 million acres
of tropical rain forests are being destroyed each year, 70 million
acres of forest in the industrial north are badly damaged, new
deserts are being created and holes in the ozone layer are getting
larger.

   Lorin Maazel said he has agreed to extend his
contract as music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony to the end of
the 1995-96 season.
   The announcement was made Monday at a news conference in Berlin,
where Maazel said he was giving up his future conducting dates and
canceling about 40 scheduled recording sessions with the Berlin
Philharmonic Orchestra.
   Maazel, who is on the final week of a four-week tour to the
Soviet Union and Europe with the Pittsburgh orchestra, is extending
his tenure beyond his current contract, which expires at the end of
the 1991-92 season.
   In a telephone interview with The Pittsburgh Press, Maazel said
he will gradually increase his time with the Pittsburgh Symphony,
which he now leads in eight subscription weeks a season.
   Maazel was a top candidate for the job of chief conductor of the
Berlin Philharmonic. That post was awarded two weeks ago to Italian
conductor Claudio Abbado, music director of the Vienna State Opera,
who will succeed the late Herbert von Karajan.
   In addition to giving up his work with the Berlin orchestra,
Maazel said he would also give up his position as resident music
director of the Orchestre Nationale de France, effective Aug. 31,
1991.

   Pinetop Perkins received the key to his
Mississippi Delta hometown Tuesday as he was honored for 60 years
of boogie-woogie piano and soulful songs.
   ``It feels good to me,'' said Perkins, 76. ``One thing, it
brings back memories.''
   His mother died in Belzoni in 1963, and this is the first time
he's come back to his hometown since, Perkins said.
   In addition to receiving the key to the town from Mayor Tom
Turner Jr., Perkins' life work was praised in concert by the guest
of honor and his band, Little Mike and the Tornadoes.
   Perkins recalled the first time he heard blues on a juke joint
piano as a youngster.
   ``I listened at that, and I said, `I got eight fingers and two
thumbs _ I figure I can do that,'' he said.
   Perkins left Mississippi in his early 20s. His first stop was
Helena, Ark., where he was one of the King Biscuit Boys on the
``King Biscuit Flour Hour'' broadcasts, playing with Sonny Boy
Williamson. In the early 1960s, he settled in Chicago.

   A 25-year-old travel book written by
newly-named Nobel laureate Camilo Jose Cela is getting a new run.
   The University of Wisconsin Press plans to reprint the book by
Cela, the Spanish writer whose violent images sprang from the civil
war that killed more than a million of his countrymen.
   In the 25 years since the translated book ``Journey to
Alcarria'' was originally published, it has sold original 2,000
copies, officials said.
   The final copies of the original printing were sold Thursday,
the same day Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature.
   Press director Allen Fitchen said Monday plans have been made to
reprint 2,000 to 5,000 translated copies of ``Journey to Alcarria.''
   ``The world was caught by surprise that the Nobel Prize went to
Cela,'' Fichen said. ``We were caught by surprise that we had been
a publisher of a Nobel Prize winner. We're delighted.''
   The Swedish Academy cited Cela, 73, for his ``rich, intensive
prose, which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision
of man's vulnerability.'' It said his novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duate'' was the most popular Spanish fiction work since ``Don
Quixote.''
