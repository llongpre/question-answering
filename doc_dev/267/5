   The winner of this year's Nobel Prize in
literature, Camilo Jose Cela, is better known in his homeland for
his love of food, travel and women than for his 10 novels and
numerous short stories and travelogues.
   Cela received the Nobel Prize in literature today, becoming the
fifth Spaniard to do so.
   Although his best-known novels, ``The Family of Pascual Duarte''
and ``The Hive,'' have been successfully translated into films, he
is known to most Spaniards for his sojourns through Spain in a
Rolls Royce, for his love of crude expressions and for his
flamboyant lifestyle.
   The 73-year-old writer most recently made news when he publicly
acknowledged a romantic liaison with Marina Castano, a woman half
his age who is his muse and literary helpmate.
   Cela is separated but not divorced from his wife of many years
and has one son, Camilo Jose Cela Conde, who acknowledged last week
in a radio interview that it was difficult being the offspring of
such a public character.
   Ms. Castano said Cela still writes everything in longhand and
has no idea how to operate a typewriter or a word processor.
   Cela told reporters he was ``not really surprised'' by the news
he had received the award but said it could just as well have gone
to many other Spanish writers.
   ``But life is like a game of tennis, and this time I won,'' he
said.
   He said the $463,000 prize will ``come in very handy.''
   ``I'll use it to pay my debts, and believe me, I've got a lot of
them.''
   He said Spain has been overshadowed by Latin America in
literature for some time because of its ``foolish provincialism.''
   ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' from 1942, Cela's first novel,
was first published in Argentina because it was deemed too violent
and crude for Spain at the time.
   It tells the story in uncommonly straightforward language of a
rural, uneducated man who commits a series of brutal murders
without really knowing why and ends up being executed. It often is
credited with creating a sort of literary vanguard in the years
immediately following the bloody 1936-39 Civil War.
   ``The Hive'' takes place in the cold, depressing postwar years
and tells the story of starving writers who would sit for hours
during the winter in Madrid's literary cafes.
   Cela said he is working on a new project now, but he refused to
say what it is. ``You never really know how these things are going
to turn out until the end.''
   Cela was the first Spanish novelist to win the Nobel prize.
   In 1977, two years after the death of 36-year dictator Gen.
Francisco Franco, Vicente Aleixandre, an obscure poet from Spain's
pre-war literary generation, received the Nobel Prize for
literature. Fellow poet Juan Ramon Jimenez received the award in
1956.
   Spain's first literary Nobel laureate was playwright Jose
Echegaray, who won in 1904. Playwright Jacinto Benavente won the
award in 1922.
