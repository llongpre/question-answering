   Patrick White, a British-born writer
whose Nobel prize-winning fiction drew inspiration from life in
Australia's outback, has died, his literary agent said today. White
was 78.
   Barbara Mobbs, White's agent, said the author died Sunday of
respiratory failure after a lengthy illness.
   White, a rancher-turned-writer, frequently set his novels in the
outback. Considered one of this country's leading authors, his
works were required reading in many high schools and universities.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1973.
   The Sydney Morning Herald today eulogized White as the
``greatest Australian writer to date by far.''
   ``He transcended the cultural divisions from the past. He was
both contemporary and a traditionalist, an Australian and
simultaneously an international writer,'' the newspaper said.
   The poet, playwright and novelist was born on May 28, 1912, in
London. He was educated at King's College, Cambridge.
   He later worked as a ``jackaroo,'' or rancher, in New South
Wales state and then returned to England to study languages at
Cambridge.
   He served as an intelligence officer in the Royal Air Force in
the Middle East during World War II.
   ``Since the war, my life has been practically uneventful,''
White wrote for a 1955 reference work on authors. ``I returned to
Australia to a small property in Castle Hill, a town about 25 miles
from Sydney, where I breed schnauzers, saanen goats, cultivate
olives and citrus fruit, grow vegetables and live more or less off
my own produce.''
   His first novel, ``Happy Valley,'' published in 1939, was
awarded the Australian Literary Society Gold Medal. His 1955 novel,
``The Tree of Man,'' won the same prize.
   His novel, ``Eye of the Storm,'' portrayed the final days of an
elderly woman whose greedy relatives returned to Europe to await
her death. ``Eye of the Storm'' also explored Australians'
attitudes toward their European cultural roots.
   Essayist Margaret B. Lewis once wrote: ``White is a writer who
makes serious demands of his readers, straining prose to the utmost
poetic limits, putting severe pressure on syntax and vocabulary and
stretchin credence to an unusual degree in his search for the
transcendent in the lives of his idiosyncratic characters.''
   White's plays included the 1977 ``Big Toys'' about the
government's uranium mining policies, ``Signal Driver'' in 1982,
and ``Netherwood'' the following year. He also wrote a screenplay,
a book of verse and a 1981 autobiography, ``Flaws in the Glass: A
Self-Portrait.''
   Critics described his autobiography as a merciless
self-examination. It omitted his acts of generosity, such as his
support for Aboriginal education and his use of Nobel money to
establish an award for older Australian writers.
   In ``Flaws in the Glass,'' White wrote frankly of his
homosexuality, a subject he also had addressed in ``The Twyborn
Affair'' in 1979.
   There was no immediate word of survivors. A spokesman said
funeral arrangements were being kept private.
