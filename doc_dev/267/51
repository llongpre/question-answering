   Paz published his first collection of poems while still in his
teens. Today, in his 76th year, he remains active as a writer and a
critic.
   In ``A Draft of Shadows,'' from 1975, there is a line which
provides the key to much of Paz's production: ``Seeing the world is
spelling it.'' His poetry consists, in other words, to a very great
extent, of writing both with and about words. In Paz's
surrealistically inspired thought, the words are endowed in this
way with new, changeable, and richer meanings. The power of the
poetic vocation - often asserted by Brodsky, Walcott and others -
gives the words a form of otherwise unattainable content. ``We
never say/ the words of the poem/ The poem tells us'' (from
``Return,'' 1969). In a poem to Roman Jakobson in 1976, he
articulates his stance: ``Between what I see and what I say,/
between what I say and what I keep silent,/ between what I keep
silent and what I dream,/ between what I dream and what I forget:/
poetry.''
   Paz's poetry and essays evolve from an intractable but fruitful
union of cultures: pre-Columbian Indian, the Spanish conquistadors
and Western modernism. Experiences from India and other areas are
included as well. All of this has, in shifting configurations, been
reflected in his work. His own identity, Mexican and, in its
broader meaning, Latin American, has already been explored
decisively in ``The Labyrinth of Solitude'' (1950).
   The poet himself embodies this union of cultures - it is in his
blood. His mother's family was Spanish, from Andalusia. On his
father's side the Indian and the Spanish are combined.
   One of the high points of Paz's poetry is the long poem ``Sun
Stone'' (1957). This was inspired by a magnificent calendar stone,
which still stands as an heirloom from the Aztecs, whose calendar
was based on the conjunctions of Venus and the sun. The 584 days of
this cycle are matched by the 584 lines of the poem. This
suggestive work with its many layers of meaning seems to
incorporate, interpret and reconstrue major existential questions:
death, time, love, and reality.
   As a publisher of magazines, ``Vuelta'' (``Return'') being the
latest, Paz has been a lodestar in the tide of opinion. Others have
quite simply been obliged to state their position in relation to
his. He has pursued his humanistic course with unique integrity,
which is also recorded in the prize citation.
   In his book ``Sor Juana: or The Traps of Faith'' (1982) he
applies literary history and the history of ideas in depicting
Juana Ines de la Cruz, a remarkable 17th century woman. This
erudite poet and dramatist, a lady-in-waiting who later became a
nun, is the subject of a penetrating analysis against the
background of the culture and society of her day. The work takes
the form of a portrait, one which bears the signature of a great
humanist.
   Paz has written exquisite love poetry, at the same time sensuous
and visual. ``Woman:/ fountain in the night./ I am bound to her
quiet flowing.'' In his latest collection of poems, ``A Tree
Within'' (1987), we are confronted with a series of reflections on
death. Paz turns inwards on himself in a new way.
   Paz is a poet and essayist. His poetry, with one of its points
of departure in surrealism, which, however, he has developed and
broadened under the influence of pre-Columbian culture and the
Buddhist philosophy of India and Japan, can be found, apart from
his first volume from 1933, in the ``Poemas 1935-1975'' (1981) and
the bilingual ``Collected Poems 1957-1987'' (1987).
   His collections of essays, amounting to about 30, deal to a
great extent with social subjects. Not the least important of these
are, of course, Mexican history and culture, together with art and
literature, in particular the essence and diction of poetry.
