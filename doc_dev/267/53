<LEADPARA>  Novelist Selma Lagerlof, born on this date in 1858, was the first woman and
the first Swede to win the Nobel Prize for literature. She did this in 1909.
In 1940, the year in which she was to die, Lagerlof interceded through the
Swedish royal family to free her pen pal, Jewish poet Nelly Sachs, from a
German concentration camp. Viewed with the advantage of hindsight, her act,
done for humanitarian reasons, seems in addition to have been curiously
fortunate. Sachs, whose verse dealt with Jewish suffering at the hands of the
Nazis, later won her own Nobel Prize for literature. She shared the honor with
Shmuel Yosef Agnon in 1966.  </LEADPARA>
