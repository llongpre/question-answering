   Three American pioneers in financial
economics and corporate finance won the 1990 Nobel prize in
economics today.
   It was the seventh time in 10 years the award, given by the
Swedish Academy of Sciences, has gone to Americans.
   Harry Markowitz of the City University of New York was cited for
developing the theory of portfolio choice, the academy said.
   Merton Miller of the University of Chicago was honored for his
``fundamental contributions to the theory of corporate finance.''
   William Sharpe of Stanford University won for his contributions
to the theory of price formation for financial assets, the
so-called Capital Asset Pricing Model, the academy said.
   The three will divide the $700,000 prize.
   Since 1969, when the prize was first awarded, 18 of the 30
winners of the economics prize have been Americans.
   The announcement of the prize was delayed for more than 45
minutes, while the academy tried unsuccessfully to reach Markowitz,
who was in Japan.
   Miller and Sharpe, the laureates the academy reached by
telephone, were ``really stunned,'' said Professor Assar Lindbeck
of the Swedish Academy of Sciences.
   He said they asked about the exchange rate between the dollar
and the kronor.
   ``We wanted to give the prize for pioneer work, innovators,''
said Lindbeck. He said financial markets has been one of the
hottest areas for economic research in the past 10 years.
   Most of the prizewinners' work was done in the 1950s and 1960s.
Their theories began to be used in the early 1970s, he said.
   ``Each of them (the winners) gave one building block'' to the
financial market theory, Lindbeck said. ``The theory would have
been incomplete if one of them had been missing. Together they
created a complete picture of theory for the financial market which
has had great importance in research and education.''
   Most previous prizes have been awarded for broader areas of
research, Lindbeck said. The working of financial markets is a
specialized field.
   ``Financial markets serve a key purpose in a modern market
economy by allocating productive resources among various areas of
production,'' the academy said.
   To a large extent, it is through financial markets that savings
in different sectors of the economy are transferred to firms for
investments in buildings and machines, the academy said.
   It also said, ``Financial markets reflect firms' expected
prospects and risks, which implies that risks can be spread and
that savers and investors can acquire valuable information for
their investment decisions.''
   Markowitz, 63, a native of Chicago, made ``the first pioneering
contribution in the field of financial economics'' in the 1950s,
the academy said.
   He developed a theory for households' and companys' allocation
of financial assets under uncertainty, the so-called theory of
portfolio choice.
   The theory analyzes how wealth can best be invested in assets
that differ in their expected return and risk. It therefore helps
reduce risk.
   Miller, 67, a native of Boston, made the most important
achievements in the theory of corporate finance and the evaluation
of companys on markets, said the academy.
   Miller initially collaborated with 1985 economics prize-winner
Franco Modigliani of the United States.
   The theory explains the relation, or lack of relation, between
companys' capital asset structure and dividend policy on one hand,
and their market value on the other.
   ``I'm delighted to accept it, and I'm still in a state of
shock,'' Miller said in a radio interview this morning.
   ``Our work was always known as the Modigliani-Miller
propositions of corporate finance,'' he said. ``He then won it for
his contributions with me but also for his other work in economics.
   ``They've already recognized the work once and now I'm getting
the other half,'' he said.
   Sharpe, 56, a native of Cambridge, Mass., was the leading figure
among several researchers in the 1960s who used Markowitz's
portfolio theory as a basis for developing a theory of price
formation for financial assets, the academy said. That was the
so-called Capital Asset Pricing Model.
   The economics prize is the only Nobel award established to
complement the five prizes that dynamite-inventor Alfred Nobel
created in his will at the end of last century. It was instituted
in 1968 by Sweden's Central Bank.
   Nobel's original prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, peace
and literature have been awarded since 1901.
   The economics prize is awarded by the same body that awards
Nobel's physics and chemistry prizes. It follows the same
guidelines, including Nobel's wish that the prize shall be awarded
to those who have ``conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.''
   The Nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced
Wednesday.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was awarded the peace
prize on Monday.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death in 1896. The peace prize is given in Oslo, and the others in
Stockholm.
