   Top achievers in pressing environmental
causes soon will have their own version of the Nobel Prizes, a
descendant of the Swedish inventor of dynamite said.
   Claes Nobel, a Swedish-born resident of Milwaukee and a
great-grand nephew of the founder of the Nobel Prizes, unveiled
plans Monday to create Earth Prizes for environmental
accomplishments.
   Nobel said the Earth Prizes will be in the ``same tradition and
in the same spirit'' as the Nobel Prizes established by Alfred
Nobel. The environmental awards will not be affiliated with the
Nobel Prizes, he said.
   ``Let us all be inspired by the fact that each of us may bring
about a small change, and that all of us together can make an
enormous difference,'' Nobel said.
   He said seven Earth Prizes will be awarded annually in each of
two levels, one for grass roots activists, the other for heads of
state, world leaders, corporations and organizations.
   The seven categories are conservation, food, energy, pollution
abatement, population, disarmament and Earth ethics. Nobel, whose
foundation, United Earth, will name the winners, said the prizes
will include cash awards of undetermined amounts.
   Seed money will come from organizers of New World's Eve, an
international television telethon planned for Dec. 31.
   Bill Marshall, organizer of New World's Eve in Los Angeles, said
plans for an annual telethon for the next 10 years involving his
group and United Earth will be completed this week.
   The initial grassroots awards will be presented during the
telethon and financed by John LaBatt's Ltd. of Canada, Marshall
said.
   Nobel was invited to Douglasville by resident Leslie Schulten,
founder and president of Project Peace Tree, an organization that
works to improve East-West relations.
   Alfred Nobel invented dynamite in 1866 and endowed prizes for
science, literature and peace. The prizes are announced every
October in Stockholm.
   The Swedish Academy of Sciences has established prizes for
sciences not endowed by Nobel, including one for ecology.
   A 1987 genealogy of the Nobel family lists Claes Nobel as an
executive at Eweson Digester Corp., Alternatives Combustion
Engineering Inc. and the Earth Aid Society.
