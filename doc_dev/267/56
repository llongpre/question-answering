   Two researchers from the United States
and one from Britain won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday for
helping develop drugs to fight AIDS, herpes, leukemia, malaria,
heart disease and stomach ulcers.
   The award capped more than four decades of pioneering work for
Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings, who began collaborating
in 1945. They work at Wellcome Research Laboratories in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.
   They share the $390,000 prize with Sir James W. Black of King's
College Hospital Medical School in London. His research led to a
beta blocker drug for heart disease and a drug for peptic ulcers.
   ``I wished I had my beta blockers handy,'' Black, 64, quipped at
a news conference at King's College after he learned he won.
   Dr. Gosta Garton, a member of the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska
Institute, which awards the prize, said the three winners were
``well-chosen.''
   ``You can see the direct working effects'' of their research,
said Garton. ``The entire research world knows that they have been
in the picture for years.''
   The Nobel Assembly credited Elion, 70, and Hitchings, 83, with
helping develop six different drugs that can be used for at least
nine serious conditions.
   They included 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine for leukemia;
azathioprine for organ transplant rejection and autoimmune
diseases; allopurinol for gout; acyclovir for herpes virus
infections, pyrimethamine for malaria; and trimethoprim for
bacterial infections and pulmonary infections brought on by AIDS.
   The assembly said their ideas also paved the way for development
of azidothymidine, or AZT, which is the best documented drug so far
in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   AIDS, usually transmitted through sexual contact, infected
needles or blood transfusions, renders the immune system unable to
resist disease. AZT is the only federally approved drug for
treating AIDS in the United States.
   ``I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,''
Hitchings said from his office at Wellcome. ``I've had a lot of
honors, but the most important honors for me have been meeting
patients whose lives have been saved or whose children's lives have
been saved by drugs I've invented.''
   Elion said from her home in Chapel Hill, N.C, that she couldn't
believe she won and didn't even know she was nominated.
   Asked about her greatest achievement, she said: ``You can't
discriminate among your `children.' Each one in its own time was
the most exciting.''
   Elion and Hitchings broke new ground in finding the difference
in the processing of genetic material between normal cells and
cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and viruses, the Nobel Assembly
said.
   Knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack
disease-causing organisms by interfering with their replication
without harming healthy ones, the assembly said.
   Black helped develop propranolol, a beta blocker used to treat
heart disease and high blood pressure.
   Beta blockers block the stimulating effect of adrenaline on the
heart, reducing the rate and the force at which the heart pumps
blood through the body _ and reducing high blood pressure.
   ``Previously used drugs acted by increasing the oxygen transport
to the heart. In contrast, Black's idea was to decrease the oxygen
demand of the heart,'' the announcement said. Specialists said
Black also contributed to treatments for stroke and high blood
pressure.
   Physiologist Bengt Pernow, another member of the Nobel Assembly,
said Black made ``the greatest breakthrough when it comes to
pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of
digitalis 200 years ago.''
   In 1972, Black developed another medication, cimetidine, which
introduced a new principle in the treatment of peptic ulcer.
   ``Black in the laboratory has relieved more human suffering than
thousands of doctors in a lifetime at the bedside,'' said Desmond
Laurence, head of pharmacology at University College in London.
   Black said scientists are under too much pressure to produce
immediate practical results. ``I think there needs to be much more
money for scientists to do experiments they are almost ashamed of
because they're so untested,'' he said.
   Black was born in Scotland and earned degrees in surgery and
medicine at the University of St. Andrews.
   Elion has worked at Wellcome Research Laboratories since 1944
and as a senior research chemist since 1950. Since 1983, she has
been a scientist emeritus at the laboratory, which is the research
arm of the Burroughs Wellcome Co. pharmaceutical firm.
   Elion has been a research professor of pharmacology at Duke
University since 1983. She earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter
College in 1937 and a master's degree from New York University in
1941.
   Hitchings received a bachelor's degree from the University of
Washington in 1927 and a doctorate from Harvard University in 1933.
   After teaching at Harvard and Western Reserve University, he
joined Burroughs Wellcome in 1942. He became its research director
in 1955 and was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984.
   No U.S. researcher won the medicine prize until 1933. But the
United States has dominated in the past 20 years, with Elion and
Hitchings becoming the 31st and 32nd Americans to win. During that
time, there have been 20 laureates from other countries.
   Last year's medicine winner was Susumu Tonegawa of Japan for his
study of the body's immune system at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   The Nobels were first awarded in 1901 as a stipulation in the
will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist who made a fortune
on his invention of dynamite.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize, announced
Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway. Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz last
week becamethe first Arabic-language literature laureate.
   The economics prize is to be announced Tuesday and chemistry and
physics on Wednesday.
