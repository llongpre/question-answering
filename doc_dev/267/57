   The English publishing rights to 14 books by
Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian writer who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in
literature, have been acquired by Doubleday, the publishing house
said.
   It also said that Doubleday U.K., a division of Transworld
Publishers Ltd. London, has acquired the English publishing rights
to a book on architecture by Britain's heir to the throne, Prince
Charles.
   Jacqueline Onassis, a Doubleday editor, and Alberto Vitale,
president and chief executive officer of the Bantam Doubleday Dell
Publishing Group, who lived in Egypt for many years, acquired the
rights to Mahfouz's works from The American University in Cairo
Press, according to a news release.
   It was not immediately known how much Doubleday paid to acquire
the English rights to the works by Mahfouz and Prince Charles. The
publishing house could not be reached late Monday for comment.
   Nancy Evans, president and publisher of Doubleday, said in a
release last week that the company will publish 14 books by Mahfouz,
the first writer in the Arabic language to win the Nobel Prize in
literature.
   Mahfouz, 77, has written more than 30 novels and 12 volumes of
short stories. Doubleday will publish a collection of his short
stories and 13 of his novels, four of which have never been
published in English.
   Doubleday will publish three works by Mahfouz in fall 1989. In
1990, it will publish in hardcover the first volume of his
masterwork, ``The Cairo Trilogy,'' which was published in Arabic in
1957. The book depicts urban life in Egypt.
   The Press, which first published Mahfouz in English in 1978, is
the author's exclusive representative and will continue to publish
his books in English in Egypt.
   Prince Charles' book, ``A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of
Architecture,'' is based on his recent television documentary, which
sharply criticized modern architecture in Britain.
   It is to be published in Britain in March 1989, said Paul Sherer,
managing director of Transworld Publishers. Doubleday will publish
the book in the United States and Canada in fall 1989, said Evans.
