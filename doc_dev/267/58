   The five members of the Nobel prize
committee met behind locked doors Wednesday to choose the winner of
the 1988 peace prize.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev were
mentioned as leading contenders for the prestigious award.
   The committee's regulations bar it from divulging names, but the
Oslo daily VG speculated the superpower leaders would share the
honor for signing a treaty to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear
weapons and putting arms control efforts on a new course.
   Committee Chairman Egil Aarvik was to announce the decision at 2
p.m. (9 a.m. EDT) Thursday.
   The committee made its selection from an initial list of 97
candidates at a two-hour session at the Nobel Institute, a
two-story building in the shadow of the royal palace in downtown
Oslo.
   The list included 74 individuals and 23 organizations.
   Wednesday's session was the group's first formal meeting since
mid-August, but Nobel officials indicated that a consensus emerged
even before the final session.
   The prize carries a cash award of $390,000.
   Aarvik quashed speculation about U.N. Secretary General Javiar
Perez de Cuellar. He said the U.N. chief was not nominated before
the Feb. 1 deadline for this year's prize.
   Among other candidates reportedly on the list were the World
Health Organization, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, U.N.
mediator Diego Cordovez, Anglican church envoy to Lebanon Terry
Waite, the Greenpeace environmentalist group, jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, and Norwegian Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who chaired a U.N. environmental
commission.
   Helge Pharo, a consultant for the committee, said the list of
candidates was whittled down to about six by the summer and was
further narrowed at the last meeting in August.
   Pharo told The Associated Press he and a second consultant
prepared reports and profiles of the candidates that sometimes ran
up to 20 pages long.
   The decision is by consensus, and the committee members do not
vote, he said.
   Last year's peace laureate was President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica for his Central American peace plan.
   The peace prize is the first to be announced of five awards
founded by the estate of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite who
died in 1896. A sixth prize in economics was added in 1968 and
funded by the Bank of Sweden.
   The prizes for medicine, physics and chemistry will be announced
in mid-October in Stockholm. No date has been set for the
literature prize announcement, also in the Swedish capital.
   Nobel's testament dictated that the peace prize be awarded by a
committee elected by the Norwegian Parliament, but his reasoning
remains a mystery. Norway and Sweden were under one monarchy until
1905.
   The will said the prize should go to the person who has worked
most ``for fraternity between peoples, for the abolition or
reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of
peace congresses.''
   But the committee has expanded the definition to encompass human
rights activists such as U.S. author Elie Wiesel in 1986, Polish
union leader Lech Walesa in 1983, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov
in 1975 and U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King in 1964.
   In addition to Aarvik, a retired journalist and former Cabinet
minister, the committee members are history professor Francis
Sejersted; former Prime Minister Odvar Nordli; Gunnar J. Staalsett,
a priest and head of the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation;
and author Gidske Anderson.
   Members are elected to six-year terms.
