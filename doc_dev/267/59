   The foundation that finances the Nobel
prizes on Monday rejected a proposal from 30 laureates to create a
Nobel environmental prize.
   The laureates, including Peace Prize winners Willy Brandt of
West Germany and Adolfo Perez Esquivel of Argentina, suggested the
prize be awarded in the Netherlands by a committee of the Dutch
Parliament.
   ``We fear an inflation of prizes would seriously diminish the
value of those already existing,'' said Stig Ramel, chairman of the
Nobel Foundation.
   The first Nobel prizes were awarded in 1901 from a trust
bequeathed by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite. He
established prizes in medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and
peace.
   A sixth prize in economic sciences was established in 1968,
funded by the Bank of Sweden, and was called a Nobel memorial prize
to distinguish it from the others.
   This year each prize is worth $650,000.
   Ramel said there will be no more prizes. The foundation has
exclusive rights to the Nobel name and will not allow it to be
linked to another prize, he said.
