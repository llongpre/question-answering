   The 18 members of the Swedish Academy
made their final deliberations for Thursday's 1988 Nobel literature
prize announcement under pressure to fill some gaps in the award's
87-year history.
   No writer from China has ever won the prestigous prize, despite
that country's 3,000-year literary tradition. The laureate list,
which dates back to 1901, contains just two Asians. Only six women
have ever been honored.
   In keeping with tradition, the academy's secretary, Sture Allen,
announces the winner when a gold clock in the academy's 18th
century office strikes 1 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT).
   The other Nobel prizes are to be announced next week by the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Karolinska Institute.
They include the awards for chemistry, physics, economics and
medicine.
   The peace prize, announced in Oslo, Norway, on Sept. 29, went to
the U.N. peacekeeping forces around the world. This year's prizes
are worth $390,000 each.
   The last woman to win the literature prize was Sweden's Nelly
Sachs, who shared it with a man, S.J. Agnon of Israel, in 1966.
Despite Sweden's ingrained system of sexual equality, men outnumber
women on the academy by 16-2. All members serve for life.
   The last Asian winner was Yasunari Kawabata of Japan in 1968.
From there, the gap stretches back to 1913 and Indian laureate
Rabindranath Tagore.
   ``I would say it is time for a Chinese author,'' said Asa
Beckman, an editor at BLM, one of Sweden's leading literary
magazines. She suggested Bad Jin or female novelist Shen Rong.
   Academy members keep a strict code of secrecy. They never
discuss candidates by name. However, member Goran Malmqvist of
Stockholm University hinted in an interview that this year's choice
should satisfy most people.
   ``I find it hard to imagine any nasty comments,'' he said.
   ``This year we have a short list with extraordinarily worthy
candidates,'' said Malmqvist. ``They all have contributed to world
literature.''
   The academy has been studying the list of less than 10
candidates since before the summer, he said.
   Culture page editors of Sweden's biggest newspapers and
publishing houses admitted they were at loss for a good guess this
year.
   But speculation centered on a handful of favorites, including
Nadine Gordimer of South Africa, and Mexican writers Octavio Paz or
Carlos Fuentes.
   Others mentioned by perennial Nobel watchers included U.S.
author Joyce Carol Oates, Trinidad-born Indian writer V.S. Naipaul,
Japanese authors Yasushi Inove and Kobo Abe, Italy's Alberto
Moravia and Jaan Kross, an Estonian who spent eight years in a
Soviet labor camp in Siberia.
   Then there is Graham Greene. The British writer has been
discussed since the 1960s and has become known as ``the man who did
not get the Nobel prize.''
   According to many accounts, Greene has been blocked by academy
member Artur Lundqvist, who objects that his novels do not raise
literary standards. However, Lundqvist's influence in the academy
is said to have declined since he suffered a serious illness in
1981.
   The Swedish national news agency TT suggested East German author
Christa Wolff, France's Marguerite Duras, Britain's Doris Lessing
and Ana Matute of Spain among the possible female winners.
   ``Will (Allen) once again have to hear the eternal question: Why
don't you ever choose a woman?'' TT said.
   The election of Malmqvist, a Chinese specialist, to the academy
in 1985 reflected an awareness of criticism for having a decidedly
pro-European or Western slant.
   The following year the prize went for the first time to an
African, Nigeria's Wole Soyinka.
   Alfred Nobel, who made his fortune from inventing dynamite and
other explosives, stipulated in his will that the prize be awarded
to the author who produced ``the most outstanding work of an ideal
tendency.'' Nobel died in 1896.
   His words have been interpreted differently by the generations
of academies. In the first decades after World War II the prize was
awarded to modernists, such as the poet T.S. Eliot, and to
established writers such as Bertrand Russel.
   In the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, the prize was used
to draw attention to masters who wrote for a limited audience and
were unknown worldwide, such as Czech poet Jaroslav Seifert in 1984
and Greek writer Odysseus Elytis, the 1981 laureate.
   The laureates will be given their awards in Stockholm Dec. 10.
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is to accept the
peace prize in Oslo on the same day, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.
