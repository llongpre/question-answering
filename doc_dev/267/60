   American researchers Gertrude Elion and
George H. Hitchings won the 1988 Nobel Prize in medicine today for
discoveries leading to drugs that treat AIDS and herpes.
   Sir James W. Black of Great Britain shared the award for
research that led to a beta blocker drug for heart disease and a
drug for peptic ulcers. Black quipped today that the prize came as
such a shock that ``I wished I had my beta blockers handy.''
   The Americans' research also led to the development of drugs for
the treatment of leukemia, malaria, and to fight the rejection of
transplanted organs, said the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska
Institute.
   Elion, 70, a New York City native, and Hitchings, 83, born in
Hoquiam, Wash., are affiliated with Wellcome Research Laboratories
in Research Triangle Park, N.C. Black, 64, born in Scotland, works
at King's College Hospital Medical School at the University of
London.
   ``I'm pleased more for my descendants than I am for myself,''
Hitchings said in a telephone interview from his office. ``I've had
a lot of honors, but the most important honors for me have been
meeting patients whose lives have been saved or whose children's
lives have been saved by drugs I've invented.''
   Elion said from her home in Chapel Hill, N.C.: ``Surprised is
not exactly the word. ``Disbelieving is the right word. ... I
didn't even know I had been nominated.''
   The work of Elion and Hitchings broke new ground in finding the
difference in the processing of genetic material between normal
cells and cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and viruses, the
Karolinska Institute said.
   Knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack
disease-causing organisms by interfering with their replication,
the announcement said.
   The institute said that among the drugs developed from their
ideas is azidothymidine, or AZT, which has had the best documented
results in the treatment of AIDS, the institute said. AZT is the
only federally approved drug for treating acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in the United States.
   ``We are still harvesting the fruits of what they determined
almost 40 years ago,'' said Folke Sjoqvist, a member of the Nobel
Assembly.
   Their discoveries in the late 1940s led to a variety of drugs,
like 6-mercaptopurine in 1951 for leukemia. They also developed
azathioprine, which was for many years the only drug available to
prevent the rejection of transplanted organs.
   Another breakthrough in applying their research came in 1977,
when the first effective drug was developed for treating herpes
virus infections. The drug, acyclovir, does not cure genital
herpes, but it makes outbreaks of sores less severe and makes them
heal faster.
   In 1964, Black developed the first clinically useful beta
blocker drug, propranolol, for use in the treatment of heart
disease.
   Propranolol acts on beta receptors on nerves leading to the
heart and blocks the stimulating effect of adrenaline. Receptors
are specific places to which drugs and natural substances attach
themselves to produce their effects.
   Physiologist Bengt Pernow, another member of the Nobel Assembly,
said Black made ``the greatest breakthrough when it comes to
pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of
digitalis 200 years ago.''
   In 1972, Black discovered a group of histamine receptors, a
finding that led to the development of the drug cimetidine for
peptic ulcer.
   The three winners will share a cash award of 2.5 million kronor,
or about $390,000, which they will receive at an awards ceremony
Dec. 10.
   The prize was approved by a majority vote of the institute's
50-member Nobel Assembly on the recommendation of a five-member
committee which studied hundreds of research briefs.
   Hitchings received a bachelor's degree from the University of
Washington in 1927 and a doctorate from Harvard University in 1933.
   After teaching at Harvard and Western Reserve University, he
joined Burroughs Wellcome Co., a pharmaceutical firm, in 1942.
Wellcome Research Laboratories is the company's research arm.
   Hitchings became Burroughs Wellcome's research director in 1955.
He was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984 and has been a
professor at Duke University and Brown University.
   Elion earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter College and a
master's degree from New York University.
   She has worked at Wellcome Research Labs since 1944 and as a
senior research chemist since 1950. Since 1983, she has been a
scientist emeritus at the laboratory and a research professor of
pharmacology at Duke.
   Black received bachelor of surgery and bachelor of medicine
degrees from University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
   The medicine prize is the first of four Nobel prizes to be
announced this week. On Tuesday, the laureate in economic sciences
will be named, and prizes in physics and chemistry will be awarded
Wednesday.
   The Nobels were first awarded in 1901, five years after the
death of Alfred Nobel, who made a fortune on his invention of
dynamite.
   No U.S. researcher won the medicine prize until 1933. In the
last 20 years there have been 30 U.S. laureates and 19 from all
other countries.
   Last year's winner was Susumu Tonegawa of Japan, who conducted
his study of the body's immune system at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   The Nobel Peace prize went this year to the U.N. peacekeeping
forces. The literature prize was won by Egyptian Naguib Mahfouz,
the first Arabic-language laureate in the 87-year history of the
Nobels.
