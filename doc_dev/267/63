<TEXT>
   Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel
Prize for Literature, said Thursday he is not well enough to travel
to Stockholm in December to receive his $390,000 award.
   Mahfouz, who said his doctors advised him not to go, added that
it had not been decided whether anyone from his family would attend
the Dec. 10 ceremony.
   Egypt's ambassador to Stockholm, Abdel-Rahman Ahmed Marei, will
accept the prize in his name, he said in a telephone interview.
   Mahfouz, who will be 77 on Dec. 11, is writing the Nobel Lecture
for the ambassador to read, the Middle East News Agency said. It
traditionally is delivered the day after the ceremony.
   Mahfouz ranks among Egypt's most popular writers. His works cover
historical, social and, in his recent books and short stories,
metaphysical themes. Many of his works have been translated into
English, French, German and Swedish among other languages.
