<HEAD>Peruvian Writer Praises Nobel Prize Winner Octavio Paz</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa,
whose novel ``Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter'' has just become a
Hollywood movie, says he's proud the Nobel Prize for Literature
went to Mexican poet Octavio Paz.
   ``I think Octavio Paz is a great poet, one of the greatest
intellectuals of our time,'' Vargas Llosa said in an interview with
local television. ``So it made me very proud as a Latin American
that the prize went to Octavio Paz.''
   Vargas Llosa, 54, was visiting Puerto Rico for the CinemaFest
film festival which opened Thursday night with the movie ``Tune in
Tomorrow'' based on his ``Aunt Julia.''
   Vargas Llosa made an unsuccesful bid for the presidency of Peru
in June, losing in an upset to maverick candidate Alberto Fujimori.
Vargas Llosa said Thursday he had no further political plans and
would dedicate his life to literature.
   Vargas Llosa said he loved ``Tune in Tomorrow,'' starring Peter
Falk and Barbara Hershey, although the film adaptation did not
follow to the letter his novel about a young man who falls in love
with an older woman, the sister of his uncle's wife.
   ``Movies are another medium of expression,'' he said. ``The
novel is the written word and films are images.''
   Another Vargas Llosa novel dealing with an affair between a
young man and a relative, the erotic ``In Praise of the
Stepmother,'' was published in English this fall.
