   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today ordered the restoration
of citizenship to a large number of exiles, and an official
suggested that Nobel laureates Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Joseph
Brodsky may be among them.
   The Soviet president ``canceled the decrees on citizenship
concerning a number of persons who are now living abroad,'' the
official Soviet news agency Tass reported, citing an official
announcement.
   The decree came two days after Gorbachev issued a sweeping
decree restoring the rights of all victims of Stalin's repressions,
saying thousands of innocent people still bore ``a stain of
injustice.''
   The brief report on today's order said it dealt with
``injustices that occurred between 1966 and 1988,'' but did not say
if it affected everyone whose citizenship was revoked during that
period. Nor did it name anyone in particular.
   However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said the
order ``concerns a rather large number of people. Some names were
mentioned _ Brodsky, Solzhenitsyn.''
   ``I just heard that ostensibly Mr. Solzhenitsyn got back his
Soviet citizenship, but I don't know for sure,'' Gremitskikh said.
   The government of former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev revoked
the citizenship of prominent authors and performing artists who
spoke out against repression in their homeland.
   But Gorbachev's government has restored the citizenship of a
number of them, notably cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich
and his wife, singer Galina Vishnevskaya.
   Gremitskikh was unable to say whether the presidential order
also applies to Jews who emigrated to Israel and were deprived of
their citizenship.
   Both Solzhenitsyn and Brodsky spent time in Soviet prison camps
for their political views.
   Solzhenitsyn is the author of ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' which
depicted the horrors of dictator Josef Stalin's prison camps. The
author was charged with high treason in 1974, stripped of his
citizenship and expelled from the country. He now lives in Vermont.
   Other well-known works by Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize
in literature in 1970, include ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich'' and ``Cancer Ward.'' The Soviet Union banned his books
for decades but in the past year has published several of them,
including ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
   Solzhenitsyn came under particular criticism in his homeland
because he has condemned not only Stalin but also Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin, calling him ``evil.'' Lenin is still generally
revered in the Soviet Union.
   Solzhenitsyn has said he would not return to the Soviet Union
unless all of his books were published and widely available. A
number of his books have been printed, but almost none can readily
be found in the shortage-plagued Soviet Union.
   Brodsky is a poet and essayist who now lives in New York. Only a
few of his works were published in the Soviet Union until the
literary monthly Novy Mir printed a selection after he won the 1987
Nobel Prize for Literature.
   He was sentenced to five years in an Arctic labor camp in 1964
after being convicted of ``parasitism,'' but released after 18
months. Parasitism was the crime of not holding a job. Many
dissidents were fired, barred from working and then found guilty of
parasitism.
   Brodsky left the Soviet Union in 1972 after being told by secret
police to emigrate or ``face the consequences.'' He understood the
threat to mean that he might face another prison term if he stayed.
   He left behind an eloquent appeal to Brezhnev that he be
permitted to return home one day.
   ``Although I am losing my Soviet citizenship, I do not cease to
be a Russian poet. I belong to Russian culture, I feel part of
it,'' he said.
   ``I feel bitter as I leave Russia, I was born, raised and have
lived here and I owe everything I have in the world to Russia.
Everything bad I have suffered has been more than compensated by
the good, and I have never felt that I have been hurt by my
homeland.''
   In an interview in Paris with the reporters from the Soviet
newspaper Izvestia in 1988, Brodsky said he might be interested in
returning to Leningrad for a private visit.
   Moscow News said today that a book of Brodsky's poetry is being
published for the first time in the Soviet Union. The Northwest
publishing house in Leningrad plans 100,000 copies of the book,
``The Autumn Cry of the Hawk.''
