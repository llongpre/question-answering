   Trygve Haavelmo of Norway won the Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Science today for showing that
mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the puzzling
shifts in the economy.
   Haavelmo's work in 1941 pioneered the field of econometrics,
which introduced statistical probability to economic forecasting,
the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
   Colleagues said the 77-year-old Haavelmo has shunned publicity
in the past and disdained awards. He was unreachable at his home in
the Oslo suburb of Baerum for about five hours after the Nobel was
announced.
   He later told the national NRK television that he was
``flustered'' and declined to be interviewed. But said he may issue
a written statement later.
   ``I'm grateful for all the attention, but I'm a little
perplexed, so I can't be very much help to you,'' he said.
   Haavelmo, a professor of economics at Oslo University, was the
second Norwegian to win the economics prize. He was a research
assistant to Ragnar Frisch, who won the prize in 1969, the first
year it was awarded.
   The prize is worth about $469,000.
   Econometrics holds that economic theories can be proven by
testing them with mathematical and statistical models.
   Assar Lindbeck, chairman of the prize committee, called Haavelmo
``the father of modern econometrics'' and a dominant figure in
post-war economic theories.
   ``Through his new economic theory, scientists have learned to
anticipate how governmental institutions react and how they
influence people's decisions,'' Lindbeck said when announcing the
prize.
   Meghnad Desai, a professor at the London School of Economics,
said: ``I'm very happy he got the prize ... There has been a
tendency to give prizes to people who benefited from his work and
he has been in danger of being ignored.''
   Haavelmo's 1941 doctoral thesis, which he presented at Harvard
University, ``had a swift and pathbreaking influence on the
development of econometrics,'' the academy said in a summary of his
achievements.
   His theories ``gave rise to extraordinarily rapid methodological
development'' and established ``the foundation of modern
econometric methods,'' the statement said.
   Haavelmo went to the United States on a Rockefeller grant in
1939, was a professor at the University of Chicago and worked for
the Norwegian Trade Commission.
   He returned to Norway in 1947 and has been at Oslo University
since 1948.
   Haavelmo, the son of a school administrator, is a member of the
American Economic Association and the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences. He was born Dec. 13, 1911, in the Norwegian town of
Skedsmo.
   The academy said Haavelmo's theories overcame the problems
economists faced because they were unable to test their ideas in
the same ways as scientists who work in laboratories.
   Economists also could not weed out the influence of millions of
individual decisions that people and companies make that disturb
the models theorists devised.
   Haavelmo overcame these difficulties by introducing the idea of
statistical probability.
   ``He also showed that misleading interpretations of individual
relations due to interdependence cannot be avoided unless all
relations in a theoretical model are estimated simultaneously,''
the academy said.
   In such areas as investment theories and economic development,
``Haavelmo's approach has resulted in influential and far-reaching
contributions,'' the academy said.
   The approach also has helped in the analysis of macroeconomic
fluctuations, fiscal policies, and price theory,'' it said.
   Last year's Nobel Laureate was Maurice Allais of France, who won
the prize for his theories of how price systems can work to keep
economies in balance. He was the first French economist to join the
list of economic laureates.
   Americans have dominated the 19-year history of the prize,
taking 15 of the 26 awards since it was created by the Bank of
Sweden. Five winners were British.
   The economics prize is a late addition to the five awards
established in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed his
fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific
breakthroughs, activities for peace, and literature ``of an
idealistic tendency.''
