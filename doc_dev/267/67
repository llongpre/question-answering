   The Norwegian Nobel Institute and the
country's news media are in the throes of a guessing game with
traditions as strong as the Peace Prize itself.
   The ritual is simple: Norway's press tries to guess the name of
the annual Nobel laureate. And the institute says nothing, even
though the decision was probably made several months ago.
   ``We never say who the winner is before the official
announcement,'' said institute director Geir Lundestad. There are
100 nominations, including 26 organizations, for the 71st Peace
Prize, he said. The winner will be announced Oct. 15 in Oslo.
   The other Nobel prizes will be announced in Stockholm, starting
with medicine on Oct. 8. The economics prize, established in 1968
and funded by the Bank of Sweden, will be announced Oct. 16.
   Physics and chemistry prizes, funded by income from the will of
dynamite-inventor Alfred Bernard Nobel, will be announced Oct. 17.
The date for the literature prize has not been announced.
   This year's prizes are worth $695,000.
   ``There is an opportunity for one more meeting, but most of the
pieces have fallen into place,'' Lundestad said when asked if a
1990 Peace Prize winner had been selected.
   The media has picked four hot names: Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, African National Congress Deputy President Nelson
Mandela, Chinese pro-democracy student leader Chai Ling and
Czechoslovak President Vaclev Havel.
   Their brash predictions are sometimes off by a continent or two.
Late last year, newspapers were betting on Eastern Europe's
democratic reform leaders when the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual
leader of Tibet, had probably already been selected.
   Other recent winners were Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's
Solidarity Union, South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
Mother Teresa and the United Nations Peace keeping Forces.
   Lundestad said the great secrecy about the coveted prize, first
awarded in 1901, protects some candidates from reprisals or keeps
their activities confidential.
   Names of candidates are never released. No notes leave the room
after deliberations by the five-member Nobel Peace Prize Committee,
appointed by Norway's parliament for six-year terms.
   But nominations are often announced by those forwarding a
candidate.
   ``There are thousands of people and organizations with the right
to nominate, including former laureates, elected officials, even
some university professors and organizations,'' said Lundestad, who
is not a voting member of the committee.
   The picture becomes more clouded by scores of nominations from
groups who have no right to make them. Norway's largest labor
union, for example, announced its enthusiastic but invalid
nomination of Gorbachev.
   ``In that particular case, the name was also forwarded in
several other valid nominations,'' Lundestad said. He confirmed the
nomination because several groups have announced it.
   The five-employee institute sifts through thousands of letters a
year, hunting for valid nominations that arrived before the Feb. 1
deadline.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year pushed for the award in a
secret campaign that appears to have started after a winner had
already been selected.
   ``It doesn't do any good anyway,'' Lundestad said about such
campaigns.
   The fiercely independent committee, aided by institute
researchers, searches for a person or group fulfilling criteria set
in Nobel's will.
   There have been 19 years in which no prize was awarded.
