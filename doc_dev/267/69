   The government newspaper Izvestia Sunday published
an article on Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky, placing the poet who
was once convicted as a parasite on society among this century's
greatest Soviet writers.
   Two Izvestia correspondents spoke briefly with the poet this fall
in Paris and attended seminars he had addressed.
   Brodsky, who left the Soviet Union in 1972 for New York, had only
a few of his poems published in the Soviet Union until the literary
monthly Novy Mir (New World) printed some of his works after he won
the 1987 Nobel Prize for Literature.
   Izvestia said Brodsky belonged among other Soviet writers who
have won the Nobel Prize, including Ivan Bunin, Boris Pasternak,
Mikhail Sholokov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn _ all of whom either
left the Soviet Union or were persecuted for their writings.
   In the early 1960s, a court convicted Brodsky of parasitism _
since writing poetry was not considered an official job _ and
sentenced him to hard labor.
   ``Along with the rightful feeling of patriotic pride and joy,
there is sadness,'' the article said, referring to a comment by a
Leningrad newspaper before Brodsky's exile that said there was ``no
place in Leningrad'' for him.
   The Izvestia article quoted Brodsky as saying he can't imagine
returning to Leningrad as a tourist, and would only be interested in
returning to see two or three close friends. But he was quoted as
saying he doubted he would go back.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness, the Soviet Union has published works previously
banned for political reasons.
   Artists such as director Yuri Lyubimov, who left the country
because of government restrictions on their work, are returning to
stage new productions or to perform.
