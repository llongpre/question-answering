   The winner of the 1989 Nobel Prize for
literature will be announced on Thursday, the awarding body said
today.
   The Swedish Academy, a 203-year-old institution created to
safeguard the Swedish language and literature, will announce the
winner from its 18th-century headquarters in Stockholm's Old Town.
   Irish poet Seamus Heaney has been the only candidate tipped by
the Swedish media _ by the weekly ``Vi'' magazine. There was also
speculation the prize might go to an East European writer.
   The Academy never discloses a list of nominees. According to
tradition, it keeps the date of the Nobel announcement secret until
a few days before.
   The literature prize is the last of six Nobel prizes to be
awarded this year. The prize is worth about $463,000.
   The 1988 laureate was Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the
first Arabic-language author to receive the prize since it was
first awarded in 1901.
   The award comes as the 18-member Academy has been distracted by
the worst internal dispute in its history, over its response
earlier this year to the Salman Rushdie affair.
   Three members submitted letters of resignation, but the Academy,
whose members are chosen for life, refused to accept them. The
three have boycotted the crucial meetings at which the prize is
discussed and chosen.
   The three protested the Academy's refusal to condemn the death
sentence on Rushdie issued by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
early this year. Khomeini said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in his book
``The Satanic Verses.'' The British author has been in hiding ever
since.
   The Academy issued a statement supporting freedom of speech, but
declined to go further in accordance with its code of avoiding
political issues.
   Sture Allen, the Academy's secretary, said the dispute did not
interfere with the selection of this year's laureate.
