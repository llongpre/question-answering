<HEAD>Soviet Critic Hopes Solzhenitsyn's Works Will Be Published</HEAD>

   Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a great writer whose
works, now banned in the Soviet Union, should be made available in
his native land, a prominent Soviet critic said in an interview
published Sunday.
   The comments on the exiled Nobel Prize winner were made by
Natalya Ivanova and printed in the Moscow youth daily Moskovsky
Komsomolets. They were the most positive remarks on Solzhenitsyn to
appear in the official Soviet press in recent memory and a further
sign of an ongoing reassessment of his works.
   Solzhenitsyn, who spent eight years in labor camps under
dictator Josef Stalin, wrote ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' a
voluminous study of the political repression and purges that marred
Stalin's 29-year reign. Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
Stalin and his legacy have been sharply criticized.
   Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970,
was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 and stripped of his
Soviet nationality. He now lives in Cavendish, Vt., and is a U.S.
citizen.
   ``I consider that he is a very great writer,'' Ms. Ivanova was
quoted as telling Moskovsky Komsomolets in a wide-ranging interview
about contemporary Soviet literature.
   ``It is a great misfortune for our literature that the young
generation has been deprived of the possibility of reading his
books. I hope that this abnormal situation will be corrected.''
   Although the greater openness fostered by Gorbachev has led to
the publication of once-banned works by Boris Pasternak, Mikhail
Bulgakov and other Soviet authors, Solzhenitsyn has so far remained
off limits.
   The editor of the literary monthly ``Novy Mir'' has said he is
negotiating for the rights to print Solzhenitsyn's novel ``Cancer
Ward.'' But a work such as the ``Gulag'' triology, which maintains
that wide-scale political repression began in the Soviet Union
under Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin, is still at odds with
official ideology, which pins the blame on Stalin.
   Ms. Ivanova, whose literary criticism regularly appears in the
weekly magazine Ogonyok, also said she believed Solzhenitsyn should
be given his Soviet citizenship back.
