<LEADPARA>  On the day the 1991 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to South African
author Nadine Gordimer, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology announced the creation of a new series of ersatz Nobel Prizes for
individuals likely to have been overlooked by the Nobel Committee.;   The
award is named after Ignatius Nobel, "inventor of soda pop" and a "distant
cousin" of TNT discoverer Alfred Nobel, who created the namesake Nobel Prizes.
Among the first winners are Vice President Dan Quayle, junk-bond king Michael
Milken and physicist Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb.  </LEADPARA>

TO QUAYLE, MILKEN AND TELLER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The awards were presented Thursday evening by a group of MIT and Harvard
Nobel laureates that included Jerome Friedman and Henry Kendall (physics,
1990); Eric Chivian (peace, 1985); Sheldon Glashow (physics, 1979); and Dudley
Herschback (chemistry, 1986). None of the recipients was present.;   The 1991
Ig Nobel Prize for education was bestowed on Quayle, "consumer of time and
occupier of space, for demonstrating better than anyone the need for science
education.";   Milken received the 1991 Ig Nobel Prize for economics in
recognition of his status as "the father of the junk bond, to whom we are all
indebted." Master of Ceremonies Marc Abrahams, editor of the Journal of
Irreproducible Results, which is published at MIT, noted that "Unfortunately,
Mr. Milken is unable to attend the ceremony today. He has a previous 15- to
20-year engagement.";   Teller, the prime mover of the "star wars" program,
received the Ig Nobel Prize for peace "for his lifelong efforts to change the
meaning of peace as we know it.";   Each awardee received a small, frying
pan-shaped medal that screams when shaken, and parking passes valid in
Cambridge, Mass., between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. on Dec. 26.  </TEXT>
