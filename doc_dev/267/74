   Causing a stir in the Italian cultural world, a new
book and a newspaper have disclosed that Nobel laureate Eugenio
Montale signed literary articles that were actually written by a
friend.
   The country's literati had considered Montale the leading
Italian poet of the 20th century.
   The Milan-based newspaper Il Giornale recently published a
series of letters Montale wrote in 1950 to an American friend,
Henry Furst, asking him to put together several book reviews that
would appear under Montale's name.
   The deal also was detailed in a book about Furst published this
month, ``Dry Branches,'' by Mario Soldati.
   The disclosures surprised Italians, who grew up revering the
verses of the reclusive Montale, including ``Occasions,''
``Finisterre'' and a collection titled ``Cuttlefish Bones.''
   Montale, who often wrote of the sea in his native Genoa, won the
Nobel Prize in literature in 1975. He died in 1981 at age 85.
   Most commentators have expressed sympathy for Montale, who,
according to Soldati, arranged for the ghost-written articles
during a period in which he was very tired and felt unable to write.
   Another controversy has developed over a column by an Italian
Communist politician and poet, Pietro Ingrao, who said Montale had
a ``right to deceive,'' since capitalist society did not permit an
artist to make a living from poetry.
   In the letters published in Il Giornale, Montale told Furst he
could not fulfill his contract to write a monthly review of an
English or American book for the prestigious Milan newspaper
Corriere della Sera.
   The poet asked the American writer to do it for him, and
promised to turn over the payment he would have received.
   ``The problem for me is the reading, not the writing of the
article,'' Montale wrote, according to the published letters.
   ``It takes me a lot of effort even to read an Italian book,
imagine an English book! No one can imagine the life I am leading;
and if they knew _ at the newspaper _ instead of feeling sorry for
me they would show me the door.''
   Montale said he wanted to keep the contract with the newspaper
since he did not have much income.
   ``In time I will do the work, but now ... it is already
something if I don't imitate Pavese,'' he wrote, referring to the
well-known writer Cesare Pavese.
   In other letters, Montale thanks Furst for sending reviews,
cautions him not to make them too elegant and says that he has
given a more positive tone to Furst's review of a book by Ernest
Hemingway, ``since I know the author and I am part of a jury for
the prize named after him.''
   Furst, an author in his own right, was close friends with many
European writers in the 1950s and served for a time as literary
correspondent from Italy for The New York Times, according to Il
Giornale.
   ``The Montale case ... has become an occasion for raising again
the inexhaustible arguments about the shadowy collaborators of the
greats of literature,'' said the Italian weekly newsmagazine
Panorama.
   Ingrao said in a front-page article in the Communist newspaper
Il Manifesto that Montale had the right to deceive his newspaper,
``being that we are not able or willing to guarantee a poet even
the liberty to search, to interrogate, to interrogate himself, in
idleness.''
   He described Montale's act as rebellion against a consumer
society.
   But columnist Paolo Mieli responded in the Turin-based daily La
Stampa: ``There remains the sensation that this attempt to cast the
episode in terms of politics and ideology is false, above all when
compared with the intense drama of those long-ago letters to
Furst.''
