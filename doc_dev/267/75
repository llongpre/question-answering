<HEAD>Boris Pasternak's Son Collects 1958 Nobel Literature Prize</HEAD>

   The son of the late Russian author
Boris Pasternak received his father's Nobel literature prize
Saturday, 31 years after it was awarded.
   Soviet officials forced the writer to refuse the prize when it
was awarded to him in 1958 for his celebrated novel, ``Doctor
Zhivago.'' He died in 1960.
   A few days ago, Soviet authorities granted his 66-year-old son,
Yevgeny Pasternak, permission to travel to Stockholm to collect the
prize.
   ``Never, ever did I think this could happen ... but the
perestroika is so fast sometimes,'' Pasternak's son was quoted as
saying by the national news agency TT. Perestroika is Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's program of political and social
reform.
   The prize ceremony was held in the Nobel Hall in Stockholm's
Bourse House.
   Pasternak completed Doctor Zhivago in 1955, but the epic of
upheaval in 20th century Russia was banned in his homeland. It was
first published in Italy in 1957 and only last year in the Soviet
Union.
   ``This is a worthy ending of a tragedy ... and I am very
happy,'' the writer's son told the audience when he received the
Nobel medal.
   In the Soviet Union, Pasternak devotes himself to a museum built
in Peredelkino, outside Moscow, to honor his father's memory.
