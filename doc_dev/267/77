   A Brazilian engineer fighting the
destruction of the Amazon jungles, a Malaysian environmental group
and a British specialist in housing for the poor today won the
$100,000 Right Livelihood Award, sometimes called the ``alternative
Nobel prize.''
   An honorary award, which carries no cash prize, went to
Denmark's Inge Kemp Genefke, founder and director of the
International Rehabilitation and Research Center for Torture
Victims, for her work ``to help those whose lives have been
shattered by torture.''
   The award was established in 1980 by Swedish-German
philanthropist Baron Jakob von Uexkull to encourage practical
solutions to everyday problems.
   Von Uexkull sold a stamp collection to finance an initial
$500,000 endowment for the annual prizes. They will be awarded in
the Swedish parliament on Dec. 9, the eve of the Nobel prize
ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo, Norway.
   The 10-member jury includes von Uexkull, Norwegian explorer Thor
Heyerdahl, former Costa Rican President Rodrigo Carazo and Robert
Muller, a former U.N. assistant secretary general.
   The 1988 winners were Brazil's Jose Lutzenberger, the Friends of
the Earth group fighting the logging industry in the Malaysian
province of Sarawak, and John Turner, a London architect and author
of self-help programs for Third World housing development.
   Von Uexkull told a news conference that the award had ``gained
recognition'' since it was introduced and had helped draw attention
to environmental issues.
   The cash stipend, which the winners will share, is for specific
projects and not for personal use, according to the Right
Livelihood Foundation.
   The timing of the prize is linked to the announcement of the six
Nobel prizes to ensure maximum publicity. The Nobel Peace Prize,
given to the U.N. peacekeeping forces, was announced last week and
the laureates in literature, chemistry, phyisics, economics and
medicine will be made public over the next eight days.
   Von Uexkull created the prize because he believed the Nobel
prizes had become too specialized and removed from issues
concerning everyone.
   He said this year the winners were chosen from among 92
nominations, which can be submitted by anyone.
   The foundation cited Lutzenberger as ``the father of the
environmental movement in Brazil'' who has launched soil
regeneration projects and encourged posion-free agriculture.
   Lutzenberger, 61, quit his job with a Brazilian chemical company
in 1972 to campaign against the overuse of chemicals in farming.
   His criticism of projects funded by the World Bank raised an
environmental awareness into the bank's activities in Brazil and
elsewhere, the foundation said.
   Lutzenberger also helped raise the alarm over the clearing of
the Amazon rain forests for agriculture. ``An area the size of
France and Scotland is burning. At this rate the forests of Brazil
will be destroyed in 20 years,'' von Uexkull said.
   In Malaysia, Sahabat Alam, or The Friends of the Earth, was
recognized for its conflict with the authorities over the
deforestation in Sarawak.
   The foundation cited Harrison Ngau, 28, director of the Sarawak
office, who led a blockade against the a lumber company which it
said was owned by Environment and Tourism Minister James Wong.
   Ngau was arrested for 60 days and was still under orders
restricting his travel, the foundation said.
   John Turner, born in 1927, was honored for encouraging ``the
freedom of communities to plan, build and manage their hown
housing.''
   Turner, founder of the Associated Housing Advisory Services,
argued in a series of publications that Western urban development
should not be imposed on Third World home dwellers.
   The honorary award recognized Genefke's work with torture
victims in the Copenhagen-based research center.
   Von Uexkull said the has documented cases of torture and has
charged that as many as 25,000 people in the medical professions
have been involved in acts of torture.
