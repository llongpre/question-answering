   Octavio Paz said he would rather die than stop
writing poetry, which has unlocked doors to travel and diplomacy
and on Thursday brought him the Nobel Prize in literature.
   The 76-year-old Mexican author said he was in a Manhattan hotel
room ``sleeping peacefully'' when the phone rang with the news from
Sweden.
   ``I was very, very surprised,'' he told reporters. ``The prize
means a great lot, not in the sense it's a passport to immortality.
But it gives you the possibility of a wider audience. Even the most
expert writer needs an audience.''
   Paz, a former ambassador to India, is no stranger to praise. In
1981, he received the most important award in the Spanish-speaking
world, the Cervantes prize. In 1982, he captured the prestigious
American Neustadt Prize.
   ``Poetry is not a very popular art form these days, but it's an
essential part of human life,'' Paz said. ``Poetry is the memory of
a country, of language. Without poetry, people can't even talk
well.''
   ``I don't want to retire until I'm dead,'' he said.
   Paz, in New York for a Mexican art exhibit at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, answered questions in Spanish, French and English
from journalists from around the world.
   He spoke energetically behind a podium, his thick eyebrows and
full head of hair giving him a youthful presence. His blue eyes
calmly moved about the room, settling on each person he answered.
   Reflecting on his 25 years as a diplomat, he said poets must be
critics of society. He said the current century, with its two world
wars, concentration camps and the atomic bomb, had been ``very
cruel.''
   Paz resigned his job as ambassador to protest his government's
suppression of student demonstrations at the 1968 Olympic Games in
Mexico City.
   ``It has been a terrble century,'' said Paz. ``But we have had
great moments. Many poets have died in concentration camps.
   ``Now, we are seeing the coming back of freedom all over the
world and that is important. Art and also the great change of the
world has given me great pleasure,'' he said.
   He also reflected on years as a writer.
   ``We are born alone and the first thing is to be with others. I
have to communicate this thirst of communion. Language is a common
property. A writer is only the guardian of language, a collective
wealth,'' said Paz.
   ``My only job,'' he said, ``was to write the best I could.''
