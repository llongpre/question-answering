Three members of the Nobel Prize selection committee for literature have quit 
over the body's refusal to speak out against threats to British author Salman 
Rushdie, but the committee has refused to let them go. 
</P>
<P>
Novelists Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten submitted their resignations to 
Sweden's Academy of Letters with a third member, Werner Aspenstrom, Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Academy Chairman Sture Allen said the resignations could not be accepted. "The 
work will go on. Members serve for life so we cannot grant their resignation 
requests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's late leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on Muslims 
worldwide to kill Rushdie for blasphemy against Islam in his book "The Satanic 
Verses." Rushdie has been forced into hiding by the threat. 
</P>
<P>
In March the 18-member Academy issued a statement deploring attacks on freedom 
of speech but failed to mention Iran or the Indian-born author. It is the first 
time since the Academy was founded in 1786 that a disagreement has been made 
public. The Academy is to announce the 1989 Nobel Prize winner in literature 
next month.
