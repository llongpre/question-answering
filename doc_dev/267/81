   ``I thought I was still asleep and dreaming,'' Jerome I.
Friedman, one of two Americans who won the Nobel Prize in physics,
said today after hearing the news that he had been honored by the
Swedish Academy of Sciences.
   Friedman and Henry W. Kendall won the prize with a third
researcher, Canadian Richard E. Taylor, for work in the late 1960s
that showed protons and neutrons, once thought to be fundamental
particles, were made up of smaller components called quarks.
   American Elias James Corey of Harvard University won the prize
in chemistry for research that simplified the production of
plastics and other artificial fibers, paints and dyes, pesticides
and drugs. Corey, 62, has synthesized about 100 important drugs and
other natural products, the academy said.
   Corey said he was walking into the Harvard chemistry building
today when a graduate student told him he had won.
   ``This is a statistically improbable event. There are so many
scientists who are so deserving,'' he said.
   He said that for years people had said he was nominated, ``but I
have maintained solid skepticism.''
   ``My philosphy has been to try to be as logical as I can. I try
to teach my science,'' Corey said.
   About 15 students celebrated outside Corey's office with cans of
beer - they said they couldn't afford champagne.
   ``It's an overwhelming experience. I never expected it,''
Friedman said from his hotel room in Fort Worth, Texas, where he
was attending a conference.
   Friedman, 60, and Kendall, 63, are professors at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Taylor, 60, born in Medicine
Hat, Alberta, is a professor at Stanford University. Friedman lives
in Brookline, Mass., and Kendall in Sharon, Mass.
   Taylor, contacted at his Stanford, Calif., home this morning,
said he was surprised to hear he had been awarded the prize for his
work on the quarks, now believed to be the basic building blocks of
matter.
   ``One thing that's remarkable is how little you say when the
conversation starts with the secretary of the academy in Sweden,''
said Taylor, who had been asleep when he was notified about 4 a.m.
   ``It's a big deal,'' he conceded. ``On the other hand, I know a
great many people who have won the Nobel Prize. It's a great
honor.''
   The Nobelists, who will share the $700,000 physics prize,
conducted a series of experiments at Stanford between 1968 and 1972
involving the acceleration of protons in order to better examine
their structures.
   That process, Taylor said, started an even longer process where
more quarks were discovered.
   ``This was one step in the chain to forge that essential
understanding we have now of the elementary particles,'' he said.
   Taylor said he was most influenced by W.K.H. Panofsky, then
director of the Stanford Linear Acceleration Center.
   ``It was his vision and hard work that generated the accelerator
to do the experiment,'' Taylor said. ``I think of him as directly
responsible.''
   Panofsky is now director emeritus of the center, which is
operated by Stanford for the Department of Energy.
   ``It was one of the profound contributions made'' to the field,
Panofsky said when contacted at his Los Altos, Calif., home this
morning. ``And it came out differently from the way the thing was
intended. I'm very happy. That's about all I can say.''
   Panofsky said he wasn't surprised that the three won the Nobel
Prize nearly 20 years after the conclusion of their experiments.
   ``I knew it was clearly a classical achievement that changed the
way one looked at the structure of things,'' he said. ``It was
something that was clearly deserved for a long time, and it was
sooner or later, one would hope, that this would happen.''
   Friedman said curiosity led them to it.
   ``As human beings, we have great curiosity about how nature
works. ... human beings try to understand everything,'' he said.
   ``One never knows what the application of basic research will
be,'' he added. ``Knowing what the structure of matter is,
ultimately has to have some effect on how you model the entire
structure of things.''
