   The money awarded to Nobel Prize
winners is being raised this year to $653,000 each from $489,000,
the head of the Nobel Foundation was quoted as saying Sunday.
   The foundation is hoping to eventually make the prize _ after
inflation _ worth what it was in 1901, said Stig Ramel. His
comments appeared in the Svenska Dagbladet.
   In 1901, the first year the Nobels were awarded, the prize money
was 150,000 kronor. In today's terms, that would be $784,000. Last
year's prizes were worth about $489,000 each.
   Svenska Dagbladet said this year's increase in prize money was
secured by a planned sale of the foundation's 22 percent stake in
the real estate company Bevaringen. Further increases are planned.
   The inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, created the Nobel prizes
in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.
   In 1968, Sweden's central bank instituted a sixth prize, the
Nobel memorial economics prize, which carries the same prize sum as
the others.
   The Nobels are awarded in September and October.
