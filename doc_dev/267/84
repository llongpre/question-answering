   The United Nations chief accepted the Nobel
Peace Prize on behalf of U.N. peacekeeping troops on Saturday and
said their success illustrates a new mood of understanding and
common sense in the world.
   But the U.N. secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, also
said the peacekeepers' crucial mission is threatened because the
United States and other nations don't pay their dues to the world
body.
   ``Never before in history have military forces been employed
internationally not to wage war, not to establish domination and not
to serve the interests of any power or group of powers, but rather
to prevent conflict between peoples,'' Perez de Cuellar told an
audience that included King Olav V.
   Despite conflicts and terrible new weapons, ``collective
responsibility for peace can be evolved in a truly representative
international system,'' Perez de Cuellar said. ``There is a new mood
of understanding and common sense.''
   His hands appeared to shake with emotion as he accepted the gold
medal and prize certificate from Egil Aarvik, chairman of the
Norwegian Nobel Committee. The peacekeeping forces are the first
military force ever to win the award.
   In a white-tie ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, five Americans
shared the science prizes with three West Germans, a Briton and a
Frenchman.
   Literature laureate Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt could not attend for
health reasons and was represented at the ceremony by two daughters.
He is the first Arab writer to win the prestigious award.
   Sweden's King, Carl XVI Gustaf, awarded the prize for physics to
Americans Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger.
   Lederman said the greatest benefit of the ``awesome tradition''
of the Nobel Prizes was to encourage greater public understanding of
the sciences. He quipped that it was the scientist's ``modest goal
to understand the universe.''
   Johann Diesenhofer, Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel, all West
Germans, received the chemistry award.
   Sir James Black of Britain shared the medicine prize with
Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings, both of the United
States, and Maurice Allais of France won the memorial prize in
economics.
   This year's prizes are worth $416,000 per category. For reasons
never explained, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel stipulated in
his will that the peace prize be awarded in Norway, and the other
prizes in Sweden.
   The first prizes were handed out in 1901, and the Nobel Memorial
Prize in Economics was set up in 1968 by the National Bank of Sweden.
   An audience of 600 at Oslo University's Aula Hall observed a
moment of silence for the 733 peacekeepers who have died on duty.
   The first U.N. force went to the Middle East in 1948. Since then,
half a million soldiers from 58 countries have served in trouble
spots around the world, keeping combatants apart and monitoring
cease-fires.
   The U.N. has 10,000 soldiers in the field today, and Perez de
Cuellar noted that one of them, U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins, is held by kidnapers in Lebanon. He appealed for Higgins'
release.
   On Friday, Perez de Cuellar accepted the money portion of the
award, worth $416,000, but said peacekeeping forces were threatened
by failure of the United States and other countries to pay their
U.N. dues.
   ``I don't know how we're going to cope financially,'' he told
reporters. U.N. members owe about $450 million in back dues, and the
United States is the biggest debtor with nearly $350 million
outstanding, he said.
   The Reagan administration has been holding back money from the
world body on grounds that is overstaffed, wasteful and has an
anti-Western bias.
   President Reagan has said the debt will be paid eventually, but
Perez de Cuellar suggested that could come too late.
   In addition to the seven peacekeeping missions now on duty,
additional forces have been suggested as early as next year for
South-West Africa, the Western Sahara, Afghanistan, Cambodia and
Central America.
   Perez de Cuellar said the forces act as an international police
force.
   ``Peacekeeping uses soldiers as servants of peace rather than as
the instruments of war. It introduces to the military sphere the
principle of non-violence,'' he said.
   ``We can, and must, achieve what we have dreamed of for so long,
that is to make the rule of law the standard rather than the
exception in world affairs.''
   Afer the ceremony, Perez de Cuellar left for Paris to attend
ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Human Rights
Convention.
