   The Soviet Writers Union has decided to create a
museum to Boris Pasternak, who was forced out of the organization
for publishing his Nobel Prize-winning novel ``Doctor Zhivago,'' a
newspaper said Wednesday.
   The weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta said the secretariat of the
Writers Union had decided to turn Pasternak's house in the rural
writers' colony of Peredelkino just west of Moscow into a museum.
   It was at that house that Pasternak wrote the novel that won him
the 1957 Nobel Prize for Literature.
   Pasternak was forced to turn down the prize and died in disgrace
in 1960.
   But the Soviet Union is re-evaluating Pasternak under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected
topics.
   Poet Andrei Voznesensky told the newspaper that Pasternak name
remains ``in the epicenter of a literary struggle'' and that honors
now bestowed on him were possible only because of glasnost.
   Pasternak was reinstated to the Writers Union in February 1987,
and ``Doctor Zhivago'' was published earlier this year in the
literary journal Novy Mir.
