<TEXT>     Singer's stories and novels, written in Yiddish and redolent of the
mysticism of Jewish folklore, often dealt with his upbringing as a rabbi's son
in Warsaw and in a small town in eastern Poland. But he also wrote about
loneliness in drab cafeterias, worldliness in Miami Beach and chance
acquaintanceship on the sidewalks of upper Broadway.;    Throughout his
career, he wrote about human passions and high emotions.;    "God gave us so
many emotions and such strong ones," he once said in an interview. "Every
human being, even if he is an idiot, is a millionaire in emotions.";    Most
of his fiction first appeared in Yiddish in the Jewish Daily Forward, a
newspaper in New York City that is now called the Jewish Forward. It has had
an English-language sister publication since last year.;    But Singer's
writing reached a large international public through translations into English
and many other languages. Its worldwide appeal was noted in the citation that
accompanied his Nobel Prize in 1978.;    The citation praised his "impassioned
narratives, which, with roots in a Polish-Jewish cultural tradition, bring
universal human conditions to life.";    New York Times critic Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt wrote that this was "another way of saying what admirers have
always observed about Singer: that he has made of the East European Jew an
exemplar of the suffering modern man who has been exiled from his divine
inheritance.";    Singer's more than 30 books ranged from the novel "Satan in
Goray," which came out in 1935, to the novel "Scum," which was serialized in
the Jewish Daily Forward in 1967 and published in book form this year. They
include the much-praised "A Crown of Feathers" (1973) and other collections of
short stories. Many of his stories also appeared in the New Yorker.;    Singer
was a modest man with an unassuming and unliterary style of life: He liked to
wear plain business suits and he preferred dairy restaurants to writers' bars.
But his life was enlivened by his passion for metaphysics, his eye for a
pretty ankle and his occasional flair for the dramatic. When he gave his Nobel
Prize lecture in December 1978, he startled the dignitaries in the Stockholm
auditorium by breaking into Yiddish.;    In awarding him the prize, he said,
the Swedish Academy was also honoring "a loshon fun golus, ohn a land, ohn
grenitzen, nisht gshtitzt fun kein shum meluchoch" -- "a language of exile,
without a land, without frontiers, not supported by any government.";    In
his speech, a deft summary of what he thought about his work, Singer also
voiced his long-held view that one main duty of the writer was to keep the
reader interested.;    "The storyteller of our time, as in any other time,
must be an entertainer of the spirit in the full sense of the word, not just a
preacher of social and political ideals," he declared, speaking in English.;  
 "Nonetheless, it is also true that the serious writer of our time must be
deeply concerned about the problems of his generation." These, he said,
included the decline of the power of religion and the weakening of the
family.;    Isaac Bashevis Singer was born on July 14, 1904, to Bathsheba
Zylberman Singer in Radzymin, a flour-milling town 15 miles northeast of
Warsaw. When he was 4, his family moved to Warsaw, and his father set up a
rabbinical court in the shabby building where they lived.;    As a boy, Isaac
received a traditional Jewish schooling and spent time with his maternal
grandmother in the small town of Bilgoraj, in the countryside of eastern
Poland. His parents wanted him to be a rabbi, and he obliged them by enrolling
at the Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary in Warsaw.;    But in his early 20s,
Singer made a momentous decision: He would drop his religious studies and
become a secular writer. In taking the step, he was greatly influenced by his
older brother, Israel Joseph Singer.;    In 1932, Singer became an editor of
the Yiddish literary journal Globus, which published his first novel in
installments. The work was "Satan in Goray," which drew in part on the Jewish
small-town life he had experienced in Bilgoraj.;    In 1935, having become
alarmed at the growing menace of Nazism and the worsening conditions among
Polish Jews, Singer set sail for the United States, where his brother had
settled.;    In 1940, he married Alma Haimann, a stylish emigre from Germany,
and he became a United States citizen in 1943.;    In addition to his wife,
Singer is survived by a son from an earlier marriage, Israel Zamir, of Gilboa,
Israel, a writer and translator, and four grandchildren.  </TEXT>
