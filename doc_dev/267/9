   The government newspaper said Satuday
that an Egyptian novelist won this year's Nobel Prize for
literature becuase he supported the peace accord between Egypt and
Israel.
   ``Finally an Arab writer has won the Nobel Prize,'' the paper,
Al-thawra, said. ``We wish he had not. Because it would have been
better for him and more honorable for us.''
   The Swedish Academy on Thursday named Egyptian novelist Neguib
Mahfouz for the literature award. It was the first time an Arab
writer has won the prize.
   Mahfouz supported the Camp David peace treaty signed in 1979 by
the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, then
Israel's prime minister. Sadat and Begin subsequently were awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Syria is a bitter critic of the U.S.-brokered peace pact and has
attacked the awards to Sadat and Begin.
   Describing the literature prize as ``Western bait,'' Al-thawra
said its ``significance is to tell Arab writers `get dirty in the
swamp of Camp David as a dissident like Neguib Mahfouz and you will
get the award.'''
