   From president to pushcart vendor, most
Mexicans reacted with pride Thursday to Octavio Paz' achievement on
being named the first Mexican Nobel Prize for literature.
   Among fellow writers, many of the congratulations were delivered
with the air of disdain that characterizes the left-leaning
intellectual community's attitude toward its senior defector.
   ``As a poet he has great respect, less as an essayist and none
as a politician,'' fiction writer Paco Ignacio Taibo was quoted as
saying by the Excelsior news service. ``I hope that Octavio Paz
doesn't become a spokesman for the right.''
   Among the more outrageous responses was that of filmmaker Rafael
Corkidi, who charged the prize was the result of publicity that the
television chain Televisa spends on Paz.
   Televisa, which owns the only private television channels in
Mexico, frequently is criticized for leaning to the right in its
news coverage and favoring middle-of-the-road talent in its
programming. The giant network sends out photographs of Paz among
its promotional materials.
   ``Paz' undeniable literary value is wasted with sad speeches he
gives in favor of the company,'' Corkidi said at a poetry festival
in Guadalajara.
   Paz' criticism of leftist intellectuals - and aside from Paz not
many intellectuals in Mexico are anything but - long has estranged
him from the country's literary mainstream, if such a thing exists.
   But Mexican writers who have worked with Paz, such as Salvador
Elizondo, a collaborator on the magazine Vuelta, called the prize
well-deserved.
   ``In the cultural order it gives distinction to one of the most
important figures of the Spanish language,'' Elizondo said.
   ``Despite the controversy and disagreement that Paz' ideological
position generates, his creative quality is indisputable,'' said
Jaime Labastida, a poet who stands opposed to Paz on many political
issues.
   In recent months, Paz has been criticized for traveling overseas
in the retinue of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Salinas, attending meetings in Venezuela on Thursday, sent a
congratulatory message to Paz.
   ``He is a poet and writer of whom we Mexicans feel proud. He has
a universal stature,'' said the president, praising Paz for ``his
deep Mexican and Latin American vision.''
   Paz is already one of Mexico's best-selling writers. Many
students are assigned in school his ``Labyrinth of Solitude,'' a
pithy investigation of the Mexican national character.
   At the Alameda park in downtown Mexico City, the award generated
excitement among a group of sidewalk booksellers.
   Rogelio Galindo of the Sotano bookshop said he had sold 250
copies of Paz' latest work, ``A Small Chronicle of Great Days,''
the past three months.
   ``For him it's good. For me, it's marvelous,'' said Manuel
Marquez, as he rushed to rescue his books from an afternoon rain.
Scooping them off a patch of cardboard on the sidewalk, Marquez
stacked them onto a cart.
   ``We hope this will lead us to read more books and by all
writers,'' said Ricardo Contreras Plata, who has sold books for 22
years on a busy streetcorner opposite Mexico's Palace of Fine Arts.
   Enrique Fuente, owner of the Madero Bookstore, said the award
was ``practically a merchandizing device'' for selling Paz' books.
   ``It's good because he's a Mexican,'' said bookshop customer
Roman Picazo.
   Salvador Diaz Contera, a professor of Greek literature who was
shopping at the Madero, praised Paz as ``one of the best writers''
in Mexico, although he said this is not a great era for Mexican
writers.
   He said Paz' image had suffered among intellectuals because he
seemed to have abandoned his socialist ideals and had become
friendly with the government.
   Paz won many fans among the young in 1968 when he resigned as
ambassador to India in protest over the bloody army attack on
student protesters.
   ``Now he has changed when he sees the retreat of the socialist
ideology in a great part of the world,'' Diaz said.
   In fact Paz began criticizing Marxist governments in the 1970s,
a period that might be construed as revolutionary Socialism's
heyday.
