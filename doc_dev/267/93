   In his sensuous poetry imbued with mythology and politics,
Octavio Paz has helped shape Mexico's idea of itself and long
served as interpreter of his nation's soul for the West.
   He finds company among the Latin American literary greats who
have profoundly influenced the politics of their nations and
channeled their cultures into the mainstream of world literature.
   Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes has called Paz the ``greatest
living Mexican writer, great renovator of the Spanish language,
great universal poet and essayist.''
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa said Paz was ``one of the
greatest poets that the Spanish-language world has produced and, at
the same time, a great humanist.''
   But the self-styled socialist and democrat has been heavily
criticized by the Mexican left and virtually ostacized by his peers
for his political views, which defy allegiance to either left or
right.
   He has chosen the life of political dissident in his country.
   Paz resigned from a 25-year diplomatic career to protest the
government's suppression of student demonstrations during the 1968
Olympic Games in Mexico City, and has since devoted himself to
writing and lecturing. He received an honorary doctorate from
Harvard University in 1980.
   The newest Nobel laureate is known in Mexico as a poet,
essayist, diplomat, critic, professor, translator, polemicist and
founder of literary journals.
   His poetry and essays cover concerns ranging from surrealism and
socialism to archaeology and Oriental philosophy. But above all,
Paz, 76, is immersed in his country's geography, climate and
mythology.
   ``Our history,'' writes Paz, ``has been a discontinuous process
of fits and starts: at times a dance, at others a lethargy
interrupted by a sudden, violent awakening.''
   ``Again and again, we Spanish and Spanish-Americans rub eyes and
ask: What time is it in world history? Our time never coincides
with other times. We are always either ahead or behind.''
   Among his best-known works are ``The Labyrinth of Solitude'' - a
classic analysis of the Mexican psyche - and his long, sensuous
poems ``Sun Stone'' and ``Blanca.''
   Critics have said his writing expresses Paz's sense of the deep
loneliness of man, which can be transcended only through attempts
at communion, sexual love, compassion and faith.
   Paz describes poetry as ``the memory of a country,'' and says
poets must be critics of their times.
   And the giant of Mexican letters has never shunned controversy.
His essays have angered both the left and the right.
   He miffed the leftist literati by equating President Fidel
Castro of Cuba with former Chilean strongman Augusto Pinochet and
dismissing the 1979 leftist revolution in Nicaragua as
``inconsequential.''
   ``I am an interlocutor who is hated and read by the left,'' he
once said.
   At the same time, he has frequently denounced the Institutional
Revolutionary Party - which has ruled Mexico for 61 years - as
corrupt and out of touch with the people it was formed to help.
   Paz was born in Mexico City on March 31, 1914 into what he has
described as a ``typical Mexican family.'' His mother's relatives
emigrated from Andalusia in Spain and his father's ancestors were
Mexicans of Indian descent.
   His paternal grandfather was a writer, journalist and political
activist who espoused the cause of the peasantry. It was in his
vast private library that the young Paz first read extensively.
   His father, a lawyer, embraced the Mexican revolution of 1910
and was an ardent supporter of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano
Zapata. The young writer was active in Marxist movements at the
University of Mexico.
   But Paz's family was ruined during the upheavals of the civil
war and he spent his boyhood in a suburb of Mexico City in a large
house that was, he once said, ``crumbling to bits.''
   ``As rooms collapsed,'' he recalled in Rita Guibert's 1973 book,
``Seven Voices,'' ``we moved the furniture into others.'' He lived
for a time in a large room with only part of a wall.
   At 17, Paz founded the avant-garde literary journal,
``Barrandal,'' and at 19 published his first book of poetry,
``Forest Moon.''
   He went to Spain for a year during the Spanish Civil War and
took up the anti-Franco republican cause. He told Guibert that
Spain ``taught me the meaning of the word `fraternity.'''
   Paz used such experiences and the insights they gave him to
write the scores of essays and hundreds of poems that have helped
shape Mexico's idea of itself and the way in which it is perceived
abroad.
   For this work, he on Thursday won one of the world's top prizes
for a writer, the Nobel Prize for literature.
