   All Nobel Prize laureates will be
invited to Stockholm in 1991 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of
the first award, the Nobel board of directors said Tuesday.
   Invitations were being sent to about 230 prize-winners to
commemorate ``Nobel Jubilee _ '91,'' the board said.
   Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite who died in 1896,
bequeathed his fortune to a foundation to finance prizes in physics,
chemistry, medicine, literature and the Nobel Peace Prize. The first
awards were made in 1901. A prize for economics was added in 1968.
