   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
accepted the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize in absentia today. He said
problems in his homeland prevented him from coming to the awards
ceremony.
   ``I do not regard the the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize as an award to
me personally, but as a recognition of what we call perestroika and
innovative political thinking, which is of vital significance for
human destinies all over the world,'' Gorbachev said in a message
from Moscow.
   In an acceptance speech read by his envoy, Anatoly Kovalyov,
Gorbachev promised to continue the process of openness and reform.
Kovalyov said the prize's $715,000 cash award probably would be
donated to worthy causes.
   Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine and
economics were to be awarded later today in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the 71st Peace Prize
recognized Gorbachev's international efforts, more than his
domestic policies.
   But committee leader Gidske Anderson said at the Oslo City Hall
ceremony that she hoped the award would be seen as ``a helping hand
in an hour of need'' as Gorbachev and the Soviet people cope with
the restructing of their economy and government.
   ``This transformation is inevitably a painful porcess, involving
great sacrifice,'' she said. Norway's royalty, government leaders
and roughly 900 guests applauded as Anderson presented the Peace
Prize medal and diploma to Gorbachev's stand-in.
   Gorbachev had hoped to attend the ceremony in person, but last
month said problems at home required his attention ``hour by
hour.''
   Demonstrators in Moscow protested the award Sunday and today,
blaming Gorbachev for ethnic and political violence in his own
country.
   Gorbachev, quoting the 18th Century German philospher Immanuel
Kant, said in his acceptance speech: ``Kant prophesized that
mankind would one day be faced with a dilemma: either to be joined
in a true union of nations or to perish in a war of annihilation
ending in the extinction of the human race.
   ``Now, as we move from the second to the third millennium, the
clock has struck the moment of truth,'' Gorbachev wrote.
   The year 1990 represents a turning point, he said. ``It marks
the end of the unnatural division of Europe. Germany has been
reunited. We have begun to resolutely tear down the material
foundations of a military, political and ideological
confrontation.''
   An unofficial translation of Gorbachev's two-page statement said
the Peace Prize recognized that perestroika and reform no longer
belong to Soviets alone.
   ``They are the property of the whole of mankind and are an
inseparable part of its destiny, and of a safe, peaceful future,''
the text said.
   Gorbachev thanked Norway, and the West, for supporting the
Soviet Union's struggle to adopt greater openness and freer markets
- a struggle that has unleashed anger, protests and frustation in
his own country due to shortages of food and products.
   But Anderson said the 1990 award very much reflected the wishes
of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite who endowed the
Nobel prizes in his 1896 will.
   ``Nobel wanted the prize to be awarded to someone who had worked
to promote `fraternity between nations' ... to someone who actively
promoted a reduction in `standing armies' and worked for the
`holding of peace congresses,''' she said in her prepared remarks.
   Gorbachev is the the third eastern European who has not received
his prize in person since 1975.
   ``The award this year ... is an historic event not least because
of some of the previous awards made by our committee,'' Anderson
said.
   She said the 1975 award to Soviet human rights champion Andrei
Sakharov and the 1983 award to Poland's Lech Walesa were greeted
``with cool hostility in the Soviet Union and Poland.''
   Neither laurate was able to attend the ceremony, and their
governments rejected everything the committee stood for, she said.
Now the Soviet president has accepted the same award.
