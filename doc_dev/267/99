<TEXT>
The West Indian poet and dramatist Derek Walcott has been awarded the 1992
Nobel Literature Prize.
The award is both fitting and deserved because the kind of Caribbean poetry
that Walcott's work represents has helped breathe new life into English
poetry in general, whether written in England, America or elsewhere. It has
drawn the attentions of poets and their audiences back to the fundamental
importance of the relationship between poetry, song and dance.
Walcott's most recent long poem, the epic-length Omeros (Faber, Pounds
9.99), drew together many of the themes that his work had been exploring
since the late 1940s: how to reconcile the Old World and the New; the world
of European literature to which his British colonial education had given him
access, and the world of the Caribbean itself, with its dark and largely
unwritten history of slavery.
Walcott's work can be as erudite and intellectually taxing as any other
poet's of our century; but it also has the rhythmic expressiveness and
joyous sensuality of a body in motion.
