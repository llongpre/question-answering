<LEADPARA>  Life is not a bowl of cherries for inmate Chester Pitts.;    Pitts recently
sued the Luv-Ly Pie Company -- slogan: "It's Luv at First Bite" -- and the
prison warden at Soledad Correctional Training Facility. The inmate complains
he was served a packaged cherry pie at dinner on a January night two years ago
and injured his jaw by chomping down on a seed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pitts was even more outraged when he discovered a second seed in the same
pie. But the state Court of Appeal in San Jose ruled this month that Pitts
doesn't have a case.;    The justices' decision came after an exhaustive
review of past precedents, including lawsuits filed over chicken bones in a
chicken pie, beef bone in a hamburger sandwich -- even a pearl discovered in a
fried oyster.;    "Perfection is not required in the preparation of food
products," Justice Christopher Cottle wrote in the court's 12-page decision.; 
  A cherry pit is a natural by-product, and a consumer might readily expect to
find one in a pie, Cottle reasoned. He added that the experience of other
inmates, who also found seeds in their pies, should have put Pitts on his
guard.;    Finally, Cottle cited the package wrapper that Pitts sent to the
court as evidence.;    The court has returned the actual wrapper to Pitts. A
clerk said it was inappropriate to place in the permanent file. But Cottle
quoted the label in his ruling.;    "FRUIT PIES. CHERRY," it said. "REAL
CHERRIES -- WATCH FOR PITS."  </TEXT>
