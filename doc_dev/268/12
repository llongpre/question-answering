"Why don't they just let him be crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
Actor Vincent Price is sitting in the sun-filled living room of his Beverly 
Hills bungalow, sipping pinot and talking about Edgar Allan Poe. Art crowds the 
walls of the room and treasures from all over the world jam every available 
table surface. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to prove he wasn't crazy," Price continues, shaking his head. 
"He was the greatest American writer. He invented the romantic lyric song poem, 
the Gothic tale, the detective story. Why don't they just leave him alone?" 
</P>
<P>
The moment becomes a preview of sorts. On Oct. 25, Price will visit the Robert 
Mondavi Wine and Food Center in Costa Mesa to appear at a dinner dubbed "Price, 
Pinot and Poe." 
</P>
<P>
The actor is delighted about the chance to visit Orange County to sample pinot 
noir, dine (on "pumpkin, pigeon and pears," says an organizer) and entertain 
more than 100 guests with poetry by Poe. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a lot of movie roles based on Poe," Price says. " 'The Tell-Tale 
Heart,' 'The Masque of the Red Death,' 'The Pit and the Pendulum,' 'The Cask of 
Amontillado.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing then that intrigued me most about Poe was that he is the 
kind of author -- there's one for every country -- that kids think they have to 
read. They forget he is the greatest writer of his kind in the world, that his 
influence on art is incredible. Everybody thinks of Poe as the bogeyman." 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for Price to recite the macabre at the Mondavi. "I hope to bring 
some of Poe's romantic works to the dinner," Price says. "About 65 percent of 
his pieces are very sophisticated and romantic, very unlike the others." 
</P>
<P>
Price's love affair with wine began "years ago in St. Louis, Mo. -- where I was 
brought up," he says. "Where we just had grapes. You know, wine started with 
grapes; there weren't always these fancy names and things. It was wonderful 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in wine. I worked with the Wine Institute before 
it was called the Wine Institute. I was always trying to get people to learn 
about wine. It could be pretty terrible in those days unless you knew which 
wine to drink." 
</P>
<P>
Price's knowledge of the grape is what led Eric Hansen, director of the Mondavi 
Center, to ask the legendary actor to come to Costa Mesa. Last year, Hansen 
invited Price to speak about food and wine at the Kapalua Bay Club on Maui, 
Hawaii, at an annual wine symposium. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Price was wonderful," Hansen says. (Included in the witty actor's speech 
was a recipe for dishwasher trout that he'd whipped up for Johnny Carson on 
"The Tonight Show": "Tightly wrap trout in foil with lemon, wine, parsley, salt 
and pepper. Put it through the whole cycle. No soap!") Also appearing at the 
symposium was "Jeopardy" game show host Alex Trebek. ("I hope to have Trebek -- 
a great cook -- appear at the Mondavi one of these days soon," Hansen says.) 
</P>
<P>
"At the Mondavi Center we like to associate wine with the arts," Hansen 
explains. "And when I came to the idea that it would be great to have poetry, I 
thought of Mr. Price. Let's just say we're elevating Poe and pinot to very good 
company." 
</P>
<P>
When it came time for Price to have his picture taken for this story, he donned 
a straw hat and strolled slowly into his garden -- as packed with flowering 
plants and statuary as his house is with art and souvenir treasures. 
</P>
<P>
"I love hats," says the suave veteran of such film classics as "Laura" with 
Gene Tierney and "Victoria Regina" with Helen Hayes. "Do you think I should 
have dressed up more? When you look at the French magazines you always see 
people drinking wine casually. It doesn't always have to be a dress-up kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Cooking up gourmet fare for the event will be Gary Jenanyan, head chef of the 
"Great Chefs Program" for the Robert Mondavi winery in Napa Valley, and Rosanne 
Ruiz, formerly of the Sorrento Grill in Laguna Beach and now in-house chef for 
the local Mondavi Center. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the guest list for "Price, Pinot and Poe" is film producer Tony 
Bill, owner with Liza Minelli and Dudley Moore of the 72nd Market Street 
restaurant in Los Angeles.
