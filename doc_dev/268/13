<LEADPARA>  The study of chaos, the mathematical underpinning of such seemingly erratic
shapes as coastlines and clouds and such elusive processes as the weather,
once required professional training and powerful computers.;    The
mathematics is still not elementary, but now anyone with the kind of computer
found in many homes and offices can experiment with the often-haunting
products of chaos theory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Relatively simple procedures, repeated time and again, result in images
that uncannily recall colonies of cells living and dying, or star systems
developing, or the whorls of the nautilus.;    Based on book; James Gleick's
Chaos: the Software, is a package based on Gleick's 1987 book, "Chaos: Making
a New Science," published by Viking. That volume explained the development of
chaos theory perhaps as well as it can be explained to a non-mathematician.;  
 The software brings it alive, and in full color, on the screen of a personal
computer. The program is self-contained, and it is accompanied by an excellent
manual of more than 200 pages; it would also make a fine companion to a
reading, or rereading, of the book.;    Chaos consists of six separate but
related programs, each dealing with an aspect of the inquiry and all working
more or less the same way. They can be operated from the keyboard alone or
with a combination of keyboard and mouse.;    The six programs are: the
Mandelbrot sets, magnets and pendulum, strange attractors, the chaos game,
fractal forgeries, and toy universes. Each gets a chapter of the manual and is
organized in a similar way. The chapters are self-contained. If you don't give
a hoot about the bulbous Mandelbrot sets of shapes, you can plunge ahead to
fractal forgeries.;    The instructions for the magnets and pendulum section,
to choose one chapter as an example, begin with a brief discussion of the
dynamics of pendulums.;    A swinging pendulum; "One simple example is the
case of a pendulum swinging above some magnets, all capable of attracting and
grabbing onto the pendulum's bob," the manual says. "The bob swings back and
forth, around and about, first looping in the ambit of one or two of the
magnets, then suddenly jumping to another region.;    "It becomes almost
impossible to predict where it will finally settle, until the very last
minute. As in so many chaotic systems, the slightest change in the starting
point or in the physical setup -- the positions and strengths of the magnets,
the force and friction on the bob -- can entirely change the outcome.";    The
first simulation shows six blue circles, representing positive magnets,
forming a large circle. After you start the program, the bob moves around the
screen, leaving a complex trail until it eventually sticks to one of the
magnets. Then you are invited to change the layout, by adding or moving
magnets, to see the resulting change in the bob's movements.;    There are six
other layouts of differing numbers of magnets, some positive and some
negative, arranged in various patterns. Each simulation can be run at the
greatest speed your computer is capable of, slowed down for clarity or even
cycled through one step at a time.;    Finally, a series of menus, called up
by pressing a function key or clicking the mouse button, allow you to make an
almost infinite number of changes in the opening conditions -- charge, force,
friction, use of color and so forth. If you create a layout you especially
like, it can be saved on a disk.;    Several pages at the end of the chapter
explain the mathematics behind the simulation. But understanding the
mathematics is not necessary to run the many different, and sometimes
beautiful, simulations.;    Graphics capability; Aside from its appeal to
scientists and science and mathematics hobbyists, Chaos can generate displays
for business presentations, video art and other graphic needs.;    Gleick is a
former editor and reporter for the New York Times. The software was prepared
by, among others, Rudy Rucker, a professor of mathematics and computer science
at San Jose State University and the author of popular books on mathematics as
well as science fiction novels.;    Rucker's program, CA Lab: Rudy Rucker's
Cellular Automata Laboratory, was the first of what Autodesk hopes will be a
series of science programs. Chaos is the second.;    Chaos requires a PC/XT,
PC/AT or PS/2 computer or compatible with 640 kilobytes of working memory, two
floppy disk drives or one floppy and one hard drive, DOS 2.0 or later and a
color monitor with either an EGA or VGA graphics card.;    A math
co-processor, which takes the burden of calculations off the main chip, is
recommended but not required. The program is supplied on four 5 1/4-inch disks
and two 3 1/2-inch disks. The suggested retail price is $59.95.;    James
Gleick's Chaos: the Software is a product of Autodesk, 2320 Marinship Way,
