<TEXT>
Sir, May I offer a simple solution to the signalmen's dispute (and indeed to
all such differences). Under pendulum arbitration, an arbitrator is
appointed whose task is to find for one side or another, but not to
negotiate any further compromise. It is incumbent therefore upon each side
to put forward their most reasonable claim, and one which they believe an
independent third party will favour.
This has the effect of bringing both sides quite close to each other, and
removing the issue of loss of face. I commend it to RMT and Railtrack.
