FOR Peruvians in business nowadays there seems to be but one issue in local
politics: how to avoid 'pendularity'.
This is the local word which refers to the return of the political parties
defeated by Mr Alberto Fujimori in the 1990 elections and then ousted by him
from Congress in his April 1992 coup.
The parties are Accion Popular and Partido Popular Cristiano, on the right;
the Social-democratic Apra party; and an archipelago of leftist parties.
Business interests in Peru fear that any combination of these parties in
power would mean an end to Mr Fujimori's neo-liberal economic policies and
the return of high inflation, subsidies and foreign exchange controls - or
protectionism. There is also the question of whether the parties can provide
political stability, economic efficiency, and the will to fight what will
remain a bloody war against the remnants of Sendero Luminoso's (Shining
Path's) 5,000-strong guerrilla army on the field.
And yet there is a widespread feeling that Mr Fujimori's authoritarian style
of government cannot run for long without increasing strong-arm tactics
(something international pressure presently impedes) or without considerable
doses of popularity (something his economic policies are starting to erode).
The very idea that ex-President Alan Garcia (1985-1990), the exiled leader
of the Apra party, whose administration swamped Peru in hyperinflation,
could once again rule the country, led Peru's businessmen to support Mr
Fujimori's April 1992 coup against Congress.
Sixteen months after the coup Mr Fujimori is still railing against the
politicians, but the message has lost most of its bite.
Unpopular as they now are, the parties and their leaders are proving
resilient. Keeping them at bay in a low intensity democracy such as Mr
Fujimori's is proving unhealthy for the country's political stability.
Preventing pendularity has meant a freer hand for the Peruvian military  -
and, consequently, persistent violations of human rights.
Most opposition leaders, with the exception of Mr Garcia, a staunch critic
of neo-liberal policies, have so far expressed the need to maintain Mr
Fujimore's economic reform programme.
But this has not held them back from giving Mr Fujimori a bumpy political
ride since his coup. The worst of the bumps so far have come from outside
Peru, in the form of international pressure on the subject of human rights.
An attempted coup last November 13 (the first for 18 years) and a good
showing of the parties in the past January's municipal elections have
reminded everyone that the pillars of Mr Fujimori's power - control of the
army and success in the popularity polls - are not quite the democratic
stability he claims for his regime.
Mr Fujimori's contribution to the fight against pendularity is to seek
re-election. First, he needs to win the coming October 31 constitutional
referendum.
His closest backers, especially the actual and potential buyers in the
country's privatisation drive, will not hear about Mr Fujimori leaving his
post in 1995. According to congressman Mr Victor Joy Way, China's Shougang
Corporation (so far, Peru's most important new foreign investor) has pressed
him to run for re-election.
Stability has become identified with Mr Fujimori's permanence. This, of
course, is the classic dictatorial scenario, implying that any pressure for
more democracy inevitably appears to threaten stability.
Because there exists the idea that pendularity may be in the hearts of an
impoverished and expectant population, and that sooner or later the fickle
Peruvian electoral mood will swing away from Mr Fujimori, potential
investors are in a mood of more or less permanent wait-and-see, with more
local and foreign money moving through the brisk Lima stock market than into
its productive ventures.
A recent opinion poll, conducted in Peru's main cities by the Imasen private
research institute, has revealed that employment is the main concern of
about 70 per cent of the population, and that worries about terrorism have
diminished in importance - about 30 per cent of the population remains
anxious.
Mr Fujimori's weak political spot is the economy. The reforms have failed to
produce any trickle-down effect so far, and as fear of a resurgence of
hyperinflation and terrorism recedes, Peruvians are starting to grumble
about falling salaries and rising unemployment.
