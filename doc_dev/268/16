<F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Borisevich under the "Nonpayments and </F>
Family Budget" rubric: "Not Only Is There No Money To Live On, 
There Is None for Funerals Either"] 
  [Text] All through the last few months, Vorkuta has been 
living in a strike regime. The strike at the "Severnaya" pit 
ends, another one begins at the "Komsomolskaya." "Yur-Shor" 
miners come up to the surface, mine constructors refuse to leave 
the coal face. A hunger strike ends in one place and begins in 
another. The center of tension swings like a pendulum. But it 
can be used like a compass to follow who has been given money 
and who has not. Money is usually given after a strike -- 
especially a hunger strike. 
  Money. This is the leash with which the government keeps 
Vorkuta in check, by relaxing or tightening it. But this is for 
the time being. Only recently the miners were demanding only 
money. Now, they are coming out with political slogans. In 
time everything is possible, even including acts of sabotage. 
Threats have already been made. 
  All pits are state-owned. The debtors are, therefore, well 
known. The Russian Government is not allocating subsidies and 
is not setting aside money for the social sphere. Consumers -- 
Cherepovets, Lipetsk, and Moscow -- are not paying for shipped 
coal. There are also factors which are purely Vorkuta's 
miscalculations: unprofitable barter, high cost price, 
financial defects. Pits have no money -- there will not be any 
in the budget either. Therefore, the picture is very confused. 
Sorting it out is as difficult as working out what people who 
have not received wages since last December are living on. 
  While strikes are "paying off" for the miners, after which 
they are paid either an advance of 100,000-200,000 rubles [R] 
each or else their full wage, the situation in the social sphere 
is much worse. The coal sector has on its balance sheet 
two-thirds of Vorkuta's housing, almost 70 kindergartens, and 
other social facilities. All these economic activities require 
R40 billion per month, which should be financed from the Russian 
budget under a separate heading. Since the beginning of the 
year not a penny has gone to Vorkuta under this heading. Mainly 
women work in the social sphere. All well and good if some of 
them have husbands who are miners. The rest are simply doomed. 
  Women's movement activists have recounted how they went 
around visiting families on a holiday. One family had only 
toast on the table, and when the women started treating the 
children to candy the mother's nerves snapped and she became 
hysterical. 
  Announced and unannounced hunger strikes, unemployment, the 
abolition of benefits for medicines for children and pensioners 
-- all this is Vorkuta today. All it needs is a small push and 
an explosion will be inevitable. 
  A school principal relates: "The last time I received money 
was in January. It was R25,000." "How are you surviving?" "At 
first we ate our reserves, now we are eating only groats and we 
have had to sell some things from our home." 
  Here is the testimony of A. Stepanov, chairman of the 
Council 
of Vorkuta Directors: "Not only is there no money to live on, 
there is none for funerals either. We are all hostages." 
  The natural question arises: "How much high-energy Vorkuta 
coal does Russia need? For what quantity of it will Russia 
guarantee payment? Judging by the draft budget, the sector will 
receive one-half of the funds it is demanding. This means that 
the financial reorganization [sanatsiya] of pits is inevitable. 
For example, the program to close the "Khalmer-Yu" pit in 
Vorkuta has now been costed out. Its production capacity is 
410,000 tonnes a year and it has around 2,000 employees. 
Expenditure on closing the pit and social welfare for its 
workers is in excess of R43 billion. This is only for one, 
which is by no means the biggest pit. 
  Both the development of the Pechora coal basin and its 
mothballing are equally heavy burdens for the budget. But 
enough time has already been spent standing at the crossroads.
