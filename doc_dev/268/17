   For all their imagery of Camelot revisited,
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen can't rely entirely on the 1960
electoral playbook written by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
   It is 28 years later _ years in which America has lost a war and
a few presidents, gone through a civil rights revolution, seen the
emergence of a two-party South, and swung with the ideological
pendulum.
   The America that will decide whether to vote for Dukakis-Bentsen
is far different from the one that narrowly chose Kennedy-Johnson,
the earlier Massachusetts and Texas combination.
   ``I don't see that the analogy works, other than it's nice
poetry,'' said Ed Reilly, a New York pollster and adviser to
Democratic candidates.
   But they will be able to use some of the 1960 strategy that
Kennedy used in narrowly defeating Richard Nixon. They've already
begun.
   Kennedy was stunned that Johnson accepted the No. 2 post, since
he had sought the presidential nomination himself. But in his book,
``The Making of the President, 1960,'' Theodore White wrote that
Johnson's selection sealed the plan they would pursue.
   ``The first of the Kennedy strategies had been a regional one,
decided by the candidate alone, on the night of his nomination, by
his choice of a vice president,'' White wrote.
   ``He felt he had New England locked up; that he must campaign
personally for the big Northeastern industrial states; that Lyndon
B. Johnson must be his Lord Constable for the Old South. These
grand calculations worked.''
   In many ways this year, Dukakis' aim is the same. His selection
of Bentsen was an attempt to reclaim Texas, with its 29 electoral
votes. It also was an attempt to appeal to white swing voters in
other Southern states, and to compel Republican George Bush to
invest time and money in Texas and the South.
   ``John Kennedy's selection of Lyndon Johnson as his running mate
turned out to be one of the crucial differences of the election in
1960,'' recalled Ted Sorensen, then a policy adviser to Kennedy,
today a New York attorney and author of the 1988 Democratic
platform draft.
   ``Johnson helped carry Texas and Louisiana ... He helped keep
North Carolina and South Carolina,'' Sorensen said in an interview.
``A vice president is only a small reason, but it is an additional
factor to cause people to vote, to return to their party.''
   Robert Healy, associate editor of the Boston Globe, recalled
covering that 1960 race. Kennedy was facing hostility in the South
and some other areas over his Catholic religion.
   The Thursday before the election, Kennedy campaigned in Oklahoma
City in a futile attempt to hold a state so close to Texas. He was
spit upon by the crowd, Healy recalled.
   ``Johnson had gone in and really met that sort of thing in Texas
for Kennedy,'' he said.
   The Kennedy campaign adopted an electoral strategy that focused
on nine large states, White recounted. In 1960, New York,
Pennsylvania, California, Michigan, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, New
Jersey and Massachusetts together held 237 of the 269 electoral
votes needed to win.
   ``It was in these big states that Kennedy invested the greatest
part of his time and personal effort, while Nixon sought to spread
himself over all 50 states of the Union,'' White wrote.
   ``If those could be swept, and if another 60 or 70 electoral
votes could be added by Lyndon B. Johnson in the Old South, and if
a few more solid New England or Midwestern states could be counted
in, then the election would be won handily,'' White wrote.
   Kennedy carried all but two of those nine: Ohio and California.
He swept New England, the most heavily Catholic and his native
region; much of the South including Texas and some border states;
and the small western states of Nevada and New Mexico.
   His wins in Texas and Illinois were razor thin, and it's often
noted that a shift of 4,500 votes in Illinois and 28,000 in Texas
would have reversed those states, and the election.
   But he won 23 states and 303 electoral votes, more than enough.
   If Dukakis and Bentsen carried each of these same states this
year, they would win, too _ but by a smaller electoral margin.
Shifting populations have reduced the electoral votes of those
states to 286.
   That leaves very little margin of error. Moreover, there are few
safe Democratic states any more, and some of the Kennedy states may
be out of reach to Dukakis.
   On the other hand, Dukakis is considered competitive in parts of
the farm and industrial Middle West, and big states like Ohio and
California, where he will mount a challenge, would make up for a
lot of smaller states.
   The South has seen both the emergence of a strong Republican
Party that has dominated in presidential elections, and the
emergence of a large black vote that is reliably Democratic.
Kennedy won black votes in the South _ indeed became champion to
blacks when he intervened to help get Martin Luther King Jr. out of
a Georgia prison two weeks before the election _ but black voter
registration was low, a fraction of today's.
   There have been other changes too, like the switch to public
financing of campaigns, that make a substantive comparison to 1960
impractical.
   But in the end, if Dukakis gets out of his Bentsen choice what
Kennedy got out of Johnson, it may be all that matters.
   ``If they win Texas, they'll all be geniuses and probably win
the election,'' said Reilly. ``If they lose Texas, they probably
lose the election.''
