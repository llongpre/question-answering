   Sir James Goldsmith's failed takeover of BAT
Industries PLC underscores growing anti-takeover sentiment in the
United States and distaste for American-style megabids in Europe,
experts say.
   The Goldsmith-led investor group, Hoylake Investments Ltd., last
week said it wouldn't renew its hostile $22 billion offer for the
British conglomerate. The move came amid roadblocks to U.S. state
regulatory approval.
   The purchase would have been the world's second-largest takeover
after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s $25 billion acquisition of
RJR Nabisco Inc., completed early last year.
   ``The era of truly giant takeovers may now be consigned with
some confidence to the 1980s,'' the daily economic newspaper the
Financial Times wrote.
   The general demise of the U.S. junk bond market and the guilty
plea last week by junk bond wizard Michael Milken have increased
negative attitudes toward the high-yield, high-risk bonds, and the
takeovers they financed.
   California state insurance regulator two weeks ago blocked a
change of ownership of BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los
Angeles. Hoylake had planned to sell Farmers to the French
insurance company Axa-Midi Assurances.
   The offer also needed the green light from eight other states
where Farmers operates. Hoylake suspended its bid last September
while it sought the clearances.
   The failure illustrates the increasingly complex, international
nature of takeovers, said Joanna Gant, deputy editor of the British
publication Acquisitions Monthly.
   Goldsmith, who built his reputation of taking over and breaking
up American companies, hoped the grass would be greener in Europe.
He was joined by British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and
Australian businessman Kerry Packer.
   ``Certainly the U.S. is becoming more defensive,'' Ms. Gant
said. ``People thought it was the Japanese who they were afraid of,
and now it seems they are afraid of anyone from overseas.''
   That includes the British, with whom Americans traditionally
have had strong ties.
   Norton Co. workers burned a Union Jack on the steps of the
Worcester, Mass., city hall last month to protest a $1.6 billion
takeover bid for the abrasives maker by the British industrial
company BTR PLC.
   Earlier this month, the Massachusetts legislature rushed
approval of a bill designed to bolster Norton's defense by
requiring staggered terms for corporate directors, with only
one-third elected each year. That makes it almost impossible for a
raider to gain board control quickly.
   Norton last week accepted a friendly $1.8 billion offer from the
French glass maker Compagnie Saint-Gobain.
   The U.S. barriers are raising alarms in Britain, whose companies
are big buyers of American businesses.
   ``It would be tempting to dismiss state anti-takeover laws as
just a fit of temporary madness,'' The Economist magazine wrote.
But they represent ``a growing contempt for shareholders, combined
with a revolt against all forms of takeover,'' it said.
   Jonathan Mervis, chief executive of J.P. Mervis and Co. Ltd., a
London-based acquisitions adviser, said: ``Anti-takeover measures
give incumbent management the right to run the business without
really being answerable to anyone, to their shareholders.
   ``That will cause the pendulum the swing the other way,'' he
said.
   The Hoylake offer had appeared unlikely to succeed, even without
U.S. obstacles. In the end, it only garnered between 1 percent and
2 percent of BAT's stock.
   Critics objected to the highly leveraged nature of the bid,
which was to have been 80 percent debt-financed. Hoylake belatedly
said it might include some cash in the offer.
   A probable factor in Goldsmith's failure was the collapse of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the junk bond investment firm that
Hoylake had hired to help line up its financing.
   Another factor was BAT's quick response to the bid. It launched
a major restructuring, selling and spinning off its retailing and
paper businesses to concentrate on tobacco and financial services.
   The plan, which also involves BAT buying up to 10 percent of its
own stock and increasing dividends, was designed to enhance value
to shareholders.
   Goldsmith and other BAT critics had complained that BAT's shares
did not reflect the true value of the company because they were
dragged down by the relatively slow growth of its tobacco
operations. Goldsmith had proposed ``unbundling'' BAT by selling
off its non-tobacco businesses.
