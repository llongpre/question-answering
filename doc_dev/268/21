   A watch traded by a famished American
prisoner of war for a piece of bread near the end of World War II
has found its way back to the soldier's widow.
   Thomas Willis Pitts, who was captured during the Battle of the
Bulge in December 1944, gave his watch to a fellow prisoner for the
bread at a compound at Muhlberg, Germany.
   After the war, Pitts returned to his job with the Internal
Revenue Service, where he worked until retirement in 1976. He died
in June.
   After her husband's death, Esther Pitts joined the 106th
Infantry Division Association Inc., composed of men who had
belonged to the division and their wives. One day while looking
through the organization's magazine, she saw this notice from
Theodore William Young of Ozark, Ala.
   ``Anybody out there who traded a watch for bread in 1945? ... I
had a piece of bread ... when some GI came over to me and said,
`I'll give you this watch for your bread.' I still have the watch
(and) would like to return it.''
   ``When I saw the ad, I got cold all over,'' Mrs. Pitts said. ``I
said, `That's got to be Willis'.'''
   She wrote Young and described the watch. They agreed it had been
her husband's.
   Young said he kept the watch in an old matchbox for the rest of
the war. When he returned home, then in Columbus, Ohio, Young gave
the timepiece to his father-in-law.
   About four years ago, the father-in-law returned the watch to
Young.
   The watch, still keeping time, was delivered to Mrs. Pitts' home
Monday.
