   Iraq is building a $45 million clock in
Baghdad, featuring gold-plated hands and a 141-foot pendulum, the
Iraqi News Agency reported Thursday.
   The 167-foot clock tower is rising in the Harithiya district,
overlooking the highway connecting downtown Baghdad with the
international airport, the official news agency said.
   At the base of the tower will be a museum, shopping mall,
restaurants and conference halls, the report said. The ground floor
of the building will be reserved for statues depicting major events
in the ``heroic life'' of President Saddam Hussein, starting with
his birth, it added.
   Surrounding the building will be 23 water fountains, lawns and
rose gardens covering an area of 15 square miles.
   The clock will have hands coated in gold donated to the
government by ``the brave Iraqi women'' during the eight-year war
with Iran, the news agency said.
   In memory of the war dead, a crystal ball ``filled with samples
of the weapons used by our martyrs in defense of their homeland''
will be attached to the end of the pendulum, said the report,
monitored in Nicosia.
