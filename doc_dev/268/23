THE FIRST no-strike agree-ment in the National Health Service was signed
yesterday by several unions and Homewood Trust, one of the first wave of new
hospital and community services trusts, Lisa Wood writes.
The agreement with three unions, the Royal College of Nursing and the
British Medical Association introduces a joint commitment to binding
pendulum arbitration in the event of a failure to agree. This is a system in
which an arbitrator accepts either side's final offer. The deal also
introduces procedures to exclude strikes.
Homewood employs 1,000 staff in mental health and services for handicapped
people in north-west Surrey.
Mr Steven Weeks, a senior researcher at the Cohse health service union, said
the arrangement might spread to other trusts, although Cohsewas yet to be
convinced of the merits of binding pendulum arbitration.
The union's view is that the agreement is not technically a no-strike deal,
but the effect will be to make strikes extremely unlikely.
The agreement is one of several radical new arrangements over pay and
conditions being introduced by the new NHS trusts. For staff recruited since
the trusts were established the trusts are able to opt out of nationally
agreed Whitley terms and conditions for staff as well as pay-review
settlements.
