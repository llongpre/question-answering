Iraq is building a $45-million clock in Baghdad, featuring gold-plated hands 
and a 141-foot pendulum, the Iraqi News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 167-foot clock tower is rising in the Harithiya district, overlooking the 
highway connecting downtown Baghdad with the international airport, the 
official news agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of the tower will be a museum, shopping mall, restaurants and 
conference halls, the report said. The ground floor of the building will be 
reserved for statues depicting major events in the "heroic life" of President 
Saddam Hussein, starting with his birth, it added. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the building will be 23 water fountains, lawns and rose gardens 
covering an area of 15 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
The clock will have hands coated in gold donated to the government by "the 
brave Iraqi women" during the eight-year war with Iran, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
In memory of the war dead, a crystal ball "filled with samples of the weapons 
used by our martyrs in defense of their homeland" will be attached to the end 
of the pendulum, the report said.
