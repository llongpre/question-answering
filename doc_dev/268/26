<TEXT>     The court has swung sharply to the right in recent years. The 1986 judicial
retention election that swept Chief Justice Rose Bird and Associate Justices
Cruz Reynoso and Joseph Grodin from the court left Justice Broussard the sole
remaining liberal. (Justice Stanley Mosk is sometimes said to be a liberal,
but he's actually a moderate. );    The three openings were filled by Gov.
George Deukmejian, giving him five appointees on the seven-seat court. The
conservative Iron Duke pushed California's courts to the right by appointing a
disproportionate number of criminal prosecutors of strongly conservative
persuasion. His Supreme Court appointments were equally conservative.;    An
all-conservative court is a problem. When courts move too far out on the
political spectrum, the people lose confidence that the judiciary represents
them. They begin to doubt that the justice system really does justice to their
interests.;    The ideal court is "judicial" rather than ideological. It
sympathizes with both sides of legal controversies, recognizes the validity of
the interests of all parties, and seeks to accommodate those interests in a
way that does justice to both positions rather than merely favoring one side
in a reflex manner. A one-sided, conservative court risks losing this ideal
judicial quality.;    Moreover, justice is best served by a dialogue between
opposing viewpoints rather than a monologue. An all-conservative panel may not
perceive the merit in the claims of the poor and the weak. The court needs
moderates to articulate alternative arguments, it needs to hear another voice
to offset the tendency to adopt oversimplified ideological views.;   
Californians wanted a more conservative court, and got it. But now the
pendulum threatens to swing too far to the right.;    Californians wanted
law-and-order justices to wage the wars on crime and drugs. But the big guns
have begun to backfire. In the last decade, inmates in state prisons have
doubled. A recent New York Times article states that Vacaville may now be the
largest prison in the world. Despite billions of dollars invested, we can't
keep up. Prisons are rat holes, graduate schools of crime.;    Even Chief
Justice Malcolm Lucas admits that the courts are jammed with drug cases,
unable to conduct civil trials. And still the crime rate rises. We have gone
too far. We need justices who can offer new perspectives.;    Californians
wanted justices more sympathetic to business, less likely to impose stringent
requirements to protect consumers and the environment. But deregulation led
not to the greatest good for the greatest numbers, but to the excesses of the
1980s, the leveraging of American industry, junk bonds, business failures,
recession. We need justices who will not roll over to business interests,
justices who have economic balance.;    Justice Broussard's resignation also
leaves the court without a black representative. Justice Kennard is Asian, but
the other justices are white males. The California melting pot needs leaders
who sympathize with the needs of minorities.;    The trend on the California
high court is like that of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Rehnquist court has
only one liberal, Thurgood Marshall, its only minority justice.;    California
now has the chance to create a model for the nation. Governor Wilson should
grasp this opportunity for statesmanship by appointing a proven moderate,
preferably a minority, who can balance the Supreme Court, keep a healthy
dialogue alive and ensure that the court carries out its proper role as
defender of constitutional liberty and economic justice.  </TEXT>
