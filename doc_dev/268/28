<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE: The Supreme Court's nine members are among the most
private of public officials. They wield enormous power but rarely
hold news conferences or give interviews. A recent poll indicated
only one in three Americans can name any of the nine. This, the
ninth and last in a series, offers an up-to-date look at one member
of the nation's highest court.</HEAD>

   Justice Harry A. Blackmun says he is one of the
Supreme Court's ``three old goats'' whose inevitable departure will
solidify conservative domination of the court for the next 40 or 50
years.
   Labeled a conservative when he joined the court two decades ago,
Blackmun now is an outspoken critic of the court's rightward shift.
He demonstrated his candor during an interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``Last year the cluster of five (conservative members) emerged,
and certainly this year they have control of the court completely,
and are making the most of it,'' Blackmun said.
   He listed Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron
R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy
as members of the court's conservative majority.
   ``I had a feeling until last year that, while they could have had
control of the court, they didn't really seize it,'' the 81-year-old
justice said.
   ``I suppose as long as I am not a member of that group it is
difficult. But we shouldn't resent it,'' he said. ``That's the way
the system works. That pendulum swings. It will stay this way now 40
or 50 years, I'm sure.''
   Blackmun, who Saturday marked his 20th anniversary as a justice,
predicts the court will grow more conservative after the departure
of its three octogenarians _ himself and Justices William J.
Brennan, 84, and Thurgood Marshall, 81.
   None of the three has indicated he is considering retirement.
   Brennan and Marshall are the court's most liberal members, often
joined in the most divisive cases by Blackmun and Justice John Paul
Stevens, 70.
   ``Time will take its toll on the three old goats,'' Blackmun
said. ``We will be replaced by appointees of the current
administration or the next one, which is probably going to be
another Bush administration. So it seems to me that before too long
the court could be nine conservatives, and that surely will last
well into the next century.''
   When appointed by President Nixon, Blackmun had the reputation of
a politically and judicially conservative federal appeals court
judge from Minnesota.
   Early in his high court tenure, he was ridiculed for his
perceived dependence on then-Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, an old
friend. Even after Blackmun wrote the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion he was considered a dependable
conservative vote.
   By 1980, however, he had emerged as an independent force on the
court. In the past decade, he increasingly sided with the liberal
wing.
   ``I don't believe I've changed in fundamental outlook,'' Blackmun
said. ``If one goes back and reads my opinions on the court of
appeals, you'll find that they are not rock-ribbed conservatism of
the type that seems to be popular today.''
   As a lower court judge, Blackmun said he and his colleagues
``always had the comfort of knowing that if we're wrong, those nine
jokers down in Washington will straighten us out. Here, it's the end
of the line. When one gets here, he has to develop an in-depth
judicial philosophy.''
   He added: ``One has to develop his attitude toward the
(Constitution's) great phrases. What does `equal protection' mean?
What is `cruel and unusual punishment'? I would hope that I have
grown in that respect over the years. But as far as shifting from
conservatism to liberalism, I don't believe I have done that.''
   On the bench, Blackmun most often displays a judicial scowl and
can be snappish with lawyers. Off the bench, warmth and humor
emerge. The justice turns downright effusive when discussing his
three daughters and grandchildren or swapping baseball gossip.
   He is less willing to discuss the possibility of retirement.
   ``I think one has to have good health in this job. I don't
believe one can keep up without it, and I am very conscious of the
fact that some former colleagues of mine who were my age are long
gone,'' Blackmun said.
   After noting that he undergoes a complete physical exam at the
Mayo Clinic each year, Blackmun smiled and said, ``There are two or
three out there who promise they will let me know when my level of
senility reaches the unacceptable point.''
   Blackmun has suffered from recurring cancer of the prostate
gland. Most recently, he was treated for it in 1987. No further
problems have been reported.
   Blackmun realizes his role in court history will be defined
largely by his writing the Roe vs. Wade decision. ``Author of the
abortion decision,'' he once said. ``We all pick up tags. I'll carry
this one to my grave.''
   He has remained an ardent defender of a woman's right to end her
pregnancy and last year dissented bitterly from a decision that gave
states more power to regulate abortion.
   But Blackmun said he hopes other aspects of his tenure will not
be eclipsed. ``I hope I would be remembered as a person of judicial
integrity who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one
field,'' he told the AP.
   ``I'd like to be known just as a good worker in the vineyard who
held his own and contributed generally to the advancement of the
law.''
