   Break a tooth on a bony chicken "filet" sandwich and the law in many states requires you to grin and bear it. 

   But a California Supreme Court ruling last week offers consumers some hope. 

   The court has cleared the way for a lawsuit by Patrice Evart, a Los Angeles stockbroker who says she broke a tooth after biting down on a bone in a hamburger at Donna Lee's Fish &amp; Chips in Granada Hills, Calif., three years ago. 

   Consumers can already seek redress for nails, glass and other "foreign objects," but the law has long viewed chicken bones in pot pies and pits in cherry tarts as part of the give and take of daily life. 

   New York, for example, ruled against a plaintiff who found a prune pit in a jar of prune butter. 
And North Carolina denied relief to a person who bit into a crystallized grain of corn in corn flakes. 

   In California, the legal precedent dates back to a 1936 state Supreme Court decision against a person who swallowed a chicken bone in a pot pie. 
The court reasoned that it was "common knowledge chicken pies occasionally contain chicken bones." 

   When Ms. Evart sued about the bone in her hamburger, the case was dismissed by a trial judge, based on the 1936 case. 
But last June, a California appeals court reversed the judge's ruling. 
It held that a piece of bone in supposedly finely ground beef isn't something most consumers necessarily anticipate. 
It also observed that consumers would have difficulty protecting themselves "short of removing the hamburger from its bun, breaking it apart and inspecting its small components." 

   The California Supreme Court agreed. 

   Now, Ms. Evart and her attorney, Michael Kushner, have a chance to try to convince a jury that she deserves $35,000 in damages. 
"The food industry has been thumbing its nose at people for the last half century," says Mr. Kushner. 
The new ruling, he says, finally offers injured citizens the prospect of relief. 

   But the National Food Processors Association and others warn of a "tremendous and unwarranted" increase in food-related litigation. 

   "This is going to have the trial lawyers in the state of California smacking their lips," says Linda Bulmash, a lawyer for Tip Top Meats &amp; Deli, the Los Angeles meat processor whose beef allegedly started the whole thing.
