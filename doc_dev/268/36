<LEADPARA>  For many Soviets, elation about the collapse of communism in their country is
mingled with real fear about the future.;   These observations come from
Vladimir Verbitski, a researcher with a medical publishing house. They are
part of an ongoing correspondence between the Mercury News and Soviets through
electronic mail.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>    "The political situation in this country is changing so rapidly that I feel
dizzy. Last Monday morning (Aug. 19) I drove downtown to my office . . . with
tanks moving in the same direction. On Friday morning not only tanks but the
whole huge monument to Iron Felix -- Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of KGB --
had already disappeared from the square in the center of Moscow which the KGB
building is facing. Today I saw groups of people around the monument to Lenin.
. . .;   "You know, Gorbachev was never as popular in the USSR as he was
abroad. He almost always looked arrogant or annoyed, always liked to teach
people. Today for the first time I saw tears in his eyes and soft human
expression on his face.;   Persecutions a problem; "Now, many public leaders
warn against possible persecutions of rank-and-file members of the Communist
Party. This is really a problem. The CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet
Union) in fact was never a political party in a literal meaning of this term.
It was a part of a society and a part of state power. Millions of party
members were far from real politics. In the majority, they were decent people.
To be admitted to the party was an honor. . . .;   "Contrary to them, real
(professional) party functionaries are in the majority amoral people and in
fact mafiosi. But real life is complicated. Boris Yeltsin, for instance, our
national hero, whom we are now proud of, all his life before recent years had
worked in (Communist) party structures. . . .;   Converting Philistines; "One
of the main tendencies is that our people seem to be changing from Philistines
to citizens. We hope that their active position will at last civilize our
life, which is rather hard now. There are shortages in everything. One can't
buy a pair of socks or a piece of cheese in Moscow. Average monthly wage in
Moscow is about 500 rubles or less. Very bad men's suit costs approximately
1,000 rubles, and it's a problem to find it in stock. A kitchen refrigerator
costs several thousand rubles. Two pounds of pork may cost up to 40 rubles,
and so forth.;   Pendulum could reverse; If the new government doesn't find a
way to raise the quality of life to the minimal acceptable level, the pendulum
of social spirits may easily lurch in the opposite direction. I am convinced
that the only way out is privatization of everything that can be privatized,
strong laws in defense of private property and opening doors for investments
from abroad.  </TEXT>
