<P>
It was a glorious Indian summer day in Manhattan, the kind that Umberto Eco 
ordinarily might spend roaming the city streets and drinking in the sights and 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
But these are not ordinary times for the portly, bearded university 
professor-turned-novelist, who created a literary sensation almost a decade ago 
with the publication of his first fictional work, "The Name of the Rose." 
</P>
<P>
His long-awaited second novel, "Foucault's Pendulum," has just been released in 
an English-language version by his American publishers, Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich, and his schedule overflows with the usual rounds of interviews, 
book signings, lectures, readings and receptions to promote the book. 
</P>
<P>
"My only pleasure is to obey my publicist," he said with a sigh during an 
interview in the sun-filled tearoom of the elegant Fifth Avenue hotel where he 
was staying. "It is a pity, because I am a compulsive walker." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the amiable expression on his face seemed to say, that it is a small 
sacrifice for the adulation he and his new novel are receiving. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, where the book came out last year, it sold more than 600,000 copies 
in the first three months of release and launched a new wave of "Ecomania." At 
one point, it was outselling its closest rival on the Top 10 list by about 100 
to 1. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, in the space of three short weeks, it has already climbed to 
the top ranking in the Washington area and holds the No. 3 spots on the Los 
Angeles Times and New York Times best-seller lists. His book signings have been 
mobbed by eager fans, and his readings, lectures and debates have played to 
packed houses. In addition, his American publishers are printing 25,000 more 
copies of the book to augment the initial run of 250,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Along with its commercial success, the book has been greeted by overwhelming 
critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
No one, of course, is more pleased at all this than the 57-year-old Eco, who, 
until the publication of "The Name of the Rose" in 1980, was little known 
outside of academic circles in his chosen field of semiotics, the study of 
symbols and signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Every author has two dreams," said Eco, who speaks fluent English with a 
lilting Italian accent. "One is to sell a lot of copies. The other is to have 
written such an important book that it is difficult to read. But to have both. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
There is no denying that his latest book is difficult to read -- in many ways, 
perhaps even more so than "The Name of the Rose." 
</P>
<P>
For starters, it is 641 pages long -- almost 1 1/3 times as long as "The Name 
of the Rose." What is more, it has a far more convoluted structure and ranges 
in subject matter over what at times seems like the whole of Western culture, 
from Jewish cabala, the medieval Knights Templars, Shakespeare and Celtic 
legend to Karl Marx, Afro-Brazilian voodoo, computer theory and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
But in much the same way that he wrapped the medieval theological disputes and 
disquisitions in "The Name of the Rose" around a good old-fashioned murder 
mystery to hold the reader's interest, so he has plotted "Foucault's Pendulum" 
around a compelling adventure mystery. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, his presentation of the often arcane and abstruse history in the 
book is seldom dull or unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in describing the rise of the Knights Templars, a militant 
religious order established among the Crusaders in the early 12th Century, 
Casaubon, the narrator and one of the chief characters of the book, says: 
"Remember, the new kingdom of Jerusalem was sort of the California of the day, 
the place you went to make your fortune. Prospects at home were not great, and 
some of the knights may have been on the run for one reason or another. I think 
of it as a kind of Foreign Legion." 
</P>
<P>
Eco says the fascination his books hold, despite the difficulties they pose for 
readers, is easily explained. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many books that are adventures, in which someone is going through a 
forest, in which a lot of strange trees with exotic names are mentioned," he 
said. "You may not know the names or the shapes of the trees. But you continue 
reading because you participate in a sort of an agreement with the author. Now 
suppose that, instead of using nature, the author uses culture, as I do. The 
effect is the same." 
</P>
<P>
"Foucault's Pendulum," eight years in the writing, is the story of three 
editors at an obscure publishing house in Milan who get caught up in a hoax of 
their own making involving a supposed Knights Templars plan to tap a mystic 
source of power greater than any other known on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, they are hoist by their own petard -- in the case of one character, 
almost literally so. 
</P>
<P>
Eco says the book is a cautionary tale against a problem that has plagued 
mankind for centuries: the all-too-human passion for concocting some grand 
scheme -- usually conspiratorial in nature -- then, finding hidden meanings in 
the least little things to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Eco says, such intellectual machinations are relatively harmless 
-- like the 19th-Century literary tracts that sought to prove, through their 
eccentric interpretations of "The Divine Comedy," that Dante was a Rosicrucian, 
even though he lived hundreds of years before the mystic order's founding. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, however, the results of this "plotomania," as Eco calls it, can 
have disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
He gives as an example the so-called Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a 
fabrication of anti-Semitic czarist Russians alleging a Jewish plot for world 
conquest that the Nazis used to help justify their systematic extermination of 
European Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The Protocols are a classic example of a concoction born of pure paranoia," 
Eco said. "They are a pure comic text, full of contradictions. You can't take 
them seriously." But this, he added, does not stop anti-Semites from continuing 
to accept them as Gospel truth -- or some close approximation of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Take the attitude of one Nesta Webster, a reactionary, anti-Semitic 
Englishwoman," he said. "She was mad but not stupid. She recognizes that the 
Protocols cannot be authentic. But, she says, that doesn't matter because they 
say exactly what the Jews think. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fundamentally fascist, this way of looking at things and continuously 
finding connections. Why are you wearing a red tie?" he asked, his gravelly 
voice taking a suddenly peremptory tone as he noted an interviewer's bright 
crimson knitted tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Were you a premature anti-fascist of the times of McCarthy? Are you a secret 
Communist? . . . You see what I mean? You can do anything once you start down 
that path of reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
In "Foucault's Pendulum," the three plotomaniac editors are started down the 
path when approached by Col. Ardenti, a former Foreign Legionnaire who sports 
an Adolphe Menjou mustache. He starts the ball rolling by telling them he has 
discovered a centuries-old coded message involving the supposed Knights 
Templars plan to harness the mystic power source. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, the colonel disappears and is presumed to have been 
murdered. From then on, the story spins out in an ever-growing web of intrigue, 
deception and intellectual excess that eventually snares the editors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Eco says that the moral of the story is contained in every chapter in 
one way or another, it never seems more directly and eloquently stated than 
when Casaubon, the story's narrator, says: "I have come to believe that the 
whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own 
mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Eco did not know whether he had another novel in him after he had 
completed "The Name of the Rose," which has gone on to sell more than 9 million 
copies in 24 languages in hard- and soft-cover editions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to start writing from some personal obsession," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The obsession, in the case of "Foucault's Pendulum," came in the form of two 
images with which he had long been fascinated. 
</P>
<P>
One was the pendulum designed by the 19th-Century French physicist Jean 
Bernard-Leon Foucault to demonstrate the Earth's rotation. Eco first saw one of 
the devices 25 to 30 years ago hanging in a Paris museum, the Conservatoire des 
Arts et Metiers. 
</P>
<P>
The other image was of a scene out of his childhood in Italy during World War 
II, when he played the trumpet at a burial ceremony in a country village for 
some anti-fascist partisans. 
</P>
<P>
"I started thinking about what could be in between those two images in a book," 
Eco said. "One year later, I started finding out." 
</P>
<P>
How precisely he fitted everything between those two images is evident in the 
book. The opening chapter finds Casaubon gazing upon Foucault's pendulum as he 
hides out in the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers. The penultimate chapter is 
a haunting lyrical one based on Eco's trumpet-playing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that cemetery story," Eco said with a wistful look in his dark eyes. "I 
have told it a lot to my friends over the years. Also, to many women to seduce 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has had several offers, Eco said that he has no intentions of 
allowing the book to be made into a movie because of what he describes as the 
risk to the novelist. 
</P>
<P>
"When the book is like 'Death in Venice' and the movie arrives 40 years later, 
there is enough distance from the book so that people won't make a comparison 
between the two," he explained. "But when the movie arrives too early on the 
shoulders of the book, there will be too many people who read the book through 
the movie, and this betrays the book." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added with a smile, "I don't think it's possible to make a movie 
out of 'Foucault's Pendulum' -- except to make a sort of Vincent Price movie." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, too -- although he prefers not to discuss it -- his experience in 
seeing "The Name of the Rose" translated to film has soured him on having 
"Foucault's Pendulum" turned into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, for a book written as a caution against making unwarranted 
connections, "Foucault's Pendulum" has stimulated many a reader to try his own. 
</P>
<P>
Eco said that he is often questioned about the possible significance of the 
fact that the last names of the three editors start with the initial letters B, 
C and D -- Belbo, Casaubon and Diotallevi -- and that they are furthered in 
their scheme by three characters whose names each begin with the letter A -- 
Col. Ardenti, Signor Aglie and a computer dubbed Abulafia after a Jewish 
cabalist. 
</P>
<P>
"And another person has noted that Jacopo Belbo drinks a lot and that his 
initials are the same as a popular whiskey, J &amp; B," Eco said, dismissing 
such speculation as nonsense with a wave of his hand. "Once you start, as I 
said, you never can stop." 
</P>
<P>
However, he does not deny that there may have been some unconscious intent of 
which he was and remains totally unaware. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine once asked me why I chose the name Amparo for the Brazilian 
woman Casaubon has an affair with," he recalled. "'He said it was pretty 
strange because it's a Spanish name and not Brazilian -- a fact I note in the 
novel. He asked me if I had known someone named Amparo." 
</P>
<P>
Eco told the friend that he had once had an affair with a Latin American woman 
who served as the model for his fictional creation. But she was not Brazilian 
and her name was not Amparo. Only later, however, did he recall that when he 
was writing the scenes between Casaubon and Amparo, he would think of his old 
Latin American flame and how she used to played "Guantanamera" for him on her 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I remembered in one of the lines of that song there is a reference to 
a mountain called Amparo," he said. "So probably from my guts it came up in my 
writing. Did I have any conscious intent? No." 
</P>
<P>
Success as a novelist has not changed Eco much, although he finds celebrity 
consumes a lot of precious time that he would rather devote to writing and to 
his scholarly pursuits. He still teaches classes at the University of Bologna. 
</P>
<P>
But there are compensations -- like seeing his first book, "The Aesthetics of 
Aquinas," which was based on his doctoral dissertation, printed recently in an 
English-language version by Harvard University Press. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely true that I am happier of those 2,000 copies of the Harvard 
University Press than the millions of 'The Name of the Rose,' " he said. "It 
was the only one of my books that had never been translated because it was 
difficult. Even in Italy, the first edition was a small university press run of 
about 500 copies." 
</P>
<P>
Is there another novel in the works? 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible," he said. "One reason I started the second was to separate 
myself from the first. Otherwise, you become a prisoner to the book. It's 
possible that, at a certain point, if I feel too pressured by the 'Pendulum,' I 
will be obliged to start thinking about another story."
