<LEADPARA>  CAROL Burnett has lined up Martin Short as a guest on the debut segment of her
CBS variety show that unveils in November.;   She hopes to have Tim Conway,
Vicki Lawrence and Harvey Korman -- sidekicks from her former variety show --
join her from time to time on the new hour-long offering but is currently
holding auditions for a weekly ensemble group. She expects to hire six to
eight new regulars for the 1991 edition of "The Carol Burnett Show."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's going to be fascinating to see how Burnett's latest TV variety show
fares. Though there hasn't been a variety show that's succeeded in many years,
she doesn't buy the notion that the form is passe. "It's just a matter of how
the pendulum swings -- being in the right place at the right time. I do know
variety will certainly be coming back -- it's just a matter of when.";   The
way she figures it, she can't lose with her move away from the half-hour NBC
anthology series she found extremely hard to put together each week.;   She
says of the upcoming CBS offering, "If it works, it'll be such fun being back
in the sandbox, doing what I love most. And if it doesn't work, well, I'll at
least have 13 weeks of fun, and then I'll go on to other things.";   TOO MUCH
TO HANDLE: Donna Mills, who plays Joyce Lukezic (who spent three years in
prison for a crime she didn't commit) in ABC's upcoming fact-based "False
Arrest" miniseries, says having Lukezic on the set made filming very
difficult. "It made me a little crazy when the producers wanted to have her in
the jury box in one scene. I said 'No, no, how can I be there playing someone
on trial for my life, when I'm looking at the person I'm supposed to be
playing?' " Mills says after she balked, "Lukezic was put in the audience, but
even she found it difficult being in the scene and ended up leaving the
courtroom." Mills says her character spends "almost the entire second two
hours of the miniseries in prison, where she was beaten up and raped. It was
very depressing, and by the end I was emotionally wrung out.";   INSIDE TRACK:
Songstress Deniece Williams reveals that 4-month-old son Logan was the
inspiration for "Lullabies to Dreamland," her new Word/MCA children's album.
"Every night I'd sing him to sleep with this little song I made up to 'Brahms'
Lullaby,' and my husband said, 'You really have a lot of fun with that; you
should consider a children's album."' Williams' "Lullabies" disk features nine
new children's songs she wrote and a musical version of the child's prayer
"Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep.";   Before she heads back into the studio in
November to work on her next album -- which will be "urban with a pop slant"
-- Williams expects to have her own line of maternity clothes in stores. "When
I was pregnant I could never find anything fun to wear that wasn't very
expensive. So I designed my own things, and now I'm going to mass-market the
line."  </TEXT>
