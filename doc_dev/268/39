MSF, THE general technical union, has signed a single-union, no-strike deal
with the Japanese company Toray Textiles Europe. The union once denounced
Japanese company councils and no-strike agreements as 'alien practices'.
Toray Textiles will soon open its third British plant at a greenfield site
in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, employing about 400 people.
MSF, the 600,000-strong union representing mainly white-collar and
professional staff, beat the GMB general union and Knitwear Workers Union to
secure the deal. It is the first it has signed for blue-collar workers.
The agreement includes a classic Japanese-style no-strike deal under which
failure to agree on pay or conditions will lead to external conciliation. If
unresolved, the dispute leads to 'pendulum arbitration' at Acas, the
conciliation service. Pendulum arbitration means the proposal of one side
must be chosen, but no compromise can be accepted.
Mr Roger Lyons, MSF general secretary, distanced himself yesterday from
comments made by his predecessor, Mr Ken Gill, at last year's TUC Congress
attacking Japanese company councils. 'I'm not going to be held accountable
for statements made in a personal capacity by my predecessor,' he said.
He emphasised that 'things are moving on' in other areas of union policy,
rejecting claims that MSF, along with other unions, was behaving
hypocritically over no-strike deals. He stressed that, unlike many such
deals, Toray is allowing the participation of full-time union officials on
the company council and union involvement in training.
The EETPU - the electrical section of the AEEU craft union, which was
criticised by other unions when it pioneered deals like the Toray one in the
early 1980s - took satisfaction from yesterday's announcement.
Mr Paul Gallagher, the electricians' leader, said: 'I'm surprised but
delighted that MSF have stopped seeing inward investors as 'aliens', which
was their previous policy.'
The return to the TUC of the electricians' section of the AEEU craft union
will probably be eased by the likely withdrawal of the non-TUC journalists'
union, the Institute of Journalists, from the Federation of Professional
Associations, run by the electricians section of the AEEU. The TUC
journalists' union, the National Union of Journalists, has been leading the
fight to keep the electricians out of the TUC because of its link with the
IOJ.
