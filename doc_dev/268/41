WRITTEN ON THE BODY by Jeanette Winterson Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 190
pages
YOUNG people who want to write for a living no longer starve in garrets, but
they can still have a pretty rough time until the money starts to roll in
from the books and the TV-scripts - if ever it does.
Take the case of Jeanette Winterson. In 1983 she was 24 and down from
Oxford, with a first novel inside her bursting to get out. Its title was
from a saying of Nell Gwynn's, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.
Winterson's circumstances while writing it were distinctly straitened, as
she explains: 'At that time, I was sharing two rooms and a hip bath with the
actress Vicky Licorish. She had no money, I had no money. We could not
afford the luxury of a separate whites wash and so were thankful of the
fashion for coloured knickers, which allowed those garments most closely
associated with our self-esteem not to be grey'.
Just that one brief quotation makes it abundantly clear that we are dealing
with a Writer; someone whose printed words contain the magic that turns them
into a voice talking to you, forcing you to continue reading the book.
Winterson's singular talent was first recognised in the publishing world by
a woman editor at the newly formed Pandora Press, who accepted the novel but
published it only in a paperback edition.
Winterson explains: 'It went unnoticed, except in the most banal way, by
most reviewers and started to sell at an alarming rate. Small bookshops and
word of mouth were the foundations of my career. . .'
The debutante novelist had two trump cards which she played skilfully. She
was Lancashire working class and had been brought up in an eccentric
denomination of the Christian faith, the Pentecostal Evangelists.
The latter fate - an off-beat spiritual up-bringing - makes for a strenuous
childhood but it does in recollection provide wonderful copy for a writer,
as was shown by Edmund Gosse who was raised in the even sterner creed of the
Plymouth Brethren. His account was called Father and Son. Winterson's might
just as easily have been called 'Mother and Daughter.' Oranges went on to
win the Whitbread prize for a first novel and was made into an award-winning
television drama.
Then in 1987 came The Passion, which won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize, and
in 1989 Sexing the Cherry (both available at Pounds 9.95 in the attractive
new hardback Bloomsbury Classics).
By then Winterson had, through her writing, become a totem for the
alternative society. Its high priest across the water, Gore Vidal, gave her
his accolade by describing her as 'the most interesting writer I have read
in 20 years.' Now, Winterson has come up with Written on the Body, involving
a change of publisher from Bloomsbury to Cape and expectations from the
fiction-reading public, whipped up by the publicists, at their highest. The
novel has been heralded by a flurry of interviews, from which we gather that
the hip bath has gone for good and the former female companion has also been
replaced.
Meanwhile, the critical pendulum has started ominously to swing against
Winterson. Reviews have begun to appear by those impatient to knock the
book; some of them were not even prepared to wait for it to be published
officially before putting in the boot. Clearly, those reviewers who failed
to praise Winterson when it was fashionable to do so are not going to let
themselves be caught out a second time, now that it is becoming fashionable
to denigrate her.
And yet, Written on the Body is no better and no worse than any of the
previous novels. It has exactly the same intimacy of manner, the same quota
of brilliant one-liners, the same digressive tendency leading the writer to
indulge in whimsical reminiscence to the detriment of her plot; and it
explores that same high plateau of passion in which the lover seems to be in
love not so much with another person as with the condition of being in love.
She (or maybe he - one assumes, rashly, the first-person narrator is a she
although that is never actually stated) is determined to preserve this bliss
for ever in all its white-hot incandescence.
In the novels after Oranges, the writer put on the mask of some humble
historical figure - Napoleon's under-chef in the Grand Army, the assistant
gardener to John Tradescant during the Civil War period - to demonstrate
such passion as an element in a wider cataclysm. The vulnerability of the
leading women characters was compensated for by giving them some grotesque
physical abnormality from which they drew strength - huge girth, webbed feet
(see Angela Carter's winged heroine, Fevvers, the model for this particular
feminist strategy).
It is all here again but, this time, made contemporary. The male ogre who
stands for the stultifying imprisonment of a conventional affluent marriage
is a Jewish doctor, a cancer specialist from north London's Stamford Hill.
The hero/heroine - the I - who finds an ultimate love object in his wife is
a translator. The affair, involving the ditching of a previous girlfriend,
is described with dithyrambic Wintersonian intensity that is often quite
hard to take.
Such a passion in Winterson's world is never transformed by the process of
procreation, its natural and usual culmination, so what may alter or
frustrate it? The answer, here, is the onset of cancer, portending the death
of the love object.
Leukaemia afflicts the doctor's wife, who returns to him. That leads
Winterson to some high definition writing on the inroads the disease makes
on the body, and also to an extended description of the agony it imposes on
the mind of the sufferer's beloved partner. This is a very real human
problem, one not exclusive to the experience of either gender. It is studied
at the end of this short novel with poignant realism.
