As he prepares to step down as president of the International Assn. of 
Machinists this month, William Winpisinger is confident that organized labor 
has a bright future. But he says he's worried that union leaders will revert to 
their old ways when the pendulum of power swings back in labor's direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe we're seeing the funeral mass being said over us. I can't 
even hear the strains of the organ dirge," says the outspoken union leader who 
retires after 38 years in the labor movement. "As long as people work, sooner 
or later, no matter how benevolent or paternalistic an employer may be, workers 
run into problems on their jobs. And when they do, they need some kind of 
mechanism to adjudicate those problems." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of some other mechanism for assuring fairness, Winpisinger says, 
workers will turn to unions for help. "As our tarnished image begins to accept 
polish again the phone will begin to ring," he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, he says, organized labor is going through "just another rebuilding 
period that we essentially had to go through, partly because of the way we 
conducted our own institution." In fact, it is the way that labor conducted 
itself in the past that concerns him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Magic to It' 
</P>
<P>
"In my judgment," he says, "the challenge for labor leadership in the future is 
one, and one only: When the country does see fit to repose power in the hands 
of labor leadership that it has to be used more wisely and judiciously than 
ever in our history. It has to be used responsibly, not recklessly, not 
wantonly, but very, very responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
As he sees it, organized labor can no longer use power "totally for its own 
grand design." He said he did not agree with the philosophy of the late AFL-CIO 
President George Meany, who, he says, believed that "the use of unbridled power 
was not sinful." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be prepared to try to discipline ourselves so as not to indulge 
in the excesses that will cause the pendulum to take another violent swing in 
the future," he says. "There's no magic to it. It takes a lot of work, a lot of 
persuasion. It takes a hell of a leader." 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, Winpisinger says, labor leaders must spend less time 
worrying about wages and more time worrying about broader social issues that 
affect workers. "It's going to require a leader who can lead on the social and 
philosophical side as the beacon on which you moderate economic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Winpisinger says this doesn't mean unions should no longer be militant or 
strike. Citing the example of Eastern Air Lines, where the IAM is locked in a 
bitter struggle for control of the carrier, Winpisinger says: "Obviously, if 
someone wants to fight, you've got to take them on." 
</P>
<P>
But Winpisinger sees no room in the future for wage settlements at one firm 
being goals that unions at other companies or in other industries insist on 
beating. The result, he says, is "terrible distortions" that "drive the whole 
wage totem pole out of kilter." He insists that there must be a recognition 
among union leaders that some jobs deserve more pay than others. 
</P>
<P>
Winpisinger, who takes pride in being viewed as a leader of labor's political 
left wing, cites the experience of unions in Western Europe as the direction 
U.S. labor go. In Europe, he says, trade unions are part of the mainstream of 
government policy-making and help set economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the future of labor-management cooperation in the United States as 
American industries scramble to be competitive in world markets, Winpisinger 
insists that problem is related to the need for labor to have a voice in social 
and economic policy. And he doesn't see the effort to be competitive going very 
far unless business changes its tactics toward labor. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation is a two-way street," he says. "And I don't consider it 
cooperation if I sit down on behalf of our members and make a deal . . . and we 
give up a lot of work rules that may or may not have outlived their usefulness, 
we put on a good show in terms of production and the company makes a buck and 
we make a buck.
