   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp., which has been struggling
to overcome its poor image for quality, said it is recalling
911,000 cars, most of them Chevrolet models with shoulder
belt mechanisms that could fail in an accident and have been
linked to one injury.
   Some of GM's newly redesigned 1992 near-luxury Buick,
Oldsmobile and Pontiac models also are being recalled to fix
possible defects in parking brakes.

   GM has been trying to convince consumers that its cars are
much improved in quality and design, using an advertising
slogan of "GM Puts Quality on the Road." But the recalls
announced yesterday illustrate the challenge GM faces in
making that message persuasive.
   Not only do older GM models have problems that the company
is just now diagnosing, but some newer cars apparently have
quality glitches that are getting through GM's heightened
quality checks.
   GM said it's recalling about 830,000 Chevrolet Corsicas
and Berettas built in model years 1990, 1989 and part of 1988
to fix shoulder belt mechanisms that may have cracked
mountings. The defect could render the shoulder belt useless
in a crash. Asked about the cost of this move, a GM spokesman
declined to provide an estimate, saying only "it is a very
expensive recall, obviously."
   GM said it knows of only one accident where a shoulder
belt retractor mechanisms failed and caused an injury.
   GM officials said their investigations show that the
plastic mounting for a pendulum mechanism that causes the
shoulder belt to lock during sudden braking could crack
through normal stress, such as opening and closing the door.
This could cause the pendulum to dislocate, and the front
seat wouldn't restrain a passenger during a crash.
   GM officials said they are urging owners to continue using
their seat belts because only a few vehicles may have a
faulty shoulder belt retractor, and in all vehicles the lap
belt will provide some protection. GM said it will notify
owners beginning Dec. 18 of the recall.
   In another safety recall, GM said it is recalling about
60,000 1991 Chevrolet Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunbirds to
replace a defective steel stud mounted in the front door
frames. The studs could crack, cause the shoulder belt to
loosen from the frame and fail to protect passengers in a
crash.
   The third recall involves a combined 21,000 cars. The
models affected are certain 1992 Buick Le Sabres, Pontiac
Bonnevilles and Oldsmobile Royales, and 1991 Buick Park
Avenue and Ultra models and Oldsmobile Elite and Touring
sedans. The parking brake levers in those vehicles may not
engage to keep the car from rolling on a steep hill.
   GM said it isn't aware of any accidents or injuries
resulting from the faulty steel studs or parking brakes. But
owners will be notified in all three actions, and repairs or
replacements will be made at no charge.
   Separately, GM said it plans to put air bags in all its
light trucks by late 1998 to comply with new federal safety
regulations. The No. 1 auto maker already has pledged to put
air bags in all its cars by the 1995 model year.
   The GM announcement comes just a week after Congress
passed a transportation bill that requires auto makers to
install both driver's side and passenger's side air bags in
trucks by the 1999 model year, which begins Oct. 1, 1998.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a
separate action earlier this year, said auto makers must
install either air bags or automatic seat belts in trucks
beginning in the fall of 1994.
   GM plans to put air bags in its front-wheel-drive minivans
by the 1994 model years. But the company didn't say when its
other trucks and vans will get air bags.
   Ford Motor Co. has said all its trucks will have driver's
side air bags available by 1994. Chrysler Corp., which was
the leader in putting air bags on its cars, plans to have air
bags on "a majority of its trucks" by the mid-1990s.
