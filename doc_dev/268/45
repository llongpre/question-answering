A seminal experience, announced the arts editor. Something that changed your
life and sparked your love affair with the art of your choice. Something
that made you what you are today. We journalists know this kind of piece. It
is the equivalent of being told by your employer, 'Here is a length of stout
rope, over there is a tree-branch.'
'Made me what I am today' - but what am I? And what film should be maligned
by being held responsible?
First I would have to subpoena two childhood memories, The Wizard Of Oz and
Prince Valiant. These made me fall in love with the experience of filmgoing.
The first sent shockwaves of delight through me by turning without warning
from black-and-white to colour: something I had no idea could be done either
in life or in cinema. The second film, in which Robert Wagner fought a bunch
of Arthurian baddies with nought but a broadsword and pudding-bowl haircut,
proved revelatory in the fact of being seen at a morning screening. My
parents took me to it in the West End. Aged eight, I could not believe that
bliss could start so soon after daybreak.
I must also record an adolescence devoted to Gothic cinema. Vincent Price
never knew how passionate a following he had among the students of Lancing
College, Sussex. We roamed the streets of Brighton in search of Mr Price and
Mr Poe. The Pit And The Pendulum, Tales Of Terror, The Haunted Palace -
these movies were succulently preposterous where others were portentous.
They soared to idiot heights and plumbed charnel depths. They taught us that
flimsy-budgeted, fly-by-night art could be as kinetic and imaginative as -
often more so than - the fatter, costlier products of the the world's dream
factories.
But if I must isolate and enthrone one movie, let it be a later one. Some
films are so powerful that they risk sending you out of the cinema rather
than holding you inside. As a child I fled Invaders From Mars in terror.
More recently Reservoir Dogs built up an atmosphere of evil so strong I kept
making a mental dash for the exit door. But I have never been dragged
through so many strong emotions, with such a merciless guiding intelligence,
as in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter.
I still believe that Cimino is a giant that Hollywood squandered rather than
 -usual version - a spendthrift egomaniac who half-bankrupted Hollywood.
Like Heaven's Gate, The Deer Hunter creates an entire community from the
ground up: something no other modern film-maker is capable of. The film's
Russian-American steel town is so well-painted, so densely characterised
that you can feel it, touch it, smell it. And when the film goes to Vietnam,
its fictionalised scene of psychological torture - the maligned 'Russian
Roulette sequence' - has a power on first viewing that leaves you almost
literally shell-shocked.
This is what cinema can do and should do: take you to a part of yourself and
your emotions you never knew existed. If The Deer Hunter was not the literal
truth about the Vietnam war, it was something more. It began by making the
cinema a window on the real world; then it turned that window into a
wound-opening into the American soul and the souls of all us.
In the years after its release and its multiple Oscar sweep The Deer Hunter
became politically incorrect. All the way from its demonisation of the
Vietcong to its supposed ill-treatment of animals, the movie became a giant
whipping boy for right-on thinkers. I know: I was there at the National Film
Theatre interviewing Cimino on stage on the day protesters threw
firecrackers among the audience.
No movie reaches greatness without offending someone. Such provocations are
the sign of a high-voltage imaginative experience wired to real events in a
real world. A short list of films that have been deemed politically
incorrect would include Birth Of A Nation, Napoleon, Battleship Potemkin, La
Regle Du Jeu and The Searchers. The Deer Hunter belongs right up there in
that company.
