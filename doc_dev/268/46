  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 25 January broadcasts its regular program 
"Details" presented by Nikolay Svanidze who comments on the 
Russian Federation defense budget, which is currently in the 
pipeline. This is followed by an exclusive interview with 
Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin. 
  Kokoshin begins by saying that in its present situation 
Russia needs a new armaments program but drawing it up is 
extremely difficult. Asked by the announcer if the Finance 
Ministry had been putting obstacles in the way of the program, 
Kokoshin said: "I would not like to criticize this particular 
ministry because I have a full understanding of their position: 
They had a clear task of reducing inflation by monetarist 
methods, and this resulted in chronic underpayments in 
practically all the main spheres covered by the budget, 
including the Defense Ministry. We had some disagreements in 
1993, sometimes quite bitter, but at the same time, I realize 
that their life is not easy either. It is another matter that 
we need to look for new forms of more stable financing." 
  Svanidze then recalls that President Yeltsin had promised to 
pay state-owned enterprises all the money owed to them by the 
state by 1 February, and asked Kokoshin if that promise would be 
fulfilled. Kokoshin says: "I believe that it will be fulfilled, 
but the question is to what extent. Just now complicated work 
-- or I might as well call it violent struggle -- is in progress 
about who should get their money first and how much of it. We 
order for defense." 
  Asked by the announcer about his personal standpoint when 
discussing the budget in the government, and if he was capable 
of reconciling the requirements of the defense industry with the 
awareness that it is a burden on the national economy, Kokoshin 
replies: "We have no wish to form our budget through robbing our 
own country, and I can tell you that in the past too much money 
was invested in the defense industry, and often those were 
rather imprudent investments. Now the pendulum has swung in the 
opposite direction. I think one of my tasks, and those of my 
colleagues, is to prove that the pendulum should be brought to a 
more balanced position, and that our Armed Forces should be 
equipped as they deserve." 
  Finally, Svanidze asks Kokoshin how he thought the current 
government reshuffle would affect the defense budget. Kokoshin 
replies: "In my opinion, the approach we had before was really 
too monetarily oriented, and I have also argued -- both at the 
open and closed sessions with Boris Fedorov and with other 
adherents of this approach. I think it insufficient, to put it 
mildly, and I hope that we will at last begin to stimulate 
industry.
