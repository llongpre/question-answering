<LEADPARA>  IN RECENT years, some of the financial institutions we considered our safest
havens turned out to be the most fragile.;    First, we had the collapse of
the savings and loan industry, which helped devastate the construction
industry and will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Then came the failure of several of our largest banks, which depleted
government deposit insurance funds and prompted regulators to curb bank
lending, which in turn helped send the economy into its current tailspin.;   
Now we have the collapse of First Executive, the largest life insurance
failure in the industry's history, and mounting -- though still minor --
concern about other insurance companies.;    And along the way we've had the
conviction of a handful of super-rich Wall Street executives for insider
trading and market manipulation, sent a few bank and S&amp;L crooks to jail and --
just last week -- learned that before First Executive collapsed, Fred Carr,
its chief executive, tried to sneak $11 million out of the company.;   
Unfortunately, the problem isn't just a few individuals. It also includes how
our financial institutions are run, how they're regulated and what we as
consumers expect from them. Each of those elements must change if financial
institutions are to play their proper role as catalysts for economic growth
and security rather than sources of scandal, instability and concern.;    
DURING THE 1980s, many executives ran their financial institutions with little
regard -- or at least little understanding -- of risk. They invested billions
in speculative foreign loans, junk bonds and bad real estate loans. We've all
been paying the piper.;    Financial institutions should take some risk -- and
there will be some failures. That's the capitalistic system -- one that
encourages almost all businesses to try something new.;    But in the 1980s,
the pendulum swung too far toward risk -- often without severely penalizing
those who made the bad choices. Carr and the top executives of most failed
financial institutions managed to do quite well for themselves.;    The
performance of regulators in the 1980s is even worse than that of greedy -- or
ineffective -- executives. Many of the executives at least achieved some of
their objectives: building big institutions, albeit temporarily, and getting
rich. Many regulators didn't even understand what was happening, let alone
know how to react.;     CONGRESS, THE president and many state governors and
legislatures wrote the rules that allowed S&amp;Ls to gamble with taxpayer money.
When regulatory officials tried to stop them, legislators often intervened.;  
 Meanwhile, wily executives armed with computers and advanced financial
expertise created financing techniques that many regulators don't have time --
and often the knowledge -- to understand. Beefing up regulatory operations
sufficiently would cost millions.;    Unfortunately, there's probably little
consumers can do in the short run to change the way executives of financial
institutions and regulators approach their jobs. But we can change our
expectations.;    We need to be more sensitive and careful about the
institutions we use for banks, insurance and for our other investment and
retirement funds.;    Most important of all, we need to focus more on levels
of risk and less on rate of return. In almost all instances that we're offered
a significantly higher return, it's because there's more risk -- which means
we're more likely to lose money or have increased volatility.;    By focusing
on return without enough regard for the consequences, even small investors
helped provide weak or criminal executives with the cash they needed to do
business, and ultimately, to fail, dragging others down with them.  </TEXT>
