<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation State Duma, by Valentina Nikiforova, under the 
general heading "Spring. Another Thaw in Russia?"; place and 
date not given: "Ivan Rybkin, Chairman of the Russian 
Federation State Duma: On Amnesty Without Hysteria"] 
  [Text] Hardly had the cell doors closed behind those 
accused of the events of September-October last year than the 
State Duma came under fire: "They have released the criminals!" 
"They have intervened in the president's prerogative!" 
Prosecutor A. Kazannik, admittedly after a slight delay, called 
the State Duma decree on the amnesty "the most shameful page in 
the history of Russian parliamentarism." 
  What actually happened? Your PRAVDA correspondent put that 
and other questions to Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, chairman of the 
State Duma. 
  [Rybkin] One has to view the amnesty calmly and without 
hysteria. The Duma adopted two decrees on the amnesty in 
connection with the adoption of the Constitution on the 
president's initiative. The first decree allows a little over 
20,000 people to be released from their places of confinement 
and around 200,000 people on probation. The second decree -- on 
the economic and political amnesty -- will set 20 times fewer 
people free. The point of the amnesty is that all those who 
have erred are being given a chance to enter life at a quite 
difficult and critical time. The aim is to consolidate society 
so as to pull the country out of chaos by joint efforts. 
  [Nikiforova] It is a humane act. After all, the idea of the 
amnesty came from the president himself and was supported by 
virtually all factions in the Duma. 
  [Rybkin] That clearly does not suit those who look forward 
to clashes between the branches of power, between the State Duma 
and the Federation Council, and between the president and the 
Federal Assembly. But I think that we -- the deputies and the 
executive -- are intelligent enough not to organize 
Russian-style gladiatorial contests for everyone else's 
entertainment. My advice is not to wait with malicious relish 
until the pendulum swings the other way but to remember that we 
are fellow countrymen. 
  [Nikiforova] Nevertheless, they are accusing the Duma of 
haste. 
  [Rybkin] I do not believe that. We did a lot of work in 
committees. As for the procedure for the application of the 
decree, we discussed it with the Interior Ministry. The general 
prosecutor asked for clarification -- and members of the 
committees on legality and security clarified every point. They 
worked on Friday and Saturday. 
  [Nikiforova] But on Saturday people were already coming out 
of jail, in other words they were released immediately. That 
clearly was alarming. 
  [Rybkin] But that is just the beginning. No amnesty is an 
instantaneous act. There are different situations, they have to 
be examined. And an adequate time limit is set for this -- six 
months. 
  [Nikiforova] How do you assess the general prosecutor's 
conduct? 
  [Rybkin] It is vexing that A. Kazannik has behaved so 
inconsistently. He knew that the decree on the amnesty had 
been adopted as part of a package in which the main 
document is the "Memorandum on Accord," signed on 22 February by 
all the factions, even Russia's Choice (although unfortunately 
the next morning, 23 February, they changed their stance). Now 
when a mountain of work has been dumped on the General 
Prosecutor's Office -- work that is necessary for society (it 
must be cleansed and stabilized) -- the general prosecutor is 
resigning. The new man will need time to settle in. 
  [Nikiforova] Ivan Petrovich, are those who have been 
amnestied completely exonerated? 
  [Rybkin] That is a difficult question. In adopting the 
decree the deputies created an area of accord. In consenting to 
this release, those under investigation wrote a statement to 
that effect. For them that is a serious warning. It is no 
coincidence that the Criminal Code includes amendments 
increasing punishments which coincide with those contained in 
the articles of the decree on the amnesty.
