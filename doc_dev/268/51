<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Gaydukevich, chairman of the Popular </F>
Movement of Belarus, by Andrey Korabelnikov; place and date not 
given: "There Are Only Three Forces in Belarus"] 
  [Excerpt] There are 13 political parties and over 
100 different movements in Belarus today. A SEM DNEY 
correspondent has interviewed People's Deputy Sergey 
Gaydukevich, chairman of the Popular Movement of Belarus [PMB], 
on the real political power of these organizations. 
  [Gaydukevich] There are many parties and movements. 
However, that does not imply that they are cardinally 
different. The world has long been acquainted with the pendulum 
principle. This principle accounts for only two determining 
forces. These forces can be assessed in many terms, but in 
their essence they are either "right" or "left." Political 
power is also controlled either by the former or the latter -- 
it never rests in the middle. Therefore, any party or movement 
gravitates either to the "right" or to the "left." One force 
stands for the superiority of government property and the 
implementation of major social programs, the other stands for 
the superiority of the private sector and the reduction of state 
subsidies for social security programs. A state that tries to 
stop the movement of that pendulum is in dire straits. 
Unfortunately, this is the situation in which we find ourselves. 
  There are only three real political forces in the Republic: 
the PMB, the Belarusian Popular Front [BPF], and...the Council 
of Ministers. All the others are satellites. With regard to 
the Council of Ministers being a third political force, it is an 
obvious fact. It is not without reason that people speak about 
Kebich's policy; no other politicians or economists are 
mentioned. In our situation, this force speaks of reforms, but, 
thus far, its declarations have not been supported by practical 
actions. 
  The second influential force was -- and remains -- the BPF. 
This organization has a concrete political and economic 
program. BPF representatives work in different command 
structures, participate in Supreme Soviet activities, and exert 
significant influence on mass media. The determining factor in 
their activities is private property. However, their proposal 
for the resolution of the national question has pushed many 
people away from the BPF. The BPF is supported by fewer and 
fewer people. 
  The third force is the PMB, which is a peculiar union of 
unions. We bring together 22 parties and movements from 
throughout the Republic. What does that mean? It means that 
all these organizations are united in one front. Their 
independence is secured, but common goals will be achieved 
together. The basic principle of our movement is the return of 
a strong system of state power, as well as economic diversity 
with social security guarantees for workers. [passage omitted]
