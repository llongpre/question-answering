Lainie Kazan will play Danny Aiello's wife in Fox's "29th Street," which goes 
before the cameras Oct. 22 in North Carolina and New York. Writer-director 
George Gallo bases his script on the true story of Frank Pesce, a.k.a. Frank 
the Fish, an actor he met on the set of "Midnight Run." The film, produced by 
David Permut, focuses on Pesce's relationship with his father in a New York 
Italian neighborhood during the '70s. The film also stars Anthony LaPaglia, 
Robert Forester and, yes, Frank Pesce as his own older brother.
