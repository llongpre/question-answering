<LEADPARA>  As civil rights leaders sought to convince the television cameras of their
victory Wednesday, the man they call their "legislative champion" stood
quietly by, unable to hide the frustration creasing his face.;    For Rep. Don
Edwards, D-San Jose, the battle over the Civil Rights Act of 1991 has provided
a bitter reminder of the power of racial politics in America.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "There's no advantage in it for us, it's not right and it divides our
country," fumed Edwards, 76, whose experience with the issue dates to the
first Civil Rights Act 27 years ago.;    Then, with his next breath, he
offered a theory for the persistence of the issue: "And speaking candidly, it
hurts Democrats with the white voters in this country.";    Rancorous debate; 
During the weeks of jockeying over this year's legislation, there has been
disagreement over who bears responsibility for a fight that pits Democrat
against Republican and, often, black against white. Have conservatives like
President Bush unfairly accused Democrats of supporting hiring quotas that
hurt whites, or have liberals like Edwards let their passion for minority
advancement blind them to the rights of the majority?;    What few people
dispute is that the debate is helping to widen racial fissures that still
cleave U.S. society. And no one, perhaps, regrets that result more deeply than
Edwards.;    When activist Ralph Neas introduced Edwards at a Wednesday press
conference as "Congress' foremost protector of civil rights," there was scant
hyperbole involved. Edwards was in the thick of rights legislation from the
moment he joined Congress in 1963. Today, he serves as chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, and the issue all but
consumes him.;    Sending a message; "This bill is not as important for its
substantive portions," he said of the arcane 1991 act, "as it is for the
politics involved. We've got to send a message that civil rights laws have
been and continue to be one of the best parts of our society." He spoke during
a 45-minute interview in his office last week.;    But Edwards said this
message is more difficult to communicate today, because the powerful symbols
lie mostly on the other side. Twenty-seven years ago, a liberal Congress
member could invoke the memories of murdered civil rights workers or the
specter of Bull Connor and George Wallace; today, it's the opposition that can
drop the potent buzzword "quotas," or broadcast commercials of the white man
who loses a job to a less-qualified member of a minority group.;    Edwards
insists that the Democratic perspective on civil rights reflects "the
mainstream of American thinking." But if so, that mainstream has remained
silent of late.;    Asked how his constituents had reacted to his efforts this
year, Edwards rose from his chair and called to an assistant, "How's our
mail?" The response: "Very light.";    Nevertheless, Edwards insists that
Democrats cannot abandon a core issue just because it now has the ability to
harm them. "I've got to believe the pendulum is going to swing back," he said.  </TEXT>
