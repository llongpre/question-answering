<LEADPARA>  THE garden in winter: Often it's not a pretty sight. Overcast skies and barren
trees can produce dreary effects in the landscape.;    Yet there's something
intense and dramatic about the silhouettes of certain deciduous trees on stark
January days. Maybe it has to do with the bracing, dry air, or the long,
slanting rays of winter sun that we get as the Earth tilts on its axis.;   
Whatever the reason, these trees have much to offer after they've stepped out
of their spring-and-summer coats of leaves. Baring it all, they reveal
crowd-pleasing qualities.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     From container plants to lawn trees, they supply distinctive, peeling bark,
graceful form or dried pods or fruit. They may cast interesting shadows that
grow ever longer into twilight.;    And lighting the trees with one or two
ground spotlights pointed up through the branches helps to sustain the magic
into night.;    Unlike plopping a six-pack of pansies into a pot or
cultivating a bed of calendulas, planting these trees is not a quick antidote
for the winter doldrums. But over time, they will provide invaluable structure
and backbone to your winter landscape.;    (box)  Corkscrew willow,
dragon-claw (Salix matsudana Tortuosa): Like the bottle-opening device that
lends its name, this willow curls and spirals its branches into long, slender
corkscrews. In summer, it looks like a bright green dome, with narrow leaves
blanketing the branches. But come winter, it becomes an arching fountain,
spilling thousands of soft-gray corkscrews. Uplighting the tree at night is
spectacular. By day, its bark is a checkery gray.;    Corkscrew willow grows
fast to 25 to 30 feet and is a bit taller than it is wide. As with other
willows, it likes regular water.;    (box)  Chinese Elm (Ulmus parvifolia): A
bit iffy about shedding its leaves, Chinese elm is usually deciduous in areas
where night-time temperatures are consistently in the low 20s or colder.
Lingering winter leaves or not, its new bark is a soft, rich pink coupled with
pale gray or brown. It grows quickly into a round-headed tree standing 35 to
60 feet, with a somewhat broader stance. Its sturdy branches reach out
parallel to the ground, then curve gracefully back toward earth.;    (box)
European white birch (Betula pendula): The weeping form of this popular birch
is striking. The slender branches reach skyward, gracefully curve, then
plummet back toward Earth. The bark peels off in large patches and is mottled
in shades of brown, black, gray and white. In winter, dried fruit that looks
somewhat like miniature pinecones dangles from the bare branches.;    European
white birch is at its best planted in small groves of three, five or more
trees.;    It prefers regular watering and lives happily at the edge of a
lawn. Named varieties include cutleaf weeping birch (Betula pendula
Dalecarlica  or Laciniata) and Young's weeping birch (B.p. Youngii). They
offer different branching, heights and bark color .;    It bears noting that
the Latin names of certain trees offer clues about their mature form.;   
Here, the term pendula refers to branches that are pendulous or hanging
downward.;    (box)  Flowering quince (Chaenomeles speciosa, C. japonica,
Cydonia japonica): This Chinese native shrub lends an oriental feel to the
garden and is a popular bonsai plant in Japan.;    But without such rigorous
training, flowering quince eventually reaches about 10 feet tall and spreads
as wide. Dozens of whip-like branches spring up from the base, then fork in
all sorts of asymmetric directions. White, pink or red cup-shaped flowers
appear along the barren branches from now through March.;    You can curb the
winter blahs inside by harvesting a few year-old stems after their buds have
begun to swell. Place them in water in a warm spot indoors and the flowers
will soon open.;    Spines on most flowering quince varieties are vicious. A
mature plant presents a virtually mnpenetrable barrier to animals and humans.
Provided you can easily reach it, the oval fruit is edible and ready to pick
in late fall.;    (box)  Harry Lauder's walking stick  (Corylus avellana
Contorta): The word "contorta" has been applied to this filbert tree with good
reason. The pencil-thin branches twist in all sorts of contortions that even
Henry Houdini would have found difficult to mimic. Hanging from the
grayish-green branches in winter are small catkins that are just as
contorted.;    This is the kind of plant that elicits oohs, aahs and perhaps
even spontaneous applause.;    For an up-close performance, put it in a large
pot and water it regularly. Harry Lauder's walking stick will eventually twist
and turn its way up toward 10 feet tall.;    (box)  Crape myrtle
(Lagerstroemia indica): Crape myrtle is perhaps best known for the profusion
of its late-summer pink, scarlet or purple flowers. But crape myrtle is also
attractive in winter, when the falling leaves expose its shedding bark and
graceful, branching form.;    Leave crape myrtle as a large shrub, or prune it
into a small tree that will eventually top out at about 25 feet. It flourishes
in hotter, drier locations. With too much coastal fog, mildew can become a
serious challenge.;    (box)  California sycamore (Platanus racemosa): Allow
plenty of elbow room for this California native. It quickly grows to 75 feet
or more, while its sturdy limbs may sprawl 20 feet in each direction. Commonly
found along stream banks, its deep roots search out moisture underground
during dryer months (although it is not nearly as drought tolerant as native
oaks).;    The sycamore sheds its bark in rough patches of white, gray, beige
or green to reveal smooth, lighter-colored bark underneath. The bark darkens
with age -- upper branches are often noticeably lighter in color. Over time,
deep cracks start at the base and rise up the trunk.;    In winter, clusters
of marble-sized, stickery balls hang from the branches. They're useful in
dried arrangements.;    (box)  Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba): The Chinese
have dried, pickled, stewed and made candy out of the sweet fruit of Chinese
jujube for centuries. Its value in the winter landscape is its slender,
weeping form which may reach 25 to 30 feet tall over time. The branches bear
short thorns and fissured bark.;    Chinese jujube is attractive in other
seasons as well. Shiny, green leaves appear in spring, followed by clusters of
small, creamy flowers in late spring or early summer. The fruit emerges a pale
green, then ripens to red by fall in warmer areas. (Fruit may not fully mature
in coastal areas.) In all, the leaves turn canary yellow before dropping.;   
Chinese jujube sends down deep roots and is not fussy about drought or heat.
But regular watering does promote a crop of larger fruit.  </TEXT>
