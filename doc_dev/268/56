BROADCASTERS are applying wise old heads and new technology to the most
comprehensive coverage of the results of a general election.
ITN's coverage through the night will feature Sir Robin Day. Back with the
ITN election team for the first time in more than 30 years, he will
interview senior politicians and pundits in the studio.
ITN has also found a use for the vast atrium in its new London headquarters.
It will be transformed into a life-size electronically generated House of
Commons. John Suchet will walk among political mirages. As the results come
in, ghostly figures in red, blue or yellow will change sides.
At the BBC Peter Snow, handling his eighth election, supported by political
editor John Cole who covered his first election in 1945, will preside over
the return of the Swingometer.
This 16 ft neon-lit pendulum is a long way from the 5 ft wooden version last
seen during the 1979 campaign.
As Peter Snow moves the pendulum across the scale, percentage point by
percentage point, computers will change target seats from blue to red or
vice versa to give what the BBC describes as 'an instant and
clearer-than-ever understanding of the election night battle for power'.
A separate battleground graphic will tell the Liberal Democrat story.
Peter Sissons, who succeeded Sir Robin as presenter of Question Time, will
take over Sir Robin's election night mantle, interviewing politicians and
guests in the studio.
Behind main BBC presenter David Dimbleby, in a refurbished 10,800 sq ft
studio, will be a 20 ft by 16 ft projector screen able to carry simultaneous
pictures from four outside broadcasts - BBC cameras will be at 85 locations.
After a three-and-a-half-hour break for Breakfast News, David Dimbleby will
be back on air until 5.30pm.
As befits devolutionary times, Scottish viewers will be able to choose the
full UK story on BBC1 or their own programme on BBC2.
The BBC's main Election 92 programme is being transmitted live throughout
the night on BBC World Service Television's Asian and European satellite
services and will be available to millions of viewers from China to
Czechoslovakia.
BBC World Service radio will run an election special for five hours
beginning at 2200 GMT.
ITN, which is spending Pounds 2m on its programme, will use 1,000 staff and
freelance journalists to try to be first with the results. It claims it was
first in 450 of the 651 seats in 1987.
Election 92, which will have Jon Snow in the anchor chair following the
retirement of Sir Alastair Burnet, is believed to be the longest programme
ever broadcast on ITV without commercial breaks - it will run for more than
eight hours until TV-am begins at 6am.
Both ITN and the BBC will aim to reduce the uncertainty and excitement by
broadcasting exit poll results, which tend to give a good forecast, early in
the evening.
Sky News, for its first election, will offer a 24-hour results programme
spearheaded by David Frost and Selina Scott.
A 1,000 sq ft screen in the studio will show the interior of the House of
Commons and an eight-screen video wall will display graphic interpretations
of how the voting has gone.
Channel 4 lives up to its reputation for providing an alternative. At 10pm
it shows Scandal, the film about the Profumo affair. Later it will move to
the real Marxists - the Marx brothers and Duck Soup.
