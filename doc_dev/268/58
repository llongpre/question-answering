ON YOUR OWN: WHAT DEFINES THE 'SUCCESSFUL' WOMAN?

I recently printed a letter from "a successful single woman" of 40 who had 
begun to question her career strivings. She has the income, status, elegant 
apartment, expensive clothes and vacations that come with success, but she 
often asks herself what she has really accomplished. She added: "What is so 
important about increases in my company's sales figures? . . . Am I single 
because I concentrated on my career?" 
</P>
<P>
I asked my women readers to send me their thoughts and reactions to her letter. 
Here are two (I'll print more later) that give much food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
An Indiana woman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I am a 30-year-old single woman, well educated, living in my own home and 
supporting myself. After graduating from business school several years ago, I 
took a position with a prestigious Fortune 500 company. I was immediately put 
on the "fast track." I was working 12-hour days and weekends, earning more 
money than I ever imagined and surely was headed for 'success.' 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all this, there was a certain sense of emptiness and loneliness in my 
life. Here, I seemed to have everything but felt that I had nothing. Gradually 
I began to realize that I had forfeited outside interests and relationships in 
favor of my career -- I had chosen a corporate culture that demanded that of 
me. My only source of self-esteem was my career -- what I did was the same 
thing as who I was. 
</P>
<P>
"What changed me? Luckily, one day I was informed I would be 'counseled out' 
because my performance wasn't up to par. I was unemployed for many months. This 
gave me more than enough time to examine my life's priorities and what 
'success' and 'failure' meant to me. 
</P>
<P>
"My life is very different today. I have a job that I enjoy very much, but I 
also take time for myself -- my outside interests, relationships, etc. I guess 
I could sum it up in a word -- balance. My career is important to me, but so is 
my running, my boyfriend (I have time for one now!), friends, etc. That sense 
of disquiet and emptiness has been replaced with intimacy, both with myself and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 'woman-at-home' or 'woman-at-work' dilemma, the pendulum has swung from 
one extreme to the other in two generations. After watching my mother's 
frustration at being a housewife, a career on the 'fast track' seemed to be the 
answer to happiness. Like most things, the answer is probably somewhere in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
Similar views were expressed in a letter from a California woman who said that 
wanting to establish her career identity "first" came naturally to her. Her 
mother was a professional, and she had witnessed many women "trapped in unhappy 
marriages because they were so utterly dependent on their husbands." So, by her 
mid-20s she had "a satisfying career in the business world and achieved all the 
trappings of success and power." 
</P>
<P>
However, she recognized two disturbing aspects about herself: 
</P>
<P>
"One was that I was still unhappy. All the success in the world could not make 
up for the satisfaction derived from a true and intimate love in my life. The 
other was that I was losing some aspects of my personality -- the gentle, soft 
and compassionate side. I did not like the self I was becoming. From that point 
on, I decided to keep my life and my personality 'balanced' while maintaining 
an active life in the business world as before. Now, several years later, I am 
very happily married and I like my 'balanced' self much better. 
</P>
<P>
"The task is not easy. The business world still is not the least bit 
sympathetic toward love, family and softness. I have observed many women 
blindly absorb every characteristic of the competitive world and be reduced to 
half a person. They focused only on work, competition and power, instead of 
growing and evolving into a fuller self. I feel sad whenever I see a perfectly 
normal, competent yet feminine woman turning into a hard, unfeeling monster."
