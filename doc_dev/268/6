   Dr. Gernot Winkler is a government bureaucrat
with plenty of time on his hands.
   Winkler's offices at the U.S. Naval Observatory are crowded with
sundials, hourglasses, bejeweled antique watches, pendulum clocks,
quartz clocks and atomic clocks so incredibly accurate that Winkler
has no excuse for being late to work.
   ``Our business is time,'' says Winkler, 67, an Austrian-born
astronomer and theoretical physicist who has been America's
official timekeeper for the past 24 years. A well-worn scythe, the
familiar emblem of Father Time, is propped up near his desk.
   Winkler's master timepiece is the atomic clock, which actually
consists of 24 box-like metal instruments housed in eight
climate-controlled vaults scattered around the observatory's
tree-shaded grounds on a northwest Washington hillside.
   Each of the faceless clocks contains cesium atoms which, when
heated to a low boil, emit faint beams of light from
electromagnetic radiation at an unchanging frequency of
9,192,631,770 cycles per second.
   Every hour, computers automatically compare readings from all
the clocks to produce a uniform time that doesn't vary more than a
nanosecond _ one-billionth of a second _ from day to day. Some of
the atomic clocks are accurate to one-tenth of a nanosecond.
   To set all his clocks, Winkler relies on a network of radio
astronomers from Hawaii to Bologna, Italy. They determine the exact
position of Earth as it rotates on its axis by taking a
simultaneous fix on some distant star sending signals from the
depths in space, millions of light-years away.
   The precision of the atomic clock seems unbelievable in a world
weary of wristwatches that suddenly stop and alarm clocks that
don't ring.
   It is so accurate, says Winkler, that it's not the clock but the
rest of the world that goes wrong.
   Every year or two, Winkler adds a ``leap second'' to the atomic
clock's time to compensate for a very slow decrease in the Earth's
rotation, which is thrown slightly out of kilter by winds, ocean
currents, earthquakes and even melting snow.
   Today's master clock is 10 million times more accurate than the
quaint old pendulum clocks that tick-tocked the official time until
as recently as 1950, when the observatory switched to quartz clocks
and then _ eight years later _ to cesium atomic beam clocks.
   Nonetheless, time doesn't weigh heavy for Winkler the way it
does for the Maytag repairman.
   No matter how flawlessly his atomic clocks run, he says, he must
keep trying to shave off another millisecond here or there to meet
the increasingly sophisticated demands of electronic navigation and
communications systems, from deep-running nuclear submarines to
satellites beaming weather advisories to airports.
   ``We don't wait for something to happen,'' he said. ``We need to
be in the forefront of technological capabilities. If we didn't,
we'd be as obsolete as the pendulum clock in three to five years.''
   Already, he says a possible successor to the atomic clock is a
new device that employs ions or electrically charged atoms of
mercury that are trapped in an electromagnetic ``bottle'' and
produce a fluorescent glow with a much higher frequency than cesium
beams.
   When he's not busy perfecting his clocks and keeping an eye on
the observatory's time-of-day announcements by telephone (dial
1-900-410-TIME), Winkler says he answers an occasional piece of
``nut mail'' about the time.
   Like the guy who asked, ``What actually happens to the time you
waste?'' Or the request for an exact definition of a moment.
   A woman's letter _ one of Winkler's favorites _ inquired what
God did with his time before he created the world.
   ``I wrote back that he invented hell for people who ask stupid
questions,'' he said.
