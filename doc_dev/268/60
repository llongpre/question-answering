<LEADPARA>  THERE are so many excellent Australian plants it is hard to choose among them.
Here's a list of 12 Aussies chosen after a tour of the Slosson Gardens and
consultation with arboretum manager Brett Hall. The plants below are
beautiful, reliable and reasonably easy to grow. All survived the December
freeze -- if frozen back, they are sprouting again from their roots.;    (box)
GREVILLEAS: Plants range from ground covers to small trees 40 feet high. Robin
Gordon has striking bright red flowers, is easy to grow, and blooms year-round
at Slosson Gardens. Full of nectar, the blossoms attract hummingbirds.
Although frozen in the December freeze, it is returning from the roots.
Another outstanding choice is Grevillea lavandulacea, a pink-flowered variety
with several forms. Billy Wing is low-growing. Tanunda has gray foliage.
Grevillea lavandulacea is a spreading ground cover with holly-like leaves and
orange-red flowers that survived the frost nicely.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (box) KUNZEAS: Outstanding is Kunzea parvifolia, a three-foot spreading
mound of lavender blossoms that "sailed through the frost," says Hall, even in
"Frost Hollow," a low area where temperatures dropped to 14 degrees.;    (box)
HIBBERTIAS: There are approximately 100 hibbertias in Australia, all with
yellow or orange blossoms. Slosson Gardens has 40 of them, ranging from ground
covers to small shrubs. With bright, clear yellow blossoms, ground-hugging
Hibbertia pedunculata is a choice plant for a rock garden or container. It
proved frost-hardy last December.;    (box) CALLISTEMONS: The most commonly
planted bottle brush is the bright red Callistemon citrinus, but there are
many other choices, ranging from ground covers to tree height. Kings Park
Special is a graceful red-flowered variety with pendulous branches, growing to
10 feet high and 8 feet wide. Callistemon pallidus is a yellow-flowered form
reaching 7 feet high and 8 feet wide.;    (box) BANKSIAS: There are several
good garden species among these striking plants, which are members of the
Protea family. Banksia marginata is a tall beauty with yellow flowers. Banksia
ericofolia is readily available and highly adaptable. In Australia, it ranges
from Queensland to Victoria, sand heaps to mountains, and lives up to 20
years. Banksia repens, or Creeping Banksia, is an interesting ground cover.
Salmon-colored Banksia burdettii is good for cut flowers but frost-sensitive.;
   (box) LEPTOSPERMUMS: Also called Tea Tree, these plants are already
familiar to Western gardeners, but there are many more choices than those
commonly used. Leptospermum rotundifolium has large flowers ranging in color
from pink to lavender and is very drought tolerant. Leptospermum brevipes has
several forms, including a burgundy-foliaged form with a narrow columnar shape
that looks nice against buildings. It has white flowers and woody fruits.
There are weeping forms too.;    (box) CALYTRIXES: These are enchanting
myrtles from southeast Australia. Calytrix tetragona is a real showoff in
bright pink. The flowers are long lasting as well as showy. It reaches 3 to 4
feet tall and 5 feet wide.;    (box) PROSANTHERAS: An old clone long used in
Australian gardens is or Rosea, also called incense bush. It has a minty
smell, rose pink flowers and grows three to four feet tall. Another form is
Glen Davis, with dark purple flowers, which grows to 10 feet.;    (box)
CORREAS. The variety Correa pulchella has pink and orange forms. It does well
in shade and fog belts, producing pendulous flowers mostly in winter and early
spring. Dusky Rose is another popular cultivar.;    (box) DAMPIERAS: These
low-growing plants have flowers of eye-popping blues. The variety Dampiera
diversifolia, now available in the trade, spreads by putting out shoots. Some
froze in December, but are shooting back from the base.;    (box)
MICROMERTISES: "Really dazzling" is Hall's description of Micromertis ciliate,
good in rockeries and a great plant to cascade down a bank. It has pink buds,
white flowers and red seed pods.;    (box) EUCALYPTUS: It would hardly do to
write about Australian plants without mentioning the eucalyptus, almost a
trademark of the land down under. The big, messy Blue Gum is to be avoided,
but a handsome choice for a garden tree is Eucalyptus paucifolia or Snow Gum.
It has a nice white trunk, and, as the tree that grows at the highest
elevation in the Australian mountains, is super frost-hardy. The December
freeze didn't bother it at all. Notable for its bright yellow flowers is
Eucalyptus preissiana, one of the mallees -- shrubby eucalypts grown mostly
for their flowers.  </TEXT>
