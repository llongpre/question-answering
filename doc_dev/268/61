<LEADPARA>  THE force was with George Prather that day in 1940 when he climbed the hill to
survey his northern boundary. It threw his compass out of line and made him
feel odd, "light headed or top heavy." A year later, it put him in the tourist
business.;    Fifty years later, the Mystery Spot -- "Featured in Life
Magazine!" -- continues to attract the curious and the kitsch-obsessed. If
you're, say, a newlywed Japanese couple coming to Northern California on your
honeymoon, chances are the Mystery Spot will be on your itinerary. "Been on TV
twice already in Japan," says owner Bruce Prather. Another Japanese film crew
is due today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     What they find, after the bus wends its way up the narrow, bumpy road
through the Santa Cruz redwoods, is a gift shop, a little fencing, a turnstile
and a zigzag path winding steeply uphill toward a wooden cabin that appears to
have been jacked up on one side.;    The Mystery Spot is one of those
geological anomalies where what looks like down is up. It's distinguished
from, say, the road behind Utah's Capitol in Salt Lake City (where if you
point the car downhill it will roll back up) by the sheer intensity of the
experience.;    The force is strongest in the cabin, where to stand "upright"
-- that is, with your body perpendicular to your feet -- is to fall forward on
your face. You have to balance way over backward to keep from falling.;   
Balls roll uphill, and when they fall off the uphill end of a board, they fall
outward. A pendulum takes more strength to move in one direction than in
another, and when it swings, it spirals -- and spirals counter-clockwise, as
though it were in the Southern Hemisphere. If people of equal height stand on
bricks that can be measured as "level," one will appear 3 inches taller than
the other.;    Trees in the Mystery Spot bend and corkscrew. Birds avoid the
place, and squirrels, trying to leap from tree to tree, miss.;    What causes
all this? Tour guide Kiritani Masahiko says it's believed that a really dense
meteor once struck the place. Four forces are involved in what we experience:
gravity, magnetism, light and optical illusion.;    That's the party line, and
you can believe it or not. I toured the Spot with Berkeleyites Wallace and
Judy Bastein, their son Adam and Adam's friend Toby Wincorn. Wallace, a former
electrical engineer turned new home salesman, is a skeptic. He brought a plumb
bob, and found himself wishing for: his own level, a container of water and,
most of all, a spring-loaded device to measure whether it really takes more
force to move that pendulum in one direction than in the other.;    "That
doesn't prove anything," he mutters, watching the boys hang from handles in
the angled doorway. "If you build a house on a slant, of course, when you pull
yourself up, you're gonna swing out.";    Judy, who teaches fourth and fifth
grades at the Berkeley School, is more of a believer. "There's something," she
says. "There's a force working on the inner ear, I'm sure. You feel it.
There's something in there.";    Every visitor gets a bumper sticker, but
that's just the tip of the meteor, so to speak. Behold the gift shop, run by
Georgia De Vries, widow of a colleague of Bruce Prather's from his days as
manager of Santa's Village. Like such legendary gift shops as Wall Drug in
South Dakota, Forest Lawn in Glendale and the Winchester Mystery House, it's a
cornycopia of -- well, what do you call this stuff?;    There are ashtrays,
coral jewelry, salt shakers, redwood burls, log cabin banks, turquoise
jewelry, coonskin caps (actually rabbit fur, with coonskin tails), pennants,
pens, petrified wood jewelry and redwood postcards "for mailing or hanging."; 
  A plaque that says, "Anyone can be a Mother, but it takes someone special to
be a Mommy" can be yours for $3. Sweat shirts are $21, T-shirts $13.;    You
can buy redwood-and-cedar slingshots for $4.50, cedar eggs ("use with
clothing, purse, lingerie") for a buck. There are thimbles and key chains and
rabbits' feet, and for those of a religious bent, you've got your $5 crucifix
and your $3.50 crucifix.;    These last are distinguished, in this company, by
not having "Mystery Spot, Santa Cruz, CA" stamped across the front. No,
indeed. That would be tasteless. It's on the back.;  DETAILS:; The Mystery
Spot is at 1953 Branciforte Drive, Santa Cruz, but finding Branciforte Drive
is another mystery, and you won't solve it by going left on Branciforte
Avenue.;    The most direct route is: Hwy. 17/Ocean Avenue to Water Street
(look for Home Savings and Citibank on your left). Left two blocks to the
first light, Market Street (look for Adolpho's restaurant) and turn left
again. Market eventually becomes Branciforte Drive; follow the signs. The
Mystery Spot turnoff is about 3 miles from Water Street. Information: (408)
