"Will the real Mikhail S. Gorbachev please stand up?" 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans are asking that question, especially after the Soviet 
president's latest round of jet-set diplomacy followed by his assertion of 
domestic authority by cleaning out more aging "dead souls" from the Communist 
Party's Central Committee. The question is important, because it could 
determine whether the United States proves able to compete with the phenomenal 
leader in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Item: In Cuba, Gorbachev publicly opposed the export of revolution -- a pointed 
lesson for his host, Fidel Castro. But he also opposed the export of 
counterrevolution. This was a reference to the so-called Reagan Doctrine, under 
which the United States has supported the fight against pro-Soviet governments 
in Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Gorbachev said that he would not introduce nuclear weapons into the 
Western Hemisphere. But he also linked the reduction of other Soviet activities 
to a halt in U.S. meddling elsewhere, especially in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Item: In London, Gorbachev reiterated his European peace plan, which bedazzled 
many Western observers when he unveiled it last December at the United Nations. 
But he then hinted at disrupting East-West conventional force talks if the 
countries in the Atlantic Alliance modernize short-range nuclear weapons. The 
Soviet leader knew that he was stirring the Western pot because his hostess, 
Margaret Thatcher, supports modernization and the West German government can't 
touch it, politically. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Gorbachev has been bidding to join Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. He 
pushed Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to 
recognize Israel, and he has proposed to cooperate with the West in countering 
terrorism. But U.S. Defense Department sources say that the Soviets sold some 
advanced SU-24 fighter-bombers to Libya that, by Pentagon account, could reach 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
So which is the real Mikhail Gorbachev? Clearly, he is all of the above. And 
just as clearly, the West must learn to live with this fact. 
</P>
<P>
Making sense of Gorbachev is especially difficult in the United States. For the 
past 40 years, attitudes toward the Soviet Union have swung wildly. First, 
there was the Cold War, when nothing seemed possible in U.S.-Soviet relations. 
Then, in the 1970s, came detente and euphoric expectations that were dashed 
when Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan. Remarkably, Ronald Reagan hung onto the 
pendulum as it again swung from the "evil empire" to "my friend Mikhail." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the risk lies in expecting too much from the Soviet president. 
It is easy to see on television the rough and tumble of an unprecedented Soviet 
election and mistake it for Western democracy. It is tempting to witness a 
drastic reduction in Cold War tensions and believe it also means the end of 
significant East-West competition. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma is that the Gorbachev era could permit the most radical 
restructuring of East-West relations -- the best chance for reducing the 
military burden of confrontation -- in 40 years. But at the same time, the 
Soviet Union is no more willing and able to abandon all pursuit of power than 
it is to repeal the law of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
This Manichaean dilemma is illustrated by Western efforts to divine the Soviet 
leader's motives. 
</P>
<P>
Yet given the expectations that Gorbachev has raised about fundamental change 
in East-West relations, Western leaders cannot wait until one or another motive 
is proved. Inordinate delay poses twin risks -- the erosion of popular support 
for still-needed military security or the missing of an opportunity that, if 
now lost, might not return again soon. 
</P>
<P>
As the West's leader, the United States is particularly hard pressed. At home, 
George Bush is the first President who cannot escape the need to explain to the 
American people the dual nature of U.S.-Soviet relations: cooperation and 
competition, feast one day and famine the next. He must find a way to dampen 
the swinging pendulum of public opinion in order to craft sensible and 
sustainable policies toward Gorbachev's Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration faces an equal task abroad. The European allies are becoming 
impatient that the Western champion has yet to take the field against the 
challenger from the East. In London, Gorbachev taunted the United States for 
its delay. 
</P>
<P>
Time, however, has not yet run out. There is merit in the Administration's 
careful strategic review of a world in flux. And for all his diplomatic cheek, 
Gorbachev is playing a hand much weaker than that held by the American 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when the U.S. review is done, the President must have something 
to show for it. No later than next month's NATO summit, he must present a 
strategy to allies hungry for leadership in uncertain times. This was 
underscored this week by the hasty visit to Washington of West Germany's 
foreign and defense ministers, looking for a U.S. answer to Gorbachev's 
initiatives. Bush must provide a political rationale for preserving Western 
military strength, devise credible tests of Gorbachev's intentions and offer a 
long-term blueprint for a new breed of relations between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, by starting early and acting boldly, Gorbachev has presented Bush with 
perhaps the greatest task of statesmanship to face a U.S. President in 40 
years.
