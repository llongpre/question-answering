with tough choices as he formulates UK energy policy

Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may not spend much
time with his family this Christmas. The festive season will find him trying
to hammer together a plan to save British Coal in time to meet his
self-imposed deadline of publishing a white paper 'early in the new year'.
He will not lack ideas. In the seven weeks since British Coal triggered a
crisis with its announcement of 31 pit closures and the loss of 30,000 jobs,
he has been deluged with suggestions from industrial, social and public
interests. The parallel hearings conducted by the Commons select committee
on trade and industry have also produced hundreds of pages of testimony.
With the consultation period now drawing to a close, these will all go into
the melting pot.
The overall message is clear: Britain's energy policy, insofar as any
exists, is in a mess; people are confused and shocked by the decision to
shut down half the coal industry, and they think the answer lies in
government taking a more active role. But unfortunately for Mr Heseltine,
the torrent of words does not contain an easy solution to his dilemma.
If anything, the debate has shown that virtually anything he does to try and
increase coal's share of the UK energy market will have a knock-on cost,
either as higher prices, jobs lost or subsidies. It has also become evident
that he will be hard-pressed to save more than a third of the 30,000 jobs at
risk. But the result need not be just a short-term palliative. One of the
few encouraging points emphasised by the debate is that British Coal might
have stronger prospects if it can only be helped over the next three or four
difficult years.
Mr Heseltine's white paper will have to balance many competing aims. These
include:
saving a large enough number of coal jobs to quell public outrage, but
keeping the cost to a minimum;
achieving quick results, but also creating a sensible long-term framework;
taking government initiative without destroying the overriding aim of
introducing market forces into the energy sector;
making the rescue a boost rather than a burden to the economy as it
struggles to recover.
The fundamental question which Mr Heseltine will have to answer before he
considers possible courses of action is who will bear the cost of saving
British Coal, the taxpayer or the electricity consumer. The trade secretary
himself has put the total cost of keeping British Coal at its present size
at Pounds 1.2bn a year.
The case for placing the cost on the taxpayer is that saving miners' jobs is
essentially a social matter. Coal is uncommercial, and if wider national
considerations require it to be saved, the country at large should foot the
bill. But having only just agreed the spending cuts needed for the Autumn
Statement, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be in no mood to
countenance fresh outlays. Saving coal would add about a half penny to the
basic rate of income tax.
There is a stronger case for loading the cost on the electricity consumer.
Here, the argument is that saving coal is not a social matter but a prudent
way of diversifying the country's fuel supplies. A rescue financed by
consumers would also save the government a large sum of money by reducing
the state's redundancy bill for jobless miners.
Mr Heseltine may find it easier to bury the cost in electricity bills. At
the moment these are unlikely to rise next year because of the effect of
price controls. If Mr Heseltine forces them up, household consumers may not
notice much difference, though industrial consumers could kick up a fuss
about the threat to recovery: 'What we need is price decreases, not price
increases,' Mr Peter Rost, the chairman of the Major Energy Users Council
told the select committee.
None of the possible solutions would meet all of Mr Heseltine's
requirements. Some, such as the suggestion that power generators be asked to
hold larger coal stocks, are plainly impractical because their yards are
already bulging with coal, and British Coal itself has 20m tonnes lying
unsold. Suggestions that imports of coal and electricity should be banned
are ruled out by the commercial and diplomatic repercussions.
The solution that looks most attractive remains one of the first to be
mooted: the extension of the so-called franchise market in which most of the
electricity generated from British Coal's output is sold. Those in this
market, which consists of all but the 5,000 largest electricity consumers in
the country, have to buy power from their local distribution company. It
accounts for 70 per cent of electricity consumed, and prices have been
maintained at artificially high levels to help coal.
The intention was to phase the franchise market out in stages starting in
1994, and to liberalise competition completely by 1998. Mr Heseltine could
delay this timetable, either through legislation or with the agreement of
the electricity regulator, Prof Stephen Littlechild. Such a move would be
welcomed by many regional distribution companies which are not looking
forward to tougher competition, and it would place the cost on the consumer
rather than the taxpayer.
Above all, it would achieve quick results because it would give the
electricity industry confidence to sign up for larger deliveries of coal in
the new five-year contracts which they are negotiating with British Coal.
These contracts, due to start next April, are crucial to British Coal's
future.
The franchise market could be extended in a further way, along the lines of
a proposal by Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the largest
generator. He suggested that Mr Heseltine decree that this market could only
be served by electricity generated from coal produced in the UK. This would
mean excluding the controversial new gas-fired generators which have been
accused by large electricity users and the coal lobby of being uneconomic.
The present structure of the market allows the regional electricity
companies to pass on any higher costs directly to consumers. Mr Baker's
suggestion would also staunch coal imports.
Although Mr Baker's proposal looks self-serving because National Power is
the largest supplier of electricity to the franchise market, it would return
that market to the role for which it was originally created - to protect
coal. It would doubtless provoke a cry of protest  - and probably legal
action - from the gas projects' owners. But it would also put to the test
the claim which these projects have always made that gas can compete in a
free market. 'They can't have it both ways,' says Mr Baker.
Together, these measures could add 15m tonnes of coal to the 40m tonnes
currently expected to be burnt for power generation next year.
By contrast, the other front-running suggestion - that Mr Heseltine
accelerate the closure of the UK's ageing magnox nuclear reactors - has
fewer attractions. Although these reactors are currently subsidised to the
tune of Pounds 1.2bn a year, their closure would not save this money since
it is earmarked for decommissioning costs which will be needed anyway. On
top of that, premature closure would deprive the Treasury of the
considerable earnings which the magnoxes generate now that their costs have
been fully written down. Nuclear Electric puts the potential revenue loss at
Pounds 2bn.
A further drawback is that nuclear power stations cannot be closed down at a
stroke; their closure would not spark any immediate additional demand for
coal.
While Mr Heseltine will want quick results, he will also need to lay out
long-term plans in order to rebuild confidence in the energy sector. The
question here is whether he will want to institutionalise a more active
government energy policy by creating an energy commission, or even reviving
the department of energy which he scrapped only six months ago.
There is strong political support for the idea of an energy commission.
Public opinion seems to favour making the country's fuel mix a matter of
national policy which takes account of social, economic and environmental
needs. It also looks as if the select committee will back such a scheme.
The committee's hopes that Prof Littlechild would perform this role were
dashed when he told them that it was not his job to promote particular types
of fuel or save the coal industry. The committee subsequently welcomed a
blueprint for an energy agency proposed by Dr Dieter Helm, director of
Oxford Economic Research Associates.
But Mr Heseltine would have to decide whether closer government intervention
marked a large step back from its long-term plan of introducing market
forces into the energy sector. For one thing, it would require detailed
legislation. The cost of trying to dictate the fuel mix could also be huge
because of the subsidies and distortions it would introduce. The economics
of the electricity generation and distribution business would be radically
altered only two years after privatisation.
But are these fears exaggerated? Mr Francis McGowan of the Science Policy
Research Unit at Sussex University, a leading academic centre on energy
policy, says it should be possible to adopt a more active policy without
falling into the same mistakes as the past. The privatisation of the power
industry and the creation of regulators to protect consumers' interests have
made the market much more transparent. 'The pendulum has to swing back a bit
the other way,' he says.
Would a solution that created a market for an extra 15m tonnes of coal
production be enough? Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, delivered a
gloomy warning to the select committee. Because of the increases of
productivity which his company is making, the need for labour will fall
anyway. So even though 15m tonnes represents half the amount by which
British Coal production was due to be cut, it would at the most save only 10
of the 31 threatened pits, and a third of the miners' jobs.
But by the same token, a breathing space would enable British Coal to bring
more of its pits up to competitive strength. According to John T. Boyd, the
mining consultancy hired by the government to advise on the closures, 28 of
the pits could produce coal at an average price of Pounds 1.33 a gigajoule
within three or four years, and some could do better. That compares with the
current price of Pounds 1.80, and would take British Coal within range of
imported coal prices.
Mr Heseltine may conclude that it is worth holding back changes in the power
market in the hopes of securing these gains, and putting British Coal on a
sounder long-term footing, particularly if he can point to wider social
benefits. But there will be a hefty price to pay.
