<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- While going through my wife's wallet after her death, I found she
had been carrying a column of yours. I recalled how we roared with laughter as
we read it together, both well aware that after 43 years of marriage our love
for each other had little to do with the physical.;   My wife had an illness
that we both knew was fatal. She knew she would die first and wanted me to
find that column in her wallet. In a very real sense, it was a message of love
from the grave.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I shall carry that column in my wallet until I die, with a little note of
my own. Perhaps our children will hear our voices expressing the love we had
for each other.;   Although the description of the woman who wrote is
hilariously self-deprecating, I considered my wife the most beautiful woman in
the world. I'm writing in the hope that others may recognize real love when
they are lucky enough to have it.;   -- Anon. in Pa.;   DEAR ANON. -- What a
love story! Here's the column your wife carried:;   DEAR ANN -- This is for
"Marvin," who complained because his wife undresses in the bathroom.;   Here I
am, my love, in the nude (at your request). My bra that pushed me "up and out"
now lies in a heap on the floor. My breasts, now flat and pendulous, look as
if they might reach my navel.;   The foundation garment I wear to keep me tall
and straight (with a nice flat tummy), I have shed like a snake. My fanny is
drooping and my abdomen is amazingly round. If I still have toes, I sure as
heck can't see 'em.;   Now, my love, is it lights on or off? It's hell to be
old, but I'm yours -- you can make book on it.;   -- E in Oregon, Which is Not
Where I Live;   DEAR ANN -- My wife and I have several children, most of whom
are married and have children of their own.;   One daughter has a different
lifestyle. She has been living with another woman for several years, and we
have accepted this as best we can.;   I want to have a picture taken for the
purpose of recording our family genealogy. Copies will be sent to other family
members, as well as the local historical society.;   My daughter insists that
her "friend" be in the picture since she has lived with this woman longer than
her brother has lived with his wife. I am opposed to this and she is furious.;
  I suggested a separate picture for the book without her friend but she says
it is out of the question because the woman will be hurt if she is not
included.;   Am I wrong in wanting to exclude my daughter's live-in woman
friend from the picture? Please respond in print.;   -- A Troubled Mother;  
DEAR TROUBLED -- Genealogists include only members of the family by blood
relationships or marriage. Live-in partners, whether straight or gay, do not
qualify no matter how long they have been together.;   Perhaps it would help
if you showed your daughter a statement from the Historical Society describing
the guidelines. I recommend it.  </TEXT>
