   A profession once dominated by men appears about
to be taken over by women. Women have overtaken men enrolled in the
nation's veterinary schools over the past few years and if the
trend continues they are the ones who will be doing the hiring and
firing in the future.

   Dr. Mary Beth Leininger, her face wet
from the kisses of a white terrier puppy she is about to vaccinate,
remembers when women were highly outnumbered by men in veterinary
schools.
   Now the pendulum is swinging the other way. Just ask the
reigning Miss America, Debbye Turner, who soon will join the ranks
of women like Leininger tending to the medical needs of the
nation's animals.
   Leininger, who owns and operates a veterinary hospital in this
Detroit suburb with her husband, Dr. Steven Leininger, is one of
about 10,000 women veterinarians in the nation, according to the
American Veterinary Medical Association.
   Though Leininger has been a veterinarian for more than 20 years,
her 1967 class at Purdue University, with its seven women, was
typical _ about 93 percent male. It was a time when openings in the
schools were scarce, and not many women enrolled.
   ``The thought was, they are taking the place of a man who would
practice all his life,'' she says. ``That certainly has not been
borne out. All seven women who were in my class are still working
in the profession.''
   Women now outnumber men in the nation's 27 veterinary colleges,
said Dr. John Tasker, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at
Michigan State University.
   The trend started in 1983 when 50.1 percent of the applicants
were women, Tasker says. The next year, for the first time, the
entering class had more women than men. The percentage of
first-year women students has increased every year since, reaching
58.9 percent in 1988.
   Of 8,751 students enrolled in U.S. colleges of veterinary
medicine in 1987, 55 percent, or 4,816, were women, and 45 percent,
or 3,935, were men. If the trend continues, the profession could
become one of the first to change from being predominantly male to
predominantly female.
   The number of women now being trained as veterinarians is
extraordinary, says Dr. Dee Jacobson, a veterinarian in Berkeley,
Calif., and president of the 400-member Association for Women
Veterinarians founded in the 1940s.
   ``The profession is just beginning to acknowledge the tremendous
shift that has occurred,'' says Jacobson, a 1967 graduate of
California State University at Davis.
   Women in the veterinary profession got some added exposure in
September when Debbye Turner, a senior studying veterinary medicine
at the University of Missouri in Columbia, was named Miss America.
   Turner, who estimates that about half the students in her class
are women, says the salary gap between men and women veterinarians
also has begun to close.
   ``I didn't pursue veterinary medicine to get rich, and anyone
who does that is a disillusioned person,'' Turner says. ``It is a
profession based on compassion. That was my motivation. I loved
animals.''
   Turner says she decided to become a veterinarian after she spent
a summer ``shadowing a veterinarian'' as a 13-year-old. And she
says she won't forsake her ambition, even for a lucrative modeling
contract or a job delivering the evening news on TV.
   The average starting salary for veterinarians was $22,181 a year
in 1988, according to a survey by J. Karl Wise of Schaumburg, Ill.
   Wise, whose study was published this year in the Journal of the
American Veterinary Medical Association, reported that the average
starting salary is about 29 percent higher than in 1980, but is
only slightly higher after inflation is figured in.
   The average annual salary for veterinarians in private practice
in 1987 was $52,643, with veterinarians specializing in horses
earning an average of $60,653.
   Jacobson contends stagnant salaries among veterinarians caused
potential male students to seek other higher-paying biomedical
jobs. Bright women students, who traditionally are less concerned
with salary, filled the gap.
   The size of the applicant pool for veterinary medical college
decreased 43 percent between 1980 and 1988, and this year it's down
to 1.79 applicants per position.
   ``Getting in is the easiest it's been since World War II,'' says
Billy Hooper, executive director of the Association of American
Veterinary Medical Colleges.
   Dr. Paul Dieterlen in Napanee, Ind., where he and his partner
take care of large and small animals, has watched the number of
veterinarians shrink.
   The last time he went looking to hire a newly graduated
veterinarian he wrote to the veterinary medical colleges at Iowa
State, Ohio State, Michigan State, Illinois and Purdue. The
response for the $26,000-a-year job was disappointing, he says.
   Dieterlen says a male Purdue graduate eventually filled the
opening, but one of the agreements in the contract was that his
wife, also a veterinarian, would get to do some part-time work.
That was fine with him.
   ``They are saving our skin,'' he says. ``If we didn't have the
women in veterinary medicine we'd have half the students we have
now, or we'd have less-qualified men. They are going to be a major
force.''
