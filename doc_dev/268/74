<F P=106> [Interview with A.Ya. Livshits, leader of Russian Federation </F>
president's group of experts, by ITAR-TASS observer Tamara 
Zamyatina; place and date not given: "The Political Pendulum 
Might Swing to the Left, But There Are Still Lots of Things for 
Conservative Governments To Do in the Country, Aleksandr 
Livshits, Leader of the Russian Federation President's Group of 
Experts, Believes"] 
  [Text] [Zamyatina] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, the mutual 
influence of politics and economics is an obvious concept. 
Proceeding from this, how do you rate the unification of the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus]? 
  [Livshits] I believe that Russia will lose nothing as a 
result of this unification, if three conditions are fulfilled. 
First, monetary and credit emission must be carried out only by 
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Second, the Central 
Bank must act on the basis of Russian legislation and be guided 
by the maintenance of a weak inflationary regime on the 
territories of both countries. The third condition is that 
Belorussian money must be exchanged for rubles at the market 
rate, not at one "hare" [Belarusian currency] to the ruble. 
  The first condition is provided for in the agreement which 
has been concluded. There is no clarity with regard to the 
second condition. The third has not been abided by. This means 
that potential harm to Russia's economic interests cannot be 
ruled out. Therefore changes to Belorussia's legislation are 
needed for the real unification of the monetary systems. 
  [Zamyatina] What do you think: Will the union of monetary 
systems with Belorussia promote the political integration of the 
CIS states? 
  [Livshits] It is only in this case that it makes sense. If 
politicians show signs of moving toward a confederation -- signs 
equally strong as in the majority of citizens -- they will be 
supported by the population. But political rapprochement is 
something for the future, and national interests must not be 
waived either in the future or in the present. 
  [Zamyatina] Since you do not rule out harm to Russia's 
economic interests because of the political decisions being 
adopted by our leaders, what is your forecast of the state of 
the Russian Federation economy in the immediate future? 
  [Livshits] April and early May are a time for adopting 
urgent decisions on the reform. The economy can no longer drag 
the load of enterprises without prospects and hopeless debtors. 
It will strain itself. Unlike 1992, an attempt to save them by 
inflationary means will cost a monthly increase in prices at the 
level of 40-50 percent. This would be a real disaster. We have 
approached the threshold of crucial decisions comparable with 
those made at the end of 1991. We must cross it within the next 
few months: the implementation of the bankruptcy procedure, the 
organization of promissory note circulation, the new stage of 
privatization, the activation of Russian investors from the 
private sector, the reinstatement of the management of state 
enterprises, tough measures to strengthen financial discipline. 
  At present we are keeping monthly inflation down to 8-10 
percent. By the yardsticks of developed countries, this is very 
high. But by CIS yardsticks it is a record. Russia is now the 
only CIS state where the population's incomes grew faster than 
prices in the first quarter of 1994. The position of Russians 
as a whole is also better in terms of the absolute standard of 
living. In February 1994 it was possible to buy twice as much 
meat in Moscow on the average monthly Russian wage as on the 
average Belorussian wage in Minsk, and 32 times more than on the 
average Armenian wage in Yerevan. So there. 
  [Zamyatina] Preparations are under way in Russia for the 
parade of political forces scheduled for 1996. How do you rate 
the chances of the aspirants to the post of leader of the state? 
  [Livshits] If you were to ask the question, which of them is 
to be trusted, I would say: not those who covet power but those 
who know what to do with it later and how to turn it into 
something good for the country. 
  It cannot be ruled out that the political pendulum will move 
to the left. Not just because of miscalculations by reformers, 
who gave little thought to the costs of market transformations. 
The point is that there has always been a great reserve of 
social discontent in Russia. It still exists. Many people will 
be found who believe that the market processes are not going the 
way they should and result in unfair inequality. They will look 
for reasons and explanations. Not within themselves but in the 
social system and in bad power structures. This is the national 
tradition, and it will not be possible to break it. 
  The wave of discontent which raised up right-wingers in 
1991-1992 could well raise left-wingers in 1996. 
  This will be no tragedy if the reform of the economic 
mechanism makes serious progress in the next two years and the 
situation stabilizes. Maybe influential left-wing parties which 
have nothing to do with the CPSU will be formed during this 
time, and the voter will at last see that every communist is a 
left-winger, but not every left-winger is a communist. 
  At present there are still lots of things for conservative 
governments to do in the country. Only they are capable of 
completing the edifice of a market economy. When it is ready 
and starts to be filled with property, the time will come for 
some internal replanning. Left-wingers will have nothing to do 
at the summit of power until that which they will later share 
has been accumulated -- share in fairness or according to some 
other principle. 
  World practice unequivocally attests that the most 
intelligent socialist, if, of course, he firmly follows his own 
convictions, knows how to fight inflation far worse than the 
shabbiest conservative. 
  While there is no stability, the country needs a strong 
democratic power and a conservative, deideologized, professional 
government. Everything else is only harmful.
