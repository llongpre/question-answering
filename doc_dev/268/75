<LEADPARA>  NOT many years ago, Americans promoting family values and personal
responsibility seemed to be mostly conservative Republicans, TV evangelists
and a twice-married man with estranged children named Ronald Reagan.;   
Millions of middle-class baby boomers, whose attitudes more closely defined
the national mainstream, were occupied otherwise -- building careers, buying
things, moving away from their roots, ignoring their neighbors, forgetting to
vote, putting off parenthood, getting divorced.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Updated and refined values;  To many of them, "family values" was a code
phrase for a rigid, right-to-life, prayers-in-school, mom-in-the-kitchen
orthodoxy they couldn't embrace.;    But no more.;    Today an updated and
redefined sense of family values has moved to the very center of political and
social discourse, driven most of all by the dilemmas of moms who aren't in the
kitchen -- working women trying to balance the income, fulfillment and
obligations of work with the pleasure and responsibility of domestic life.;   
Questions about the stability of families are proving so difficult that issues
of family and personal responsibility will challenge domestic social agendas
for years to come.;    Already, they have begun to change some employers'
attitudes toward day care, family leave, workaholic schedules and other
matters of home vs. work.;    Liberals pay attention;  Governments at all
levels are trying to respond to calls for stronger child-support enforcement,
protection against spouse and child abuse, and more attention to the needs of
single parents, usually women, usually poor.;    Relatively liberal
politicians who once viewed old-style family-values issues with "inattention
or outright hostility," as family researcher David Blankenhorn says, now are
giving new-style family-values questions special attention, if only to find
potential keys for success in the 1992 elections.;    And social theorists
under the banner of "communitarianism" are seeing a need to enlarge our sense
of responsibility in everything from parenthood and divorce to drinking and
driving.;    Behind all this family- and community-oriented restlessness, this
search for ways to blend personal freedom and good behavior, is a resounding
fact of the 1990s:;    The 80 million baby-boom Americans who engineered the
country's three-decade experiment in liberation and individualism now are
paying lots of attention to matters of hearth and home.;    And ultimately,
the most enduring truth in the roller-coaster lives of those
27-to-45-year-olds might prove to lie not in the words of '60s
revolutionaries, '70s rock 'n' rollers or '80s ego-materialists. It might
trace back to the words of their own parents, repeated relentlessly over the
years:;    "Wait until you have children of your own.";    "The baby boom is
aging and having kids," public affairs specialist William Galston of the
University of Maryland says, "and both are powerful conservatizing factors."; 
  "It's certainly not something that should give comfort to traditional
liberalism," says Blankenhorn, who runs the family-research oriented Institute
for American Values in New York.;    "Nor should it give much comfort to
traditional conservatism. These people aren't going to send checks to Jerry
Falwell.";    They are going to do as before: take care of themselves and, by
extension, their kids. They already have produced a new generation of
middle-class baby-boomer cliches: the $300 stroller, the super-safe Volvo
station wagon, the day care obsession, the endless pursuit of "quality time.";
   Beyond that, social observers also detect a new level of neighborhood
concern and community involvement.;    Galston, a personal-responsibility
advocate who was issues director in Democrat Walter Mondale's 1984
presidential campaign, is his own best example. "I don't spend much time
worrying about my own safety," he says. "But I do worry now about the safety
of my young son. For myself, I don't really give a damn what's on television .
. . but I'm certainly concerned and not alone in my concern that it's shaping
young people.";    Social statistics further dramatize that ongoing
gravitation to children and family:;    (check) During each of the past five
years, people have tended to stay married more than at any time since the
early 1970s. That follows an upward trend in the national divorce rate that
began in the mid-1960s and peaked in 1979 at 5.3 divorces a year per 1,000
people. Since 1986, the rate has not exceeded 5.0 and has dropped as low as
4.7.;    Social historian Barbara Whitehead, who has done substantial
exploration of the lives of baby-boom families, expects that to continue. "One
of the great social experiments has been divorce, and the news of the effect
of divorce on children has been very sobering," she says. "Baby boomers take
themselves very seriously. . . . They will pay attention to that.";    (check)
At the same time, the national fertility rate -- the annual number of babies
born per 1,000 women of child-bearing age -- has climbed to about 75, a level
also not seen since the early 1970s. In raw numbers, as many children were
born last year as were born in some of the peak years of the baby boom -- more
than 4 million.;    Most baby-boom mothers now have their second child,
Whitehead says, adding, "A lot of this (turmoil) is growing out of their
experience with two children.";    (check) A huge proportion of people in the
baby-boom age group told Gallup Poll researchers in April that they expect
family to play a more important part of their lives in the next five years.
Among men, 91 percent said so; among women 84 percent.;    Fifty-one percent
of those men also said they expected to spend more time with their families in
the next five years, and so did 42 percent of the women.;    (check)
Apparently even more would if they could. Fifty-six percent of working women
questioned late in 1990 told Yankelovich Clancy Shulman pollsters that if they
didn't need the money, they would consider not working any more.;    What was
most remarkable about that figure was that it had risen from 38 percent only
one year before.;    "Very suddenly between 1989 and 1990, women changed the
emphasis on where they wanted to put their lives," says Susan Hayward, a
Yankelovich vice president. "We figured eventually something would have to
give, and in 1990, it did.";    Hayward says the wish for more time at home
was no different among women with children or without but adds, "We haven't
seen any great change in behavior yet," presumably because those women and
their families need their incomes too much.;    Their choice for the widest
range of opportunities and experiences has become a box, confining them and,
in the process, affecting the entire country.;    Women's studies scholar
Elizabeth Fox-Genovese of Emory University in Atlanta says, "I think this is
another stage in the women's movement and a recognition that women's issues
are social issues, broadly defined.";    And there are some political
stirrings.;    Congressional leaders on women's and family issues are pressing
for increased tax exemptions for families with children, more support for
child care, family leave statutes, greater protection for divorced and abused
women, and other such measures.;    Still, says Fox-Genovese, "It feels very
ephemeral to me. There is a big question whether it will translate into
policy.";    Some dream of swinging the social pendulum back toward more
stable times past. But if the people wrestling with matters of family and
society share one piece of history, it is that their generation rose up
against the generation that defined and defended the 1950s. Whatever happens,
Whitehead discards the idea of a pendulum swinging backward.;    "This new
familism is a set of questions . . . and we're going to have to wait for the
answers," she says. "But I don't think we'll completely throw out the cultural
revolution of the '60s and '70s."  </TEXT>
