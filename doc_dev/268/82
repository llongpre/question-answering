<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Bardial] </F>
  [Text] Luis Paulo Rosenberg told PAGINA 12: "If Lula [Luiz 
Inacio da Silva] wins the October presidential elections he will 
probably impose a style of government that is nearer to Mexico 
than to Argentina. He will dedicate more money to social 
programs; he will slow down the privatization process; and he 
will open up the economy and maintain a social balance." 
Rosenberg wrote a document entitled: "The PT [Workers Party] In 
Government," which has lately become something of a best seller 
among Brazilian businessmen, executives, and industrialists. 
  The authors spent three months researching the subject and 
published only 500 issues of the document on 31 May. It has 40 
pages and it sells for $100 among powerful Sao Paulo 
businessmen. Wladimir Pomar, former Lula campaign manager 
during the 1989 presidential election and current PT dissident, 
is one of the authors. 
  Rosenberg currently directs a private consulting firm in Sao 
Paulo. He was one of the advisers of controversial former 
Economy Minister Delfim Netto, one of the gray eminences of the 
so-called "Brazilian miracle" during the military regime 
(1964-83). 
  PAGINA 12 has had access to the document. It is based on 
the assumption that PT leader "Lula" will probably be elected 
president in October. To charge $100 dollars for something that 
almost everybody knows seems a bit steep, especially in light of 
surveys which in the past months have given the PT candidate 
nearly 40 percent of the vote, the highest among all candidates 
seeking to get to the Planalto Palace in Brasilia. Rosenberg's 
work, however, summarizes the history of the PT since its 
foundation in 1978. It analyzes relations among its diverse 
internal factions and presents a biographical-political profile 
of its main leaders, which makes it a Who's Who [previous two 
words in English] of essential reading for those who believe the 
future is fraught with dark "red" forecasts. 
  The book explains that the organization include movements 
from a broad spectrum of political positions: liberals, 
Christian socialists, social democrats, revolutionary 
socialists, Trotskyites, and ultras, who are known as "Shiites" 
due to their fundamentalist radicalism. The document stresses, 
however, that "within Lula's pendular system of politics, the 
center holds the balance." 
  Regarding military reaction, Rosenberg rules out any 
possibility of unrest in the barracks if Lula wins. "The Armed 
Forces will not interfere in the electoral process," he 
categorically states. 
  The Sao Paulo consultant believes sociologist Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, the former economy minister and presidential 
candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), who is 
currently second in the surveys, also has "a very good chance." 
The document states that this is the case even though he "has 
no charisma and his political campaign is somewhat amateurish." 
Rosenberg assumes Cardoso's economic plan will lower inflation 
and stresses that "Brazilian gratitude toward anyone who reduced 
inflation from 45 percent a month to 3 percent is bound to be 
enormous." 
  Lula proposes a pact between the government, entrepreneurs, 
and workers to lower the inflation rate. His plan contemplates 
strong state intervention in the economy, changes within the 
financial system, and measures such as price control and a fight 
against oligopolies. 
  Rosenberg gives no chance to Orestes Quercia of the 
Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) or Leonel Brizola, former Rio 
de Janeiro State governor of the Democratic Workers Party (PDT), 
who are the other presidential candidates. Rosenberg says the 
former "is unparalleled in his political professionalism and is 
a born winner, but his past is so full of corruption charges." 
Rosenberg briefly describes Brizola as "an unburied corpse." 
  Political scientist Francisco Weffort, one of the most 
brilliant minds within the PT, has explained the new winds -- or 
rather, the new breeze -- blowing through the organization. 
Tactics have changed since the 1982 election when the PT 
campaign slogan was: "Vote for number three, the rest are 
bourgeoisie." Lula's ballot number was three. 
  "The PT currently has a more open alliance policy than in 
the 
past," Weffort says. The PT "under Lula seeks alliances with 
entrepreneurs and the middle class, although not exclusively. 
He has done a good job in overcoming the mistrust of 
entrepreneurs, but Fernando Henrique Cardoso has more weight 
with them." 
  Weffort gave an example: "Making alliances is not easy. It 
is like getting married. It is not enough for one side to want 
it, the other side must want it too." Weffort said the PT 
"always wanted an alliance with the PDT, but Brizola speaks out 
against Lula almost every day." Weffort does not rule out a 
possible approach to Fernando Henrique Cardoso's party. 
  This possibility is not so very far fetched (in fact, the 
closer the date of the election, the more far fetched is 
everything else in this country, which is filled with apparent 
irrational political attitudes). Edmar L. Bacha, economist, 
academician, author of the plan that seeks to rescue Brazil from 
its high inflationary process, and Cardoso's assistant during 
his administration at the Economy Ministry expressed himself in 
similar terms last March: "Lula cannot govern alone. He will 
have to seek alliances." To avoid any doubts, he added: "PT 
deputies are very responsible and highly trained people. It is 
true that the party has many radicals at the grassroots, but 
there is nothing to prevent what we call the light [preceding 
word in English] PT faction prevailing once Lula is in 
government." 
  Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva usually listens to his advisers' 
proposals. The 21 members of the National Executive Committee 
participate in his campaign planning. Its most important 
members are: 

  -  Jose Graziano is an agronomist with a PhD from 
the University of London. He has listed the most serious 
problems that the PT must address. He carries a folder on 
important issues and advises the candidate on how to handle 
problems. 
  -  Ricardo Kotscho is a journalist. He is not a PT 
member; he is a public relations adviser. Those who know him 
well say he is "a propaganda producing machine" who specializes 
in special effects. 
  -  Wander Bruno do Prado is Lula's personal 
secretary. He organizes Lula's famous "caravans" throughout the 
country. He establishes the routes, the length, lunching 
places, hotels, and transportation 40 to 50 days in advance of 
each electoral tour. 
  -  Gilberto Carvalho is a former seminarist 
and employee of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops. 
It is said that very few people know better what each important 
religious figure thinks in the country. He is a close friend of 
Lula but has less influence than those listed above. He is 
Lula's main contact with the Church. 
  -  Hamilton Pereira is a 
former guerrilla and former political prisoner. He takes care 
of the candidate's engagements agenda. He is a poet who won the 
House of the Americas' prize with poems he wrote while in jail.
