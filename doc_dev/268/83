conditions inside the walls of state mental hospitals led to the movement --
begun in the idealistic 1960s and accomplished mostly in the cost-cutting '70s
and '80s -- to shut mental institutions down. The result, two recent books
assert, is that our streets have become the new Bedlams.;    They who vacantly
drooled tucked away unseen in hospitals years ago now drool right there on the
sidewalk, on church steps, at the entrance to movie theaters, inside
cash-machine alcoves and subway cars. The homeless shelter has replaced the
19th-century poorhouse, these critics say.;    But is deinstitutionalization
really the reason we have these urban zombies scavenging through trash cans,
begging for change and muttering to themselves?;    "Out of Bedlam" by Ann
Braden Johnson, a psychiatric social worker who is an experienced clinician
and a senior administrator, puts the issue in context. The fact that
deinstitutionalization saved the public money turned it into a cost-cutting
strategy rather than a humane and innovative way of treating the mentally
ill.;    Johnson distrusts bureaucrats and administrators who design and
implement programs for patients they never see. She has contempt for advocates
of the cheap fix. It shows in her chapter on psychotropic and anti-psychotic
drugs to keep patients in line. Often, they don't work and produce disabling
side effects.;    She provides solid reporting on the history of the
aggressive marketing campaign for Thorazine. Touted as a cheap way to keep
mental wards quiet, the drug was sold as the "chemical straitjacket," then
oversold as a substitute for ongoing outpatient care for the mentally ill.;   
"So now we're angry, because all those mental patients didn't become normal
and act like responsible citizens from the day of their discharge on," says
Johnson, taking on those who would swing the pendulum back toward lockup.;   
Blaming the do-gooders;    Yet, in the end, Johnson's book -- fair, reasoned,
moderate -- lacks the compelling polemic energy that drives "Madness in the
Streets," an often outrageous, unfair and provocative diatribe against those
reformers of the 1960s. Authors Rael Jean Isaac and Virginia C. Armat blame
the do-gooders for each and every wild-eyed wacko found muttering to himself
on the street.;    Citing one study after another -- and ignoring any studies
that suggest otherwise -- Isaac and Armat insist that the closing of the
mental institutions led directly to the influx of the homeless on our streets.
The authors seem to argue that most, if not all, the homeless are clinically
psychotic and deprived of a place to call home -- namely, a mental hospital --
because the reformers shut down the system with their overblown and misguided
concerns about human rights.;    Left unsaid by the authors: that the need to
pay for the Vietnam War narrowed the ambitions of the Great Society, forcing
the curtailment of the War on Poverty at the same time that mental
institutions were closing down.;    Isaac and Armat would put all the blame on
that evil decade -- the 1960s -- and its ideas of liberation and tolerance of
deviance. It was the decade of sociologist Erving Goffman, whose "Asylums" in
1960 looked at mental hospitals and argued that such "total institutions" were
so dehumanizing that they actually fostered the deviant behavior so often
identified as madness. It was the decade of Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest," in which mental-patient Murphy is the caring humanist and
Nurse Ratched the embodiment of the death of the soul.;    It was the decade
that spawned the Network Against Psychiatric Assault, which railed against the
use of electroshock treatment, lobotomy and psychotropic drugs -- all of which
Isaac and Armat favor.;    "The counterculture denied the very existence of
mental illness," the authors write. "The Left defined those stigmatized as
mentally ill as simply another oppressed group, like blacks, women, gays, who
should have freedom to pursue their alternative life style.";    Is it true
that the ideas of liberation actually helped enslave the mentally ill poor by
forcing them to fend for themselves on the streets? The authors never consider
the possibility that the growing numbers of homeless stem more from the
nation's failure to understand and take responsibility for the social
pathology of the underclass. They deride and dismiss as folly the advocates
who call for training programs, housing and jobs as the means of attack
against homelessness.;    The authors really get juiced up when they point at
the real villains of their story: "civil libertarian lawyers," who went to
court to close abusive institutions and secure rights for the involuntarily
committed: "Influenced by the campus rebellions of the 1960s . . . they
harbored strong anti-institution and anti-authority sentiments," Isaac and
Armat write. "More than any other single group, they have been responsible for
changing our laws governing civil commitment.";    Easy answers;    To their
credit, Isaac and Armat offer some alternatives to confinement. Nevertheless,
in summing up they are quick to seek the easy answers -- more long-term
commitment with fewer legal safeguards, and more drugging of mental patients.;
   And when it comes to assessing how we got where we are, they fail to hold
policy makers and politicians responsible for the mess we find ourselves in.; 
  While our leaders were so busy congratulating themselves for cutting costs
and shutting down these places of shame -- often after courts ordered them to
do so -- they failed to provide the safety net, an integrated system of local
mental health services, group homes and humane hospital care.  </TEXT>
