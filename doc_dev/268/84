<LEADPARA>  When Wall Street analysts look for reassurance that the economy is on the
right track toward recovery, many of them turn to the recent charts on
inflation.;    By all the evidence, the rebound in economic activity that
apparently began in late spring has been slow and fitful to date.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But even if it gathers momentum through the rest of the year, many
observers argue, it promises to proceed without an upsurge in the cost of
living that would threaten to cancel out its benefits.;    "As the pendulum
swings from an excess of debt creation during the '80s to de-leveraging in the
'90s, economic growth will be slow, but more soundly based," maintains Martin
Sass at the New York money management firm of M.D. Sass Investors Services.
"Inflation should be relatively tame in this environment.";    If you press
them for tangible reasons for their optimism, the inflation bulls point to
several recent trends.;    For one thing, they note, commodity prices have
fallen this year to not far above their lowest levels of the past decade or
more.;    The Commodity Research Bureau's index of commodity futures prices
"has historically been an excellent indicator of economic performance, as well
as a . . . gauge for identifying shifts in the direction of producer and
consumer prices," said Lacy Hunt, chief economist at Carroll McEntee &amp;
McGinley Inc.;    Another favorable portent, analysts say, has been slow
growth in various measures of the nation's money supply.;    Wall Streeters
also generally say they are pleased to see Alan Greenspan, with his image as a
staunch foe of inflation, set to return for a second four-year term as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.;    One piece that doesn't quite fit
the puzzle, however, is the persistent high level of long-term interest rates,
which suggests that bond traders are still dubious about the inflation
outlook.;    But the bond market's behavior actually supports the
low-inflation thesis, some argue, by acting as a restraint on any new outburst
of demand for credit.;    With talk like that to cheer it on, the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials rose 35.55 points to 3,016.32 in the past week.  </TEXT>
