FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts: Prurience or the pursuit of truth? - Biography is one
of the most popular literary forms. But, says Jackie Wullschlager, its days
may be numbered

WH Auden thought it should never have been written. The critic Dame Helen
Gardener called it 'a directory for consenting adults.' From the liberal
Bloomsbury Set came calls for wholesale suppression. But thousands of
readers lapped up its story of homosexual love and intrigue, and it changed
the face of post-war British biography.
The book was Michael Holroyd's life of Lytton Strachey, first published in
1967 and re-issued, with much new material, next week. It is still a
marvellous read, and its fresh crop of sexual details - chiefly about the
amorous triangle of Strachey and artists Dora Carrington and Mark Gertler -
continue to interest. But this time round Holroyd's revelation will barely
raise an eyebrow, because the liberal biographical climate which the book
engendered in the 1960s has now become the norm.
No book since Strachey's own Eminent Victorians in 1918 has had a greater
effect on the way we interpret and reconstruct past lives, and to trace the
joint influence of Strachey and Holroyd on modern biography is to trace a
revolution both in our attitudes to sex and to art, as in our growing
fixation on the private lives of public figures. Is the tradition they began
still a liberating force in British culture, or has it now gone too far?
In 1918 Strachey blew the whistle on the earnest, tip-toeing Victorian style
of biography with his sarcastic account of 19th century icons such as
Florence Nightingale and General Gordon. Half a century on, Holroyd's
biography of Strachey turned the tables on the Bloomsbury writer, bringing
to the surface methods of interpretation which Strachey's malicious purring
had only implied. Discussing Strachey's affair with Duncan Grant, the madcap
proposal to Virginia Woolf - 'I was in terror lest she should kiss me' - and
the effect of schoolboy crushes on his neurotic experiences, Holroyd showed
that a full picture of an individual could only be drawn if it included
intimate details, the inner life as well as the output achievement. 'Rather
wonderful and terrible how all that can now be said,' wrote Nancy Mitford of
the book.
Modern literary publishing for good and ill, has never looked back. On the
one hand, Holroyd's spirit of openness and his elegant novelistic style,
burst the floodgates of biographical restraint and made biography a popular,
best-selling genre. Its highlights include some of the best books of the
last 30 years, such as Richard Ellmann's life of Oscar Wilde, Victoria
Glendinning's Trollope, Lyndall Gordon's Charlotte Bronte - all exquisite
accounts of the personal lives of writers within the context of their work
and times.
On the other hand, many recent books suggest that the post 1960s tradition
of tolerant, revealing biography is entering a last, decadent phase in which
all that matters is an artist's sex life. Extended speculation on the sexual
habits of Hardy and his second wife, for example, made Martin Seymour
Smith's massive scholarly biography of the writer, published this year, a
joke. Recent lives of Picasso and Brecht chronicled their lovers rather than
their work. And as new biographical subjects run out, lives of wives and
girlfriends - Lawrence's women, Madox Ford's lover, Flaubert's mistress -
replaced them, licensing pages of dull pillow talk. Where Holroyd or Ellmann
made biography an art form, the tail end of their tradition is degenerating
into vulgar tittle-tattle.
It is no coincidence that Holroyd and Ellmann's masterpieces are both about
homosexual satirists, Strachey and Wilde, who spent their lives trying to
change social and sexual attitudes. Strachey and Wilde's homosexual affairs,
outre poses, the flirtation with scandal marked them as outsiders and were
bound up with the mockery of repressive convention in their works such as
Eminent Victorians and The Importance of Being Earnest. As sexual pioneers,
their biographies cried out for a link between life, art and the wider
social panorama, and it is this which makes Holroyd's Strachey and Ellmann's
Wilde so entertaining and significant.
But take away this dimension, and catalogue Florence Hardy's efforts to
stimulate her ageing husband, or Picasso's pick-ups, and you are left with a
dull quasi-pornographic record masquerading as a serious book. For what
makes sex on the page subversive and interesting is social context. FR
Leavis used to tell his students that Strachey was responsible for the
outbreak of the second world war; Paul Johnson has argued that by destroying
patriotism, Strachey created a national emptiness which became the
homosexual recruiting ground at Cambridge for Soviet espionage.
It was these sort of links between culture and sexuality that made Holroyd's
1967 biography so inflammatory. In 1994, Holroyd's new material centres on
Dora Carrington, Strachey's adoring companion, and the second half of the
book is now also a biography of her. She attracted to their home the sort of
virile, charismatic young men that Strachey loved and married one of them to
ensure that their menage continued. Eventually, she wrote, a lesbian affair
'killed my desires for Les Jeunes Garcons pretty completely,' and when
Strachey died, she shot herself.
This tumultous tale has much gloss and few social reverberations, and is the
weakest part of the book. But so fashionable have flamboyant private lives
like Carrington's become for their own sake, that this new section has
immediately been seized upon to enter 1990s mainstream culture; a film,
Carrington, directed by Christopher Hampton, starring Emma Thompson and
Jonathan Pryce, is to be made of it and will open next spring. Nothing shows
more clearly the revolution in our attitude to private lives that Strachey's
and Holroyd's work has effected this century.
Strachey first weaved sex into cultural criticism - of Virginia Woolf's To
the Lighthouse, he complained that 'It is the lack of copulation that
worries me' - at a time when it was radical and provocative to do so. Now
the pendulum has swung the other way, and our culture goes so far as to
judge public or artistic achievement by private affairs, hence the
biographies which dismiss Picasso's painting or Brecht's plays because their
creators were irresponsible in bed, or the lives of Flaubert's and Madox
Ford's lovers, which accord their subjects artistic status because they
slept with great writers.
Since Lytton Strachey appeared in 1967, there have always been those keen to
curb this prurient interest - from a Spectator article in 1968, warning that
fears of Stracheyesque indiscretion would lead potential biographical
subjects to destroy letters and journals, to the Lord Chancellor's 1993
consultation paper on The Infringement of Privacy, which recommended
restriction of published material causing 'substantial stress, to relatives
or descendants'.
For the biographer, this form of censorship would be disastrous. But
contemporary biography is more endangered by its own decadent trends towards
sex'n'shopping lives than by outside restrictions. The new edition of
Holroyd's classic biography (Chatto Pounds 25, 780 pages) looks as bright
and undated as if it were written this morning - a tribute to its style and
insight, but also a comment on the fact that no new biographical tradition
has emerged since the 1960s. Where is the Michael Holroyd, or indeed the
Lytton Strachey, for the 21st century?
