Calling it "an interesting and difficult question," a federal judge Wednesday 
refused to rule immediately on the legality of electronic surveillance used by 
the FBI during its undercover investigation of alleged fraud at Chicago's two 
major commodity exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by John F. Grady, chief judge of the Northern District of 
Illinois, left the door open for lawyers eventually to contest the 
admissibility of evidence gathered by "human bugs" -- electronically outfitted 
FBI agents working undercover in the trading pits of the Chicago Board of Trade 
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Civil liberties lawyer Burton Joseph said Grady's language suggested that the 
judge believed "the argument is far from frivolous and merits serious 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Criminal lawyers representing many of the traders called before the special 
grand jury hearing the government's case believe that the challenge to the 
recorded evidence could undermine the unprecedented government investigation of 
commodity futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
Former federal prosecutors Susan Bogart and Stephen J. Senderowitz filed the 
novel challenge on behalf of three traders subpoenaed in the probe. They 
contend that this type of electronic monitoring, where ambient conversations 
are overheard, requires judicial authorization. Apparently, the government did 
not have that authorization when FBI agents recorded conversations on the 
trading floors. 
</P>
<P>
If prior judicial approval was necessary before the wired agents went into the 
trading pits, Joseph and other lawyers said, much of the government's evidence 
in this investigation could be tainted and unusable. 
</P>
<P>
Grady did not address that question in his ruling. Instead, he said it was the 
wrong time to file the challenge because Bogart's and Senderowitz's clients, 
who were not identified by name, had not yet appeared before the grand jury. If 
they do appear and are cited for contempt for refusing to answer questions, 
Grady wrote, then the legality of the electronic surveillance can be 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Bogart said an appeal of Grady's Wednesday decision was being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
While the challenge was heard in secret last week -- and all the proceedings 
except Grady's eight-page decision remain secret -- the ruling provided 
additional insight into the government's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The judge wrote that the three traders represented by Senderowitz and Bogart 
"have indicated that, should they appear before the grand jury, they intend to 
invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Grady wrote, "the court sees no reason to decide the 
electronic surveillance question as a mere academic exercise."
