FT  16 FEB 93 / Trouble with the neighbours: Latin America fears a less
productive relationship with the new US administration

As Bill Clinton settles into the White House, Latin American governments are
worried that once again, US policy towards them is taking an unpredictable
turn. They often characterise American attitudes as a pendulum swinging from
crisis to neglect. Relations have been more consistent - generally bad.
One of George Bush's achievements as president was the improvement of
relations with most neighbouring governments. His decision to negotiate a
free trade area with Mexico and to open the prospect of free trade with the
rest of the region through the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was
applauded by Latin governments.
'For us, the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was the most important
initiative from the US in 30 years,' says Mr Alieto Guadagni, Argentina's
secretary for international economic relations.
In contrast, from the Latin American perspective, the Clinton administration
has started badly. Governments are worried by the protectionist signals
coming from Washington just as they are seeking to expand exports.
They were also disappointed by the choice of Mr Mario Baeza, a black
Cuban-American lawyer with little experience of the region, as nominee for
the job of assistant secretary for Latin American affairs in the State
Department. They became more concerned when Mr Baeza was dropped under
pressure from the Florida-based anti-Castro lobby on the grounds that he
might be too soft on President Fidel Castro. 'It looks as if the only Latin
Americans who matter to Clinton are the Miami Cubans,' says one academic.
If the pendulum is swinging towards neglect, as Latin American leaders fear,
there are dangers. Mr William Leogrande, politics professor at the American
University in Washington, says Latin America's problems should be addressed
now 'before they become such extraordinary crises that all the policy
options left are bad ones'.
Talk of crisis contrasts sharply with the enthusiasm that has suffused
Washington and Wall Street over the past two or three years about the
region's prospects.
The excitement was in part justified by the transformation of the political
and economic map of Latin America during the 1980s. Elected governments,
rather than military dictatorships, are now installed almost everywhere in
the region. These governments have opened their economies to foreign trade
and capital in the belief that the closed, state-controlled economies
favoured by their predecessors were largely to blame for the debt-induced
recession of the 1980s.
Economic reforms - aimed at revitalising the market through such measures as
privatisation and openness to foreign investment - yielded higher growth and
lower inflation in most countries.
But by last year expectations appeared to have run ahead of reality. Says Mr
Victor Bulmer-Thomas, head of the Institute for Latin American Studies at
the University of London: 'If we compare where Latin America is now with,
say, two years ago, it's actually in a very satisfactory position. If people
are now beginning to get depressed, it's because expectations were built up
far too high.'
Events of the past 12 months have also reasserted some of the region's
perennial problems: authoritarianism, corruption and political violence.
There have been two military coup attempts in Venezuela, the suspension of
the constitution in Peru, the impeachment of the president on corruption
charges in Brazil and the declaration of a state of emergency in Colombia,
where the government faces an intensifying struggle against left-wing
guerrillas and drugs traffickers.
On the economic front, too, some of the region's success stories have
started to look less secure. Mexico, for example, faces the growing problem
of financing a current account deficit of Dollars 20bn, equivalent to 6 per
cent of gross domestic product.
With the euphoria punctured, capital inflows into the region, look set to
decline. According to J P Morgan, the New York bank, the flow of private
capital into the region is expected to drop this year to Dollars 23bn from
an estimated Dollars 44bn last year.
These developments have uncovered tensions created by the simultaneous
attempt to transform political and economic systems. Mr Abraham Lowenthal,
director of the Centre for International Studies at the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles, says the region's shifts are important
but 'they are not yet deeply rooted'.
Reforms are often implemented by a few senior government officials, and
opposed by influential groups such as the military, the bureaucracy, trade
unions, political parties and local industrialists who thrived behind the
old tariff walls. Their positions are threatened by the decentralisation of
power that can result from both political reform - through a more effective
popular democracy - and from economic reform, which deprives the state of
influence, for example through privatisation.
Furthermore, the economic reforms are seen, sometimes justly, as
accentuating already-wide income disparities. Two out of five Latin
Americans live in poverty - 180m people compared with 130m in 1980. The
wealthiest fifth of the population earn 20 times that earned by the poorest
fifth, compared with less than 10 times in Asia.
Economic reform has not been unpopular everywhere. In Argentina, for
instance, the ending of hyperinflation and the opening of the economy has
bolstered the authority of President Carlos Menem. People have been given
access to cheaper consumer goods
and so far have responded by supporting the government.
But sooner or later, the piper has to be paid by increasing exports. 'The
model is one of export-led growth; the problem is that in most countries
exports have yet to take off,' says Mr Bulmer-Thomas.
The difficulties in increasing exports are compounded, however, where the
exchange rate is allowed to appreciate in real terms as part of the attempt
to fight inflation. This appreciation, a problem both for Mexico and
Argentina, makes imports progressively more competitive against
home-produced goods. It widens the current account deficit and hurts
domestic industry.
In Mexico, vanguard of the region's economic reform movement, some
economists think that only further aggressive deregulation will rid the
economy of its bottlenecks - its bad roads and ports, inefficient
bureaucracy and corrupt law enforcement - to allow it successfully to
compete on a international level.
Such reforms will take time, and time may be in short supply. Important
clues to the durability of economic reform will be given in the next two
years as an intense period of presidential election activity starts. This
year, presidential elections are scheduled in Paraguay in May, in Bolivia in
June, and in Venezuela and Chile in December.
The elections will highlight the tensions between democracy, economic reform
and the power of entrenched interests throughout the region. And while Mr
Clinton cannot determine the outcome of events in Latin America, he can be
an important influence.
His campaign speeches suggested more emphasis on promoting democracy, which
he argued should be the motivating force behind US foreign policy in the
post cold-war period. His approach to drugs trafficking - particularly if it
focuses on curbing demand in the US rather than on pouring more resources
into interdiction in producing countries - may prove more constructive than
that of Mr Bush.
But the most important question-mark is over trade, and the new
administration's attitudes to the Uruguay Round trade talks and to the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, negotiated last year
and due before the legislatures of the three countries this year for
ratification. Mr Clinton has declared himself in favour of Nafta, though he
wants some side agreements with Mexico that would protect American jobs and
ensure Mexico does not suck in investment because of lower environmental
standards. However, the Democratic party is divided over the agreement and
Mr Clinton may be deterred from submitting it to Congress for quick
ratification.
'The rejection of Nafta at this stage would be a decisive setback. It would
deal a severe blow to Mexico's economic reform efforts and strain US-Mexico
relations. It would also gut the core of future hemisphere-wide trade
relations,' says the InterAmerican Dialogue, a Washington-based study group
in a report published last month.
Without Nafta, the most potent, tangible expression of closer, more
constructive US-Latin relations would be jeopardised. Securing the real
gains made over the past few years and preventing a resurgence of
authoritarianism and economic nationalism in Latin America would become more
difficult.
