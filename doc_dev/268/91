   General director Ardis Krainik is steering the
Lyric Opera of Chicago into the 21st century, and she feels the way
to reach the wild blue yonder is to stay in the black.
   Once again this year, the woman who told Luciano Pavarotti his
services were no longer needed in Chicago has come up with an
operatic marvel rarer than a superstar tenor. It's called solvency.
   ``We haven't had a deficit since 1981, and for the second year
in a row our entire season was sold out by opening night,'' Lyric
spokeswoman Susan Mathieson said. ``Our ticket sales will top $11
million. Our fund-raising goal for the year is $7.95 million, and
we're right on target for that, too.''
   The current eight-opera season at Lyric, which began Sept. 14,
is the first of a decade-long initiative Miss Krainik has dubbed
``Toward the 21st Century.'' It's a program meant to showcase
often-overlooked 20th century operatic works, reshape productions
of more traditional operas and - most importantly - point the way
to the future.
   That future, as Miss Krainik sees it, is ``our own, unique
American opera, not just a hashed-over European art form.''
   Chicago's first taste of what such opera might be came Oct. 27,
when Lyric presented its first production of Minnesota composer
Dominick Argento's 1976 work, ``The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe.''
   Although Argento's hallucinatory opera had been performed
before, both in the United States and Europe, it had never received
a full-scale production in a major house until Miss Krainik hired
Pulitzer Prize-winning director Frank Galati to realize it on the
Lyric stage.
   The opening night audience greeted ``Poe'' with wild applause
and multiple curtain calls - an enthusiastic response for a complex
tale filled with death, madness and suggestions of necrophilia.
   Appropriately, ``Poe'' was still running over Halloween, and the
timing reflects the canny Krainik strategy that has sold out the
3,564-seat Civic Opera House for every performance in recent years.
That strategy mixes innovation, superstar vehicles and old
favorites.
   The 1990 season began with soprano Jessye Norman's Chicago
debut, which came in a work so old it was new - Gluck's 1767
``Alceste.'' The 18th century music was juxtaposed against Robert
Wilson's ultramodern set designs and costumes, the first production
he had done for an American opera house.
   ``Alceste'' caused grumbling among some audience members, who
complained of the lack of English-language supertitles that have
become standard under Miss Krainick's management.
   All other Lyric productions this season have supertitles,
including ``Poe,'' which is sung in English.
   After ``Alceste,'' Lyric's season moved to the mid-19th century
sumptuousness of Tchaikovsky's ``Eugene Onegin'' and on into the
early 20th century with Puccini's ``Girl of The Golden West.'' The
Puccini work gave tenor Placido Domingo a chance to revel in the
spaghetti Western role of ``Johnson di Sacramento'' and to romance
the keeper of the Polka Saloon.
   Then came ``Poe,'' complete with premature burial, a pendulum
and a Masque of the Red Death.
   ``Red's not a color we like around here, financially, but it's
fine for costumes,'' Ms. Mathieson commented.
   The rest of Lyric's 1990-91 season is more traditional fare.
``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' ``Rigoletto'' and ``Carmen'' will span the
Thanksgiving-to-Christmas period, and a reworking of its acclaimed
1985-6 ``The Magic Flute'' will appear in January.
   Miss Krainik has not announced the 1991-2 portion of ``Toward
the 21st Century,'' but she says composer William Bolcom is
preparing ``McTeague,'' an operatic version of Frank Norris' 1899
naturalistic novel as the centerpiece of the 1992-3 season.
``McTeague'' is to be staged by film director Robert Altman, who
will be tackling the same material Erich Von Stroheim used for his
silent movie epic ``Greed.''
   The 1992-3 season also will feature the beginning of an even
more ambitious project, a remounting of Richard Wagner's monumental
``Ring'' cycle. Zubin Mehta is scheduled to conduct one of the four
``Ring'' operas each season until 1996. The entire cycle is to be
performed again in the spring of that year.
   Miss Krainik says world premieres of two other operas will occur
in the 1996-7 and 1999-2000 seasons - and both will be by American
composers.
   It's a major departure from the views of Miss Krainik's late
predecessor, Lyric founder Carol Fox, whose predilection for
European works and singers earned the Chicago company the nickname
of ``La Scala West.''
   Miss Fox's idea of a tribute to the U.S. Bicentennial was to
commission Polish composer Kryzystof Penderecki and British
playwright Christopher Fry to do an operatic version of John
Milton's ``Paradise Lost.'' That work had its premiere two years
late, in 1978, with sets designed to fit the stage of Milan's La
Scala, not Chicago.
   ``Paradise Lost'' cost a reported $2 million and added to the
sea of red ink that threatened to drown Lyric by 1980. In that
year, Lyric's board persuaded the ailing Miss Fox to step down
after 26 years and elevated Miss Krainik, who had been artistic
director since 1975.
