   Arthur Clarke also predicts a new kind of pit stops for tiring
athletes during a game. Like mechanics swarming over a racing car,
trainers will swarm over the tired performer, test his blood, inject
the nutrients running low and send him back, refueled, to the fray.
   Humanity will travel fastest in the spaceships of the next
century but there is a reasonable chance it will travel farthest by
a different route, learning. Anyone with a home computer terminal
may be linked through computer networks to the wisdom of the ages,
to the great libraries and universities of the world. Students
hemispheres apart could listen to and question a lecturer in Oxford,
England. A ghetto high school in Harlem could be wired into the same
gathered knowledge enriching Groton.
   Togetherness will be strained to its outer limits. Four
generations alive at the same time in the same family will be
common. Within a family, computers and cable TV will make it
unneccesary to leave home to work, go to school, church, take in a
movie or concert, shop, reserve an airline ticket, place an
off-track bet or do any number of things together at the risk of
claustrophobia or fratricide.
   By or in the next century, it is expected that spacecraft from
Earth will have visited every planet except the distant Pluto; the
United States will build a permanent base on the moon; space
stations will be transmitting solar energy to Earth.
   There are also those who predict that robotized space factories
could be run from Earth with only occasional visits by human
technicians. Others consider the ultimate solution to prison
overcrowding: sentence them to jails in space. Some think there will
be human migrations of religious groups seeking a war-free society
and another Plymouth Rock out there.
   And least charming was the notion projected by the movie, ``Blade
Runner,'' in which all the earth becomes a miserable ghetto after a
nuclear war. The rich flee to the suburbs of space. Earth is left to
the poor.
   So far neither American nor Soviet space ships have found any
sign of life out there. Certainly not a trace of ``Ming, the
Merciless'' or other sinister folks Buck Rogers and Captain Video
used to battle, when we were young, with opticon scillometers and
cosmic ray vibrators not yet invented.
   Huge audiences were invited to ``live a million could-be years
over a thousand maybe worlds.'' Then and now, writers of fiction
could not be discounted in the march of prophecy. Edgar Allan Poe
wrote about crossing the Atlantic in a balloon 134 years before one
did; Edward Everett Hale, about an orbiting satellite 88 years
before sputnik; Jules Verne, about a man on the moon 100 years
before Neil Armstrong.
   Others did less well. In 1894, an obscure socialist named King
Camp Gillette wrote about a utopia in which most of the people of
North America lived in 40,000 cooperative skyscrapers near Niagara
Falls. Ultimately, Gillette did better as a capitalist by inventing
the safety razor.
   Sunday supplements bulged with cities of the future _ towering
buildings, bright and widely spaced, helicopters flitting between
them, separate serene streets for vehicles and pedestrians, traffic
moving in a majestic flow, industry sharply zoned, cities ringed by
a rich greenbelt of bucolic farms and parks.
   Among the designs that never got off the drawing board were
amphibious battleships, flying tanks and troop carriers that would
tunnel through mountains; a Ford Thunderbird to be called the
``Nucleon'' and powered by a nuclear reactor in the trunk; an
airliner that would carry 20 engines, six ``in reserve,'' 451
passengers, a crew of 155, including a librarian, gymnast, two
maitres d', two masseuses, two wine stewards, seven musicians and
nine bar stewards.
   H.G. Wells thought World War I was the last war; Herbert Hoover
thought the Depression was over in 1930; Louis B. Mayer was told,
``no Civil War picture ever made a nickel'' and thus passed up
``Gone with the Wind''; Congress considered closing the Patent
Office in 1900 because everything the country needed had already
been invented.
   Closing out the 19th century, The New York Times said the future
of democracy appeared bright and, with the fall of Napoleon, the
world appeared safe from dictators.
   On that New Year's Day, the Times exulted on the front page.
``The Century is dead; long live the Century!'' One wonders, with
awe, if a new century made one exclamation mark fit to print, what
will a whole new millennium bring?
