   Israeli analysts trace the reconciliation of
Yasser Arafat and President Hafez Assad of Syria to Assad's desire
for more influence in Israeli-occupied lands and the PLO chief's
need for Syrian help in Lebanon.
   If the Arab rivals settle their differences the results would be
more violence against Israel, isolation of Jordan and the end of
the U.S. peace plan for the Middle East, already criticized by both
Israelis and Arabs, the analysts predicted.
   One said he did not expect the reconciliation to last because
distrust between Arafat and Assad ``is so profound.''
   The two met on Monday in Damascus, capital of Syria. Syrian and
Palestinian sources said they discussed the U.S. peace plan and the
Arab rebellion that began nearly five months ago in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   It was Arafat's first visit to Damascus since Syria expelled him
June 24, 1983, during a mutiny against his leadership by PLO
factions backed by Assad.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel's response to the
meeting would be to heighten its alert along its borders and in the
West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   Since the rebellion in the territories began Dec. 8,
Palestinians have tried 11 times to enter Israel from Lebanon. In
the latest attempt Tuesday, two Israeli soldiers and three
guerrillas were killed.
   ``Whenever you have an Arab consensus, it will always be
directed against the security of Israel,'' Shamir said on Israel
radio. ``Therefore, we have to be vigilant.''
   According to the analysts, the reconciliation effort was
prompted by Assad's desire for more influence in the occupied
territories, where most Palestinians support the Palestine
Liberation Organization, and by Arafat's need for free movement for
his fighters in Lebanon.
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the main power
broker in a nation factionalized by 13 years of civil war.
   A significant element in Arafat's decision was the weakening of
his mainstream Fatah movement by the assassination April 16 of his
deputy Khalil Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, military analyst
Zeev Schiff said in an interview.
   Wazir, who was buried in Damascus last week, was popular with
both Arafat loyalists and pro-Syrian PLO dissidents.
   Israeli sources have said Israeli commandos killed Wazir, but
the government has not acknowledged it.
   ``The Abu Jihad killing hurt Arafat's supporters and may have
been an impetus for this meeting,'' said Schiff, a correspondent
for the daily Haaretz. ``Arafat wants to appear more radical. This
meeting shows the PLO leader is like a pendulum, moving from one
position to another.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said either Syria or the PLO must
compromise if an alliance was to be achieved and Assad would not
moderate his position.
   Instead, ``the Syrians will demand from him (Arafat) extreme
positions that will pull him away from Jordan, from Egypt,'' Rabin
predicted on Israel television.
   Yossi Olmert, a Middle East specialist at Tel Aviv University,
said a PLO-Syrian alliance probably would isolate King Hussein of
Jordan because he is more moderate than Assad and willing to
discuss solutions to the Middle East conflict.
   Olmert said the meeting also was bad news for the United States.
   ``This is the last nail in the coffin of the U.S. peace
proposal,'' he said. ``It's yet another insurmountable difficulty
for Secretary of State (George P.) Shultz, at least at this
juncture.''
   In predicting the Arafat-Assad alliance would collapse, he said:
``The PLO and Syria ... both want to keep pressure on Israel from
the territories and from Lebanon, and they both are not eager to
make concessions for peace.
   ``But even though we see them kissing now, at the end of the day
Syrian suspicion of the PLO and PLO distrust of Syria is so
profound that I can't see how it can last.''
   He and others predicted the short-term impact of the
Arafat-Assad meeting would be negative.
   ``The `Sulha in Damascus' will fuel further unrest in the
territories,'' correspondent Uzi Machnaimi wrote in the daily
Yediot Ahronot, using the Arabic word for a reconciliation meeting.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands applauded the meeting.
   ``We Palestinians have been waiting for this moment,'' said
Elias Freij, a Palestinian Christian who favors Jordan and is mayor
of Bethlehem.
   Former Mayor Bassam Shakaa of Nablus said: ``The PLO-Syrian
reconciliation will double the power of the uprising. The fighting
spirit of the Palestinians will soar.''
