<LEADPARA>  IF YOU'RE looking for a thought-provoking afternoon, dust off the mental
cobwebs for a talk with Fred Jueneman of Newark.;    Unofficially known as
Newark's Renaissance man, Fred glides through a spectrum of subjects from
Egyptian mythology to chemical decompositions on Venus to dissection of the
score of the Broadway musical "Cats." But be prepared. He's as facile and
quick with his mind as a gymnast hurling and leaping through air.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     An inveterate reader, Jueneman never left the childhood phase of asking
"Why?" He has spent his life seeking answers to that question and others like:
"What if?" It is a way of thinking, he says, that requires practice.;    "I
like taking common ideas and turning them inside out," says Jeuneman, now
retired after 35 years as an analytical chemist for FMC Corp., where he
developed analysis methods for contaminates, trained technicians and revised
the company's "cookbook" of standard testing methods.;    His inquisitiveness
has found him fame.;    He has led seminars and written for a number of
scientific publications. He's in his 20th year of writing the "Innovative
Notebook," a column that allows him to speculate on almost any subject and
appears in Research and Development magazine.;    The column developed after
Jeuneman wrote a 10-part critique of a book by the magazine's then
editor/publisher.;    When the editor/publisher wrote back, saying Fred had
fascinating ideas, and offered him a column, Fred says "I couldn't fumble for
my pen fast enough to say yes." In his writings, Jeuneman has pitted himself
against well-known science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The two wrote for
Analog magazine, in a special edition on Immanuel Velikovsky. Velikovsky
contended in his 1950 book, "Worlds in Collision" that a close encounter
between Earth and Venus occurred during ancient, recordable history and
scientifically accounts for many of the miraculous events described in the Old
Testament and other ancient literature.;    Venus, according to Velikovsky,
was a comet-like body that was ejected from Jupiter and nearly collided with
Earth, causing gravitational effects and electromagnetic exchanges between the
planets that led to changes in polarity and affected the Earth's axial spin.; 
  Jeuneman prides himself on championing the underdogs like Velikovsky, whom
Asimov portrayed as a crackpot.;    "I'd give my eye teeth to learn the bulk
chemistry of the planets," he says. "It would tickle my chemical synapses.";  
 Though he has found fame, Jeuneman says the big fortunes that he once had
hoped his ideas might bring have eluded him. He still has a drawer full of
ideas developed from his six years with a small inventors' group.;    Though
they came up with a number of toys, the inventors put their highest hope on a
simple, but challenging toy made from a stick about seven inches long that is
held in the hand with two lemon-sized balls that dangle on fishing line about
eight inches. The challenge is to move the stick in one hand in a way to get
the balls to bounce against each other, under and then over the stick. It was
a toy that predated the "Klackers." The toy earned the inventors group an
audience with Wham-O. When the company wasn't interested, Jeuneman and his
partners test marketed 1,000 of "Them Things," as they called the stick and
ball game.;    "It was a marvelous experiment in business," he says.;   
Afterward, he concluded that he has "no business acumen at all." Jeuneman says
he's finally down to the last five or six of the toys stored somewhere in his
garage.;    Though big fortunes have eluded him, he maintains an enthusiastic
outlook, wide-eyed and inquisitive, spending as much time as possible these
days on writing music, an interest nearly neglected the past quarter of a
century.;    A graduate of San Francisco State University in music theory and
composition, he laughs when he says he spent his working career "conducting"
experiments.;    Now that he's retired, he's making up for lost time when he
isn't serving as the official video photographer for Newark Days, working with
the Newark Arts Council or attending one of the many committees on which he
serves.;    Jeuneman, who also serves on the Fremont-Newark Philharmonic
board, spent the holidays writing 220 pages of orchestral score for the "Waltz
Macabre" and the "Polonaise Fantasie," which he based on the Edgar Allan Poe
short story, "Masque of the Red Death.";    He describes his music as
traditional, the Polonaise taking one of its themes from Dvorak's First Piano
Quintet, with adaptions. Almost undetectable in the Waltz Macabre is a
variation of "Chopsticks.";    Almost all music can be traced from other
musicians, Jeuneman says. Musicians then adapt what they hear to their own
style. The musical theme in "Memory," from the Broadway musical, "Cats," can
be traced to a Gregorian chant "Dies Irae," he says.;    "In music, we have
all the structure and form that we have in the science. When you've mastered
these wonderful structural forms, then you're allowed, no, you're encouraged
to break the rules. There aren't many educators in sciences that could handle
that kind of an approach." Mastery of the accepted form, coupled with his bent
toward the unconventional, contributes to making Jeuneman a Renaissance man.; 
  But nothing is more important than a person's outlook, he says. "These are
the good ol' days." As you leave his study, jammed with books, magazines and
papers, the words of Henry David Thoreau, can be seen on the wall. They seem
to capture Jeuneman's zest for living: "None are so old as those who have
outlived enthusiasm."  </TEXT>
