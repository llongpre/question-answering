<HEAD>Real Traders Enliven Movie Set In Soybean Pit</HEAD>

   Four and a half years in the Chicago Board of Trade's U.S.
Treasury bond pit have taught Tom White that the popular image of
futures traders as overnight millionaires is a myth.
   Two days of playing a soybean trader in the upcoming film comedy
``Limit Up'' convinced White that his own perception of Hollywood
movie-making was also at odds with reality.
   Instead of glitter and glamor, White and 13 other real-life
traders from Chicago, who were recruited to add authenticity to the
production, found the experience downright tedious.
   ``You're filming 10 percent of the time and 90 percent of the
time you're standing around waiting for them to set the cameras and
lights,'' White said.
   And those lights were hot.
   ``I was sweating more than I do in the pit I trade in every
day,'' the 29-year-old independent trader said last week during a
break from the hectic pace of the T-bond arena.
   ``Hot'' also could describe the group's performance as soybean
traders whipped into a buying frenzy by rumors of a large Soviet
grain purchase, said director Richard Martini, a Chicago-area
native who also wrote the screenplay for ``Limit Up.''
   ``It just electrified everyone in the company,'' Martini, 33,
said in a telephone interview from the set on the trading floor of
the old Pacific Stock Exchange building in Los Angeles.
   ``The actors were incredibly impressed with their energy and
what these guys do,'' Martini said. ``Some of these guys who came
out here had traded together for 25 years and you just can't get
that from Hollywood.''
   Martini's older brother Robert, a former CBOT trader who served
as a consultant on the production, said the realistically raucous
trading scenes drew wild applause from onlookers.
   ``All sorts of heavyweights were coming over to the set,'' he
said. ``They'd never seen anything like it.''
   The attention was welcomed by White, who said he went to
Hollywood harboring a fantasy of being discovered.
   ``I'm available any time for any other production for any
film,'' he said. ``I'd gladly trade spots.''
   Martini's previous credits include the screenplay for the 1987
comedy ``Three For The Road'' and ``Can't Hurry Love,'' a 1988
release that he wrote and directed.
   ``Limit Up'' stars Nancy Allen, Dean Stockwell, ``Saturday Night
Live'' alumni Brad Hall and Danitra Vance, and Ray Charles. The
movie is being produced by Management Company Entertainment Group
Inc. and is scheduled for release next spring, said MCEG spokesman
Al Newman.
   The movie's title refers to a sharp upward move in the price of
a commodity traded on a futures exchange. Exchanges usually limit
the amount that prices can move in either direction.
   Martini said Miss Allen plays a low-level employee of a trading
company at the fictitious Midwest Grain Exchange who sells her soul
to the devil (Miss Vance) to become a successful soybean trader.
Stockwell plays her arch-rival in the soybean pit and she falls in
love with Hall, who plays a broker. Ray Charles plays God.
   The director said he envisions ``Limit Up'' as a cross between
the Christmas classic ``It's A Wonderful Life'' and ``Trading
Places,'' the 1983 comedy hit about commodities trading that
featured Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd.
   Martini said he asked a friend at the Board of Trade to recruit
some traders for his movie because he wanted to realistically
portray ``the integrity of bean traders, the camaraderie between
them ... how they are like gladiators in the Roman arena fighting
for the world food supply.''
   Despite such high praise, the Chicago contingent returned home
with their visions of Tinseltown a bit tarnished.
   ``Maybe I thought we'd be involved more,'' White lamented.
   ``Hollywood's very glamorous,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
42-year-old grain trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., ``but the
actual making of fils is very boring.''
