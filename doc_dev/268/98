<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Dan Hruby and </F>
Bohumil Pecinka; place and date not given: "I am No Longer an 
Icebreaker"] 
  [Text] Until quite recently, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus (52) was, for the majority of our citizens, rather like an 
icebreaker that assiduously cuts through the ice floes and hauls 
society forward. However, in recent months, he has seemed more 
like a moderate politician, who customarily prefers constancy to 
variety. This is a change. REFLEX asked: Why has it taken 
place? 
  [Klaus] The most important thing of all is the era, which 
has changed considerably. Previously, we were faced with 
fundamental tasks, whereas now we are dealing with far more 
subtle issues. If at one time it was necessary to chop away at 
them with an icebreaker, now we are using far more delicate 
instruments. This is the objective reality of our era. The 
country has moved from the early transformation phase to the 
posttransformation period. During the period of cutting through 
with an icebreaker, there are also far more people on board with 
you. When dealing with more delicate tasks, you notice that the 
concurrent viewpoints on a whole host of issues have factually 
evaporated. The era of the icebreakers has simply come to an 
end. 
  [REFLEX] Does this mean that the era of systemic changes is 
already behind us? 
  [Klaus] It is impossible to say that the era of systemic 
changes came to an end on this or that day. I would use the 
present continuous tense--it is coming to an end. 
  [REFLEX] Then the revolution is also coming to an end? 
  [Klaus] Is the revolution coming to an end? This seems to 
me, in April 1994, to be a somewhat overdue question. 
  [REFLEX] The Democratic Union was formed recently. It 
considers the November revolution to be incomplete and declares 
itself to be a party for your disappointed voters.... 
  [Klaus] From the little I know about this party, I would say 
that it is an eleventh-hour party of permanent revolutionaries, 
a party of people who have not understood the true size of the 
rear-view mirror through which we look at what is behind us. 
Theirs is bigger than the windshield of the car in which they 
are traveling. On the other hand, these are people who have 
obvious personal interests, and they are concealing them 
partially by means of their strong-arm ideology. 
  [REFLEX] What do you say to their claim that the 
establishment of the Democratic Union was brought about by Civic 
Democratic Party [ODS] policy and that you are, in fact, the 
father of this party? 
  [Klaus] By answering these questions, I am already according 
this party more importance than it merits. The main driving 
force behind this grouping is and will be the publisher of CESKY 
DENIK, Mr. Kudlacek. I have to say that his views on our policy 
were absolutely the same four years ago as they are today. The 
ideological gap between us has not increased by a millimeter 
since his first open letters in ANNONCE. Even then, his demands 
were absurd, unrealistic, and oversimplified. I would recommend 
that everyone read Mr. Kudlacek's articles. 
  [REFLEX] The fact is, it demoralizes the citizens when many 
of the former StB [State Security] and KSC [Communist Party of 
Czechoslovakia] top brass are conducting business unimpeded. 
The radicals are even talking about a nomenklatura 
capitalism... 
  [Klaus] I do not want to say that the quite unique 
privatization of our economy, which, in the space of two or 
three years, has gone from nothing to the current level of 
two-thirds of the overall generation of the GDP in the private 
sector, is a painless and idyllic social activity in which only 
the best and most honest have succeeded. Unfortunately. 
However, I cannot imagine this process being carried out in a 
more rational way. Of course, it was possible to postpone and 
slow down privatization. I am convinced, however, that the 
price we would have to have paid for this delay would have been 
infinitely higher. This is clear to see in many postcommunist 
countries, where, as a consequence of hesitation, there has been 
so-called spontaneous privatization and the results are now far 
worse. There is speculation concerning the social groups in our 
country from which successful businessmen recruit. I have to 
say, however, that nothing can be done about this at the moment. 
These people either have the ability of innovators or not. The 
state can do nothing for them. The "Heroes of Our Time" in the 
economic sphere are not the state's civil servants, planners, or 
ministers. The "Heroes of Our Time" are the entrepreneurs, 
managers, and businessmen who come up with the ideas, whether 
these concern a new enterprise, product, or technology. 
  [REFLEX] Many people voted for you because they felt you 
have a clear vision of society's further development. Are you 
not now concerned, when many people are abandoning the 
icebreaker, and mundane problems, including the endless 
coalition disputes, are cropping up that this vision is being 
lost from sight? 
  [Klaus] I would not confuse the clear vision of society's 
development and the everyday political squabbles within the 
coalition. The vision is something infinitely more profound, 
and the political level only forms a small part of it. 
Therefore, I do not believe that our citizens are losing this 
vision. Nothing I see around me bears this out. The period of 
more subtle conflict among the ideas about the future is just 
beginning. This is natural in a pluralist society. In 1990, 
the main conflict was between visions of East and West. The 
basic slogan of these elections was "Back to Europe." Now this 
slogan is trivial. Everyone, so to speak, can ascribe to it. 
People have matured so much that they are able to ask 
supplementary questions. We are no longer asking if there 
should be a market or planned economy here, but we are dealing 
with how interventionist the market economy should be, how it 
should be regulated, and how socially encumbered it should be. 
That is, I do not view today's disputes as a loss of the 
overall vision but as a progression of the pluralist views 
within it. These are simply disputes on one side of the 
barricade. 
  [REFLEX] Despite this, however, these "disputes on one side 
of the barricade"--for example, among the coalition parties--may 
put people off or provoke disillusionment.... 
  [Klaus] I would not be so dramatic. The coalition is here 
so that it can debate in a coalition manner. This is logical. 
If only one party were in power, there would be "coalition" 
disputes among its ranks by way of a change. When I see the 
problems within the coalition governments in Germany, France, 
and Italy, I do not feel that our coalition is in any way 
exceptional. 
  [REFLEX] Does this mean that the citizens should get used to 
the fact that the current situation is quite normal? 
  [Klaus] The citizens should get used to it, and I think they 
have long been used to it. Instead, I would ask reporters to go 
for the facts and not whether this or that coalition politician 
has said something clever or stupid. 
  [REFLEX] The modern history of the Czech lands is associated 
with left-wing traditions, which culminated so oppressively 
after February 1948. You are now coming up with a program for 
complete privatization and economic liberalism; however, these 
very ideas represent a heterogeneous element in our environment. 
Could it turn out that the only political role you and the 
entire ODS will play in Czech history will actually be the role 
of an icebreaker during the period of transitional changes and 
that later you will lose widespread support because society will 
return to its traditional views? 
  [Klaus] The role of a politician must always be far more 
dynamic, and his vision must be far more definitive than the 
average vision of society and than would correspond to the 
actuality of the country in question. If you want to swing the 
pendulum in an attempt to reach the point at which it turns 
back, you have to strike it with far greater force. At the same 
time, it is clear that the pendulum will again fall back a 
little. This is a fundamental dispute that will never end. 
There will always be a constant clash of ideas here when the 
issue involves the side to which the pendulum will swing. So, 
the fact that my ideology is more right-wing than would 
correspond to the traditions of this country is absolutely in 
order. The task of a politician is to hoist and tighten the 
sails and follow the course plotted. 
  [REFLEX] Do you think that this left-wing tradition "in us" 
could be altered by the post-November developments, especially 
mass privatization? 
  [Klaus] Here we must, first and foremost, answer the 
question on the role of tradition in forming political, social, 
and cultural--simply, all--views of the world. Apart from this 
historical vertical axis of traditions, there is also a 
horizontal factor--that is, to what extent events in the 
surrounding world influence us. Let us go a bit further: Is it 
possible to extricate ourselves from this vertical axis of 
traditions and the horizontal axis of external influences and, 
by means of our own shrewd policy, push general views forward? 
This is the third factor that determines society's orientation. 
I personally believe that the past will not pull us back too 
much. The social democratic or pseudosocialist tradition in our 
country was considerably overturned by the advent of communism, 
and it thus suffered far more breaches than in the countries of 
Western Europe. There, this tradition was far from being 
suppressed, devastated, and more or less negated by the 
experiences of the past 50 years. Therefore, I am not concerned 
that our citizens would be too enticed by the socialist ideas of 
the first half of the 20th century. 
  [REFLEX] What, then, are you concerned about? 
  [Klaus] I am a little concerned about the horizontal axis. 
The Western ideological world is positioned a little differently 
than I would like. The gravitational pull to the left will come 
from Western Europe--that is, from our natural environment 
rather than from our own past. 
  [REFLEX] However, you also mentioned a third factor.... 
  [Klaus] This represents everything that we ourselves are 
capable of pushing through, asserting, and emphasizing. I 
believe that we are not helpless against the influences from our 
past and the surrounding world. I am not a pessimist about 
this. We have strength, independence, and reasoning, and so we 
also have hopes of preserving a certain Czech specificity into 
the future. 
  [REFLEX] Specificity in what? 
  [Klaus] Our Republic gravitates more toward the West than 
the other postcommunist countries, but, on the other hand, it is 
more aware of the danger of collectivist theories than Western 
countries. It is in this very area--and I am saying this without 
any arrogance--that I see a certain role for us within the 
Pan-European context. 
  [REFLEX] Do you think it is possible in present-day Western 
Europe to discern any trend that society there would orient 
itself more to the right or to the left? 
  [Klaus] The period of time between an idea being formulated, 
implemented, and, finally, becoming firmly rooted throughout 
society is very long. Despite the fact that the 1960's and the 
1970's saw a marked ideological swing to the right, left-wing 
state interventionism reached its peak during this period. 
Then, at the beginning of the 1980's, politicians like Ronald 
Reagan and Margaret Thatcher grasped the new ideas and began to 
put them into political practice in their countries. However, I 
will not speculate about whether the third phase has already 
been achieved--that is, when these ideas have definitively 
penetrated the citizens' consciousness. Nevertheless, today we 
can all see that, in the ideological sphere, which precedes 
reality, the pendulum in Western Europe is beginning to swing 
back to the left. So, there will still be something to contend 
with in the ideological sphere. 
  [REFLEX] You said that the experience with communism in our 
country has discredited socialist ideas. However, in Poland and 
Lithuania, for example, they have had the same experience, but 
still the postcommunists won the free elections there.... 
  [Klaus] In these countries, compared with the Czech 
Republic, the development of the political system is less 
evolved. The political forces there are still political 
movements that are not ideologically precisely defined. They 
are fronts for something or forums against someone. This means 
that the structure of political life there is proceeding 
otherwise than along a right-left line. In policy, the forces 
there are more rational and less rational, more pragmatic or 
less pragmatic, more or less organized, and these differences 
are more important than right-left polarity. This means that 
the forces that won the elections in these countries may be more 
rational at a given moment and the governments more capable. 
  [REFLEX] Does this also apply to Slovakia? 
  [Klaus] Yes. 
  [REFLEX] We had originally intended this interview to be a 
summary of a specific period. However, it now seems to us that 
this is not the right time to take a look at what has happened. 
For example, the issues of restitution and the senate have not 
been dealt with. When do you think the time will be right to 
take a look at these issues? 
  [Klaus] Any time is right for taking a look around. I do 
not understand, however, why you two should consider the issues 
of the senate and restitution to be the dominant issues facing 
our society. These are absolutely marginal issues that do not 
concern the essence of this country. It is only certain 
politicians that incessantly and artificially drag them to the 
forefront. However, I do not believe that we should write the 
history of this state during the past four years according to 
them. I do not believe that these are the issues that people 
talk about every day over a pint in the pub or around the dinner 
table at home.
