SAN PEDRO GETS PROMISE BUT NO ACTION ON BID FOR BED TAXES 
</P>

San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce officials, along with their friends in 
the hotel business, were girded for battle last month, set to make an unusual 
pitch to get back a share of hotel bed taxes collected by the city of Los 
Angeles in the seaside community. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, drafted by the chamber and supported by City Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, would send 9% of hotel transient occupancy taxes back to San 
Pedro, for use by the chamber in advertising the community as a tourist 
destination. But after lining up troops to argue for the long-shot plan at a 
Feb. 14 meeting of the Community and Economic Development Committee, the bed 
tax proposal was inadvertently omitted from the agenda, said chamber and 
council representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, they haven't rescheduled it. We knew this was going to be a hot 
potato, but we thought we would at least get a hearing on it," Leron Gubler, 
executive director of the chamber, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Robert Farrell, who chairs the Community and Economic 
Development Committee, said last week that he prefers to hold a committee 
meeting in San Pedro to discuss the proposal, along with other Harbor area 
economic issues, with residents. 
</P>
<P>
"This idea is worthy for us to discuss. I intend to set the hearing for some 
time in mid-April. There is nothing intrinsic in the issue causing the delay. . 
. , " Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles annually collects about $70 million through a 12% hotel transient 
occupancy tax -- the bed tax. Almost 60% of that money is used to improve 
public safety, public works and recreation citywide. No money is earmarked for 
local entities. 
</P>
<P>
About $6 million is given to the Greater Los Angeles Visitors and Convention 
Bureau, which spends it to promote tourism. However, the bureau does not divide 
up taxes to highlight specific areas, such as San Pedro, and uses the money 
instead to showcase the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber officials say San Pedro, which dangles like a pendulum 23 miles from 
downtown Los Angeles, gets short shrift when it comes to promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"We get very little spinoff from the visitors's bureau, which is centered 
downtown," Gubler said. "How are we going to create an identity for ourselves 
when we are merely a footnote in a publication about all of Southern 
California? It seems logical that people directly affected are best able to 
promote the area." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, chamber officials say, $386,000 was collected by the city in hotel bed 
taxes in San Pedro. But with new hotels opening soon, chamber officials 
anticipate San Pedro could contribute nearly $1 million in bed taxes to city 
coffers. What the chamber wants is to spend 9% of that just promoting the San 
Pedro area. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials criticize the plan, fearing it could open a Pandora's box 
if other Los Angeles communities seek a greater share of locally collected 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo sent to Farrell before the scheduled February hearing of the bed tax 
proposal, City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie wrote: "We cannot support 
diverting a portion of any tax . . . to the communities which generate the 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro was annexed by Los Angeles in 1909 to give the city control over the 
lucrative Port of Los Angeles. But in recent years, shipbuilding and canning, 
once the mainstays of the port community, have had drastic declines. San Pedro 
has turned to tourism to keep dollars flowing into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next year, San Pedro expects to open three new hotels, increasing by 
150% the number of available rooms in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major priority last year was to get tourist facilities and hotels. We have 
achieved that, but now we have to fill those rooms," Gubler said. 
</P>
<P>
If the unusual plan is approved, San Pedro hotel officials say the chamber's 
Tourism Council would use the money -- potentially $90,000 a year -- in a 
number of ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We could produce a directory with advertising, have a video made about 
attractions in San Pedro, attend trade shows. . . . Right now, travelers 
staying in the area before embarking on cruises stay at the airport," said Jane 
Walton, director of sales and marketing for the Sheraton San Pedro hotel, which 
is to open in May. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro tourism promoters have always said that the area is ideally located 
for visitors to Los Angeles: far enough from crowded, smoggy downtown, but 
still close to such attractions as Disneyland and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone concedes it is an uphill political fight to get the money, 
particularly with other areas of Los Angeles watching the San Pedro campaign in 
hopes of imitating it if it is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who is backing the plan, said: "I'm not so sure it is a bad idea to 
help the community in trying to do some self-promotion."
