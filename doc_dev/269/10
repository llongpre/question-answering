MAYTAG, the fourth biggest US domestic appliance maker, yesterday predicted
a 33 per cent drop in underlying third-quarter earnings and said it would
take a pre-tax Dollars 95m restructuring charge to cover reorganisation in
Europe and the US.
Mr Leonard Hadley, chief executive, blamed the erosion in earnings on
'continued losses in Europe, extra start up costs associated with the new
dishwasher facility and the new Magic Chef ranges'.
He said the group was also hurt by 'the stalled US economic recovery and
fierce competition in the appliance and floor care industries both here and
abroad'.
Although analysts had expected a slowdown from Maytag's strong first-quarter
growth, yesterday's announcement surprised Wall Street. The shares were
halted in the morning and when trading resumed in the early afternoon they
fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 7/8 .
In the 1991 third quarter, Maytag earned 23 cents a share and most analysts
had expected earnings of about 27 cents in the same period of this year.
The company's balance sheet has been weakened by a string of large
acquisitions in the 1980s, including Magic Chef in a Dollars 736m stock swap
and Hoover for Dollars 961m in cash and stock, which significantly increased
its debt burden. In addition, Maytag has been hit by the impact of the
recession on the appliance industry.
In a move to conserve cash, the company cut its dividend in February, 1991
for the first time since 1946. Mr Hadley said the reorganisation was 'an
investment in our future, and we expect to recover the charge in
approximately three years through improved earnings'. The company said its
Hoover operations have been losing money, largely because of excess capacity
and the deterioration of economic conditions in the UK and other European
countries.
'In the past two years, we have implemented significant cost reduction
activities throughout our Hoover Europe operations,' Mr Hadley said, 'but
further reorganisation is necessary. Over-capacity is prevalent in
manufacturing throughout Europe, and Hoover is no exception.'
He added that the reorganisation would be aimed at reducing production
capacity and streamlining sales, marketing, administrative and distribution
operations in Europe.
In the US, Maytag plans to consolidate the sales, marketing and most
financial and information systems functions of its Magic Chef division into
its Jenn-Air division. Its Hoover operations in North America will also be
involved in the reorganisation.
