   Binney &amp; Smith Inc., known for its Crayola
brand crayons, has entered into a licensing and royalty agreement
with Magic Marker Industries Inc. to make and sell products under
the Magic Marker name and trademark, according to the two companies.
   The financial terms of the agreement and its duration were not
disclosed.
   Magic Marker, based in Trenton, N.J., has been operating under
protection of Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws since April 1986.
   Binney &amp; Smith, which makes drawing products as well as crayons,
will begin selling products under the Magic Marker name on April 1,
the company said. The product line includes permanent markers,
pocket pens and highlighters for adults and water-based markers and
coloring pens for children.
   Brad Drexler, a Binney &amp; Smith spokesman, said the Magic Marker
products will be made by an outside manufacturer. The identity of
the manufacturer was not disclosed.
   The licensing agreement is part of Binney &amp; Smith's strategy to
expand its coloring and drawing product line, said Richard S. Gurin,
president and chief executive officer.
   `'Our preliminary market research has shown a positive awareness
among consumers for the Magic Marker name,'' Gurin said, ``and this
licensing venture will afford us an opportunity to evaluate the
future potential of the equity in the Magic Marker name.''
   Cindy Constantini, a spokeswoman for Magic Marker, said the
licensing and royalty agreement will allow the company to complete
its reorganization plan.
