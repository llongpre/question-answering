   Maytag Corp.'s proposed $1 billion
buyout of Chicago Pacific Corp., the maker of Hoover appliances, is
a positive but expensive move for Maytag, according to some
industry watchers.
   While the price the Newton-based company plans to pay for
Chicago Pacific is seen by some as a bit high, the takeover will
give it entry into European markets while helping insulate it from
any unwanted takeover.
   ``The fit is excellent, although the price is a bit high,'' said
Mark Hassenberg, of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities, Inc.,
in New York.
   Maytag said Monday it would launch a cash tender offer of $60 a
share for up to 6.4 million shares, or about 49 percent of the
outstanding shares, of Chicago Pacific. The remaining Chicago
Pacific shares will be converted into an equivalent amount of
Maytag stock.
   The companies said the tender offer and the merger together are
valued at about $1 billion. The combined sales of both companies
would exceed $3 billion.
   Hassenberg predicted that the buyout would erode Maytag's
earnings by as much as 25 cents a share next year but said the
company would regain that ground in 1990.
   He said Hoover has an ``outstanding position'' in Europe and
Maytag should be able to use that reputation to introduce its own
line of major appliances.
   ``Through Chicago Pacific's Hoover division, we will become a
leader in the international major appliance market,'' said Maytag
chairman Daniel J. Krumm in a prepared statement.
   He said the acquisition was a milestone for Maytag because it
``provides increased opportunities for our shareowners and helps us
achieve our long-term strategy of becoming a global leader in the
major appliance field.''
   Maytag shares finished down $2.75 at $23.75 a share Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Chicago Pacific shares zoomed up
$13.25 to $56.62{ a share.
   The board of directors of Chicago Pacific, including Chicago
businessman Lester Crown whose family is the company's largest
shareholder with 15 percent, has approved the transaction, a news
release from the companies said. Crown intends to exchange his
family's stock and convertible bond holdings to Maytag stock, the
release said.
   While investors drove Maytag's value down at the news of the
deal, several analysts praised the combination as a long-term plus
for the company. Other analysts said the deal signals that Maytag
intends to fight off any takeover bids.
   ``For investors looking for a Maytag takeover, it wasn't very
positive news,'' said Tim Dunn, an analyst for the Provident
National Bank of Philadelphia. ``But that's OK with me. Hoover is a
quality asset, with the most interesting thing coming from their
position internationally.
   ``This won't put them (Maytag) in the league with Whirlpool or
General Electric, but it was the most they could do. It's a very
positive move,'' said Dunn.
   Another analyst, James Ballessa of the D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., of
Great Falls, Mont., said Maytag was hoping to make itself less
attractive as a takeover prospect.
   ``I know the company has anti-takeover provisions in its bylaws,
but they may have wanted to add a wart to make themselves less
attractive to a suitor. It's possible this is a wart. I don't
understand the logic,'' he said.
   Maytag's prime appliance brands are Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air,
Magic Chef, Norge and Maytag. It also makes vending machines.
   In addition to Hoover, Chicago Pacific has several lines of
furniture, including Kittinger, Pennsylvania House, McGuire, Brown
Jordan and Gunlocke.
   Hoover has 13 production facilities in eight countries to
manufacture and distribute washers, dryers, refrigerators,
dishwashers and microwave ovens in addition to the floor care line.
It does not market the major appliances in the United Statesm, and
gets about 65 percent of its revenue overseas.
   Chicago Pacific is the successor of the Rock Island Railroad,
which emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 1984.
