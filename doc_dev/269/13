   Veteran Maytag Corp. executive Leonard
Hadley on Thursday was named to the newly created position of chief
operating officer of the international appliance maker, a promotion
that makes him a likely eventual successor for Maytag's chairman,
Daniel Krumm.
   ``By creating this position, we are strengthening our management
structure for the future,'' Krumm said. ``Len's appointment to his
new post is a reflection of not only his considerable achievements,
but of the confidence we have in him as Maytag moves into the
decade of the '90s.''
   Albert Taylor, a securities analyst who follows Maytag for the
Chicago firm Duff &amp; Phelps, said the appointment was no surprise.
   ``Hadley has been a longtime Maytag man and has a good
reputation at the company,'' Taylor said. ``It also sets the stage
for Hadley to be the likely successor for Dan Krumm.''
   Krumm will turn 64 later this year. Hadley is 55.
   Maytag, based in the central Iowa community of Newton, expanded
last year with the acquisition of the Hoover line of floor care
products, and reported earnings of $131.5 million on sales of $3.09
billion in 1989.
   But the international expansion has created problems for the
company, which had a 24.3 percent slide in its fourth-quarter 1989
profit as a result of sluggish British sales and high interest
payments on its takeover debt.
   Hadley was executive vice president for Maytag and president of
its appliance group, which includes Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air,
Magic Chef, Maytag and Norge brands.
   Hadley will continue to oversee North American appliance
operations, including the Maycor appliance parts and service
subsidiary. He also will assume responsibility for the Dixie-Narco
group, which specializes in soft drink vending equipment and
supplies leading syrup companies at home and abroad.
   Frank Vaughn, an executive vice president who reports to Krumm,
continues to head Maytag's Hoover group.
   Hadley has been an executive vice president since February 1989
and was named head of the appliance group last June.
   The native of Earlham holds an accounting degree from the
University of Iowa and joined Maytag as a cost accountant in 1959.
He has been a member of the board of directors since 1985.
