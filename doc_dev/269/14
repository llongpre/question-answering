   Maytag Corp. "is not unhappy with" Wall Street estimates that it will earn $3.45 to $3.60 a share from continuing operations in 1987, Daniel J. Krumm, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   That estimate indicates 1987 profit from continuing operations of about $145 million, based on the 40.6 million common shares outstanding that the appliance maker expects to have at the end of the year. 
Maytag is buying back about five million of its common shares. 

   For 1986, a pre-tax charge of $17.8 million for the acquisition of Magic Chef Inc. made profit from continuing operations $118.9 million, or $2.75 a share. 
A $2 million loss from Toastmaster discontinued operations and a $5.7 million extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt made 1986 net income $111.2 million, or $2.57 a share. 

   Maytag doesn't expect any extraordinary charges in 1987. 

   Maytag expects 1987 sales to grow "in the high single digits" from 1986 sales of $1.72 billion, said Jerry A. Schiller, senior vice president and chief financial officer. 
"The consumer confidence level is still pretty strong," he said. 

   However, the company expects only flat to slightly rising 1988 sales for it and the U.S. appliance industry. 
Mr. Krumm said in an interview that slowly rising interest rates and a downturn in the housing industry will hurt the industry after four years of record sales. 

   Mr. Krumm said the Magic Chef acquisition moved Maytag into the major appliance lines in which it wants to be, such as refrigerators and ranges. 
In 1989, the company plans to launch a Maytag label of refrigerators, he said.
