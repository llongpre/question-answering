   Maytag Corp. said Tuesday it will sell the
five furniture companies it obtained last week in its acquisition of
Chicago Pacific Corp.
   ``The furniture companies are all quality firms with
well-established brand names, but they don't fit in with our
long-range plans,'' Maytag president Daniel Krumm said.
   ``Selling them will strengthen our balance sheet,'' he said.
   For sale are Brown Jordan of El Monte, Calif.; Gunlocke of
Wayland, N.Y.; Kittinger of Buffalo, N.Y.; McGuire of San Francisco;
and Pennsylvania House of Lewisburg, Pa.
   Krumm said the companies had combined estimated sales last year
of $254 million. He said the companies will be sold as a group.
   Also for sale is Charter Group of Martinsville, Va., which
handles contract sales to the hospitality industry.
   Maytag purchased Chicago Pacific for $1 billion, primarily to
obtain its Hoover division, best known for Hoover vacuum cleaners.
Hoover's foothold in European markets also gives Maytag a chance to
expand European sales of its major appliances, which include the
brand names Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag and
Norge.
