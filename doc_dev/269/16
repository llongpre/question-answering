   Maytag Co. said it sold Toastmaster Inc. to a group of the unit's executives in a leveraged buyout. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Maytag, which makes kitchen appliances and laundry products, said it sold Toastmaster, which makes small appliances, to focus on its core lines. 
Toastmaster is based in Columbia, Mo. 
Maytag said the sale didn't include Heatube Co., a Toastmaster division in Clarence, Mo. 

   Maytag acquired Toastmaster as a unit of Magic Chef Inc. last March in a stock transaction valued at $750 million. 
Magic Chef in 1983 acquired Toastmaster, then a closely held concern, for $43.2 million.
