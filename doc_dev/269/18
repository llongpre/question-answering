   Maytag Corp. says it will sell its furniture
business to Ladd Furniture Corp. in a $213 million transaction.
   Maytag had been trying to find a buyer for the six furniture
companies since it acquired those businesses with the Hoover Co. in
its January takeover of their parent, the Chicago Pacific Corp.
   Maytag has said it wants to concentrate on its core businesses
of home appliances and vending equipment.
   Under the agreement announced Thursday, Ladd, of High Point,
N.C., will pay Maytag $202.5 million in cash and will assume
approximately $10.5 million in debt on the books of the furniture
companies in California, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
   The deal is subject to regulatory review and completion of
financing of the transaction by Ladd, which said it already has a
commitment from Chase Manhattan Bank. The transaction is scheduled
to close in approximately 30 days, Maytag said.
   The companies being sold are Brown Jordan, located at El Monte,
Calif.; Gunlocke, Wayland, N.Y.; Kittinger, Buffalo, N.Y.; McGuire,
San Francisco; Pennsylvania House, Lewisburg, Pa.; and Charter
Group, Martinsville, Va.
   Maytag is made up of 13 companies with manufacturing facilities
in eight countries and approximately 28,000 employees. Its
appliance brands are Admiral, Jenn-Air, Hardwick, Hoover, Magic
Chef, Maytag and Norge.
