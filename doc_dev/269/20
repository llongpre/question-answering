   Maytag Corp. on Friday said it has begun
a tender offer in its previously announced $960 million cash and
stock bid for Chicago Pacific Corp.
   Maytag, itself the subject of takeover rumors, is offering to buy
up to 6.4 million shares, or about 49 percent of the outstanding
Chicago Pacific common stock, at $60 a share.
   The two companies announced an agreement to merge earlier this
week.
   If Maytag's tender offer is successful, and stockholders approve,
Chicago Pacific would become part of Maytag and each remaining share
of Chicago Pacific stock would be converted into Maytag shares. The
rate of exchange would be not more than one share of Chicago Pacific
for 2.7272 shares of Maytag and not less than 2.1429 Maytag shares.
   Among conditions on the offer is that at least 4 million Chicago
Pacific shares are tendered to Maytag and not withdrawn by the
midnight EST Nov. 28 expiration of the offer.
   Maytag, based in Newton, is a maker of home appliances and
vending equipment, and its principal appliance brands are Admiral,
Hardwick, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag and Norge.
   Chicago Pacific is best known for its Hoover vacuum cleaners and
floor care products.
   Last year, Maytag had sales of $1.8 billion, while Chicago
Pacific sales came to $1.1 billion.
