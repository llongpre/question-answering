   Maytag Corp. on Wednesday named a new
managing director to its Hoover appliance business in Britain as
part of what it called a major reorganization of the European
business.
   Hoover's appliance and floor care operation in the United
Kingdom has been a drain on Maytag profitability since Maytag
acquired the business in a 1989 takeover of the Chicago Pacific
Corp.
   Daniel Krumm, Maytag's chairman, announced the latest in a
series of steps to shore up the British operations in remarks to
employees at Hoover production facilities in England, Scotland and
Wales. He said the plan is designed to achieve the ``rebirth,
rejuvenation, stability and return to profitability'' of Hoover UK.
   Krumm named veteran labor relations executive William Foust to
succeed Anthony Williamson as managing director of Hoover UK and to
head a task force to speed organizational changes and implement
production efficiencies.
   Foust is the senior vice president of human resources at Maytag
and a former officer of the Magic Chef Co., another Maytag
subsidiary. Krumm said Foust will serve full time in South Wales
until he completes the special assignment, then return to Maytag's
headquarters in the central Iowa community of Newton.
   Williamson, who has worked for Hoover for more than 30 years,
announced he intends to retire but will continue to serve as a
director and to represent Hoover with various industry
associations.
   The shakeup was no surprise, said analyst Russell Leavitt, who
follows Maytag for the New York investment firm Salomon Brothers.
   ``That business has suffered in the last year or two,
essentially since they got it,'' Leavitt said. He said Maytag
executives were dissatisfied with the performance of Hoover UK but
probably needed time to understand industry conditions in Britain,
which has been hit by a major slump in its appliance business.
   Maytag, which does not disclose results from Hoover UK, last
week reported a $15.7 million operating loss from European
operations for the first nine months of the year, compared with an
operating loss of $8.3 million a year earlier. The Hoover UK
operations were a big contributor to the operating loss, said
Maytag spokeswoman Lisa Mendheim.
   The operating loss came despite a 24 percent increase in sales,
to $340.1 million from $273.7 million.
   Maytag had net earnings of $86 million on sales of $2.33 billion
for the first nine months of 1990, compared with profit of $91.7
million on sales of $2.29 billion in the same period a year
earlier.
   The reorganization followed capital improvements and
cost-cutting programs in Britain.
   Maytag said earlier this year it will invest about $22 million
in a major renovation in Wales.
   Hoover reduced its work force by 17 percent in the United
Kingdom in 1989 and cut 700 additional jobs this year. It still has
4,500 workers in Britain out of a global work force of
approximately 25,000.
