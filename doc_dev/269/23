   Maytag Corp., as part of a continuing reorganization, said it is holding talks to sell two of the Newton, Iowa, appliance maker's smaller business units. 

   On the auction block are Jenn Industries Inc., based in Indianapolis, and Magic Chef Air Conditioning Co., Bellevue, Ohio. 
Maytag said it is "holding discussions with certain interested parties" about their buying the units, which had combined sales of $86.7 million in 1987. 

   Daniel J. Krumm, Maytag chairman and chief executive officer, said that selling the units will allow Maytag to concentrate on its core businesses of major appliances and vending equipment.
