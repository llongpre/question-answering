   Maytag Corp. said its fourth-quarter earnings tumbled 68%
from a year earlier, increasing speculation that its board
will cut the dividend at its meeting Thursday.
   The appliance maker said earnings fell to $12.9 million,
or 12 cents a share, from $39.8 million, or 38 cents a share.
Sales fell 9% to $724.8 million from $800.2 million.

   The latest quarterly per-share profit is far less than the
Newton, Iowa, company's current quarterly payout of 22.5
cents a share, and neither the company nor analysts see any
quick rebound from the appliance industry's slump.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Maytag closed at $11.75, down 12.5 cents.
   "I think it's a 50-50 shot they will cut the dividend,"
said Albert Turner, of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., echoing the
statements of other analysts who follow the company.
   Maytag's board considered trimming the payout at its
November meeting before deciding to go ahead with the regular
fourth-quarter dividend plus a traditional year-end extra
dividend of five cents a share. The dividend hasn't been cut
since it was reinstituted in 1946.
   A Maytag spokesman wouldn't comment on the dividend
speculation, except to say directors will "evaluate the
appropriate level" of the dividend at their meeting Thursday.
   The directors' meeting comes as the appliance industry
battles an abrupt slowdown. In its earnings report, Maytag
said that it was hurt by the "precipitous drop" in consumer
confidence after Iraq invaded Kuwait and by a "further
deterioration" in U.S. economic conditions.
   But Maytag has other problems, including a hefty debt load
brought on by the 1986 acquisition of Magic Chef Inc. and the
1989 takeover of Chicago Pacific Corp. and its Hoover unit.
Maytag, which started the 1980s with no long-term debt, now
shows total debt at nearly 48% of capital. It's also trying
to turn around Hoover's European appliance business, which
had an operating loss of nearly $23 million last year.
   Jonathan Goldfarb, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, estimates
Maytag's operating cash flow was a negative $50 million in
1990, and figures about the same for 1991. He defines
operating cash flow as net income plus depreciation, minus
capital spending and dividends.
   While paring the payout would save money, a large portion
of Maytag's 32,745 shareholders are individuals who rely on
the generous yield. "It's a tough one," for Maytag directors,
Mr. Goldfarb said.
   In an interview in December, Maytag Chairman Daniel J.
Krumm described the board's move to maintain the dividend
level last fall as a "very difficult decision." He added it
would be a "major point of discussion" at Thursday's meeting.
The Maytag spokesman said Mr. Krumm wasn't available to
comment yesterday.
   For the year, Maytag's earnings fell nearly 25% to $98.9
million, or 94 cents a share, from $131.5 million, or $1.27 a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell 1% to $3.06 billion from
$3.09 billion.
