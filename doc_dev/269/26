   Maytag Corp. said it plans to spend an additional $30 million to upgrade and expand its Galesburg, Ill., plant, which makes the Admiral line of appliances. 

   The increased allocation brings to $50 million the amount the Newton, Iowa-based appliance maker plans to spend on the Admiral plant. 
Maytag acquired the plant in 1986 at the time of its acquisition of Magic Chef Co., Admiral's former parent. 

   Maytag said the first phase of the Galesburg project, begun last year, is scheduled for completion next year and will enable it to produce its first line of refrigerators and freezers bearing the Maytag name. 
The second phase, which will extend through 1990, will allow Maytag to build appliances that meet energy efficiency standards that go into effect in the 1990s as a result of federal legislation, a Maytag spokeswoman said.
