FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Taskforce may be Hoover's last
stand - A look at Maytag's emergency review of the UK group

ONLY three months ago, the British government was trumpeting the decision by
Hoover to close a factory in Dijon, France, and switch production to
Scotland as proof of the UK's international competitiveness and its
attractions as a manufacturing base.
Today, that crowing looks decidedly premature. Not only are there doubts
about whether the production shift from France will take place, but
according to Hoover's top management, the survival of the entire business is
at stake - largely because of the poor performance of its UK operations.
Mr Gerald Kamman, president of Hoover Europe and UK managing director, said
yesterday that a special taskforce dispatched by Maytag, Hoover's US parent,
was conducting an emergency review of the business in an effort to cut costs
and restore profitability.
Though the review will take three weeks to complete, Mr Kamman said
redundancies were unavoidable and plant closures possible. He said he did
not feel bound by Hoover's earlier commitment to move production to
Scotland, for which the UK government has pledged Pounds 2.5m (Dollars
3.85m) in assistance.
When Mr Kamman arrived in Britain a month ago, it was widely assumed that
his appointment was prompted by Hoover's free flights promotional fiasco.
That incident led to the dismissal of Mr William Foust, Mr Kamman's
predecessor, the departure of two other senior executives and a Dollars 30m
charge against Maytag's first-quarter earnings.
It is now clear that an even more pressing reason was the steep
deterioration in the performance of Hoover Europe, which last year lost
Dollars 67.1m after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge on sales of Dollars
501.9m. Mr Kamman said there had been little improvement in operating
results this year, and that a continuing loss in the UK had been forecast in
the budget drawn up by Hoover's previous management.
Tackling Hoover's problems has become increasingly urgent for Maytag, the
fourth-largest US domestic appliance manufacturer, which plunged into a
Dollars 315m loss last year on sales of Dollars 3bn. Largely because of the
special Hoover provision, Maytag lost a further Dollars 10.5m in the first
quarter of this year.
For most of its 86-year history, the Iowa-based company has been renowned
for cautious management and home-spun values. But in the mid-1980s it was
bitten by the takeover bug and spent Dollars 1.8bn to acquire Magic Chef, a
US kitchen appliance company, and Chicago Pacific, which had owned Hoover
since 1985.
However, the moves - which took Maytag out of the US for the first time -
proved over ambitious. Beset by management problems in its acquisitions,
saddled with heavy debt and smitten by recession, the company has spent much
of the 1990s struggling to keep its head above water.
Turning Hoover around is crucial to Maytag's future. But on past form, it
will not be easy. Hoover's UK operations, which date back to 1932, have a
chequered history.
The company got into difficulties in the 1970s, but returned to profit in
the early 1980s after cutting costs, shedding staff, modernising production
and launching products. But by 1989, soon after it was bought by Maytag, it
was in trouble again and had to dismiss almost 1,000 staff.
The following year, Maytag dispatched Mr Foust and a special taskforce to
Britain with a remit to bring about its 'rebirth, rejuvenation, stability
and return to profitability'.
Two years later, investments of Pounds 20m were announced in Hoover's two UK
plants, at Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, and Cambuslang, Scotland, in an
effort to make it a pan-European producer. Last January, the company decided
to transfer vacuum cleaner production from Dijon to Cambuslang.
However, Mr Kamman believes further painful surgery is needed. Though some
parts of Hoover Europe are operating satisfactorily, others are afflicted by
serious and widespread problems.
Mr Kamman said two of Hoover's three European plants, in Dijon and
Cambuslang, were close to profitability. However, there had been a
substantial fall in French sales since the political controversy over the
production transfer erupted.
In the UK, sales had held up quite well, after receiving a lift from the
free flights promotion. However, the company was losing money on some
product lines while overheads in several areas were too high.
Mr Kamman said that some 'pieces of the company' might have to be closed
down completely. He said that job cuts were likely to fall more heavily on
indirect employees than on those on the factory floor.
It will probably take until the end of the year to draw up a complete
recovery plan - and longer before it is clear whether it is working. But
judging by Hoover's troubled past, and Mr Kamman's grim analysis of its
present problems, this could be the company's last chance.
