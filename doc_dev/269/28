   Whirlpool Corp.'s plan to acquire a majority
stake in the appliance division of Dutch electronics giant NV
Philips guarantees the company the top slot among appliance makers
around the globe.
   Whirlpool announced Thursday it will pay Philips $470 million
for 53 percent of a joint venture company that will develop,
manufacture and market major appliances under Philips' brand names.
   The new company will employ 14,000 people from the present
Philips division and will have annual sales of about $2 billion,
boosting Whirpool's annual revenue to about $6 billion, the
companies said in a statement.
   Whirlpool, a close second domestically to General Electric Co.,
long has sought to branch out of the relatively mature, $12 billion
U.S. appliance market. The company is affiliated with appliance
concerns in Canada, Brazil, Mexico and India but not in the
lucrative European market represented by Philips.
   ``They desperately needed a well-established brand, which
Philips is,'' said Charles Ryan, a first vice president at the
investment firm Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Philips is the world's largest television maker and Europe's
biggest electronics company.
   Whirlpool's move mirrors deals by other manufacturing companies
seeking to rid themselves of weaker businesses and focus on markets
where they can be major players.
   Last year, GE became one of the world's top medical equipment
concerns after swapping its consumer electronics business for
Thomson SA's medical equipment operations. Thomson, in turn,
strengthened its role in consumer electronics.
   Also last year, Philips acquired the 42 percent of North
American Philips Corp. it did not already own to solidify its
strength in the television, lighting, radio and appliance markets
here.
   ``You can't be everything to everybody,'' said Gerrit Jeelof,
executive vice president and vice chairman of the board of
management of Philips.
   Speaking at a press conference here, Jeelof said the Whirlpool
venture would free management resources to concentrate on Philips'
core electronics businesses, such as semiconductors and the coming
generation of high-definition television.
   Last year, Philips discussed a joint venture with Whirlpool and
Britain's General Electric Co., which is unrelated to the U.S.
company of the same name. Those talks fell through because of
uncertain economic conditions following the stock market crash and
a weak dollar.
   ``But they parted very friendly, and this year the dollar has
come back up relative to the (Dutch) guilder, so talks were
reactivated,'' Merrill Lynch's Ryan said.
   Whirlpool will pay Philips $350 million for a 53 percent stake
in the joint venture and $120 million more if the venture continues
beyond three years. Whirlpool has an option to acquire the
remainder of the Philips division, for which it would pay $470
million instead of the $120 million.
   The new company will be based in the Netherlands and will market
washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, stoves, microwave ovens
and dishwashers around the world, but primarily in Europe.
Appliances will be sold under the Philips, Bauknecht and Ignis
brand names.
   Whirlpool could take advantage of Philips' expertise in
convection cooking and gas cooking, while the European joint
venture could benefit from Whirlpool's strength in products such as
dishwashers, air conditioners and clothes dryers that are beginning
to catch on in Europe, said David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
   Whirlpool stock rose 12{ cents to $25.75 a share in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., manufactures and
markets a range of home appliances under the Whirlpool, Kitchenaid
and Roper brand names. The company, which employs about 31,000
people and has annual sales of about $4.2 billion, also is a major
supplier to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. of Kenmore products.
   The joint venture is the latest in a string of consolidations in
the appliance industry.
   Earlier this year Whirlpool engaged in a bidding war with GE
over the appliance maker Roper Corp. GE ultimately acquired Roper
and its manufacturing facilities, but Whirlpool struck a deal to
gain the Roper brand name.
   Other major appliance mergers in recent years include Maytag
Corp.'s acquisition of Magic Chef Co. and the acquisition of White
Consolidated Industries by Sweden's Electrolux AB.
   Last month Philips announced its profit fell 44 percent in the
second quarter, an unexpectedly poor performance that the company
blamed on an onslaught of competition from Southeast Asia and
losses on foreign currencies.
   Philips hinted then that it was about to take a major step to
raise cash, such as a big joint venture or sale of a large part of
the company.
   Philips, whose annual sales have topped $25 billion, has been
cutting costs at its European factories and moving more production
to lower-cost areas, including the United States. In the past seven
months it has laid off 6,000 European employees and has promised at
least 4,000 more cuts.
