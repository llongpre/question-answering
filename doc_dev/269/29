   LORAL Corp. (New York) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it upgraded Loral's senior debt rating to Baa-1 from
Baa-2 and its subordinated debt rating to Baa-3 from Ba-1.
About $412 million of debt is affected, the rating agency
said. The upgrades reflect Loral's successful assimilation of
Ford Motor Co.'s aerospace business, Loral's strengthened
financial condition and its expected healthy operating
performance over the next few years, Moody's said. "Loral's
leading position in the defense electronics sector
differentiates its business prospects from those of the
overall defense industry." The defense electronics sector is
expected to show modest growth even in an environment of
downward pressures on defense spending, the rating concern
said.

   MAYTAG Corp. (Newton, Iowa) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
said it placed this household appliance maker's
single-A-minus senior unsecured debt rating on CreditWatch
with negative implications, affecting $636 million of debt.
The rating concern cited "fundamental weaknesses" in several
of Maytag's businesses as well as S&amp;P's expectations for a
"relatively weak recovery" in 1992. Even after the business
cycle improves, S&amp;P said, Maytag is "likely to face
difficulty" in restoring profitability. Financial performance
has been under pressure while debt leverage has increased
"substantially," S&amp;P said. The rating concern said Maytag's
Magic Chef brands will continue to face "significant"
competition, while its Hoover Europe unit is suffering in a
"slumping" U.K. market. High levels of capital spending
probably will continue to limit the company's capacity to
reduce debt, S&amp;P said. Maytag's A-2 commercial paper rating
wasn't placed on CreditWatch.
