<P>
Up to 50,000 people who bought microwave ovens thinking they were new when they 
weren't can get refunds from Maytag Corp. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert B. Propst gave initial approval to the Maytag offer 
but set an Oct. 19 hearing to allow any objections from the buyers of the Magic 
Chef ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Maytag's Anniston plant has repackaged or reconditioned ovens that 
customers had returned. The company then sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160. 
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, Maytag, parent company of Magic Chef, denied any liability 
but agreed to halt the practice and to offer refunds of $35 to people who 
bought the ovens, primarily through Wal-Mart stores. The refunds would be cash 
payments of $25 and a $10 certificate toward the purchase of a Magic Chef 
product.
