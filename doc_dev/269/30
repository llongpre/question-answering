   Maytag Corp., trying to position itself in the increasingly heated international market for big household appliances, said it agreed to acquire Chicago Pacific Corp. for about $1 billion. 

   Aside from giving Maytag, based in Newton, Iowa, an expanded presence in the much-coveted overseas market, the acquisition of Chicago Pacific's Hoover division will give Maytag an entry into the U.S. market for household vacuum cleaners. 
The acquisition also may serve as a defensive measure for Maytag, which has been a rumored takeover candidate for months. 

   News of the $60-a-share tender offer sent Chicago Pacific's stock soaring $13.25, to close at $56.625, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
About 1.8 million shares changed hands. 
Shares of Maytag, meanwhile, dropped $2.75, to close at $23.75 in Big Board trading. 

   Recent consolidation has begun to create a global major-appliance industry, putting the heat on Maytag to find a big partner to compete, analysts said. 
In August, Whirlpool Corp. teamed up with N.V. Philips of the Netherlands in a giant joint venture to sell household appliances. 
And in 1986, Electrolux Group AB of Sweden acquired Cleveland-based White Consolidated Industries Inc., to establish itself as a global manufacturer. 

   "Maytag's acquisition was a matter of competitive necessity," said Martin Sankey, an analyst at First Boston Corp. 

   The timing for the planned Maytag acquisition is particularly important. 
After Western European nations drop internal trade barriers in 1992, the European market could be more difficult for U.S. companies to penetrate. 

   "'Maytag' doesn't mean anything outside the U.S.," said Daniel J. Krumm, chairman and chief executive officer of Maytag. 
"The appliance world is changing and it's important that we look outside the U.S. for growth." 

   Hoover doesn't market major appliances in the U.S. 
It does sell washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, and other products in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and elsewhere overseas. 
Of Hoover's 1987 revenue of about $1.25 billion, a Chicago Pacific spokesman said, about 65% came from overseas sales. 

   "Maytag is the leading laundry-appliance company in the U.S.," said Charles Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research. 
"Hoover is the leading laundry company outside the U.S. 
It's a good fit." 

   In the U.S., Hoover's vacuum cleaner lines will fill a gap in Maytag's offerings. 
Mr. Krumm said the business should be very similar to the laundry-equipment business: steady and predictable, with sales generated mostly through resale. 
And Hoover's strong brand-name recognition "is one heck of a franchise," said First Boston's Mr. Sankey. 

   Some analysts believe Maytag's planned acquisition may protect it from an unwanted takeover. 
The debt Maytag will likely incur from the transaction -- roughly $500 million -- would make it less attractive, and adding Hoover's operations would make Maytag a bigger fish to swallow. 
Maytag's stock has zigzagged in recent months on speculation that it may be acquired or taken private in a leveraged buyout. 
In May, Maytag strengthened its shareholder-rights defensive measure. 
Mr. Krumm said the acquisition wasn't planned as an anti-takeover move. 

   Chicago Pacific also has a furniture operation, which analysts note is an awkward fit with Maytag's appliance focus, and which likely will be sold to help finance the acquisition. 
The furniture lines could fetch about $300 million, estimates Mr. Ryan of Merrill Lynch. 
Mr. Krumm said Maytag hasn't made a decision on its plans for the furniture business. 

   Under terms of the acquisition, Maytag would offer $60 a share for as many as 6.4 million, or roughly 49%, of Chicago Pacific's common shares. 
The remaining shares would be converted into Maytag common stock at a rate of $60 of Maytag common stock for each Chicago Pacific share held. 

   Mr. Krumm said Maytag also plans to add three Chicago Pacific directors to Maytag's board, expanding it to 16.
