<HEAD>Newton Plant To Shut Down For A Week, First Production Suspension

   Maytag Corp. said today it will suspend all
production and some support operations for one week at its Newton
plant, the first such shutdown since November 1981.
   About 2,000 workers will be affected next week at the plant that
manufactures washers, dryers, dishwashers and in-sink food waste
disposers.
   ``Very strong first-quarter merchandising programming resulted
in dealers buying ahead and the short-term correction is needed to
bring factory and dealer inventories back into line,'' the company
said in its announcement.
   Spokesman Ron Krajnovich said the merchandising program involved
discounted sales to dealers as an incentive to buy Maytag
appliances.
   The company said the vast majority of the production employees
affected will receive unemployment compensation and supplemental
unemployment benefit payments during the period.
   It said production would resume April 11.
   Maytag is coming off its best year ever, with a profit of $152.7
million on sales of $1.92 billion in 1987.
   But when the company released its annual report earlier this
month, Maytag Chairman Daniel J. Krumm noted 1987 was the fourth
consecutive record year for the appliance industry.
   ``The industry's growth cycle is mature, and I believe demand
will relax slightly in 1988,'' Krumm said at the time. But he also
said he expected Maytag to outperform the industry as a whole.
