MAYTAG, one of the five large US home appliance manufacturers and owner of
the Hoover brand in Europe, said yesterday that it was forming a 'business
alliance' with Germany's Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, Europe's second-largest
household appliance group after the Swedish Electrolux group.
The two companies said the aim was to explore possibilities for marketing
each other's products. They would also examine opportunities for combining
customer service activities; for sourcing of components and materials; and
research and development work.
However, although a 'joint senior executive committee' will draw up
agreements, no ownership tie - via the purchase of shares - is expected.
The move is the latest in a series of alliances and acquisitions struck
between US and European domestic appliance manufacturers, as the industry
consolidates. Whirlpool, the biggest manufacturer of home appliances in the
US, recently took over Philips's domestic appliance business, based in
Holland; General Electric of the US linked in a joint venture with its UK
namesake; Maytag itself acquired the Hoover business four years ago.
Since 1988, however, Maytag has encountered problems in Europe, incurring a
Dollars 22.9m operating loss there in 1990, and a reduced Dollars 865,000
deficit last year on sales of about Dollars 500m. Last month, the US
manufacturer - which ranks fourth in its home market after Whirlpool,
General Electric and Electrolux - announced it was taking a Dollars 95m
charge against profits, mainly to cover a 'downsizing' of its European
operations.
Maytag's turnover worldwide in 1991 was Dollars 2.97bn, and net profits,
Dollars 79m. Its shares closed in New York yesterday up Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 14 3/4.
