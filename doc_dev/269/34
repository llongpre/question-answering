Searching for a good contemporary cookware? I used to recommend All-Clad 
cookware with confidence, having proven its cooking efficiency and cleaning 
ease. However when the line started disappearing from market shelves, I was 
disheartened. And so were some cookware shop owners. The good news from 
All-Clad Metalcrafters Inc., of Canonsburg, Penn., is that its 
precision-crafted cookware line is back in full production using all new 
machinery, thanks to the new takeover. Favored by professional chefs, the 
multi-ply cookware had limited distribution in the past and wasn't widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Now here's the only American cookware company (and one of only two in the 
world) that produces and bonds its own metals under one roof. As a matter of 
fact, it is the only company in this country that manufactures four types of 
cookware: copper, anodized aluminum, aluminum and stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
Every piece starts with a highly polished surface interior of 18/10 stainless 
steel bonded onto a thick core of pure aluminum for even heat distribution and 
retention. These layers are bonded to a wear-resistant outer layer, which could 
be any of the four metal types previously mentioned. 
</P>

For old-world charm and elegance, there's Cop-R-Chef ($366 for five-piece 
starter set, $160 for oval au gratin and $150 for oval omelet pan). It's tough 
on the outside with an extra thick copper layer and easy to clean with its thin 
stainless steel cooking surface that never needs to re-tinned. The solid brass 
handles are designed to stay cool even after lengthy cooking periods. Another 
style is LTD. ($260 for five-piece set), featuring a charcoal black exterior 
made of hardcoat anodized aluminum with resistance to scratch and chipping. One 
of my favorite open stock vessels here is the wok with a long handle and 
brightly polished domed cover. 
</P>
<P>
Master-Chef Cookware ($252 for six-piece set) offers abrasion-resistant brushed 
aluminum alloy exterior and same stainless steel exterior and aluminum core. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Magna-Core Multi-purpose Cookware ($220 for five-piece set), 
which has seven bonded layers of magnetic and conductive metals, making it 
ideal for induction cooking as well as conventional gas and electric ranges. 
The pieces are highly attractive with their shiny steel polish. 
</P>
<P>
 All All-Clad cookware types are available at Jordano's (Santa Barbara) and 
Williams Sonoma. The LTD cookware is available at Bullock's and Montana 
Mercantile (Santa Monica). Bed, Bath and Beyond (West L.A.) has Master Chef and 
LTD cookware.

Who says microwave dinnerware and cookware have to be plain white ceramic or 
plastic utensil? Go for more sophisticated porcelain service with microwave 
foods, whether they be dishes reheated or started from scratch. The new wave of 
microwave and conventional-oven safe cookware are available in pretty pastel 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of Villeroy &amp; Boch patterns would be happy to know about the 
additional new pieces that have been adapted for microwave cooking. Used with 
matching dinnerware groupings, or as a complement to other china, the patterns 
are Albertina, Mariposa and the popular Amapola and Basket (from $12.50 to 
$175). The cookware collection includes a variety of convenient sizes from 
single serving dishes to large casseroles and baking dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeroy &amp; Boch Microwave Cookware are available at Villeroy &amp; Boch 
Creation store (Beverly Hills) and Bullock's.

Fairwinds Dinnerware (from $40 for 20-piece set) consists of a wide variety of 
white porcelain pieces with fine floral prints in varied colors around the rim. 
All are dishwasher safe, does not stain and detergent proof. They can go from 
freezer to oven to table and retain heat well. 
</P>
<P>
Additional serving items are included in Fairwinds' Porcelain Plus line, which 
are designed with soft round corners that prevent hot spots when microwaving. 
The open stock units consist of various size rounded casseroles with cover, 
covered soup dishes, stackable cooker, divided dinner plates, beverage server, 
rectangular bakers, mugs and squarish hot lunch plates. The pieces are break 
and chip resistant; also the company offers a one-year warranty against 
manufacturing defects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairwinds Dinnerware and Porcelain Plus are available at May Company. 
</P>

Another porcelain microwaveable set is Noritake's freezer to oven to table 
collection called Gala Cuisine. The full range covers regular china pieces 
including an oval vegetable baker, a quiche/pie dish, a souffle/serving bowl, 
shallow as well as deep covered casseroles, roaster/baker. There are five 
patterns in the Gala Cuisine line, basically white with colored patterns: 
Copper Bud in blue and copper-red trim, multihued American Flowers, Clearlake 
with simple scalloped blue lines, blue Dutch Tile and the attractive pastel 
floral Coram pattern.

<P>
 Noritake's Gala Cuisine is available at Greco Gifts (San Pedro), Robinson's, 
Broadway, May Co. and Buffum's.
