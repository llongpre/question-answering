Maytag, the US home appliance manufacturer, is to sell off its Australian
and New Zealand-based white goods and floorcare appliance operations.
Maytag said it would prefer to float the division's shares on the stock
market. Analysts expect the sale to raise between ADollars 100m (USDollars
73m) and ADollars 150m.
The operations were formerly part of the Hoover group, which was taken over
by Maytag in 1988. Hoover (Australia), based in Sydney, makes and
distributes home appliances under brand names including Hoover and Admiral.
Mr Robert Dunkerley, managing director of Hoover (Australia), said the
businesses had been run 'largely independently' of the US parent. He
expected to finalise agreements permitting the operations to continue
marketing under their established brand names.
Maytag's decision to sell its Australasia operations through a flotation is
the latest in a series of such moves by overseas parents - notably British
companies - operating both in the manufacturing and financial services
spheres.
Pilkington announced similar plans earlier this year, as did Pirelli, the
Italian group, with its Australian cables business.
North Broken Hill Peko has sold its 19.1 per cent stake in base metals group
Pasminco for ADollars 233.1m, or ADollars 52.07m more than book value.
Reuter reports from Melbourne. NBH said that the buyer was CRA and that it
had now successfully completed a process of returning to managed core
businesses.
