   General Electric Co.'s unsolicited bid to
acquire appliance-maker Roper Corp. _ which already has agreed to a
merger with rival Whirlpool Corp. _ is seen as a competitive move
in a consolidating industry.
   GE on Monday offered to pay $45 a share, or $423 million, for
Roper's 9.4 million common shares outstanding.
   The unsolicited offer _ the first ever by GE _ topped the
Whirlpool offer of $37.50 a share, or $352.5 million, agreed to
last month by Roper.
   Analysts applauded the move by GE, the well-known appliance
maker which also has major interests in finance, broadcasting and
other manufacturing, which was seen as a thrust against a
competitor in the major appliance field.
   ``It makes sense and the numbers look real good,'' said Nicholas
Heymann, a vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York. ``In terms of what they're getting, they're trying to make a
statement with the price.''
   Roper's stock soared $11 to $48.37{ a share in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading Monday, indicating that speculators
expected a higher offer to emerge. GE fell 75 cents a share to
$43.37{ and Whirlpool dropped 62{ cents a share to $28.75.
   Roper, which is based in Augusta, Ga., makes gas and electric
ranges, including some of the ranges marketed by GE.
   Heymann said GE had carved out a niche in the gas range market
within the past three years, and was No. 3 in that business with 15
percent of the market.
   ``This year they are revamping the range line and I think they
would like to be vertically integrated in the gas line,'' Heymann
said. ``If they expand, they could vertically integrate and could
move up to 20 or 25 percent of the market.''
   ``It appears the ball is back in Whirlpool's court,'' Heymann
said.
   Roper, based in Augusta, Ga., said today it would meet with GE
representatives and give the company information it had requested.
Roper said it would inform its shareholders of the board's position
on the GE offer on or before March 18.
   Whirlpool expects to received the detailed GE offer today, said
Donna McLean, a spokeswoman for Benton Harbor, Mich.-based
Whirlpool.
   ``Right now, we're right where we were. We have not said we're
going to up the ante at all,'' McLean said.
   In a statement Monday, David Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said the company was still
committed to acquiring Roper as a major step in its growth strategy.
   Russ Leavitt, a senior analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. in New
York, said the merger attempt gives GE a ``potentially strengthened
position in the cooking business.''
   ``It also gives them an entree to Sears, which is a major
appliance retailer where GE has not been involved,'' Leavitt said,
referring to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. ``Roper is a Sears supplier of
cooking products and in the past GE has sold very little to Sears.
It could help them get into that market.''
   GE said it made the offer after learning from a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that Roper agreed to the Whirlpool
merger under threat of a ``unilateral takeover.''
   GE said that in discussions with Roper management last year,
Roper officials said they wanted the company to remain independent.
   ``We concluded that because we approached Roper on a friendly
basis and because Roper had been forced into play by the Whirlpool
offer, we should make an offer,'' said Jack Batty, a spokesman for
GE. ``We would describe our offer as competitive.''
   Batty also noted the industry consolidation stemming from
stepped up competition. Other major appliance mergers in recent
years included Maytag Corp.'s acquisition of Magic Chef Co. and the
acquisition of White Consolidated Industries by Sweden's Electrolux
AB.
   ``We feel that it would significantly strengthen GE's appliance
business in an increasingly competitive global market,'' Batty
said. ``We became impressed with the quality of their products.
...We think it would enhance our competitive position.''
   GE's tender offer expires April 1. Whirlpool's offer expires
March 25.
   In its fiscal year ended last July 31, Roper had net income of
$24 million on $703 million in sales. Gas and electric ranges
account for about 40 percent of sales.
   GE had 1987 revenue of $40.5 billion and net income of $2.9
billion. GE's major appliance business last year had a pretax
operating profit of $490 million on $4.72 billion in revenue.
