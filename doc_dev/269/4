   Thousands of people who bought Magic
Chef microwave ovens, thinking they were new, would collect $35
each under a proposed settlement of three lawsuits against the
manufacturer.
   Since January 1987, Maytag Corp.'s Anniston plant repackaged or
reconditioned ovens that customers had returned. The company then
sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160.
   Maytag denied any liability in the settlement proposal filed
Monday, but agreed to halt the practice and offer refunds to the
45,000 to 50,000 customers nationwide who bought the ovens. The
refunds would be cash payments of $25 and a $10 certificate toward
the purchase of a Magic Chef product.
   Maytag also agreed to pay up to $300,000 to the parties filing
the suits: the Alabama attorney general's office and a Birmingham
law firm.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert B. Propst gave initial approval
to the terms and set a hearing for Oct. 19 to allow any of the oven
buyers to voice objections.
   Dennis Wright, chief of the attorney general's consumer
protection division, said Maytag will send notices to customers who
mailed in their warranty cards and will purchase ads in newspapers
in cities where the ovens were sold.
