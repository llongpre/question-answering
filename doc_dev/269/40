   Appliance maker Maytag Corp. and Chicago
Pacific Co., the manufacturer of Hoover vacuum cleaners, announced
Thursday the completion of their $1 billion merger.
   The combination was approved by stockholders of both companies
and became effective with the filing of legal documents in Delaware,
where Maytag is incorporated.
   Maytag's acquisition of Chicago Pacific began Oct. 28 with a cash
tender offer, under which Maytag bought 6.4 million shares, or about
49 percent, of Chicago Pacific stock for $60 a share, or a total of
$384 million.
   The remainder of Chicago Pacific's shares were exchanged for
Maytag stock. The total cost of the transaction was put at nearly $1
billion.
   The merger creates a $3 billion a year corporation by bringing
Chicago Pacific's Hoover division and five furniture companies under
Maytag.
   Maytag, headquartered in Newton, had 1987 sales of $1.8 billion.
   Chicago-based Chicago Pacific Corp. was formed in 1984 in the
reorganization of the former Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific
Railroad. Its 1987 sales totaled $1.4 billion.
