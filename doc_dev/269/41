Slowly, yet surely, the old electric range surface is being replaced in 
kitchens all over the world by a sleek-looking cooktop. It's attractively 
smooth. No more ugly burners sticking out. No nooks and crannies to clean. 
(Remember how much extra time and effort you had to spend scrubbing those 
grease-laden coil systems and rusted drip bowls, lest they become an eyesore in 
the kitchen?) 
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary, high-tech, smooth top is made of a heat-resistant glass 
ceramic surface -- impervious to spills, grease and encrusted deposits. (Don't 
mistake this for the old ceramic surfaces that developed instant heat stains 
that were difficult to remove.) Today, this new cooking system accounts for 
about 60% of all electric range sales in West Germany, 50% in Switzerland and 
Austria and 45% in England. More than a dozen U.S. and Canadian appliance 
manufacturers are now incorporating this system into their electric ranges. 
Also, based on positive surveys, industry experts project an additional 75 
million purchases over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
By now you've probably seen this new cooktop surface in ranges by companies 
such as Amana, Dacor, Gaggenau, Caloric, Miele, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag, 
Modern Maid, Roper, Kitchen Aid, Sears, Tappan, Creda and Thermador. Flush to 
the countertop and looking extremely simple by way of its subtle smoothness, 
there's more to the system than meets the eye. An intricate ingenuity lies in 
both the composition of the glass panel as well as in the heating elements 
hidden beneath the cooking surface. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an inside story from the primary supplier of this product: Schott 
America, a subsidiary of Schott Glaswerke of Mainz, West Germany. Called the 
Ceran-Top-System, the unit consists of the following: a black glass-ceramic 
panel; the hidden heating elements and their mountings; a steel frame has a 
metallic finish or comes in one of several colors, and the burner controls. 
</P>
<P>
The attractive glass-ceramic panels are translucent, nonporous and available in 
several decorator designs with a wonderful variety of cooking zone placements. 
But beauty is not only skin-deep; these glossy panels are made to withstand 
constant temperatures of more than 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Sudden and severe 
temperature changes do not affect them and as a result they don't crack or 
warp. Another functional consideration is that they are designed to transmit 
heat efficiently from the hidden burners directly up to the cookware, with the 
rest of the surface remaining cool. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on individual wants and needs, the Ceran systems are available with a 
variety of electric heating options. The latest electric cooking systems 
include radiant, high-speed, ballast, "quicklight" and halogen, the last of 
which is attracting attention as an energy-saving concept. If you like the 
instantaneous on-and-off response of gas, the halogen elements uses halogen 
light bulbs that glow red when hot. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of this whole system is that all the heating coils and mountings are 
hidden beneath a glass panel and are designed with consideration for safety and 
maximum efficiency. The burners range from six to nine inches in diameter, some 
designed with dual circuits to accommodate two sizes of cook pots. Temperature 
limiters, which prevent the cooktop from overheating and aluminum pots from 
melting, are standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of pots, the manufacturer recommends a few simple rules of thumb to 
get the best performance: 
</P>
<P>
"Match the cookware and the cooking zone. The base of the pot or pan should be 
as wide as the cooking zone on which it's used to get maximum efficiency and 
shortest boiling times. 
</P>
<P>
"Use heavy cookware with flat, smooth bottoms. Nothing fancy is required. 
Commercially available pots and pans are fine. If made of metal, use thick 
gauge. All cookware when hot, should sit flush on the cooking surface. Pots and 
pans with flat, stainless-steel sandwich bottoms have produced the shortest 
boiling times and maximum efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning, of course, is a cinch. Ordinary spills can easily be cleaned with 
recommended cleaners applied to a moistened sponge or cloth. Avoid wool and 
abrasive cleaners and treat spills that contain sugar immediately. Burnt 
deposits can be easily removed with a razor-edged glass scraper. 
</P>
<P>
Many buyers are attracted to this system by the bright red glow of the heating 
elements that are visible through the glass-ceramic panel. Combined with this 
visible glow, an indicator light that remains on until the surface is cool to 
the touch ensures safe operation of the cooktop.
