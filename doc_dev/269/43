   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said it is beefing up its sales force and training programs as part of its push into the electronics "superstore" business. 

   As previously reported, the nation's largest retailer is combining its appliance and consumer electronics departments, adding name-brand goods at competitive prices, and stressing service in new Brand Central departments that open this week at 13 stores in Indiana. 

   In formally unveiling Sears's response to big electronics stores that have seized market share in recent years by stressing selection and low prices, Matthew A. Howard, senior vice president of merchandising, described Brand Central "an example of how we plan to run our businesses" in the future. 

   Chicago-based Sears's retailing operations have lagged the industry in recent years, and Brand Central is part of a broader effort to catch up. 
"Brand Central is a forerunner of a series of superstores that are being developed in other merchandise categories," Mr. Howard said. 

   As previously reported, Sears plans to test a free-standing Brand Central store in Louisville, Ky., later this year and to add Brand Central departments in most of its 819 stores by 1990. 

   Brand Central departments will carry more than 60 national brands in addition to Sears's exclusive Kenmore brand, which is the nation's best-selling appliance label. 
Until now, Sears has sold only Kenmore appliances and some RCA, Sony and other goods in addition to its LXI private-label home electronics products. 

   Sears said its Brand Central sales staff at the 13 Indiana stores has been expanded by 50%, or about 60 people. 
Sales personnel also have spent 60 to 70 hours in initial training sessions and will receive an additional four hours of training a week. 
In addition, Sears said it has changed compensation plans to give Brand Central sales people more of an incentive to sell merchandise. 

   Sears's advertising for the new departments will stress a Sears reputation for service and reliability. 
The ads will carry the tag line "the brands you want at the store you trust." 

   But Sears wasn't able to persuade Maytag Corp., an appliance maker with a reputation for quality and dependability, to start distributing Maytag products through Sears stores. 
Sears officials said talks are continuing with Newton, Iowa-based Maytag, which has an estimated 12% share of the U.S. appliance market. 
"Our hope is that they will see the light," said Eric Saunders, a senior vice president for administration and planning at Sears. 

   A Maytag spokesman said the company held talks with Sears and decided against distributing its Maytag brand products through Brand Central; he wouldn't comment beyond that. 
He noted that Maytag's Jenn-Air unit's ranges and dishwashers are among the products to be sold through Brand Central, however.
