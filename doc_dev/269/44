   Maytag Corp., its margins squeezed by recessionary
pressures, said first-quarter net fell by more than half, on
a 3.2% sales decline.
   The Newton, Iowa, appliance concern's net tumbled 54% to
$15 million, or 14 cents a share, from the year-earlier $32.6
million, or 31 cents. Sales dipped to $737.9 million from
$762.1 million.

   Sales and earnings of the company's major appliance
operation were down in North American markets, Maytag said,
and to a somewhat lesser extent its Hoover floor-care unit
also saw declines.
   In Europe, sales grew 20%, and the European segment's
operating loss narrowed to $2.6 million from $3.1 million.
But Maytag said that, except in Germany, where "real sales
growth was noted," the improvement in Europe was attributable
to favorable currency rates.
   Maytag expects "the first half of this year to reflect the
impact of the recession that began last fall," said Chairman
Daniel J. Krumm, adding that "hopefully business will be
better in the second half."
