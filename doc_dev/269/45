   Most of America may not be distressed by
government warnings to avoid homemade mayonnaise because of fears
that the raw eggs it contains could cause food poisoning.
   But to people like Harold McGee, who writes about kitchen
science and lore, something clearly had to be done.
   McGee, in a letter published in the Oct. 25 edition of the
journal Nature, said he had tested mayonnaise and other yolk-based
sauces made by first boiling the lemon juice or vinegar and yolks
in a microwave oven before adding the oil.
   ``The reason I published that article is to advise the public
health authorities,'' McGee said from his home in Palo Alto, Calif.
``My hope is that it will encourage the Centers for Disease Control
and the Food and Drug Administration and people like that to test
it.''
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture advises that eggs must reach
an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees to be considered free
of salmonella bacteria. This means the yolk and the whites have to
be firm, the USDA said.
   According to the American Egg Board, the risk of a
salmonella-infected egg is one in 10,000 at home. In restaurants or
cafeterias, the risk increases because so many eggs are used at
once and one could contaminate a bowlful.
   ``One of the things that really got me to thinking about it was
reading the paper and seeing a recipe from a distinguished French
chef for aioli calling for store-bought mayonnaise because he said
he just couldn't recommend the homemade,'' McGee said. ``I thought
there just had to be a way of getting around it.''
   Chef Julia Child has developed a mayonnaise using cooked eggs,
which she said is very easy to make and ``you'd never know'' the
difference. Barbara Kafka, author of ``Microwave Gourmet'' and the
``Microwave Gourmet Healthstyle Cookbook,'' has developed a recipe
for an eggless garlic mayonnaise.
   Once McGee, author of ``On Food and Cooking'' and ``The Curious
Cook,'' had a recipe he liked, he hauled his microwave oven to a
lab at Stanford University for tests.
   ``The experiments really showed that you can start with 5
billion bacteria in a single egg yolk and have none at the end,''
because the yolks reach or come very close to the boiling point, he
said.
   Acids - the lemon juice or vinegar - also help kill bacteria,
but ``only over a period of hours to days,'' McGee wrote in Nature.
``Under suitable biochemical and thermal conditions, egg yolks can
be boiled without curdling them or fatally compromising their
ability to produce smooth, stable emulsions.''
   The microwave ``really works like a charm for this. It works so
much better than the stove top,'' McGee said. ``It's the first
thing I've come across where it's just perfect.''
   McGee tried his handiwork on unsuspecting friends, who couldn't
tell the difference between it and mayonnaise with raw yolks. He
said he even had a hard time distinguishing them in a blind test.
   The strong cooked egg flavor people expect is absent because it
actually comes from the whites, he said.
   But Kafka, who tried McGee's method, said she had to use 1{ cups
of olive oil to tone down the cooked lemon taste.
   ``Is it a mayonnaise to kill for? No, but it does work,'' she
said.
   It is, however, mayonnaise that won't kill, said Bruce Stocker
of Stanford, in whose lab the tests were done. The cooking method
destroys the salmonella bacteria, he said.
   The test mayonnaise was not tasted because of safety rules in
the laboratory, Stocker said.
   And he hasn't made it at home. ``I'm not a mayonnaise maker
myself, but I think it's a good contribution. I'm not much of a
cook,'' he said.
   Kay Engelhardt, test kitchen supervisor at the Egg Board, said:
``I don't know how many people make their own mayonnaise. I don't
think it's a critical situation.''
