<LEADPARA>  WHEN you sit down to design a new kitchen, ask not what a kitchen should be
but what your kitchen should be.;   Some years ago, appliance configurations
and plumbing exigencies dictated more or less how kitchens could be arranged.
That's no longer true.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Adaptability and flexibility are the key words with today's appliances,
says Jim Krengel, a Certified Kitchen Designer who is a consultant and
educator in the field of kitchen design. Appliances have to meet people's
needs and not bust the budget, he said.;   And far from being constrained by
limited choices, today's consumers face too many choices.;   "There are
something like 967 styles and models of cook tops," Krengel said. "Trying to
unravel the choices and decide which is a good value is the hardest thing to
do.";   So what are designers doing? Krengel said one trend is to install more
than one of a certain kind of appliance.;   That's not necessarily two
identical ovens, he said: One might be a regular range oven, the other a more
specialized wall oven. Or it might mean two microwaves, one in the main
cooking area and one near a sitting area, where kids could prepare snacks
without being in the way.;   It might also mean two dishwashers, he said. As
long as it's not too far from drains and ventilation, there's no need to place
the dishwasher right next to the sink; why not put one facing the dining or
dish-storage area, with another near the sink for pots, pans and utensils?;  
It's true that in these recessionary times, it may be a struggle to acquire
one dishwasher, much less two. But there's nothing wrong with planning space
now for an acquisition when times improve.;   And not all design developments
are that expensive. Simply changing the traditional location of certain
appliances is another trend Krengel identified. The dishwasher, for instance.
It's not exactly easy to load or unload a dishwasher installed in the usual
way under the counter, Krengel said. But if you raise it off the floor about
eight inches, it becomes much easier to reach, especially for tall people or
older people who find bending difficult.;   A raised dishwasher shouldn't be
installed right next to the sink, he noted, because sinks need elbow room and
because you need somewhere to set things down when you take them out of the
machine. But the ease of loading and unloading may more than make up for the
extra distance.;   And then there's the microwave. When microwave ovens first
became prevalent, he said, they were considered counter-top appliances. Then
designers began moving them out of the way -- over the range (where they were
hard to reach) or under the counter.;   However, he said, a recent study at
the University of Minnesota on the ideal spot for microwaves found that 42 to
44 inches off the floor is perfect for most people. Conveniently, that makes
the spot above the raised dishwasher perfect for the microwave. The two
appliances can be installed attractively in a cabinet that incorporates
drawers or shelves.;   What about trendy new appliances -- ceramic stoves and
built-in refrigerators? They're fine if you have the money, says Krengel, who
is design director at the Maytag Kitchen Idea Center in St. Paul, Minn. But
it's not necessary to spend big bucks to get an efficient, attractive design.;
  "People are often looking for something new and exciting," he said, "but
old-fashioned calrod (electric heating element) ranges bring water to boil
faster than anything else." If you're concerned that electric burners continue
to heat after they're turned off, he suggested that you turn it off three to
four minutes early "and take advantage of the free heat.";   As for the
refrigerator, you can get a built-in look simply by recessing it into a wall
cavity. The three inches or so left between drywall walls in a 2-by-4 stud
wall leave only the door sticking out, he said. And the plug can go in the
cabinet above.;   Two of the most effective money-saving techniques, Krengel
said, are doing the work in stages, and doing some of the labor yourself. You
shouldn't have to give up the goal of a new kitchen.;   Besides, he added, "If
you're at the point where you're ready for a new kitchen, you probably need
one."  </TEXT>
