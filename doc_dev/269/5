   J. Hoyle Rymer has resigned as president of
the Magic Chef Co., which was founded by his grandfather S.B. Rymer
in 1916, officials of Maytag Corp. said Friday.
   Magic Chef, a manufacturer of cooking appliances such as stoves
and microwave ovens and marketer of a full line of major home
appliances, merged with Maytag in May 1986. Magic Chef is based in
Cleveland, Tenn.
   C. Wayne Creagan, president of Maytag's diversified products
division, will take over Aug. 1 for Rymer, Maytag Chairman Daniel
J. Krumm said.
   Rymer, 43, has been president of Magic Chef since 1978. His
resignation is effective Aug. 1.
   ``I think he just wants to pursue personal interests and other
business interests,'' said Maytag spokesman Jim Powell.
   Maytag had sales of $1.9 billion in 1987. Magic Chef had net
sales of $975 million in 1985, its last full year of operation
before the merger.
   Powell said the corporation does not break out sales figures for
its 14 divisions.
   Maytag previously reported that its profits in the first three
months of this year dropped to $32.5 million, or 43 cents a share,
from a record $41.2 million, or 49 cents a share, in the same
period last year.
   Rymer had served as the general manager of Magic Chef's
microwave division, company vice president of operations and was
elected to the board of directors in 1977.
   Creagan, 59, joined Maytag in 1948, working in the engineering
department and serving as the company's vice president of labor
relations. He became senior vice president of human resources when
Maytag and Magic Chef merged and was elected to Maytag's board of
directors in February.
