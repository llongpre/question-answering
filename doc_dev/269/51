   NEW YORK -- Not everyone sees the improving outlook for
home sales as a signal to buy stock in companies that make
refrigerators and washing machines.
   Because appliance sales often move in tandem with home
sales, a general perception that the slumping housing market
has touched bottom has sparked renewed interest in appliance
stocks.

   But many analysts are warning that the sentiment may be
ahead of the fundamentals and suggest it's too early to bet
home sales will revive the major appliance market.
   "It will be well into '92 before earnings are good," says
Jonathan Goldfarb, a major appliance company analyst for
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Housing starts rose 16.4% in February. That sharp
increase, lower mortgage rates and renewed consumer
confidence have some economists and analysts seeing better
times ahead for the housing industry.
   "The housing market is as good as its been in a while,"
says Richard Billy, a major appliance company analyst for
Prudential Securities. That's the main reason he is
recommending purchase of shares in Maytag Corp. and Whirlpool
Corp.
   About 20% of refrigerator, dishwasher, washing machine,
dryer and range sales are to new homes, analysts say. Sales
of existing homes also account for a major portion of major
appliance sales.
   Mr. Billy says the appliance industry, like the housing
industry, is near the bottom of a four-year declining cycle.
Just as appliance makers suffered the housing slump, Mr.
Billy sees them celebrating its rejuvenation.
   Yet even in recommending appliance stocks, Mr. Billy
concedes the industry's fundamentals are less than perfect.
And other analysts are questioning the wisdom of buying these
stocks now.
   Five companies account for more than 90% of the major
appliance market: Maytag, Whirlpool, General Electric Co.,
Raytheon Co. and White Consolidated Industries. With GE and
Raytheon diversified conglomerates and White Consolidated not
publicly traded, Maytag and Whirlpool are the only pure
appliance plays.
   Maytag and Whirlpool expanded their businesses in recent
years at the expense of profit margins, analysts say.
Domestic and overseas acquisitions added debt to previously
unleveraged balance sheets, increased costs, diluted earnings
and infringed on established brand franchises.
   More debt at a time when sales were sluggish taxed
corporate cash flow to the point where Maytag had to cut its
dividend by 44% in February.
   Many analysts believe Maytag and Whirlpool will go forward
in an improved U.S. sales environment less able to translate
incremental sales gains to the bottom line.
   Both companies made significant commitments to Europe in
recent years. Overseas operations now account for about
onethird of both companies' sales. The result is a greater
dependence on European market forces and less linkage to U.S.
markets.
   Jerry R. Herman, a major appliance-company analyst for the
Kemper Securities Group, says both companies must contend
with what may be a longer and deeper recession in the U.K.
and elsewhere in Europe. He says the dual effect of weak
sales and strong competition there could continue to pressure
near-term growth and margins. Mr. Herman says Maytag's Hoover
operations in the U.K. might suffer worst of all.
