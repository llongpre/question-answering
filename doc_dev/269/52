We are inundated these days with diet programs, diet supplements, diet systems 
-- all promising some magic weight loss something or other. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is one weight loss program that I can recommend. Experts from 
the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and chef Jacques Pepin have joined forces to 
produce "A Fare that Fits," a cookbook/video package that features recipes that 
taste good, leave you feeling full and yet are low in fat and calories. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret to losing weight -- and keeping it off -- is not in miracle diets 
but in a gradual weight loss of one to two pounds per week," says Karen 
Miller-Kovach, assistant director of nutrition services at the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Pepin, cookbook author and personal chef to three French presidents, developed 
the 60 recipes in the cookbook. The selections range from casual snacks to 
elegant meals. Menus were developed to contain no more than 30% of the calories 
from fats, and all recipes are designed to meet the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for 
Healthy Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritional information has been translated into acceptable dietary guidelines 
by Miller-Kovach, who helped Pepin make flavorful, filling, low-calorie cooking 
a reality. 
</P>
<P>
To make the following Pepin dish, buy whole turkey breasts and cut the steaks 
yourself, or ask the butcher to do it. If the steaks are one-half-inch thick, 
follow the cooking instructions below. Reduce the cooking time if they are 
thinner, however, and cook them longer if they are thicker. The sauce, finished 
with grapes and currants, is flavorful and lends itself to a party setting. 
</P>
<P>
After the turkey is sauteed, it can be kept for at least one-half hour in a 
200-degree oven or for one hour in a 180-degree oven. Any juices that emerge 
during cooking may be added to the sauce.
