   MAYTAG Corp. (Newton, Iowa) -- The company named its
president, Leonard H. Hadley, as chief executive officer,
effective April 28. Mr. Hadley, 57 years old, succeeds Daniel
J. Krumm, 65, who remains as chairman of the maker of kitchen
and laundry products. Mr. Krumm has been Maytag's chief
executive since 1974. Mr. Hadley's appointment was expected.
Maytag named him as president and chief operating officer a
year ago, and he has been regarded for some time as heir
apparent to the chief executive's post.
