Maytag, the US home appliance manufacturer, is abandoning plans to float its
Australian and New Zealand-based white goods and floor care appliance
operations.
It blamed the recent deterioration and weakness of the Australian
stockmarket, especially for new offerings, and said it could see greater
value in retaining the operations, rather divesting them 'into a down
market'.
The decision to abandon the flotation of Hoover Australia follows several
days of rumours that the sale was in trouble. Earlier in the week, there was
speculation that the price at which the shares were to be sold might have to
be cut from ADollars 1 to 85 cents because of lack of interest among
institutional investors and potential sub-underwriters.
Maytag first announced plans to sell the businesses in May, saying it would
prefer to do so by way of a stockmarket flotation. The operations were
formerly part of the Hoover group, which was taken over by Maytag in 1988.
Hoover Australia is reckoned to have about 18 per cent of the white goods
market in its home country. Analysts had expected the sale to raise between
ADollars 100m (Dollars 73m) and ADollars 150m.
