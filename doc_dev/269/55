<TEXT>     But about two years ago, at 485 pounds, he was not so happy.;    "I got to
an uncomfortable weight and I had to do something," he said.;    First, he
tried powdered diet products and even got creative with them, inventing new
recipes.;    "I got sick of it and decided it was time to get serious. With my
ability to cook, I changed to food," he said.;    For a while he experimented
with macrobiotic cooking, a vegetarian approach emphasizing whole grains and
high fiber, then moved on to a variety of dishes supplanting his usual heavy
hand with butter, cream and roux with a lighter touch.;    The result was a
130-pound weight loss, enough to make him mobile in the kitchen. At his
present weight, 360 pounds, he is comfortable.;    "I can work a station," he
said. In restaurant lingo, that means cooking non-stop as customers place
orders, which Prudhomme did for three months after the weight loss. "I hadn't
done that in years." And he no longer does it, having resumed his usual role
of overseeing the kitchen. "Now I don't have to. I know I can.";    With his
cholesterol, blood pressure and other vital statistics well within normal
range, Prudhomme tends not to worry about excess weight as long as he's
comfortable.;    "I've had a weight problem since I was 8 years old," he said.
The last time he can remember being thin was at a photography session when he
was 4 years old.;    Since weighing more than 500 pounds as a teen-ager,
Prudhomme has done his time with diets, fluctuating between 350 and 500 pounds
and once even fasting for 40 days.;    "If it applies to me and losing weight,
it's not an article, it's a book" he said.;    What are his weaknesses?;   
"If I have a plan, a full-proof plan, and know what I'm having, I can deal
with it," he said of dieting. "But if I don't have it, I eat anything.";   
Sweets used to be a problem. "I was always a binger," he said. He would
refrain, then buy a quart of ice cream and eat the whole thing.;    "I can't
eat sweets every day or I'd weigh 1,000 pounds," he said.;    For a while, the
chef hired an experienced cook who prepared low-calorie meals for him. Then,
he began creating his own diet dishes and stuck to them almost exclusively for
about one year. After losing 100 pounds he ventured to two diet meals a day
and one off the diet.;    Keeping it off;  Although the weight loss was an
achievement, he's happiest about keeping it off for one year with the modified
diet.;    Says his wife K., "When Paul decides he's going to diet, there's
nothing that keeps him from it -- except no food at all.";    "I try never to
beat myself up about gaining weight," he says. "If I go off for a day or two,
I try to forgive myself.";    Prudhomme admits his recipes aren't the easiest,
and defers to his sister Enola and her new light-recipe Cajun cookbook,
"Low-Calorie Cajun Cooking" (Hearst Books, 1991, $17.95). But for the cook who
doesn't mind putting some time into diet dishes, Prudhomme has come up with
some winners.;    His Mullacalong Chicken makes his eyes roll just talking
about it. As for sweets, "you can do some neat things with artificial
sweetener," he said. One example is a flan he likes to make with canned skim
milk, pureed cottage cheese, eggs and arrowroot.;    Cook cooks;  Prudhomme
has no plans to publish a diet cookbook, though at one time he did. His sister
Enola had thought up the idea of a family cookbook around the same time.
William Morrow, publisher of Prudhomme's first cookbook, wanted Paul to write
the family book so the siblings swapped ideas. "The Prudhomme Family Cookbook"
was published in 1987 and now Enola's low-calorie book is just out. Paul's
next book, "Seasoned America," is scheduled to hit bookstores in the fall.;   
Meanwhile, Prudhomme is happy to pass on his successful light recipes to
others wanting to lose weight. Here are some of his favorites.;   MULLACALONG
CHICKEN;  2 tablespoons Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic;  1 1/2 teaspoons
turmeric;  1 1/2 teaspoons dried leaf cilantro;  1/2 teaspoon ground ginger; 
1 teaspoon dry mustard;  1 teaspoon curry powder;  2 cups corn kernels
(preferably fresh, about 4 ears);  5 1/2 cups defatted chicken stock;  8
boneless skinless chicken breasts all visible fat removed (about 1 pound, 10
ounces, total weight);   Olive oil spray;  2 cups chopped onions;  2 teaspoons
grated lemon peel;   Juice of 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons);  1 red bell
pepper, seeded, stemmed and cut into strips;  2 packets Equal or other
low-calorie sweetener;   Combine Poultry Magic with the other seasonings in a
small bowl. Place the corn kernels with one-half cup stock in a blender and
process about 2 minutes. (Mixture should be somewhat coarse, not smooth.);   
Place chicken breasts in a bowl, coat them with 2 tablespoons of the seasoning
mixture, and rub in thoroughly with your hands.;    Preheat a large pot or
Dutch oven (preferably cast iron) over high heat. Lightly spray each chicken
breast with olive oil spray on one side, and place sprayed-side-down in a
single layer in the heated pot. When brown on the first side, turn (no need to
spray again) and brown the second side. While the second side is browning, add
the chopped onions. Remove the chicken when brown. Cover the brown on the
bottom of the pot with the onions and cook about 2 minutes, or until onions
are sticking hard. Stir the pureed corn onto the onions, add 2 teaspoons
seasoning mix and scrape the bottom of the pot well. (You may need a metal
spatula to do this properly.);    Cook, scraping from time to time, 6 to 7
minutes or until the corn looks almost like a golden brown roux. Add the
remaining seasoning mix, the lemon peel and lemon juice and cook one minute.
Stir in 2 cups stock, scrape the pot bottom and bring to a boil. Add the
remaining 3 cups stock; stir well and cook, uncovered, 15 minutes. Add the
chicken breasts and red pepper, cover and cook 5 minutes, or until chicken is
tender and juicy. Turn off heat and stir in the sweetener.;    To serve, place
a chicken breast on each plate and add one-half cup of sauce. Top with 2 or 3
strips of red pepper. Makes 8 servings; approximately 250 calories per
serving.;   MACARONI AND CHEESE;  1 1/2 cups chopped onions;  3/4 cup chopped
celery;  2 tablespoons Chef Paul Prudhomme's Pork and Veal Magic;  1/2 cup
defatted chicken stock;  5 egg whites;  1 (12-ounce) container low-fat cottage
cheese;  1 (12-ounce) can evaporated skim milk;  1 to 2 teaspoons salt
(optional);  10 cups cooked small elbow macaroni (from 5 cups uncooked);  6
ounces low-fat cheddar cheese (7 grams fat per ounce), shredded;   Preheat
oven to 375 degrees.;    Heat a 10-inch skillet over high heat. Add chopped
onions, celery and Pork and Veal Magic. Cook 2 minutes, then stir to blend in
seasoning. When vegetables begin to stick hard to the pan (about 2 to 3
minutes), add 1/4 cup stock and scrape up the brown on the pan bottom, stir
well and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Turn heat down to medium and stir. Cook until
vegetables begin to stick hard again, about 4 to 5 minutes, and add the
remaining 1/4 cup stock. Scrape up pan bottom, stir well and continue cooking
another 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.;    Place the
egg whites in a food processor. Process 30 to 45 seconds, or until the egg
whites are nice and frothy (but not until they make peaks!). Add the cottage
cheese and the evaporated milk and process. Don't let the mixture get too
smooth; a bit of lumpiness in the cottage cheese will give the dish more
texture. Add the cooled mixture from the skillet and process again, about 20
seconds. Taste and add salt if you desire. Place the cooked, drained macaroni
into a bowl, pour the sauce over and mix well. Pour into an unbuttered
casserole, sprinkle the cheddar cheese on top and bake at 375 degrees for 35
to 40 minutes, or until brown and bubbly.;    Makes 10 servings, approximately
235 calories per serving.;   HOT CHICKEN SALAD;  3 skinless, boneless chicken
breasts, about 4 ounces each, for a total of 12 ounces, cut crosswise in
strips;  2 teaspoons Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic;  1 teaspoon softened
reduced-calorie margarine;  6 cups spinach, rinsed, stems removed;  1/2 medium
onion, julienned;  4 to 5 ribs celery, cut in diagonal slices;  1 fennel bulb,
cut strips (optional);  2 carrots, cut in short sticks;  1/4 each red, green
and yellow bell peppers, cut in strips (about 2 ounces each);  1/2 medium
sweet potato, peeled, cut into sticks;  1/2 medium white potato, peeled, cut
into sticks;  1 cup vegetable stock (from the cooked vegetable);  1 tablespoon
soy sauce;  1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce;  1 tablespoon tamari;  1
tablespoon cider vinegar;  3 packets Equal or other low-calorie sweetener;  
If you can't get tamari, double the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons.;    Combine
the chicken strips with the Poultry Magic and margarine. Mix well and set
aside.;    Fill a large pot with water (about 5 quarts), place a strainer over
the pot so the bowl of the strainer is submerged, and bring water to a rolling
boil. Place the spinach in the strainer and cook 2-3 minutes. Drain and place
spinach in a small container. Repeat the same procedure with each vegetable
separately, cooking the onions, celery, fennel and carrots each 2 minutes; the
peppers and the sweet potatoes each 1 1/2 minutes; and the white potato sticks
about 3 minutes. Keep each vegetable warm in its own separate container,
preferably covered and reserve the cooking liquid.;    Heat a large skillet to
about 350 degrees. Bronze the chicken over high heat, turning it as it browns.
When the chicken is all a rich, bronze color, remove from the skillet.;   
Keeping the same skillet over high heat, add 1 cup of the vegetable stock (the
water in which the vegetables cooked) to the pan, scraping up all the browned
bits from the chicken off the bottom. Stir in the soy sauce, Worcestershire,
tamari, and vinegar. Cook 2 minutes, remove from heat and add the sweetener.; 
  Arrange a thin bed of spinach on each of four 10-inch plates. Artfully
arrange small groupings of the vegetables around the edges of the plates.
Mound one-quarter of the chicken in the center of each plate. Sprinkle about
one-quarter cup of the dressing over each salad, and serve.;    Serves 4;
approximately 252 calories per serving.  </TEXT>
