MAYTAG, the fourth largest appliance manufacturer in the US, yesterday
unveiled a sharp improvement in first-quarter profits, writes Nikki Tait in
New York.
The after-tax figure rose from Dollars 15m a year ago, to Dollars 28.5m, on
sales up from Dollars 737.9m to Dollars 753.2m.
Maytag noted that total core product sales for the US appliance industry had
been flat during this period, but said that its own performance was helped
by Hoover's North American floor care business and private label sale of
laundry equipment.
