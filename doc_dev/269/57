<HEAD>Celebrated French Chef Raymond Oliver Dead at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Raymond Oliver, one of the greatest French chefs of
the century and author of 26 books on cooking, died Monday after a
long illness, his family announced. He was 81.
   Born at Langon in the celebrated Bordeaux food region in 1909,
Oliver was the son and grandson of cooks. His maternal grandmother
gave him cooking lessons at an early age and he began his
apprenticeship under his father at age 15.
   In 1948, he purchased one of the great Parisian restaurants, Le
Grand Vefour, and turned it into an exclusive dining spot for
celebrities like politician Andre Malraux, actor Jean Cocteau and
writer Colette.
   Oliver detested the light nouvelle cuisine popular in recent
years. His specialty was perfecting the rich cuisine of his
Bordeaux youth: foie gras, Sauterne, dove and caviar.
   ``The important thing is design,'' he once said. ``To make good
cuisine, it's necessary to have a solid base.''
   La Vefour earned Michelin's prized third star five years after
Oliver bought it. He ran it until his retirement at 75 following a
terrorist bombing at the restaurant.
   Together with Guy Gerard, Jean-Claude Vrinat and Jacques
Maniere, Oliver was one of the most highly regarded chefs of his
era. He won several of France's top honors, including Officer of
the Legion of Honor.
   But his gift of communication elevated Oliver above his
contemporaries. He was a prolific writer and from 1953 to 1968
played host to the country's most popular television food program,
``Art and Magic From the Kitchen.''
   A series of recorded recipes, ``Cuisinorama,'' sold hundreds of
thousands of copies and Oliver defended French cuisine in lectures
and seminars in the United States, Japan, South Africa and Iceland.
   He was married and had four children. One of his sons
established a chain of restaurants in French train stations. His
family did not disclose the cause of death, and other details on
survivors were not disclosed.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.
