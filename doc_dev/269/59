   The new incarnation of ``the loneliest
repairman in town'' introduced himself to Maytag Co. workers
Friday, when officials marked 40 years of making washing machines
and other appliances at their plant here.
   Gordon Jump, an actor best known for his portrayal of the
bumbling station manager Arthur Carlson in the defunct television
series ``WKRP in Cincinnati,'' is the new ``Ol' Lonely'' repairman
in Maytag commercials.
   ``I have a Maytag washer and dryer in our home. I could not be
more proud to represent any product or group of people,'' Jump told
workers at Maytag's Plant No. 2.
   Jump, 56, succeeded actor Jess White in March as the Lonely
Repairman in March. White spent 21 years as the character devised
to promote a product the company said was so dependable the service
department rarely was called. He is now a Maytag consultant.
   Plant No. 2 started production on April 4, 1949. Since then, its
workforce has grown from about 450 employees to about 2,500, and it
has produced about 42 million automatic washing machines and other
appliances, said Ron Krajnovich, Maytag Co.'s public relations
director.
   Maytag, one of the units of the more than $3 billion Maytag
Corp., also employs an additional 1,000 people in another Newton
location.
   Before Plant No. 2 and its automatic products, Maytag had been
making wringer washing machines and other appliances for about 40
years.
   ``I remember when most of the plant was just dirt floor. The
construction people actually outnumbered the Maytag employees,''
said Bob Lister, who joined the company in March 1949.
   ``We had hopes it would continue to expand, but none of us could
foresee this kind of growth,'' said Paul Provin, an engineer who
joined Maytag in January 1942 and will retire in December. ``It's
been a super good place to work.''
