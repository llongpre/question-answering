   Maytag Corp. said Thursday it is discussing
the sale of its Jenn Industries and Magic Chef Air Conditioning
operations as part of its effort to concentrate on major appliances.
   Maytag Chairman Daniel J. Krumm would not identify the potential
buyers for Jenn Industries of Indianapolis, Ind., and Magic Chef of
Bellevue, Ohio.
   ``These are good operations, but the products they manufacture
do not serve markets that are significant to Maytag, nor do they
contribute substantially to our earnings,'' Krumm said in a
statement.
   Combined sales of the two companies totaled $86.7 million in
1987, when Maytag reported total net sales of $1.9 billion.
   Jenn Industries, which employs about 100 people, makes power
exhaust units and ventilation equipment. Magic Chef, with about 400
employees, makes residential furnaces and air conditioners.
   ``Selling these operations will permit us to concentrate efforts
and financial resources in our core businesses of full-size major
appliances and vending equipment, which is where we can achieve the
latest long-term benefit,'' Krumm said.
   The planned sales are part of a reorganization that began
shortly after Maytag and Magic Chef merged in 1986. The company's
main brands include Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag
and Norge.
