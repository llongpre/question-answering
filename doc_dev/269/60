   Maytag Corp. said it began its $60-a-share tender offer for as much as 6.4 million shares, or 49%, of Chicago Pacific Corp.'s common outstanding. 

   The appliance maker has agreed to buy Chicago Pacific for about $1 billion as part of an effort to position itself in the international market for big household appliances. 
Chicago Pacific, based in Chicago, makes Hoover vacuum cleaners and other products. 

   After the tender offer is completed, Maytag said, each remaining Chicago Pacific share will be converted into between 2.1429 and 2.7272 Maytag common shares. 
The final ratio will be based on the market price of Maytag stock in a specified period. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Maytag closed at $24.25 a share, up 12.5 cents. 
Chicago Pacific closed at $55.125, up $1.50. 

   The offer, which expires Nov. 28, depends on at least four million Chicago Pacific common shares being validly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration date, among other conditions.
