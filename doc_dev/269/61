Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, has sold 450 former
Chef &amp; Brewer pubs for Pounds 108m.
The pubs have been bought by a private company created by Mr Michael Cannon,
the former chairman of JA Devenish, the pub group which was bought by
Greenalls last year for Pounds 214m.
Mr Cannon's new vehicle, the Magic Pub Company, has sold on 168 of the pubs
for about Pounds 30m to Labatt, the Canadian brewing group which has been
expanding in the UK. Labatt now has 526 pubs, making it the UK's fourth
largest independent pub retailer.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle gave an undertaking to sell 450 pubs from the
1,650-strong Chef &amp; Brewer chain when it purchased them from Grand
Metropolitan in November. It still must sell a further 700 pubs within a
year to get below the 2,000 ceiling set by the government's 1989 Beer Order.
Mr Cannon acquired a half-interest in a Bristol pub for Pounds 30,000 in
1974. He went on to float Inn Leisure on the USM in 1982. In 1986 Inn
Leisure's 40 outlets merged with Devenish's 314, and Mr Cannon became
chairman and chief executive of the full group the following year.
Mr Cannon, 52, whose family's stake in Devenish was worth Pounds 26m at the
time of last summer's takeover, said his wife had thought he was going to
retire - but he could not resist this opportunity.
He said: 'This deal creates at a stroke a major new independent force in the
highly-rated free trade pub sector. Over the next few years we will make a
sizeable investment in refurbishing and upgrading the estate and believe we
can enhance its performance significantly.'
Mr Michael Izza, managing director of Labatt UK's retailing said: 'Part of
our plan for growth is to buy pubs in order to own our retail distribution.
We intend to carefully expand our pub retailing interests as quality
locations become available.'
Labatt brands are distributed in more than 10,000 UK pubs and its Canadian
lager is one of the top 10 lager brands.
Mr Cannon and his team were advised by Flemings. The Pounds 100m financing
package includes Pounds 57m of senior debt underwritten by Flemings and
Lloyds Bank. The equity came from management themselves and a Pounds 23m
syndicate led by CINVen.
