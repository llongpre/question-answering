<LEADPARA>  SUSAN Stagi stroked a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove. Smitten, she ran her hand
over its salt and pepper shakers and clock and onto its shiny chrome top and
black cast-iron burners.;   "See how the shakers are designed to blend in with
the lines of the stove? It has the look of an old Caddy, with fins and stuff,"
she said. "Having one of these is like having an antique, a classic car parked
in your kitchen."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The O'Keefe &amp; Merritt, for which Susan and Marcus Stagi are asking $1,500,
is one of the old-fashioned ranges that pass through the San Jose Stove Works,
a combination hospital/showroom on North 10th Street.;   Not too far away at
another stove clinic, Jose Abundiz reached into a drawer and pulled out a
knob.;   "This is gold," said Abundiz. "It is a handle for a Wedgwood stove.
We hide them here. And I'll only sell them to someone if they cry real hard to
me.";   Abundiz, who says his Appliance Depot on Auzerais Street is the
nation's largest graveyard for kitchen appliances, and the Stagis are among a
number of entrepreneurs and homeowners who are caught up in a nationwide wave
of passion. That passion is a love for the old-fashioned stoves with which our
grandmothers and mothers baked their high and fragrant pies, grilled their
hotcakes and roasted their Thanksgiving turkeys.;   O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stoves
and Wedgwoods are brands that are no longer manufactured. The best of them
were produced in the 1940s and 1950s. About 10 years ago, amid the boom in all
things culinary, people began to take a fresh look at the stoves. They
discovered they are sturdily built, cook very well, hold their value like most
antiques and -- in the case of people who were renovating older homes -- lend
character to ambiance and decor.;   The very latest twist on the timeless,
reconditioned O'Keefe &amp; Merritts and Wedgwoods is colorizing. The heartland of
this trend is in Los Angeles. There, several companies are applying new
porcelain to the stoves in bright colors. Some stoves have sides that are
orange, knobs that are blue and doors that are green (but NOT the avocado of
the 1960s) -- but the colors vary according to a customer's desires. One
designer is applying animal decals and the like. The prices for the specially
colored stoves begin at $2,000.;   In Northern California, reconditioned
O'Keefe &amp; Merritts and Wedgwoods selling for between $700 and $2,000 are
increasingly popular, but the desire for color is still muted. At Reliance
Appliance in Berkeley, Doug Harbo said he's seen an increase in interest in
colored stove tops and handles, but no real market yet for zany colors on the
entire stove.;   Subcontract porcelain; Those who recondition old stoves don't
redo the porcelain themselves. They send it to Porcelain Patch &amp; Glaze Co. of
Oakland, the only stove enameler in the Bay Area. Professional porcelain
refinishing requires baking the porcelain at high temperatures.;   But white
is the classic way to go.;   "I didn't want a color. I like white," said
Roxanne Leitzke of Willow Glen. Leitzke was looking for an antique
refrigerator to blend with the style of her home when she came upon an O'Keefe
&amp; Merritt made in the 1940s at Appliance Depot.;   "I wanted to keep my whole
kitchen in the era of the house. I think the old stoves look better all
around," she said. "And I believe they also cook better." After replating and
reglazing, Leitzke figures her stove is worth about $1,000.;   For Merrily
Milbert of San Jose's Rose Garden area, aesthetics, sturdiness, and the
excellence of its cooking caused her to lay out about $1,500 for a
hard-to-find 1947 Wedgwood with six burners, two ovens and two broilers.;  
"I'd been looking for about two years when I saw this at the Appliance Depot.
I bought it on the spot. Our other alternative was to go commercial, but they
are not as nice-looking. Mine has a chrome top and chrome handles. It has an
art deco clock," she said.;   One of the Stagis' happy customers is Robert
Brito, 29, a chef at Andare Gourmet Takeout on South Bascom Avenue in
Campbell. Brito wanted a good stove for his home, where he experiments with
new recipes. He priced stoves in department stores, but realized he was in
love with the Wedgwoods he grew up with.;   He paid $1,200 for a 1950s
Wedgwood -- with four burners, two ovens, two broilers and a grill.;   "I love
it. It was worth every penny," he said.;   Brito, with his knowledge of
cooking, said he finds that the Wedgwood bakes better than conventional ranges
because it has a thermostat that keeps oven heat more consistent than systems
that flick on heat in a burst of power. He likes the heavy cast-iron burners
with simmer plates.;   Don Cook, a salesman for Whole Earth Access in
Berkeley, said he thinks the reconditioned stoves "have beautiful character,"
but a few disadvantages. Key among those is that they have pilot lights, which
eat gas and are not energy efficient, and they require special venting.
Another is that many of the ovens are smaller than the ones consumers became
accustomed to with more modern stoves.;   But people enamored with the old
stoves ignore these blemishes and say many of their features are endearing.
For example, one style has a window in the back of the stove that serves as a
periscope into the oven. Flick on the oven light and the food in the oven can
be viewed without opening the door. Many have shelves that fold up and down.
Called mother-in-law shelves, according to Susan Stagi, they were to be pulled
over the burners when the stove top was not clean and company was coming.;  
It takes three or four days to recondition an old stove. There is the matter
of accumulated rust and grease, and the more time-consuming problem of
replacing parts that are damaged or missing.;   Replacement parts; That's
where Abundiz' graveyard comes in. Over the years, people have paid him to
haul away their discards. Many times, an old O'Keefe &amp; Merritt or Wedgwood is
among the trash. He salvages the stoves, often using parts from two stoves to
repair another one.;   Abundiz said he gets requests from all over the world
for parts. He has about 60 sets of salt and pepper shakers. Certain sets go
for as much $80, but most dealers sell them for less if you buy a stove.;  
Leitzke bought her beloved O'Keefe &amp; Merritt from Abundiz in May. She said
good-naturedly that Abundiz hasn't found her the exactly right set of salt and
pepper shakers that go with it.;   She said she knows he will eventually, and
"it's certainly worth the wait."  </TEXT>
