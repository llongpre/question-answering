   Import-starved consumers are on a spree,
buying candy and washing machines from the United States, French
wines and lingerie, Spanish ceramic tile, Japanese stereos, even
watering cans from Australia.
   Mexico's fledgling open market policy, which includes greatly
reduced import duties, has incited the biggest change in shopping
habits this country has seen in decades.
   ``It's like being in the United States,'' shopper Hector Juarez
said as he roamed Imagine, a 3-month-old store offering
state-of-the-art household goods and sophisticated novelty items
from around the world.
   Mexicans who wanted a microwave oven or an American refrigerator
used to patronize a black market, but within the last year that has
changed.
   ``We bought a Whirlpool washing machine from a local dealer. It's
nice to have the option,'' said Juarez.
   Another new store offers the latest in electronic goods and major
appliances from the United States, Japan and West Germany, while
huge signs announcing ``imported merchandise'' point the way to new
foreign goods sections in supermarkets and department stores.
   In Mexico City, imported bottled water has become the latest
fancy of the middle and upper classes.
   Mexico's former industrial protection policy required import
duties of up to 100 percent. With few exceptions, the restriction
effectively denied consumers access to foreign-made products by
making them too expensive.
   As a result, consumers complained, national manufacturers got
greedy and lazy, charging exorbitant prices for inferior merchandise
and rarely bothering to expand product lines.
   But Mexico, facing skyrocking inflation that reached 167 percent
in 1987, joined the international General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade in 1986, lowering import duties to 20 percent or less.
   The change was aimed partly at forcing domestic producers to
reduce prices and raise quality. Another goal was to increase
exports of manufactured goods by letting producers import raw
materials more cheaply.
   The boom in consumer imports has been escalating since mid-1988.
   ``It's helped control inflation because Mexican manufacturers
can't raise prices because the products coming from the other side
are cheaper,'' said Jose Luis Mastretta, a Chamber of Commerce
official in Monterrey, northern Mexico's largest and richest city.
   Inflation fell to about 50 percent in 1988.
   Under the relaxed tariffs, most foreign items cost an average of
5 percent to 35 percent above what they might cost in the United
States.
   An American candy bar costs about 55 cents, while a compact disc
that sells for about $16 in the United States goes for $19 here.
   ``People here are used to spending in dollars and they
automatically compare prices,'' said Imagine manager Miguel
Longoria. ``They'll pay 25 to 30 percent above U.S. prices, but if
it's more they'll go to the other side of the border.''
   From the United States, imports include cake mixes, clothes,
compact discs, barbecue grills, furniture, refrigerators and washing
machines.
   Total imports from January through October of 1988 increased by
55 percent to $15.2 billion, compared with the same period in 1987,
Bank of Mexico statistics show. Imports of consumer goods alone grew
by 150 percent.
   The higher imports hurt Mexico's balance of payments at the end
of 1988, reducing what had been a strong surplus. Nonetheless,
business economists don't expect a prolonged bout of voracious
import consumption because many Mexicans simply don't have the money.
   ``It's not an invasion of products because the buying power of
the the average Mexican is very limited. We're still in a
recession,'' Mastretta said.
   Most of the consumer goods sold here are aimed at middle-and
upper-class consumers, only about 25 percent of the population.
Nevertheess, those with a choice are buying imports, salesmen said.
   ``The client who comes in to buy a refrigerator is going to leave
with an American one,'' said Juan Angel Rodriguez, manager of the
Liverpool department store's appliance department.
   Rodriguez said 80 percent of the refrigerators, washing machines,
dryers and stoves he sells are American. Although Mexican prices are
becoming competitive, manufacturers have not yet raised quality to
match the imports.
   ``People are demanding higher quality. What they get with the
national brands are breakdowns, breakdowns, breakdowns,'' Rodriguez
said.
   At Liverpool, an imported Speed Queed clothes dryer with 18-pound
capacity and digital controls cost $680. The closest Mexican-made
equivalent, an Easy brand nondigital 11-pound dryer, cost $600.
   A Mexican-made washing machine that used to cost the equivalent
of $608 now has been reduced to about $470. An imported Maytag
washing machine was on sale for the same price.
