other manufacturers in Britain

JAPANESE-OWNED manufacturing companies in Britain have largely avoided
making staff redundant, in spite of taking a battering in the worst
recession since Japanese inward investment started more than 20 years ago.
More than half the Japanese-owned manufacturing companies in the UK have
reduced staffing or the number of hours worked in the past year, according
to an FT survey of 40 of the biggest companies.
They have made far fewer redundancies than British manufacturing as a whole,
and some - notably motor vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers - are
still recruiting.
Companies in engineering, construction equipment and business machines have
been most affected by the recession.
Even here, compulsory redundancies are a last resort. Most companies have
sought other ways to trim output.
Some have laid off temporary workers. NEC's business-equipment-making
operation in Telford, Shropshire, has shed about 130 temps. The company
said: 'It will be at least six months before we recruit in any quantity.'
Others have eliminated overtime or frozen recruitment. One photocopier maker
has lost almost 10 per cent of its 700 staff in a year through natural
wastage.
More unusual solutions have included closing on alternate Fridays, as at
electronics group Hitachi at Aberdare, Mid Glamorgan, or extending Christmas
holidays, as at bearings maker NSK in Peterlee, County Durham.
Several companies negotiated with unions to skew hours worked towards the
second half of the year. Matsushita Electric, which makes microwave ovens
and television sets in Cardiff, has reduced the hours worked in a week by 15
per cent for the first four months of the year and increased them by the
same amount to meet seasonal demand in the last four months.
In a few cases, where business is especially tough, there have been
compulsory job losses. Komatsu, which makes earth-moving equipment at
Birtley, Tyne and Wear, cut its permanent staff by 80 last year. In an
effort to reduce the number of outright redundancies it seconded some staff
to the local college of technology.
Compulsory redundancies are a delicate matter for Japanese companies.
Brother, a maker of office equipment and microwave ovens in Wrexham, north
Wales, made staff redundant last year but refuses to discuss the matter in
public. Others spoke only on condition that neither they nor their products
were identified. Most of the companies were small and, typically, fewer than
10 people lost their jobs.
The news is not all gloomy. Carmaker Nissan is recruiting 1,600 extra staff
in Washington, Tyne and Wear. The company said: 'We're working a lot of
overtime to satisfy orders mainly for export.' Honda UK is recruiting to
make en-gines for the new Honda Con-certo in Swindon, Wiltshire.
Booming car production has helped parts suppliers. Ikeda Hoover Trim of
Sunderland makes vehicle seats for Nissan. It added more than 100 staff last
year, taking the total employed above 500. Yuasa Batteries of Ebbw Vale,
south Wales, which makes industrial batteries, said that although its rate
of growth had slowed, staffing had risen from 470 to 516 in six months.
Sony was one of the first Japanese companies to start manufacturing in the
UK, in June 1974. It said last year it was spending Pounds 147m to build a
second television plant and research and development centre in Bridgend,
south Wales, employing 1,400.
SP Tyres of Birmingham and Washington, Tyne and Wear, which is owned by
Sumitomo Industries, has held staffing levels. SP's Mr Bob Harwood said: 'We
concentrate on quality, employee involvement and reducing the numbers of
layers of management. There's nothing magical about it.'
