A state-of-the-art energy conservation facility that includes a "house of the 
future" opened in Irwindale to favorable reviews Monday from public officials, 
environmentalists and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
But while the gadgets and gizmos meant to demonstrate energy-saving techniques 
might once have seemed futuristic or startlingly Space Age, today they are 
familiar: 
</P>
<P>
In a room oriented toward conservation applications for businesses, there was 
an industrial-size microwave oven for short-order processing of products from 
pickles to dog food. Parked in a driveway was a white electric-powered van with 
its batteries on display. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, an electric commercial kitchen oven turned out pizzas in five minutes 
-- two-thirds the usual cooking time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. It cooks real fast, and the food tastes no different," said 
Alfonso Martinez, a chef on loan from a nearby pizza restaurant, as the smell 
of baking dough filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
On display in yet another room were light bulbs that last 10 times longer than 
conventional ones -- and cost from $12 to $16 each. However, officials said the 
bulbs more than pay for themselves in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
The $4-million facility's purpose was summed up by Southern California Edison 
Co. Chairman Howard P. Allen, who said, "Here customers can learn firsthand how 
to conserve energy and reduce energy costs without sacrificing comfort or 
convenience or healthful air quality." 
</P>
<P>
Another official described the 23,000-square-foot building as "the largest and 
best equipped facility of its kind in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
He received no argument from a host of public officials, scientists and 
environmental experts, such as Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense 
Council and Art Rosenfeld, a UC Berkeley physicist. 
</P>
<P>
Yet internationally known environmental futurist Armory Lovins, who attended 
the unveiling of the facility, pointed out that the United States lags behind 
such nations as Japan in conservation measures. Japan, he said, "uses 50% less 
energy than America to produce $1 worth of product, and that gap is widening." 
</P>
<P>
"This facility helps do something about that. It's full of reasons for optimism 
that we can do much better," Lovins said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison created the facility after prodding by environmentalists and state 
Public Utilities Commission members who are concerned that California is 
back-sliding in the area of energy conservation. Allen acknowledged that the 
pressure was part of the reason Edison built it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have all the answers," Allen said. "This is an everybody-wins 
facility. We're committed to helping the officials in this area improve the air 
quality which is a major problem for the people of this basin." 
</P>
<P>
Edison invited a host of business, environmental, press and governmental guests 
to the facility's unveiling. Members of the general public may sign up for 
group tours, but the facility is geared primarily to Edison's commercial 
customers, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen noted that the facility has an industrial room where special furniture 
manufacturing ovens are on display. Because the energy-saving ovens use 
ultraviolet light, they can dry high-tech wood finishes without giving off the 
pollutants engendered by the usual varnishing process. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's furniture industry, cited as a culprit in air pollution, 
is struggling to meet strict air quality rules. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said many of the new appliances on display are expensive -- but worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're saying is there is a different and better way," said Edison 
research manager Geoff R. Bales as he stood before a bank of energy-efficient 
light bulbs. "These are state of the art, and we believe they are being 
underutilized. It will cost a little more, but it will pay for itself."
