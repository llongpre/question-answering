EVEN IF you have not had the unique pleasure of eating in the Walnut Tree
Inn at Llandewi Skirrid, near Abergavenny in south Wales, there is a strong
probability that you will have eaten one of Franco Taruschio's dishes. Most
likely, it will have been another chef's variation on Taruschio's bresoala -
thin slices of marinated beef served with olive oil - the recipe which
Taruschio has been passing on to other professional chefs for years.
Now, with his wife, Ann, he has published a delightful book, Leaves from The
Walnut Tree, Recipes of a Lifetime, (Pavilion, Pounds 15.99, 256 pages). It
is full of the more usual culinary details but, as befits a man who is
surely the most modest and unassuming chef in Britain, many of the recipes
are put in their particular context. For the bresoala, we have to thank the
owner of the Piperno restaurant in the Jewish quarter of Rome; for the
Ukrainian ravioli, three Ukrainian students who came to work as plongeurs in
the restaurant kitchens; and, for Thai mussels, a Thai chef who visited the
Walnut Tree for a weekend.
My only disappointment is that the book does not put Taruschio in context.
All we are told is that he came from the Marche region of Italy - a poor
area where the people are known as magna pulentoni, big polenta eaters - to
Rugby, in Warwickshire, via a hotel school in Como, north Italy. He fell in
love with Ann and, 30 years ago, they fell in love with a pub: the Walnut
Tree.
But this lack of detail, although disappointing, only underlines the
Taruschios' varied achievements. The first comes via their respect for raw
ingredients. What is unique is the manner in which they have so patiently
raised standards and encouraged new suppliers across Wales, starting from a
very low level 30 years ago.
With the exception of oils and truffles, which come via Franco's extended
family in Italy, The Walnut Tree offers the exciting opportunity to all its
customers of eating the finest Welsh produce transformed into wonderful
Italian cuisine.
Two specific elements in this transformation reflect Franco's particular
approach to cooking. The first is the importance he attaches to strong
flavours. This does not mean overpowering or contradictory flavours on one
plate but an emphasis on what appear to be simple dishes cooked so that they
taste exactly as they should. His recipes for aubergines in carrozza,
pheasant with olives, the much-maligned - but when it is cooked properly -
grilled scampi and zucchini chips exemplify this philosophy. The book's
precise layout with ingredients listed on the side of the page makes this
approach easy to follow.
What is less obvious, but becomes apparent with several other recipes, is
the gentleness, care and patience with which everything has to be handled to
produce these flavours. The same avuncular concern Franco has shown to so
many chefs in this country he also retains for the humble zucchini flower.
Stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan, dipped in batter and deep
fried in light olive oil these are magnificent - but require great care when
twisting the flower petals. So, too, does Taruschio's recipe for olive
ascolane, large green olives stuffed with a mixture of chicken, veal, Parma
ham, nutmeg and cinammon, a recipe which destroys the aphorism that life is
too short to stuff a mushroom.
Leaves from The Walnut Tree will inspire you in the kitchen. It will also
take you along the winding road which leads out of Abergavenny and,
magically, thanks to the Taruschios, to spend a few hours in Italy.
