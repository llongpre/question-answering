   Actor Gordon Jump once portrayed a radio
station manager with little or nothing to do. Today, as Maytag's
new ``Ol' Lonely'' repairman, Jump's role won't change much.
   But he did have something to do Friday as Maytag Co. officials
marked a milestone at Plant No. 2 in Newton, which celebrated its
40th anniversary.
   Jump, best known for his portrayal of the bumbling Arthur
Carlson in the old sitcom, ``WKRP in Cincinnati,'' was decked out
in the blue-and-white Maytag repairman uniform as he addressed
workers at the plant.
   ``I have a Maytag washer and dryer in our home. I could not be
more proud to represent any product or group of people,'' Jump said.
   Jump, 56, replaced actor Jess White in March as the Maytag
Lonely Repairman, ending White's more than two decades in the job.
   ``This job was done so successfully for so many years by Jess. I
have the opportunity to take that role and do as good a job or
better without treading on the feet of someone who was here for 22
years,'' Jump said.
   The character of a lonely repairman was devised by Maytag to
promote a product the company said was so dependable the service
department rarely was called.
   Since Plant No. 2 started production, its workforce has swelled
from about 450 employees to some 2,500 who have produced about 42
million automatic washing machines and other appliances, said
Maytag spokesman Ron Krajnovich. Maytag, one of the units of the
more than $3 billion Maytag Corp., also employs another 1,000
people in another Newton location.
   At a noontime ceremony at the plant, company President Leonard
Hadley congratulated workers and also recognized 56 workers who
have each put in 40 years of service at the facility.
   After the brief ceremony, several workers asked Jump to
autograph the bills of their hats. They also presented him with a
scrapbook of advice and encouragement entitled, ``Loneliness
Lifeline: a Misery Manual for Dejection Protection _ from the
people who write the book on dependability.''
