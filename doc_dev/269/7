Microwave Oven Settlement Proposed: Thousands of people who bought Magic Chef 
microwave ovens, thinking they were new, would collect $35 each under a 
proposed settlement of three lawsuits against the manufacturer. 
</P>

Since January, 1987, Maytag Corp.'s Anniston plant repackaged or reconditioned 
ovens that customers had returned and sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160. 
Maytag denied any liability in the settlement proposal but agreed to halt the 
practice and offer refunds to the 45,000 to 50,000 customers nationwide who 
bought the ovens. Maytag also agreed to pay up to $300,000 total to the parties 
filing the suits: the Alabama Attorney General's Office and a Birmingham law 
firm.
