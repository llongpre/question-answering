   The recipe was part of a Sumerian hymn to
the goddess Ninkasi, written in cuneiform on a clay tablet that
dates back to 1800 B.C. It calls for ingredients you might not
think of, but it makes a smooth, mild beer _with a little fruity
taste.
   ``It's very good,'' Professor Solomon Katz of the University of
Pennsylvania said as he opened a bottle. ``They used dates to make
it taste that way.''
   The bottle's label had cuneiform characters calling Ninkasi, the
goddess of beer, ``the lady who fills the vessel with beer.'' The
label also showed one of the earliest known tablets, showing two
men using straws to sip beer from a narrow-necked jar.
   The beer was the culmination of two years of research by Katz
and Fritz Maytag, owner of San Francisco-based Anchor Brewing Co.
   They sampled some of the last bottles of the beer last week in
Philadelphia. They had brewed about 100 barrels in August, but said
they were forced to use it up quickly since it contained no
preservatives.
   ``The Sumerians didn't use hops, which help to keep beer from
going sour,'' Maytag said in a telephone interview from San
Francisco.
   Modern beer makers usually use malted, or sprouted, grain, but
the Sumerians used baked bread, which adds to the mild taste, Katz
said.
   ``They did that because the bread was almost magical to them,''
Katz said. ``You could eat it for dinner or you could brew with
it.''
   The cuneiform tablet, originally translated in 1964, records a
brewing process interspersed with praises to the goddess.
   ``You are the one who soaks the malt in a jar, the waves rise,
the waves fall,'' starts one verse.
   ``That's a brewing process,'' Katz said. ``That's exactly what
brewers do today to turn the grains into malt.''
   ``Real brewing is very simple,'' Maytag said. ``And we know that
the brewers 5,000 years ago were extremely skilled. We ought to
assume that these guys were just as good at brewing as we are.''
   By the time the Ninkasi hymn was written, brewing was at least
5,000 years old, said Katz. By 2000 B.C., Sumerian had 55 words
describing different varieties of beer.
   ``Beer recipes are the oldest we have,'' Katz said.
   Katz, an anthropologist specializing in nutrition, believes beer
may be the cornerstone of civilization and has argued that ancient
man turned from hunting to farming to raise grain for beer.
   Barley and wheat _ the two main ingredients of ancient beer _
were among the first grains man began to harvest.
   ``Why did people go out and domesticate a cereal grain that
doesn't have much nutrition?'' Katz asked. ``They had plenty of
other resources ... why would they go through the effort? Could it
be because it was a source of fermented sugar?''
   A 1987 newspaper story about Katz's theories, which the
professor also had written about, caught Maytag's eye and led to
the collaboration.
   ``I thought it was intriguing,'' Maytag said. ``It occurred to
me we should try to make some of the beer, to see what we could
learn.''
   Katz had to pore over many tablets to determine some of the
finer points of the recipe.
   He pointed at the translation of the Ninkasi hymn.
   ``See where it says, `Mixing ... with sweet aromatics?' We can't
be sure if that meant grapes, raisins or dates,'' he said. They
narrowed it down to dates using other recipe tablets from that time
period.
   Maytag has no plans to market Ninkasi, although people have
tried to buy it: ``I don't think the world is ready to buy Sumerian
beer.''
