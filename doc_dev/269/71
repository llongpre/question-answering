   CHEFS ARE notoriously fussy about their equipment

their ovens in particular. Bruno Loubet, the acclaimed chef de cuisine of
the Michelin-starred Four Seasons restaurant in London's Inn on the Park
hotel, is no exception.
When I first met him, several years ago, he told me that one of his
ambitions was to own a Molteni oven. Molteni is the Rolls-Royce of ovens,
with 15 out of 19 three-star chefs in France possessing one. In Britain they
are favoured by Raymond Blanc at the Manoir aux Quat' Saisons and top hotels
such as Grosvenor House. Bruno has had his in place for a couple of years
now and he swears by it.
All the more remarkable, then, that Bruno should be so keen to try out a
quite different piece of kitchen equipment: three perfectly preserved, 19th
century baker's ovens which are still in their original position, behind the
Cinnamon Bakery in Cross Street, Islington, north London. The ovens are in
perfect order, and are still used every night to bake the bread served in
the shop. In the 1930s someone had them gas-fired, but apart from this they
are as perfect as you are likely to find.
The baker's oven used to perform a role in society. Until our own century
most poor households had no oven and dishes requiring baking were taken to
the baker's shop to be cooked there. In Gascony, where Bruno's family
originates, the women took their baking to the village oven on their way to
the village lavoir. While they washed the family linen, dinner was cooking
in the communal oven. This method of cooking gave rise to the culinary
description a la boulangere, dishes particularly well suited to slow cooking
and requiring no precise timing. In general they involve fish or meat with
potatoes and onions.
'It's a method of cooking that is as valid as any other,' says Bruno, who
also praised the Aga cooker. 'It is amazingly beautiful and very clever. You
can cook well on it if you organise yourself.' The real oven snobs are
pastry chefs who refuse to work unless they have an ultra-modern batterie de
cuisine: 'Cooking is about talent, and not about fancy equipment,' he says.
Bruno brought three dishes with him to the Cinnamon Bakery: a shoulder of
lamb a la boulangere (see accompanying recipe); a clotted cream tarte with
hazelnuts, the cream flavoured with honey, lemon peel and bound with butter
and an egg yolk; and prune and walnut bread. Bruno had prepared the dishes
earlier; all they had to do was cook in the old baker's oven.
The base of the ovens is clay, which is ideal for giving flavour to bread.
Bruno thought they could be used for just about anything which did not emit
a strongly scented steam, hence the pastry lute on his lamb shoulder stew.
Bruno thought the stew wonderfully well-suited to Britain: 'This is not the
climate for the Mediterranean diet; on a chilly day you want something hot
and substantial.'
The contents of Bruno's cocotte proved just that, and although it was only
5pm when we took it out of the oven, we all dug in with glee. The fresh
bread was particularly good. We were also delighted with the tarte with its
delicate sweet pastry. Which goes to show that great chefs, like great
people in general, are open minded; and if a pastry chef tells you anything
to the contrary, tell him to get lost.
LAMB SHOULDER A LA BOULANGERE (Serves four)
Ingredients: 2lb lean lamb's shoulder; 400g trimmed leeks; 600g peeled
potatoes or even 500g peeled chestnuts; 3 cloves peeled garlic; 1 bunch of
thyme; 1 bay leaf; 2 dls white wines; 1 tbs chopped parsley; salt and
pepper; 200g flour.
Cut the lamb into 4 cm cubes. Slice the potatoes and the leeks. Crush the
garlic and chop the parsley finely. Place all the ingredients in a cast iron
cocotte and cover with  1/2 litre of water or chicken stock. Season. Retain
flour and parsley. Mix the flour with water until sticky. Lute the lid of
the cocotte with the paste and bake in an oven gas mark 5 for 2 hours.
To serve: Cut the crust around the lid, open it and sprinkle the meat with
chopped parsley. Replace lid. Bring the dish to the table and serve with a
green salad.
