MAYTAG, the US household appliance group, yesterday said deteriorating
business in Europe offset improved North American sales and resulted in a
slightly lower operating net for its second quarter, Reuter reports.
The group reported a net profit of Dollars 23.3m, or 22 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 18.8m, or 18 cents, after a charge of Dollars 10m, or
6 cents for a plant closure.
Maytag said results were slightly lower when compared with year-ago net
before the charge. Sales edged down to Dollars 770m from Dollars 778m a year
ago.
The company's North American appliance group had sales of Dollars 567.4m,
against Dollars 566.8m a year ago. But operating income of Dollars 46.3m was
off 10 per cent because of start-up costs for a new dishwasher plant and
several new electric range models, and the cost of discontinuing operations
at its previous dishwasher facility.
