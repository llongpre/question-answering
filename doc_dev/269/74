   As rumors swirl about an offer for Maytag from either Whirlpool or Black &amp; Decker, one research firm has concluded that Whirlpool presents the appliance industry's best stock value. 

   Several Wall Street arbitragers yesterday expressed doubt that a bid was in the works for Maytag, a Newton, Iowa-based appliance maker. 
And a Maytag spokeswoman said that "to my knowledge" the company hasn't had discussions with any suitor. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Maytag closed at 24 1/2, down 1/4, after gaining 2 3/8 Tuesday. 

   But in a report just released to clients, Zimbalist Smith, a Greenwich, Conn., adviser to institutions, strongly recommends Whirlpool stock. 
"In conjunction with a steady earnings record over the past five years and high cash flow, Whirlpool is a candidate for a financial restructuring or merger," asserts Linda Zimbalist Smith, the firm's investment chief. 

   Ms. Smith says she began the study shortly after General Electric's acquisition of Roper, a move that ended a prolonged bidding war with Whirlpool. 
While the conclusion of that battle is likely to have fueled some of this week's speculation, Ms. Smith thinks that the Street may be looking at the wrong player. 

   "We came out of looking at the Roper transaction realizing how undervalued the whole group was, particularly Whirlpool," says Ms. Smith, who prior to starting her own firm worked in First Boston's merger arbitrage department. 

   Ms. Smith creates computer models that value a company on the possibility of a merger, leveraged buy-out, restructuring or leveraged recapitalization (basically an LBO that allows shareholders to continue to hold a stake). 
She concludes that Whirlpool is the only company in the industry that is undervalued in all four criteria compared with the GE-Roper accord. 

   In Big Board trading, Whirlpool shares closed at 24 7/8, off 1/4. 
Ms. Smith estimates the company's merger value at $46 a share. 

   Her recommendation runs counter to some of Wall Street's conventional wisdom. 
Whirlpool shares are hovering near their 52-week low of 20 1/4. 
Moreover, earlier this week, Value Line Investment Survey cut the stock's timeliness rating to a 5, the service's lowest ranking, and trimmed the earnings estimate. 

   This comes on the heels of disappointing first-quarter results for the Benton Harbor, Mich.-based company. 
Increased costs for parts, higher interest expenses and lower profit from Whirlpool's Brazilian affiliates trimmed the company's per-share profit to 48 cents from 81 cents, after an adjustment in 1987 for an accounting change. 

   Martin A. Sankey, who covers the company for First Boston Corp., New York, calls the earnings decline "particularly disappointing in the wake of the increase in unit volume," which gained 7%. 
Mr. Sankey says he is neutral on the stock. 

   One of Whirlpool's biggest challenges in the current year will be to rebuild its recently acquired KitchenAid unit. 
As part of an effort to reposition KitchenAid, the company severed ties with thousands of dealers, then tried to rebuild the network from scratch. 

   The plan, designed to boost KitchenAid's image as a premium-priced product line and to induce dealers to carry all the brand's appliances (instead of only the ranges and dishwashers that had been the company's cornerstone), is taking more than a year to complete, instead of the projected six to nine months, Mr. Sankey contends. 

   He expects KitchenAid to turn profitable before the end of the year, although he sees the unit incurring losses overall for 1988. 
For all of Whirlpool, he has a 1988 earnings projection of $2.80 a share, compared with $2.68 a share in 1987. 

   Meanwhile, the company will start selling appliances under the Roper brand name to the lower end of the price spectrum. 
That label was provided to Whirlpool by GE as part of the settlement in the Roper transaction. 

   A Whirlpool spokeswoman wouldn't comment on speculation that Whirlpool might bid for Maytag, saying it is the company's policy not to comment on rumors. 

   One institutional holder rejects the bid rumor, arguing that the increased leverage would hurt an otherwise strong balance sheet. 
John K. Schneider, a vice president at Wilmington Capital Management, Wilmington, Del., remains optimistic about the company, projecting earnings this year of about $3 a share. 
Wilmington Capital owns about a million shares of Whirlpool. 

   Mr. Schneider says he's encouraged by the company's first-quarter gains in market share, and notes that a price increase passed along to consumers late in the quarter should help margins. 

   As for Ms. Smith's study, Mr. Schneider sees the possibility of the company's being taken over by a European concern. 
"If there's one to be bought out (in the industry), it's Whirlpool," he contends.
