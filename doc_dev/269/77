THE ONLY time a professional chef in Europe is likely to participate in a
cookery course is when he - or she - is famous enough to run one.
From expansive - and expensive - kitchens, Michel Roux discourses on the art
of patisserie at the Waterside Inn, Bray, Berkshire. Not far away, Raymond
Blanc holds forth at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Oxfordshire.
Those with spacious kitchens and rooms have used cookery courses to
stimulate takings in the quieter months and preach their vision of cooking.
At Ballymaloe House in Cork, Ireland, Darina Allen passes on the cooking she
learnt from her mother, Myrtle Allen. At Chateau de Montreuil, in northern
France, top chef Christian Germain runs cookery courses in November,
December, February and March (tel: 21.81.53.04.) Even those top chefs
without their own permanent kitchens have been able to find somewhere to
teach. You could stir fry with Ken Hom in the top hotel kitchens of Hong
Kong; buy fish at the Venice fish market with Marcella Hazan; or eat, drink
and learn with Sacramento wine merchant Darrell Corti in Chianti. The only
two conditions arean interest in food and enough money to afford the cost.
It is this last condition which has precluded most professional cooks from
learning that way. Low wages in the catering trade - at least until you
reach head chef status, when you take on administrative duties as well -
mean that professional chefs have, devised their own method of further
education.
Once chef de partie status - a minimum four years' work experience after a
college course - has been reached, the chef may be introduced into the
stagiere system. The chef will need to be lucky, have an impressive
curriculum vitae, and a concerned and well-connected employer. Knives
packed, the chef will spend an unpaid week, fortnight (or possibly longer)
in one of the Europe's top kitchens.
The stagiere network began in the early 1970s when the kitchens and dishes
of France's leading chefs - Bocuse, Chapel, Verge and Troisgros, among
others - became internationally famous. It started as an informal
arrangement: word of mouth recommendations were good enough and no money was
involved. The chef gained valuable experience and the kitchen got a free
pair of hands.
Such has been the success of this system that demand has far outstripped
supply. Already this year, Shaun Hill, the popular chef at Gidleigh Park in
Devon, has taken six chefs on week-long stages and has received many more
applicants.
He has, in turn, sent members of his own brigade to work with Raymond Blanc,
John Burton-Race at L'Ortolan, in Berkshire, and Andre Jaeger at the
Fischerzunft, in Switzerland, and watched them return full of enthusiasm and
new ideas.
The best chefs today receive hundreds of applications from would-be
stagieres from all over the world. Although the practice of taking on young
chefs via personal recommendation still persists, top restaurants are
beginning to charge handsomely for the privilege of working an unpaid stage.
When I asked Christian Germain if he thought this was against the original
principles of the system, he scoffed. He said the sums in question, rumoured
to vary from Pounds 600 to Pounds 1,000 a person per week, were scant
compensation for the sources of supply, recipes and menu ideas which were so
promptly borrowed but never acknowledged or returned.
The Academy of Culinary Arts based in Brighton, Sussex, planned to run
courses for professionals but failed because of lack of support. This
contrasts markedly with the situation in the US where the increased demand
for professional training has been met by new courses. There are 86
professional programmes and a growing feeling that the culinary world is one
suitable for serious academic study. Boston University now offers a 'master
of liberal arts: culture and cuisine course.'
America has been fortunate in that it has been able to call for funding on
another domestic industry with an interest in training professional cooks.
For the past decade, a number of leading wineries have brought over chefs to
teach and spread the gospel of good food and wine. In 1989, Beringer
vineyards set up a culinary arts centre for professional chefs in the
grounds of its California winery under the renowned Madeleine Kamman.
Each gruelling two-week course takes four chefs from differing standards of
restaurants and puts them through their paces. With more than 300 applicants
for each course, the hardest decision for senior lecturer Tim Hanni is
selecting the chefs (tel: 707-963-7115).
