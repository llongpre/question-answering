Maytag, the US home-appliance company that makes Hoover products, reported a
surge in net income, to Dollars 61m from Dollars 23m, for the three months
to September, on revenues up 10 per cent at Dollars 848.9m, writes Richard
Tomkins in New York. It said it was the company's best third-quarter
performance in five years.
Part of the increase was attributable to a one-time tax benefit of Dollars
20m resulting from prior operating losses and reorganisation costs in
Europe, but Maytag said that even setting this aside, net profits were up 78
per cent.
In North America, the home appliance operations were having an 'outstanding'
year, and in floor care, Hoover was having its best year since joining the
company in 1989.
