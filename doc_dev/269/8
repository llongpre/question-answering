   I was genuinely surprised that in your Jan. 31 page-one
article on Maytag Corp. you do not understand the concept of
multibrand merchandising practiced not only by appliance
makers, but also by auto makers and many other consumer-goods
producers. Perhaps it was this lack of understanding that
caused you to take such a negative approach to the strategy
developed for Maytag's long-term success.
   While some quotes were taken out of context, my statement,
"I think we would have been squeezed out if we had not become
a full-line company," was presented accurately. The Magic
Chef acquisition allowed us to do just that, in addition to
the opportunity to compete in 60% of the marketplace where
Maytag Co. had never had a presence. The intent was never to
have the brands in the Magic Chef family (Magic Chef, Admiral
and Norge) compete in the same market niche as the Maytag and
Jenn-Air brands.

   Not only were the alleged quality problems blown out of
proportion, it was incorrectly implied that all the
complaints were leveled at the Maytag brand. With the
examples used at the beginning of the article, you contradict
yourself by the use of the quote from Consumer Reports
stating, "A bit of the Maytag charm seems to have rubbed off
on the brands new to the Maytag family."
   Maytag is not the same as it was 10 years ago, when it was
a single company making washers, dryers and dishwashers.
Today, there are two Maytags -- the operating division,
Maytag Co., and the parent, Maytag Corp., consisting of nine
companies, dozens of products and 25 manufacturing operations
in seven countries.
   In the consolidation of the appliance industry in the past
decade, Maytag is a survivor -- as a company and not just as
a brand. However, major organizational change does not come
without problems. The growth we have experienced, which we
acknowledge has presented some short-term difficulties, is
part of a positive strategy.
