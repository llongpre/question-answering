   Maytag Corp. said it expects to report lower first-quarter earnings and flat sales, compared with year-earlier net income of $41.2 million, or 49 cents a share, on sales of $478.9 million. 
The company declined to elaborate. 

   The Newton, Iowa-based appliance maker attributed the estimated drop in earnings to price pressures from part suppliers, lower volume and costs involved in changing its Admiral division's distribution system. 

   Maytag said the softening of sales wasn't a surprise because after four consecutive record years, the appliance industry's growth cycle is "mature." 

   Maytag said that although its 1988 sales may not surpass the record $1.9 billion in 1987, sales will still be very good and should "out-perform the industry."
