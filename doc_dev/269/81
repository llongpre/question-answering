<LEADPARA>  APPRENTICE CHEF Duane Bartlett has found his road to success in the kitchens
of the Fremont Hilton. A native of Sacramento, Bartlett was inspired to be
chef after spending a year working part time in several restaurants. He began
his culinary journey when, at the age of 17, he dropped out of high school to
become a chef. "After two years of thinking that I could work myself up to
chef's status, I found out that it takes a lot more than just hard work alone.
I realized that I needed a culinary education," Bartlett said.;   The first
cooking school Bartlett attended was at a Job Corps Center in Sacramento.
Recognizing his potential, his instructors nominated him as one of the 100 Job
Corps students chosen from 104 centers throughout the country to attend the
National Maritime Union Job Corps Training Center Advanced Culinary Arts
Program on Treasure Island.  </LEADPARA>

BARTLETT HOPES TO BECOME CHEF  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Living in old military barracks with 100 other men and women ages 18-22,
Bartlett studied with some of the finest chefs that the Maritime Union has to
offer. "Most of the chef instructors have over 20 years of experience cooking
on American cruise lines or cargo freighters," Bartlett said. "Our baking
instructor, Chef Floyd Colter, was Gen. Patton's personal chef.";   The
program, which is funded by the government, provides the students with room,
board and training plus a stipend of $100 a month to pay for essentials.
Bartlett graduated in eight months.;   During his studies there, Bartlett
impressed Chef Larry Campbell, a German- and French-trained master ice carver,
with his skill and drive to succeed. Upon his graduation, Bartlett was chosen
by Campbell to spend six years as chef's apprentice to Eric Olsen, the Newark
Hilton's executive chef.;   Now 22, Bartlett has been working under Olsen's
tutelage for 1 1/2 years. Bartlett is learning the chef's methods for
overcoming the challenges in a large restaurant kitchen. "I am studying while
on the job," Bartlett said. "I have cooked breakfast, lunch and dinner. I have
worked as both a night and day pantry chef making all the cold dishes such as
salads, cold sandwiches, fruit plates and hors d'oeuvres. I have also done
brunch cooking, buffet and banquet cooking.";   Bartlett also spends several
hours a week as a student in the San Mateo Chef's Apprenticeship Program.
Chosen as one of 20 talented apprentices by the California Chef's Association
of the Pacific Coast to participate in the program, Bartlett will further hone
his skills in this three-year curriculum.;   Here are a couple of his favorite
recipes:; CHEF'S CHOCOLATE; SOUFFLE;  serves 6; 14 eggs separated; 1 cup heavy
cream; 8 ounces Belgian dark chocolate, chopped; 3/4 cup Grand Marnier; 1 cup
sugar; 4 ounces clarified butter;  To clarify butter: Heat the butter gently
over low flame until it melts completely. Cook until white fat solids are
separated and floating on top of clear liquids. Skim off fat solids. Clarified
butter will keep at room temperature for months because it won't get rancid.; 
 Grease 6 individual ceramic souffle cups with clarified butter. Mix sugar and
eggs in a medium bowl with a wire balloon whisk until sugar dissolves
completely. Combine cream, chocolate and Grand Marnier in medium sauce pan
over medium heat. Heat until chocolate is melted and a smooth consistency is
achieved. While cream mixture is melting, whip egg whites with a large balloon
whisk in a large clean, grease-free bowl. Whip until stiff peaks are formed.
Temper the egg yolks by slowly pouring the chocolate/cream mixture into the
yolks while constantly stirring. This prevents the egg yolks from becoming
scrambled. Pour mixture back into chocolate sauce pan and heat over low heat,
constantly stirring with a wire whisk until a thick pudding forms. Be careful
not to burn the bottom of the pan by constantly scraping it with the whisk.
Take the pudding off the heat and let it cool to about 70 degrees F. Use a
food thermometer if in doubt. Put the cooled pudding into a large clean bowl.
Fold whipped egg whites into pudding mixture one-third at a time. Using a
spatula, put souffle mixture into individual souffle cups. Bake in a preheated
350 degree oven for approximately 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Check
to make sure center is cooked by inserting a toothpick into the middle of one
of the souffles. The toothpick should be dry. Take the souffles out of oven,
dust them with powdered sugar and serve immediately with white chocolate
raspberry sauce on the side in a separate ramekins.; WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY
SAUCE;  Make sauce while souffle is in oven.; 1 cup cream; 1 cup Swiss white
chocolate, chopped; 1 small basket fresh raspberries, approximately 1 cup;  In
a small saucepan over low heat bring cream to the boiling point. Add
raspberries and chocolate. Cook 1 minute until chocolate is melted. Remove
from heat and serve fresh.; MARINATED SKEWERED CHICKEN; 2 lbs. boned chicken
breast cut into thin strips and threaded onto bamboo skewers;  Marinade:; 1/4
cup canola oil; 1 bunch fresh cilantro; 1 medium yellow onion, chopped; 4 oz.
garlic, pressed; 4 oz. crushed chilies; 4 oz. freshly ground black pepper; 
Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl. Arrange the skewered
chicken pieces in a glass 9-inch by 13-inch pan. Pour the marinade over the
chicken, rotating the skewers so it coats the meat. Cover with plastic wrap
and let rest in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Grill over medium hot coals
until pieces turn opaque, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Serve immediately.  </TEXT>
