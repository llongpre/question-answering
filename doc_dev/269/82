   Maytag Corp. said its board approved a new stockholders' rights plan involving the distribution of one preferred-share purchase right for each common share held. 

   Maytag said the plan provides added protection against what it called abusive takeover tactics such as partial tender offers. 
A company spokesman had no comment on whether the new plan is in response to recent takeover speculation regarding Maytag. 

   The appliance maker said the new rights contain provisions that permit a bidder to call for a stockholders meeting to vote to redeem the rights upon compliance with certain procedures when a fair cash offer is made for the company's shares. 

   The new plan also lowers to 20% from 50% the percentage ownership threshold that activates the rights. 

   The new rights expire May 2, 1998. 

   The company also said its board has authorized the redemption of existing rights which were established in August 1986. 
Maytag said right holders of record May 13 will receive the 2.5 cent redemption payment for each one-half right attached to Maytag common shares. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Maytag closed at $23.50 a share, up 12.5 cents.
