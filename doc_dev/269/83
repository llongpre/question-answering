   Two French-cooking schools _ one the oldest, the
other the newest _ are giving the world's gastronomic capital yet
another culinary lift.
   Cordon Bleu, the oldest and most prestigious, has taken on a
high-tech image at a new location in a five-story building that
once was an infirmary.
   The luxurious Ritz Hotel, the newest, is opening its kitchens
April 5 to students of haute cuisine.
   The cachet of the elegant Right Bank hotel is maintained in the
decor of its new basement cooking school, where gleaming
white-tiled spaces and hand-painted murals set the tone.
   The Cordon Bleu, long situated in cramped quarters in the classy
Champ de Mars district under the Eiffel Tower, moved in January to
the building on an anonymous corner of the 15th arrondissement in
southern Paris.
   The school where servants from affluent families long ago
watched cooking demonstrations in an amphitheater now offers every
high-tech amenity, including video screens.
   Both schools offer all levels of instruction up to professional.
   Despite the new home, tradition at the venerable Cordon Bleu
remains intact. The top diploma at the Cordon Bleu is awarded to
students who pass a nine-month session. The Ritz school's top
diploma follows a 12-week course.
   Hardly a newcomer to fine food, the Ritz has been known for its
cuisine since Auguste Escoffier attracted international gastronomes
early in the century. It decided to spread its know-how as part of
an overall renovation plan started by Mohammed Al-Fayed, the
Egyptian entrepreneur who bought the hotel nine years ago.
   ``We feel we're offering unique and superior instruction for a
private cooking school,'' said Gregory Usher, an American who left
the Cordon Bleu to take over the Ritz school's administration.
``Our chefs are tops.''
   The courses are to be supervised by three of the Ritz's own
chefs, all winners of the top professional award, Meilleur Ouvrier
de France. Most daily courses will be handled by two chefs with
credentials from prestigious French restaurants. One, Andre
Guillut, perfected his English while working at restaurants like
l'Orangerie and Ma Cuisine in Los Angeles.
   The up-to-date equipment includes permanently cooled pastry
marbles, the latest in ovens, freezers and mixers. The hotel's meat
smoker will be used for ``charcuterie'' courses, and video outlets
are available for taping recipes.
   Pupils can browse in a reference library, taste wine with the
Ritz's sommelier, and the change and shower after the course in a
special area.
   Across the Seine at Cordon Bleu, in the business since 1896,
it's a whole new world.
   Spanking clean in light greys and blues, today's big-scale
school includes two demonstration rooms, four huge cooking and
pastry rooms, and a beautiful winter garden.
   Equipment includes convection ovens, pastry-rising ovens and
huge dough-kneaders, plus special machines for a new course on
vacuum-packing and cooking _ to be taught by Patrick Martin, the
1987 winner of the French National Cuisine and Pastry trophy.
   ``We're still emphasizing traditional French cuisine,'' said
Robin Cahill, a Cordon Bleu graduate and its spokeswoman. ``But in
our expanded facilities just about everything is new.''
   ``The basics are still the main point,'' said Chef Martin, one
of seven chefs. ``The students will still learn how to chop, knead,
whip and do everything else by hand as well.''
   The overwhelming majority of Cordon Bleu students are from
abroad _ about 30 percent American and 20 percent Japanese, said
Ms. Cahill.
   While the Ritz plans English translations in all courses, the
Cordon Bleu still teaches its advanced courses in French.
   Financing for the modernization comes from the Pages group,
headed by Andre Cointreau, which bought the school in 1981.
   Intermediate students at the Ritz may choose a one-to-six week
course of practical sessions and demonstrations at cost in French
francs of about $800 a week. The Ritz's highest-level Auguste
Escoffier course, a 12-week session, costs about $10,000.
   Cordon Bleu's main three 12-week courses comprise a cycle of
``basic'' through ``superior'' at a cost of about $4,200 each.
   To get the coveted Cordon Bleu Grand Diplome, pupils now spend
nine months, reduced from 12, in intensive cooking and pastry
courses preparing for the big exam, at a cost of $19,000.
   ``We're also offering new intensive four-day practical and
demonstration sessions,'' ranging from charcuterie to regional
cuisine and costing about $500, said Ms. Cahill.
   Both schools conduct wine tasting courses.
   A visitor to Paris who wants to compare the big-school ambience
of the Cordon Bleu with the tonier Ritz can attend demonstrations
at either one for less than $35 each.
