<TEXT>     "During the Depression, my father's father owned a restaurant in Oakland
called The Perkalator in the Fruitdale section. When times were really tough,
they turned it into a soup kitchen because nobody at the time could afford
anything.";    Linda's father and mother also were both professional cooks.;  
 "My father was a broiler cook who used to work at a place called Willy
Dilly's in Hayward," Linda said. "My mother spent many years as a breakfast
cook at Dean's cafe in Pleasanton before she died. Any place my parents
worked, they had a great influence on the management and the clientele.
Business always thrived where they cooked. Both of them were such good people
as well as good cooks that they rarely took vacations. They recognized that
the businesses they worked for relied upon them for their success.";    "I
never thought I would wind up in this business," admitted Linda, the pastry
chef of the Blackhawk Grille in Danville. "I didn't want the type of schedule
that my parents kept, working 7 days a week and on holidays. I have come to
realize that, in my case, my occupation picked me. I had an overwhelming
desire to cook whether it was in my own kitchen or in a professional kitchen.;
   "I began to realize that I only knew how to make American 'down home' style
food like fried chicken and chicken fried steak, so I began subscribing to Bon
Appetit magazine," Linda said. "That inspired me to start studying French
cookbooks, and finally I decided I needed more direction. I saved all of my
waitressing tips in order to go to school.";    After a 28-week course of
cooking at the Judith Ets Hokin Cooking School in San Francisco, Linda
enrolled in the California Culinary Academy and graduated in 1988.;    Now, as
the pastry chef for the Blackhawk Grille, Linda tempts patrons with her
enticing confections. When the pastry cart appears, diners might choose from
her citrus cheesecake, linzer torte, apple and sun-dried cranberry strudel
with pecans, or her hazelnut parfait. You can taste her creations at the
Grille, located on the corner of Camino Tassajara and Crow Canyon Road, in
Danville. The phone number is (415) 736-4295.;    Cheesecake is on the top of
Linda's list of favorite desserts to bake. Here are some professional tips for
foolproof cheesecake:;    (check) Don't overcook. Overcooked cheesecakes get
cracks in the top and have a slightly dried texture.;    (check) To prevent
over-cooking, Linda bakes most of her cheesecakes in a water bath. She
suggests baking cheesecakes in a springform pan. Select a second pan -- larger
than the springform pan and about half as deep -- for holding the water bath.;
   Before filling the springform pan with your recipe, wrap the outside of the
pan in heavy duty aluminum foil so the foil goes all the way up to the edges
of the pan. This will prevent the water from seeping into the cake during
cooking. In a preheated oven, place the larger pan on a middle rack. Place the
aluminum foil-wrapped springform pan, filled with your recipe, in the center
of the larger pan. Gently pour approximately 1-inch of hot tap water
(approximately 160 degrees) into the larger pan to form a water bath. Cook
your cheesecake according to the time designated in your recipe.;    (check)
When baking cheesecake made with more sour cream than cream cheese, be careful
not to overcook.;    (check) To get your cheesecake to rise higher, thoroughly
butter the sides of the spring form pan as well as the bottom.;     LINDA'S
SINFULLY RICH; CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE;    This is one of the few cheesecake
recipes that Linda does not bake in a water bath. After taking notes for this
make-ahead recipe, I was inspired to try it out as the dessert course for my
in-laws' 40th wedding anniversary dinner party. Needless to say, it was a
tremendous hit. Just remember that a little of this cake goes a long way. One
9- to 10-inch in diameter cake will serve 8-10 people easily.;  Crust; 1
tablespoon butter, room temperature;  1/3 cup melted butter;  1 package
chocolate; wafers (8 1/2 ounces);   pinch of salt;   pinch of cinnamon;  Using
the tablespoon of butter, thoroughly butter a 9 or 10-inch springform pan. In
the work bowl of your food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade,
process the wafers until finely ground. Add the remaining ingredients and
process until mixed. Pat the mixture into the bottom of the buttered
springform pan. Refrigerate while making the rest of the cheesecake.;    
Filling;  1 1/2 lbs. softened cream cheese;  1 cup sugar;  3 Tbsps. Hershey's
cocoa; powder;  1 lb. bittersweet chocolate, broken into small pieces;   pinch
of salt;  4 eggs;  3/4 cup sour-cream;  2 Tbsps. softened unsalted butter;  1
tsp. vanilla;  To melt chocolate: Place the chocolate in the work bowl of your
food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until finely ground.
Transfer the chocolate to a completely dry medium-sized microwave proof bowl
or glass measuring cup. Microwave the chocolate for 30 seconds at 50 percent
power. Stir with a completely dry spatula and place in the microwave for an
additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Continue to stir and microwave at
50 percent power until the chocolate is melted. Set chocolate aside to cool
while preparing the rest of the cake.;    Note: When melting chocolate in the
microwave, remember that it will hold its shape even after melting. Don't be
fooled into thinking that the chocolate is not melted. Continue to stir and
check to prevent burning.;    In the work bowl of your food processor fitted
with the metal chopping blade, place the cream cheese, 1/4 cup of the sugar,
the cocoa and salt. Process until well blended, stopping to scrape the sides
of the bowl with a spatula to incorporate any unmixed ingredients. In a
separate large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat the eggs and remaining sugar
until tripled in volume. Mix the cream cheese mixture, a 1/2 cup at a time,
into the egg mixture. Beat in the cooled melted chocolate on low speed. Add in
the sour cream, then the butter, and then the vanilla. Bake 10 minutes in a
preheated 350-degree oven, reduce the heat to 325 and bake an additional 35-45
minutes. Take the cake out of the oven and cool on a wire rack for several
hours. Chill overnight in refrigerator. Will last in refrigerator for 3-4 days.  </TEXT>
