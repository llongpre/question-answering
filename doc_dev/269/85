FT  31 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Scullery skulduggery - The odd case of the
photocopied recipes

ON THE desk in the busy office of one of London's top chefs sits a pile of
correspondence between the restaurant's solicitors and a Citizen's Advice
Bureau and an envelope containing a week's wages and a P45 awaiting the
return of a young chef.
The restaurant's head chef, who has a quite distinctive style, would be only
too happy to hand these over personally if he could receive in exchange what
he believes is rightly his: the copies of the recipes made without
permission during this particular young chef's four-week apprenticeship.
In many other trades and industries this story could easily appear under the
headings 'industrial espionage' or 'theft of intellectual property' but in
the catering business such phrases cannot be used. Recipes set restaurants
apart and fill tables but it would take supreme arrogance to lay claim to
'an original recipe'. Just by changing small amounts of the basic
ingredients anyone can formulate another 'original recipe'. Often what holds
back young chefs is the lack of a repertoire of proven dishes. One answer
could be to copy them.
So how can you protect your own recipes? Unless, as chef, you are going to
make everything yourself, you have to share your recipes with your staff
and, to maintain their consistency, put them down on paper or on floppy
discs (word processors have been almost as big a boon for the busy head chef
as the food processor for his commis chefs).
As head chef you must accept that you only achieved your exalted position by
working first under a number of other chefs who were prepared to pass their
knowledge on. On the way up you can take advantage of the catering
industry's high turnover of personnel. But once you reach the top this
becomes less of an advantage and more of a hazard.
Chefs around the world try to protect themselves in two ways. The first is
the trust that they show their staff and which they hope is reciprocated. In
a busy kitchen - which may be densely populated from 8am to midnight seven
days a week - it is hard to conceal anything. The names of your suppliers,
your recipes and even your projected gross margins are open secrets.
Equally, it is hard for a spy to find a quiet corner to scribble down the
kitchen's secret formulae.
But if you do manage this once you are unlikely to repeat the success.
Although an impressive curriculum vitae helps secure promotion, it is not as
important as a good reference. In their evaluation of their staff, chefs are
frighteningly honest and always willing to air their opinions.
In this particular case, the head chef checked the applicant's references
with her former employers and put her to work on a four-week trial period on
the basis that, if a permanent position became available, she would stay for
a minimum of a year. There were, initially, the usual difficulties, mainly
to do with the speed of her work and one or two complaints from fellow chefs
that she was spending too much time copying recipes rather than working from
the master recipe file. When she was confronted, the apprentice said she had
just copied basic pastry recipes rather than anything more significant.
The restaurant later deduced that the young chef had managed to copy
approximately 150 of the restaurant's recipes by duping the rest of the
kitchen into thinking she had the head chef's permission. She did this in
the early evening when the proprietor went home between the lunch and dinner
shifts. When the head chef, impressed by the applicant's obvious passion for
bread and pastry, offered her a full time job he was therefore most
surprised to be rebuffed. The apprentice would no longer commit herself for
a year, as she had originally promised she would, and walked out.
The head chef was naturally hurt and saddened by his misplaced trust and
mistaken professional judgment. When, shortly afterwards, he met fellow
chefs including Albert Roux, Rowley Leigh, Simon Hopkinson and Alastair
Little around the lunch table one suggested recourse to lawyers, which has
yielded the return of some recipes, but the others could offer nothing more
concrete.
Even the best kitchens, it seems, have failed to create a recipe that will
replace trust in one's fellow man.
