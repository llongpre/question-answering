   The U.S. dollar's weakness has persuaded Tokyo-based Toshiba Corp. to sell in Japan some microwave ovens and television sets that the company will manufacture in the U.S. 

   Toshiba America Inc.'s Lebanon, Tenn., manufacturing division plans to ship 100,000 microwave ovens and 100,000 TV sets to Japan in the fiscal year beginning April 1, said Robert H. Traeger, vice president and general manager of the division. 
Toshiba America is the U.S. subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. 

   "The dollar-yen situation has shifted," Mr. Traeger said. 
"Now it makes more sense to make products here." 

   The dollar has lost almost half its buying power in yen in less than three years. 
As a consequence, Mr. Traeger said, cost in yen of manufacturing some appliances in the U.S. has fallen below the cost in Japan. 

   The U.S.-made Toshiba appliances will differ in their technical specifications, such as voltage requirements, from those Toshiba makes for the U.S. market, Mr. Traeger said. 

   The shipments to Japan will represent about 20% of the Lebanon plant's current production capacity for TV sets, and 10% of the capacity for microwave ovens, Mr. Traeger said. 
The plant employs 650 people now, he said, but employment may rise to 750 or 800 within a year, partly as a result of the increase in production for export to Japan. 
The plant already exports to Canada and South America. 

   Because of Japan's full-employment policy, Mr. Traeger said, no Toshiba employees will be laid off in Japan. 
But he said some of those who are making microwave ovens and TV sets may be assigned other work. 

   Sony Corp.'s Sony Corp. of America subsidiary already ships some U.S.-made TV picture tubes to Japan. 
A Sony America spokesman at the company's headquarters in Park Ridge, N.J., said some finished TV sets may be exported to Japan, beginning in 1989.
