<LEADPARA>  HOME cooking has definitely changed.;   These days it's rare that anyone
spends four hours over a stove to prepare a single dish. Or starts cooking for
a party three days ahead. Or follows Julia Child recipes for an entire menu.
But, on the other hand, home cooking is more than opening a microwave oven,
sticking in a frozen box and punching the pad.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WRITER ADVISES COOKS TO 'FOLLOW LOOSE APPROACH'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Florence Fabricant wraps it all up in her latest book, "New Home Cooking:
Feeding Family, Feasting Friends" (Clarkson Potter, $30). For more than 20
years she has written about food for the New York Times and the Nation's
Restaurant News.;   Fabricant credits restaurant chefs with bringing about
changes in home kitchens. "Were it not for the explosion of restaurant chefs
and their talents, the idea of today's home cooking would not have come
about," she said recently at a book-signing reception at Meadowood in St.
Helena.;   Her book is good -- and usable. The menus are quick, stylish, easy
(most of the time), informal and allow for spontaneity. "People say my recipes
work," Fabricant says proudly.;   Fabricant finds great pleasure in
entertaining. But she warns against using preconceived menus and recipes.
"Follow a loose approach," she says. Decide on meat or fish, salad or not,
cake or pie. Hold off on ingredients until you get to the market and see
what's in season, what's top quality. Revise the menu accordingly. Fabricant
says she has been known to change an entire menu plan when she found something
new or unusual while shopping.;   Say you've decided to make a sauteed pepper
stir-fry. You get to the market and discover some great baby artichokes or
napa cabbage. The peppers can wait.;   While Fabricant says chefs have
contributed to major changes in the kitchen, she also says most chefs are
unaware how home cooks function. And the more complicated a recipe is, the
more prone it is to error. In her book, she takes ideas and recipes from
professional chefs and translates them into ordinary language.;   Most of
Fabricant's menus reflect classic, homey fare. Occasionally, though, she gets
carried away. Take her "Pasta, Pesto and Pears" menu with its arugula salad
with pesto vinaigrette; penne with eggplant, tomatoes and mozzarella; and
lemon-pepper pears splashed with grappa. Too much, too trendy.;   Her
fall-holiday menu shines, however, with roast turkey breast with sweet mustard
glaze, corn bread and pepper dressing, braised brussels sprouts and
cranberry-pecan pie. The dishes are straightforward and uncomplicated, and
many lend themselves to advance preparation and reheating. With this menu,
Fabricant recommends a fruity red wine such as beaujolais or full-bodied
chardonnay.; (hbox);   This recipe calls for long, slow cooking at very low
temperature to produce a moist, tender turkey breast.; ROAST TURKEY BREAST
WITH SWEET MUSTARD GLAZE; 1 boneless turkey breast, about 3 1/2 to 4 pounds,
rolled and tied; 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened; 1/2 tablespoon
grainy mustard; 1/2 tablespoon light brown sugar; Salt and freshly ground
black pepper;  Heat oven to 200 degrees. Place turkey breast on a rack in a
roasting pan.;   Mix butter with mustard and brown sugar, and rub this mixture
over the exposed surfaces of the turkey breast. Season lightly with salt and
pepper.;   Roast the turkey about 3 hours, until a meat thermometer registers
150 degrees. Remove the turkey from the oven and allow to sit at least 20
minutes before removing the trussing strings and slicing. Makes 8 servings.;

mg. sodium, 159 mg. cholesterol.; (hbox);    This following basic corn bread
recipe can also be used to make muffins. To do so, add 1/4 cup sugar to the
batter.; BASIC BUTTERMILK CORN BREAD; 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal; 1 cup
all-purpose flour; 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 1/2 cups
buttermilk; 1 large egg, beaten; 2 tablespoons corn oil;  Heat oven to 400
degrees. Butter a 9- or 10-inch round baking pan or a cast-iron skillet.;   In
a large bowl, blend the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in
buttermilk, egg and oil. Spread batter in pan, and bake 30 minutes. Makes 6 to
8 servings.;   One serving: 279 calories, 46 gm. carbohydrate, 8 gm. protein,
7 gm. fat, 636 mg. sodium, 38 mg. cholesterol.; (hbox); CORN BREAD AND PEPPER
DRESSING; 2 tablespoons olive oil; 1 1/2 cups chopped onions; 2 cups chopped
red bell pepper; 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper; 1/2 cup chopped scallions;
2 tablespoons minced, seeded, fresh hot green chilies; 5 cups diced, slightly
stale Basic Buttermilk Corn Bread (see previous recipe); 1/3 cup chicken stock
(approximately); Salt and freshly ground black pepper;  Heat oven to 375
degrees. Grease a 6-cup baking dish attractive enough for serving.;   Heat
olive oil in a skillet. Add onions and red and green peppers, and saute over
medium heat until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add scallions and
chilies; cook over low heat for 10 minutes.;   Stir in corn bread, adding
enough stock to moisten the mixture lightly but thoroughly; it should remain a
trifle crumbly and not be soaked. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place
in the baking dish and cover with foil. Bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 15
minutes longer. Makes 6 to 8 servings.;   One serving: 354 calories, 54 gm.

(hbox);   For this next dish, cutting an "X" into the core of each brussels
sprout ensures that it will cook evenly. Take care not to overcook.;   
BRAISED BRUSSELS SPROUTS; 2 pints brussels sprouts; 1 medium onion, minced;
1/4 cup dry white wine; Salt and freshly ground black pepper; 2 tablespoons
Dijon mustard; 1/3 cup heavy cream; 1 teaspoon sugar; 1 tablespoon white wine
vinegar;  Trim the bottoms of the brussels sprouts and cut an "X" into the
core of each. Place them in a saucepan with the onion and wine, cover tightly,
and cook over medium heat about 15 minutes, until sprouts are just tender.
Season them lightly with salt and pepper.;   Mix mustard, cream, sugar and
vinegar in a bowl. Add to brussels sprouts and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until
the cream mixture has thickened somewhat. Serve at once. Makes 8 servings.;  
One serving: 67 calories, 6 gm. carbohydrate, 2 gm. protein, 4 gm. fat, 64 mg.
sodium, 13 mg. cholesterol.; (hbox); CRANBERRY-PECAN PIE; 3 1/2 cups

1 1/2 tablespoons flour; 1/2 cup golden raisins; 1/4 cup fresh orange juice;
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted; Pastry
for one 9-inch crust; 1 1/3  cups sour cream; 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract; 
Heat oven to 400 degrees.;   Coarsely chop berries in a food grinder or food
processor. Transfer to a bowl and add the pecans, 1 cup sugar, and the flour,
raisins, orange juice, cinnamon and melted butter. Mix thoroughly.;   Roll out
pastry and place in a 9-inch pie pan. Spoon in the filling. Bake for 45
minutes, until the crust is brown and the filling begins to bubble. Remove
from the oven and cool for 30 minutes, leaving the oven on.;   Mix the sour
cream with the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and the vanilla. Spread on top of
the pie, return to the oven, and bake 5 minutes to set the topping. Cool
completely before serving. Makes 8 servings.;   One serving: 439 calories, 57
