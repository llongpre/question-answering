FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: White goods war washes over
Europe - The link between Electrolux and AEG's household appliance unit

If Europe's status as the decisive battleground in the global white goods
war has become increasingly apparent over the past five years, yesterday's
deal between Electrolux of Sweden and Germany's AEG Hausgerate simply rubbed
the message home.
By taking a 10 per cent stake in the household appliances unit of AEG, part
of Daimler-Benz, the Swedish multinational is signalling its intention to
defend its leading position in a European white goods market whose
competitive balance is being transformed by takeovers and co-operation
deals.
The structural change is gradually breaking down national boundaries in the
white goods industry, even if producers still have to allow for big
variations in customer preferences. For medium-sized companies such as AEG,
competing long-term will not be easy against larger producers which have
organised production on a European or global basis, leading to lower costs
and increased efficiency.
The two companies plan to co-operate in a restructuring of their respective
production facilities for washing machines, tumble driers and dishwashers -
and are limiting the deal to production and product development. Even so,
both are keen to stress the deal's strategic rationale - to meet the
increasing competition from the US and Japan in the European domestic
appliances market.
This challenge is being spearheaded by Whirlpool of the US, the world's
largest white goods producer, which last year completed the Dollars 1.1bn
takeover of Philips' white goods business. Maytag, another US white goods
producer, bought Hoover in 1989 when it took over Chicago Pacific, while the
Anglo-American joint venture General Domestic Appliances, owned by General
Electric of the US and the UK's General Electric Company, is a leading
participant in the UK market and is looking for expansion opportunities in
continental Europe.
The aim of the US producers, and especially Whirlpool, has been to transfer
the production efficiencies learned in the heavily concentrated US market to
a European market where profitability has been hampered by the industry's
fragmented structure.
This, in turn, has encouraged some of the rationalisation among smaller
European producers, which are realising that it is easier for larger
producers to survive in tough market conditions. Electrolux itself, however,
has been the other main force behind the industry's rationalisation and
adoption of pan-European manufacturing and marketing, starting with the
acquisition of Zanussi of Italy in 1984.
In the background are the Japanese producers, notably Matsushita and
Toshiba, which have avoided splashy acquisitions in the European market but
are being closely watched by European competitors.
So far, Japanese producers have made less impact in the European market for
appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers than in microwave ovens,
which accounted for 13 per cent of European white goods sales last year and
were almost entirely responsible for an increase in the total market to 56m
units, according to Electrolux.
But the Japanese producers' manufacturing efficiency, and the financial
strength that comes from a stranglehold on their home market, makes them
potentially powerful competitors in the European market, and increases the
pressure on indigenous suppliers to produce white goods more quickly and
efficiently.
All these issues underly yesterday's announcement, prompting Mr Ruggero
Bodo, vice-president for planning at Whirlpool International, to comment
that the deal 'confirms that our reading of the dynamics of the business is
the correct one'.
Inevitably, however, there are also some special factors behind the deal,
giving it a strongly German flavour. Electrolux has been keen to expand its
market share in Germany, Europe's largest single market, and last year's
relaunch of its Electrolux brand as an 'upper mass-middle market' product
range was partly aimed at reasonably affluent middle class Germans who might
think twice about buying a premium product such as a Miele or an AEG.
There have been rumours that Electrolux would try to buy AEG, but in
settling for a production and product development deal it is sharing, albeit
only partly, in what Mr Bill Coleman, an analyst at James Capel, calls 'a
good profitable business in Germany, highly-priced and very much a premium
brand . . . AEG is an attractive company in white goods, less so in
electronics.'
Last year the German market in white goods showed continued strength,
although Electrolux says growth dropped considerably in the second half of
the year. Even so, the market is much healthier than its counterparts in the
UK or the Nordic countries. 'Germany is still holding up pretty well,
although we don't see any increases,' said Mr Lennart Ribohn, senior
executive vice-president, this month.
At the European level, Electrolux believes co-operation with AEG will
succeed because the companies have complementary rather than the same
European markets. AEG is strong in Germany and Poland while Electrolux has a
larger presence in Italy, Britain, Spain and the Nordic region.
For AEG, the deal brings economies of scale in white goods manufacturing
without jeopardising the Hausgerate unit's independence.
Foreign white goods producers have been involved in sporadic discussions
with AEG ever since its parent company sought court protection from its
creditors in 1982.
A domestic solution to AEG's need for critical mass seemed to be developing
last autumn when Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, the German market leader, said it
was negotiating a link-up. But that would almost certainly have provoked
objections from Germany's Cartel Office.
There is no chance that the deal will have the same effect. Electrolux has
only 5 per cent of the German market, against AEG's 13 per cent.
The deal will not, as initially structured, change the rankings in the
western European market - Electrolux has about 18 per cent, followed by
Bosch-Siemens with 13 per cent and Whirlpool with 9 per cent.
Observers were wondering yesterday whether the deal was the prelude to a
closer financial link-up or even a full takeover. Electrolux has the option
to raise its stake in AEG Hausgerate to 20 per cent, and Mr Anders Scharp,
the Swedish company's chairman, said the proposed co-operation was the
'first step in a larger co-operative investment especially when it came to
research and development in washing machines and tumble dryers'.
Given AEG's long search to maintain independence for its white goods
business while addressing the wider changes in the industry, a full takeover
looks unlikely.
