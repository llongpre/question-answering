FT  03 APR 93 / New Hoover chief makes cost cutting top priority

THE new head of Hoover said yesterday that his top priority was to cut the
company's operating losses, after admitting that worsening problems in its
free flights promotion scheme had led him to take up the job earlier than
planned.
'My real mission here is to look after the profitability of the business,'
Mr Gerald Kamman, managing director of Hoover UK and president of Hoover
Europe, said. 'We are concerned about the operating profitability of the
company.' Mr Kamman, who arrived in Britain from the US on Monday, said this
concern was the principal reason for his appointment, though his predecessor
would probably not have been dismissed had the free flights scheme not gone
so badly wrong.
One of his first actions had been to summon Hoover's 75 top UK managers and
European sales subsidiaries to a meeting, at which he told them the company
must improve its efficiency.
He planned to review Hoover's management structure and did not know whether
he would replace the company's vice-president of marketing and the director
of marketing services, who also left the company this week.
He had not yet decided how to tackle Hoover's losses, which partly reflected
operating cost problems. He would not say whether the measures to be taken
would include redundancies. Last year Hoover Europe lost Dollars 67.1m,
after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge, on sales of Dollars 501.9m.
Mr Kamman said Maytag, the US domestic appliance manufacturer which owns
Hoover, had brought forward his appointment after it became clear that the
costs of the company's free flights programme far exceeded earlier
estimates. He had not realised the full extent of the difficulties until his
arrival. However, he insisted that the Dollars 30m after-tax charge against
earnings, announced by Maytag on Tuesday, would fully cover the cost of
meeting Hoover's obligations to customers under the programme.
'I'm hopeful that when it's over, we will have a few quid in the bank,' Mr
Kamman said. 'We erred intentionally on the high side when calculating the
cost.'
He declined to say how many purchasers of Hoover products had applied for
free flights or how many applications had been satisfied. 'Some of the
redemption rates are not even known. Some certificates are not due in for
several weeks,' he said.
'We are honourable people and the Hoover name stands for integrity.'
Hoover last night said that its news release about the departure of Mr
Michael Gilbey, director of marketing services, could have been read as
suggesting he was dismissed.
It added: 'In fact, Mr Gilbey was made redundant as a result of a
restructuring of Hoover's marketing departments.'
