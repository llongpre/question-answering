different things, including the wonderful food I tasted as a child.";  
Marital status: Single;   Home: Russian Hill apartment;   Age: 29;  
Relaxation: "I tend to be by myself when I'm not at work, because at work I'm
always with people. If I have a moment of leisure, I go to the movies by
myself." Current favorite: "Europa, Europa.";   Favorite restaurant: Hyde
Street Bistro in San Francisco;   Musical preferences: Jazz and blues singing,
especially Billy Holiday. Also traditional Persian music.;   Proudest moment:
"There have been a lot of small moments that have given me a lot of pride.
Once a chef told me my sauce was 'incredible, better than I could make it.'
When I think about that I still get goose bumps.";   If you could have one
last meal, it would be: A saffron rice dish with lentils, chicken and dates
her grandmother used to make for her.;   Describe yourself: "When I die, I
just want them to say on my grave, 'She was a good cook.' ";   Favorite
