<LEADPARA>  WHETHER it's a warm apple cobbler topped with vanilla ice cream, a satisfying
quince and fig compote or a crunchy cranberry crisp, there is something
soothing about fall fruit desserts.;   Summer fruit produces glossy tarts and
svelte sorbets. Autumn fruit desserts are more rustic as befits cooler weather
and heartier eating.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's the kind of food that really makes me happy," says Jesse Cool,
Mercury News produce columnist. "The world is so confusing and these desserts
bring us back to basics. They're also in tune with the simplicity of
American-style cooking.";   Simplicity is a real key for fall fruit desserts.
No need to worry about less-than-ethereal tart crusts, cakes that don't quite
look the way they do in food magazines or directions that vaguely resemble the
tax code. With fall fruit desserts, you can pretty much throw things together
and -- wham! bam! -- you've got something that will warm even the stoniest of
hearts.;   Here's a guide to many facets of fall fruit desserts.;   Cobblers; 
 Though you can make a cobbler with any kind of fruit, sturdy autumn fruits
are especially appropriate.;   "Summer fruit tends to break down in cobblers
giving you a mushy texture," Cool says, "but fall fruits hold their shape and
texture.";   Cobblers are essentially deep dish pies with sweet pastry or
biscuit crusts. Though they can have bottom crusts, they often don't. And that
makes them all the easier. Crusts can be a single layer of dough or made up of
individual biscuits, even scones. Serve them warm or at room temperature with
ice cream, whipped cream or creme fraiche.;   Compotes;   Generally defined as
cut-up fruit that has been slow-cooked in syrup and spices and chilled, the
compote has a dowdy image. But compotes can be elegant. At The Sherman House
in San Francisco, chef Donia Bijan's seasonal French menu includes cheesecake
topped with a compote of quince poached in Sauternes with vanilla and orange
peel.;   The addition of dried fruit gives compotes a contrast in texture. The
cooking syrup can contain any number of liquids from fruit juices to red
wine.;   And compotes don't have to be cold. They are even more satisfying
served warm or at room temperature with a splash of heavy cream and soft
oatmeal-raisin cookies or date bars. Eliminate the cream and you have a
relatively low-calorie dessert.;   Poached fruit;   A vastly underappreciated
method of preparing fruit desserts.;   "Poached apples or pears are just
wonderful," Bijan says. "Poaching and baking brings out the flavor more in
fall fruits than summer fruits.";   Unlike compotes, poached fruit is usually
served whole. As a result, the fruit, such as Bosc pears, needs to be firm so
it won't break down. Poaching liquid can include fruit juices, white or red
wine, or any number of fortified wines such as port, vermouth or Compari. Or
intensify the fruit flavor with brandies such Pear William or applejack.;  
Seasoning includes cinnamon sticks, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, peppercorns,
vanilla, lemon or orange peel. Instead of granulated or brown sugar for
sweetening, you can use honey, maple syrup, or preserves such as orange
marmalade. The syrup is often reduced and poured over the fruit to give it a
lustrous sheen and added flavor.;   As with compotes, poached fruit is low in
the fat department, especially if you skip that dollop of whipped cream on the
side, and relatively low in calories.;   Crisps;   Also called crumbles,
because their topping has a crumbly, crunchy texture. The topping provides a
marvelous contrast to the sweetness of the fruit. Here's where nuts such as
almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts and pecans work their magic. Often one or more of
these nuts are mixed with oatmeal or similar grains (you can even use a cereal
such as Grape Nuts) for added texture. The topping can also include sharp
cheddar if the crisp contains apples.;   Crisps of individual fruits such as
apples or cranberries are fine. But try combining them as well.;   Bettys;   A
cousin to crisps and crumbles, according to Linda Zimmerman and Peggy Mellody,
authors of "Cobblers, Crumbles and Crisps" (Clarkson Potter, $11), this homey
fruit dessert was originally made of layers of sweetened and spiced apples and
buttered crumbs. Today, bread cubes often replace the crumbs, and any fruit
can be used.;   The bread doesn't have to be plain, old white bread either.
Try raisin bread, nut breads, eggy challah or Italian panettone. A great way
to use up leftovers.;   And you can use leftover fruit as well. Super chef
Jacques Pepin makes a betty with leftover baked apples.;   Baked fruit;   Like
poached fruit, an underutilized method of dessert-making that's perfect for
sturdy fall fruit, especially apples, quince and pears. And as with poached
fruit, it can be low in fat and relatively low in calories.;   Apples make the
best baked fruit because there are so many varieties to choose from and
because they accommodate so many other flavors.;   Dried fruit -- especially
prunes, raisins, dates, apricots and figs -- are wonderful stuffed inside
baked apples. For added flavor, you could soak them in brandy, rum or fruit
juice. Nuts go well in stuffing too. In addition to walnuts, almonds and
hazelnuts, try toasted pine nuts.;   For sweeteners, apricot preserves or
orange marmalade work especially well. Seasonings can include cinnamon,
nutmeg, candied ginger, cardamom and allspice.;   Gratins;   Technically this
is also a baked fruit dessert but it usually involves cut up, rather than
whole fruit. The fruit or fruit mixture is baked in a gratin dish until it
caramelizes in a hot oven or under a broiler. Occasionally, the fruit is first
mixed with a cream sauce such as creme anglaise. A simple combination might be
apples and seedless grapes with apricot preserves or pears with preserved
ginger in syrup.; Pandowdy;   Another variation on deep-dish pie, this was
originally a breakfast dish served on New England farms. (Not a bad idea for
any of these desserts.) Usually made with apples, it has the same structure as
a cobbler but with one fillip. After it has baked about two-thirds of the way
through, the crust is broken into pieces (called "dowdying"). The pieces are
pushed down into the fruit and the dish returned to the oven for completion.; 
 Try an updated pandowdy of apples, quince and dried cherries seasoned with
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. Spoon into bowls and serve hot or warm
with heavy cream or ice cream.  </TEXT>
