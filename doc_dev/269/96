When I asked Rick Boufford about his extraordinary wine list, he opened up like 
a sunflower in July. 
</P>
<P>
Boufford is the proprietor of Tustin's Black Sheep Bistro, a sweet little 
storefront restaurant that is just full of surprises. Wine is his passion, and 
it shows -- the restaurant is a paradise for wine lovers. If Boufford has a 
great wine to match every dish he serves, it's because he has been collecting 
wines for 18 years, about half his life. 
</P>
<P>
There are wines on his list from nearly every famous producer in Europe. "This 
wine," he said, referring to a '78 Barbaresco from Angelo Gaja that he 
personally decanted at the table, "has been in my cellar at 60 degrees for over 
11 years, since its release." Finding a wine this sought-after in a 
neighborhood restaurant is rare enough, but having it served properly after 
years of impeccable care comes as a shock. Very few restaurants anywhere handle 
wine with half Boufford's seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
He takes cooking seriously, too, as he happens to be the chef. He cooked at the 
Hobbit for 11 years and worked with Alan Greeley at the Golden Truffle, two 
restaurants where a chef can do almost anything that strikes his fancy. The 
style he developed from his tenure at these restaurants could best be described 
as Mediterranean: heavy on garlic, herbs and olive oil. His menu is simple and 
rustic, full of farmhouse dishes from the south of France and the north of 
Italy. Nearly all his food complements wine from Piedmont, Burgundy or one of 
the other great wine regions nearby. 
</P>
<P>
You get the sneaking suspicion that he has opened a restaurant just to create a 
vehicle for wine appreciation. You might be right. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Diana, bought the place last year and retained its cozy, rural 
appeal. There are wooden farmhouse chairs, robin's-egg tablecloths and framed 
scenes depicting life in the slow lane of rural France. The two dining areas 
are separated by a tiled wine bar, the larger (and invariably more crowded) 
room being for nonsmokers. An eclectic blend of New Age and classical music 
plays softly in the background. It's a comforting place to spend an evening. 
</P>
<P>
The minute you are seated, Diana, the unofficial maitre d', brings a dish of 
the restaurant's home-cured olives, the Nicoise variety. They come swimming in 
a marinade thick with thyme, oregano and minced garlic, and are dangerously 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a grainy pate maison, some tiny, can't-miss mussels in saffron caper 
sauce, garlicky escargots a la Bourguignonne or something the chef calls Black 
Sheep tri-shrimp: three large shrimp with aioli (garlic mayonnaise), rouille (a 
similar suspension livened up with red pepper and spices), and a pale green 
sauce made with pureed cilantro. There are often special appetizers, such as 
the succulent fresh foie gras with raspberry sauce that I tried. If that is 
available, Boufford has several Sauternes and Alsatian Gewurztraminers to match 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The main courses are mostly flame-broiled meats, grain-fed lamb, New York 
steak, duck breast and chicken breast. These meats are served with a choice of 
oil-based sauces, pesto, herb garlic and Provencal, the last being the herb 
garlic dressing with thyme and olive added to it. They're OK. 
</P>
<P>
The thing to watch for, though, is the daily special, often a classic regional 
French dish such as bourride, cassoulet or choucroute. These are the best 
things to eat here, and Boufford adheres to the authentic recipes as closely as 
he possibly can. And frankly, his cooking seems to be better when he's not 
wandering off on his own. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment Boufford is featuring maigret de canard, specially fattened duck 
breast that he gets from Ariane Daguin, daughter of Andre Daguin, one of 
Gascony's most celebrated chefs. This maigret comes from New Jersey, and it is 
one of the best products you can buy. I urge you to try it, for its exceptional 
richness and depth of flavor. There is a whirlwind of good Bordeaux and 
California Cabernets on the wine list to enjoy with it. 
</P>
<P>
Another off-menu dish you'll want to try is one almost always on hand, confit 
de canard. This is duck preserved in its own fat, and the chef prepares it by 
the bucket. It sounds richer than it is, actually. When cooked, the fat is 
usually steamed or sauteed off, leaving a complex, slightly stringy meat. 
</P>
<P>
Boufford serves his confit on a bed of pasta, as if France and Italy had 
magically become one country. On the back of the menu, it happens, there is a 
map of the two countries, along with a reference to the "ancient mystical 
country of Francaly." An appealing fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert is not a strong point at this restaurant, but the kitchen makes an 
honest effort to please. There is a handsome cheese board with Laura Chenel 
chevre, St. An dre and a runny Brie, among others, plus a fine flourless 
chocolate torte and a solid pear tart with homemade creme fraizche. The others, 
I regret to say, are not worth consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when you could have more wine to end the meal -- a vintage port, 
say, or something from the extensive list of dessert wines. The prices for all 
wines, incidentally, are more than reasonable. To give an example, Ric Forman's 
Cabernet is $60 at one of the hotter local restaurants but only $40 here. If 
$40 seems steep, there are dozens of wines here under $25 you will be delighted 
to drink. And if money is truly no object, how about a '61 Chateau d'Yquem for 
$600, or a private tasting of Domaine de la Romanee Conti for $1,500? 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen hundred dollars. That's serious money. Boufford, it's obvious, is not 
kidding around. 
</P>
<P>
Black Sheep Bistro is moderately priced. Appetizers are $6 to $8. Pastas are 
$12 to $17. Main courses are $14 to $23.
