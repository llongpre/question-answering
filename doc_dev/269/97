<LEADPARA>  (box) Cornmeal: Plain old cornmeal won't do. You need cornmeal milled
specifically for polenta. But you don't have to get too fancy. Chef Paul
Carrera buys his at Safeway (Pheasant brand). I prefer the coarse yellow
polenta to the fine-grained version. And yellow polenta has a much more
appealing color than polenta made with white corn. Instant polenta cooks up in
only about five minutes and works especially well if you're making firm
polenta that will later be fried or grilled. Fantastic Foods in Novato makes
an instant polenta mix that is already seasoned so it has more limited uses.;
(box)Liquid: Water is the standard medium for cooking polenta. However,
chicken stock makes a wonderful polenta that's rich enough to allow you to cut
back on cheese and butter. Chef Clyde Griesbach makes a polenta soup by using
extra amounts of chicken stock so that a very loose polenta is achieved. To
that he adds a touch of cream and some shredded fontina cheese. Then he runs
it briefly under the broiler. Milk also makes a fine polenta. Extra light (1
percent) milk gives a creamy texture that makes a perfect breakfast polenta
without loads of fat.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  (box)Cheese: After Parmesan, the most popular polenta cheeses are Gorgonzola
and fontina. Italian fontina is much more flavorful -- and alas, more
expensive -- than Swedish imitations. Rather than using ersatz Parmesan,
consider aged asiago and dry, aged jack cheeses. But almost any cheese can be
used depending on the style of polenta you desire. Greek polenta? Feta cheese.
Swiss? Gruyere. And so on.; (box)Seasoning: As with many grains, polenta soaks
up salt and other seasoning like a sponge. Figure on one to two teaspoons of
salt for each cup of polenta. Generally, other seasonings are reserved for the
sauce that goes with polenta but there's no reason why you can't experiment
with say, some ground cumin for a Moroccan polenta.; (box)Equipment: A
heavy-bottomed pot is a must for polenta making on the stove. This keeps the
polenta from burning. If you don't have a sturdy wire whip that will hold up
during the entire cooking process, cook the polenta part way with whatever
whip you have and finish with a wooden spoon. The spoon should have a long
handle though. As the polenta thickens, it spits.; (box)Microwave: Unlike
risotto, polenta cooks superbly in the microwave. Despite minimal stirring,
polenta emerges creamy and delicious. Adapting Barbara Kafka's recipes in
"Microwave Gourmet" (William Morrow and Co., $19.95), you can microwave soft
polenta by combining 4 cups water, 3/4 cup polenta and 1 1/2 teaspoons salts
in a 2-quart souffle dish. Cook, uncovered, at 100 percent power for 6
minutes. Stir well, cover loosely with a paper towel, and cook 6 minutes more.
(If using a low-wattage oven, increase cooking to 9 minutes uncovered and 9
minutes covered.) Add 3 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Let
stand 3 minutes and serve. Makes about 4 servings.; (box)Holding: Polenta can
be made ahead and held for several hours (Carrera holds his for up to 12
hours). Follow the basic polenta recipe, then put it into a double boiler that
has been liberally coated with butter. Stir every 10 minutes or so and add hot
water or stock if the polenta begins to stiffen too much.  </TEXT>
