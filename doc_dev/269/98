   Maytag Corp. said its Dixie-Narco Inc. unit sued its former chief executive officer for establishing a competing soft-drink vending machine business. 

   The Dixie-Narco subsidiary filed suit against Roy Steeley, also a former Maytag director, in federal district court in Alexandria, Va. 
The suit asserts that Mr. Steeley breached contractual obligations to Dixie-Narco, a vending machine producer, in setting up a rival concern. 
It asks for unspecified damages and seeks a restraining order against Mr. Steeley. 

   Mr. Steeley couldn't be reached for comment. 

   An attorney for Maytag said court affidavits show that, among other things, Mr. Steeley attempted to recruit employees of Dixie-Narco at his own going-away party at the company earlier this month. 

   Maytag makes kitchen and laundry appliances.
