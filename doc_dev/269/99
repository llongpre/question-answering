   America's steel-using manufacturers are split
over whether steel import quotas should be extended by the Bush
administration when they expire in the fall.
   A coalition of manufacturers opposed to the quotas got some
competition Wednesday when a rival group led by Chrysler, Maytag
and others was announced to lobby on behalf of the import curbs.
   The new group claimed to have enlisted 374 members, including
makers of automobiles, home appliances, marine products, beverage
cans, tableware and farm equipment.
   The only thing the two coalitions have in common is that all
their members use steel as a raw material.
   The Coalition for a Competitive America was unveiled at a
Capitol press conference Wednesday by Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va., and executives from Chrysler Corp. of Detroit, Crown Cork
and Seal Co. of Philadelphia, Milton Can Co. of Elizabeth, N.J.,
UNR-Leavitt of Chicago, Maytag Corp. of Newton, Iowa, and others.
   Organizers said the coalition was created to help make the case
for continuing steel import quotas due to expire Sept. 30.
   ``Domestic steel producers have proven they can compete with any
steel producer in the world,'' said Rockefeller, chairman of the
Senate Steel Caucus. ``But they cannot compete with foreign
governments that pump billions of dollars in subsidies into their
state-owned steel operations.''
   The Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with
Japan, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa, the European Community
and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the
United States.
   Three days before last November's election, President Bush
pledged to continue the restraints in some form. But with the U.S.
steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the curbs believe
they can make a case for ending the program, or at least narrowing
its scope.
   The quota opponents have been led in part by Caterpillar Inc. of
Peoria, Ill. Caterpillar is part of the Coalition of American Steel
Using Manufacturers, a 300-member group that claims quotas have
driven up steel prices and caused product shortages.
   Members of the new coalition said they formed the group to show
that steel-consuming manufacturers are not widely opposed to trade
protection, as the older group suggests.
   Chrysler spokesman Richard Muller, UNR-Leavitt President Roy A.
Herman, Maytag government affairs counsel Douglass Horstman and
Crown Cork and Seal Vice President-Purchasing Ronald Thoma released
statements chronicling how the quotas had helped turn the ailing
steel industry around.
   Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the Senate and
House that would enable the Bush administration to begin
negotiating new quota agreements with America's steel-trading
partners.
   But Samuel Berger, counsel for the older Coalition of American
Steel Using Manufacturers, said in a telephone interview that the
new group was already on the defensive.
   ``I think they are concerned that the debate here has been
expanded beyond simply what's good for the steel industry. We've
succeeded in getting people to understand that the debate is over
what's good for the overall economy,'' Berger said.
