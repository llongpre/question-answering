   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said that The Wall Street Journal/Europe will print a portion of its circulation at a plant near Lucerne, Switzerland, owned by Ringier AG, beginning today. 

   The Wall Street Journal/Europe will transmit full-page images of each issue via satellite from its printing center in Heerlen, the Netherlands, to the Ringier plant. 
The plant will serve subscribers and newsstand buyers in Switzerland, Italy, Austria, and southern Germany. 

   The Wall Street Journal/Europe will be the first publication to use satellite technology to transmit full-page facsimile images within Europe. 

   Ringier, through its C.J. Bucher subsidiary, already prints the international editions of a number of foreign publications. 
Ringier publishes the largest selling daily newspaper in Switzerland and a number of other Swiss newspapers and specialty magazines. 

   For the six months ended Dec. 31, 1986, The Wall Street Journal/Europe's paid circulation averaged 37,500 copies daily, a 9% increase over the second half of 1985. 

   In addition to The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Wall Street Journal and The Asian Wall Street Journal, New York-based Dow Jones publishes Barron's magazine, U.S. and overseas newswires, a computerized news retrieval service, and radio and TV news reports.
