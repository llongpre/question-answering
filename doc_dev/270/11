   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it agreed to acquire approximately 4.4 million shares of Telerate Inc. for $30 a share, or $133.1 million. 

   In combination with an agreement announced last month to acquire 2.6 million shares of Telerate, this will boost Dow Jones's stake in the financial-information company to 44.8%. 

   Dow Jones said it is buying part of the approximately 20% Telerate interest held by Oklahoma Publishing Co. 
In August 1985, Dow Jones and Oklahoma Publishing jointly bought 52% of Telerate for $459.8 million. 
At that time, Dow Jones's stake totaled 32%. 
Last month Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, agreed to boost its Telerate interest to 35.4%, in a realignment of other holdings with Telerate. 

   "We have no present intention of acquiring more Telerate stock," a Dow Jones spokesman said. 

   The agreement was announced after the close of stock market trading yesterday. 
Telerate shares have risen recently, amid the stock market's general rally. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Telerate rose $1.125 a share to close at $32.125. 

   Dow Jones said the $30-a-share price was set "in arm's length negotiations" with Oklahoma Publishing. 
In August 1985, the two partners paid $20 a share for their Telerate investment. 

   Dow Jones said the latest agreement is subject to the expiration of the applicable waiting period under antitrust laws. 

   Telerate provides bond prices, currency rates and other financial data on computer terminals used by brokers, bankers and other finance professionals. 
For the year ended Sept. 30, 1986, Telerate earned $38.8 million on revenue of $210.4 million. 

   Oklahoma Publishing has interests in publishing, printing, broadcasting, energy, real estate and entertainment. 

   In addition to The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's, domestic and overseas newswires, the Dow Jones News/Retrieval computerized information service, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal and radio and television news reports. 
The wholly owned Ottaway Newspapers publishes daily newspapers in 22 communities. 
Richard D. Irwin Inc., another subsidiary, publishes college textbooks and books for business executives.
