   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it completed the previously announced sale of its college textbook-publishing subsidiary, Richard D. Irwin Inc., to Times Mirror Co., Los Angeles, for $135 million. 

   Dow Jones said the sale reflects a decision to focus its resources on its core operations: business newspapers and periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers. 

   New York-based Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, domestic and overseas newswires, Dow Jones News/Retrieval, Barron's magazine, the Far Eastern Economic Review, The Wall Street Journal/Europe and The Asian Wall Street Journal. 
It owns the Ottaway community newspaper group, 56% of Telerate Inc., and broadcasts radio and television news reports. 
Times Mirror is a newspaper and communications concern.
