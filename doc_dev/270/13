   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Friday it was boosting
advertising rates for 1991 at The Wall Street Journal, the nation's
largest daily newspaper.
   At the same time, the company confirmed it was closing the
composing operations at its printing plant in Naperville, Ill., and
transferring the plant's responsibilities to a plant in Dallas, for
a net reduction of 30 jobs.
   The moves come as Dow Jones begins an austerity program under
which it has frozen capital spending, is trying to hold salary
spending in 1991 at 1990 levels and is taking other steps to cut
costs.
   Two weeks ago, Dow Jones said it was boosting the cover price of
the Journal to 75 cents from 50 cents effective Dec. 3 and the
yearly subscription price by 7.8 percent to $109.
   The Journal has the largest daily circulation of any U.S.
newspaper, averaging about 1.85 million in the six months ended
Sept. 30.
   The company's earnings have fallen this year as the slump on
Wall Street and the economy as a whole has shown up in sharply
reduced advertising spending by financial companies.
   The new ad rates, which take effect Jan. 2, 1991, include
increases of 6 percent for national edition advertising and bigger
increases for regional and overseas editions.
   The increase will boost the cost of a full-page ad in the
national edition of the Journal to $105,352.
   Rates in the Eastern, Midwest, Western and Southwest editions
will increase 7 percent while regional rates will rise an average
of 9 percent.
   The ad rates will jump 12 percent for the Wall Street Journal
Europe and 10 percent for the Asian Wall Street Journal and The
Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones, said the closing of the
composing operation at the Naperville plant effective in January
reflects technological improvements that enable the company to cut
the number of its composing operations to three from four
nationwide.
   He said the closing would mean a cost savings and an improvement
in operating efficiency but would not adversely affect the quality
of the newspaper.
   He said some of the 40 people employed in the composing
operation in Naperville would be transferred to Dallas, but that
the company expected there would be a net reduction of 30 jobs.
   In addition to the Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's
magazine, the Ottaway Group of community newspapers and electronic
business information services. Its Telerate Inc. subsidiary
provides financial information.
