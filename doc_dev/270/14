   HONG KONG -- The Asian Wall Street Journal has decided not
to appeal its conviction for contempt of court in Singapore.
   Last month, the Singapore High Court ruled that the daily
newspaper, which is based in Hong Kong, and its editor and
publisher were guilty of contempt over an article published
in the paper in 1989. The court fined them 9,000 Singapore
dollars (US$5,266) and ordered them to pay the costs of the
legal proceedings. It also found the printer and distributor
of the Asian Journal in Singapore guilty, but didn't impose
any penalty on them.

   The article at issue contained a comment by a senior
officer of Dow Jones &amp; Co., owner of the weekly Far Eastern
Economic Review, criticizing a Singapore court's libel
judgment against the Review.
   In New York, a spokesman for Dow Jones, which is also
majority owner of the Asian Journal, said the company
continues to believe that the court's contempt judgment
against the paper wasn't warranted by the facts. "But under
the circumstances, and particularly considering the small
size of the fines imposed, we have concluded that the
expenditure of time and money necessary to appeal is not
called for," he said.
   In addition to The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones's
business includes Telerate and other information services,
Barron's magazine and other U.S. and international business
publications, and the Ottaway group of community newspapers.
