   The Asian Wall Street Journal has the right to a court hearing into whether the Singapore government acted legally in restricting the newspaper's circulation, Justice T.S. Sinnathuray ruled in Singapore High Court. 

   He made the decision over the objections of Attorney General Tan Boon Teik, who argued that the order to curtail the newspaper's circulation, made by Communications and Information Minister Yeo Ning Hong, was a "political" action beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. 

   In addition to requesting a hearing, the newspaper also sought a stay of the Feb. 9 decision by the minister to restrict sales to 400 copies a day from about 5,000. 
Justice Sinnathuray denied the stay. 

   No date has been set for the full hearing. 

   The Asian Journal's circulation was restricted under the government's authority to curb any publication deemed to be "engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore." 

   The dispute between the Singapore government and the newspaper arose over a Dec. 12, 1986, Asian Journal story concerning the establishment of a new secondary securities market in Singapore. 
A Singapore government official branded the story inaccurate and biased and demanded that the newspaper print a letter that accused the Journal's Singapore-based correspondent of slanting his reportage. 

   The Asian Journal's editor and publisher, Fred Zimmerman, said a thorough investigation of the facts indicated there were no inaccuracies or bias. 
The newspaper refused to print the letter as written, but offered the official a chance to rewrite it. 
After an exchange of letters, the minister of communications and information claimed the government's right of reply had been denied, and he ordered the effective ban on the Asian Journal's circulation. 

   Far from denying the Singapore government its right of reply, Mr. Zimmerman said, in 1986 the Asian Journal published a total of 14 letters from Singapore government officials, occupying "only 14 fewer inches than the space devoted to letters from officials of all other governments combined." 

   The Asian Journal is published by New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co. Dow Jones also publishes The Wall Street Journal and The Wall Street Journal/Europe.
