   Mr. Kann and Mr. Burenga have been serving as chief
executive officer and chief operating officer, respectively,
since Jan. 1 of this year and will continue in those
positions. Mr. Phillips had served as chief executive officer
since March 1975; Mr. Kann had been chief operating officer
since mid-1989.
   Mr. Kann will continue as publisher of The Wall Street

Journal's history.
   Mr. Kann and Mr. Burenga were elected to their new
positions yesterday at the regular monthly meeting of Dow
Jones's board. Mr. Phillips will remain a director of Dow
Jones.
   Mr. Kann, 48, began his career with Dow Jones in 1964 as a
reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Pittsburgh. In 1967,
after a year in the Los Angeles bureau, he became the
Journal's reporter in Vietnam. He moved to Hong Kong in 1968
as roving correspondent in Asia for the paper and was awarded
a Pulitzer Prize in 1972 for his coverage of the 1971
India-Pakistan War.
   In 1976, Mr. Kann was named the first publisher and editor
of The Asian Wall Street Journal and simultaneously served as
Dow Jones's corporate representative in Asia. He returned to
the U.S. in March 1979 and became assistant to the chairman.
   Later in 1979, Mr. Kann was appointed associate publisher
of The Wall Street Journal and subsequently that year was
named a vice president of Dow Jones. In January 1985, he was
named executive vice president of Dow Jones and in 1987 he
was elected a director of the company. In January 1989, he
became publisher of the Journal and editorial director of Dow
Jones's print publications. In July that year, he became
president and chief operating officer of Dow Jones.
   Mr. Burenga, 47, joined Dow Jones in 1966 as a budget
accountant at the company's South Brunswick, N.J., facility.
In 1968 he was named assistant manager of data processing
control; in 1970, staff assistant for systems development;
and in 1972, manager of systems development and control. In
1977 he became circulation marketing manager of The Wall
Street Journal and Barron's magazine. In 1979, he was
appointed circulation sales director.
   Mr. Burenga became a vice president of The Wall Street
Journal Group in 1980 and was named vice
president/circulation and circulation director later that
year. He was appointed senior vice president of Dow Jones and
chief financial and administrative officer in 1986. He was
named general manager of Dow Jones and The Wall Street
Journal in January 1989. He was elected to the Dow Jones
board in October 1990 and became executive vice president and
chief operating officer Jan. 1 this year.
   In addition to The Wall Street Journal and its overseas
editions, Dow Jones publishes Barron's and other periodicals
and the Ottaway group of community newspapers. The company
also publishes a variety of electronic business news and
information services. Its Telerate Inc. subsidiary is a
global provider of real-time financial information.
