   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it agreed to sell its college textbook-publishing subsidiary, Richard D. Irwin Inc., to Times Mirror Co., Los Angeles, for $135 million. 

   Warren H. Phillips, chairman, and Ray Shaw, president, said the sale reflects Dow Jones's decision to focus its resources more fully on its core operations: business newspapers and periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers. 
Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal. 

   Dow Jones purchased Homewood, Ill.-based Irwin in 1975. 
The unit's 1987 sales were about $62 million. 

   Dow Jones expects to report a gain on the sale of about $61 million, or 63 cents a share. 
The sale is expected to close in early February, subject to expiration of the waiting period under federal antitrust statutes. 
Proceeds will be used to pay down some recent commercial paper borrowings as well as to invest in continuing businesses, including electronic publishing and The Wall Street Journal. 

   In last year's first quarter, Dow Jones had net income of $66.7 million, or 69 cents a share, on revenue of $285.6 million. 

   Dow Jones shares closed yesterday at $30, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Irwin, which has 390 employees, publishes three college textbook imprints --Irwin, Business Publications Inc. and Dorsey Press, and a fourth imprint, Dow Jones-Irwin, which publishes books for the business and financial markets. 
Times Mirror will have the right to use the Dow Jones-Irwin name for three years. 

   Mr. Phillips and Mr. Shaw said the decision to sell Irwin "was predicated on our ability to select a buyer who would continue to operate the Irwin company as a separate business; who would respect its traditions; who would assure fair treatment of Irwin employees and provide for personnel policies and programs that are substantially similar; and who would maintain Irwin's valued author and customer relationships. 
We are satisfied that each of these goals has been realized. 
Times Mirror was our first choice." 

   Robert A. Schmitz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Irwin, will continue with the book company. 

   Dow Jones also publishes Barron's magazine, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal, domestic and overseas newswires, computerized information retrieval services, and radio and television news reports. 
The company owns 56% of Telerate Inc., a supplier of computerized financial information. 
Ottaway Newspapers Inc., a subsidiary, publishes 23 daily community newspapers. 

   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive of Times Mirror, said the acquisition will "dramatically accelerate our growth" in the professional and book publishing field. 

   In the past two years, Times Mirror has been selling certain assets and acquiring others to focus on its core businesses of newspaper and magazine publishing, broadcast and cable television and professional information and book publishing. 

   Times Mirror's professional publishing group is made up of six companies that produce legal, medical, scientific, college and electronic publications, training programs for business and industry, flight information, microcomputer software and videodisks. 
A Times Mirror spokeswoman said the company hasn't yet determined whether it will merge the Irwin textbook publishing operations into Times Mirror's C.V. Mosby Co. unit, which also publishes college texts and journals in addition to medical, nursing and dental publications. 

   The professional publishing group accounted for $389.1 million, or about 13%, of Times Mirror's $2.95 billion revenue in 1986. 
In the first nine months of 1987, professional publishing contributed $323.5 million, or about 14%, to Times Mirror's $2.29 billion revenue.
