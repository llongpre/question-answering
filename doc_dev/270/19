   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. promoted two executives at The
Wall Street Journal, naming Norman Pearlstine executive
editor and Paul E. Steiger to succeed him as managing editor.
   Peter Kann, publisher of the Journal and president of Dow
Jones, announced the promotions, noting that in some ways the
new duties involve assignments that the two effectively have
been performing, as well as reflect expanded responsibilities
for both executives. The positions are the two top
news-department executive positions at the Journal.

   As executive editor, Mr. Pearlstine will remain
responsible for, and actively involved in, the overall news
direction of the paper. "He also will be spending more of his
time on related Journal Group activities," Mr. Kann said,
including a magazine venture with Hearst Corp., plans for
further book publishing, a classroom edition to be launched
this fall, and other ventures to extend the Journal's
publishing franchise.
   In addition, the television unit that produces The Wall
Street Journal Report and other programming will report to
Mr. Pearlstine. Mr. Kann said the company will be "seeking
new opportunities for the Journal and Dow Jones in business
television, particularly cable."
   Several previous managing editors have later served as
executive editor of the Journal, including Dow Jones's
Chairman Warren Phillips, although the post hasn't been
filled in recent years.
   Reporting to Mr. Pearlstine, Mr. Steiger will be
responsible for all day-to-day news operations of the
Journal, with all news department editors and bureau chiefs
reporting to him. Mr. Pearlstine reports to Mr. Kann, as does
Robert L. Bartley, 53 years old, the Journal's editor
responsible for editorial and opinion pages.
   Mr. Steiger also will join the Journal's operating
committee, comprising all Journal Group department heads.
   Mr. Kann noted that the two executives "have been partners
in all significant news initiatives and improvements" since
Mr. Pearlstine became managing editor in 1983. At a meeting
with editors, Mr. Pearlstine noted that one of his first
decisions was to seek to bring Mr. Steiger back to the
Journal. "Having competed against him for a number of years,
I was sick of it," he said.
   Mr. Steiger, 48 years old, joined the Journal as a staff
reporter in the San Francisco bureau in 1966, and left in
1968 to become a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times. In
the 1970s, he was an economic correspondent in the Times
Washington bureau and returned to Los Angeles in 1978 as
business editor.
   Mr. Steiger rejoined the Journal as an assistant managing
editor in 1983, and was named deputy managing editor in April
1985. Mr. Steiger has won three Gerald Loeb awards and two
John Hancock awards for his economic and business coverage.
   Mr. Pearlstine, also 48 years old, joined The Wall Street
Journal in 1967 as a reporter in the Dallas bureau. He
subsequently served in the Detroit and Los Angeles bureaus,
before being named the Journal's Tokyo bureau chief in 1973.
In March 1976, a few months before the start-up of The Asian
Wall Street Journal in Hong Kong, he was named its managing
editor.
   In 1978, Mr. Pearlstine resigned from the Asian Journal to
become an executive editor of Forbes magazine. He returned to
The Wall Street Journal in 1980 as national news editor in
New York, and in 1982 was named editor and publisher of The
Wall Street Journal Europe, in Brussels.
   Mr. Pearlstine was named managing editor of The Wall
Street Journal in September 1983, and later was named a vice
president of the Journal and a member of the Dow Jones
management committee, the company's corporatewide policy
committee.
   Dow Jones also publishes Barron's magazine, newswires and
community newspapers. Its Telerate Inc. subsidiary provides
electronic financial quotations and information.
