   Dow Jones &amp; Co. reported record revenue and earnings for the second quarter and first half. 

   Net income for the quarter increased 17% to $49.1 million, or 51 cents a share, from $42 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 9.7% to $313.1 million from $285.3 million. 

   Dow Jones's first-half earnings climbed 12% to $115.8 million, or $1.20 a share, from $103.8 million, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier. 
The 1987 half includes an after-tax gain of $29.4 million from the first-quarter sale of the company's 18.9% interest in South China Morning Post Ltd. 
The year-earlier half includes a gain of $31.4 million from the sale of two million common shares of Continental Cablevision Inc. 

   Excluding one-time gains from each period, first-half earnings rose 19% to $86.5 million, or 89 cents a share, from $72.4 million, or 75 cents a share. 

   Six-month revenue totaled $598.6 million, a 9.8% increase from $545 million a year earlier. 

   Operating earnings -- which consist of earnings from operations before taxes, nonrecurring items, interest income, interest expense and equity income -- increased 4.9% in the second quarter and 6.5% in the half. 
The proportionately larger gains in net income reflect a decline in the federal tax rate and significant increases in earnings from Dow Jones's newsprint mill affiliates and its 45% stake in Telerate Inc. 

   Wall Street Journal advertising linage rose 0.8% in the quarter and 2.3% in the half, compared with year-earlier levels. 
The Journal's circulation on June 30 was slightly above a year earlier. 

   Dow Jones Information Services, the company's newswire and electronic publishing arm, continued to show strong gains. 
Revenue rose 23% in the second quarter and 24% in the half. 

   Advertising linage at Ottaway Newspapers Inc., a subsidiary that publishes newspapers in 22 communities, increased 6% in the quarter and 5.3% in the first six months. 
Circulation rose in both periods. 

   At Barron's magazine, advertising linage increased 12.6% in the second quarter and 10.4% in the first half. 
Circulation on June 30 was about the same as a year earlier. 

   Richard D. Irwin Inc., the subsidiary that publishes college texts and books for business executives, reported revenue gains of 28% for the quarter and 15.5% for the first half. 

   Dow Jones also publishes The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal and radio and television news reports.
