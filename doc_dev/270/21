   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said three company executives were elected new members of the board. 

   The three are William L. Dunn, 51 years old, an executive vice president and president of the Information Services group; Peter R. Kann, 44, an executive vice president, associate publisher of The Wall Street Journal and president of the Magazine and International groups; and James H. Ottaway Jr., 49, a senior vice president, president of the Affiliated Companies group and chairman and chief executive officer of Ottaway Newspapers, the community newspapers operation of Dow Jones. 

   Donald A. Macdonald, vice chairman emeritus, and Vermont Royster, a former senior vice president, retired from the board. 
As a result, the board was increased to 17 members from 16. 

   At the annual meeting, stockholders approved an amendment that limits directors' liability in certain circumstances, as permitted under recent legislation in Delaware. 
In addition, shareholders rejected a proposal from a stockholder to have all directors elected annually rather than through a staggered system. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, newswires, computerized information retrieval services, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal, radio and television news reports, Ottaway community newspapers and Richard D. Irwin text and professional books.
