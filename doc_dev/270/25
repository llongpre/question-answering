   Dow Jones &amp; Co. reported a 14% rise in fourth-quarter net income, aided by a 6.3% increase in advertising linage at The Wall Street Journal. 

   The publishing concern's quarterly net income rose to $46.5 million, or 48 cents a share, from $40.9 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. 

   Profit for the most recent quarter includes a nonrecurring gain of $2.8 million, or three cents a share, from the sale of investments. 
Year-earlier quarterly earnings include $4.4 million, or five cents a share, from the sale of land. 

   Excluding the one-time items, earnings increased 20% in the quarter. 
Revenue climbed 12% to $312 million from $279.1 million. 

   For all 1986, Dow Jones earnings increased 32% to a record $183.4 million, or $1.89 a share, from $138.6 million, or $1.43 a share. 
The year-ago quarterly and annual per-share figures have been adjusted to reflect a 50% stock dividend issued in June in the form of Class B common shares. 

   Full-year earnings for 1986 also include a first-quarter gain of $31.4 million, or 32 cents a share, from the sale of part of the company's stake in Continental Cablevision Inc. Annual profit rose 11% excluding one-time items in both years. 
Annual revenue increased 9% to $1.13 billion from $1.04 billion. 

   Circulation of The Wall Street Journal ended 1986 at 2,039,300, up 1.8% from 2,002,800 at the end of 1985. 
Ad linage for the Journal has risen in each of the past four months, the company said. 
Journal ad linage for the year was down 1.7%, reflecting "the widespread softness experienced in 1986 by the national media generally," the company said. 

   Gains by the company's information services group and by the Ottaway community newspaper operations were particularly strong in 1986, Dow Jones said. 
The company said earnings also benefited from a companywide effort to improve operating efficiency. 

   The information services group's revenue for the year increased 23% to $125.8 million. 
Pre-tax operating earnings more than doubled to $41.4 million from $17.7 million for the group, which includes financial and business news wires and a computerized news-retrieval service. 

   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the company's community newspaper unit, posted an 11% revenue increase for the year to $195.1 million, with gains in advertising linage and circulation. 
Pre-tax operating profit rose 19% to $41.9 million. 

   Richard D. Irwin Inc., the company's book publishing unit, recorded a 4.9% revenue rise in 1986 to $57.2 million. 
Pre-tax operating profit at the unit increased 12% to $8.6 million. 

   Circulation of The Wall Street Journal/Europe rose 6.4% for the year to 36,400. 
Advertising revenue gained 27% for the year at the Brussels, Belgium-based newspaper, Dow Jones said. 

   Circulation rose 15% at The Asian Wall Street Journal to 35,100, with advertising revenue up 11%. 

   Barron's magazine had a 5.7% increase in circulation for the year to 279,200. 
The magazine also experienced gains in ad linage and revenue.
