   Circulation in Singapore of the Far Eastern Economic Review has been severely restricted by the government, which asserted that the magazine's reporting about the arrest and detention of 22 young people in May and June for alleged involvement in a Marxist conspiracy contained errors of omission or commission. 

   The weekly Hong Kong-based magazine's circulation was cut to 500 copies an issue, effective tomorrow. 
The Review's current circulation in Singapore is 9,000, out of total sales of 74,500. 

   In a related development, lawyers acting for Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew have demanded a retraction, an apology and unspecified damages for a Dec. 17 article in the magazine that contradicted the government's version of events surrounding the detentions of the alleged Marxists. 

   The magazine is published by Far Eastern Economic Review Ltd., a subsidiary of New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co. Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, The Asian Wall Street Journal and The Wall Street Journal/Europe. 

   The Singapore authorities cut the Review's circulation under an amendment passed in August 1986 to the Newspapers and Printing Presses Act. 
The amendment allows such action if a publication is deemed to be "involving itself in domestic politics." 
The government previously has used the act to restrict the circulation in Singapore of The Asian Wall Street Journal, Time magazine and Asiaweek. 
Time and Asiaweek are published by Time Inc. Dow Jones is protesting the continued restriction of the Asian Journal's circulation. 
Asiaweek's circulation also remains restricted. 

   The restriction on the Review's Singapore circulation appears to represent a new direction on the part of the government. 
Previously, the government insisted only that it should have the right to reply to articles it felt were biased or incorrect, and suggested that international publications that published its letters would be allowed to circulate freely. 
The Asian Journal, Time and Asiaweek had their circulation curbed after refusing to publish in their entirety government replies on various controversies. 

   Over the past year, the Review has published a furious round of letters from Singapore government officials complaining about various articles. 

   Derek Davies, the Review's editor, said in Hong Kong that the magazine had been banned in other Asian countries over the years. 
"So this isn't a new experience for us," he said. 
"Any magazine that attempts to tell it like it is, is at risk."
