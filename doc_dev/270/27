   Dow Jones &amp; Co. expects to earn between $40.1 million and $44.9 million in the fourth quarter, or between 42 cents and 47 cents a share, compared with earnings of $40.9 million, or 42 cents a share, a year ago. 

   The year-ago quarter includes a gain of five cents a share from the sale of land. 

   Warren H. Phillips, chairman and chief executive officer, told securities analysts the company's 1986 earnings should be between $176.9 million and $181.8 million, or between $1.83 and $1.88 a share, a 28% to 31% increase over 1985 earnings of $138.6 million, or $1.43 a share. 

   In 1987, Dow Jones expects "another record year for revenue and earnings," said Kenneth L. Burenga, chief financial officer. 

   The 1985 per-share results are adjusted to reflect a 50% stock dividend paid in June of 1986. 

   The full-year 1986 results will include a net gain of $31.4 million on the sale of some of the company's stake in Continental Cablevision Inc. Without the gain, 1986 earnings would be between $1.51 and $1.56 a share, Mr. Phillips said. 
Dow Jones still owns 17% of Continental Cablevision. 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Dow Jones closed at $41.75, up $1.25. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal and other newspapers, Barron's magazine, domestic and overseas newswires, a computerized news retrieval service, radio and television news reports, college texts and books for executives. 

   For the year, pre-tax operating income in the company's National Publications segment, which includes the Journal, will be "about even" with last year's results, largely due to sluggish national advertising, Mr. Burenga said. 
Revenue in the segment, which will account for about 65% of total Dow Jones revenue in 1986, will be up a modest 5% from last year, he said. 

   Pre-tax operating income for the Information Services segment will more than double in 1986 from last year, and pre-tax operating income from the Community Newspapers segment will be up more than 20%, he said. 

   Peter R. Kann, an executive vice president of Dow Jones and associate publisher of the Journal, said circulation of the Journal will be up more than 2% over last year's total. 

   Total advertising linage for the year is expected to be off less than 3%, he said. 
Excluding classified advertising, Mr. Kann said, "other linage would be roughly even with 1985." 
Advertising linage was up 8.8% in November on a per-issue basis. 

   Advertising linage in The Wall Street Journal/Europe will be up about 5% for the year, he said, with circulation up nearly 12% to more than 38,000. 

   Linage at The Asian Wall Street Journal is "running slightly below" last year, Mr. Kann said, while circulation is expected to be up about 7% to more than 32,000. 

   For 1987, the company is expecting its total tax rate to shrink to between 42% and 44% compared with 46% this year. 
This should result in about a 7.5% increase in earnings, Mr. Burenga said. 
Capital spending will be "in the $60 million to $80 million range," he said, or about the same as this year, but down sharply from 1984 levels of $155 million. 
Depreciation will be up about 6% to between $65 million and $75 million, Mr. Burenga said. 

   Mr. Kann said the Journal is "budgeting for slight linage gains" in 1987. 
Circulation is expected to grow "in the 1% to 3% range," said Mr. Burenga.
