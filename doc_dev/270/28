   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire about a 14% interest in Groupe Expansion S.A., a French business publishing company. 

   Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Groupe Expansion publishes a variety of French-language periodicals, including L'Expansion, a fortnightly business, economic and financial magazine with a circulation of 170,000, and La Vie Francaise, a weekly magazine with 112,000 circulation that covers personal finance, politics, business, the financial markets, taxes and management. 
Groupe Expansion was founded by Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber, who holds about 24% of its stock. 

   The Paris-based company also publishes La Tribune, a daily business and economic newspaper with a circulation of 34,000; L'Agefi, a financial newspaper with a daily circulation of 7,000 and a separate Swiss edition; and L'Enterprise, a monthly business magazine with a circulation of 65,000 directed at entrepreneurs and managers of small businesses. 

   Mr. Servan-Schreiber, Groupe Expansion's president, said his publications now will be able to publish Dow Jones news stories and call on Dow Jones for help with the technical and commercial development of the group's daily publications. 
"It is now of crucial importance for European publishers to have access to global financial and business news," he said. 
"Dow Jones, by its high quality standards and the fact that it publishes daily newspapers world-wide, represents for us the best possible alliance to this effect." 

   Groupe Expansion subsidiaries run management and economic seminars and publish a controlled-circulation tourism magazine and newsletters on economics, politics and the stock market. 

   Groupe Expansion, which isn't traded publicly, doesn't usually report profit figures. 
It had sales of 370 million French francs ($60.2 million) last year, up 23% from 300 million francs in 1985. 
It has projected sales of 700 million francs for this year, reflecting several recent acquisitions. 

   Peter R. Kann, executive vice president of Dow Jones and president of the company's International Group, will sit on Groupe Expansion's 12-member board. 
He said, "We are delighted to have the opportunity to become associated with the premier French business publisher. 
Groupe Expansion shares our publishing values and our vision of the ever-increasing importance of global business news and information. 
We look forward to a long and successful affiliation." 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, domestic and overseas newswires, computerized information retrieval services, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal and radio and television news reports. 
Ottaway Newspapers Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, publishes 22 daily community newspapers. 
Richard D. Irwin Inc., another wholly owned subsidiary, publishes college textbooks and books for business executives.
