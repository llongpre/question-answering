   HONG KONG -- The Singapore government said it would allow
The Asian Wall Street Journal to resume limited circulation
in the country.
   A statement issued yesterday by the Ministry of
Information and the Arts said the business daily would be
able to sell as many as 2,500 copies a day, beginning Oct. 1.
New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co., majority owner of the Asian
Journal, applied for a distribution permit on Monday.

   "We are extremely pleased that the government has
responded favorably to our application and responded so
promptly," Barry Wain, editor of the Asian Journal, said.
"However, we hope that the government ultimately will allow
the market to determine our sales."
   The government cut the Asian Journal's circulation in
Singapore to 400 copies a day from 5,000 in February 1987
after accusing the paper of interfering in domestic politics.
Dow Jones withdrew the remaining circulation last October
when Singapore prepared to adopt regulations covering the
domestic distribution of overseas publications.
   The regulations require a foreign publication to obtain an
annual distribution permit if it circulates more than 300
copies in Singapore and if it carries articles about politics
and current affairs in Southeast Asia. The permit also can
limit the number of copies that may be distributed.
   In addition, the regulations require a foreign publication
that falls under the rules to post a security deposit that
can be put toward any legal cost the publication might incur.
The publication also is required to appoint an agent in
Singapore to receive any legal notices. The regulations were
adopted as an amendment to the Newspaper and Printing Presses
Act.
   In an editorial last October explaining the withdrawal of
the Asian Journal's remaining circulation, Dow Jones said:
"What worries us is the purpose to which, five years of
experience warns us, these powers will be put." Since Goh
Chok Tong took over as prime minister in November, however,
Singapore appears to be liberalizing its attitude toward the
foreign press. That liberalization prompted Dow Jones to
apply to resume circulating the paper.
   The Ministry of Information and the Arts said the Asian
Journal would post a security deposit of 200,000 Singapore
dollars (US$116,000).
   Dow Jones also publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's
magazine and other periodicals, electronic business
information services and community newspapers.
