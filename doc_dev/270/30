   Dow Jones &amp; Co. reported higher earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. 

   The publisher's fourth-quarter net income climbed 8.3% to $50.3 million, or 52 cents a share. 
Year-earlier net was $46.5 million, or 48 cents a share, including a nonrecurring gain of $2.8 million, or three cents a share. 
Revenue in the quarter advanced 34% to $417.2 million from $312 million. 

   Full-year net increased 11% to $203 million, or $2.10 a share, from $183.4 million, or $1.89 a share, in 1986. 
Revenue rose 16% to $1.31 billion from $1.13 billion. 

   Earnings in the year included an after-tax gain of $29.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from the sale of the company's 18.9% interest in South China Morning Post Ltd. 
In 1986, earnings included a gain of $34.1 million, or 35 cents a share, largely from the sale of a portion of Dow Jones's holdings in Continental Cablevision. 

   Excluding these transactions, 1987 earnings were $173.7 million, or $1.80 a share, an increase of 16% from comparable 1986 earnings of $149.2 million, or $1.54 a share. 

   The improvement in net income for the quarter and year reflects increased earnings from Dow Jones's stake in Telerate Inc. and the company's newsprint-mill affiliates, improved operating earnings at Information Services and Ottaway Newspapers, and a lower effective tax rate. 

   Dow Jones increased its interest in Telerate to 56% in September 1987. 
Telerate since has changed its reporting period from a fiscal year ended Sept. 30 to a calendar year, coinciding with that of Dow Jones. 
Telerate's earnings for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 1987, are included in Dow Jones's 1987 earnings by the equity method of accounting. 
In addition, Telerate's results for the quarter ended Dec. 31 are included through consolidation. 
As a result, fourth-quarter net income was enhanced by five cents a share. 

   Business Publications revenue increased 4% in the year to $846.6 million from $814 million in 1986. 
The segment's operating income, which is earnings from operations before taxes, interest, equity earnings and other adjustments to income, declined 14% in 1987 to $174.2 million. 
Business Publications includes the domestic and international editions of The Wall Street Journal, Barron's Business and Financial Weekly, the Far Eastern Economic Review and other publications, and Richard D. Irwin Inc. 

   The Information Services segment, including Telerate since Oct. 1, 1987, reported full-year revenue of $252.2 million, up 100% from $125.8 million in 1986 and operating earnings of $92.9 million, an increase of 125%. 
Excluding Telerate, Dow Jones Information Services, which operates financial and business newswires as well as computerized information-retrieval services, had a 24% increase in revenue and a 44% rise in operating income. 

   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the company's community-newspaper subsidiary, reported 1987 operating income of $47.4 million, up 13% from $41.9 million in 1986. 
Revenue increased 10.5% to $215.7 million, reflecting gains in circulation and advertising linage. 

   Wall Street Journal circulation ended 1987 at 2,049,400, up 0.5% from 2,039,300 at the end of 1986. 
Advertising linage for the year declined 2.3% on an actual basis and 2.7% on a per-issue basis, largely reflecting a sharp downturn in financial advertising following the October stock-market crash. 

   The Wall Street Journal/Europe ended 1987 with circulation of 43,000, an 18.2% gain from a year earlier, while ad linage increased an actual 12.9%. 
Advertising linage at The Asian Wall Street Journal increased an actual 6.7% in 1987 and circulation rose 1.3%, to 35,500. 

   Circulation gains at the Asian Journal were achieved despite sharp restrictions on the newspaper's circulation by the Singapore government.
