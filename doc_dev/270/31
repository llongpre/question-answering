   Dow Jones &amp; Co. agreed in principle to purchase nearly 5.3 million shares of Telerate Inc. common stock at a total cost of about $303.1 million from Forstmann Leff Associates, a New York-based investment firm. 
Completion of the transaction will bring Dow Jones's holdings of Telerate common to more than 26.4 million shares, or 56% of the total outstanding. 

   "The purchase represents our increasing confidence in Telerate's future and our desire to have a growing participation in that future," said Warren H. Phillips, chairman and chief executive officer of Dow Jones. 

   "The purchase is being financed through borrowings in the commercial paper market. 
There will be some modest short-term dilution but the investment will have a positive long-term impact on Dow Jones earnings," said Kenneth L. Burenga, senior vice president and chief financial officer. 

   Terms of the transaction indicate Dow Jones will pay $57.50 a share for the Telerate block. 
Telerate closed at $49.25, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 

   There are no plans at this time to make additional purchases of Telerate shares, Mr. Burenga said. 

   "Dow Jones and Telerate have worked closely together since 1978, when AP-Dow Jones, a Dow Jones affiliate that operates international business and financial newswires, became Telerate's overseas marketing agent," said Neil S. Hirsch, president and chief executive officer of Telerate. 
"It's been a mutually beneficial partnership. 
I am delighted that Dow Jones decided to increase its ownership in Telerate and I am confident our two companies will continue to work together in a harmonious, profitable way." 

   Dow Jones made its initial investment in Telerate in August 1985 when it joined Oklahoma Publishing Co. in the acquisition of 52% of the company's common stock. 
Dow Jones at that time acquired about 14.1 million shares, or a 32% interest. 

   Dow Jones increased its Telerate holdings early in 1987 when it purchased more than 4.4 million shares, or half of Oklahoma Publishing's position. 
Early in 1987 Dow Jones also exchanged its 25% interest in AP-Dow Jones/Telerate for an additional 2.6 million shares of Telerate. 
The 1987 transactions increased Dow Jones's Telerate ownership to 45%. 

   The purchase announced yesterday will increase Dow Jones's direct ownership to 56%. 
On a combined basis, Dow Jones and Oklahoma Publishing will own 65% of Telerate's shares. 

   Telerate, a leading supplier of computerized financial information, provides subscribers access to more than 30,000 video pages of real-time information on U.S. government securities, money market instruments, foreign exchange, financial futures and other financial instruments that are not traded on organized exchanges. 
Telerate data are now available on more than 52,000 display terminals throughout the world. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, computerized information services, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal, domestic and international news wires, radio and television reports, the Ottaway Group of 22 daily community newspapers and Richard D. Irwin textbooks.
