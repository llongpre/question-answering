   Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc., a leading
American publisher, plans to begin printing the Asian Wall Street
Journal in Thailand within the next few months, it was announced
Friday.
   The Journal will be printed for distribution in Thailand and
some other countries in the Southeast Asian region by The Nation
Publishing Group.
   A news release from the Thai group, which publishes the
English-language daily The Nation and several magazines, said a
contract was signed Friday between the two companies.
   ``This marks the first time that Thailand will be printing a
foreign aily newspaper through a satellite linkup, setting the
stage for Bangkok to become the new publishing center in the
region,'' the release said.
   The Journal is currently being printed in Tokyo, Singapore and
Hong Kong, where the newspaper has its headquarters. It is
distributed mainly in Asia.
   The government banned the newspaper for five days last November
for printing a story that it said insulted the Buddhist supreme
patriarch. It reinstated the paper after its editor said he
regretted any offense caused.
   Dow Jones also owns the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, the Far
Eastern Economic Review and a number of other publications. It has
a 4 percent equity in The Nation Publishing Group.
