   The Singapore government lifted restrictions against Time magazine and said full circulation will resume with the issue of July 13, about nine months after the government reduced the magazine's circulation to 2,000 copies from 18,000. 

   Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information had cut Time's circulation because the magazine refused to print in full an official's letter responding to an article about threats to parliamentary free speech. 
However, Time later printed the letter. 

   Time's circulation was curbed under Singapore's amended Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, which was approved by Parliament last August. 

   Also under that act, circulation of The Asian Wall Street Journal, published by Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia), was restricted Feb. 9 because it also refused to publish a letter from a government official. 

   Last month, Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia), which is 80%-owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of the U.S., filed a motion in the Singapore High Court for leave to quash a government order that is restricting the Asian Journal's circulation to 400 copies a day. 
The newspaper's sales to the republic totaled 5,000 copies before the restrictions. 

   In the U.S., a Time Inc. spokesman said: "We welcome the decision by the Singapore government to rescind the restrictions against Time magazine that unfortunately have been in effect since October 1986." 

   A Dow Jones spokesman said: "We're always delighted when a ban against any member of the press is lifted. 
We look forward to the day when The Asian Wall Street Journal also is once again freely circulating in Singapore."
