<HEAD>Wall Street Journal Plans to Halt Circulation of Asian Paper in
Singapore</HEAD>

   The owners of the Wall Street Journal announced
Monday they will halt the circulation of the Asian Wall Street
Journal in Singapore, following the publication of new restrictions
on the foreign press there.
   ``What the government of Singapore wants is for the foreign
press to practice self-censorship,'' Dow Jones &amp; Co., the majority
owner of the Asian Wall Street Journal, said in an editorial. ``A
facade of factual reporting will be allowed, but any statement by
authorities must be taken at face value.''
   The editorial, published in Monday's editions of the Asian
Journal, the Wall Street Journal in the United States and the Wall
Street Journal Europe, also accused Time Warner Inc.'s Asiaweek of
cooperating with Singapore's regulations. Asiaweek recently
published a positive cover story on retiring Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew.
   Asiaweek's editor Michael O'Neil said the editorial was
``factually incorrect'' and that the story on Lee was not ``too
soft.'' He declined to comment further.
   Lee, in a speech Monday in Hong Kong to the Commonwealth Press
Union, said the Journal's decision was of little consequence.
   Dow Jones' decision is the latest in a long-running battle
between its two Asian publications, the Asian Wall Street Journal
and the Far Eastern Economic Review, and the Singapore government.
   In 1987, Singapore restricted the circulation of the Asian
Journal from 5,000 copies to 400 after the Journal ran a story
about Singapore's efforts to start a second stock market. The
government criticized the story in a 1,500 word letter that the
Journal refused to print in full.
   Singapore also limited the Review to 400 copies for reporting on
the government's treatment of the political opposition and other
sensitive topics.
   When the Review halted its circulation in Singapore, the
government altered its copyright laws to allow a local printing
house to reprint copies of the Review and sell them in Singapore.
   It was not immediately known whether Singapore would also allow
printing houses to do the same with the Journal.
   Dow Jones' decision follows the passing of new regulations by
Singapore's parliament on Aug. 30. Under the regulations, foreign
publications are required to obtain an annual distribution permit
if they distribute more than 300 copies in Singapore and if they
carry articles on politics and current affairs on ``any country in
Southeast Asia.''
   The new regulations also require such foreign publications to
post an unspecified security deposit that can be put toward any
legal liabilities or court costs the publications might face in
Singapore.
   ``What worries us here is not any one provision,'' Dow Jones
said in its editorial. ``What worries us is the purpose to which,
five years of experience warns us, these powers will be put.''
