   Here is a chronology of key dates and
developments in the 100-year history of The Wall Street Journal, as
supplied by the newspaper:
   1882 _ Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones, two newspapermen from
New England, form a financial news agency in New York. They are
joined by a third partner, Charles Bergstresser, who is persuaded to
become a ``silent partner'' because Dow Jones &amp; Bergstresser didn't
sound right.
   1883 _ Dow Jones &amp; Co. begins publishing The Customers' Afternoon
Letter, a precursor to The Wall Street Journal.
   July 8, 1889 _ The first edition of The Wall Street Journal, a
four-page afternoon newspaper selling for two cents a copy, is
published. Charles Dow is the first editor and the paper features
his innovative ``average'' of 11 stocks.
   1898 _ A morning Journal edition is added. Circulation will
exceed 10,000 by the end of the century.
   1902 _ Clarence W. Barron, a financial journalist and publisher,
purchases Dow Jones &amp; Co.
   1929 _ Twenty-year-old Bernard Kilgore is hired as a Journal copy
editor. He goes on to become a reporter, Washington correspondent,
political columnist, managing editor, general manager, president of
Dow Jones at age 36, and later chairman. Kilgore is considered
responsible for transforming the Journal from a small financial
newspaper into the country's first national daily.
   1929 _ The Journal's Pacific Coast edition begins publication in
San Francisco and Los Angeles, a week before the stock market crash.
In the ensuing Depression, the Journal's circulation slips from
50,000 to 28,000.
   1934 _ The evening edition is discontinued.
   1941 _ Kilgore is named managing editor. He shapes the paper's
present-day approach that business news should go beyond financial
information to cover everything related to earning a living,
including trends and issues that shape society.
   Dec. 8, 1941 _ The day after Japan bombs Pearl Harbor, the paper
runs its first and only page-wide banner, three-deck headline and
reports extensively on how the ensuing war would affect American
industry.
   1947 _ Journal circulation reaches 100,000. Warren H. Phillips,
current chairman of Dow Jones, is hired as a copyreader.
   1948 _ Southwest edition is established.
   1951 _ Midwest edition is established.
   1953 _ The Journal's Saturday paper is discontinued. The same
year the Journal introduces its Electro-Typesetter, allowing typeset
stories to be sent over telephone lines to Journal plants in Dallas,
Chicago and San Francisco, eliminating retypesetting at the
satellite plants.
   1962 _ The Journal plant in Riverside, Calif., produces the
nation's first regularly and commercially printed facsimile
newspaper, using a microwave transmission from the San Francisco
plant.
   1966 _ Paid circulation surpasses 1 million.
   1974 _ A page of the Journal is transmitted from a makeshift
earth station in Chicopee, Mass., to South Brunswick, N.J., via a
satellite, a first for any U.S. newspaper. Also that year, selected
Journal stories are published electronically by Dow Jones
News-Retrieval.
   1975 _ An entire issue of the Journal sent by satellite to
Orlando, Fla., from Chicopee. The Journal's Orlando plant is the
world's first to operate exclusively via a satellite link.
   1976 _ The Asian Wall Street Journal is established in Hong Kong.
   1980 _ The Journal begins publishing in two sections.
   1981 _ Circulation surpasses 2 million.
