   A group of investors, including publishers Groupe L'Expansion of France and Dow Jones &amp; Co., is preparing to purchase a combined 50% stake in the publisher of Cinco Dias, a Spanish financial newspaper. 

   Under the proposed agreement, Groupe L'Expansion has bought a 30% interest in Estructura S.A. of Madrid, the Spanish newspaper's owner. 
Dow Jones, which holds a 14.5% stake in Groupe L'Expansion, intends to buy as much as a 10% interest, while two French banks, Banque Indosuez and Societe Lyonnaise de Banque, would each have a 5% stake in the Spanish concern. 
The value of the proposed transaction wasn't disclosed. 

   Cinco Dias is a daily with circulation of about 21,000 nationwide. 
Estructura also publishes the business news magazine, Mercado; a business newsletter, and an agricultural monthly called Tria. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, The Asian Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, newswires, community newspapers and a computerized news-retrieval service. 
It also holds a 56% interest in Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
