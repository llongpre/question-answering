   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said first-quarter net income rose 55% to $103.6 million, or $1.08 a share, aided by a one-time gain. 

   Operating income for the first quarter rose 54% to $91.1 million from $59.1 million, reflecting contributions from 56%-owned Telerate Inc. and continued growth of Dow Jones's electronic information services and community newspapers. 
However, operating income and revenue from the business publications segment, which includes The Wall Street Journal, declined. 
The latest quarter included a gain of $64.5 million, or 67 cents a share, from the sale of the Richard D. Irwin Inc. book publishing subsidiary. 

   A year earlier, Dow Jones had net income of $66.7 million, or 69 cents a share, including an after-tax gain of $29.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from the sale of a 19% interest in South China Morning Post Ltd. 

   Excluding the one-time gains, earnings for the first quarter rose 4.8% to $39.2 million, or 41 cents a share, from $37.4 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue increased 38% to $392.5 million from $285.6 million. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Dow Jones shares fell 87.5 cents to close at $31.125 a share. 
Telerate shares on the exchange closed at $19.50 a share, up 37.5 cents. 

   The 1988 first-quarter results include those of Telerate on a consolidated basis, while the 1987 first quarter reflected Telerate's results through the equity method of accounting. 

   Dow Jones said operating income -- earnings before taxes, interest and other income -- for business publications fell 23% in the quarter, to $32.6 million. 
Business publications also include the Journal's overseas editions, Barron's magazine, the Far Eastern Economic Review, and other publications. 
In 1987, the segment's results included those of the Irwin book publishing unit. 
Revenue declined 4.6% to $192.1 million from $201.5 million. 
The declines reflected lower levels of financial advertising, a consequence of last fall's stock market crash, the company said. 

   In the information services segment, which includes Telerate, operating income rose 293% to $54.3 million from $13.8 million, while revenue rose 302% to $147.7 million from $36.8 million. 
Dow Jones information services, which excludes Telerate, and which operates financial and business news wires and computerized information retrieval services, had a revenue gain of 20% and an operating income increase of 31%. 

   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., which operates community newspapers, had a 3.7% gain in operating income, to $8.5 million, while revenue rose 12% to $52.7 million. 
Advertising linage rose 5.4% for the quarter. 

   Wall Street Journal advertising linage fell 8.6% in the quarter, or 10% an issue. 
Sharp downturns in financial advertising more than offset gains in general advertising. 
Linage at Barron's declined 10.3% during the quarter. 

   Separately, Telerate reported a 53% increase in net income for the first quarter, to $23.7 million, or 25 cents a share, from $15.5 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 44% to $104.6 million from $72.8 million. 
Per-share earnings reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in October 1987. 

   Neil S. Hirsch, president and chief executive officer, said he expects "continued growth for Telerate" in 1988 despite the October market collapse. 
He said Telerate, a financial information network, is "strong in most of Asia, moving forward very well in continental Europe, and showing resilience in the United States and the United Kingdom, where there has been some industry retrenchment."
