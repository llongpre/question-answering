   Dow Jones &amp; Co. and National Broadcasting Co. signed an agreement for NBC News to begin producing a new 15-minute early morning business program in association with The Wall Street Journal. 

   The television show, entitled "Before Hours," will consist of business and financial news and features based on articles appearing in each day's Wall Street Journal, plus other stories gathered by NBC News and the program's own news staff. 
It will also include live interviews with business leaders and commentators, including Journal editors and reporters. 
The program will also feature special weather reports for the business traveler and a segment on personal finance. 

   The Monday-Friday program, to begin March 2, will be distributed by NBC each morning to its owned and operated stations and affiliates and will run prior to NBC News's "Today" show and, in some markets, either before or after the network's "Sunrise" program. 

   The show's executive producer will be Gerry Solomon, who will continue as executive producer of the "Sunrise" show. 
"Before Hours" will be anchored by NBC newsman Bob Jamieson and will be prepared and edited in consultation with a number of senior Journal editors, including Stewart Pinkerton, deputy managing editor; Nancy Cardwell, assistant managing editor, and Michael J. Connor, recently named the newspaper's director of television news. 

   In addition to The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones publishes The Asian Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, Barron's magazine, community newspapers and textbooks, and operates business news services. 
Dow Jones also produces a weekly syndicated television business show entitled "The Wall Street Journal Report on Television." 
NBC is a unit of General Electric Co.
