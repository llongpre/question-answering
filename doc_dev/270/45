   Dow Jones &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. today agreed to develop jointly a new series of global equity-market indexes. 

   The indexes will track stocks in all the world's major stock markets on a continuing basis. 
Dow Jones and Shearson will use the indexes to compile the Dow Jones World Index, a comprehensive measure of world stock-market performance. 

   Dow Jones expects to begin publishing the Dow Jones World Index in The Wall Street Journal, The Asian Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, Barron's, Dow Jones newswires and other Dow Jones publications and services early next year. 
The company also will publish country, regional or other components of the index as news developments warrant. 

   Shearson plans to make available to its clients the information used in compiling the indexes, along with its own related analysis. 

   "Our data and accompanying analysis will provide investors with insight into how the international-equity markets are responding to each other, as well as to domestic economic developments," said Herbert S. Freiman, vice chairman and director of Shearson's Capital Markets Division. 

   "As the Dow Jones Industrial Average serves as a bellwether for the U.S. stock market, so will the Dow Jones World Index for global markets," said Norman Pearlstine, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal. 

   Development, compilation and maintenance of the indexes will be supervised by a committee of representatives from Dow Jones and Shearson, a unit of American Express Co.
