   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, introduced a new newswire for active stock market investors. 

   The Dow Jones Professional Investor Report transmits an immediate alert, on video display terminals or via teleprinters, when there is an unusual price or volume move in any of the 5,400 common stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the National Market System portion of the over-the-counter market. 
Reporters will provide subscribers with further information about the most significant alerts. 

   The new service is intended as a companion product to the Dow Jones News Service, the company's oldest and largest newswire, which will "continue its historic role of promptly reporting corporate and economic news," said William L. Dunn, executive vice president of Dow Jones and president of its information services group. 

   In addition to the Journal and newswires, Dow Jones publishes Asian and European editions of The Wall Street Journal, data-base retrieval services, Barron's, Ottaway community newspapers and Richard D. Irwin textbooks.
