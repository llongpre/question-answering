   Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc., proprietor of The Asian Wall Street Journal, filed a motion in the Singapore High Court for leave to quash a government order restricting the paper's circulation to 400 copies a day. 
The court set the hearing for May 22. 

   The order, issued Feb. 9 by the minister of communications and information, declared the Asian Journal to be "a newspaper engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore." 
The minister cut the paper's sales in the republic to 400 from 5,000. 

   In a statement filed with the court yesterday, Dow Jones (Asia) says the minister has publicly admitted that he issued the order to punish the editor of the Asian Journal for his refusal to publish a letter of complaint from a Singapore government official. 
An editor's decision not to publish a letter from a civil servant cannot be said to be an engagement by his newspaper in domestic politics, the statement says. 

   Dow Jones (Asia) seeks to annul the order on grounds that it was made unlawfully, irregularly and irrationally and pursuant to statutory amendments that contravene the Singapore Constitution's guarantee of "freedom of expression." 

   Dow Jones (Asia), which is 80%-owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of the U.S., is the second publication to have its circulation in Singapore curbed under an amended Newspaper and Printing Presses Act passed by Singapore's Parliament last August. 
Time magazine's weekly circulation was cut in two phases to 2,000 from 18,000.
