   The Wall Street Journal plans to introduce later this year a number of changes in the organization and display of news and statistics, Warren H. Phillips, chairman of Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Journal, told the annual meeting. 

   Coverage of market trends and investment opportunities will be broadened and organized in a separate third section beginning in September, Mr. Phillips said. 
These and other changes are all designed "to provide readers with more useful information without the need to expend more time," the Dow Jones chairman said. 

   In addition to improving news and statistical coverage of markets, the Journal will better organize and display its coverage of several fields, including technology. 
These changes are "evolutionary" and follow other recent improvements in news presentation, Mr. Phillips said. 
Last year, for example, the Journal introduced a daily index of businesses. 
Earlier this year, it began grouping its marketing and media coverage on a dedicated page. 

   The post-Oct. 19 retrenchment in the investment community won't slow company plans "for continuing this year to improve the quality and usefulness of the Journal and our other publications and services," the Dow Jones executive said. 

   Mr. Phillips also said that later this year, Dow Jones News/Retrieval, the company's electronic information service, will begin using parallel-processing computer techniques and artificial-intelligence technology. 
This new technology will allow customers to retrieve information with simple English-language commands. 

   Financial advertising to the investment community is off significantly, Mr. Phillips told the meeting, resulting in a previously reported 8.6% decline in total advertising linage at the Journal in the first quarter and a 10.3% decline at Barron's. 
New-circulation sales at both publications also are being hurt, leading to "modest circulation declines in recent months," he said. 

   Besides the Journal and Barron's, Dow Jones publishes other periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers. 
It also owns 56% of Telerate Inc., which provides computerized financial information on global markets.
