   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it expects third-quarter earnings will be below those of a year earlier. 

   The outlook reflects a decline in advertising revenue, the company said. 
Financial advertising particularly has been running well below year-earlier levels in the aftermath of last October's stock market crash. 

   In the year-earlier third quarter, net income totaled $36.8 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $298.6 million. 

   Continuing strong gains at Dow Jones's Information Services Group, which includes the consolidated results of 56%-owned Telerate Inc., won't be sufficient to offset a large decline in operating earnings at the Business Publications Group and a decline in profit at the Ottaway Community Newspapers Group in the third quarter, the company said. 

   Wall Street Journal advertising linage in July was 22% below a year earlier (10.3% on a per-issue basis) and down 8% in August (16% per issue). 
The Journal published three fewer days in July this year than last, and two more days this year in August than last year. 
Barron's advertising was off 15.9% in July and 27% in August. 

   A Dow Jones spokesman said the decline in advertising revenue in the normally light-volume summer months had a disproportionate impact on the business publications' operating earnings, given the relatively steady level of costs throughout the year. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dow Jones shares closed at $33.75, down $1.625. 

   In addition to The Wall Street Journal and Barron's, Dow Jones publishes computerized information services, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal, domestic and international newswires, and radio and television reports, and the Ottaway community newspapers.
