   In a significant realignment of regional publishing interests, News Corp. of Australia headed by Rupert Murdoch, and Dow Jones &amp; Co. set in motion a series of transactions involving three Asian publications. 

   If concluded, the transactions would enable New York-based Dow Jones to gain complete ownership of the Far Eastern Economic Review and tighten control over The Asian Wall Street Journal, both regional business publications based in Hong Kong. 
News Corp. would increase its control over South China Morning Post Ltd., publisher of Hong Kong's dominant English-language newspaper. 

   The initial transaction involves the Post. 
Dow Jones said Wednesday it intends to sell to News Corp. its 18.9% stake in the local publishing concern for HK$73 a share, or about HK$446 million, the equivalent of $57.2 million (U.S.). 
News Corp. already owns 34.9% of the Post. 
In compliance with local regulations, News Corp. said it will make an offer of not less than HK$73 a share to other Post shareholders after it buys Dow Jones's holding. 
News Corp. said the transaction with Dow Jones is to be completed by Monday. 

   The Post transaction is conditional upon an agreement involving the other two publications. 
Dow Jones is to buy all of the Post's interests in the Review for $25.1 million (U.S.), and in the Asian Journal for $2.1 million (U.S.). 

   The Review is 51%-held by the Post and 49% by Dow Jones. 
The Asian Journal is 12.7%-held by the Post, 67% by Dow Jones, and the rest by others. 
If either disposal doesn't occur by March 31, Dow Jones would have the right to rescind its sale of the Post stake. 

   Dow Jones executives said their ultimate goal in these transactions is to gain control of the Review. 
Such a move would add significant strength to the U.S. concern's presence in the region. 
The Asian Journal, published in a format similar to sister editions in the U.S. and Europe, has a daily circulation of more than 32,000. 
The Review, a weekly magazine, has almost double the circulation of the Asian Journal. 

   The transactions would put Dow Jones "in a position it wanted to be in for some time, which is control of two premier regional publications in Asia," said Peter Kann, Dow Jones international group president. 

   Derek Davies, editor of the Review, welcomed the proposed takeover. 
Referring to support that his magazine has received from the U.S. concern in circulation and advertising sales, he said, "We would still be operating on a shoestring if Dow Jones hadn't become involved." 

   Dow Jones has held a minority stake in the Review since the early 1970s. 
The opportunity to gain control didn't arrive until last month. 
That was when Mr. Murdoch, the international media baron, bought a 34.9% Post stake through News Corp. from two other shareholders and indicated that the company intended to increase the holding further. 

   That development apparently was all the opening that Dow Jones needed. 
Under an existing option agreement, Dow Jones has the right to buy all of the Review if majority control -- or more than 50% -- of the Post changes hands. 
By agreeing to sell its 18.9% holding, Dow Jones would help push News Corp.'s holding in the Post well past the point at which the Review option would come into force. 

   In New York, Peter G. Skinner, vice president and corporate general counsel of Dow Jones, said the agreement between Dow Jones and the Murdoch interests will trigger the earlier agreement and thus will result in Dow Jones's acquiring 100% of the Review. 

   Mr. Kann declined to say which party made the initial overtures. 
"It's hard to say who made the first phone call," he said. 
"But certainly Dow Jones has been interested for some time in acquiring a majority of the Review -- even before Mr. Murdoch came along." 

   Kenneth L. Burenga, senior vice president and chief financial and administrative officer of Dow Jones, said Dow Jones expects to record a capital gain of about $29 million, or 30 cents a share, from the sale of its interest in South China Morning Post. 
He said the gain will be reported either in the 1986 fourth quarter or in 1987, depending on when all transactions are completed. 
The Post shares have been acquired over the past 10 years at considerably less than News Corp.'s HK$73-a-share offer -- some of them for as little as HK$15 a share in 1975. 

   For News Corp., whose main goal appears to be acquisition of a majority stake in the Post, the transactions with Dow Jones would enable the purchase to be completed at a lower-than-expected cost. 

   News Corp. bought its existing 34.9% Post stake from Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. for HK$73 a share. 
At the time, News Corp. took an option to buy from those two shareholders a further 15.1% Post stake for between HK$73 and HK$80 a share. 
Since all shareholders would be entitled to equally favorable terms in a general offer, News Corp. could have to pay as much as HK$1.68 billion for the remaining 65.1% Post stake if the option is exercised at HK$80 a share. 

   But by going to Dow Jones -- the only shareholder besides Hongkong Bank and Hutchison that can deliver a major block of shares -- and paying only HK$73 a share, News Corp. could save as much as HK$147 million in acquiring the 65.1% stake. 

   The agreement between Dow Jones and News Corp. was first disclosed by Dow Jones in Hong Kong in the afternoon. 
News Corp. followed late in the evening with its own announcement. 
This second announcement, made through News Corp.'s merchant bank adviser, Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd., provided considerably more detail on the conditions attached to the transactions and the prices involved. 

   The Post didn't comment on the transactions. 
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, which still holds a 25.8% Post stake, said it will consider the terms of any general offer for the shares of the concern. 
Officials of Hutchison, which still owns 13.5% of the Post, weren't available for comment. 

   News Corp. emphasized that its option with Hongkong Bank and Hutchison remains in effect until tomorrow. 

   The transaction involving the Asian Journal appears to be a minor feature in the overall package. 
When setting up the newspaper 10 years ago, Dow Jones swapped minority interests in it with several publishing concerns in the region. 
The idea was that the local connections might help Dow Jones establish the newspaper in unfamiliar territory. 

   To a great extent, these connections have paid off. 
Especially in Hong Kong, where the Asian Journal is based, the Post has helped considerably with the regional newspaper's printing and circulation. 
But since Dow Jones expanded its Hong Kong operations two years ago and began printing its own newspapers, the importance of the connection between the Asian Journal and the Post has diminished. 
In fact, occasional conflicts have arisen between the Asian Journal and the Post over various printing contracts. 

   In an unrelated move two months ago, Dow Jones traded to the New Straits Times group Dow Jones's holding in that Malaysian publishing company in return for the Malaysian group's 6.75% share in the Asian Journal. 

   The effect of this exchange, when combined with the proposed Post transaction, is that Dow Jones will own about 80% of the Asian Journal. 
The rest is held by the Straits Times of Singapore and Nihon Keizai Shimbun of Japan.
