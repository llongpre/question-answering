<HEAD>Dow Jones Posts Big Rise in 1st-Qtr Profit with One-Time Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said Monday its profit nearly
doubled from a year ago because of a big one-time gain from the
sale of a cable television investment, but weakness in financial
advertising drove its operating income down by 12.5 percent.
   Dow Jones said its profit rose to $200 million, or $1.99 a
share, in the first three months of the year from $103.6 million,
or $1.08 per share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 3.6 percent to $406.8 million from
$392.5 million a year earlier.
   The latest results included an after-tax gain of $164.1 million
from the sale in January of the company's 17 percent stake in
Continental Cablevision Inc., a cable system operator. The 1988
results included a gain of $64.4 million from the sale of a
book-publishing subsidiary, Richard D. Irwin Inc.
   Excluding those one-time gains, DowJones said its earnings fell
8.4 percent to $35.9 million from $39.2 million a year earlier.
   Dow Jones said its operating income, or earnings before taxes,
interest and other income, fell 12.5 percent to $79.8 million from
$91.1 million.
   The decline was blamed mainly on continuing weakness in
financial advertising at the Wall Street Journal, its flagship
publication.
   Revenue at the business publications segment fell 4.8 percent to
$182.9 million and operating income fell 33.1 percent to $21.8
million, the company said.
   That segment includes results from the Wall Street Journal,
Barron's, the Far Eastern Economic Review and other publications.
   Dow Jones said its information services segment had a 14.5
percent increase in revenue to $169.1 million while operating
income rose 0.6 percent to $54.6 million. That includes results
from Telerate Inc., in which Dow Jones owns a 67 percent stake.
   Excluding Telerate's results, Dow Jones said the information
services group consisting of Dow Jones News Service, Dow Jones-News
Retrieval and other newswire and electronic services, reported a
7.6 percent rise in revenue and a 6.1 pecent increase in operating
income.
   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspapers segment of Dow
Jones, had operating income of $7.4 million, down 13.6 percent, and
revenue of $54.8 million, up 3.9 percent.
