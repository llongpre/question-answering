DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, yesterday reported a 58 per
cent rise in first-quarter net income as advertising lineage at the
newspaper rebounded from the depressed level of 1991.
Dow Jones reported income of Dollars 28.39m, or 28 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 17.96m, or 18 cents, in the first quarter of last year.
Revenues rose nearly 5 per cent to Dollars 436m. The profit figures were
towards the top end of Wall Street expectations.
The Wall Street Journal has been helped over the past two quarters by
advertising for the flood of new securities issues in the US market.
Corporate advertising, hit hard by the recession, still appears to be
relatively soft, say brokers' analysts.
The company itself attributed its improved performance to higher advertising
lineage at the Journal, lower interest expense and improved earnings at
Telerate, its electronic financial information service, and at its Ottaway
community newspapers.
Operating income at its business publishing segment rose from Dollars 9.68m
to Dollars 24.62m on revenues 8 per cent higher at Dollars 186m. Advertising
lineage at the Journal rose 9.2 per cent relative to the first quarter of
last year.
There was one additional publishing day this year, and on a per-issue basis
lineage rose 7.5 per cent.
The company's information services segment - which includes Telerate -
produced operating income of Dollars 40.26m, compared with Dollars 38.52m,
on revenues 2.2 per cent higher at Dollars 196.25m.
Ottaway Newspapers saw a rise in profits from Dollars 2.7m to Dollars 4.14m,
while revenues rose 2.6 per cent to Dollars 53.23m.
However, advertising lineage at its daily newspapers fell 5.5 per cent.
