   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. reported a 28% decline in net
income for the first quarter, to $18 million, or 18 cents a
share, from $24.9 million, or 25 cents a share, in the
year-earlier quarter.
   The company attributed the decline largely to reduced
advertising at The Wall Street Journal and lower profit at
Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspapers subsidiary.

   Peter R. Kann, president and chief executive officer, said
the results "reflected the effects of the national economic
slowdown and of advertising retrenchment during the Persian
Gulf war -- conditions faced by most newspaper and magazine
publishers around the country."
   Revenue for the period declined 2.4% to $416.6 million.
   The company's consolidated operating income was off 25% to
$46.8 million. Its information services segment, which
includes Telerate Inc. and the Dow Jones Information Services
Group, reported a 4.4% increase in revenue to $192.4 million
and a 6.8% rise in operating income to $38.2 million. Mr.
Kann said strong results in Telerate's overseas operations
partly offset the slump in ad linage for publications.
   Dow Jones's other two segments reported declines. Business
publications, including The Wall Street Journal and Barron's
magazine, showed a 62% drop in operating income to $10
million, and revenue declined 9% to $172.3 million.
Advertising linage was down 21% at the Journal, or 20% on a
per-issue basis; there was one less issue than in the 1990
quarter. Linage at Barron's was off 14%, or 7% on a per-issue
basis for the weekly.
   Community newspapers operating income was down 40% to $2.7
million, on a 2.8% revenue decline to $51.9 million. Several
of the larger Ottaway newspapers are in New England, which
has been hit hard by recession.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Dow Jones shares closed at $25.375, up 12.5 cents.
