   The Singapore government slashed Asiaweek's circulation in the republic by 94% in a dispute that followed publication of an article on the detention of suspected leftists. 

   The Hong Kong-based magazine's circulation in Singapore will be cut to 500 copies a week from about 8,000, effective Sunday. 
Asiaweek says its total circulation is close to 70,000. 
In Hong Kong, the magazine's editor in chief, Michael O'Neill, described the circulation cut as baffling. 
He declined further comment until he has read the government's statement on the cut. 
In New York, a spokesman for Time Inc., which has an 84% stake in Asiaweek, said Time hadn't been informed by Singapore of the move, but "if served papers, we will urgently appeal." 

   Asiaweek hasn't given its version of the dispute, but Singapore released a press statement Wednesday saying it arose over a Sept. 13 article dealing with the arrest and detention of 22 young Singaporeans who were accused of involvement in a Marxist plot to subvert the republic. 
The government, which disputes various elements of the story, accused the magazine of not printing two letters to the editor in response to the article and of altering a letter it did print. 

   Time magazine and The Asian Wall Street Journal both had their circulation in Singapore slashed after similar disputes over publication of letters from the government about articles they had printed. 
Time later printed a government letter and the magazine's circulation was reinstated several months later. 
The Hong Kong-based Asian Wall Street Journal and its parent company, Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc., are challenging the circulation restriction on the newspaper, which is still in force, in Singapore's courts.
