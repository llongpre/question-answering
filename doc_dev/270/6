   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it completed the previously announced purchase of 51% of the stock of Far Eastern Economic Review Ltd. from South China Morning Post Ltd. for $25.1 million, making Far Eastern Economic Review a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Jones. 

   As part of the agreement, South China Morning Post sold to Dow Jones for $2.1 million its interest in Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc., publisher of The Asian Wall Street Journal. 

   Based in Hong Kong, the Far Eastern Economic Review is Asia's leading English-language business and economic news weekly. 
Circulation exceeds 64,000 compared with 17,000 when Dow Jones acquired its original interest in 1974. 
The 40-year-old publication has 57 editors, reporters and correspondents in a dozen Asian and other locations. 

   "We are proud of our 13-year association with the Review and we look forward to participating even more actively in its bright future," said Peter Kann, associate publisher of The Wall Street Journal and president of Dow Jones's Magazine and International Groups. 
"We value the Review highly for many reasons, but above all for its 40-year tradition of journalistic enterprise, integrity and courage. 
All of us at Dow Jones are committed to upholding those traditions and standards." 

   In addition to The Wall Street Journal and The Asian Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, domestic and overseas newswires, the Dow Jones News/Retrieval computerized information service and radio and television news reports.
