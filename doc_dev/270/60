   Dow Jones &amp; Co., New York, signed a syndication agreement with Conus Communications L.P. for Conus to join Wall Street Journal Television in marketing a new business news service to domestic commercial television stations. 

   The service includes a daily summary of major market, business and economic events, fed by satellite each afternoon. 

   According to Michael Connor, director of television news for The Wall Street Journal, local stations will also be able to ask the Journal's television news desk "for help in putting a national perspective on a local business story." 

   In addition, Journal employees will be available to analyze events in live two-way interviews with the local stations, using Conus's satellite facilities, Mr. Connor said. 

   Minneapolis-based Conus's managing partner is Hubbard Broadcasting Inc. 
It operates a daily news exchange for U.S. television stations and provides satellite news gathering facilities. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine and other periodicals, electronic business information services and the Ottaway community newspapers. 
It also owns 56% of Telerate Inc., which provides computerized financial information on global markets.
