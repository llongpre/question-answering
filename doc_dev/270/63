   Dow Jones &amp; Co. reported slightly higher net income for the second quarter on increased revenue, although its business-publications segment reported lower revenue and operating income. 

   For the second quarter, profit was $49.5 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $49.1 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 32% to $413.8 million from $313.1 million, largely reflecting consolidation of the financial results of 56%-owned Telerate Inc. with Dow Jones results. 

   Operating income, or earnings from operations before taxes, interest and other income, rose 28% in the quarter to $101.8 million, reflecting contributions from Telerate and continued growth of Dow Jones's electronic information services. 

   Operating income from business publications, which include The Wall Street Journal and its overseas editions, Barron's magazine, the Far Eastern Economic Review and other publications, declined 31% to $38.4 million from $55.8 million; revenue fell 8.2% to $201 million from $218.9 million. 

   The business-publications figures resulted in part from decreased financial advertising following last fall's stock market crash. 
Wall Street Journal advertising linage declined almost 12% in the quarter, while circulation at June 30 was down approximately 5% from a year earlier. 
Barron's linage fell 11% in the quarter. 

   Operating income of Information Services, which includes Telerate's results in the 1988 periods, jumped to $54.9 million from $14.8 million a year earlier, while revenue rose to $152.8 million from $38.4 million. 
Excluding Telerate, Dow Jones Information Services, which operates financial and business news wires and computerized information-retrieval services, had a 23% operating income increase on a 15% revenue gain. 

   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspapers segment, had a 10% decline in operating income, to $12.9 million from $14.3 million, while revenue rose 7.7% to $60.1 million from $55.8 million. 

   For the six months, Dow Jones profit rose 32% to $153.1 million, or $1.59 a share, from the year-earlier $115.8 million, or $1.20 a share. 
The latest first half includes an after-tax gain of $64.5 million, or 67 cents a share, from the February 1988 sale of the Richard D. Irwin Inc. book-publishing subsidiary. 
A year earlier, Dow Jones had a $29.4 million, or 30-cent-a-share, gain from sale of its interest in South China Morning Post Ltd. Revenue rose 35% to $806.4 million from $598.6 million. 

   Excluding gains from those transactions, earnings for the first six months were $88.6 million, or 92 cents a share, up 2.5% from $86.5 million, or 89 cents a share. 

   Operating income rose 39% in the first half. 
The 1987 first quarter and first-half results reflect Telerate's contribution through the equity method of accounting; since Oct. 1, 1987, Dow Jones had consolidated Telerate's results with its own for financial reporting purposes. 

   Dow Jones stock rose 75 cents to close at $34.375 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 

   Telerate
   Telerate said second-quarter earnings rose 35% to $23.3 million, or 25 cents a share, from $17.3 million, or 18 cents a share. 
Revenue rose 37% to $109.4 million from $79.8 million. 

   In the first half, earnings rose 43% to $47 million, or 50 cents a share, from $32.8 million, or 35 cents a share. 
Revenue rose 40% to $214 million from $152.6 million. 

   The company said that while the quarter and six months showed healthy increases, this year has been more difficult than prior years because of the effect of last October's market crash. 
"Considering the circumstances, however, our business is proving to be resilient, and we already see a renewed acceleration of revenues," said Neil Hirsch, president and chief executive officer. 

   Telerate said equity interests, mostly from start-up costs of a trading service venture with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and foreign-exchange translation losses, reduced income by $1 million. 

   Telerate stock fell 25 cents to close at $16.625 a share in Big Board composite trading yesterday.
