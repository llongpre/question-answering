   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. and the magazine division of
Hearst Corp. announced plans to test a magazine called
SmartMoney, The Wall Street Journal Magazine of Personal
Business.
   The joint-venture partners said they plan to publish a
test issue of the personal-business magazine, to be produced
by the editors and reporters of The Wall Street Journal, for
nationwide newsstand sale beginning March 2, 1992.

   The two companies said 400,000 copies of the test issue
will be produced and that scheduling and circulation of
subsequent issues will depend on the results of the test.
   Norman Pearlstine, executive editor of The Wall Street
Journal, and John Mack Carter, director of magazine
development for Hearst Magazines and editor in chief of its
Good Housekeeping magazine, are supervising development of
the new publication.
   "While this is only a test, we're very excited about the
potential for a sophisticated and entertaining publication
dealing with personal investing, spending and saving," Mr.
Pearlstine said.
   Mr. Carter said that Hearst Magazines has successfully
launched a number of magazines in recent years, including
Country Living, Victoria and Countryside. "In the case of
SmartMoney," Mr. Carter said, "we enjoy the opportunity to
add this experience to The Wall Street Journal's expertise in
financial and investment journalism. It is a powerful
combination."
   In addition to the domestic and international editions of
The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's
magazine and other publications, newswires and electronic
information services, and community newspapers.
   Hearst Magazines, the world's largest publisher of monthly
magazines, publishes 14 major consumer magazines in the U.S.
and operates two magazine distribution and two subscription
fulfillment companies.
