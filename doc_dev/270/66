   HONG KONG -- The Asian Wall Street Journal has applied to
resume circulating in Singapore.
   Lawyers representing New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
majority owner of the Asian Journal, filed an application on
Monday with the Singaporean government. "We are hopeful the
application will be acted upon favorably," a company
spokesman said.

   The government cut the daily business paper's circulation
in Singapore to 400 copies a day from 5,000 in February 1987
after accusing the Asian Journal of interfering in domestic
politics. Dow Jones withdrew the remaining circulation last
October when Singapore prepared to adopt new rules on the
domestic distribution of overseas publications.
   In addition to the Asian Journal, Dow Jones owns The Wall
Street Journal and The Wall Street Journal Europe. The global
Journal has a circulation of two million. Dow Jones also owns
the weekly Far Eastern Economic Review, which remains
restricted in Singapore.
