<HEAD>Dow Jones Posts Sharp Decline in First-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Monday its
first-quarter profit fell 87.6 percent from a year earlier, when
its results included a huge one-time gain on the sale of its
investment in a cable-system operator.
   Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and Barron's
magazine, said it earned $24.9 million, or 25 cents a share, in the
three months ended March 31 compared with $200 million, or $1.99 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 5 percent to $427.1 million from $406.8 million in
1989.
   The 1989 results included an after-tax gain of $164.1 million,
or $1.63 a share, on the cable investment sale. Excluding the gain,
its net income was down 30.6 percent in the latest quarter.
Operating income fell 22.2 percent.
   The company said income from its business publications rose 20.2
percent, but that its income fell 34.6 percent from information
services, mainly because of losses associated with the introduction
of a foreign-exchange trading service by its Telerate Inc.
subsidiary.
   The trading service had not been in operation in the first
quarter of 1989.
   The latest results were also hurt by a decline in operating
income at the community newspaper segment, a higher effective tax
rate and increased interest expense and goodwill amortization
related to Dow Jones' January acquisition of the one-third stake in
Telerate that it did not already own.
   Revenue rose 9 percent to $184.3 million at the information
services segment, which includes Telerate, Dow Jones News Service
and Dow Jones News-Retrieval service. But operating income fell to
$35.8 million from $54.6 million.
   Revenue rose 3.5 percent to $189.3 million at the business
publications, while operating income rose to $26.2 million from
$21.9 million.
   Advertising linage fell 3.9 percent at The Wall Street Journal,
while it rose 2.1 percent at the weekly Barron's.
   Revenue fell 2.5 percent to $53.4 million at Ottaway Newspapers
Inc. while operating income at the community newspaper segment fell
39.3 percent to $4.5 million.
