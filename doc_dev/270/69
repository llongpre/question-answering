   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it plans to launch a
Classroom Edition of The Wall Street Journal, which it said
would be aimed at improving the economic and business
literacy of high-school students.
   The 24-page, four-color newspaper will be published
monthly during the school year, starting in September.
Circulation in the first academic year is expected to average
70,000 students and 2,400 teachers.

   The newspaper's editorial content will consist almost
entirely of articles from The Wall Street Journal, with
stories and layouts tailored to teachers' needs and students'
interests. Based on surveys, "students want real articles
from the real newspaper," said Melinda Grenier Guiles, editor
and publisher of The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition.
   The newspaper will cost $90 a semester for a class of 30,
or $3 a student each semester. The program also includes a
monthly teacher's guide, video supplements and other
educational resources.
   Dow Jones also publishes Barron's magazine, other
periodicals and community newspapers, and operates an
information-services unit.
