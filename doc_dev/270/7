   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said earnings for the third quarter increased 11% from a year earlier. 

   Net income rose to $36.8 million, or 38 cents a share, from $33.1 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 7.5%, to $298.6 million from $277.9 million. 
Both were third-quarter records. 

   Nine-month earnings rose 12%, to $152.7 million, or $1.58 a share, from the year-earlier $136.9 million, or $1.41 a share. 
Excluding one-time after-tax gains of $29.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from the sale of investments in 1987, and $31.4 million, or 32 cents a share, from investment sales in 1986, earnings for the first nine months of 1987 were $123.3 million, or $1.27 a share, against $105.5 million, or $1.09 a share, in the like 1986 period, a 17% gain. 

   Nine-month revenue totaled $897.2 million, a 9% increase from the year-before $822.9 million. 

   Operating earnings declined 6.6% in the third quarter, trimming the gain for the nine months to 2.4%. 
The improvements in net income for the third quarter and nine months largely reflect a lower federal income tax rate and significant increases in equity earnings from Telerate Inc. and the company's newsprint mill affiliates. 

   Separately, Dow Jones said it purchased a minority interest in Mediatex Communications Corp., Austin, Texas, publisher of Texas Monthly magazine, which has a paid circulation of 295,000. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 
Mediatex will begin publishing Domain, a home and life style magazine, in December as a supplement to Texas Monthly. 

   As previously reported, Dow Jones purchased 5,271,600 shares of Telerate common stock on Sept. 25, 1987. 
This brought Dow Jones's holdings of Telerate common to 26,425,000 shares, or 56% of the total outstanding. 
Telerate's operations will be consolidated for accounting purposes with those of Dow Jones beginning in the fourth quarter. 

   Advertising linage at The Wall Street Journal declined 0.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier on an actual basis and 2.3% on a per-issue basis. 
Linage for the first nine months was up 1.4% on an actual basis and up 0.9% on a per-issue basis. 
The Journal's circulation on Sept. 30 was approximately the same as a year earlier. 

   Dow Jones Information Services, the company's newswire and electronic publishing arm, continued its strong growth. 
Revenue grew 18% during the third quarter and 22% for the year to date. 

   Advertising linage at Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the company's community newspapers subsidiary, increased 5.8% in the quarter and 5.5% in the first nine months. 
Circulation on Sept. 30 was slightly above a year earlier. 

   Advertising linage at Barron's magazine increased 15.1% in the third quarter and 11.8% for the nine months. 
Circulation on Sept. 30 was up slightly. 

   Richard D. Irwin Inc., the company's book publishing subsidiary, reported revenue gains of 7.5% for the quarter and 11% for the year to date. 

   In addition to The Wall Street Journal and Barron's, Dow Jones publishes computerized information services, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal, the Far Eastern Economic Review, domestic and international newswires, and radio and television reports. 
Ottaway Newspapers, which publishes daily newspapers in 22 communities, and Richard D. Irwin, a publisher of college textbooks and books for business executives, are wholly owned subsidiaries. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dow Jones closed at $44, down $1.875.
