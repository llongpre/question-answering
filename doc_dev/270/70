    Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad filed a libel suit in the country's High
Court against the Far Eastern Economic Review and the weekly
magazine's editor, Derek Davies.
   The suit stems from a brief story in the Hong Kong-based magazine's May 21 edition, which reported that Dr. Mahathir had discussed in March the sale of Limbang, an area in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, to neighboring Brunei. 
The edition was cleared by the government for distribution in Malaysia. 
But after publication, the report was denied by the Malaysian government, and the Review published a full retraction and apology in its June 4 edition. 

   Attorney General Abu Talib Othman, who filed the suit on behalf of Dr. Mahathir, said the prime minister was seeking unspecified damages for the article and for the subsequent retraction, according to Bernama, the national news agency. 
Bernama said Dr. Mahathir also is seeking a court order to stop the magazine from printing similar reports. 

   The Review and its Malaysian-based lawyer haven't been served with the papers, but they expect to be soon. 
"We will contest the action," said Philip Bowring, the magazine's deputy editor. 

   While apologizing for any embarrassment the report may have caused the prime minister, the magazine stated that the story "was published in good faith from sources which in the past have proved to be both well-informed and reliable." 

   The magazine is published by Far Eastern Economic Review Ltd., a subsidiary of New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co. Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal/Europe and The Asian Wall Street Journal.
