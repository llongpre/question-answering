   Peter R. Kann, publisher and editorial director
of the Wall Street Journal, has been elected to the additional posts
of president and chief operating officer of Dow Jones &amp; Co., the
business newspaper's parent company.
   Kann takes over the president's post from Warren H. Phillips, who
remains chairman and chief executive officer, Phillips said in a
news release Tuesday.
   Phillips also announced that William L. Dunn, 53, publisher of
Dow Jones' Information Services Group, has been appointed chairman
of that group and will concentrate on long-range projects. Dunn will
continue as an executive vice president of Dow Jones.
   Dunn, who joined Dow Jones in 1961 as a production assistant in
the Journal's Chicago printing plant, plans to retire in January,
1991, when he will be 55, Phillips said.
   Dow Jones spokesman Danforth W. Austin today said Dunn's decision
to leave the company in 1991 was based on personal reasons but he
would not specify.
   In the news release, Phillips said he was ``saddened'' by Dunn's
decision to retire in 1991, noting that Dunn has made ``incalculable
contributions to the growth of the company's electronic publishing
activities and also to the Journal.''
   Kann and Dunn widely had been considered the top contenders to
succeed Phillips.
   Carl M. Valenti, president of the Information Services Group, has
been given the additional post of publisher of that group, taking
over for Dunn.
   The company did not explain the reason for the management
changes. Phillips had been working without a No. 2 executive
following the retirement of president and chief operating officer
Ray Shaw earlier this year. Phillips had taken the president's job
and left the chief operating officer post unfilled.
   He said in the news release that Kann, 46, had ``proven himself
over many years as an executive of exceptional talent, breadth and
judgment.''
   Kann joined Dow Jones in 1964 as a reporter in the Journal's
Pittsburgh bureau. He went on to become the newspaper's reporter in
Vietnam and its Hong Kong correspondent. He won a Pulitzer Prize in
1972 for his 1971 coverage of the India-Pakistan war.
   Kann later served as the first publisher and editor of the Asian
Wall Street Journal. He returned to New York in 1979 and has held a
range of senior posts in Dow Jones.
   Dow Jones, based in New York, is a leading financial publications
and information concern. Its best-known product is the Journal, the
nation's largest daily newspaper with circulation of nearly 2
million.
