<HEAD>Singapore Bars Reporters From Covering Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said July 19 that reporters for
The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review
would be barred from covering the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference.
   The three-day conference, which begins July 29, will discuss the
economic course of the Asia-Pacific region. Representatives of the
United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan,
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore
are attending.
   The government has been at odds with the Journal and the Review,
a weekly magazine, for several years over alleged interference in
the domestic politics of this island city-state. Both are published
in Hong Kong by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of the United States.
   In a statement from New York, Dow Jones said that ``for reasons
that are unclear'' it appears Singapore ``is extending its
long-asserted right to restrict coverage of Singapore for
Singaporean readers (and) restrict coverage of international
economic meetings for all Asians.''
   In 1987, the government required the Journal to reduce its daily
circulation here to about 500 copies from 5,000. The Review was
ordered to cut its circulation to 400-500 copies a week from 10,000
but the magazine refused to continue selling in Singapore.
   Dow Jones said Singapore had given reporters for the U.S.-based
Wall Street Journal and AP-Dow Jones permission to attend the
conference. AP-Dow Jones is a joint venture of The Associated Press
and Dow Jones.
   The action against the Asian Journal and the Economic Review
came a day after Singapore's government introduced a bill in
Parliament that would require foreign newspapers wishing to
circulate in Singapore to get permission annually.

<HEAD>Press Freedom Group Calls Meeting To Aid Media in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Press Freedom Committee is urging
all organizations hoping to foster a free press in Eastern Europe
to coordinate their efforts through a meeting in October.
   ``An entirely new dimension of needs and opportunities faces all
of us,'' Harold W. Andersen, chairman of the committee and former
publisher of the Omaha World-Herald, said July 17. ``We all need to
know what is being done _ and not being done.''
   He urged interested organizations to take part in a one-day
conference at the National Press Club in Washington on Oct. 10.
   The 14-year-old committee, which represents 33 national and
international news organizations from five continents, already has
surveyed the media of Eastern Europe and has prepared a list of
possible projects.
   It also has published a ``Handbook for Journalists of Central
and Eastern Europe'' and is serving as a clearing house for media
organizations to match needs and resources.
   ``A substantial number of people and organizations, both public
and private, are trying to help,'' said Anderson. ``We need to
share information as to who is doing what. This should help all
parties avoid duplication and cooperate more freely.''
   He said the committee wanted participation from every
organization already helping East European media or even thinking
about it and urged them to contact the committee's Washington
office.
   The commitee's address is: The World Press Freedom Committee,
care of The Newspaper Center, P.O. Box 17407, Washington, D.C.
20041. Telephone: 703-648-1000; fax: 703-620-4557; telex: 292810.

<HEAD>British Court Raps `Abuse of Power' in County's Murdoch Ad Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The High Court ruled July 18 that a county
authority committed a ``flagrant abuse of power'' in withdrawing
its advertisements from a publication owned by Rupert Murdoch.
   The court said Derbyshire County Council's action was vindictive
and made a ``gross attempt to deceive the court'' about its reasons.
   The council claimed the ban on advertising in the Times
Educational Supplement was prompted by legitimate educational
reasons, but the two-judge panel ruled it was vengeance against the
Murdoch-owned Sunday Times for publishing articles criticizing
council leader David Bookbinder.
   Such decision-making could only have been prompted ``by bad
faith, or in a word, vindictiveness,'' said Judge Tasker Watkins.
   Quashing the ban as unlawful, he said it was a ``bad example of
local authority maladministration which is potentially, if not
actually, harmful to the interests of education in Derbyshire.''
   Local authorities control education in England and have budgets
to advertise for school staff.
   The council switched its advertising to the Guardian newspaper,
which charges higher rates and reaches a much smaller readership in
the education world than the Times Educational Supplement, the
court was told.
