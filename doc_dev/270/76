   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., the publisher of the Wall
Street Journal, said Wednesday it expects its profit for 1988 will
be up 11 percent to 14 percent from last year due principally to
non-recurring gains.
   But Warren H. Phillips, Dow Jones chairman and chief executive
officer, said that if nonrecurring items were excluded, the
company's earnings would be down 6 percent to 10 percent from a year
earlier.
   He said the decline reflected year-long softness in financial
advertising linage and revenue at its business publications in the
wake of the October 1987 stock market crash.
   In remarks prepared for delivery to securities analysts, Phillips
said he expected the company would earn between $226 million, or
$2.33 a share, and $232 million, or $2.39 a share, this year.
   In 1987, Dow Jones earned $203 million, or $2.10 a share, on
revenue of $1.31 billion.
   The company expects nonrecurring gains of $68 million, or 70
cents a share, this year compared with $29.4 million, or 30 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Excluding those gains, Phillips said Dow Jones' earnings for the
year would have fallen to between $158 million, or $1.63 a share,
and $164 million, or $1.69 a share.
   ``Dow Jones was affected more than most publishing comapnies by
the carnage in the financial community and among the investing
public that followed last year's market crash,'' he said.
   Phillips said he expects improved results at all of Dow Jones'
operations next year, ``barring a major recession.''
   In addition to the Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's
magazine, National Business Employment Weekly and American
Demographics magazine and offers Dow Jones News-Retrieval, a
computerized business and financial information service.
   It also owns Ottaway Newspapers Inc., which publishes daily
newspapers in 23 communities, and has a 67 percent stake in Telerate
Inc., a supplier of computerized financial information.
