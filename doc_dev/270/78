   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore lashed
out at the media today, blaming television for the bloody crackdown
on China's pro-democracy movement and the Western press for the
fluctuations in Hong Kong's stock exchange.
   Lee also defended his country's rigid restrictions on foreign
media, accusing newspapers such as the Asian Wall Street Journal,
of interfering in Singapore's domestic politics.
   In a related development, Dow Jones &amp; Co., the majority owners
of Asian Wall Street Journal, announced that it was halting
circulation of the newspaper in Singapore because of new
restrictions on the foreign press.
   Lee made his comments in a speech before the Commonwealth Press
Union, which comprises more than 500 newspapers, news agencies and
periodicals in 30 countries of the British Commonwealth.
   He said China's students, who took to the streets by the
hundreds of thousands in the spring of 1989, were seduced by
television into believing they could change China.
   ``I believe it is this contextless television experience that
led to the tragedy of Tiananmen on June 4,'' he said.
   On that day, soldiers marched on Beijing and crushed the
movement by driving thousands of students from Tiananmen Square.
Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed.
   Lee said students in China for years had watched Chinese news
reports on demonstrations in the Philippines and student protests
in South Korea.
   ``China's students forgot that China was a very different
country from either the Philippines or South Korea, two countries
with close links to the United States where the media and Congress
wield immense influence,'' he said.
   Lee also criticized the students for not compromising with
China's hard-line leaders.
   ``If they had been patient and circumspect, they could have
contributed over 10 years to the gradual opening up of the system,
which had already started,'' he said.
   Lee was to travel to Beijing on Tuesday, his fifth visit since
1976. China and Singapore normalized relations in August.
   In his speech, Lee also blasted the foreign press in Hong Kong
for trying ``to foist Western values'' on the British colony.
   He blamed the foreign press for causing large drops on Hong
Kong's stock market, which was rocked by the Tiananmen killings.
   ``Much of the gyrations ... could have been lessened if the
Western press based in Hong Kong had not crusaded for their vision
of democracy in Hong Kong,'' he said.
   Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997 and many in the
territory fear that Beijing will not keep its promise to maintain
the colony's freewheeling political and economic system for 50
years following the takeover.
   Lee did not define what he meant by foreign press, but it
appeared he was referring to Dow Jones' Asian Wall Street Journal
and its Far Eastern Economic Review. The two English-language
publications have been the sharpest critics in the territory of
both China and Britain in the run-up to 1997.
   The 67-year-old prime minister has had a running battle with
both publications and has often accused them of interfering in
Singapore's internal affairs.
   Lee said the Journal's move to stop circulating Asian Wall
Street Journal in Singapore was of little consequence. Singapore
already restricts the Journal's circulation to 400 copies a day.
   One of Singapore's new press restrictions requires foreign
publications to post a security deposit to pay for legal fees and
fines should the government take them to court.
