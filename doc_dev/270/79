   Singapore's Parliament approved legislation allowing the sale of photocopies of foreign publications whose circulation the government has curtailed. 

   Meanwhile, one of the publications whose circulation has been cut, The Far Eastern Economic Review, said it is halting its printing and regional distribution operations in Singapore. 

   Charles Stolbach, managing director of Review Publishing Co., publisher of the Hong Kong-based weekly, said the Review has been spending about $1.5 million a year on its Singapore printing and distribution. 
It will shift its Singapore operations to Hong Kong. 

   In December, Singapore slashed the Review's circulation to 500 copies from about 9,000 after alleging that the magazine was interfering in domestic politics. 
The Review responded by refusing to circulate any copies in Singapore. 

   Besides the restrictions on its circulation, the Review faces a libel suit filed by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. 

   The Review is owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of New York, which also owns The Wall Street Journal. 

   The Singapore parliament's action allows the photocopying and sale -- but not for profit -- of copies of restricted foreign publications. 

   Besides the Review, the government has curtailed the circulation of the Asian Wall Street Journal, which is majority-owned by Dow Jones; Asiaweek; and Time magazine, all for allegedly meddling in Singapore's domestic politics. 
Only Time's circulation has been restored.
