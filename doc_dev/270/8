   Dow Jones &amp; Co. reported record revenue and earnings for the first quarter of 1987. 

   Net income rose 8% to $66.7 million, or 69 cents a share, from year-earlier earnings of $61.8 million, or 64 cents a share. 

   Earnings included an after-tax gain of $29.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from the previously reported sale of the company's 18.9% interest in South China Morning Post Ltd. for $57.2 million. 
The 1986 first quarter included an after-tax gain of $31.4 million, or 32 cents a share, from the sale of two million shares of common stock of Continental Cablevision Inc. 

   Per-share figures reflect a 50% stock dividend in the form of Class B common stock last June 30. 

   Excluding the one-time gains from each period, earnings for the 1987 quarter rose 23% to $37.4 million, or 39 cents a share, from year-earlier earnings of $30.4 million, or 31 cents a share. 

   Revenue for the quarter increased 10% to $285.6 million from $259.7 million. 

   As part of the South China Morning Post transaction, the company purchased for $25.1 million the South China Morning Post's 51% interest in the Far Eastern Economic Review. 
This gave Dow Jones 100% ownership of the Review, an English-language business and economics weekly, published in Hong Kong, with a circulation of 64,000. 

   Dow Jones's operating income in the quarter rose 8.8% to $59.1 million, up from $54.3 million a year earlier. 
Equity earnings from investments in affiliated companies more than doubled during the quarter. 
Net income also benefited from a decline in the federal tax rate. 

   The increase in operating income reflects gains in linage and circulation at the company's business and community publications, plus continued strong revenue growth from the information services segment. 

   Wall Street Journal advertising linage increased 4.3% in the quarter. 
Journal circulation at the end of the quarter was approximately 2,048,000, up 2% from March 31, 1986. 

   Barron's advertising linage was up 7.8% and circulation increased about 3% to 296,000 during the quarter. 
Richard D. Irwin Inc., the company's book publishing subsidiary, reported a revenue gain of 6.4% for the period. 

   Dow Jones Information Services, the company's newswire and electronic publishing arm, reported a 25.3% revenue increase for the quarter. 

   Advertising linage at Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspapers subsidiary, was up 4.2% in the quarter. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, computerized information services, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal, domestic and international newswires and radio and television reports. 
Ottaway Newspapers, which publishes newspapers in 22 communities, and Richard D. Irwin, which publishes college textbooks and books for business executives, are wholly owned subsidiaries.
