<HEAD>Thailand Bans Asian Wall Street Journal for Story on Buddhism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today they are banning
local distribution of the Asian Wall Street Journal because of a
story they said had insulted the leader of Thailand's predominant
Buddhist faith.
   The newspaper is to be banned beginning Friday, said Lt. Col.
Samphan Sresthaphon of the Police Special Branch.
   Samphan singled out a story published July 21 about the conflict
between the Supreme Patriarch and the Santi Asoke, a fundamentalist
sect that accused the mainstream faith of materialism and other
un-Buddhist practices.
   Samphan said the article by John Berthelson, a Journal
correspondent based in Bangkok, amounted to ``disrespect'' for the
Supreme Patriarch ``and created disunity among Buddhists.''
   ``The paper will be allowed to be sold again if it makes a
request to the police,'' he said.
   Barry Wain, editor of the Journal, issued a statement in Bangkok
today saying that he noted with concern reports of the ban. ``We
are seeking urgent clarification from the Thai authorities,'' the
statement said. ``If the press reports are correct we will appeal
immediately against the ban.''
   The Asian Wall Street Journal is owned mainly by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
of the United States, which also publishes the Wall Street Journal.
The Asian Journal's editorial headquarters in Hong Kong said 2,500
copies are distributed in Thailand.
   Samphan also said authorities on Nov. 2 had lifted a ban on the
local distribution of the South China Morning Post newspaper of
Hong Kong. It had been banned since July because of an article
about rumors of a military coup in Thailand.
   Samphan said the special branch police were considering action
against the Far Eastern Economic Review, a Hong Kong-based
newsweekly, because of a Nov. 2 article on Thai prostitution.
   And he said action also may be taken against The Economist, the
London-based newsweekly, for an article that he said satirized Thai
Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's policy on Cambodia.
   Last week, the Tourism Authority of Thailand issued a statement
protesting the Review article's suggestion that the authority
indirectly protected Thailand's huge sex industry because it draws
many foreign tourists.
   The Review's circulation in Thailand is 3,030, said its Hong
Kong editorial headquarters.
   Thailand is considered one of the freest countries in Southeast
Asia for the foreign press.
