   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it agreed to acquire from Oklahoma Publishing Co. 8,873,702 shares of common stock of Telerate Inc. in exchange for 4,436,851 newly issued shares of Dow Jones common stock. 
The transaction is expected to be completed today. 

   The Telerate shares amount to about 9.4% of the total outstanding, bringing Dow Jones's ownership to 63,059,170 shares, or about 66.5%. 
The Telerate shares were originally acquired by Oklahoma Publishing in 1985. 

   The newly issued Dow Jones shares will represent about 4.3% of Dow Jones's common and Class B common stock outstanding. 
The closing price of Dow Jones common stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday was $32.75, down 75 cents; Telerate's closing price was $15.125, up 50 cents. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, other periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers. 
Telerate provides computerized financial information on global markets. 

   A Dow Jones spokesman said issuance of the shares would have a "minimal" dilutive effect, substantially offset by reducing the minority interest in Telerate that isn't included in Dow Jones's net income and per-share earnings.
