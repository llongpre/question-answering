<HEAD>Singapore Acts Against Foreign Reporters It Says Pose As Tourists</HEAD>

   The Home Affairs Ministry said Monday Singapore
has barred the entry of journalists representing the Far Eastern
Economic Review and the Asian Wall Street Journal because of
foreign reporters posing as tourists.
   It said in a statement that correspondents of the Far Eastern
Economic Review, a weekly magazine published in Hong Kong,
repeatedly entered Singapore as tourists but for the purpose of
reporting in violation of immigration law.
   ``Because of this flagrant abuse, the government has decided not
to allow any correspondent from (the Review) and the sister
publication Asian Wall Street Journal to visit Singapore on social
visit passes,'' the statement said.
   It said Rodney Tasker, a Review correpondent, would not be
allowed to re-enter Singapore and Raphael Pura, a reporter for the
Asian Wall Street Journal, had been asked to leave.''
   Pura, based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, has said immigration
officials let him enter Singapore Wednesday but ordered him to
leave by Thursday night.
   Tasker, the Review's chief correspondent, said in a telephone
interview he was refused entry last Wednesday when he arrived from
Bangkok, Thailand, at Singapore's Changi Airport. Both
correspondents were to cover general elections set for Sept. 3.
   The government restricted circulation of the Review and the
Asian Wall Street Journal last year, accusing correspondents of the
two publications of having engaged in activities of a political
nature.
   Both publications are subsidiaries of Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc., of
the United States.
