   Pearson PLC of Britain agreed to acquire the French business publisher Les Echos S.A., a further sign of the big British company's increasingly aggressive media acquisition strategy. 

   The stock and cash purchase would value family-owned Les Echos, publisher of France's largest business daily, also called Les Echos, at about 886 million francs ($160.4 million), according to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times of London. 

   The United Kingdom concern has tried to shake off a stodgy image and persistent takeover rumors with a flurry of media acquisitions recently. 
Analysts previously had criticized Pearson for failing to realize the Financial Times's potential by expanding into related businesses. 

   Frank Barlow, chief executive officer of Pearson's Financial Times unit, said the acquisition of Les Echos would "complement the Financial Times's commitment to serve the European business community." 

   The Pearson acquisition also would represent further consolidation in the European business-publishing industry. 
Last July, New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co. agreed to buy 14% of Groupe Expansion S.A., a large French business-press group. 
Its publications include the business magazine L'Expansion and the daily newspaper La Tribune de l'Expansion, Les Echos's main competitor. 

   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal/Europe, The Asian Wall Street Journal, the financial weekly Barron's and the Far Eastern Economic Review. 

   Jacqueline Beytout, president of Les Echos, said the sale -- which she sought partly to avoid the effects of French inheritance taxes on the paper after her death -- wasn't motivated by Dow Jones's investment in the competing Expansion group. 
Dow Jones announced its investment after she had begun negotiating with Pearson, she said. 
She said she anticipates cooperative agreements with Pearson, including the creation of a joint data bank on European companies. 

   Under terms of the Les Echos transaction, Pearson is offering 7,375,000 shares to Mrs. Beytout and 355 million francs to other Beytout family members. 
After the sale, Mrs. Beytout would continue to head Les Echos and would hold a potentially friendly 3.5% stake in Pearson. 

   Mrs. Beytout said that she hopes to join Pearson's board but that a formal agreement hasn't been reached. 
A Pearson spokesman said, however, that the company would seek her advice but wouldn't offer her a board seat. 

   The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of March after Les Echos's 1987 accounts have been audited, Pearson said. 
A Pearson spokesman said the acquisition is expected to win French regulatory approval. 

   Pearson shares were quoted at 720 pence ($13.11), down three pence, in late trading yesterday on London's stock exchange. 

   This would be Pearson's third purchase since the acquisitive publisher Rupert Murdoch announced last September that he had a 14.49% stake in the U.K. concern. 
Pearson has since acquired a British database company, now called Profile Information, and agreed to acquire a 25% stake in a new Canadian business daily, the Financial Post. 
It also has held talks with Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court about the possible purchase of business publications such as the Australian Financial Review. 

   Founded in 1908, Les Echos has a paid circulation of about 70,000 and circulation is growing at about 5% or 6% a year, according to Mrs. Beytout. 
The group also publishes a daily and a weekly medical journal and has minority investments in two television stations and in the weekly news magazine Le Point. 

   Although detailed financial results weren't available, Les Echos officials said the company's sales totaled about 400 million francs last year, with consolidated pretax profit of about 60 million francs. 
Both figures represent about a 20% increase from 1986, the officials said. 
The concern had cash and short-term marketable securities of more than 100 million francs as of Nov. 30, Pearson said.
