   The Wall Street Journal dropped two ad agencies, consolidating its circulation and advertising-trade advertising with Austin, Texas-based GSD&amp;M, which currently is helping the newspaper plan its 1989 centennial. 

   Circulation advertising for the Journal previously was handled by Minneapolis-based Fallon McElligott. 
Trade advertising had been handled by WPP Group PLC's Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein. 

   Peter R. Kann, Journal executive vice president and its associate publisher, said the move was intended "to avoid inevitable overlap between centennial promotion and regular circulation and advertising promotion." 

   The Journal is published by New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co., which also publishes Barron's Weekly, community weekly newspapers and books and operates newswire and other information services.
