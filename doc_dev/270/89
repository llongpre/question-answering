   The Far Eastern Economic Review was sued for libel by Singapore's premier, Lee Kuan Yew. 

   The lawsuit followed the government's previously reported decision to slash the Review's circulation in Singapore for allegedly interfering in domestic politics. 

   Mr. Lee began legal proceedings Thursday in Singapore after the Hong Kong-based weekly refused to meet his deadline for issuing a retraction and apology for an article his lawyers said defamed him. 
The Dec. 17 article contradicted the government's version of events surrounding the detentions of 22 alleged Marxists last May and June. 
Many of those arrested were associated with the Roman Catholic Church. 

   The Review is owned by New York-based Dow Jones &amp; Co., which also publishes The Wall Street Journal. 

   Last week, the Review announced it would refuse to distribute any copies of its magazine in Singapore rather than comply with the Dec. 26 government order restricting its circulation to 500 copies. 
The Review's Singapore circulation had been about 9,000 out of a total circulation of 74,500. 

   The Review was the third regional publication to have its circulation sharply restricted in Singapore. 
Circulation of The Asian Wall Street Journal, in which Dow Jones owns a majority stake, was cut last February. 
Hong Kong-based Asiaweek, which is majority-owned by Time Inc. of the U.S., had its circulation reduced in October. 

   In Washington, the president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors protested the restrictions on the Review in a message to Mr. Lee. 
The society represents 1,000 editors of daily newspapers in the U.S. and Canada.
