   The government said Thursday that reporters for
The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review
would be barred from covering the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference.
   The three-day conference, which begins July 29, will discuss the
economic course of the Asia-Pacific region. Representatives of the
United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan,
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore
are attending.
   The government has been at odds with the Journal and the Review,
a weekly magazine, for several years over alleged interference in
the domestic politics of this island city-state. Both are published
in Hong Kong by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of the United States.
   Dow Jones in a statement Thursday from New York said that ``for
reasons that are unclear'' it appears Singapore ``is extending its
long-asserted right to restrict coverage of Singapore for
Singaporean readers (and) restrict coverage of international
economic meetings for all Asians.
   ``Dow Jones fears that the government's actions against the
Review and Asian Journal are therefore entirely coercive or
punitive,'' the statement said.
   In 1987, the government required the Journal to reduce its daily
circulation here to about 500 copies from 5,000. The Review was
ordered to cut its circulation to 400-500 copies a week from 10,000
but the magazine refused to continue selling in Singapore.
   The Dow Jones statement also noted ``that Singapore has given
reporters for the U.S. edition of the Journal and for AP-Dow Jones
permission to attend'' the conference.
   AP-Dow Jones is a joint venture of The Associated Press and Dow
Jones.
   On Wednesday, the government introduced a bill in Parliament
that would require foreign newspapers wishing to circulate in
Singapore to get permission annually.
