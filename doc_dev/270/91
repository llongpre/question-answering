   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, on Monday said net income declined during the third
quarter and the year's first nine months as the acquisition of
Telerate Inc. weighed on profits.
   Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 totaled $23.76
million, or 24 cents a share, down 17.5 percent from $28.81
million, or 29 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $408.54 million, up 1.1 percent
from $404.08 million a year ago.
   The company said net income for the quarter was reduced 11 cents
- and 34 cents for the year to date - due to higher expenses
related to the acquisition of Telerate, which was completed in
January.
   Dow Jones also said operating results were distorted by
development costs for Telerate's electronic foreign exchange
trading system. This year Dow Jones bore 100 percent of the costs;
last year the company shared the cost with a 50 percent partner.
   Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $185.11 million within the company's
information services unit, which includes Telerate, but operating
income within the segment was down 36.1 percent at $35.01 million
in part because of retrenchment within the financial services
industry.
   On the publishing front, Dow Jones said operating income from
its business publications, including the Journal, Barron's magazine
and others, fell 79.6 percent to $2.72 million on a 3.6 percent
decline in revenue, which totaled $165.84 million. Advertising
lineage at the Journal declined 16 percent during the period.
   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspaper subsidiary, saw
a 7.4 decline in operating income, which totaled $2.72 million, on
$59.59 million in revenue, which represented a 1.5 percent gain
from the third quarter of 1989.
   For the first nine months, Dow Jones said net income totaled
$83.51 million, or 83 cents a share, down 69.9 percent from $277.17
million, or $2.75 a share in the year-ago period.
   Excluding a one-time gain in 1989, net income for the first nine
months declined 26.1 percent.
   Revenue for the first nine months totaled $1.28 billion, up 2.3
percent from $1.25 billion a year earlier.
