   NEW YORK -- Telerate Inc., a subsidiary of Dow Jones &amp;
Co., said it signed a letter of intent with Minex Corp. of
Japan to enter detailed discussions on an exclusive
international sales and distributorship agreement for a new
global foreign exchange automated matching service.
   Separately, Dow Jones said net income for the second
quarter declined 0.5% to $34.7 million, or 34 cents a share,
from year-earlier net income of $34.9 million, or 35 cents a
share.

   Telerate, a real-time financial information service,
already operates The Trading Service, a system that permits
direct dealing in foreign exchange and identifies currency
traders to one another. The contemplated automated matching
service would match buy and sell orders electronically while
keeping traders' identities secret.
   The announcement is the latest move in the increasingly
competitive field of currency trading, believed to be the
world's largest financial market -- with volume averaging
$700 billion a day -- and one with rapidly changing
technology.
   Twelve banks and Citicorp's Quotron Systems Inc. unit last
month said they plan to develop a new currency trading system
in the next 18 months. And Reuters Holdings PLC has been
working on a similar system for some time, but its
introduction has been delayed.
   A spokeswoman for Citicorp's Quotron Systems declined to
comment on Telerate's announcement but said: "We currently
have a prototype of a system being tested by the banks
participating in the project." Additional banks have been
invited to participate in the development process. The
spokeswoman declined to disclose how much money has been
committed to the project, or how many people are working on
it.
   A spokesman for Reuters declined to comment on the
announcement.
   Telerate said Minex represents a group of banks and
brokers and the Japanese telecommunications company Kokusai
Denshin Denwa. Others in the venture include Tokyo Forex,
Japan's largest foreign exchange brokerage; Industrial Bank
of Japan; Bank of Tokyo; Sanwa Bank; Daiichi Kangyo Bank;
Mitsubishi Bank; Mitsubishi Trust Bank; Sumitomo Bank; Fuji
Bank; Mitsui Taiyo Kobe, Kobayashi; and Tullet &amp; Tokyo
International Ltd.
   Telerate said that $70 million has been committed to the
project, and that 200 programmers and engineers are working
on software and hardware.
   Under the proposal to be discussed, Minex and Telerate
would introduce and market a foreign exchange automated
matching service, initially for use between participating
members in New York, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore,
by March 1993. Prototype systems have already been
demonstrated to several financial institutions.
   Telerate and K.K. Kyodo News Service have acquired a joint
4% equity shareholding in Minex. K.K. Kyodo News Service is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Kyodo News Service of Japan and is
the sole distributor in Japan of Telerate products and
services. Kyodo/Telerate is the division of K.K. Kyodo
responsible for marketing and distribution of Telerate
products in Japan.
   Dow Jones's net income for the six months ended June 30
was $52.7 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $59.8
million, or 59 cents a share, for the first half of 1990, a
decline of 12%.
   Improved operating results at Telerate and lower interest
expense were offset by reduced advertising linage at The Wall
Street Journal and lower earnings at the company's community
newspaper segment in the first six months of the year.
   Second-quarter operating income increased 0.5% to $71.2
million. Revenue increased 0.3% to $442.9 million. First-half
operating income declined 11% to $118.1 million on a revenue
decrease of 1.1% to $859.5 million.
   The information services segment, which includes the
results of the company's Information Services Group and
Telerate, contributed second-quarter operating income of
$34.7 million, a 26% increase from the year-earlier period.
Revenue increased 5% to $187.8 million in the second quarter.
   Business publications operating income declined 13% in the
second quarter to $32.8 million on revenue of $196.1 million,
a decline of 2.7%. Advertising linage at The Wall Street
Journal declined 9.4% in the second quarter and 15% in the
first half of 1991 compared with the year-earlier periods.
Barron's magazine linage declined 17% in the second quarter
and 16% through the first six months.
   Operating income at Ottaway Newspapers Inc., Dow Jones's
community newspaper subsidiary, declined 20% to $8.5 million
in the second quarter. Second-quarter revenue declined 3.6%
to $58.9 million. Advertising linage at Ottaway's 23 daily
newspapers declined 13% in the second quarter and 12% in the
first six months.
