   A federal appeals court upheld a judge's ruling that The Wall Street Journal didn't libel Liberty Lobby Inc. 

   In an opinion written by Judge Robert Bork, released on his last day as a federal judge, the three-judge panel said the lawsuit "epitomizes one of the most troubling aspects of modern libel litigation: the use of the libel complaint as a weapon to harass." 

   Liberty Lobby filed the lawsuit in November 1984, alleging that it was defamed by a September 1984 Journal article. 
The lawsuit faulted the article for calling Liberty Lobby an "anti-Semitic" organization, and for saying that Liberty Lobby had published works of Roger Pearson, a writer who advocates genetic purity of the white race. 
A complaint about a column by Suzanne Garment, then a writer for the Journal's editorial page, was later added to the lawsuit. 

   Joined by Judges Harry Edwards and Stephen Williams, Judge Bork, who returned to the bench for several months after his nomination to the Supreme Court was defeated, said the evidence tended to show the truth of the Journal's statements. 
Moreover, the appeals court said, there was no evidence that the Journal acted with "actual malice" or reckless disregard for the truth. 

   Mark Lane, Liberty Lobby's lawyer in the matter, repeated yesterday that the group is anti-Zionist, not anti-Semitic, and said that the case is "just beginning." 
He said he will ask the court of appeals as a whole and the Supreme Court to review Judge Bork's refusal to recuse himself from the case. 
Mr. Lane was critical of some of the judges who oversaw the case, arguing that Judge Bork is an old friend of prominent Washington lawyer Leonard Garment, the husband of the former Journal columnist. 
Last year Mr. Garment campaigned vigorously in support of Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, but he acknowledged that he did so on his own, without encouragement from or contact with the nominee. 

   Judge Bork said last night that Mr. Garment is a friend, but not so close as to require the judge to recuse himself. 
The judge said he responded to the specifics of Mr. Lane's motion that he should be recused with an opinion that is on file. 
He added, "If I recused myself on every case on which some person or group involved was for me or against me, I'd be out of an awful lot of cases." 

   The Wall Street Journal is published by Dow Jones &amp; Co., which also publishes Barron's Weekly, community newspapers, Dow Jones News Retrieval and newswires. 
A Dow Jones spokesman declined to comment.
