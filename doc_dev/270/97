   National Broadcasting Co. is expected this fall to drop its "Before Hours" morning business show, which it produces in association with The Wall Street Journal. 

   An NBC News spokeswoman would say only that NBC is considering such a move, and that if so, it may incorporate parts of the business news programming into its "NBC News at Sunrise" broadcast or in its new cable television venture with Tempo Enterprises Inc. 

   Norman Pearlstine, The Wall Street Journal's managing editor, said: "It is our understanding that 'Before Hours' will be pre-empted this summer for coverage of the Olympics from Seoul and that a decision will be made after the Olympics about its future." 
He added: "Dow Jones has been proud to be associated with 'Before Hours,' and we would be disappointed if it is taken off the air. 
But we have had and do have now a good relationship with NBC, and we have been talking with them about other possible business programming cooperation." 

   As previously reported, NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., plans to program a cable business news service from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays starting in early 1989 on Tempo, which has agreed to be acquired by cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. 
Although NBC had planned to buy the 12-million subscriber Tempo channel, it said two weeks ago that it decided to lease it instead. 

   Some at NBC News had expected GE to pull its resources from "Before Hours" after it announced its decision to invest in the cable business show. 
The NBC spokeswoman acknowledged the cable channel would provide a much bigger audience for business news. 

   "Before Hours" was started early last year, and ran in various markets on NBC affiliates five days a week at varying times between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. 
The NBC spokeswoman said the broadcast garnered only about 400,000 viewers, or a 0.8% rating. 
If the program were to be incorporated in the "News at Sunrise," it would have approximately tripled the audience, she said. 

   Dow Jones also produces "The Wall Street Journal Report," a weekly half-hour syndicated show, and other syndicated daily news features. 
Additionally, Dow Jones publishes Barron's magazine and other periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers. 
It owns 56% of Telerate Inc., which provides computerized financial information on global markets.
