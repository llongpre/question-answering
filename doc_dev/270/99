   The chairman and chief executive at Dow Jones &amp;
Co. announced his retirement, but company officials say the move is
not connected to The Wall Street Journal parent's recent financial
troubles.
   Warren H. Phillips, 64, has been chief executive of the media
and financial information company since 1975 and chairman since
1978. He will relinquish his chief executive duties at the first of
the year and retire as chairman next July 1. Phillips will stay on
as a director.
   He will be 65 by the time of his retirement as chairman.
   Phillips' decision was based on the customary retirement age of
65, said Dow Jones spokesman Roger May.
   Eric Philo, a media analyst at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., said
Phillips' announcement was not a great surprise. He agreed it
probably was not connected with the company's financial problems.
   ``He has been operating in a very difficult environment in the
past several years,'' Philo said, citing the cutbacks on Wall
Street and the softness in the advertising market. ``You can't lay
it at his doorstep,'' he said.
   Journal newsroom speculation differed.
   ``This could be Phillips saying these problems are going to be
tough to solve and take a long time,'' a reporter, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said.
   Peter R. Kann, the company's president and chief operating
officer, will succeed Phillips as chief executive. Kann, 47, also
is publisher of the Journal.
   No date has been set for the board to elect a successor to
Phillips as chairman, said Dana Jennings, another company
spokesman.
   ``These actions will provide an orderly transition of executive
responsibility,'' Phillips said in a statement. ``After an
immensely satisfying 43-year career at Dow Jones and more than 15
years as CEO, it is time for me to step down and allow a new CEO
and his colleagues to provide fresh energy and continuity of
leadership in the years ahead.''
   In addition to the Journal, Dow Jones publishes the weekly
financial newspaper Barron's, produces a weekly financial
television show and provides financial information electronically.
   Dow Jones announced in an internal memo last Thursday that it
was freezing budgets for capital spending and salaries and imposing
other news and business spending cuts to cope with weak financial
results and the sluggish economy. The memo did not rule out
layoffs.
   The memo followed an announced 17.5 percent slide in
third-quarter profits, attributed principally to the company's
acquisition of the financial information service Telerate Inc. Dow
Jones also has been hurt by the recession plaguing Wall Street
since the 1987 stock market crash.
   Operating income at Dow Jones' business publications dropped 80
percent in the third quarter. Advertising linage at the Journal
dropped 16 percent in the period.
   At a regular monthly meeting Wednesday, the company's directors
approved Kann's new duties and elected Kenneth L. Burenga executive
vice president and successor to Kahn as chief operating officer.
Burenga, 46, currently is senior vice president and general
manager.
   The board also elected Burenga and Carl M. Valenti as members of
the board. Valenti, 52, is president and publisher of Dow Jones'
Information Services Group and president and chief operating
officer of Telerate.
   Phillips' career with Dow Jones began in 1947, when he joined
the Journal as a copy reader. He was named news editor in 1953,
managing editor in 1957, executive editor of Dow Jones publications
in 1965 and editorial director in 1971, a post he held for 17
years. Thereafter he held a variety of executive posts, leading to
his appointments as CEO and chairman.
   Dow Jones annual revenue has risen from $238 million when
Phillips became chief executive to $1.69 billion.
   Under Phillips' leadership, the Journal has expanded to three
sections, adding coverage beyond financial news. The paper added a
European edition and Dow Jones completed the purchase of Telerate
Inc., an electronic financial information service in the past
decade.
   The Dow board gave Phillips a $1 million bonus last year for his
long service to the company.
   Last year, the company earned $317 million, compared with a
profit of $228.2 million on revenue of $1.6 billion in 1988.
