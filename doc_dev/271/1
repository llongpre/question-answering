<LEADPARA>  I PROBABLY shouldn't admit to liking Dread Zeppelin, any more than I should
admit to eating chocolate-covered Twinkies, or having seen every episode of
"The Brady Bunch.";    But I loved the Southern California band's show at San
Jose's Oasis on Sunday night. It may have been as tacky as a black-velvet
Elvis painting, but it was as irresistible as junk food, and a whole lotta fun.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This band throws a party for the '90s, redoing Led Zeppelin standards with
a reggae beat, mixing in vocals from a 300-pound Elvis impersonator and
putting on a Three Stooges stage show. They kept several hundred people on
their feet for 90 minutes.;    The six-member band hasn't sold 250,000 albums
on absurdity alone. They showed a certain musical integrity, paying homage to
Zeppelin and Elvis, while making fun of their excesses.;    Singer Gregg
Tortell, who goes by the name "Tortelvis," may look like Humphrey the Whale in
long sideburns and a rhinestone jumpsuit, but he sings the way Elvis might
have sounded if he got hip to the '70s and belted out some Zeppelin tunes in
the shower. Tortelvis merged "Black Dog" with "Hound Dog," slowing the Zep
song into a sexy reggae dirge.;    Lead guitarist Carl Haasis, known as Carl
Jah, reminds you that despite the pretensions and the Aleister Crowley
gobbledygook, Jimmy Page reinvented the guitar on every song.;    Jah captured
every magic moment and then some. Like during the solo in the show's
centerpiece, "Heartbreaker"/"Heartbreak Hotel.";    He stopped the band and
played Page's lead, one handed, walking from one side of the stage to the
other. Then, as the solo built, screaming and whining, Tortelvis's towel man
and hairdresser walked up to Jah, looked at his watch and signaled that the
guitarist was playing too long.;    Page probably would have stomped off the
stage, but Jah shrugged his shoulders and waited until the crowd screamed for
him to go on.;    Led Zeppelin was never known for its sense of humor, but if
its members ever did let down their hair, they might have done "Stairway to
Heaven" the way Tortelvis did it. As his reggae version rose to its crescendo,
he cut it off, sang "America the Beautiful" and then returned to "Stairway" to
end the show.;    In a bizarre way, it worked. It also worked when the band
took apart "Whole Lotta Love," "Your Time is Gonna Come" and "Rock and Roll"
and put them back together adding their own signatures. They made you forget
the originals.;    The big question for the Dreads is what comes after they've
done the Zep catalog? Bass player Gary Putnam, a former male stripper who
performed wearing only zebra underpants and cowboy boots, may have given a
hint when he began a solo version of Madonna's "Like a Virgin.";    The best
thing about Dread Zep is they don't ask you to take them too seriously. And
it's pretty hard to fault them for lack of originality in a decade when M.C.
Hammer recycles old Prince and Rick James songs into hits.;    The opening
band, the Guttersluts, played a solid half hour of original songs. These five
women, who have played together for two years, were fast and frenetic, sort of
like the Go-Gos without the hair spray and with more of an edge.;    There may
have been more to their lyrics and melodies than could be heard the first time
through, but much of it was lost to the show's frantic energy. They were worth
a second listen.  </TEXT>
