   Led Zeppelin was together again with ``Whole
Lotta Love'' to help celebrate the 40th birthday of Atlantic
Records.
   The 11-hour concert at Madison Square Garden featured performers
from the early years of the pioneering rhythm-and-blues label
through its latest in pop and rock stars.
   A full house heard the Coasters kick off the show with ``That is
Rock 'n' Roll,'' then settled in to hear the likes of Crosby,
Stills &amp; Nash, Roberta Flack, Wilson Pickett, and Phil Collins and
Genesis.
   Led Zeppelin came on stage together ``for the first time in more
years than I can think of,'' said Ahmet Ertegun, Atlantic founder
and chairman of the board, in introducing the group shortly after 1
a.m. Sunday. The band also played ``Misty Mountain Hop'' and
``Stairway to Heaven.''
   Subbing for the late John Bonham as the Zeppelin's drummer
Saturday night was Bonham's son, Jason. The elder Bonham died in
1980.
   Debbie Gibson, the 17-year-old pop star from Long Island, said
she was excited to represent Atlantic's ``new generation'' and sang
a medley of her hits.
