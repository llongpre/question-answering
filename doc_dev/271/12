All-Led Zeppelin Format: A Florida radio station has switched to what it claims 
-- and who would doubt them? -- is the world's only all-Led Zeppelin radio 
format. WKRL-FM in Clearwater made the cutover on New Year's Day after spending 
New Year's Eve repeatedly playing the 1971 hit "Stairway to Heaven."

Led Zeppelin is "just a very, very strong classic rock group, very prolific and 
engaging," said Daniel DiLoreto, manager of WKRL, which until Monday was the 
Tampa area's "only classic rock station." The new format is so restrictive that 
even solo efforts from members of the now-defunct British band will not be 
aired. The group released 10 albums over a 12-year period, and broke up in 
December, 1980, after drummer John Bonham died of an alcohol overdose. Shauna
