BIG F TURNS BACK ON HEAVY METAL FASHION MODE

It is hard to say which Southern California institution is the most 
scandalously bankrupt: Lincoln Savings, or Hollywood Heavy Metal. 
</P>
<P>
The pages of photo ads in the pulp music magazines that chronicle the L.A. hard 
rock scene tell a story of creative and imaginative collapse that would be 
hilarious if it weren't so sad. Band after band appears in one of two ritual 
guises: the frowning, leather-clad tough-guy clones of Guns N' Roses, and the 
fluffy-haired, prettified fops made up in Poison's pouting image. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vision of rock as a beauty pageant, or a game of follow-the-leader, in 
which riches and fame await those who can best embody some pre-cast standard of 
outrageousness and rebelliousness. In a world where walking, cussing cliches 
like Warrant (this year's prize L.A. metal spawn) can sell a million albums, 
the inducements to run from individuality are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The Big F is one Los Angeles hard rock band that has turned its back on the 
fashion sweepstakes. From the start, said Rob Donin, the power trio's drummer, 
the Big F decided that it would stay clear of the Los Angeles hard rock scene 
and its cliches. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't hang out in the Hollywood clubs, and we're not trying to get in with 
the Sunset scene," said Donin, whose band opens for Soundgarden tonight at the 
Marquee in Westminster. "It seems there are a few bands out there that are 
really sincere, and 2 million others jumping on the bandwagon with this 
instantaneous toughness. To me that's not rock 'n' roll. It's a Hollywood 
fabrication. We didn't want to be a typical rock poseur band. There had to be 
some substance there." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making the Hollywood scene, Donin, singer-bassist John Shreve and 
guitarist Mark Christian spent most of the past three years in their tiny 
rehearsal room in North Hollywood coming up with the dark-visioned hard rock 
songs that appear on their debut album. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big F" is not a work of striking originality -- the echoes of such power 
rock precursors as Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and, to a lesser extent, 
Aerosmith are much too obvious for that. But the band does pack a good deal of 
emotional force into its collection of melodic, hard-riffing rockers. If 
Shreve's wailing vocal style owes a big debt to Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant, it 
also carries a raw, all-out immediacy that makes the Big F's songs sound like 
intensely felt statements rather than studied Zeppelin tributes. 
</P>
<P>
The band's adopted emblem, a grotesquely phallic scene from a painting by 
Hieronymous Bosch, tells a good deal about its thematic slant. The Big F's 
ambiguous, symbol-laden songs frequently depict forces of control, ranging from 
religion to drugs to fashion, clashing with a fierce, sometimes threatening 
sexual energy. While the Hollywood metal crowd treats sex as a commercial 
come-on, the Big F seems serious about delving into sexuality as a source of 
mystery and power. 
</P>
<P>
"There are emotional elements within the three of us that we like to purge 
through the music," Donin said in a recent phone interview from a tour stop in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of frustration and anguish that comes out. We don't repress 
things. There is a violent element within all of us. You repress that and, in 
my opinion, that's when you have these nut cases going around killing people. 
They repress until it blows up." 
</P>
<P>
That let-it-out philosophy also applies to how the band has operated 
internally, Donin said. "The casual observer would think this band is ready to 
fall apart" because of its members' penchant for arguing creative issues 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
"It's those instances when we are really angry at each other that things come 
out great. Each of us wants to be a dictator, and I think that's healthy. As a 
result you get a constant clash, and what comes out of it is pretty powerful 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Donin said that he, Shreve and Christian, all in their mid-20s, formed the Big 
F (he said the initial has no set meaning) after running across each other in 
separate Los Angeles bands. The band made no effort to build a local following, 
playing only a few dates last spring to which its manager invited record label 
scouts. The Big F had expected to release its first album on its own but 
Elektra Records offered a deal that Donin said gave the band the full artistic 
control it was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
While a name-brand producer is usually considered a prerequisite for a hard 
rock release on a major label, the Big F's members produced their album 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Other labels that suggested stuff like that (bringing in a producer) were 
immediately dismissed," Donin said. "There are very few labels other than 
Elektra that would accept 100% creative control." 
</P>
<P>
One consequence of not having cultivated a following on the Hollywood scene is 
that the Big F is emerging as a completely unknown band with no base of fan 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what our following is at this point," Donin said. "I don't know 
if the Big F is an alternative band. It certainly isn't in my mind a heavy 
metal band. Extensive touring right now is going to find the audience because I 
don't know where it is right now. There is definitely an audience out there for 
this. We have yet to clash with each other." 
</P>
<P>
The Big F, Soundgarden and Skin Tight play tonight at 8 at the Marquee, 7000 
Garden Grove Blvd., Westminster. Tickets: $10. Information: (714) 891-1181.
