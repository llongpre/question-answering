   ``Blow Up Your Video'' (Atlantic) _ AC@DC
   
   It may surprise those who lived through it, but the 1970s are
now regarded as a golden age for heavy metal rock. A glance at
magazine covers attests to Led Zeppelin's continued deification.
Aerosmith has returned to the charts and even Ted Nugent has a new
record in the stores.
   Australian hard rockers AC@DC hope their new ``Blow Up Your
Video'' album can return them to a place of prominence.
   It just might. Years on the road have taught this band that
sparkling originality is much less a prerequisite for heavy metal
success than a loud noise that packs a wallop.
   Angus Young may be looking more ridiculous every year in his
English schoolboy's outfit, but it probably reassures the kids that
he knows what they like. AC@DC delivers songs of alienation and
macho posturing with muscle.
   ``Blow Up Your Video'' has a series of solid riffs, even though
some sound a little too familiar. With ``That's the Way I Wanna
Rock 'n' Roll,'' AC@DC joins a long list of Led Zeppelin immitators.
   ``Heatseeker'' is the kind of good-time rocker that could become
an anthem for teen-aged boys out looking for girls or trouble, or
both. ``This Means War,'' with a rhythm that shifts into overdrive,
is a headbanger's delight.
   The remainder of the songs falls into that great mass of metal
that all tends to sound the same after awhile. At least AC@DC has
the sense to avoid turgid ballads. Brian Johnson's voice never gets
lower than a howl, or occasional growl.
   ``Highway to Hell'' and ``Back in Black'' have always been
considered AC@DC's peaks. ``Blow Up Your Video'' won't cause any
reassessments, but the band isn't ready for a rest home of 1970s
stars.

   ``Dancing in the Dark'' (Milestone) _ Sonny Rollins
   
   In his first studio date in four years, Sonny Rollins once again
seduces us with his sweet and swinging tenor saxophone.
   There are several new compositions by the jazz vituoso on
``Dancing in the Dark,'' which blends calypso, pop, reggae and
bebop.
   His ballad, ``Promise,'' is a lovely tune that allows him some
lyrical riffs with the sax. Another ballad, ``Just Once,'' made
popular by James Ingram years ago, is a good stab at contemporary
pop. Rollins' ``Duke of Iron'' is pure Trinidadian calypso fun.
   ``Dancing in the Dark'' opens with a lovely sax solo by Rollins,
and illuminates all the right romantic licks of the Arthur
Schwartz-Howard Dietz 1930s hit that was first introduced in the
revue, ``The Band Wagon.''
   Another '30s hit, Harry Warren's ``I'll String Along With You,''
has been rearranged by Rollins into a reggae beat. It is part of
Rollins' artistry that always stretches to do something just a
little different _ to keep jazz not only traditional but fresh
without selling out to fusion.
   As a jazzman and all-around musician, Rollins shines on
``Dancing in the Dark,'' demonstrating his mastery of bebop,
melodic ballads, toe-tapping dance tunes and music just to kick
back with.
