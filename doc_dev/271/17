<LEADPARA>  ON THE surface, it doesn't make sense. Why the sudden deluge of boxed sets
during a recession? Phil Spector, the Monkees, Fats Domino, King Crimson and
Bob Marley are among the latest acts to get boxed, while Aerosmith, Lynyrd
Skynyrd and Jeff Beck boxes are close behind. Since these are generally
high-ticket items selling for $30 to $60 apiece, isn't that a bit obscene
during tough times?;   No! the record industry is shouting.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The truth is that archival boxed sets are here to stay. Although they come
in multiple-CD packages that look costly to produce, they're often far more
profitable than single albums by new, unknown bands. Fans of new music can
gripe all they want about dollars being siphoned off by these dinosaur-band
boxes, but their pleas will fall on deaf ears.;   "Boxed sets make money. It's
as simple as that," says PolyGram's Bill Levenson, who won a Grammy for
producing Eric Clapton's "Crossroads" box.;   New acts get a break;   "These
sets pay the bills," adds Levenson. "And in a way, they can help new acts. The
profits allow record companies to take a chance on new acts that might have a
1-in-20 shot of making it. Obviously, if you put out a box on Crosby, Stills &amp;
Nash, you'll get a different audience than someone who buys into Jane's
Addiction. Chances are that many Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash fans are not into new
music. So you're not losing a sale. You're making a new sale.";   That logic
becomes more evident if you check the figures. A major record label typically
spends $200,000-$300,000, including video costs, to release an album by a new
act, of which the vast majority will flop. But boxed sets, since the music has
already been previously recorded, cost an average of $100,000, mostly for
remastering and the obligatory, magazine-like booklet. Promotion costs are
also low, since the acts are usually well-known and not in need of hype.;  
The lower overhead makes all the difference. "Once you've sold 10,000-20,000
units of a boxed set, you've recouped your money," says Levenson.;   The
numbers often far exceed that. Clapton's "Crossroads" has sold 600,000 copies
in three years. Bob Dylan's "Biograph," the 1985 package that started the
craze, has topped 500,000. But the biggest so far is Led Zeppelin's "Led
Zeppelin," with more than 750,000 sales since its release last year. Because a
record label typically makes $10 per box, the profits can be astronomical.;  
It doesn't take a crystal ball to see why many more boxes are on the way.
Levenson is working on a four-CD Moody Blues box for the spring. Elsewhere,
new boxes are coming within the month on Howlin' Wolf, Judy Garland, Chicago,
the Carpenters, Jimi Hendrix, Lou Reed and Les Paul.;   Another marketing ploy
-- double CDs as opposed to four-CD boxes -- is gaining momentum. Rhino
Records just released a double CD, "The Best of Alternative Rock," from MTV's
"120 Minutes" program. Featured tracks are by R.E.M., Sinead O'Connor and
Robyn Hitchcock. Recent double CDs from Quicksilver Messenger Service, Spirit
and Poco have hit the stores; and future double CDs are being mulled for
Fairport Convention, Free, Spooky Tooth and the Strawbs.;   The double CD is
for acts that don't have the material to justify the three-to-four-CD boxes.
They also come at an in-between price -- $20 to $30 -- to make them more
affordable. Some have sold briskly, such as Rush's "Chronicles," which has
moved 500,000 copies.;   Led Zep leads the way;   Of the larger format boxes,
the best so far are the aforementioned Zeppelin box (digitally remastered by
Zep's Jimmy Page, though there's only one previously unreleased track),
Dylan's "Bootleg Series" (the follow-up to "Biograph," it contains two dozen
previously unreleased acoustic takes), the Byrds' "The Byrds" (a generous
90-song set) and Little Richard's "The Specialty Sessions," containing some
hilarious studio repartee.;   Worth avoiding, however, are Jimi Hendrix's
"Lifelines," a haphazard collection that came out last year; and the Allman
Brothers' "Dreams," which has too many live tracks that have been heard on
other albums, along with some members' pre-Allman tunes that should have
stayed buried in the vaults. (Consumers must agree, because the Allmans' box
has sold 150,000 copies -- a disappointment for a group of such popularity.)
