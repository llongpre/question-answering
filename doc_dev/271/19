ROBERT HILBURN: GETTING HOOKED ON JANE

Don't be surprised if you hear about sightings of Black Flag's ghost around the 
John Anson Ford Theatre, where Jane's Addiction opened a seven-night stand 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The defunct Black Flag did more to define Los Angeles rock in the '80s than any 
group other than X and Motley Crue as it explored dark and unsettling themes 
with a visceral force that could be labeled truly frightening. 
</P>
<P>
While the independent South Bay outfit built a fiercely loyal, if unlikely, 
coalition of previously warring heavy metal and punk fans, it never moved 
beyond a cult status in rock. One reason is that it was considered simply too 
extreme by much of the pop-rock establishment. Its albums were all released on 
its own SST Records label. 
</P>
<P>
That was unfortunate, because Black Flag's live shows reflected such convincing 
alienation and rage that wide exposure -- say an arena tour -- would have 
pointed out to millions of young heavy metal fans just how toothless and hollow 
most of today's heavy metal or hard-rock heroes are. 
</P>
<P>
Black Flag's spirit was conjured up when hundreds of fans near the front of the 
Ford Theatre stage got so caught up in the fury of Jane's Addiction that they 
seemed like helpless figures in a human Mixmaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles quartet doesn't deal in the pure punk explosiveness of Black 
Flag, but there is an energy and aggression in the music that can be equally 
powerful. On a more global rock scale, the parallel suggested by the intensity 
level is Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
Don't, however, mistake the group for another Zeppelin clone such as Kingdom 
Come. There is originality and personality in the singing of Perry Farrell and 
in the tenacious rhythms of guitarist David Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins 
and bassist Eric A.. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it's not just the fierce beat that makes Jane's Addiction so absorbing. The 
group's best material on its "Nothing Shocking" album asks us to look at life 
through the twisted reflections of a broken mirror. 
</P>
<P>
One of the messages of the music is that it takes an extreme approach to break 
through the jaded consciousness of a world that has been desensitized at every 
turn by tabloid sensationalism. It's a condition outlined in "Ted, Just Admit 
It." Sample lines: Camera got them images / Camera got them all . . . / Showed 
me everybody / Naked and disfigured / Nothing's shocking. 
</P>
<P>
For all the fury in the music, the message of Jane's Addiction is quite 
traditional. Much of the anger is over the loss of integrity and values. 
</P>
<P>
"Had a Dad" is an impassioned statement of loss that, on its widest level, 
speaks about a world without order -- or even, perhaps, hope. Elsewhere, Jane's 
Addiction offers visions of comfort ("Summertime Rolls"), mixed with times of 
outrage ("Idiot's Rule") and periods of confusion ("Standing in the Shower . . 
. Thinking"). 
</P>
<P>
Even though the band -- especially the manic, colorfully attired Farrell 
(complete with magenta dreadlocks) -- didn't seem fully focused Thursday, the 
audience seemed caught up in the band's spell. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Black Flag, Jane's Addiction does enjoy the support of a major record 
company, Warner Bros., and it is making slow but solid progress in building a 
national audience. The group's debut album has sold approximately 200,000 
copies despite virtually no airplay. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's high point came when the band returned for the second encore to 
perform "Jane Says," a bittersweet tale of looking for love (and self-esteem) 
in all the wrong places. It's as poignant an '80s anthem of lost souls as David 
Bowie's "All the Young Dudes" and "Rebel, Rebel" were in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
If Jane's Addiction can come up with another song as elegant and as accessible 
on the next album, radio airplay may not be far away. If so, it may not be long 
before ghosts of Black Flag are seen around the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The sold-out Ford Theatre engagement is a sort of homecoming celebration, 
complete with a theme -- "El Ritual de la Habitual" -- and decorations (mostly 
religious statutes and photos) that gave the outdoor theater the feel of a 
weekend religious festival on Olvera Street. To add to the color, Jane's 
Addiction is using a different opening band each night. The engagement 
continues tonight, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and next Saturday.
