   Les Paul sat on a stool at a basement jazz club
on the Lower East Side, the fingers of his left hand cascading down
the neck of his guitar in soft, precise steps.
   At 73, the greatness of his guitar still draws laughs, sighs and
applause from audiences at Fat Tuesday's.
   For the past four years he and his three-piece group have been
playing clubs, performing the same mellow standards Paul has done
for decades. Some of them _ ``Via Con Dios,'' ``How High the Moon''
_ were songs made famous during his long partnership with his
ex-wife, the late singer Mary Ford, from whom he was divorced in
1962.
   Younger musical stars such as Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, Dire
Strait's Mark Knopfler and Dutch guitarist Eddie Van Halen come to
pay tribute and sit in with a musician who did it first and who
many believe still does it best.
   ``In my lifetime, the guitar hasn't changed enough to put in
your hat,'' Paul said, picking an imaginary guitar. ``Whether
you're Segovia or Van Halen, you can't do anything unless you can
do it here.''
   Paul, a musician-composer-designer-inventor, is the acknowledged
father of electronic music. In 1937, he became the first major
artist to play electric guitar when the 65 members of Fred Waring's
Pennsylvanians big band voted unanimously to let Paul play his
amplified contraption.
   ``Suddenly it was recognized that power was a very important
part of music,'' he said in an interview. ``To have the dynamics,
to have the way of expressing yourself beyond the normal limits of
an unamplified instrument, was incredible. Today a guy wouldn't
think of singing a song on a stage without a microphone and a sound
system.
   ``But today, there are a lot of parents who blame Les Paul for
all the racket going on in their basement,'' he said with a smile,
a reference to the thousands of teen-agers whose love affair with
the guitar is expressed in decibels.
   For seven years in the 1950s, Paul and Ford broadcast a TV show
from their home in Mahwah, N.J., which the Listerine Co. _ sponsor
of the show _ bought for the couple to get them to move to New
Jersey from California.
   It was with Ford that Paul developed two-track recording, known
today as dubbing, a process that revolutionized recording in the
'40s and is the backbone of studio work today.
   The guitar that bears his name, the Les Paul, is a legend in its
own right made by the Gibson Co. of Nashville. The list of rock and
fusion jazz musicians who choose to play it reads like a who's who
of modern popular music: blues master B.B. King, Pete Townsend of
The Who, Steve Howe of Yes, jazz great Al DiMeola, Led Zeppelin's
Page and Paul McCartney, who with Paul's help designed his own
custom version of the guitar.
   In turn, two generations of aspiring guitarists have saved their
money for Les Pauls. The most popular model today sells for between
$800 and $900.
   It is the Les Pauls' bigger, ``fatter'' sound that attracted
musicians back in the late '50s, when the first of the classically
inspired guitars was produced. The Les Pauls' innovation was the
use of two, double-coiled pick-ups that reduced the twang of other
guitars and gave the musician a broader range of sounds as the
change the tone or volume on each pick-up.
   Paul Jernigan, Gibson's marketing director, said sales figures
for the guitar are kept confidential but the 12 Les Paul models
continue to grow in popularity and the company now has six months
worth of back orders.
   The instrument's main competition for nearly two decades has
been the Fender Stratocaster, a lighter guitar with a dramatic
molded body. The Stratocaster, or Strat, as it is commonly known,
has its own claim on guitar aristocracy: Jimi Hendrix played a
Strat (and burned several on stage); Eric Clapton and Robin Trower
both prefer the Fenders.
   Ironically, Paul said, most kids these days know what a Les Paul
is, but not who he is. He also has mixed feelings about today's
rock 'n' roll and the way his guitar is now being used. He hates
distortion and electronic gimmicks. ``They're just ways of hiding
what the guitarist can't do with these,'' he said, wiggling his
fingers.
   ``The first rock stuff, I mean in the early '60s, it was bad _
bad singers, bad players, bad everything. But they went from three
chords on guitar and by 1988 we now have some fantastic musicians
in all fields. There are some kids who can go into a music store
and pick up a guitar today and play anything; it's shocking.''
   But one thing Paul has not done is stop learning.
   Gibson has agreed to market a ``super-guitar'' he is now
designing, which he said would sell for nearly $35,000. He also is
expecting a visit from McCartney at Fat Tuesday's for a
performance, though a date has not been set.
   ``You can do anything in music as long as you can think it up,''
he said. ``That's a very exciting thing.''
