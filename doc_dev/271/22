Nope, this isn't it. 
</P>
<P>
Former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant still hasn't come up with that macho, 
hard-rock album Zep fans have been waiting for since the band called it quits a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
His solo albums -- this is his fifth since 1982 -- are like public dress 
rehearsals for the real thing. His last one, 1988's "Now and Zen," was a 
disjointed, dissonant mess, wandering all over the place. The new one is more 
focused -- with guitars a stronger force than usual -- but some of the pieces 
still seem cluttered and aimless, tottering on quirky rhythmic structures. 
</P>
<P>
Plant is apparently still experimenting, seeking a new niche. Meanwhile, he 
keeps Zep fans salivating with numbers, like "Nirvana," that have tantalizing 
echoes of good old Zep. The album's best song is a remake of Kenny Dino's 1961 
hit, "Your Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night," mainly because it's 
fairly close in spirit and feel to old Zep tunes. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for Plant to stop pussyfooting around, come to terms with whatever he 
has to come to terms with and make that good, hard-rocking, Zep-style album 
that's obviously lurking inside, clamoring to get out. 
</P>

C'mon Robert, we're getting tired of waiting. Dennis Hunt
