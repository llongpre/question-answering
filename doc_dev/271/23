Record companies have been unusually slow in releasing noteworthy new product 
in 1990, so we'll take advantage of the lull to reach back to 1989 for two 
year-end albums by artists whose impact has only begun to be felt: Soundgarden 
and Daniel Lanois. The $25 Guide outlines how to keep up with what's fresh in 
pop music on a record budget of $25 a month (about $45 for CD buyers).

Jungle Brothers' "Done by the Forces of Nature" (Warner Bros.) -- Not quite as 
pop-minded nor dramatic an expansion of rap's boundaries as De La Soul's 
wonderfully eclectic "3 Feet High and Rising," but still an enticing 
demonstration of the imagination and range of rap. Like "3 Feet," "Forces" is 
an especially inviting starting point for those pop fans who still maintain 
they can't stand rap.

Daniel Lanois' "Acadie" (Opal/Warner Bros.) -- Working with U2, Bob Dylan, 
Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson established Lanois as one of the most 
respected record producers of the late '80s. In his own solo debut, Lanois 
demonstrates that he may be one of the most rewarding singer-songwriters of the 
early '90s. There isn't the epic scope here you find in U2's "The Joshua Tree" 
or Gabriel's "So," but these gentle explorations of life's mysteries and beauty 
are framed in ethnic and roots-conscious styles (including Cajun and blues) 
that echo the soulful purity of Ry Cooder and the artists whose works Lanois 
has produced.

<P>
Soundgarden's "Louder Than Love" (A&amp;M) -- From a distance, it's to easy to 
dismiss this Seattle outfit as just one more hard-rock band that is trying to 
reap the rewards of the rock world's continuing craving for another Led 
Zeppelin. What makes Soundgarden worth further inspection is that the quartet 
realizes the important thing isn't duplicating the Zeppelin sound (remember 
Kingdom Come's fate?), but reaching for the intensity reflected in the primal 
screams of Zeppelin's most persuasive moments. Another reason for the quartet's 
enormous potential is that the group doesn't tend to be retrospective. Like 
Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden is racing to the future.

John Wesley Harding's "Here Comes the Groom" (Sire/Reprise) -- This young 
British singer-songwriter may have borrowed his stage name from an old Bob 
Dylan album title and some of his musical direction from Elvis Costello, but 
his songs about human relationships and values carry a satire, wit and 
compassion that make this the first great album of the '90s. He kicks off a 
series of Southern California shows Wednesday at the Coach House.

<P>
They Might Be Giants' "Flood" (Elektra) -- The duo -- John Flansburgh and John 
Linnell -- is a pop-rock rarity: They write satire without a trace of smugness. 
The songs, about serious topics and loony ones, combine some of the ironic, 
poignant and biting edges associated with such diverse spirits as Ray Davies 
and Tom Lehrer. A feast of pop-rock imagination. 
</P>
<P>
3rd Bass' "The Cactus Album" (Def Jam) -- Where the Beastie Boys forged a 
merger of punk, metal and rap, the second white group to catch fire in rap 
sticks fairly close to a hard-core rap style, mirroring more of the hip-hop 
authority of De La Soul's "Me Myself and I" than the crossover dreams of the 
Beasties' "Fight for Your Right (to Party)." There are some creative lapses on 
Side 1, but Side 2 kicks in with one of the most consistent half-hours of any 
rap album. Besides, how could you not warm up to a group that opens Side 1 with 
a nod to "Our Gang" and closes Side 2 with a wink to Abbott and Costello?
