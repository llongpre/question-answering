History: Steele hooked up with German-born Pipien in Atlanta two years ago. 
After dropping out of college to concentrate on music, the duo recruited Hall 
and found Lindenbaum through an ad begging release from heavy-metal monotony. 
Taking its name from a religious tract, Mary My Hope made a distinctive mark in 
the Atlanta scene, eventually drawing the attention of Andrew Lauder, the 
former head of England's Demon Records (who originally signed Elvis Costello). 
Lauder signed the group to his new, RCA-distributed Silvertone label. M.M.H. 
recorded its debut album, "Museum," in Wales with producer Hugh Jones (Echo 
&amp; the Bunnymen). The band recently toured America with Jane's Addiction.

Sound: Taking the stairway to arena rock heaven, Mary My Hope is a true acolyte 
of rock mythology; its more thundering moments reveal the fall-out of 
devotional hours spent listening to the Doors, Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, 
AC/DC, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and even INXS. These might be diverse-style 
icons, but Mary My Hope has no problem with stylistic purity. Though capable of 
blistering, straight-ahead rockers ("Hourglass"), the group has a predilection 
toward epic drama-songs such as the band's signature, "Suicide King," which 
rises from a plaintive acoustic opening to a sonic meltdown, complete with 
crashing walls of chords and Hall's Robert Plant-like wailing. Thematically the 
group runs the gamut of what Steele describes as "optimistic nihilism," with 
lots of crypto-mystical musings about spiritual salvation and death. Still 
young and naive enough (the oldest band member is 23) to trim the fat off 
dinosaur art-rock leftovers, Mary My Hope stands poised between metallic 
rapture and an unholy mess.
