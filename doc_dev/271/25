Wow, Kingdom Come's second album almost doesn't sound like Led Zeppelin! If the 
band starts to Zep out, singer Lenny Wolf tones down the Robert Plant stylings. 
If Wolf gets a little Plant-ish, then the music pulls back on the Zep vibe. In 
places, the group even sounds more like AC/DC! Seriously, though, this record 
does take a step up from the quintet's debut, which sold a ton but brought the 
band ridicule for being a total Zep clone. On a couple of songs here -- 
"Perfect 'O' " and the hypnotic "Gotta Go" -- Kingdom Come shows that it's 
starting to learn how to blend its own heavy-handed personality with its 
influences. JANISS GARZA
