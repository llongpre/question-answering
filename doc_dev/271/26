<LEADPARA>  THE members of Van Halen aren't the kind of guys you'd lump in with such
all-star father figures as Robert Young and Fred MacMurray.;   They are hard
rockers whose songs are filled with locomotive rhythms and Black &amp; Decker
power chords, whose lyrics contain more sexual double-entendre than a junior
high locker room. They titled their new album "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge,"
and their in-house production company is called Yssup. (Those of you who know
acronyms and anagrams will understand.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But last March, guitarist Edward Van Halen became the last band member to
become a daddy when his wife, actress Valerie Bertinelli, gave birth to baby
Wolfgang (honest). Talk to them, and these guys are as happy to brandish
photos and gush over first steps as they are to talk about their music. And
they say they can do so without sacrificing their rock 'n' roll credibility.; 
 "The way I look at it, rock 'n' roll is music. It's not groupies and
partying," says Edward Van Halen, 34. "If people think you have to be a junkie
or a drunk or be with a different chick every night to be rock 'n' roll, I
think they're wrong.";   But singer Sammy Hagar, who has sons ages 21 and 7,
is quick to crow that he does wild and "stupid things." Most recently it was
getting pulled over for pushing his Ferrari to 155 mph -- with his wife and
youngest son in the car -- on the way from their Bay Area home to Los
Angeles.;   In the controversy-laden world of Guns N' Roses -- where drugs,
concert riots and politically incorrect lyrics are de rigueur -- driving fast
is hardly an eyebrow-raising vice. In fact, it's comparatively boring. But Van
Halen has learned that a little adult mellowing hasn't dented its popularity.;
  "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge" hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts during its
first week of release, and stayed there for three weeks. It's still in the Top
10 and has sold almost 2 million copies so far. And in a soft summer for the
concert business, tickets for the quartet's shows have been selling out in
minutes.;   During the past 13 years of recording, these have become expected
accomplishments for Van Halen -- Hagar, Eddie Van Halen, brother Alex Van
Halen and Michael Anthony.;   "Our fans are just there," says Hagar, 44, who
joined in 1986 to replace original singer David Lee Roth. "It's not because
I'm arrogant; we just know they're there.";   Indeed, each Van Halen album has
done better than the one before; the last three topped the charts in
progressively shorter spans of time. Thanks to that consistently building
audience, Van Halen has achieved rock stalwart stature, right up there with
such groups as Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith.;   Still, there was cause for some
concern before the new album's release. The last time Van Halen was visible
was 1988, when it released the album "OU812" and staged the ambitious and
elaborate "Monsters of Rock" tour with four other hard-rock acts. The tour was
a struggle, with many dates losing money. "OU812" was a solid multimillion
seller, but its overall impact was light, generally defined by such slick pop
hits as "When It's Love.";   The group kept a low profile after that,
surfacing for a short tour in 1989 and for last year's opening of the Cabo
Wabo Cantina club near the California-Mexico border.;   In the meantime, a new
generation of hard-rock acts grabbed the spotlight: the controversial Guns N'
Roses, upstarts Skid Row and Warrant, and "Monsters of Rock" mate Metallica,
whose granite sound made Van Halen's recent hits sound like pebbles in
comparison.;   Pretty formidable competition, right?;   "Come on," says Eddie
Van Halen. "There's plenty of room for everybody. Music is not a competitive
thing. It's not like running a race. It's impossible to compete with another
band; the only way you can compete with another musician is if he's your twin.
(Guns' guitarist) Slash plays a lot different than I do; so how can I compete
with a guy who doesn't play like I do?";   Still, "For Unlawful . . ." is a
mostly molten record -- perhaps the hardest since Hagar joined the band. From
Alex Van Halen's opening thuds on "Poundcake" to Eddie Van Halen's
tweeter-piercing guitar licks on "Runaround" and "Right Now," the group sounds
determined to revive its head-banging credentials.;   The musicians partially
credit coproducer Andy Johns, a former Led Zeppelin collaborator, with
improving the album's sonic attack. And Hagar claims the group's own drive
wasn't necessarily competitive but the result of time off. "We took a year
off, completely off," he says. "When you come back after a year off, the first
thing you want to do is . . . crank.";   "Whatever we do, people always ask,
'Was this conscious?' " Eddie Van Halen adds. "Nothing we do is really
planned. I personally don't know where music comes from. You don't sit down
and say, 'Hey guys, we should write a song like this.' You don't do that. We
start jamming and playing until we say, 'Hey, that's kind of neat.' We work on
the neat stuff and dump the rest.";   For the new album, Van Halen has dumped
the single as part of its approach, perhaps conscious that its pop success was
diluting its rock image. Though there will be videos for individual songs such
as "Poundcake" and "Top of the World" -- NASA has invited the group to use the
space shuttle for the latter -- the group will not release those songs as
singles.;   "We're trying to say we're not a pop band," Hagar explains. "We'll
tell radio, 'This is the song we're going to make a video for,' so they can
play it if they want. But we won't ask our fans to go out and buy a 45 or try
to make the pop charts.";   "It's intentional. We're a rock band. We don't
have to release singles."; Van Halen; With Alice in Chains; Where: Shoreline
