<HEAD>Top Soviet Heavy Metal Rockers Play First Concert in West</HEAD>

   Back in the Soviet Union, the five young
Moscow rockers who make up Black Coffee rank as the nation's
premier heavy metal heroes, boasting the country's two best-selling
rock records.
   But if a recent concert in Madrid _ their first in the West _ is
any indication, their Western counterparts need not worry about
developing strategic defenses.
   The group, led by energetic frontman and singer Dmitri
Varshavsky, 24, managed to attract an audience of 2,000 in the
large open-air stadium where they played a deafening hour-long set.
Their soundman had asked Spanish officials for political asylum
earlier in the day.
   The rock critic of the daily Diario 16 condescendingly described
their music as ``orthodox.''
   In concert, however, the group generated sparks from die-hard,
leather-garbed rock fans, mainly through Varshavsky's
irrespressible screams and growls, reminiscent of Ozzy Osborne or
the Australian heavy metal group AC@DC, and the inspired pounding
of drummer Sergei Chernyakov, 29.
   In the Soviet Union, the group is responsible for the two
top-selling rock recordings: the album ``Over the Threshold'' and
the four-song disc ``Black Coffee,'' both recorded last year, group
manager Ovanes Melik-Pashaev said in an interview.
   After the Spanish gig, he said, Black Coffee has set its sights
on other countries, especially the United States, and is rehearsing
songs in English to record and perform in the West.
   Melik-Pashaev said he is talking with a Dallas promoter called
Sovitex, Inc. to arrange a U.S. tour this summer to include stops
in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco and perhaps Chicago and
Washington.
   Despite his pre-concert claims that Black Coffee plays ``melodic
hard-rock with touches of heavy metal thrown in,'' on stage the
group's grinding, ear-splitting, double-lead guitar attack sounded
similar to aggressive Western bands such as Def Lepard.
   But unlike Western bands that spout tough lyrics and glamorize
violent attitudes, Black Coffee promotes ``peace, friendship and
happiness,'' singer Varshavsky said through an interpreter.
   ``Our songs are very optimistic. They speak of the struggle
between good and evil, with good triumphing over bad,'' he said.
   Melik-Pashaev said there was no censorship of lyrics but added
the group doesn't like to use offensive words ``or the language of
criminals.''
   Varshavsky said the group has not been influenced by any
particular Western band but expressed admiration for Black Sabbath,
Led Zeppelin and Whitesnake.
   Melik-Pashaev described the group's repertoire as ``rock for
peace'' that stays clear of political references.
   ``But rock is a social phenomenon, so in an indirect way the
group can't help but be political,'' the manager said.
   The high point of the concert came during the obligatory drum
solo, which went on for six minutes and stirred the crowd to chant
in unison.
   Other members of the group are Sergui Kudishin, 29, lead guitar;
Igor Kupriyanov, 24, bass guitar; and Igor Andreev, 23, rhythm
guitar.
   The group was formed in December 1986. Since then, it has gone
from playing clubs in Moscow to recording for the state-run
Melodiya label, touring the Soviet Union and frequent appearances
on the Soviet television youth shows ``The Look '' and ``Tomorrow's
Mail.''
   The group appeared in Madrid at the invitation of the municipal
government which promoted the concert as part of the city's annual
festival in honor of St. Isidro the Laborer, the city's patron
saint.
   Madrid police said 38-year-old soundman Samouil Savitsky's
request for political asylum had been granted on a provisional
basis. Speaking through the interpreter, members of the group said
they didn't understand his action but did not elaborate.
   J. Perez de Albeniz, rock critic for Spain's leading daily, the
left-of-center El Pais, had nothing but harsh words for
Melik-Peshaev, saying he didn't let the musicians speak freely to
reporters. The critic wrote that the manager ``was a master of the
art of talking without saying anything.''
   Melik-Pashev, a serious, black-bearded 38-year-old, said the
group's success was due as much to the policies of ``glasnost''
(openness) and ``perestroika'' (economic restructuring) championed
by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as to its music.
   He said some 5,000 rock groups had emerged in the Soviet Union
in the last two years, and Melodiya is doing more rock recording
and giving the Soviet rockers a greater opportunity to obtain
instruments, especially highly coveted Fender and Gibson guitars.
   Some of the American instruments cost $2,000, he said, but
cheaper copies have become easier to acquire at secondhand music
shops.
   The group's stage show is austere by Western standards. Bassist
Kupriyanov, by far the fanciest dresser, showed off his black
Michael Jackson-like military jacket embroidered in gold and swung
the gold epaulets from side to side while running to and fro on
stage.
