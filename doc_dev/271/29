<LEADPARA>  NOBODY rides the musical currents more confidently than the Australian band
INXS.;    When it was hip to be tagged "modern" -- dark and sensual and more
than a little odd -- INXS (pronounced IN-exCESS) gladly filled the bill with
their promise of "Original Sin."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When MTV focused excessively on hard-rock bands with charismatic front men,
INXS kicked up the screaming guitar solos. And shaggy lead singer Michael
Hutchence came out of the shadows -- a "New Sensation" with a pouty, sexy
insolence said to drive women wild.;    That moody persona also has served him
OK in films -- playing a Jim Morrison-like stoner in "Dogs in Space" and the
poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in Roger Corman's odd "Frankenstein Unbound.";   
Nowadays it seems only the most rhythmic rockers can get a shot on
dance-crazed, contemporary-hits radio stations. INXS has done the deed,
cutting a funky groove through Top 40-ville with "Suicide Blonde" and
"Disappear" from its current album "X.";    The truth, though, is that INXS
hasn't really had to change that much to fit the tastes of the hour or any
narrow-programming niche, Hutchence says. Since their origins as the Farriss
Brothers in Sydney, Australia, 14 years ago, this sextet has always embraced
both rock and dance impulses, a lot of passion and a tad of protest, the
mainstream and the minor -- one style twist from Column A, one from Column B.;
   Normally, INXS practices everything in moderation, suggests its lead
singer. "Here in the states, rock stations don't like music that's black, and
black stations have a hard time with rock," Hutchence says. "Where we were
growing up, there wasn't a line between rock and soul and pop and funk or
anything. Australia doesn't have an enormous population, so the media . . .
cater to everybody at once. So we listened to Led Zeppelin and James Brown on
the same radio station, thinking that good music is good music, whatever its
type.";    Of late, Hutchence has been dipping even deeper into the well,
scooping up everything from the modern serial music of Stockhausen to
traditional country blues.;    "The last couple of weeks I've been listening
to John Lee Hooker and Robert Johnson," Hutchence says. "Their music is so
powerful, so brilliant, so smooth and slinky. The white boys got it wrong.
They think you have to scream all the time to be sexy.";    Hutchence asks,
"Why pretend you're rock and roll, when it's really pop in drag? Like the
Nelson brothers or Poison. More like the antidote, really."  </TEXT>
