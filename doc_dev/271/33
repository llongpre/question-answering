<LEADPARA>  THE art rock band Yes has always played to extremes.;    At its worst, its
shows were bombastic, overwrought and lifeless.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But at its best, Yes has pushed rock to its limits with a mystical and
intelligent mix of influences including classical composition, free-form jazz,
English folk and straight-ahead rock 'n' roll.;    Luckily, that's what the
audience at the Oakland Coliseum Arena got for three hours Friday night -- a
greatest-hits show that broke the rules. This was not only the best show Yes
has played in at least a decade, it had more life and creativity than recent
reunions by the Rolling Stones, the Who or Paul McCartney.;    Two bands
combined;  You might have expected this one to fail: For one thing, it wasn't
a traditional reunion. These eight musicians had never performed together
before as Yes, but rather as two bands with the same name.;    There was the
Yes of the 1970s, led by classically trained guitarist Steve Howe, which
played half-hour orchestral jams such as "Tales from Topographic Oceans." Howe
was later replaced by producer and guitarist Trevor Rabin, who led the group
into a pop phase with such short radio hits as "Owner of a Lonely Heart.";   
Friday's show combined both types of music from a slowly revolving stage set
at the arena's center. The musicians from both bands meshed well, inspiring
each other to go further. They played pop, they played longer jams and they
pulled out some material they have never played live.;    All music, no
gimmicks;  The focus was on the music. There were no lasers or theatrics.;   
There was Howe stretching out on the show opener "Yours is No Disgrace,"
changing the tempo and mood with a jazzy improvised guitar solo. He prowled
the stage like Neil Young, while Rabin played backup with a wah-wah pedal.;   
Rabin took center stage with up-tempo rockers "Rhythm of Love" and "Owner of a
Lonely Heart." And they both soared on "And You and I.";    They weren't the
only opposites who found a way to interact. No drummers have more varied
styles than Alan White and Bill Bruford.;    White -- whose drumming was
immortalized on John Lennon's "Instant Karma" -- is one of rock's best
straight-ahead players. Bruford, who used to play with King Crimson, plays a
more offbeat style, sort of like Senegalese space music.;    As the stage
revolved you could hear one drummer fade into the other -- one of the few
times that two drummers sounded far better than one good one.;    Extended
solos;  The group kept up one of its best traditions, letting each musician
play solo or in pairs for 10 minutes each. They interspersed these quiet
breaks with longer and louder songs, including "I've Seen All Good People" and
"Heart of the Sunrise.";    Rabin, who just became an U.S. citizen two days
earlier, borrowed a page from Howe and played acoustic guitar for a kind of
jazz improvisation based on the "Star Spangled Banner.";    It was the most
unusual version of the song since Jimi Hendrix's -- and it was hauntingly
beautiful. Singer John Anderson also picked up a guitar and used his solo set
to show how he wrote "Long Distance Runaround" 20 years ago.;    They tried to
make this more than a show of greatest hits, expanding their set list. One of
the biggest surprises was that they dropped "Starship Trooper," which is like
Led Zeppelin failing to play "Stairway to Heaven.";    Instead, they played a
half-hour version of "Awakening" from the 1977 album "Going for the One," an
overlooked song with a Pink Floyd feel that was as powerful as any of their
better-known classics.  </TEXT>
