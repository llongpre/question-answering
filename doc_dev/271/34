   ``Let's talk about love,'' Robert Plant says on
the opening track of his newest album. And so he does.
   ``Manic Nirvana'' is full of reflections on love: physical love,
fantasy love, love gone sour. But don't expect the usual, or the
serious, from this rock veteran.
   He's always been known as the master of capricious naughtiness
and musical wackiness, but his solo efforts since the breakup of
Led Zeppelin in 1980 have been relatively tame. No more.
   On ``Manic Nirvana,'' Plant returns to playfully sexual lyrics
liberally sprinkled with wit and innuendo, and blended with
abundant puns.
   In ``Big Love,'' he juxtaposes a romantic encounter with being
at ``15,000 and holding'' on an airplane. He imagines a
relationship with a magazine model in the frustrated ``I Cried.''
And in what is probably his most accessible song to date, ``Hurting
Kind (I've Got My Eyes on You),'' Plant moans over his love just
like old times.
   The album also contains the first acoustic song of his solo
career, ``Liars Dance,'' a quiet but terse commentary on greed and
religion.
   And as always, Plant rejoices in keeping his audience guessing.
In his remake of the 1961 Kenny Dino song, ``Your Ma Said You Cried
in Your Sleep Last Night,'' he slips in the first two verses of the
Zeppelin classic ``Black Dog'' _ just to keep you on your toes.
   ``(The music) must change and it must give me the variety and
the humor and the pomp and the mock splendor and all that sort of
thing, depending upon the mood that I'm in,'' Plant said in an
interview.
   The constant changing makes his music difficult to categorize _
and he likes it that way. But he teasingly called it ``angst-pomp.''
   ``Part of the reason that I change it so much is to be quirky
and to maintain the quirk,'' he said. ``It certainly doesn't help
me sell more records. In fact, if it does anything at all, it
diminishes the chance, because I'm not playing the natural,
straight-down-the-line, middle-of-the-road game.''
   That sense of humor has helped Plant to make himself less
serious. ``There are parts of my personality that need a lot of
tender loving care and attention from myself to myself,'' he said,
``and there are other parts that really are very flippant and have
to be a bit derisive.
   ``I'm serious because I want to make this music sound exactly as
it does now, but at the same time, I can't be too serious about it
because there are so many holes in it and there's such folly in a
rock n' roll singer's ego.''
   It seems that Plant can now accept the strutting, bare-chested
attitude of his youth and temper it with the cleverness and
imagination of maturity. But despite his 42 years, he is by no
means a prude.
   He's called his new album ``thunder and lightning condensed in a
condom.'' In other words, it's lusty. But it gets its sexiness from
Plant's fantasies and double entendre, rather than blatant
vulgarity.
   In ``Big Love,'' he talks of a bathroom rendezvous aboard an
airplane. ``I just felt that it was fair game because it's
something that everybody dreams of happening, even if you have the
most straight-laced, moralistic point of view,'' he said.
   However, he said he's not out to exploit or degrade women. ``You
have to be careful not to take it as if I'm heralding male
dominance and it's only for my benefit. Everybody would benefit
from those sort of impromptu meetings.''
   Plant wistfully spoke of his ``complete incapacity to have a
nice, calm love affair.'' He quoted from his song ``She Said,''
which he said describes him:
   ``So I say, `Give me fresh horses, let me ride the wild beat.
Women in their houses, I can't deal with their heat.'''
   ``I like the seduction,'' he said. ``I like the kind of intrigue
of relationships and I don't like what they do to me _ or what I do
to them.''
   Part of Plant's new musical freedom has come from his band,
formed before the release of ``Now and Zen.'' Guitarist Doug Boyle,
bassist Charlie Jones, keyboardist Phil Johnstone and drummer Chris
Blackwell are roughly 20 years younger than their leader. But Plant
said his outlook keeps him young.
   ``I think my attitude is my Fountain of Youth, with or without a
band, because I feel kind of timeless,'' he said.
   ``I know I'm getting older, but I don't think that's affecting
my state of mind. I surround myself with young guys because they're
keen and they're excited and their contribution to everything is
very wholehearted. That marriage of enthusiasm and lack of cynicism
and lack of worldly over-wisdom _ it's perfect for me.''
   As Plant's personality is a combination of adult wisdom and
youthful energy, so are his heroes. He is a devotee of early
bluesmen Howlin' Wolf and Gene Vincent, but said he admired anyone
``who could swing their hips and make me wonder what that meant.''
He also praised Robert Smith of The Cure.
   Of the wide variety of his heroes, he quipped: ``Some of them
are dead, some of them are tired, and some of them are young.''
   Plant's 1990 tour kicks off in Europe on May 1 and should be in
the States shortly after.
   ``I'm very lucky,'' he said. ``I have a particularly strong live
following and I haven't had huge Top 40 hits, but I've got a pretty
big, interested, live following, which is great _ it's kind of
greater than if I'd had Top 40 hits and nothing else.''
