<LEADPARA>  WHEN Rolling Stone editors listed two Richard Thompson albums in their top 100
of the past 20 years, it must have shocked people to see this relatively
unknown performer alongside the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and
Michael Jackson.;    But it wouldn't have surprised anyone who saw his show at
the Warfield on Wednesday night.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Thompson showed the packed house songwriting and performing skills that
come together about as rarely as a solar eclipse. And his talents are even
more appreciated because he plays the Bay Area far too infrequently.;    His
two-hour electric and acoustic set was majestic, just perfect -- the kind of
rock 'n roll that combined the best of the 1960s with the best of the 1990s.; 
  And it wasn't just Thompson's set that had people talking. Opener Shawn
Colvin, who sang in a style reminiscent of an older Joni Mitchell, was brought
back for an encore after a standing ovation, rare for a first act. (Her first
album, "Steady On," won a Grammy this year for best contemporary folk
recording.) She soloed 45 minutes on acoustic guitar before joining Thompson's
band for his set.;    For the uninitiated, this 42-year-old Englishman is sort
of Britain's version of Robbie Robertson and the Band, back when they were
doing songs like "The Weight," "Chest Fever" and "Stage Fright.";   
Thompson's songs are just as distinct and powerful. You hear them only once
and you come out singing them. But he is just as well known for his guitar
playing, which combines Mark Knopfler's strong melodic lines with Eddie Van
Halen's pyrotechnics.;    Thompson gave this audience a taste of everything,
mixing harder hitting electric numbers with acoustic ballads. He and Colvin
did the kind of lilting harmonies that he used to do with his ex-wife, Linda,
on the albums that brought him recognition.;    Two rocking electric numbers
from his new album "Rumor and Sigh" opened the show. "Read About Love" and
"Backlash Love Affair" showcased a five-person backup band featuring John
Sherman on the most heavy-metal accordion I've heard.;    Thompson played
almost every song on the new album, alternating them with older ones,
including "Gypsy Love Songs," "Valerie," "Tear Stained Letter" (which has
become an American country music hit for several groups), and "Wall of Death,"
the best song ever written about a roller coaster.;    He also played an
English classic, "Shady Grove," that was a standard in the days he was the
lead guitarist for Fairport Convention. Only this time, he exchanged leads
with Sherman on accordion, probably the only time an accordion has gone single
note-for-note with a guitar on a rock song.;    There also was a curve on his
hardest rocker, "Shoot Out the Lights," when Thompson let his screeching
guitar go neck and neck with Pete Zorn on mandolin.;    Besides the surprising
instruments and solos, the main thing Thompson brings to his concerts is an
incredible sense of timing. He uses the silences in the same way Bruce
Springsteen does, to make potent statements.;    A dead pause before each
chorus of "Shoot Out the Lights" hits like a shock. The break is as powerful
as a drumbeat.;    His fans paid the best kind of respect, keeping pin-drop
silent during ballads and getting rowdy with the rockers. Between songs, they
yelled requests and he joked with them.;    "You're going to get famous," one
yelled.;    "I don't want to be famous," replied Thompson. "I just want to be
notorious.";    He was.  </TEXT>
