   Born of an odd mixture of 1970s funk, punk
rock, rap, California surf, skateboard and hippie cultures, a wild
musical genre called ``thrash funk'' has swept the San Francisco
club scene.
   The area that gave rise to acid rock in the 1960s is now the
nation's hotbed of the colorful, youth-driven ``punk-funk,'' and
the record industry is ready to cash in.
   ``If any of these bands break through, you are going to have the
entire industry swooping down on San Francisco to scoop up what
they can find,'' said John Axelrod, director of artist and
repertoire for RCA Records in Los Angeles.
   Inspired largely by George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic era,
bands such as Psychefunkapus, Limbomaniacs, Primus, The Smoking
Section and Fungo Mungo make up a diverse musical scene linked by
seething energy, a thumping bass, sometimes bawdy lyrics and a
sense of humor.
   ``It's about intensity, which is always a good rock 'n' roll
standard,'' said Butthouse, lead singer and bassist for
Limbomaniacs.
   Band members dismiss the label ``thrash-funk'' as confining,
confusing and misleading, and cite an array of influences led by
Clinton and augmented by James Brown, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, Frank
Zappa and Led Zeppelin.
   ``To me, each of these bands is completely different than the
others,'' said Psychefunkapus bassist Atom Ellis. ``Primus is
really hard-edged. Fungo Mungo is more like James Brown meets the
Red Hot Chile Peppers. Limbomaniacs are more of a go-go kind of
thing. Smoking Section is a really smooth groove band. It's hard to
say what we are.''
   Despite the diversity, the so-called ``punk funksters'' seem to
admire one another's music. And there's a street style of long
hair, tattoos and muscular physiques shared by some of the band
members and many of their fans.
   Axelrod signed Psychefunkapus in late 1989 when he worked at
Atlantic Records, and plans to soon sign The Smoking Section to
RCA. He says the bands present a wholly American sound that
embodies San Francisco's liberal past.
   ``These are pseudo-hippies,'' he said. ``It's another evolution
of what the psychedelic movement was about in the first place _
free love and peace, addressing the issues but remembering we are
here to have a good time.''
   The scene appears to have evolved almost by mistake, coming on
the heels of the late 1980s success of Los Angeles groups The Red
Hot Chile Peppers and Fishbone. Both are widely seen as progenitors
of the funk-influenced thrash genre, although San Francisco
musicians distance themselves from such bands.
   ``It seems like every one of these aggregate groups started on
their own, with little influence from the others,'' said David
Hawkins, drummer of The Smoking Section. ``We came in a little
later, but we'd never seen them or heard them until we got billed
with them.''
   Primus and the Limbomaniacs came first, standing today as the
bands with the strongest instrumental skills and the most funny and
raunchy lyrics. Both have recorded albums on independent labels.
   Six-year-old Primus, led by comical bassist-singer Les Claypool,
is the thrashiest of the thrash-funk bands.
   After some personnel changes, the band released a self-pressed
live album called ``Suck on This.'' Four years of talks with Geffen
Records failed to produce results, and the band produced its first
studio album, ``Frizzle Fry,'' on the New York-based Caroline label.
   Psychefunkapus was the first San Francisco punk funk band to
sign with a big label. Their Atlantic debut is in the Top 10 on the
college charts, with more than 28,000 albums sold, including about
8,000 in Dallas. The Marin County-based band represents the
psychedelic wing of the genre, a funk sound mixed with rap, reggae
and acid rock.
   The Limbomaniacs go heavy on Washington-rooted go-go street
music, rap and funk. The band's debut album is due out soon on
Relativity Records, with Bootsy Collins, of Clinton's
Parliament-Funkadelic, singing on the opening track, ``Butt
Funkin'.''
   The thrash-funk audience is a heavily white, male crowd. The
beat lures listeners to the dance floor. Braver souls head to the
core of the throbbing, slam-dancing mob, where people are pushed
and shoved, almost against the grain of the music, and some dive or
are thrown at the stage.
   ``This is music that has found its root in live performance,''
said Creighton Burke, manager of Psychefunkapus. ``A lot of the old
1970s rock created record sales out of the live performance. The
New York Dolls, the (Grateful) Dead, Hendrix _ those bands created
album sales through live performance.''
   Fungo Mungo started three years ago as a ``punk-fusion'' band,
later integrating a funk-style bass.
   ``We all loved heavy rock bands from the 1970s: Black Sabbath,
AC-DC. I love disco,'' said bassist Arion Salazar, 19, of Fungo
Mungo. ``Now, I love KC and Sunshine Band. I used to hate them. It
was so cheesy. You're eight years old and you see a bunch of guys
with big bell bottoms jumping around. ... In hindsight, that was
what was cool. It's kind of neat now.''
