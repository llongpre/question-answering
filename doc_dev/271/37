I would dread the times my father would walk through the door after work and 
tell my mother, "Margaret, I'm feeling frisky tonight." They would push aside 
the furniture in the parlor, and put on a Glenn Miller Orchestra record 
featuring saxophonist and singer Tex Beneke.

Then, they would dance right there in front of us. They called it "cutting the 
rug." We called it nauseating. It got to be a pitched battle sometimes for 
control of the stereo: Our Led Zeppelin albums vs. Big Band buddy boy Beneke. 
One day Dad threw me a clipping from a jazz magazine and said: "Read." So we 
did. We read that Beneke, who was born in Ft. Worth, Tex., joined the Glenn 
Miller Orchestra in 1938 and quickly became one of the band's leading soloists 
with hits like "Ida, Sweet as Apple Cider." After Miller's death, Beneke led 
the orchestra until 1950, and has since added to his fame as a Big Band 
musician and leader. Beneke will blow his saxophone to kick off "A Golden 
Salute to Big Band Dancing" at 8 p.m. Friday at the Palladium, 6215 Sunset 
Blvd., Hollywood. Tickets are available through Ticketmaster. For information 
call (213) 962-7600. We're taking our kid. It's about time she learned to 
appreciate swell music.
