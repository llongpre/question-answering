   The world's top warblers are puckering
up for tunes ranging from Tchaikovsky to Led Zeppelin at the 11th
annual International Whistle-Off this weekend.
   ``I don't want to sound boastful, but I think it's a God-given
gift,'' said contestant Patty Ediger of Dayton, Ore. ``I think
maybe the shape of a person's mouth and his teeth have something to
do with it she practices two to three hours a day in the
months preceding the Whistle-Off. ``I go up to the wee hours of the
morning,'' she said. ``It takes a lot of time if you want to be
good.''
   ``Whistling as an art ranks very high in comparison with other
musical arts,'' said Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Jean Stokke.
``These are serious musicians and they're very competitive.''
   Thirty people were competing in four divisions today and Sunday
in what is billed as the nation's premier whistling event.
   Whistlers from 15 states, Canada and Mexico compete for a
round-trip flight to Mexico or the Caribbean. The prize will go to
the event's grand champion, with trophies going to the top three in
each division.
   Among the whistlers are former three-time grand champion Roy
Thoreson of Calgary, Alberta, and former two-time grand champion
Nancy Foran of Yakima, Wash.
   Other contestants include Michael Sherman of San Jose, Calif.,
who will perform Led Zeppelin's ``Stairway to Heaven'' in the
novelty division, and William Reichard of Ashland, Ore., who will
perform an abbreviated version of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 in
the solo classical division.
   Time limits are set to ``keep the event moving,'' Ms. Stokke
said. Each contestant must whistle three to six minutes for each
performance, except in the solo classical division, where four to
eight minutes are allowed.
   Whistlers can compete in as many as three of the four divisions:
solo classical, solo popular, novelty and duets. Judges score them
from 1 to 5 for artistry, interpretation and performance.
   ``You never know what to expect at this thing,'' Ms. Stokke
said. ``Last year, a guy wore a space suit and whistled the theme
from ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
   Past performers also have offered a medley from the Rolling
Stones and the rousing music of George M. Cohan.
   Contestants were to meet in preliminary rounds today, with the
top four in each category advancing to Sunday's finals. Those who
succeed today can't repeat the same tune Sunday.
   About 5,000 people are expected to attend the Whistle-Off.
There's no admission charge.
   Ms. Stokke said the event has ``really caught on.''
   ``We're finding that there are many people interested in
whistling and many whistlers who have not had a stage prior to this
time.''
