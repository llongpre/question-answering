   Alligator owner and tavern proprietor James
Schebler says mascot Crosby is a real pussycat, but the City
Council refused to allow the bar to display the lounge lizard.
   ``There are a lot of dogs in town that are not maintained
properly and are more of a danger than Crosby. If you maintain an
animal properly, the danger is at a minimum,'' said Schebler, who
bought Crosby's Cove in Coggon four months ago and named it after
his pet alligator.
   Schebler wanted to keep the alligator, now 2 feet long, in the
eastern Iowa bar to attract customers.
   But the council Tuesday rejected Schebler's request that the
community's dangerous pets ordinance be amended to allow alligators
to be kept in the city as long as they are in a locked container.
   Mayor James Pflughaupt Jr. told Schebler that before he could
display the alligator in his bar, he would have to win a change in
a state law that bars animals in establishments that sell food or
drink.
   Meanwhile, other problems surfaced for the reptile. During the
council meeting, it was disclosed that Crosby is living in Cedar
Rapids, which also has a dangerous animal ordinance that bans
alligators within city limits.

   A radio station in this Gulf Coast city
has come up with a novel format and a catchy entry into the 1990s _
playing nothing but songs recorded by the defunct rock group Led
Zeppelin _ 24 hours a day.
   Beginning at the stroke of the new year, radio station WKRL-FM
has been calling itself: ``The first all-Led Zeppelin radio
station.''
   The station first confused listeners on Sunday, the last day of
1989, by playing only the 1971 Led Zeppelin song ``Stairway to
Heaven'' _ over and over for 24 hours.
   Before each playing of the song _ which is among the most
requested rock songs in radio _ the station repeatedly announced:
``It's coming tomorrow ... Your Stairway to Heaven station.''
   The change followed the station's purchase by Great American
Broadcasting Co.
   Led Zeppelin, a British group of the late 1960s and 1970s, fused
blues, country and heavy metal music with dark lyricism. The band
released 10 albums over 12 years. The foursome included lead singer
Robert Plant, Jimmy Page on guitar, John Paul Jones on bass and
keyboards and the late drummer John Bonham.
