   Actress Dana Delany is tired of showing how
virtuous she can be. The Emmy-winning ``China Beach'' star says she
wants to be a ``bad girl.''
   ``I want to play different characters. I want to do comedy,
somebody who's not so heroic. Somebody who's bad,'' Delany says in
the September issue of GQ magazine.
   She's wanted to play those types of roles since she was a kid,
says Delany, who portrays nurse Colleen McMurphy on the television
show.
   ``My favorite actress growing up was Gloria Grahame. That's who
I want to be. A bad girl,'' she said. ``You get lots of
Irish-Catholic girls wanting to be bad girls.''
   Although she'd like to move on, Delany acknowledges her ``China
Beach'' role was a perfect fit: ``It was like somebody had read my
diaries; the way she felt was so honest. I felt like the character
was me.''

   Singer Curtis Mayfield, paralyzed by an accident
at a Brooklyn concert 11 days ago, was transferred Friday to a
spinal care treatment center near his Atlanta home.
   Mayfield, accompanied by his wife and son, left Kings County
Hospital Friday for the Shepherd Spinal Center in Atlanta, said a
spokesman at the Brooklyn hospital.
   The singer-songwriter was about to take the stage at an outdoor
concert on Aug. 13 when a sudden gust of wind toppled a light
tower, critically injuring Mayfield. Hospital officials and his
family have declined to say if the paralysis might be permanent.
   Mayfield, 48, was one of the founders of seminal rhythm and
blues band the Impressions and he composed the best-selling
``Superfly'' soundtrack.

   Ex-Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant says his
heavy metal band was wrongly accused of slipping Satanic messages
in its albums long before the current Judas Priest flap.
   ``I mean, who on Earth would have ever thought of doing that in
the first place? You've got to have a lot of time on your hands to
even consider that people would do that,'' Plant said in an
interview with Rolling Stone magazine.
   Plant said if his band had used the backward masking, where the
lyrics can only be heard by playing an album backwards, it might
have included a message more money-driven than malicious.
   ``I figure if backward masking really worked, every record in
the store would have `buy this album' hidden in it,'' said Plant.
   In Reno, Nev., a judge ruled Friday that hidden words do exist
on an album by the British rock band Judas Priest. But the judge
ruled they were not placed there intentionally and the group was
not responsible for a suicide pact formed by two young fans.
   Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead said the alleged
words ``do it'' were the result of a chance combination of sounds.

   The three-bedroom home where Bob Dylan
grew up in northeastern Minnesota has been sold, said a real estate
broker.
   The two-story, stucco house was sold Tuesday to a couple with
two children, broker Curt Curtis said Thursday. The sale price was
not disclosed.
   ``They did not buy it because of the Dylan affiliation,'' Curtis
said.
   But the connection could be a good thing if they ever decide to
sell, said the new owner, Gregg French, 35, a Frito-Lay route
salesman.
   While French and his wife, Donna, 32, don't intend to sell the
home they just bought, he said, ``I feel this house would have a
little more protection against a downturn in the market.''
   The house was put up for sale in October 1988 with an asking
price of $84,000. The list price was later reduced to $56,900, he
said.
   The house was owned for 22 years by Terry and Angel Marolt, who
raised a son and a daughter there after buying it from Dylan's
mother.
   Dylan, 49, was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth and grew up
in Hibbing. He moved to New York and became known for his 1960s
protest songs, including ``Blowin' in the Wind'' and ``Masters of
War.''

   Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the
world's first successful liver transplant, underwent heart surgery
Friday.
   Surgeons began the coronary artery bypass operation on Starzl at
7:30 a.m. and finished nearly five hours later at Presbyterian
University Hospital, where he has performed hundreds of transplants.
   Starzl was in stable condition in the hospital's intensive care
unit.
   ``The surgery was uncomplicated and Dr. Starzl is doing well,''
said Gary Marrone, who led the surgical team.
   On July 9, surgeons removed a blockage from Starzl's right
coronary artery after he complained of chest pains. Doctors said he
was doing well following that operation.
   Starzl, 64, performed the first successful liver transplant, at
the University of Colorado in 1967. He also pioneered development
of a medical team that performed 200 kidney transplants at Colorado
General and Denver Veteran's Administration hospitals.
   In 1981, Starzl began work at the University of Pittsburgh,
which he helped make one of the world's premier transplant centers.
Last year, the hospital performed more than 460 liver transplants
and 210 kidney transplants.
