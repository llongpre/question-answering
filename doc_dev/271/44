A puff of fog, a synthesized violin, and it's gloom-rock hero Peter Murphy, 
close-cropped hair protruding like a blond parsnip, posed like St. Sebastian on 
stage at the Wiltern Theatre on Thursday. You've heard of the Thin White Duke? 
Murphy is thinner, whiter, more aristocratic in bearing. 
</P>
<P>
He's the sort of performer who always seems to know, within a degree or two, 
the angle at which his cheekbones glint most fetchingly in the sea-green 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
He'd crouch leonine on a stack of amplifiers and pounce, not skipping a beat. 
He suffered, even as he danced, under lighting designed to look like moaty 
sunbeams filtering into a subterranean prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
When Murphy sang, he directed his words up into the flies and winced, as if 
imploring the Almighty. Murphy's voice is a cross between Bowie and "Lust for 
Life"-era Iggy; his music a slightly jazzier take on the spare, two-chord 
death-rock formula (which he helped invent with Bauhaus, the Led Zeppelin of 
the genre); his performance spectacular, feline, reptilian, letter-perfect, 
creepier than Malcolm McDowell at the height of his powers. 
</P>
<P>
Exene Cervenka, another ex-lead singer of a dark, religion-obsessed ensemble 
(X), opened with a quiet, powerful set of neo-country, her flat, quavering 
voice made strong by a band that included X's Tony Gilkyson on guitar. Thin 
White Rope is scheduled as the opening act for the final night of Murphy's 
Wiltern stand tonight. JONATHAN GOLD
