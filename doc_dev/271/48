SCREEN GEMS: Warren Beatty may be directing "Dick Tracy," but our favorite new 
actor-turned-director is Kiefer Sutherland, who'll be at the helm of the next 
Jude Cole video, "House Full of Reasons." One reason to watch for the clip: 
It'll feature a guest appearance by Sutherland's current paramour, actress 
Julia Roberts. . . . Serious Rock Fans should keep their eyes peeled for a sly 
visual joke in the upcoming "Back to the Future III."

In a sequence that takes Michael J. Fox back to the Wild West of the 1880s, we 
see a scraggly, bearded clump of musicians playing at a raucous hoedown. The 
beards aren't fake -- the band is none other than ZZ Top, who pluck some old 
Western-style tunes (and even offer a trademark spin of their guitars). The 
guys can also be heard performing a new rock tune, "Double Back," on the film's 
sound track. . . . And we're betting that Columbus, Ohio's WMGG-FM must have 
heard that Led Zeppelin recently reunited for Jason Bonham's wedding (the 
surviving members of the group, with Jason on drums, played "Rock &amp; Roll," 
"Custard Pie" and "Bring It on Home"). Maybe that's why -- as a programming 
stunt -- the station debuted its new classic-rock format earlier this month by 
playing "Stairway to Heaven" nonstop for . . . 16 consecutive hours!
