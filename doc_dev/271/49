<TEXT>  (SBK); all formats; (star)(star) 1/2; The disc isn't nearly as bad as it has
every right to be. When it comes to rap, Vanilla Ice is as bland and
superficial as his moniker. The very idea of such a pop buffoon releasing a
live album would seem to be an oxy in search of a moron.;    Surprisingly,
"Extremely Live" is just that. Recorded at various stops on his recent "To the
Extreme" world tour, the record is a hot-blooded -- if contrived -- set of the
Iceman's pop rap. Most of the cuts come with real drums, the honking sax of
Don Diego and the Ice, who seems to warm up in front of a crowd.;    Songs
such as "Ice Ice Baby" from his smash debut record "To The Extreme" sound less
produced and more human than their recorded counterparts. And on one of the
new songs, "Road to My Riches," there are slashing metal guitar chords that
hint the Ice might be on to a new sound. He even does right -- astoundingly!
-- by the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction" on versions recorded live and in the
studio, providing a new rap take on the classic.;    All of this said, he
can't help being Vanilla Ice, which is to say he is hokey and dumb and his
raps are as air-headed as a balloon character in the Macy's parade. But this
record is a vast improvement on "To the Extreme" and that is a nice surprise.;
   -- Harry Sumrall;  Pop;  THE BOBS; "The Bobs Sing the Songs of . . .";
(Kaleidoscope); CD, cassette; (star)(star) 1/2; Local club audiences need no
introduction to the Bobs -- the a cappella aces have been staples on the San
Francisco circuit for 10 years. Their vocal arrangement of Lennon and
McCartney's "Helter Skelter" (included here) earned the group -- now a quintet
-- a Grammy nomination in '83.;    This fourth exercise in recorded zaniness
-- a formulaic package of a dozen rock classics and one original song -- is
good for a laugh, but it would take a masochist of the first order to listen
to the entire disc in one sitting. This is a novelty item, and as with most
novelty items, it's best suited for home tape-makers searching for just the
right wacko number to round out a tape.;    The best covers include Led
Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" and the Talking Heads' "Psycho Killer." The only
two gems that transcend the cutesy premise are, predictably, two from the
black vocal tradition: Smokey Robinson's "You Really Got a Hold on Me" and
Jimmy Cliff's reggae classic "Sittin' in Limbo." Sans instrumentation, they
both come across as natural as breathing. This is a fine concept -- one that
is also done well by the Genuine Diamelles and the Edlos. If one more San
Francisco band jumps into the a cappella fray here, it might warrant a new
category for the Bay Area Music Awards.;    -- David Plotnikoff; ...; BEE
GEES; "High Civilization"; (Warner Bros.); all formats; (star); The Brothers
Gibb have displayed a remarkable ability to adapt to the pop of the day over
the course of their career, from their Beatles-inspired songs of the '60s to
their disco vampings of the '70s.;    With this record they try to do the same
with the prevailing pop of the moment. But instead of sounding fresh and
contemporary, they merely come off as slavishly desperate imitators.;    Songs
such as "Party With No Name" are sleek and slick and mindless dance romps
while the driving "Ghost Train" is a generic, middle-of-the-road adult rocker.
"Secret Love" is a Gibb take on the Beach Boys, while "The Only Love" is a
synthesizer-infused ballad.;    Yes, the grandiose Gibb harmonies are there in
abundance and the group has its usual, savvy melodic sense. And the title cut
does have that expansive Bee Gees presence.;    But "High Civilization" is,
too often, a low-brow flop.;    -- H.S.;  THE SUBDUDES; "Lucky"; (East West
Records America); all formats; (star)(star)(star) 1/2; Imagine you were the
only person with a copy of Paul Simon's "Graceland." Or you grew up next door
to Los Lobos and heard them rehearse before they ever played a gig.;    You'd
probably be ranting to all your friends, telling them they've got to hear
these guys . . .;    That's how I've felt for two years about the Subdudes, a
band few people have heard of and fewer still have listened to, despite the
fact they've put out two of the most interesting and fun albums in recent
years.;    Their latest, "Lucky," picks up where their first self-named album
left off, a blend of Cajun and Mexican music with good old rock 'n' roll that
probably doesn't get the airplay it deserves because it's so hard to
classify.;    The best I can do is say the band combines Simon's songwriting
and vocals with Los Lobos' energy and musicianship. And on the new album, they
throw on a little Joe Walsh -- adding some wicked electric slide guitar on
such songs as "Straight Shot" and "Someday, Somehow" to the already rich mix
of acoustic guitar, mandolin, accordion and various drums.;    Although more
than two years have passed between albums, the dudes suffer a bit of the
sophomore slump. The songwriting on the first seems better and more memorable.
But that was one of those albums on which every song was a classic and stuck
in your head from the first time you heard it.;    Now, if only they'd tour in
the Bay Area.; -- Brad Kava  </TEXT>
