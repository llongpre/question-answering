Sure, there are plenty of reggae-style Led Zeppelin tribute bands fronted by 
Elvis impersonators, but there's a reason why Dread Zeppelin is the one with a 
recording contract. 
</P>
<P>
At the Palace on Tuesday, the six-man band (plus singer Tortelvis' omnipresent 
towel- and water-boy) stretched one joke into more than an hour of fun. 
</P>
<P>
The Zeppelin songs that make up most of Dread Zeppelin's live repertoire (as 
well as its new album "Un-Led-Ed") retain their name, but they sure don't 
remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
From a medley of "Black Dog" and "Hound Dog" -- complete with canned barks -- 
to an elaborate, toasted "Stairway to Heaven," the group twisted the sacred 
classics into laugh-inducing caricatures, placing heavy emphasis on guitar 
excess and Tortelvis' Vegas song stylings. 
</P>
<P>
But for all their cleverness, such parodies might grow tiresome if it weren't 
for the group's visual appeal. 
</P>
<P>
A "Gilligan's Island"-meets-"Blue Hawaii" stage set provided a suitably skewed 
backdrop for the wildly attired band, whose members range from the dreadlocked, 
caftan-clad Ed Zeppelin on percussion to bassist Put-Mon, who on Tuesday 
sported a barely-there bathing suit. Tortelvis himself was resplendent in an 
electric blue jumpsuit anchored by a freeway-wide white belt. Funniest of all 
was the interplay between Tortelvis and his surly valet, who never failed to 
interrupt a performance in order to comb the ersatz King's hair.

Dread Zeppelin is a labor of a whole lotta love, but you don't have to work 
hard to appreciate the results. JEAN ROSENBLUTH
