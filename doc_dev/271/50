<TEXT>     By 1979, when the rest of us started catching on, Lowell George was another
dead rock 'n' roll legend, and Little Feat was history.;   But 12 years later,
the Little Feat that regrouped in 1987 is playing more concerts to more people
than it ever did in its days with George.;   And the refitted Feat's latest
disc, "Shake Me Up," released last week, is the most recent step in a
carefully choreographed comeback that began with the 1988 album "Let it Roll,"
followed by "Representing the Mambo.";   "Shake Me Up," says keyboardist and
founding member Bill Payne, 42, is "a little more straightforward -- in a
word, accessible.";   "Accessible" is a new entry in the Little Feat lexicon.
From the group's beginning in 1969, when Payne hooked up with a brilliant,
moody, insecure ex-member of the Frank Zappa fold named Lowell George, it was
doomed to be a critics' darling and a commercial derelict.;   The group's
misfit style was pure Americana -- Memphis rock, New Orleans funk, Nashville
country, Mississippi gospel and Chicago blues, set against a sophisticated,
syncopated backbeat. Musicians loved it, but the music industry didn't have a
clue. That meant radio exposure was negligible.;   Fan power; Complicating
matters was the fact that, like the Grateful Dead, Little Feat never was much
of a studio band -- its energy came from its audience. But George had a strong
distaste for touring. To be a Little Feat fan, you had to work at it. But it
was worth it.;   George's sensuous slide guitar, second only to Duane
Allman's, tended to overshadow what is to this day the world's hottest bottom
in rock: drummer Richie Hayward, bassist Kenny Gradney, percussionist Sam
Clayton and Payne.;   The songs George wrote, including "Fat Man in the
Bathtub," "Dixie Chicken," "Sailin' Shoes," "Rocket in My Pocket" and "Willin'
" were classics the first time they were played. But possibly his greatest
genius was the sly, slippery way he could phrase a song.;   But even if George
had not died in an Arlington, Va., motel room after a concert promoting his
new solo career, Little Feat's days would have been numbered.;   "I was pretty
much fed up with the proceedings, mainly of Lowell's," says Payne. "There were
too many drugs, and I thought it alienated from what we were trying to
accomplish. I'd been doing a lot of sessions at that point, and I said, 'This
isn't the way normal people do it.' ";   The band dissolved. And then, without
a radio hit to their name, they became popular. People magazine dubbed them
"America's best unknown band." The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin called them
their favorite rock 'n' roll band. Posthumously, their cult status was
cinched.;   Payne, always an in-demand sideman, hit the road with James
Taylor, Bob Seger, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt.;   Barrere did two solo
albums and albums with the Bluesbusters band; Gradney toured with Nicolette
Larson and Warren Zevon; Hayward worked with Zevon, Robert Plant and Joan
Armatrading; and Clayton played with Jimmy Buffett for seven years.;  
Ironically, it was a dedication for George that inspired the band to regroup.
The former Feat were in North Hollywood to commemorate a room at a rehearsal
hall in George's name. An impromptu jam session ensued.;   The "R" word was
inevitable. But Payne had stipulations. "A:, that we get another singer to
cover Lowell's place, and B: if we couldn't write music to hold up to the old
songs, maybe we shouldn't do it at all.";   Search for one nets two; The
search for a singer lighted briefly on longtime Feat fan Bonnie Raitt and also
Robert Palmer. Never mind that Palmer was English and his suits Italian, an
obvious mismatch with the all-American Feat.;   The band ended up choosing not
one, but two new members to flesh out the gap left by George. Vocalist Craig
Fuller (of Pure Prairie League and "Amy" fame) and guitarist Fred Tackett were
both close associates of the old Feat.;   Payne's second criterion was little
problem, either. Payne, who wrote "Tripe Face Boogie," "Oh Atlanta" and "Time
Loves a Hero," among other Feat hits, and Barrere, who penned "Feats Don't
Fail Me Now," "All That You Dream" and "Old Folks Boogie," had begun to take
over the songwriting near the end of the Feat's first stand; they knew the
territory.;   Even so, why chance a comeback? With successful post-Feat
careers, why mess with a legacy?;   "It's definitely risky," says Payne. "If
the music and the management end of it isn't right, there's no sense in doing
it because I have too much to lose right now. I'd have to be out of my mind to
put something together that wasn't going to knock people's socks off."; Little
