For this week's Pop Beat, we'll catch up on some recent releases by Orange 
County-based performers: The scale is * (poor) to ***** (a classic).

Walter Trout Band 
</P>
<P>
"Life In The Jungle." (Bozz of Electra): **** 
</P>
<P>
Trout, who lives in Huntington Beach, gave up a steady, high-profile gig when 
he left John Mayall's Bluesbreakers to go on his own earlier this year. Now we 
can see why -- "Life In The Jungle" heralds the arrival of a blues-rock talent 
of the first order. The album, recorded in Denmark and issued in Europe (it's 
available as an import at Music Market in Costa Mesa), showcases a performer 
who is confident, mature and strikingly well rounded. Trout's sizzling guitar 
work alone makes "Life In The Jungle" a must for six-string aficionados, but 
there is much more than that here. Among the album's five original songs are 
two ebullient, good-timey rockers and a couple of lovely, pop-flavored ballads 
sung with a wistful soulfulness. The stormy title song conjures up the fear 
brought on by a murder in Trout's own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
At various times, Trout's approach can recall the stately blues balladry of 
Eric Clapton ("The Mountain Song,"), the warmth of Little Feat ("Frederica"), 
or the animal spirits of Lynyrd Skynyrd ("Good Enough To Eat"). A live version 
of Jimi Hendrix's "Red House" finds Trout indulging his old tendency to overdo 
the speed and flash. But elsewhere, he reaches an effective balance between 
wildness and control with playing that serves his material rather than his ego. 
</P>
<P>
Trout and his versatile backing trio are at their most potent on stage: The 
album ends with a searing, 15-minute psychodrama built around live renditions 
of the blues standards "Cold Cold Feeling" and "Serve Me Right to Suffer." The 
two connected songs become an epiphany of anguish and remorse in a performance 
that can stand as a textbook example of blues musicians tapping the deepest 
reaches of their chosen calling's well of emotions. 
</P>
<P>
National People's Gang 
</P>
<P>
"Orange." (Dr. Dream): *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
One's attitude toward National People's Gang depends largely on one's response 
to Chad Jasmine's calculatedly theatrical singing. Listeners who like their 
rock vocals in the offhanded vernacular might not go for Jasmine's stagey act, 
which can seem archly Anglicized and overdone. But there is nothing wrong with 
theatricality when it brings a meaty role to life, and NPG's songs come off 
like one-act monologues in which Jasmine gets inside the skin of obsessed 
characters placed at emotional extremes. "Love Button," for example, finds him 
doing a wired, James Woods-type turn as a gambling junkie going bust in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these playlets are abstract, but they never lack an intriguing, 
off-center point: "Breaking Ground," an evocative, thought-provoking song about 
detachment, seems to look down upon the sweat and heartbreak of humanity from 
somewhere above the stratosphere. "White Boxes" is an unsettling examination of 
the disguises that dysfunctional families don in an attempt to appear normal. A 
feverish version of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' 
Groovy)" becomes a simultaneously mocking and exhilarating demolition derby 
ride over the song that sounds as if Johnny Rotten is in the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Stylistically, NPG is an art-rock band with a strong command of textures 
ranging from shimmering pop brightness to furious, focused pounding. The rhythm 
section is deft and strong, with new bassist Deyo Glines adding some funkiness. 
Chad Forrello is the do-everything MVP of NPG, a guitarist of commendable 
selflessness whose playing is exciting without being obtrusive. Perhaps best of 
all, the band steers clear of fashionable cynicism. Without sacrificing the 
right to be ironic, National People's Gang shows that you don't have to lose a 
sense of innocence, idealism and heart to prove that you're smart. After last 
year's fine debut album, "The Hard Swing," NPG serves notice with "Orange" that 
its creative reserves run deep. 
</P>
<P>
Exude 
</P>
<P>
"Testosterone Tapdance." (Rah! Rah!): *** 
</P>
<P>
Lust and love is the subject, and while that's nothing novel, Exude's strongly 
melodic pop craftsmanship keeps the oldest theme of all from getting stale. 
Hunkering down in its Anaheim garage, this look-ma-no-guitars trio was able to 
fashion a danceable techno-pop sound that is warm and human instead of coldly 
mechanized. Frank Rogala's grainy, breathy vocals deserve some credit for that. 
Rogala's voice is limited, but by borrowing resourcefully from such non-techno 
sources as Mick Jagger, Tom Petty and Peter Wolf, he pieces together a singing 
style that makes up in verve and personality what it lacks in purity and 
strength. That's where Exude's savvy comes in: The band is smart enough to 
surround the lead vocal parts with catchy ensemble harmonies that offset 
Rogala's roughness and round out the sound. Younger brother Vince Rogala's 
saxophone riffing provides another attractive voice to bolster the framework, 
while Robin Canada's runs on conventional keyboards are a nice antidote to the 
usual dance pop synths and samples. 
</P>
<P>
On "359 Directions," an otherwise promising ballad that aims to recreate the 
Stones' "Angie"/"Wild Horses" mode, Frank Rogala falters by trying to reach too 
far beyond his ability. Exude's other false step (besides the off-putting album 
cover) is a brooding instrumental finale that has nothing to do with anything 
that comes before it on the album. 
</P>
<P>
Exude celebrates lust while giving romance its due, and it frequently brings to 
bear a light and clever lyrical touch ("You got me ga ga from the get go/You 
did a tap dance right on my testosterone") that is missing from most 
dance-oriented pop. 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car 
</P>
<P>
"Album Type Thing." (Cruz): ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
The title tells a lot: Big Drill Car's music is direct, plain-spoken and 
economical, while its lyrics deal with the awkwardness that comes from facing 
the emotional growing pains of youth. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot to admire here. For one thing, Big Drill Car hits with a force 
that fully justifies its name. There is nothing fancy going on: the ensemble 
delivers a heavy, rhythmic throb and crunch, with occasional brief solo jabs 
from a metallic lead guitar. Melody never gets steamrollered, though. Big Drill 
Car's aim is to be a punked-up pop band, hard-edged but catchy, and it usually 
succeeds. The lyrics, and singer Frank Daly's delivery, are honest and 
straightforward reflections of what it's like to be living in the aftermath of 
adolescence, with its intense loves, regrets and frustrations. While the songs 
deal with facing problems and failures, they also carry an appealing sense of 
hopefulness and optimism that experience can be the foundation for growth. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the four-man band is a little too single-minded and direct. 
The songs take no unexpected turns -- the music is all headlong attack, with 
the occasional Led Zeppelin-style tromp beat the only minor relief. The lyrics 
don't move beyond the earnest, unadorned depiction of immediate feeling. And 
those consistently catchy melodic hooks are a little too consistent: while each 
song stands well on its own, a sense of sameness sets in over the course of the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Word play, humor and a musical approach more conscious of the need for variety 
and dynamic shifts should be on Big Drill Car's agenda the next time out. But 
for now, this young band has laid a good foundation. (Big Drill Car plays 
Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano).
