   A Scottish band called ``Texas'' is bound to
cause some confusion. First of all, the group's name comes from the
film ``Paris, Texas,'' not the state.
   Also, their music shows no trace of Scottish roots, drawing
instead on the folk and blues of such Americans as Ry Cooder and
Elmore James.
   That's one reason their debut album, ``Southside,'' took so long
to make. As singer Sharleen Spiteri explained, finding a producer
capable of understanding the viewpoints of four determined young
musicians was nearly impossible.
   ``We had the songs arranged for a long time and we really just
needed someone to get us in the mood,'' said Spiteri, 21, ``but the
producers always wanted to add a few keyboards or even a saxophone.
   ``We just believed in our sound. We were very stubborn. We
welcomed suggestions, but there were too many people. It becomes
the producer and record company on one side, and the band on the
other. It's like a conveyor belt: `OK, this band won't get a record
so we'll go the next band.'''
   Texas, Spiteri explained, is willing to take orders, but only if
you ask nicely. The members prefer sitting down and discussing
ideas, coming to decisions that reflect everyone's input.
   ``It's a lot different from one person,'' Spiteri said. ``With
four people you get different ideas, you get some interesting
conversations. Maybe they'll change my mind on bits and pieces,
maybe I'll change theirs. It's good we are a band that's able to
talk.''
   They know how fortunate they are to just have a record. Growing
up in Glasgow, unemployment was a stubborn fact of life from which
music provided a cherished escape.
   ``I came out of school and luckily enough got a job as a
hairdresser,'' Spiteri said.
   ``I started off with just a Saturday job and then managed to get
full-time work. A lot of people thought because I had such a secure
job, one that a lot of people in Scotland would give their right
arm for, I was crazy to give it up for a career in music.''
   ``My dad's unemployed,'' guitarist Ally McErlaine said.
``Because of the class structure and everything, it's geared to
keeping the working classes down and stopping people from getting
anywhere. You can't get a good job. But for playing in a band, we
didn't have to have any sort of background.''
   Texas was formed in the spring of 1987 when a friend introduced
Spiteri to bassist John McElhone. They quickly wrote ``I Don't Need
a Lover,'' the album's first single, which opens with a slide
guitar influenced by Cooder's soundtrack for ``Paris, Texas.''
   ``A lot of the people think the album's about old
relationships,'' said Spiteri, who cited Linda Ronstadt and Patsy
Cline as influences.
   ```I Don't Want a Lover' is male-female, but it's also about
everything that's happened to us, the high unemployment in
Scotland, the fact a lot of our family and friends are unemployed.''
   Getting a record deal was, surprisingly, the easy part for
Texas, who now had McErlaine and drummer Stuart Kerr aboard. The
band signed with Phonogram in England. But making the album was an
unwelcome lesson in the blues, starting when the young group headed
for America to work with producer Bernard Edwards, the former
bassist for Chic.
   ``It never got very far,'' Spiteri said. ``We worked for a month
and it was still very basic. We came back very upset. We were
thinking how we spent so much money and so much time.''
   They eventually hooked up with Tim Palmer, who had produced
former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant among others.
   ``It was quite a relief,'' McErlaine said. ``We were getting on
well and he was bringing more out of it. He just let us do our
thing. There were a lot of battles working with other producers and
we knew we had to try someone else.''
   Everyone contributes to the songs, usually written around a
guitar riff or bass pattern.
   ``Ally will make changes and maybe I'll change something and
from that point we'll rehearse it and see what happens,'' Spiteri
said. ``Over the past 2{ years, all the things that have happened
forced us to put them into the songs. The feelings brought on by
all the producers and studios rubbed off.''
   ``Prayer for You,'' ``Faith'' and ``The Future Is Promises'' all
reflect the group's struggle to make the record. McErlaine called
that spirit a product of their upbringing, the determination to
work hard and not compromise.
   Spiteri talked of ``Prayer for You'' and its words of
encouragement: ``I could never watch you suffer, I could never let
you down. And I hope you soon discover, all the truth that I've now
found.''
   ```Prayer for You' was the last song we wrote for the album,''
the singer recalled. ``It was a very basic acoustic guitar and
vocal that we took it into the studio and jammed on. Everything
came out on it, it was a relief.
   ``Everything was coming to a head at that point. We had people
saying, `Oh God, are they going to do it?' You felt that everybody
was thinking, `Can these people work with anyone else?' All these
people were coming in with ideas. But it's not their record, it's
ours.''
