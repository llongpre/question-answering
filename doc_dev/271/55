<LEADPARA>  Cases like Field Trip's are enough to make one abandon all hope for the
commercial recording industry. This is a fractured fairy-tale story of a bunch
of Pleasanton middle-school social outcasts who "banded together with the
honorable intention of poking fun at all the social cliques." They spent a
decade perfecting their craft, got signed to a major label and cranked out two
solid albums with at least a half-dozen radio-worthy potential hits. And
they're still trying to break out of the local club scene. Most of the dorks
on the airwaves today would sell their drummer to the devil for a chance to
write such achingly beautiful pieces of post-teen angst as "Thirteen," "Blue
Blanket" and "Buttercup." So why aren't these guys famous yet? Could be that
commercial radio programmers with all their focus groups and marketing
consultants wouldn't recognize a good song if it walked up and bit 'em on the
backside. Could be the band's infuriating insistence on looking and acting
just like the upper-middle-class suburban kids they are. They're far too
"normal" and low-key to ever cut it on MTV. The first album, "Beautiful," was
raw, unbridled garage-band punk fury that only hinted at the band's more
introspective side. The follow-up, "Headgear," was one of the best major-label
albums of last year -- focused, lyrical and infused with a sweet
country-and-western feel. The group's third album, "Ripe," is due out Sept. 24
(Slash Records).; ...  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  FIELD TRIP; Formed: 1984.; Lineup: Jim Galbraith, guitar, vocals.; Tom
Galbraith, drums.; Greg Kinkle, bass.; Stephen Laborde, guitar.; Home base:
Pleasanton.; Recordings: Two albums, "Beautiful" (1989) on Ruby Records and
"Headgear" (1990) on Slash Records.; Comments: Great songwriting,
unpredictable live shows.; Dates: Sept. 21, the Starry Plough, Berkeley.; The
Movie Stars; They're the top dogs on the South of Market neo-folk-rock scene
-- and deservedly so. When bassist "Wholesome Jill" Olson was an English major
at the University of Iowa in 1985, her band, the Stouthearted, opened a campus
show for San Francisco's Muskrats. The Muskrats convinced Olson to relocate to
the Bay Area -- where she found, to her dismay, a folk-rock scene that
consisted of the Muskrats and one other band. The Stars (with a little help
from club booker Dawn Holliday) were the first to get the new sound across to
large, rock-oriented audiences. Today the band is probably the most polished
unit on the South of Market circuit. Genuine warmth on stage and a
perfectionist bent in the recording studio should start paying off handsomely
any time now.; ...; THE MOVIE STARS; Formed: 1987.; Lineup: Jill Olson, bass
and vocals.; Michael Montalto, guitar and vocals.; Steve Cornell, guitars,
bouzouki and vocals.; Damon Carman: drums and percussion.; Home base: San
Francisco.; Recordings: Two independent albums, "Heck-Ola" (1989) and "Head on
a Platter" (1990).; Comments: Honky-tonk fun for post-collegiate hipsters and
renegade folkies.; Dates: Sept. 14, the Starry Plough, Berkeley; Sept. 19,
Above Paradise, San Francisco.; The Genuine Diamelles; This off-beat mostly
vocal quartet is the most unlikely success story on the local scene. Four
South-of-Market bar habitues with backgrounds in punk, heavy metal and poetry
doing darkly humorous a cappella renditions of pop standards is not exactly
the recipe for big-time success -- but it's worked beautifully so far. They're
certainly the only Hotel Utah regulars to open for acts such as David Bowie,
Edie Brickell and Graham Parker. (Booking agents and stage managers love the
Diamelles because they require virtually no stage setup.) Early works included
hilarious a cappella de-constructions of everything from the "Underdog" and
"Sesame Street" themes to Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir" and Edvard Grieg's "Peer
Gynt Suite." More recent sets have included more instrumentation and more
original material. One of the new songs on the band's current demo tape, the
sinister "Who Keeps Feeding These Pigeons?" was aired nationwide on Dr.
Demento's weekly radio diary of the deranged recently.; ...; THE GENUINE
DIAMELLES; Formed: 1988.; Lineup: Scott Young, vocals.; Smelley Kelley,
vocals.; Debbie Tennerino, vocals.; Junglebook, vocals.; Home base: San
Francisco.; Recordings: Current demo tape sold only at shows.; Comments: Too
damn cute for their own good -- but they'll be doing Letterman well before any
of these other bands.; Dates: Sept. 7, El Rio, San Francisco; Sept. 14, Golden
Gate Park Band Shell (1:30 p.m.); Sept. 21, the Hotel Utah, San Francisco.  </TEXT>
