<LEADPARA>  WHEN Alice Cooper and Kiss -- replete with fantastic powers -- first stormed
the pages of a comic book in 1977, it seemed only natural.;   After all, rock
music and comic books go together. They appeal to the young, they're art forms
long considered to be on the fringe of respectability and parents aren't
particularly fond of either of them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although the far-out rock fantasies didn't last long, comic-book
biographies of music groups are the latest craze. And this month rock fantasy
may be aiming for a comeback with industry giant DC Comics' first rock comic
book, featuring Prince. The book, which was edited by Prince, was designed to
coincide with his recent record release and will be sold on his upcoming
tour.;   Rock comics are designed to tap into the lucrative music market and
are aimed at fans of all ages. From books on the Who for the classic rock
listener to new updates on Guns N' Roses and 2 Live Crew, rock comics pique
the interest of the non-comics reader who wants to learn more about his
favorite group.;   Currently, rock comics spring from the independent leagues,
propelled mainly by the Rock-n-Roll Comics line begun in 1988 by Revolutionary
Comics in San Diego. Featuring everyone from the Beatles to Motley Crue to
Pink Floyd to Frank Zappa, Revolutionary has turned out some 40 biographical
comic books about rock stars.;   Selling about 10,000 copies monthly,
Revolutionary was listed in Comics Values Monthly as "the hottest book in
recent years that is not a superhero/science fiction or comedy title.";  
Other rock comics include the deluxe "Grateful Dead Comix," an authorized
series based on the band's lyrics, from Kitchen Sink Press in Princeton, Wis.,
and Rock Fantasy Comics from Pittsburgh, which features the fictional
adventures of such bands as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie and the
Doors. Rock Fantasy recently went out of business but the books are still in
some stores. (Look for rock comic books at independent record stores and some
comic book shops.);   Heavy metal sells;   "The Rock-n-Roll Comics sell well
here -- but it depends on the title," said Scott Baker, manager of Penny Lane,
a music and novelty store in Chicago. "Their first issue, on Guns N' Roses, we
ordered 15 copies and they sold out in a week.";   Baker said that comics
featuring classic rock and heavy metal groups sell best. Michael Jackson and
Vanilla Ice comic books languish on the shelves.;   "People who are music
collectors might buy a comic because its cheaper than a CD," he said. "Other
people will want to collect everything about a band, like the Beatles. Rock
comics are appealing to the kids who like comics and to the adults as novelty
items.";   Comic books have also been used as marketing tools by record
companies. Marvel was hired to create comic books about Cheap Trick and the
rap group Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. And the pop-metal band Trixter used a comic
biography drawn by former Batman artist Neil Adams as part of its 1990 press
kit.;   The Prince book marks the first effort from DC's newly created Piranha
Music line, which hopes to release three rock comics a month.;   "We have
wanted to make music comics for some time," explained Andy Helfer, group
editor in charge of experimental products for DC Comics in New York. "Since
MTV started, music is no longer simply an aural experience. You need to see it
as well as hear it. And, because of all the musical biographies coming out, it
makes sense to convey the information faster in a comic book.";   In the book,
"Prince: Alter Ego," the star battles his evil twin, Gemini, a character
Prince himself introduced in his "Batman" soundtrack. It isn't a biography,
but instead turns Prince into a superhero.;   Prince's career has already been
offered in biographical comics form. Revolutionary claimed that honor in
February with a book featuring a few things Prince probably would rather
forget -- such as being booed off the stage during a 1981 opening slot for the
Rolling Stones in Los Angeles.;   "We're unauthorized and proud of it," said
Revolutionary President Todd Loren, repeating the slogan emblazoned on the
cover of every Revolutionary comic. Like an unauthorized biography, an
unauthorized comic typically contains more scandalous, and sometimes
questionable, material about the stars featured.;   Unauthorized also means,
however, that the comic company doesn't pay for the rights to use a
performer's image or name -- and that usually leads to a lawsuit from the
act's merchandiser.;   Since Loren began publishing Rock-n-Roll Comics in
1989, he's fought plenty of lawsuits, facing off such bands as Bon Jovi (in
the lawsuit, lead singer Jon Bon Jovi objected to the way he looked in the
drawings), New Kids on the Block and Skid Row.;   Revolutionary was stopped
from publishing its Skid Row comic book and was ordered to burn 15,000 copies
of its Motley Crue issue once the two bands' merchandising company, Great
Southern, brought in its legal teams.;   Last year, Winterland Concessions
Co., which owns the marketing rights to Madonna, Janet Jackson and New Kids on
the Block, sued to block publication of a New Kids satire released by
Revolutionary.;   Winterland lost the battle -- the book was judged to be
protected by the First Amendment -- but can still sue for trademark
infringement.;   Madonna: nothing doing;   Harvey Comics in Santa Monica,
publishers of children's comics such as "Casper" and "Richie Rich," had
authorization from Winterland for its New Kids comics, which aren't
biographical but instead feature the band members in made-up adventures.;  
"We also tried for Madonna, but a comic book was just something she wasn't
interested in doing," said Jeff Montgomery, president of Harvey Comics.  </TEXT>
