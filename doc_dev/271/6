CRITIC'S LED ZEPPELIN SONG REMAINS THE SAME

<TEXT>

This letter is in response to a recent article about Robert Plant ("Down to 
Earth -- Singer Robert Plant's Post-Zeppelin Career Isn't So Full of Hot Air," 
by Mike Boehm, Aug. 9, 1990, OC LIVE!).

First of all, there has never been a band in contemporary pop music as 
misunderstood as Led Zeppelin. The comment that you made in the article -- 
about Led Zeppelin putting "sensation first and plain old sense a distant 
second, maybe ninth or tenth" -- epitomizes the total lack of understanding 
that much of the media has never overcome in regards to the band and their 
music. On the contrary, Led Zeppelin is one of the few bands that had managed 
to keep sensation out of their music while pushing ahead with their own 
capabilities, both individually and collectively, within the framework of a 
single working unit. As a unit, Led Zeppelin reached heights most only dream 
of, but the important thing is that they did it without compromising any of 
their musical integrity or vision. As a result, their music had a certain 
unconventional edge that was unique to themselves. However, it did not cause 
any of their songs to make less "sense" as you had indicated. The truth is 
that, whether acoustic or electric, Zeppelin employed a wide range of sounds to 
give their songs substance, depth and meaning (characteristics that many of 
today's bands urgently need.) 
</P>
<P>
As far as describing "the band's method" as you did, Led Zeppelin had no 
method. To them, having a method was un-rock 'n' roll. For rock 'n' roll in its 
purest sense is energetic, spontaneous and unpredictable. During the '70s, when 
the band was in its prime, one of the members remarked about the release of 
their forthcoming record, "People aren't going to get what they expect." 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Jimmy Page once described Led Zeppelin as "street music, rock 'n' 
roll." I, for one, know it's dangerous for rock's own survival to elevate this 
or any other kind of "street music" onto pedestals too high, but within the 
realm of rock 'n' roll, there's room for the recognition of bands that have 
made a contribution and a difference. Led Zeppelin is one of those bands and 
they deserve the respect as such. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to thank you for not outright associating the band with the term 
"heavy metal," although I believe the subtle message was there. It is 
imperative that Zeppelin be free from the chains of that misnomer. It is my 
hope that the next time you (mention) the band Led Zeppelin in an article that 
you would do so from a fresh perspective because the current one is old, worn 
and detrimentally untrue.
