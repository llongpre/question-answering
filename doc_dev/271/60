ROBERT HILBURN: 'RAINBOW WARRIORS' SMASHES SALES RECORDS IN THE SOVIET UNION

"Rainbow Warriors" was one of the biggest-selling albums of the year even 
before it hit the U.S. record shops this week. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the collection -- a two-record compilation featuring previously 
released tracks by more than two dozen of today's most prized rock acts -- has 
sold 4 million copies in the Soviet Union since it was released there on March 
6. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the phenomenal Soviet sales: "Rainbow Warriors" is a 
breakthrough in a country that has been notoriously slow to accept contemporary 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
While the collection is still not a total survey of what's happening today in 
rock (there's no heavy metal, rap or post-punk), the album does represent the 
first time Soviet record stores have carried an album that showcases what might 
best be described as "up-to-date rock." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, rock albums -- which have to be released in any quantity through 
Melodiya, the government record label -- have either been decade-old 
collections by the likes of the Beatles or Moody Blues or the special Paul 
McCartney package of '50s rockers. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the vinyl and cassette versions of "Rainbow Warriors" offers 27 
selections, including such socially conscious works as U2's "Pride (In the Name 
of Love)," Peter Gabriel's "Red Rain," Sting's "Love Is the Seventh Wave," 
R.E.M.'s "It's the End of the World As We Know It," Lou Reed's "Last Great 
American Whale" and Bruce Hornsby's "Look Out Any Window." In addition, the CD 
version contains four additional tracks, including Hothouse Flowers' "Hard 
Rain" and Robbie Robertson's "Somewhere Down the Crazy River." 
</P>
<P>
That sales explosion -- another million copies are expected to be sold in the 
Soviet Union by Christmas -- is exactly the excitement envisioned by the 
album's sponsor, Greenpeace, the international environmental advocacy 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We always had a lot of rock artists giving donations, but we hadn't actually 
approached them for support before," Cornelia Durrant, chairman of Greenpeace 
in England and one of the key figures behind the album, said during a recent 
interview in London. 
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace is very keyed to creating our own publicity, so we haven't needed 
to use celebrities in the past, but we felt we needed their help this time. 
These rock artists are literally worshipped by young people in Russia and we 
saw them as our ticket into the country. It was a way to raise funds for the 
Greenpeace chapter there and draw attention to our goals." 
</P>
<P>
Besides contributing tracks to the album, various bands -- most notably R.E.M. 
on its recent arena tour -- have been allowing Greenpeace volunteers to 
distribute informational material at their concerts. 
</P>
<P>
This involvement, in effect, has made Greenpeace the rock community's new 
charity of choice, assuming the position held in recent years by Amnesty 
International. The latter involvement was climaxed by an unprecedented 
five-continent tour featuring Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel and Sting. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Durrant said, the rash of rock benefits -- from Live Aid through 
the Amnesty tour -- had made Greenpeace wary of turning to the musicians for 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people use a particular device or method for promoting issues, the 
less effective it becomes over time. People get a bit bored with it. It's like, 
'Oh, here come the rock stars again . . . ' and they tune out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ian Flooks, one of England's leading rock agents and the album's executive 
producer, said the rock connection was perfect for what the organization wanted 
to do in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to find a way of raising money for Greenpeace outside of any 
government influence . . . as many individual donations from as large a number 
of people as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace had looked into doing a record a few years ago, but it did not seem 
possible. But this time, we found nothing but cooperation on the part of the 
Russians. Once we had it approved, we realized there was no reason why we 
shouldn't use it in as many countries as possible . . . raising more funds and 
raising awareness on a worldwide level. My objective is to make this the first 
record ever released in every country in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Sales in most countries aren't expected to match the hot pace of the Soviet 
Union figures, but they should be strong -- given the line-up that also 
includes such names as Sting, the Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, Simple Minds 
and John Cougar Mellencamp. The album was released in the United States by 
Geffen Records, and sales are expected to reach the 1 million level.

DRIVIN' N' CRYIN'/LINGERIE -- There's a song ("Honeysuckle Blue") on the new 
album by the rock group Drivin' N' Cryin' that is so wonderfully evocative that 
it alone was enough reason to check out the Atlanta quartet's appearance 
Thursday night at the Lingerie, where it opened for the recently reviewed House 
of Freaks. The song is a bittersweet tale of sad regret about lost ideals and 
endangered environment that has the fresh breath of a strong, original pop 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
But Drivin' N' Cryin' showed little of that distinctive style in the opening 
two-thirds of its hour set at the club, serving up instead some undernourished 
Led Zeppelin power-rock and some overstated Tom Petty roots-rock. 
</P>
<P>
The colorlessness of the music was underscored when the band, led by 
singer-songwriter Kevn Kinney, finally got around to "Honeysuckle Blue" and 
followed it with an equally rewarding "Straight to Hell." The latter is a 
country-accented story -- reminiscent of the Flying Burrito Brothers in its 
sense of naked emotion -- about a young boy being cast aside by his family and 
his town. 
</P>
<P>
There is such a gap between these songs and the rest of the band's set that the 
band ought to sit down and listen to a tape of the show and see which direction 
it wants to follow: the mostly colorless hard rock or the more engaging and 
original tone of "Honeysuckle Blue" and "Straight to Hell." If the vote ends up 
a tie, count this as an offer to cast the deciding vote.
