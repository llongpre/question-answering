   Rolling Stone magazine, long the definitive word
on rock 'n' roll, has chosen the 100 best singles of the past
quarter-century, and the magazine's name is high on the list.
   ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' by the Rolling Stones topped
the list, followed by Bob Dylan's ``Like a Rolling Stone.'' The
Beatles were third with ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand'' and its flip
side, ``I Saw Her Standing There.''
   The Rolling Stones hit the list three more times: at No. 27 with
``Honky Tonk Women''; at No. 68 with ``Jumpin' Jack Flash''; and at
No. 74 with ``Brown Sugar.''
   ``I actually didn't want it to be a single,'' said Keith
Richards, who invented the buzzing guitar riff for
``Satisfaction.'' He told Rolling Stone: ``I thought it was just
filler.''
   Richards said he wrote the guitar line in a motel in Clearwater,
Fla., during the band's U.S. tour in 1965.
   ``Like a Rolling Stone'' is Dylan's only recording in the top
100, though his ``All Along the Watchtower'' ranked 65th in the
version recorded by Jimi Hendrix and ``Mr. Tambourine Man,''
covered by The Byrds, was No. 86.
   ``Like a Rolling Stone'' broke through the three-minute format
of most 45s and set the rock world on the road to free-form FM.
   Unlike Richards, Dylan never suffered doubts about the quality
of his song. ``The first two lines which rhymed `kiddin' you' with
`didn't you' just about knocked me out; and later on, when I got to
the jugglers and the chrome horse and the princess on the steeple,
it all just about got to be too much,'' he said in a statement
given to the magazine.
   The Beatles also appear at No. 29 with ``Hey Jude''; No. 48 with
``Strawberry Fields Forever'' backed by ``Penny Lane''; and at No.
53 with ``Help!'' John Lennon's ``Imagine'' is No. 44 and his
``Instant Karma'' No. 79.
   The magazine, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year,
said it could easily have compiled a list of 100 great 45 rpm
recordings from the 1950s. However, it chose to go back to 1963 as
``a time of revitalization and reinvention in rock 'n' roll.''
   The highest-rated song from 1963 is ``Louie Louie,'' the
unintelligble garage-rock hit by the Kingsmen of Portland, Ore.
Other 1963 hits are ``Da Doo Ron Ron'' by the Crystals (No. 35) and
``Be My Baby'' by the Ronettes (No. 38), both produced by Phil
Spector.
   Rolling Stone's list was compiled by 25 rock critics and is in
the Sept. 8 edition, which goes on sale Tuesday.
   The rest of the Top 10:
   4. Marvin Gaye, ``I Heard it Through the Grapevine.''
   5. The Jackson Five, ``I Want You Back.''
   6. Aretha Franklin, ``Respect.''
   7. Otis Redding, ``The Dock of the Bay.''
   8. Creedence Clearwater Revival, ``Fortunate Son.''
   9. Bruce Springsteen, ``Born to Run.''
   10. The Supremes, ``Stop! in the Name of Love.''
   Springsteen's ``Born to Run,'' recorded in 1975, is the most
recent song in the Rolling Stone top 10.
   The 25 rock critics, including Rolling Stone editor and
publisher Jann Wenner, paid little homage to the king of rock 'n'
roll, Elvis Presley, putting his ``Suspicious Minds'' at No. 47.
   Of course, Presley's best recordings were mostly before 1963. So
were Chuck Berry's, whose later singles didn't make the list.
   There's more soft rock than hard rock _ hard rock always has
done better with fans than critics. Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way''
is No. 61, and Led Zeppelin's ``Whole Lotta Love'' is No. 96.
   The soft rock is mostly by groups, not individuals, and most of
the groups no longer exist: the Eagles, the Mamas and the Papas,
Buffalo Springfield, Fleetwood Mac, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young,
the Byrds and Lovin' Spoonful.
   Among those missing from the list are The Band, the Carpenters,
Linda Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell, Jim Croce, Boz Skaggs, Gordon
Lightfoot, the Monkees, Kris Kristofferson, Cat Stevens, Madonna,
Carly Simon, the Doobie Brothers and Cher, with or without Sonny.
   Paul Simon, who was in 71st place with the Simon and Garfunkel
hit ``Bridge Over Troubled Water,'' didn't place as a solo artist.
Neither did Tina Turner, who was No. 30 with ex-husband Ike Turner
with ``River Deep, Mountain High.''
