   At the Science Lab in midtown Manhattan, the same
studio where Irving Berlin composed standards, keyboardist David
Frank and singer Mic Murphy churn out funk.
   ``Don't Disturb This Groove'' and ``You're in My System'' won't
make anyone forget ``Blue Skies'' or ``White Christmas,'' but Frank
and Murphy, whose songs have climbed the charts, aren't complaining.
   Neither are Phil Collins, Phillip Bailey, Stevie Winwood, Chaka
Khan and Nona Hendryx, some of the artists who have received help _
songwriting or production _ from the two-man funk band appropriately
called The System.
   ``One day, the phone rang and I woke up and picked it up,'' Frank
recalled. ``Mic said, `I know what the name of the group should be.'
He said `The System.' I said I don't like that. I thought it should
be more colorful. The next morning, I called him and woke him up and
said I liked the name.''
   That was in 1982. Frank and Murphy had just met, written a song,
``In Times of Passion,'' and persuaded Atlantic Records to release
it. One problem: What should they call themselves? The
``Frank-Murphy Project'' was definitely out, it sounded too much
like an album-rock band. Murphy considered Fiberglass and This
Record Itches before thinking of The System and phoning Frank.
   ``It has so many meanings. It's political, the body, a manner of
the way things work together. We can go on. I was thinking, `Dave is
from Boston and I'm from Jamaica, Queens.' I used to say, `We are
America.' We have the whole spectrum on the East Coast,'' Murphy
said.
   Names matter, Frank and Murphy insist. When they start writing a
song, the title often comes first; music and lyrics are filled in.
That's why ballads are rare for The System. Working titles such as
``Groove'' and ``You're in My System'' just don't seem right for
slow songs. Neither do ``Midnight Special'' nor ``Wicked,'' tracks
off their new album ``Rhythm &amp; Romance.''
   ``A lot of times we'll fit things together,'' Frank said. ``The
Beatles used to do exactly the same thing: `Let's just take this
bridge and inject it into this song.'''
   Their childhoods had little in common, except a love for music.
Frank grew up in the Roxbury section of Boston, literally on the
wrong side of the tracks.
   ``I lived at the edge of town,'' Frank said, ``and WLIB was the
only R&amp;B station in the Boston area and only during daylight hours.
Right when we crossed into our town, I'd be listening to my mother's
car radio and it would fade out and we'd get a Top 40 station from
Baltimore.''
   While Frank had to fumble with the radio dial to hear the music
he loved, rhythm and blues was practically in Murphy's backyard. The
local barbershop was owned by the father of future Funkadelic
guitarist Eddie Hazel and several other aspiring funk stars _ Eddie
Martinez, Marcus Miller and Ronnie Drayton _ were in the
neighborhood.
   ``I was in bands when I was 10 or 11,'' Murphy recalled. ``
`Little Mic and the Soulshakers.' We played a lot of social clubs
and dances at the time. My parents and their friends went to these
clubs and because we were the only young kids who had a band, we got
to play every weekend.
   ``People would say, `They're so cute.' We were getting paid 50
bucks a night. We'd be the midnight floor show. We'd play all the
new songs and the audences loved it. We were like the local Jackson
5.''
   Frank, meanwhile, was being groomed for a more highbrow career,
studying classical piano at the New England Conservatory and
Berkeley College of Music. Rock 'n' roll won out, but he did not
forget his early training.
   ``It affects the way I think of music,'' Frank said. ``I'll refer
to a song as a concerto, a vocal concerto.''
   ``That's what happened with `Don't Disturb This Groove,''' Murphy
added. ``That's the first movement. `Soul to Soul' on this album is
the second movement.''
   The Sytem has other influences, including the Rolling Stones, Sly
and the Family Stone, Parliament-Funkadelic and Led Zeppelin. Frank
and Murphy's musical tastes ranged so wide, they at first had no
idea into which radio format or formats their songs would fit.
   ``We'd never been on a chart,'' Frank said. ``I looked at the
label and saw our names as producers and thought, `So that's what
producuers do.' We didn't have any plan in mind. We just did it were
getting paid more money than we had ever gotten before.''
