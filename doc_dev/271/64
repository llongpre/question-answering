POP EYE: THE WORST OF '88. . . FROM THE BOTTOM UP

Had enough of Top Ten lists? 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. . . . it's time for Pop Eye's ninth annual Bottom 10, a collection of 
1988's biggest critical flops. We've polled 40 writers, deejays, record execs, 
managers, musicians and rank 'n' file music fans for their picks for this 
coveted Dean's List of Decrepit Discs. 
</P>
<P>
The year's biggest stink bomb? By a wide margin, the winner was ex-Led Zeppelin 
guitarist Jimmy Page's much-maligned solo album, "Outrider." As one voter 
complained: "It sounded like the kind of bad Zep imitation you'd hear from a 
Holiday Inn lounge act." It's Page's second swing through the Bottom 10 -- he 
made 1985's all-worst list as a member of the Firm. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year for big-star belly flops. Page was joined on the Bottom 10 by 
David Lee Roth (who one voter blasted as "almost as tacky as Geraldo Rivera"), 
Huey Lewis &amp; the News and aging veterans Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
This year's voters also nailed Zep-imitators Kingdom Come, boorish headbangers 
Poison, all-gal metal group Vixen ("What a concept -- Lita Ford quintuplets") 
and shock-comic Sam Kinison, who cracked the Bottom 5 thanks to widespread 
outrage over his "Wild Thing" video (which one voter claimed "is so sexist, it 
makes Motley Crue's clips look like Snow White cartoons"). 
</P>
<P>
There were no other repeat offenders from past years, though the Bottom 10 had 
its first sound-track entry -- "More Dirty Dancing" -- since the 1984 poll, 
which featured "Metropolis." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, voters suggested all sorts of oddity choices, including Glenn Frey 
("Worst haircut in rock 'n roll"), Robert Palmer ("I hope he drowns in 
Pomade!") the "Cocktail" sound track (for spotlighting the Beach Boys' drippy 
"Kokomo" single) and Duran Duran ("Their videos do to women what the Brazilians 
are doing to tropical rain forests"). 
</P>
<P>
Narrowly missing the final cut, but getting enough votes to merit honorable 
mention were albums by: Rick Astley, George Michael, Glenn Frey, Taylor Dayne, 
White Lion, Hall &amp; Oates, Bon Jovi, Robert Palmer, the Fat Boys, Robert 
Plant, Kenny Loggins, Olivia Newton-John, Breathe, Duran Duran, Boz Scaggs and 
Steve Miller.
