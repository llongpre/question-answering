<P>
 Faithful viewers of MTV, it's time once again to temporarily cease and desist 
from being a lethargic couch potato and get in on some of the on-screen action 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, the North County Fair shopping center in 
Escondido will this week host MTV's Museum of UnNatural History, a traveling 
road show of pop music, culture, fashion and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Step inside the 3,000-square-foot museum, set up Thursday through Sunday in the 
mall's central walkway, and you'll get a firsthand look at the MTV life style 
through more than 20 displays, grouped in four areas: 
</P>
<P>
* In the "New Music" section, a wall of 16 television monitors, stacked into a 
square, will broadcast the latest music videos from established artists as well 
as promising upstarts. Visitors will also get the chance to make their own 
videos, using MTV cameras, stages and props. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Long Live Rock" exhibit will display rock 'n' roll memorabilia on loan 
from the Hard Rock Cafe collection. There will be gold records, rare 
photographs, autographs, clothes and guitars from such pop heroes as Keith 
Richards, Bon Jovi, George Michael, Joan Jett, the Fat Boys and the Traveling 
Wilburys (Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison). 
</P>
<P>
New this year is a painting of what, from up close, looks like an aquarium full 
of fish. But stand back and what suddenly emerges is the face of the late Jim 
Morrison. MTV commissioned artist Doug Auld to paint the portrait. Auld will be 
on hand to sign autographs all four days the museum is in town. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Addicted to Style" section celebrates the latest pop fashion and beauty 
trends. The highlight promises to be the campy 3-D "Gone Fishing" display, a 
series of moving scenes that will show you the right look for leisure-time 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Products for Better Living" area will showcase the latest in pop 
technology through a variety of commercially sponsored displays. Among them are 
Sunkist Soft Drinks' "Make Your Own Surf Video" booth, which will give museum 
visitors the chance to be videotaped aboard a simulated surfboard; a 
nickelodeon with continuous showings of Hershey's animated Twizzlers licorice 
promotional clip; and Designamics' exhibit of innovative inventions that have 
yet to catch on, like the amphibious car. 
</P>
<P>
The star attraction: "Robo Doc's Body Shop," will take a futuristic look at 
automobile-repair garages, complete with a greasy-fingered robot mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
On last year's inaugural tour of shopping centers throughout the country, MTV's 
Museum of UnNatural History was visited by more than 5 million people, and host 
malls reported traffic increases of 5% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
This year's 28-week, 24-city cross-country swing began in March in Durham, 
N.C., and concludes next month in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, almost to the day, Blue Oyster Cult headlined a sold-out show at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium attended by more than 50,000 screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently most of those screams have long since been silenced. When the 
pioneering New York heavy metal band returns to San Diego this week, it will be 
for a two-night stand, Thursday and Friday, at the 500-seat Bacchanal in Kearny 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall of Blue Oyster Cult, described by the Rolling Stone 
Encyclopedia of Rock 'n' Roll as "semi-satiric exponents of the high-decibel 
apocalypse," is a testament to the inherent fickleness of pop-music audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Blue Oyster Cult helped usher in the first wave of heavy 
metal with such savage head-banging anthems as "Tyranny and Mutation," "Cities 
on Flame" and "Hot Rails to Hell." 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the live "On Your Feet or On Your Knees" LP became the group's first 
gold album, and a year later, after adopting a less explosive, more mainstream 
pop sound, they scored their first Top 40 single with "(Don't Fear) The 
Reaper." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1970s and early '80s, Blue Oyster Cult continued to do quite 
well, both on the charts and on the concert trail. 
</P>
<P>
But, in recent years, the group's place in the hearts of heavy metal fans has 
been taken over by newer, younger bands like Bon Jovi, Guns 'n' Roses and Great 
White. Blue Oyster Cult's last hit album was 1982's "Extraterrestrial Live," 
and their last Top 40 single was 1981's "Burnin' For You." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other first-generation heavy metal bands like Led Zeppelin and Grand 
Funk Railroad, however, Blue Oyster Cult has steadfastly refused to give up. 
</P>
<P>
And, from the sounds of their last couple of albums, they're still able to 
raise as much commotion as their younger, more commercially successful 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diego techno-pop duo Red Flag, whose debut album, "Naive Art,"
