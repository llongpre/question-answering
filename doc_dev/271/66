   A Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young reunion is
planned, and performers will include Mick Jagger and Robert Plant
as Atlantic Records enters middle age with an 11-hour 40th
anniversary party.
   ``This label, perhaps more than any other, followed the move
from R'n'B to rock 'n' roll,'' said Ken Erlich, who will produce
the May 14 show in Madison Square Garden. ``It's a microcosm of
American music from the past 40 years.''
   Among the past and present Atlantic Records performers scheduled
to participate are ex-Who guitarist Peter Townshend and his
vocalist partner Roger Daltrey; Rolling Stones Jagger and Keith
Richards; Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd; drummer Phil Collins as a solo
and with Genesis; Ben E. King; '60s psychedelic acts Vanilla Fudge
and Iron Butterfly; and former Led Zeppelin bandmates Plant and
Jimmy Page, according to a release.
   A CSN&amp;Y reunion is slated, as is a reunion of the remaining
Rascals.
   ``It seems like only yesterday we set up shop in the old
Jefferson Hotel on 56th and Broadway,'' said Atlantic Records
Chairman of the Board Ahmet Ertegun, who co-founded the company in
1948.
   The show, to be televised live on HBO for the final four hours,
pays tribute to a label with an artist roster covering disparate
acts such as innovative jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman and teen
popster Debbie Gibson.
   The show will be divided into four segments, said Erlich, who
has produced several Grammy telecasts as well as last year's
Vietnam veterans show in Washington.
   ``One segment will be dedicated entirely to the Atlantic
classics,'' said Erlich, ticking them off: ``Stand By Me,''
``Stairway to Heaven,'' ``(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay,''
``Woodstock,'' ``In A Gadda Da Vida.''
   A limited number of tickets for the show will be available to
the public sometime soon. Any profits will be donated to charities
selected by the performers.
