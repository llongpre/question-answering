If it were the movies, rocker Melissa Etheridge would be what is called the 
strong female lead -- perhaps Sigourney Weaver beating up those slimy "aliens." 
She's got a voice as big as all outdoors, sort of like Pat Benatar on steroids, 
and Etheridge rocks as hard as any of those guys in leather pants. 
</P>
<P>
The Beatles may have sung ". . . all you need is love," but the love Etheridge 
sings about, nobody needs. It's angst with a beat, rocky relationships that 
rock. But you'll probably be too busy dancing to hang yourself. She has a hot 
band behind her featuring, among others, Bernie Larsen on guitar. Feeling bad 
never sounded so good. 
</P>
<P>
From "Let Me Go," a sample line: 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I the snake inside your garden 
</P>
<P>
 The sugar in your tea 
</P>
<P>
 The knock upon your backdoor 
</P>
<P>
 The twist that turns your key 
</P>
<P>
 Am I the sweat you feel on your hand 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow on your face 
</P>
<P>
 The tune inside your head that put you 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the first place 
</P>
<P>
 Well I don't want to be . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Etheridge, from Leavenworth, Kan., is on a roll with two gold albums. The 
self-titled 1988 debut earned her a Grammy nomination. The second album, "Brave 
and Crazy," was released in 1989, also on Island Records. 
</P>
<P>
Etheridge, 29, will make her local debut when she plays the tree-lined Santa 
Barbara County Bowl on Saturday night along with local rock heroes Toad the Wet 
Sprocket. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview, she had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
When can we expect a new album? 
</P>
<P>
Well, we're going into the studio in February. It'll probably be another year. 
</P>
<P>
Will you be playing any new songs at the concert? 
</P>
<P>
Well, that depends on the crowd -- sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in the music business? 
</P>
<P>
I've been in the music business ever since I could walk. It didn't come from my 
family -- it wasn't a musical family. I got into music from records I bought 
and from listening to the radio. WHB was our station in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Who were some of your musical influences? 
</P>
<P>
Most of it was pop music from the '60s -- the Beatles, Tommy James &amp; the 
Shondells and, later, Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
You've toured extensively the last couple of years; where are most of the 
Melissa fans? 
</P>
<P>
Wow, Montreal, Canada, I guess; I'm a huge star up there. I'm also popular in 
Australia, New York, Colorado and California. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a basic Melissa fan, and is it a serious, young female English lit 
major-type dressed in black? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it used to be like that, young, female, between 20 and 30 years old, 
working or in college, but not so much anymore. I'm attracting everybody now 
and that's really exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Was J. Geils right; does love stink? 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you can't deal with it, it can. But it's not so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Does bad love make good songs? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, but it's my challenge to make a common experience into a good song. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Nilsson once wrote a song called "Joy" in the early '70s. It had a line 
in it that said, "If everyone was happy, there wouldn't be any love songs. . . 
." Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
That's true. As songwriters, we tend to deal with conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
How would you describe Melissa music? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's rock 'n' roll. Hopefully, it's an intense performance of feelings 
and emotions that we all experience. 
</P>
<P>
What do you say when people tell you, "Melissa, lighten up"? 
</P>
<P>
I say now wait a minute, I'm not actually just complaining about things. I 
believe it's important to speak out and talk about things. That's the problem 
with the world today, we don't talk; we just push things under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
Can music change the world? 
</P>
<P>
I think it has, it can and it will. I want my audience to leave with more than 
they came with. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best thing about being a rock goddess? 
</P>
<P>
Getting free desserts at restaurants. Also, I'm able to do what I want. 
</P>
<P>
What was your strangest gig? 
</P>
<P>
Playing at a supermarket opening in Leavenworth, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
You live in Los Angeles; how about those Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
Who? 
</P>
<P>
How about those Royals? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, I do care about the Royals -- they're my hometown team.
