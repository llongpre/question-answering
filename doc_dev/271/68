   You start with the name: the Kentucky
Headhunters.
   Images of barefoot, spear-carrying ruffians in loincloth.
   ``It makes people think we're wild, naked hillbillies,'' says
Richard Young, a member of the five-member band from Glasgow, Ky.,
whose music is as intriguing as their name. The five are a newly
signed recording group who play country, rock 'n' roll, bluegrass,
blues and jazz.
   ``We offer a blend of Merle Haggard, Bill Monroe and Led
Zeppelin,'' says Doug Phelps, whose brother, Ricky Lee, also plays
in the group.
   ``Basically what we're doing is taking bluegrass music and
making it jazzy,'' Young says. ``John Lennon has done it and all
those people over there. They would take a bluegrass song and make
it up-tempo.''
   Now about the name.
   The group, nicknamed ``the Heads,'' took the name from a music
term believed to have originated from the blues great Muddy Waters.
The term ``headhunters'' apparently came about when Waters' band
displaced local, less proficient groups as Waters' band toured the
country.
   The proud Kentuckians added their state to the term and their
memorable name was born.
   ``This is the first thing that catches everybody's attention,''
Ricky Lee Phelps says.
   Says Young: ``I called one guy at a radio station and he said he
opened our record just because of the name. He said it sounded like
something out of National Geographic.''
   Adds group member Greg Martin with a chuckle: ``We've got
everybody scared to death. They think, `Headhunters!'''
   The group, whose members are in their late 20s to mid-30s, has
been together four years. Their first Mercury-Polygram album is
``Pickin' on Nashville'' and the first single released from the LP
is ``Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine.''
   The band consists of four guitars and drums and occasionally an
harmonica.
   ``It's aggressive music, but it's a bunch of hillbillies playing
it,'' Ricky Lee Phelps says.
   Drummer Fred Young, Richard's brother, says: ``We all grew up
using the outhouse.''
   ``We've all run out of toilet paper out there,'' Richard adds.
   The band plays a mixture of music ranging from Jimi Hendrix's
``Wait 'til Tomorrow,'' to Cream's ``Crossroads,'' and country
standards such as ``Oh Lonesome Me'' and ``Wildwood Flower.'' They
close their performances by saluting their home state with ``My Old
Kentucky Home.''
   Ricky Lee Phelps adds an entertaining touch to their
performances by pulling an array of props out of a trunk on stage.
   ``It's full of toys,'' he says. ``I've got water guns in there
and I wet people down. I pull out a phone and talk to Elvis. I've
got some magic tricks and I throw out cheap novelties to the
crowd.''
   He also juggles bowling pins. ``Four is the most I can do, and
three is plenty.''
   Fred Young often plays drums shirtless, borrowing the idea from
other drummers he's seen. It also saves time when he's through
playing.
   ``I've been playing this way all my life. It gets hot back there
and you don't want to jump in the shower afterwards with your
clothes on.''
   Their instruments are as unpretentious as the musicians playing
them. They've disdained state-of-the-art guitars and drums for
instruments that are 20 years old and older.
   ``These drums are a complete different sound,'' Fred Young says
about his set, which has ``Metcalfe County High School'' proudly
printed on them. ``I don't ever remember tuning them.''
   Before the Phelps brothers joined the group, the band was known
as Itchy Brothers. This name was borrowed from the King Leonardo
cartoon show in which Itchy was King Leonardo's evil brother.
   ``It was a good name,'' Richard Young says. ``We thought about
keeping it. The Kentucky Headhunters are an extension of it.''
