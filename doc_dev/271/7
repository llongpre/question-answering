   For the first time in his solo career, Robert
Plant, who sang lead in Led Zeppelin for two decades, pays a
musical salute to the group that ended its reign in rock 'n' roll
when drummer John ``Bonzo'' Bonham died after a European tour in
1980.
   On his latest LP, ``Now and Zen,'' Plant has lifted guitar
riffs, bridges and musical phrases the group once used in their hot
tunes and inserted them into his new work. At the end of ``White,
Clean and Neat,'' Plant sings a bit of ``Since I've Been Loving
You'' _ a hit for Led Zeppelin in 1970. On stage, he puts some of
Zep's ``Custard Pie'' from the ``Physical Graffiti'' LP on the end
of ``Tall Cool One.''
   Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page also plays on Plant's first
single, ``Heaven Knows,'' and ``Tall Cool One,'' the current
single. Plant co-wrote and sang ``The Only One'' on ``Outrider,''
the new album Page has after years of semi-retirment.
   ``I'm tipping my hat, looking back,'' Plant said in an
interview. ``I've had kind of a mental block on that whole period.
Now I have no problem with it at all. I think it was crucial to
distance myself, just for my own integrity. I didn't know it was
going to happen like this. I thought I would forever be a little
reluctant and reticent but I see now that it's OK.
   ``I think this solo record is about the nearest I've got to
succeeding on nearly all levels. This is the most commercial and
attractive. It's the happiest record I've made probably in my
life.''
   Most of the musical references to Led Zeppelin are on the
fadeouts of tracks and they're done by a synthesizer briefly
recreating the Zeppelin music. Plant said now is a good time to
have a record out because there's a renewed interest in Led
Zeppelin.
   ``I think the time seems to be appropriate right now,'' he said.
``That's all right by me. My father always tells me, `Be thankful
for all mercies.''' Plant's father was a civil engineer in
Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, where he was born almost 40 years
ago.
   ``It's an interest in the music of the '70s, but we were from
the '60s,'' Plant said. ``It's sad, really, because I thought
somebody could have come up with something else by now.
   ``There are other things around. But there is also a lot of the
Led Zeppelin thing about. It would be nice to get something with
that kind of intent _ that thing, whatever it was that we had _
instead of all these impersonators trying to get somewhere near us
and generally missing by a good mile.''
   On ``Now and Zen,'' Plant has new partners: Phil Johnstone and
Dave Barrett, two young songwriters whose publisher sent Plant a
demo tape.
   ``I think the whole thing is a lot fresher,'' he said. ``It has
been a revival for me within myself, never mind within the industry.
   ``I just wanted to get songs. Then I could see what could happen
next. Of all the 100 or 120 tapes that had been sent me, I found
this one little old baby cassette tape had got the very essence of
what I wanted to do musically and what I've always felt that I
represented musically.
   ``There it was in its virgin splendor, `Heaven Knows,' with a
girl singing it. Virgin Publishing sent it. It was sent by some
astute lackey publisher's boy who knew that this was what everybody
else didn't know. Most publishers are hawking anything they can,
irrespective of whether it's the right thing for the job.
   ``It had some intrigue and some kind of mood that you don't get
on a pop record generally. You hear it sometimes on a Kate Bush or
Peter Gabriel record,'' Plant said.
   ``I arranged a meeting with Johnstone and Barrett. They arrived
late enough to be cool but not to be aggressive. It was really good
because they were arrogant and not impressed.
   ``From that meeting the three of us got together in Barrett's
bedroom, set up the computers and started chattering our way
through the first two songs that we wrote together. Barrett turned
knobs and stuff while Phil and myself wrote `White, Clean and Neat'
and `Tall Cool One.'''
   That was in December 1986. A band was assembled by March 1987;
final songs were written by the band, and recording started in May.
   Plant launched a U.S. tour in May. ``I think it's time to tour
and tour and tour and tour and tour and play and celebrate this new
thing and write the next album during the process of celebration.''
   The group goes to Europe in September, and might extend the tour
to the Orient and Australia.
   Plant turns 40 on Aug. 20, and had these observations about his
birthday: ``There's no deterioration anywhere particularly, a few
visual marks, a few fenders may need a little bit of adjustment
here and there. But the spirit and body and the man is doing fine
so it's of no consequence.
   ``I know it sounds corny but basically I'm thrilled and I'm glad
to be around.''
