Those countries trying to establish themselves as new democracies well might 
take a lesson from guitarist Scott Henderson and his band, Tribal Tech. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a major band meeting the other night," Henderson, 35, said last 
week from his home in Highland Park. "Everybody was calling me and complaining 
about one of my pieces, saying it was boring to play." 
</P>
<P>
Though half the members of Tribal Tech have been in the group less than a month 
(keyboardist John Beasley and drummer Joey Heredia have joined Henderson and 
bassist Gary Willis), Henderson listened. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to delete some material" from the song, he said, "make it more fun 
to play. We're always trying to open up the music." The band plays at Hamptons 
in Santa Ana on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has plenty of empathy for the sideman's role: He has been there. 
Currently a member Joe Zawinul's Zawinul Syndicate, he has also played with the 
likes of Chick Corea (who, he said, "has got more rhythm in him than any 
musician I've ever met") and Jean-Luc Ponty. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great player," Henderson said of the French violinist, "but playing 
that music every night is no fun for the musicians. When someone's soloing . . 
. you have a part to play, just like a sequencer. It's so inhuman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's stupid for a band to be one person's concept only," Henderson 
continued. "It's boring for the other musicians. We're just using my name 
because I have the highest visibility right now." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, there's more than democratic ideals behind Tribal Tech. The band's 
latest album, "Nomad," on the Relativity label, is an electric excursion into 
jazz, rock and world-beat, a thick, rhythmic mix whose melodic lines echo such 
better-known bands as Corea's and Zawinul's. Henderson's title cut and another 
of his pieces called "Rituals" both could provide a perfect soundtrack for the 
record's cover art: a group of Indians sitting around a fire listening to a 
shiny, futuristic Robocop figure in a headdress. 
</P>
<P>
"The tribal part of our band isn't so much tribal but traditional," Henderson 
said. "Seeing a mix of the old and the new is a favorite thing of mine, 
something that's really romantic for me. I just went to Tokyo -- it's my 
favorite city -- and it's like that there. You see the old culture mixed in 
with just tons of neon, like that 'Blade Runner' thing." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said Zawinul's sound has had an impact on his own. But, he added: 
"I'm trying not to let him influence me too much. I don't want the band to be a 
Weather Report clone. And I don't think it ever could, because there's too much 
rock 'n' roll influence in my background." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson wasn't hearing John Coltrane and Wes Montgomery around the house 
while he was growing up. "No, man, I heard Led Zeppelin, I grew up listening to 
rock 'n' roll. I didn't even listen to jazz until I was 22 or 23 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of guys, he admitted that when he first picked up a guitar, back in 
the 10th grade, he was trying to impress girls. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first jazz album he heard was drummer Billy Cobham's 1973 
rock-influenced "Spectrum," he quickly moved on. "I'd have to say the fusion 
thing influenced me the least, was just a steppingstone that led to straight 
ahead," he said. "The change was real fast for me. I discovered the old Miles 
Davis albums with Wayne Shorter and Tony Williams. It's still my favorite jazz 
band ever." 
</P>
<P>
He has no misconceptions about the type of music he plays. "I was talking to 
John Patitucci once on the Chick Corea tour bus," Henderson said, "and he was 
saying how he hated fusion and that he didn't want to be in a fusion band. I 
was thinking, 'Man, that's what you're in right now.' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of musicians have a real hatred of that word. You can't really blame 
them, because there are so many lame fusion bands. But I think fusion is the 
perfect word for what we do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not straight ahead, we're not rock. We're influenced by R&amp;B and 
funk. I'm influenced heavily by (former Deep Purple guitarist) Ritchie 
Blackmore, (guitarists) Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, the cats that I grew up 
listening to. That's what fusion is, a mixing of one or more elements. But 
because we're a fusion band, it doesn't mean we're lame." 
</P>
<P>
The new band is working on an album ("Nomad" was recorded in 1988) and hopes to 
tour later this spring before Henderson goes on the road with Zawinul. 
Meanwhile, the struggle for musical liberation continues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're headed a bit more into the improvisation side of things," Henderson 
said. "We're less structured live than on the record. A lot of people aren't 
aware of what a struggle it is for a musician to maintain a balance between 
freedom and structure. It's like the guy who wants to be single and, at the 
same time, wants to be married. It's a constant battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Henderson and Tribal Tech play Monday at 8 p.m. at Hamptons, 3503 S. 
Harbor Blvd., Santa Ana. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714) 979-5511.
