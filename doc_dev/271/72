   Soviet youth poured into Moscow to hear American
heavy metal heroes Sunday but 10,000 security men and rockers with
``Just Say Nyet'' buttons kept the concert from getting too
intoxicating.
   ``If the police weren't here, there would be drugs and drinking
and making love,'' said Anna Rvinskaya, an 18-year-old Moscow
mother dressed in the metal bracelets and tight, short blue-jean
skirt favored by her motorcycle gang.
   ``But what can you do with police everywhere?'' she shrugged.
   And they were everywhere, among the 100,000 people gathered for
the second day of ear-shattering heavy metal sounds from the likes
of Bon Jovi, Scorpions and Ozzy Osbourne. It was Moscow's biggest
festival of foreign rock music, which for years was condemned as an
infectious item of Western decadence.
   Moscow militia in blue, riot police in black, KGB agents in dark
civilian clothes and young toughs in uniform track suits and
T-shirts lined the stage and aisles throughout the packed Lenin
Stadium in Moscow's Luzhniki District.
   Soviet impresario Stas Namin said he and the foreign organizers
of the concert had requested the overwhelming security. He said
Soviet authorities have never allowed so many young people to
gather in one place, and they didn't know what to expect.
   Authorities might be suffer extra anxiety since the crowd came
dressed in chains and skin-tight leather.
   Motley Crue incited the crowd to scream obscenities in English,
which Soviet government television broadcast nationwide in its
coverage of ``fragments'' of the concert. And some fans shed their
clothes for a brief streak across the stands.
   But mountains of vodka bottles piled up outside the stadium, and
suggestions of more outrageous behavior remained onstage.
   It was an appropriate action for a concert billed as an
anti-drug and anti-alcohol event. Many rockers wore buttons
emblazoned, ``Just Say Nyet.''
   The audience poured into Moscow from all over the Soviet Union.
Oleg Galkin of Astrakhan said he hitchhiked for 48 hours to reach
the festival, and he doesn't even like heavy metal.
   ``I would rather have heard Led Zeppelin, Dire Straits or Pink
Floyd,'' he said.
   Hundreds of youths who could not afford the scalpers' price of
up to $112 a ticket milled around outside the stadium. But no
matter _ the music could be heard a half-mile away.
   Motorcycle gangs, rarely seen on the streets of Moscow, showed
off tattoos, brass knuckles and flags of the American Confederacy.
   They were joined by frumpy grandmothers and officials in
business suits sitting stiffly in a stadium full of singing,
screaming and dancing fans.
   Other rockers in the two-day festival, broadcast in the United
States on pay television Sunday, were Cinderella and Skid Row from
the West and Nuance and Brigada S from the Soviet Union.
