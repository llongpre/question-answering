<LEADPARA>  LET'S get one thing straight from the start: I have nothing against the
municipality of Berkeley. It is home to some beautiful architecture, some
mighty fine restaurants and a pretty good university. I just find it odd that
a city infamous for radical politics can be so downright un-progressive when
it comes to folk music.;    Now some fuzzy-brained, whole-grained,
"politically correct" people of the more-righteous-than-thou variety may not
want to accept this painful truth -- coming from me, a running-dog lackey of
the oppressive corporate-journalism power structure. But comrades, your cozy
little coffeehouse scene is about as radical as a Pat Boone sock hop.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The last three years have witnessed an explosion of new, imaginative folk
and acoustic rock in San Francisco's underground club scene. And for the first
time in a generation, a legion of young, earnest, honest-to-Leadbelly,
guitar-strumming folkies are selling records and packing halls with fresh
approaches to traditional music. But you're far more likely to find the
cutting edge of folk music in a South of Market biker bar than in a Berkeley
coffeehouse. Because by and large, the rag-tag, raised-on-rock new school is
about as welcome in the coffeehouses as a GOP fund-raiser. The tweedy,
orthodox old-line folk community has not exactly been bustin' itself in a rush
to embrace its bastard offspring.;    A recent Saturday night show by the
Movie Stars and the Genuine Diamelles at Freight &amp; Salvage, Berkeley's
premiere folk venue, was a small but important sign that the inter-sectarian
ice may be melting.;    Freight and Salvage, a non-profit operation run by the
Berkeley Society for the Preservation of Traditional Music, is about as far
away from the raucous South of Market scene as these two bands could get. The
antiquated bare-bones venue -- which hosts folk, bluegrass, blues and jazz six
nights a week -- is essentially an anti-rock-club. No dancing, no fancy
lights, no smoking, no booze (although they do serve beer on occasion) and --
pu-leeeze -- no loud music.;    A passer-by walking through the rough-hewn
wooden doors might think they'd stumbled across a Saturday night church
service by some very liberal denomination. Votive candles were scattered
around the room and by 8:30 about 50 silent folk aficionados, ages 7 to 70,
filled the rows of ragtag chairs facing the plain stage. Onstage, an
unannounced, all-too-precious guitar-and-cello duo sounded dangerously close
to the hilarious "Saturday Night Live" folkie-spoof, "Pemberton and Flam.";   
For a place that dispenses coffee, there seemed to be an alarming number of
people close to nodding off. And there were enough grim-looking
post-collegiate men with berets and fishermen sweaters to fill a mid-size
Greek village.;    The Genuine Diamelles, introduced as "San Francisco's
Psychedelic Glee Club," were able to pump the laconic crowd for a pretty
decent number of laughs. The band's winning brand of a cappella lunacy ranged
from doo-wop arrangements of Johnny Otis and Led Zeppelin classics to original
songs dealing with everything from dirty pigeons to killer poodles. If the
Marx Brothers sang harmony and had a knock-out sister like Debbie Tennerino
for a lead, they'd probably sound like the Diamelles.;    The Movie Stars'
semi-acoustic set was politely received, but the quintet's obvious rock 'n'
roll origins were a bit too raw for this crowd to swallow. Although the band
uses orthodox folk instruments (pedal steel guitar, accordion, mandolin, etc.)
the results are often anything but orthodox. Bassist/vocalist Jill Olson's
warm voice is somewhere on the spectrum between Dusty Springfield and Judy
Collins. Her loopy sense of humor is entirely off the spectrum.;    She
likened playing in Berkeley to "having sex in another room of the house. It's
-- you know -- different." Nobody laughed. "Ah, you can say 'sex' here, can't
you?" she asked gamely. Irreverence, it seems, is not prized in these parts.;
