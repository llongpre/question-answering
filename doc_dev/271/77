FREE SPEECH II: Rock's leading heavy-metal voice, RIP magazine, also takes on 
anti-rock crusaders with its September "Rock Censorship Special" issue. (The 
magazine's cover is a classic, featuring Ozzy Osbourne with a warning sticker 
plastered over his mouth.)

The issue features a host of artist perspectives on censorship from the likes 
of Metallica's Lars Ulrich, Jane's Addiction's Perry Farrell, Frank Zappa and 
Axl Rose, who sagely notes that everybody knows "that the Mona Lisa is art -- 
well, so is Led Zeppelin." But our favorite quote comes from Ozzy, who has been 
taken to court by parents alleging that his song "Suicide Solution" caused a 
teen-ager to take his life. Bemoaning the fact that he's always been the focus 
of anti-rock tirades, Ozzy complains: "When I die, it will be 'There lies Ozzy 
Osbourne, who sent more people to their graves than Adolf Hitler!' . . . Just 
last week someone else shot himself and has blamed me! I believe in God. I am 
not a devil worshiper. My kids don't sleep in the attic, hanging upside down on 
rafters."
