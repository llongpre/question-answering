Plant Across America: Four months into his U.S. tour, former Led Zeppelin 
singer Robert Plant is visiting a series of places not frequented by major rock 
tours. In accordance with the change of venue, Plant has changed the name of 
his tour from the "Manic Nirvana Tour" of North America to "The Tour That Time 
Forgot." Plant, who has pledged to play "where no commercially aware musical 
outfit dares to tread," will perform in November in such burgs as Laramie, 
Wyo.; Sioux City, Iowa; Rapid City, S.D.; Joplin, Mo.; and Muskogee, Okla.
