<LEADPARA>  SHOULD anyone need concrete proof we're living in the age of elliptical
ironies, one need look no further than the unlikely success of Dread Zeppelin.
If the dubious concept of a young band specializing in Led Zeppelin covers is
hip, then it follows that a young band specializing in reggae versions of Led
Zeppelin covers would be hip to the second power, no? Furthermore (hang on
here, this next curve is a killer), if a young band specializing in reggae
versions of Led Zeppelin covers is already doubly ironic -- adding a lead
singer who's a dead ringer for the late, great and overweight Elvis Presley
would make it ironic to the third power. What have we learned  from this,
class? I(s3) &equals; Dread Zeppelin.;    If you have the perverse call to see an
Elvis impersonator as big as a dirigible skanking around the stage to the tune
of "Misty Mountain Hop" played at half-speed, you can catch the band tonight
at the Catalyst, Saturday at the Omni and Sunday at the San Jose Oasis.  </LEADPARA>

report they were turned down this week on their offer to entertain troops in
Operation Desert Shield, "even though we promised to wear veils."); (hbox);   
On the downtown beat: Max and June Stanley, the brother-sister team behind the
J.J.'s blues mini-empire, signed the lease on the site of their third club
Wednesday. Expect to see a 200-300 seat J.J.'s on South Second Street in San
Jose within three months. And, right next door, expect to see a 200-capacity
rock 'n' roll piano bar run by Steve Hoey and Kevin Murphy of the Oasis
nightclub chain. The lease is being negotiated now, and if all goes well the
club -- their third operation -- could be running in six months.;    The
proposed Main Event nightclub appears to be on hold yet again. The project,
originally intended for San Jose's South First Street, probably won't be
moving into Studio 47 as its backers had hoped. Studio 47, near San Pedro
Square, liked the two Main Event trial shows so much it hired its own in-house
booker to manage a regular Thursday night series of hard rock. (Vixen, Flame
and Freewill are slated for this week.) "We  went in there with the very best
of intentions for turning Studio 47 into the Main Event," said disappointed
Main Event partner Rene Duenas, "and I think we got a raw deal. We really
question the business methods of Russell Gunter" (the club's new in-house
booker).;    This week's top tickets: The Kingpins hold court Saturday at
Number One Broadway. The 'Pins -- now in about their 10th configuration -- are
sounding better than ever. Vocalist Marshan Barr, a virtual icon of suavity,
was born to croon the ancient jump 'n' jive R&amp;B classics in the band's current
lineup. Now if only they'd add a full horn section to back saxman Mike
Belardes, they'd be a dead ringer for the Wynonie Harris band, circa 1949.
Veteran alternative rockers Spot 1019 and the Muskrats work Saturday at the I
Beam. Determined to try something a little different for once, guitarist Rene
Solis of Nitecry gave his band the night off tonight and assembled an all-star
lineup of local blues players to work J.J.'s in San Jose: Gary Smith, Danny
Dinero, Tim Richards and Liz Fisher. Up the road apiece at J.J.'s Mountain
View, rock 'n' blues piano ace Marcia Ball checks in Wednesday. Soul belter
Carla Thomas (daughter of the great Memphis soul man Rufus Thomas, by the way)
lights up Slim's on Saturday.;    Memories department: Chris Esparza, the
floating-party impresario who got his start at the now-defunct One Step Beyond
in Santa Clara, is behind a reunion of former One Step Beyond employees set
for 2 p.m. Sunday at Pedro's in Santa Clara. During the mammoth club's
four-year lifespan, it served as a training ground for dozens of young people
who are now well placed with bands, clubs, radio stations and record
companies. Esparza says all former employees are welcome -- and former owner
Stan Kent is not.; (hbox);    Our own Top 10: Wherein members of the local
music community tell us what songs are getting heavy play in their homes and
cars. This week's list comes from bassist Eddie Sedano and guitarist Greg Camp
of the Worry Dolls.;     1. "Jesse James Bolero," Prefab Sprout;     2. "Smile
On," Dee-Lite;     3. "Madhouse," Mano Negra;     4. "The Love You Save," the

Paris," Les Negresses Verte;    10. "Suicide Walk," the Worry Dolls; (hbox);  
 In clubland tonight: The Pounding Birds roost at the Hotel Utah in San
Francisco. Connie Champagne and her Tiny Bubbles wax effervescent at the
Paradise Lounge in San Francisco.  </TEXT>
