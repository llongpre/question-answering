   Yo, James Brown! You may be sitting in jail,
but your soul's on the loose in all kinds of songs, thanks to rap's
booming use of a musical borrowing technique called sampling.
   Mixing a hunger for instant recognition with a disregard for
copyright law, rappers are exploiting sophisticated electronics to
lift drum beats, guitar riffs and vocal phrases from old songs and
plunk them into their new works.
   Through digital sampling, for example, rapper L.L. Cool J
dresses up a song with Chuck Berry's guitar licks.
   Both sampling and rap are so popular that lawyers are loading up
their litigation bags to handle the potential barrage of copyright
lawsuits. At the heart of the debate is whether rap is a legally
protected, hip-hopping art form or just high-tech cattle rustling.
   ``I don't see any protection for (sampling) anywhere, ever,''
said Peter Paterno, a music industry attorney whose clients include
Guns N' Roses. ``I think every one of these guys who samples is
going to lose (in court).''
   Ricky Grundy, co-president and owner of Graffiti Talk Music,
says there should be compensation for sampling. ``The (rappers) are
not being creative. They're using other talent to make up an
idea,'' he said.
   Indeed, Frank Zappa now puts this warning on his rock albums:
``Unauthorized reproduction-sampling is a violation of applicable
laws and subject to criminal prosecution.''
   Yet rappers and their supporters insist that this pop-culture
pastiche represents rap's essence. Without sampling, they insist,
there wouldn't be any raps worth rapping.
   ``That's a part of rap _ sampling,'' said Tone Loc, whose ``Wild
Thing'' includes bits from Van Halen's ``Jamie's Crying,'' and
whose ``Funky Cold Medina'' appropriates parts of Foreigner's ``Hot
Blooded.''
   ``You bring back old songs that you might have forgot about or
never heard before. When you hear the little riff, that little tune
in your head, it starts coming back to you, and it sounds good,''
said Loc, one of the few rappers who seeks permission for most of
his musical raids. ``We don't have live musicians to play for us. I
never had a live drummer.''
   Today's digital technology reduces even the most complicated,
multi-layered songs to individual data bits. Thus, a single
tambourine hit from a '40s classic that has been digitally
rerecorded can be electronically extracted with surgical precision.
It can then be stored in a computer for use with other music
without missing a beat.
   Discovering musical samples in current rap songs, therefore, can
be a bit like Easter-egg hunts: some can't be missed; others
require a painstaking search.
   De La Soul's ``Eye Know'' borrows from Steely Dan's ``Peg'' and
Otis Redding's ``(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay.'' G-Love-E's
``Suck on This'' contains a sequence from Three Dog Night's ``Mama
Told Me (Not to Come).'' Several years ago, the English band
Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ``Relax'' repeatedly reused a
two-second drum sequence from a 1969 Led Zeppelin album.
   But the biggest source of this digital dredging is James Brown,
now serving a six-year sentence in South Carolina for aggravated
assault and failing to stop for police.
   Brown's work has been replayed by the Fat Boys, Ice-T, Public
Enemy and a host of other rappers. ``The music out there is only as
good as my last record,'' Brown joked in a recent interview from
jail with Rolling Stone magazine.
   While an increasing number of rappers are following Tone Loc's
lead by obtaining rights and paying fees of several hundred dollars
for each sample, many do not. The Beastie Boys, for one, are facing
a copyright infringement suit over their song ``Hold It Now, Hit
It.'' The case could be the first to establish a legal precedent
for future sampling disputes.
   It is alleged that the Beastie Boys _ who sample the ``Psycho''
film score on their upcoming album _ lifted the words ``Yo Leroy''
and some drum beats from Jimmy Castor's 1977 single, ``The Return
of Leroy (Part One).''
   Chuck Ortner, a lawyer representing Beastie Boys label Def Jam
Recordings, said that even if the rappers did sample from Castor,
which he disputes, the band is protected in part by the Fair Use
doctrine of the 1976 Copyright Act, the same doctrine that allows a
college professor to photocopy a short article for a class.
   ``People who create rap music ...(are) basically using tapes and
discs and records as musical instruments themselves,'' Ortner said.
``And ... they should be as free to do that as if they were
actually playing a conventional instrument. If there is a blanket
rule prohibiting this kind of activity, then it will seriously
impede the development of this kind of music.''
   Yet when one of Ortner's own clients was sampled by the group
Blue Mercedes not long ago, he didn't hesitate to bring action
against MCA Records, resulting in a favorable settlement for
Ortner's client, the band M-A-R-R-S. The difference between that
case and the Beastie Boys', he said, is that Blue Mercedes' sample
was far too lengthy to let pass.
   But the logical extension of Ortner's Fair Use defense, said
Paul Goldstein, a professor of copyright law at Stanford Law
School, is that a filmmaker could make a movie out of a popular
book such as ``Gone With the Wind'' without paying royalties.
   So how will the dispute be resolved? Ortner and some lawyers
suggest a sliding fee scale in which rappers would pay a few cents
(or less) on the sale of each record featuring sampling.
   ``The sampling and the use of somebody's prior material ... is
something I have no objection to,'' said Jay Morgenstern, executive
vice president and general manager of music publishing giant
Warner-Chappell Music. ``But if you're going to use somebody else's
material, you should pay them a fair amount for it.
   ``All I have requested of the people who do it is be honest and
fair: Tell us before you do it. We'll make an arrangement with you
whereby a royalty will be paid and due credit will be given.''
   Beyond its financial and legal impact, sampling also might be
impeding the skills of a new generation of musicians.
   ``I have a nephew. I tried to teach him guitar. And he said,
`Later for that,''' said Rick Skatore, a bassist with the New York
band 24-7 Spyz. ``He likes the beat box, that little Casio thing
where you press a button and it plays the beat.
   ``And I ran across another young kid _ his father has been a
guitar player all his life _ and the kid said, `I don't like
playing music, having to learn it. I'd rather sample it. I like
instant gratification.' And I said, `Wow.'''
