   Denny Laine has traveled a long and
stymied road from Scotland's Mull of Kintyre to Lock No. 11 on the
Erie Canal.
   His nine-year odyssey into obscurity since leaving Paul
McCartney's post-Beatles band, Wings, reached a new low when his
boat ran out of gas on the canal last November, and fuel was
nowhere to be found.
   After an aborted boat trip to Florida, Laine and a friend found
themselves stranded in Amsterdam, 30 miles west of Albany. They
eventually found fuel, but the experience gave Laine a few moments
to wonder if the New World offered anything better than the old to
revive his career.
   ``I've always wanted to come here to work,'' said Laine, who
left England last fall to live in another friend's canal-side
mansion in Lockport, 25 miles north of Buffalo. ``I felt this was
where I needed to be to get started. I'm in a begin-again
situation. ... Over here I've got a nostalgia name and people will
probably turn out to see what I can do.''
   After Wings scored with Britain's biggest selling single ever,
``Mull of Kintyre,'' Laine's downward spiral began when he and
McCartney parted company. Critics characterized their split as a
minor version of the McCartney-John Lennon rift that broke up the
Beatles.
   ``There's no real animosity, anymore. ... Me and Paul had a good
team and we still are a good team,'' said Laine, founder of the
Moody Blues and the only member of the original Wings trio whose
last name wasn't McCartney. ``When Lennon died, Paul said he was
never going to let that happen again, he was never going to fall
out with anyone again.''
   In England, Laine left behind a messy divorce, an ugly tax
record and the remnants of a career that always kept him on the
fringes of superstardom.
   At 45, he is struggling to escape the shadow of the aging rock
star with little left to say. He's thought of doing an
autobiography, but he's not sure it would be popular. ``Who am I,
really?'' Laine said.
   With the Moody Blues in the 1960s, Laine was as much a star as
Eric Clapton with Cream or Steve Winwood with Traffic. But his solo
efforts in the '70s and '80s never lifted him above his early work
with the Moodys or his backseat efforts for Wings.
   Such Laine tunes as ``Time to Hide'' did offer a harder-rocking
edge to McCartney's pure pop formula, which produced an assembly
line of hits that included ``My Love'' and ``Let 'Em In.''
   Since leaving Wings in 1981, Laine has put out four obscure solo
albums. As a wandering ex-minstrel, he spent much of his time in
Spain. He learned to travel light, partly by choice and partly
because divorce and taxes claimed so many of his possessions.
   ``I don't really own anything,'' Laine said. ``It makes me more
fluent _ er, fluid. More fluent, too, because I've learned a lot of
languages by traveling around.''
   Laine plans to travel the United States, playing small clubs and
writing material for a new album.
   His first project will be a song called ``Food for All,'' a ``We
Are the World''-style collaboration to raise money for the
homeless. He said he wants to get all his friends from the early
days involved, including McCartney, Clapton and Ron Wood of the
Rolling Stones.
   Laine wrote the music, while his friend Geoffrey Giuliano of
Lockport _ who has written three books on the Beatles _ wrote the
lyrics. Laine, who is now staying with friends in Boston, lived
with Giuliano for about two months last fall.
   Giuliano said Laine's one real talent is ``to make good music.''
But wrong choices have marked his career, and Laine tended to get
suckered into bad business schemes, Giuliano said. Laine admits he
put money where he shouldn't have _ backing a race car driver and a
record shop when he should have been concentrating on his music.
   He has been on his own since breaking with McCartney, although
he did play on McCartney's 1982 album, ``Tug of War.'' After 10
years with Wings, he was tired of being the band's lead guitar but
second fiddle _ or perhaps third fiddle, behind McCartney and his
wife, Linda.
   ``I know people who were a hell of a lot more bitter than I
was,'' Laine said. ``I wasn't bitter so much as sick of it all.
I've retreated to what I was originally, which is an individual
songwriter.''
   The driving force on the Moody Blues' first two albums, Laine
had trouble being the nameless face alongside the McCartneys on
Wings album covers.
   He insists he and McCartney had a true partnership. Yet others
associated with Wings made him feel like McCartney's flunky, a
junior partner on the order of George Harrison, whom McCartney and
Lennon granted a token pair of songs on most Beatles albums, Laine
said.
   ``Other people made me feel like I was working for him instead
of working with him,'' Laine said. ``That was one of the reasons I
did walk away from it.''
   Another reason was McCartney's 1980 marijuana arrest in Japan.
That and death threats McCartney received after Lennon was killed
kept the band from touring.
   ``We would have been going back into the studio for two more
years,'' Laine said. ``I was bored with it.''
   Laine also said he had wanted Wings to turn ``toward more funky,
dancey stuff.'' Since Laine left, McCartney has done just that,
recording with Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Elvis Costello.
   Similarly, Laine said he left the Moody Blues in 1967 because
the other band members seemed unwilling to hit the studio and
record the splashy concept album he wanted to do.
   A few months later, Laine was with Lennon when the Moodys
brought over a tape of their new album. ``Days of Future Passed''
was the band's biggest success, a rock-classical fusion that
yielded ``Nights in White Satin'' and ``Tuesday Afternoon.''
   ``As a result of my leaving, they did exactly what I wanted to
do,'' Laine said. ``But they wouldn't have done it if I had stayed.
I contributed my part and moved on.''
   His anthem could be the early hit he sang for the Moody Blues,
``Go Now.'' When real stardom neared, Laine went.
   ``Maybe I was scared of it or something,'' he said. ``If it
doesn't feel right, I don't stay around very long.''
   Laine plans to marry his long-time girlfriend Helen Grant,
daughter of Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant. They'll stay in the
United States for a year or two so Laine can tour and record,
eventually dividing their time between the United States and
England, he said.
   ``It's my turn to put something together. I can't wait around
any longer for someone to approach me,'' Laine said. ``I feel like
I've been saving myself up for the last few years.''
