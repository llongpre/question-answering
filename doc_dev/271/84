   It's only rock 'n' roll, but she plays it on a
harp.
   ``I hate to play classical,'' says Amy Lee, who entertains lunch
crowds at The Art Institute of Chicago with hits by the likes of
Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. ``But when people
request it, I get out my bag of Bach and my music stand and sit
there, pluck, pluck, plucking.''
   Lee, 34, got tired of black-tie formals, Bach and lounge-lizard
pop tunes like ``Feelings'' when she got hooked on rock as a
teen-ager.
   She has worked as a disc jockey and symphony musician, but her
solo career took off after she performed rock 'n' roll during a
1981 jazz festival in Chicago. She was dubbed ``The Angel of Rock.''
   ``I remember I got a standing ovation for playing `Stairway to
Heaven,' '' she said.
   Lee looks the part of a rock angel. Decked out in bright colors,
a short skirt, bold earrings and dark sunglasses, she taps her feet
and sways as her fingers speed across the 6-foot, 47-string antique
harp her father gave her when she was 7.
   ``The kind of music she makes should be paid attention to,''
said Alek Jakich, an inspector for the city of Chicago and a
regular at the Art Institute's outdoor restaurant, where Lee has
worked the last eight summers.
   ``When was the last time your heard Pink Floyd on the harp?''
Jakich asked. ``And it's great.''
   Playing rock is a switch from when Lee performed with the
Northwest Indiana Symphony and the Twin City Symphony of St.
Joseph, Mich. Being alone on stage is also a switch.
   ``I'm usually background music,'' the 5-foot-5 blonde said at a
performance Tuesday. ``So I decided, `Why not play something I
like?' ''
   That day, her songs by the Eurythmics, the Kinks and The Police
got her a complimentary glass of wine from two women having lunch,
praise from a mother visiting the gallery with her toddler, and
applause after nearly every song.
   Waiters came up to whisper several requests during her
performance in the outdoor atrium scattered with white tables and
matching parasols.
   ``Once they hear the rock songs, then they want to request
them,'' said Lee, who also performs in lounges and has her own jazz
group. ``I've gotten requests for Tom Petty and the Grateful Dead.
But I also get requests for `Lady of Spain.' ''
