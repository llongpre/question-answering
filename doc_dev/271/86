Heather Warnick stood on the small stage at the Calabasas Inn, under a metal 
chandelier shaped like an exotic plant. A band composed of four tuxedoed 
musicians, poised to play guitar, bass, keyboards and drums, stood behind her. 
</P>
<P>
As a little girl, Warnick dreamed of being a singer with a band much like this 
one. She wanted to dress up and perform before crowds, singing pop music. 
</P>
<P>
She has gotten her wish. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen! I've just received word that our bride and groom have 
arrived at the Calabasas Inn!" she announced into a hand-held microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Warnick is the leader of one of the San Fernando Valley's most successful 
wedding bands. 
</P>
<P>
"I want everyone in the room to start cheering for them as loudly as they can," 
she told the crowd of about 100 as the big moment neared. The crowd began to 
applaud politely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couple's Entrance 
</P>
<P>
"They can't hear you!" Warnick scolded, and the crowd got livelier. Then, as 
the just-married couple shyly stuck their heads through the door, Warnick 
joyfully announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, may I present, for the very first 
time, our bride and groom: Karen and Kurt Linden! All right!" 
</P>
<P>
Just as Warnick had instructed them to do, the newlyweds entered and made their 
way to the dance floor, stopping several times to greet friends and relatives. 
The band, known as the Music Connection, broke into "I Had the Time of My Life" 
from the movie "Dirty Dancing," and Warnick began singing. 
</P>
<P>
There was almost an audible sigh from the crowd as the couple began their first 
dance as husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its ability to manufacture moments like these, the Music Connection 
is in high demand, playing up to four events a weekend. A pride in what they do 
and their success soothes whatever resentment might be generated by not playing 
more glamorous events. 
</P>
<P>
Like actors who end up on soap operas, poets who do greeting cards or baseball 
players who never go beyond Triple-A, the musicians in wedding bands have not 
achieved their dreams. But they are, nonetheless, often skilled performers who 
derive great satisfaction from their achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a professional, and I am proud of what I do," said David Gallagher, leader 
of Sunswept, another popular wedding band based in the Valley. "That's more 
than a lot of people in music can say." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher, 33, had so many rock 'n' roll bands when he was a teen-ager in 
Buffalo, N.Y., that he can't remember the name of his first. 
</P>
<P>
"We were Shining Star for a while, Crystal Blue, the Loners -- it changed all 
the time," he said, sitting in the living room of his home in Van Nuys, where 
he meets prospective customers. "But we were always playing a mixture of the 
Stones and Led Zeppelin and the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher and his various bands played school dances until he and the other 
musicians turned 16, when they switched to nightclubs and bars. He played his 
first wedding when he was 18. "I think we got $50," Gallagher, a drummer, said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Gallagher developed an interest in jazz, which worked well 
for weddings. "Back in the 1960s and into the '70s, weddings meant doing jazz 
standards almost all night. Lots of 'Misty,' 'Satin Doll,' 'In the Mood' and 
'Girl From Ipanema.' We might do a twist number or something like 'Proud Mary' 
for the one big rock 'n' roll number for the night." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher moved to Los Angeles in 1982 in hopes of finding steady work as a 
studio musician. To avoid "doing the waiter" bit while he was working toward 
his dream, he put together a band to play at weddings, Christmas parties, bar 
mitzvahs, corporate events and all the other occasions that musicians call 
"casuals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Pay 
</P>
<P>
The casuals eventually came to take up more and more of his time. "I think what 
happened to me is that I turned 30," Gallagher said. "I suddenly wanted a 
steady paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Sunswept plays two to four weddings or other casuals on most weekends and 
charges about $1,000 per event. To supplement his income, Gallagher acts as an 
agent for several other wedding bands. When prospective clients come to his 
house, he can show them videos of Sunswept and a variety of ensembles ranging 
from classical to mariachi. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gallagher, George Banfalvi started his career playing dances. He started 
the Music Connection in 1976 while he was a student at Birmingham High School 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
A year after the band formed, it won second place at a citywide "Battle of the 
Bands" at the Hollywood Bowl. After that came a few club dates, some parties 
and, finally, weddings. Three years later, when the Music Connection was 
playing more and more casuals, Banfalvi went looking for a female singer to 
join the all-male ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a lot more versatility for the kinds of occasions we were 
playing," said Banfalvi, 30, who plays bass. His Northridge home is the 
headquarters for the group, which rehearses there once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"With a female singer, you can do love duets. It's definitely a better 
marketing aspect for a band." 
</P>
<P>
Warnick, who had worked free-lance with several bands as a singer, was ready to 
settle down with one steadily working group. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the illusions of grandeur that every young singer has -- cut a record, 
Vegas," she said. "Maybe I didn't get to do that, but I have a family and I 
wanted a 
</P>
<P>
job where I didn't have to go on the road for weeks at a time. I didn't want to 
be out seven nights a week at a club." 
</P>
<P>
She and Banfalvi became partners, and she took over many of the business and 
organizational aspects of the Music Connection. She meets with couples and 
discusses costs, which total about $1,500 for a standard four hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in music, I love what I do, we're good at it, we work hard and we're 
successful," Warnick said. "Who could fight with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Most of the band's bookings are a result of being seen at various functions, 
Warnick said, and the group is already booked for some bar mitzvahs in 1991. 
Band members have not had a free weekend, other than vacations, for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Goals 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the Music Connection said they love their work, although 
they hope to eventually move on to other musical endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Paul Trudeau, 28, has started to get some studio work. Most 
recently, Trudeau, who lives in North Hollywood, played on a series of jingles 
produced for a Japanese radio program. Drummer Michael Cassam, 31, of Calabasas 
would like to work on pop albums, tour with a pop band and eventually become a 
recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
Lead guitarist Wayne Milligan, 36, of Simi Valley also had a violin with him at 
the wedding reception. Before any of the guests came into the room, he warmed 
up by playing a Bach partita. 
</P>
<P>
"Classical music is where I want to be, where I will be in a couple years," he 
said with a broad smile. He has studied violin since he was 21 and hopes to 
join a symphony. "In the meantime, playing with a band like this on weekends 
keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
The Music Connection plays soft rock, contemporary dance music and oldies -- 
the standard repertoire for most wedding bands -- almost exclusively. So does 
Sunswept. "The days of the Big Band, jazz sound for weddings is practically 
over," Gallagher said. "The contemporary wedding band now is actually a rock 
'n' roll band that can do a few standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll has been around so long that almost everyone responds to it," 
Gallagher said. "They love the dance oldies, the Motown. Once we get into 
'Louie, Louie' or 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine,' that's usually it for the 
night. The party is off and running." 
</P>
<P>
"It's our job to make the party," Warnick said. "I like to get them up there 
dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why, shortly after the festivities began at the Calabasas Inn, Warnick 
began to worry about the Linden party. One of her well-practiced techniques is 
to segue immediately from the first dance -- a slow number that traditionally 
ends with almost everyone on the floor -- into a fast number. "While I've got 
them all up there, I like to sneak in something fast to let them know it's 
going to be a fun party." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tough Crowd 
</P>
<P>
As soon as "Time of My Life" ended, Warnick quickly called for a spirited Kool 
and the Gang song, "Celebrate." But most of the guests, even the young couples, 
walked off the dance floor and returned to their seats for polite conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"This sometimes happens at an afternoon party," Warnick said during the band's 
first break. "But I have some tricks I can use." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, please join us in what we call 'Karen and Kurt's Love Circle,' " she 
announced after the salad course. "We need everyone up here in a big circle. 
We'll give you a minute or so to make your way up here." 
</P>
<P>
No one moved. Warnick looked a tiny bit desperate. "Let's do it for Karen and 
Kurt," she said as the band started playing an instrumental version of "That's 
What Friends Are For." 
</P>
<P>
"A big circle," she said with a smile. "Right here." 
</P>
<P>
Still nothing. Warnick grabbed the wireless mike and jumped off the little 
stage, heading for the nearest table. "I'm going to invite this table to be the 
very first ones up to start the love circle! Thank you! I promise it won't 
hurt." No movement, but she quickly moved on to the next table, working the 
room for all it was worth. 
</P>
<P>
After more pleas, a few guests began to move tentatively. Warnick capitalized 
on their movement to get almost everyone started toward the dance floor. She 
asked everyone to hold hands while the bride and groom danced in the middle of 
the circle. 
</P>
<P>
Guests swayed to the music as Warnick sang the song about warmth and 
friendship. Then, as soon as the number was over, the band broke into "La 
Bamba," one of the sure-fire dance songs of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a handful of couples, everyone drifted back to their tables. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say I didn't try," Warnick said with a laugh during the next break. 
"Sometimes the tricks just don't work." 
</P>
<P>
The guests at the Linden reception seemed happy to simply eat and politely 
visit with one another as the band played the rest of its four-hour engagement. 
With the exception of a few preteens and an irrepressible 18-month-old who hit 
the dance floor often, it was a distinctly laid-back wedding party. The Music 
Connection resigned itself to providing background music with "Rocket Man," 
"Lean on Me," "The Wind Beneath My Wings" and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Warnick would rather have had the crowd up and dancing -- the Music 
Connection's reputation was built on generating a lively atmosphere. But she 
recognizes that her first priority is to size up the crowd and give them what 
they want. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the afternoon party, Warnick sang "The Wind Beneath My Wings" 
from the movie "Beaches" for the second time by request. Most guests had left 
by then, although several had stopped on the way out to pick up one of the 
band's cards from a discreet holder on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
As the band began to pack up, the bride approached them. 
</P>
<P>
"You were fantastic," Karen Linden told them, squeezing Warnick's hand. "It was 
just what I wanted. Thank you so much." 
</P>
<P>
As the bride went back to join her husband, Warnick smiled. "Well," she said, 
"maybe it seemed like a slow day to us, but she and her husband seemed happy 
with what we did. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's what matters."
