In a thin week for pop releases, compilations once more dominate the scene.
The most interesting of these is Nothing Less Than Brilliant - The Best of
Sandie Shaw (Virgin), spanning a 30-year career which virtually tells the
story of British pop, from the bouncy innocence of 'There's Always Something
There To Remind Me' to her collaboration with the laconic Morrisey and The
Smiths. Even more obviously aimed for the Christmas market is Fields of Gold
 -The Best Of Sting (A&amp;M), a reasonable enough collection which also
includes two new tracks. Finally, The Best of Youssou N'Dour (Virgin)
contains highlights from the career of one of Africa's best-known musicians
and includes some of his work with Peter Gabriel.
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, the creative force behind Led Zeppelin, put
their talents together again for the first time in 14 years on No Quarter -
Unledded (Fontana). The once-dynamic duo have sought inspiration from Indian
and Moroccan musicians who play on live reworkings of some of the band's
previous material. It is an adventurous album, much more imaginative than
the standard ageing-rock star reunion, which also includes some new songs.
Three of the greatest operas in the repertoire get fresh releases this week.
Followers of late Verdi are particularly well-served: first there is Otello
(Deutsche Grammophon) with Placido Domingo once again interpreting one of
the roles at which he excels and Cheryl Studer as Desdemona; Myung-Whun
Chung conducts the Orchestre et Choeurs de l'Opera Bastille. Then there is a
live recording of Falstaff (Sony), with Juan Pons playing the title role and
Riccardo Muti conducting the Orchestra del Teatro alla Scala. Cheryl Studer
also stars in Deutsche Gramophon's new Lohengrin, with Siegfried Jerusalem
as the eponymous hero and Claudio Abbado conducting the Wiener
Philharmoniker. Abbado and the Berliner Philharmoniker feature in a series
of new live recordings on the Sony label, which include Tchaikovsky's
Symphony No 5, Dvorak's Symphony No 8 and music by Brahms, Strauss, Reger
and Rihm inspired by the poems of Friedrich Holderlin. Most imaginative
collection of the lot is an album dedicated to the myth of Prometheus in
music, featuring interpretations by Beethoven, Liszt, Scriabin and Nono.
