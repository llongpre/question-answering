Robert Plant's show practically burned down the house Friday night at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre, but it also stunk up the joint. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was Plant's fans who did the burning and stinking. Taking a 
familiar arena-rock act of homage to extremes, thousands of them set beer and 
soda cups aflame and held them aloft. Forget flick-your-Bic. This was 
light-your-torch. 
</P>
<P>
In the 22 years since his start with Led Zeppelin, Plant presumably has seen 
just about everything that a rock audience's huddled masses can come up with. 
But this left him agape. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow, look at that," the 41-year-old Englishman said, pausing after "Ship of 
Fools," the ballad that touched off the pyromania. Later, stopping again to 
scan the impressive field of burning cups, he pronounced the sight "beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The melting material from the cups smelled like incinerator spew, no doubt 
highly carcinogenic. For a while, mass asphyxiation seemed a possibility. 
Luckily, the ammo was spent by the start of Plant's second encore. Fun's fun, 
folks, but let's not make this a habit, OK? 
</P>
<P>
Plant's show was full of other memorably strange and wacky occurrences that 
made the evening more than your usual hard rocker's night out. (At one point, 
somebody presented Plant with a lemon, an unsuccessful effort to get him to 
sing a Led Zep oldie, "The Lemon Song," giving the singer occasion to display 
some likable wit.) 
</P>
<P>
Musically, the nearly two-hour show ranged from dull and diffuse during the 
first half to appealingly folkish during a mid-set acoustic segment, to flaming 
-- figuratively speaking -- during a splendid show-closing pair of 
rockabilly-tinged rockers: Zep's "Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)" and 
Plant's solo hit "Tall Cool One." 
</P>
<P>
For one of rock's supposed titans, Plant's presence as a performer was 
surprisingly unremarkable. He was energetic enough, with his characteristic 
spins, struts, cross-legged steps and dramatic, hands-aloft pose-striking 
framed by all manner of stage fog and backlighting. 
</P>
<P>
But visuals alone don't make a singer commanding. The performers who fix our 
attention are the ones with something truly vivid to say. Plant has devoted his 
career to heroic gestures and inflated myth-weaving, but his songs during and 
after Led Zeppelin have seldom packed involving meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his show, Plant's myths and mysteries became shrouded in a musical fog 
of gauzelike keyboard textures and elongated, meandering arrangements. Plant 
found a focus by simplifying things. "Liar's Dance" featured nothing but his 
dramatic vocal and Doug Boyle's spare, tense acoustic guitar. He followed it 
with "Going to California," keeping the accompaniment acoustic while 
introducing a wistful, dreamy tone. 
</P>
<P>
The show gathered force from there, although it was only during the 
hard-charging encores that Plant and his band of capable, versatile, though not 
really distinctive players achieved what the title of his most recent album 
promises: manic nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
Opening singer Alannah Myles displayed a mighty blues-soaked vocal style and a 
frolicsome stage manner brimming with sly, mischievous sexuality. Myles did a 
fine job occupying the middle ground between Bonnie Raitt's rootsy authenticity 
and Pat Benatar's mainstream arena-rock style.
