   The Pump Room, which has served meals to
celebrities from Bogart and Bacall to Belushi, and banned rocker
Phil Collins for inappropriate dress, is turning 50 and the owner
says he wants the tradition to continue.
   ``I want the stories of today to be as legendary as the ones of
40 years ago,'' said Richard Melman, who bought the historic
restaurant in the Omni Ambassador East Hotel a dozen years ago.
   The famous eatery, where Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall
celebrated their wedding, will officially mark its 50th anniversary
Oct. 1.
   The restaurant made its name as a place for show business and
high society people to see and be seen, but it also is a place
where many go to celebrate anniversaries or graduations.
   ``To this day, many people come here for special occasions _
they get very emotional about it,'' Melman said. ``So do I. I don't
feel like the owner as much as the curator of part of Chicago's
history.''
   The Pump Room was founded by Ernie Byfield in 1938 and soon
became known as the place where stars had to go when they stopped
in the Windy City on their train trips to Hollywood.
   Celebrities such as Sammy Davis Jr., Clark Gable, Bette Davis,
Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor, rock group Led Zeppelin and canine beer promoter Spuds
MacKenzie have put their names or paw prints in ``The Great
Signature Book of the Pump Room.''
   A historical booklet put out as part of the anniversary
celebration lists almost 1,000 celebrities who have visited the
Pump Room.
   Customers wearing sneakers and men without jackets are politely
turned away from the restaurant _ sometimes.
   The rule apparently depends on how famous people are. One of the
most prominently displayed photographs in the restaurant shows
actor John Belushi, clad in a T-shirt, having dinner with film
critic Roger Ebert.
   But rock star Phil Collins was turned away because of
inappropriate dress by a maitre d' who did not recognize him, and
that led to the title of the singer's hit album, ``No Jacket
Required.''
