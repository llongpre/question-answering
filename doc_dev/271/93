   An 11-hour party-concert featuring Crosby,
Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Peter Townshend and Mick Jagger will
celebrate the 40th anniversary of Atlantic Records.
   ``It seems like only yesterday we set up shop in the old
Jefferson Hotel on 56th and Broadway,'' said Chairman of the Board
Ahmet Ertegun, who co-founded the company in 1948.
   Among the past and present Atlantic Records performers scheduled
to participate are ex-Who guitarist Townshend and his vocalist
partner Roger Daltrey; Rolling Stones Jagger and Keith Richards;
Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd; drummer Phil Collins as a solo and with
Genesis; and former Led Zeppelin bandmates Robert Plant and Jimmy
Page, according to a company statement.
   ``This label, perhaps more than any other, followed the move
from R'n'B to rock 'n' roll,'' Ken Erlich, who will produce the May
14 show at Madison Square Garden, said Tuesday. ``It's a microcosm
of American music from the past 40 years.''

   Local officials are rolling up the
welcome mat to show their distaste for actress Jane Fonda when the
former anti-war activist comes to this mill town to film a movie
this summer.
   The board of aldermen, backing a local veterans' group, voted
10-3 Tuesday to not welcome Fonda because of her visit to Hanoi
during the Vietnam War.
   ``A traitor is not welcome anywhere in this country,'' said Bud
Gagnon, director of the Chicopee Veterans' Services. ``She went to
Hanoi. She's a traitor. She did it while our POWs were there.''
   The aldermen did not comment on the symbolic gesture at a
meeting attended by a small group of veterans.
   The resolution states that ``Jane Fonda should not receive any
official recognition and-or that courtesy should not be extended to
Jane Fonda prior to or during the filming of the movie `Union
Street.'''
   Stephen Rivers, a spokesman for Fonda, called the vote
``unfortunate but irrelevant.'' He said the board bowed to
complaints from a few veterans, most of whom did not serve in
Vietnam.

   A technical glitch has forced the producers of
the new musical version of Stephen King's ``Carrie'' to postpone
the show's opening by eight days, making it ineligible for the 1988
Tony awards.
   The show, which stars Betty Buckley and 17-year-old Linzi
Hateley in the title role as a teen-age girl with telekinetic
powers, was to open May 4, one day before the Tony nomination
deadline for this season.
   But problems transporting the scenery from London forced the
delay until May 12, spokesman Jim Baldassare said Tuesday.
   The show will be eligible for the awards in 1989. ``Carrie''
begins previews at the Virginia Theater on April 28, two weeks
later than originally scheduled.

   If baseball slugger Don Mattingly
reaches his goal of 240 hits in 1988, he'll not only break his
Yankee record but will raise $24,000 for the mentally retarded.
   For the third straight season, Municipal Bond Investors
Assurance Corp. will donate $100 to the Westchester Association for
Retarded Citizens and the Westchester-Putman Special Olympics every
time Mattingly gets a base hit.
   The recently announced donations will be used to expand
recreational programs by paying the foundation for the first
permanent recreational facility for the mentally retarded in
Westchester County.
   Last year, Mattingly's 186 hits resulted in an $18,600 donation
while his 1986 Yankee hit record of 238 resulted in a $23,800
contribution.
   MBIA Corp. is a financial guarantee company.

   American soprano Barbara Hendricks, an ambassador
of good will for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees,
says the spirit of Vietnamese refugees at a filthy camp inspired
her to sing black spirituals to them.
   ``I discovered the richness of the human spirit,'' she said of
the camp in Malaysia. ``We need to find these people a land of
welcome, where they can live with dignity.''
   Hendricks, appointed to the honorary U.N. post in December, says
she will perform in a UNESCO-sponsored concert here April 20 to
benefit refugees.
   The soprano, who recently starred in the film version of the
Italian opera ``La Boheme,'' will be joined in the televised
concert by conductor Lorin Maazel, Spanish tenor Placido Domingo,
Irish flutist James Galway and others. The concert, Classic Aid II,
will be shown in France and an unspecified number of other
countries.
