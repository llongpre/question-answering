   If you're looking for an unfinished luxury home
with no utilities but such extras as graffiti declaring ``Led
Zeppelin Rules,'' Frank Norris has just the place for you.
   Norris and an army of bureaucrats like him are ready to deal.
They work for the Resolution Trust Corp., an agency created Aug. 9
when President Bush signed legislation bailing out the savings and
loan industry.
   Norris, 55, manages Commonwealth Savings Association, a Houston
thrift institution with $1.6 billion in assets and $600 million in
red ink.
   Along with others working for the RTC, he's trying to sell
thousands of repossessed properties the government is inheriting
from as many as 600 failed thrift institutions.
   The properties range from run-of-the-mill to the exotic; from
apartment buildings, shopping centers and office towers to a
windmill farm, a buffalo sperm bank and the entire town of Lehigh
Acres, Fla., population 25,000.
   No one knows for certain how much it's all worth. The
government's own estimate _ $300 billion to $500 billion _ leaves a
wide margin for error.
   But even at the low end of the range, the RTC, when running at
full capacity, will in effect be the largest financial institution
in the country, twice as large as Citicorp, the nation's biggest
bank.
   Already, lawyers, accountants and real estate specialists are
swarming, hoping to secure contracts as consultants helping
regulators manage and sell the property. Speculators are circling,
hoping to buy cheap.
   A handful of newsletters devoted solely to covering the agency
have sprung up. One, the Resolution Trust Reporter, advertised for
subscribers at $398 a year by asking, ``Who's Going to Cash in When
the Resolution Trust Corp. Opens Its Doors? HOW ABOUT YOU?''
   Consumer watchdogs warn the task is so mammoth and so difficult
that scandal is inevitable, scandal dwarfing the troubles now
plaguing the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Whether or not these dire predictions prove true largely depends
on Norris and other federal agents managing 260 of the most deeply
insolvent S&amp;Ls already under government control in 33 states.
   They are the antithesis of the high-fliers who drove the S&amp;Ls
into the red by making fraudulent loans and spending depositors'
funds on lavish parties and corporate jets.
   On the job, they may sit in paneled executive suites and oversee
hundreds of employees. But on their own time, they drive rented
cars, live out of suitcases and eat in cafeterias for lunch.
   How well they perform likely will be the critical factor in
deciding whether the government successfully completes the S&amp;L
bailout without turning to the taxpayers for more money.
   If the RTC sells the property it is inheriting too fast or too
cheaply, it could ruin real estate values across the oil-producing
regions of the Southwest, further narrowing the taxpayers' chances
of recovering part of their contribution to the bailout, estimated
at $1,000 each.
   If it keeps the property too long, maintenance and other costs
could quickly pile up, offsetting any gain realized by holding out
for a higher price.
   The problem is that much of it is virtually unsellable at any
price. Nevertheless, Norris has banished the word ``problem'' from
his vocabulary, substituting ``opportunity.''
   ``We have plenty of opportunities. Absolutely!'' he says with the
kind of overly cheerful tone used only by a dentist or a man who
dismantles banks for a living.
   Commonwealth's contribution to the real estate mess is about $670
million in repossessed property. While Norris has none of the
out-of-the-ordinary repossessions that grab headlines, what he does
have amply illustrates the ``opportunities'' ahead for the RTC.
Here's a sampling:
   _Two single-family homes in a prosperous northwestern Houston
neighborhood. Tract mansions, they were built on speculation and
repossessed, still unfinished, after the developer couldn't make the
payments on a $794,000 loan.
   In one, swarms of mosquitoes stream through broken windows and
buzz over the glass-strewn floors of what would have been an elegant
living room with a stone fireplace and cathedral ceiling. In the
other, an empty beer can, candle drippings and graffiti _ ``Led
Zeppelin Rules'' _ show that local youths have made a hangout of
what would have been a luxury kitchen encircled by maple-stained
cabinets. At most, the homes are now worth $100,000 each.
   _A shopping strip not far from Houston's posh Galleria mall. Cars
cluster in one end of the parking lot around an eight-theater
cinema. At the other end, diners stroll from a cafeteria. Between
the two stand empty stores, a long expanse of concrete and blank
glass. The strip is probably worth less than half of Commonwealth's
$15 million loan.
   _A vacant lot, just off Houston's busy Southwest Freeway. A
developer borrowed $14 million, hoping to build an office tower on
the spot, but the deal fell through.
   All three properties are far from ready for sale. The would-be
luxury homes, for instance, have deteriorated so sharply that it
could cost more to make them habitable and attractive than it would
to buy similar homes in good shape.
   The shopping center encroaches on an adjoining property, and the
government will have to pay lawyers to clear up the title problem
before sale.
   Parcels have been carved from the vacant lot for a gas station
and a drive-in bank, leaving an irregularly shaped piece of land
scarcely suitable for an office building, even if there were demand
for more office space in Houston, which there is not.
   Multiply Commonwealth's problems 30-fold to get an idea of the
magnitude of the S&amp;L mess in Houston. Multiply Commonwealth 700-fold
to get an appreciation of the problem nationally.
