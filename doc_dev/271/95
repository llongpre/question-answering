<TEXT>     Firm makes up difference;  The money will be added to $155,636.66 now in
the "Gift of Life for Shannon M. Brace" fund. Cirrus Logic Inc., a Fremont
manufacturer of semiconductors where Shannon's mother, Laurie, works, will
make up whatever is needed to reach the $205,000 required for Shannon's bone
marrow transplant.;    Paul Rodgers and Kenney Jones, both members of the Law
band, played auctioneer Sunday when autographed guitars and albums went on the
block. The most coveted items, the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band gold
album by the Beatles, and a guitar autographed by Tom Petty, brought $1,800
and $1,600, respectively.;    Also auctioned were guitars autographed by
AC/DC, the Black Crowes, George Thorogood and Bay Area star Chris Isaak.
Albums by the Rolling Stones, the Who, Led Zeppelin and the late Stevie Ray
Vaughan also were sold.;    Meanwhile, Shannon is recovering well from her
operation at Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.;    'Going
positively';  "I've almost got my old Shannon back. She's been out of
isolation since Monday and is playing. The doctors say things are going
positively now," Laurie Brace said Tuesday.;    Shannon had been expected to
spend four to six weeks in isolation following her June 7 operation.;   
Cheryl Oliver, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said that Shannon's white and
red blood cell counts are up and that doctors plan to take her off
antibiotics.;    "She's beginning to be perky Shannon again," Oliver said.;   
Shannon entered the hospital on May 29 for a week of chemotherapy to kill the
rare germ cell tumor cancer, which was first diagnosed when she was 2 years
old. Three weeks earlier, doctors had removed marrow to prevent it from being
killed by the chemotherapy. On June 7, doctors re-injected the marrow to fight
off the toxic effects of the chemotherapy.;    Doctors said the child had
little chance of living without the transplant.;    The drive to aid Shannon's
family drew widespread attention and support, especially on April 14 when she
sat on the lap of Barbara Bush during the first lady's visit to the children's
hospital. When donations started to drop off early this month, Cirrus Logic,
which had opened the campaign with $20,000, announced it would match all
donations until the $205,000 goal was reached.;    The Braces' insurance
company won't pay for the operation because it's considered experimental.  </TEXT>
