   The latest revival of Dixieland jazz, which has
become all but an epidemic in California for obscure reasons, is a
return to New Orleansian basics with aficionados rummaging through
musty attics, piano neches and antique shops in search of obscure
sheet music. Take a listen as Anna and Fred Wahler bring together
several semipro bands and hundreds of fans for their Spring Fling.

   Outside, it's raining in sheets, but
Anna Wahler could care less. She and husband Fred are hosting a
Spring Fling. Let the good times roll.
   Or, according to the jazz rondos of the four bands they have
invited to the Fling, ``The World Is Waiting for The Sunrise'' or
``Shine Away Your Bluesies'' and, befitting proper guests, ``Carry
Me Back to Old Virginny.''
   Fred, 73, is retired from the post office, Anna as paymistress
for the White House, which is irrelevant here. What is not is that
Anna has picked up more splinters from benches listening to antique
musicians at Preservation Hall in New Orleans ``than I would care
to count.''
   Anna and Fred are jazz buffs. So are the 450 weekend attendees
at their Fling at the Hilton Hotel here. And so are the musicians
who are making $200, more for love than money. And so are God knows
how many more bands and fans _mostly white and middle class _
throughout this land who couldn't make it.
   We are not talking about guys in straw hats who oompah ``When
The Saints Go Marchin' In'' at political clambakes. That has been
scornfully dismissed as Disneyland jazz.
   Dixieland, for want of a more precise term, has had more
revivals than Lazarus. This current one, all but an epidemic in
California for reasons various ologists can't seem to define, is a
return to New Orleansian basics. The bands and their claques have
backpedaled down the 'Sippi like riverboats in reverse, upturned
musty attics, mined abandoned piano niches and antique shops for
ancient, obscure anthems as if Charlie Mingus and Led Zeppelin had
never been born.
   ``They're good tunes. You wonder why they're obscure,'' wondered
John Wood, a tuba player. There is a bit of one-upmanship in
finding the least-known golden deadie, airs even most fans don't
know.
   The musicians are almost to a man men. They are long-ago
graduates of high school bands who remember Dad's old 78s played on
windup Victrolas. They are full-time lawyers, Indians (e.g.,
Charlie Castro of the High Sierra Jazz Band present at the Fling)
and merchant chiefs. They are weekend minstrels because they want
to be, not have to be. Listen! Some are playing right now.
   Stan Vincent, the 53-year-old adman trombonist of The New Black
Eagle Jazz Band that is revered by Boston buffs next only to the
sacred cod, has planted his feet firmly, set to go to work on
``Seattle Hunch.'' To his right, Eli Newberger, a noted
pediatrician, hugs his pre-World War I weapon in his lap like a
mistress.
   He inhales deeply, then begins mouth-to-mouth resuscitation into
the mouthpiece like a Laocoon wrestling with the intestinal steam
plant that is his tuba. It reverberates with Jovian judgment, then
murmurs falsetto, light as baby breath.
   Tony Pringle, who once got top billing when he was young in
Liverpool _ ahead of a rock group called The Quarrymen before they
changed their name to The Beatles _ leads the band with a cornet
whose ancestor was one he sent away for the minute he heard his
first Jelly Roll Morton record. His barking horn snaps at the best
notes, omitting the lesser for his confreres to chew. Pumping
behind them is a rhythm section of a dental professor whose
curriculum vitae runs 23 pages, an architect and a psychologist.
They begin exhuming ``Leaning on Your Gate.''
   The Black Eagles are succeeded by the host ensemble, The Buck
Creek Jazz Band. (Fred and Anna live on Buck Creek.) Their leader,
another architect named Jim Ritter, assumes a rifleman's stance,
draws a bead on the notes inside his cornet, then fires them in
staccato bursts into the audience. Beside him John Skillman, a
Pentagon engineer, writhes at his arpeggios like someone trying to
squirm out of a girdle while playing clarinet at the same time. The
outcome is commanding. This unearthed chorale is ``Shaking the
Blues Away,'' something whose mummified sheet music they had seen
and practiced only that morning.
   On to ``His Eye Is on The Sparrow,'' a hymn of reverence
featuring co-leader Jim Mesich, an environmental consultant, on his
euphonium, a higher-pitched cousin of Newberger's plumbing. Mesich
once ad-libbed the vocal in lamenting verses for a deceased
grandchild. His wife had to leave the room. Jazz is communication
of soul. Newberger once reduced a pub full of Scots to tears
whispering his tuba to ``Heather on the Hill.''
   ``People who said Dixieland is dead don't have that pulse in
their hearts,'' says Skillman.
   When Buck Creek played for its 10th birthday here two years ago,
80 percent of the audience was from California. Out there, there is
scarcely a freeway caravansary, a suburban converted prunery or a
gentrified Sierra mining camp that doesn't have its resident jazz
band. Custer's Last Band. Natural Gas. Sutterville Stompers. The
Nightblooming Jazzmen.
   There's a circuit of jazz festivals in California. Sacramento's
in May is the biggest with 120 traditional jazz bands from all over
the world, including this year the Peace Hotel Old Jazz Band from,
yes, Shanghai. The faithful trail along after them in their RVs
like kids tagging along at a New Orleans brass band funeral,
collecting souvenir admission buttons as they go.
   The musicians reciprocate. A trombone case at Anna's Fling bears
stickers from Sydney, Auckland, San Diego, Davenport, Iowa (home of
the beatified Bix Beiderbecke), Edinburgh, Eindhoven in the
Netherlands, Munich in Germany.
   ``Trad'' jazz bands play their oldies on cruise ships, at
college concerts, in gin mills, auto body shop grand openings,
even, in the case of the Black Eagles, at the installation of an
Episcopalian bishop in Boston. The Catholics graciously lent their
cathedral for the ceremony because it was bigger. The Eagles, just
as graciously and ecumenically jazzed ``Together'' from their
500-tune repertory.
   Money is rarely a motive for the trad musician. Oh, Newberger,
who once flew from Africa to Denver for a gig, says he took in
$16,000 last year tubaing. If a Black Eagle made all 120 or so of
the band's gigs in a year, his kitty might be $24,000. But Betty
Ritter says her husband and his playmates possibly clear $4,000
each.
