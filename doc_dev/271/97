   A federal grand jury has indicted two music
promoters, a former radio executive and the wife of one promoter on
charges of tax evasion and paying more than $270,000 in cash plus
cocaine to get records played on the air.
   Employees of nine radio stations in eight cities were named as
receiving the payola between 1980 and 1986, but weren't indicted.
Some were cooperating with authorities, the government said.
   Two of the stations are in Fresno, Calif.; and one each in El
Paso, Texas; Kansas City, Mo.; Atlanta; Cincinnati; Jacksonville,
Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Charlotte, N.C.
   The investigation is continuing, but U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner
declined to say if more indictments were expected.
   The three indictments announced Friday stem from an
investigation that began two years ago.
   ``The independent promoters were acting on behalf of virtually
all record companies in this country,'' Bonner said. But he said
there was no evidence that the record companies were aware of the
payola.
   Among those indicted Friday was independent promoter Ralph
Tashjian, an associate of Joseph Isgro, a Los Angeles-based
promoter who also has been under investigation but wasn't named in
the indictments.
   Tashjian, 39, of San Mateo, Calif., was accused of giving cash,
cocaine and ``other valuable considerations'' to radio station
employees. Among the records he pushed were Duran Duran's ``Wild
Boys'' and former Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant's
``Principle Of.''
   Tashjian also was accused of obstructing justice by falsifying
records of his company, Ralph Tashjian Enterprises Inc., after
learning he was under investigation.
   Tashjian and his wife, Valerie, were accused of under-reporting
income by $303,988 for 1983, 1984 and 1985, to evade $101,579 in
federal taxes.
   David Kenner, attorney for the Tashjians, who were arrested at
their home Thursday, said the couple ``categorically denies any
wrongdoing.''
   In a second indictment, independent promoter William Craig, 42,
of Scottsdale, Ariz., also known as William Craighead, was accused
of making illegal payments to get records on the air, willfully
aiding in the preparation of fraudulent federal tax returns and
attempting to evade individual income tax.
   Craig promoted records by Janet Jackson, Culture Club, New
Edition and the Eurythmics, among others.
   A woman who answered one of Craig's telephone numbers took a
message but said it was doubtful the call would be returned.
   A third indictment accused George Wilson Crowell, also known as
George Wilson, 59, former vice president and general manager of
radio station KIQQ in Los Angeles, with willful failure to file
federal income tax returns for 1984, 1985 and 1986.
   Crowell's attorney, Sidney Sodas of Milwaukee, Wis., had no
comment on the indictment.
   Crowell of Denver and Craig are expected to surrender within the
next few days, Bonner said.
   Maximum penalties for those indicted are: Craig, 18 years in
prison, fines of $1.64 million; Tashjian, 23 years, $1.53 million;
Mrs. Tashjian, 15 years, $1.5 million; and Crowell, three years,
$75,000, Bonner said.
