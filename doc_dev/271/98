   To the beat of heavy-metal rock music, two
teen-agers carved tombstones out of plastic foam, then shot
themselves to death in an apparent suicide pact, authorities said.
   The bodies of Phillip Gomiser and David Olive, both 15, were
found Wednesday night in a trash-filled field just west of here by
Gomiser's father, Phillip Sr., a spokesman for the Palm Beach County
sheriff's office said.
   Both teen-agers apparently died of self-inflicted shotgun wounds
to the head several days earlier, spokesman Bob Ferrell said
Thursday. They disappeared from their Lake Worth homes about a week
ago, taking along a shotgun from Olive's home.
   Their partially decomposed bodies were found lying beside plastic
foam tombstones etched with their initials and the letters
``R.I.P.,'' for ``Rest In Peace,'' Ferrell said.
   ``At this point, we're assuming that each one shot himself,''
Ferrell said. ``There was only one shotgun found. The sequence of
events may be something we can never determine.''
   Authorities, friends and family spoke of various things that
might have triggered the suicides: a divorce, the suicide death of a
classmate, heavy-metal music.
   Jim Cappello, a classmate of Olive's at Santaluces High School,
said the boys had talked openly of ending their lives since another
student at the high school committed suicide several months ago.
   Olive's mother, Eline, said said she had tried to find
psychiatric care for her son at various private and public agencies
but all had waiting lists.
   ``I felt he had serious problems, and I was doing the best I
could to get him some help,'' she said.
   ``He was depressed over family situations, a recent divorce and
separation,'' Mrs. Olive said. ``My son had ... over the past two
months not cared whether he lived or died.''
   Ferrell said a tape recorder with a Led Zeppelin tape that had
played itself out was found near the bodies.
   ``It appears at this time it was tied to heavy metal,'' Ferrell
said.
   But one friend said he did not believe that the music contributed
to their suicides.
   ``I listen to that same music,'' said Steven Swann, a
10th-grader. ``We just like the music, we didn't pay that much
attention to what it meant.''
