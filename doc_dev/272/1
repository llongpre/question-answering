With the comment 'Only people who look dull ever go into the House of
Commons, and only the dull ever succeed there.' Oscar Wilde was not writing
political commentary 1992 style but comedy 1895 style.
The week Lady Thatcher took her seat in the Lords, Wilde's An Ideal Husband
at The Royal Exchange, Manchester, claimed that joining the Upper House
signalled that one has ended one's political ambitions.
James Maxwell's fine production touches the wit and the wisdom in Wilde. An
Ideal Husband has the usual Wilde serve-and-volley wit with sporadic passing
shots. The epigrams are delivered with point, and the deeper rhythms of this
highly moral play emerge clearly.
An Ideal Husband balances public virtue and private vice. Politics means
realpolitik: 'Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own
weapons, and what this century regards is wealth.'
Sir Robert Chiltern, the Dorian Gray of the financial markets, has based his
spotless political career on trading information for money in Suez Canal
shares.
Twenty years on, a blackmailer (Mrs Cheveley) threatens to expose him unless
he trades his influence for his reputation by manipulating a Commons
Commission on Argentinian waterways.
Chiltern, the ideal husband, stands to lose his wife's respect: by
dishonestly fixing the Commission, or by having his duplicitous past
revealed.
The acting, particularly from Robert Glenister (Lord Goring, 'the idlest man
in London') as Chiltern's worldly and dandyish friend, draws on the moral
scope in Wilde's text. Chiltern and his wife (Tom Chadbon and Emily Morgan)
resist the machinations of Brenda Blethyn's Mrs Cheveley and emerge with
moral as well as social dignity; but they uncover the woe that is in
marriage.
As Lord Goring's father says: 'Dammit, Sir, it's your duty to get married,
you can't always be living for pleasure.'
Wilde's advice is to marry a tolerant partner. For he knew that life can be
neither understood nor lived without charity. This serious play lightly
figured, delivers a fine lesson showing how truth is rarely pure and never
simple.
