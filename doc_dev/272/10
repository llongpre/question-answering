   Watching the frumpy, middle-aged wife of a
provincial English vicar spiral out of control may not seem to be
the ideal subject for what appears, at first, to be a domestic
comedy.
   But Alan Ayckbourn's ``Woman in Mind,'' which opened Wednesday
at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club, is a very funny play. It
is also a dark, disturbing one, an unsettling look at someone
slowly going mad.
   What makes ``Woman in Mind'' special is its fractured,
odd-angled look at the play's main character, a dispirited, dowdy
housewife named Susan. The woman is defeated by life and trapped in
a marriage where she is not so much unloved as ignored.
   The play could have been a dismal household harangue, but
Ayckbourn makes it decidedly unconventional. He carries
theatergoers into Susan's psyche, and it's a harrowing journey.
   A blow to the head from a garden rake sets Susan off on an
escape into fantasy. What Ayckbourn does is juggle reality and
illusion in front of us, while posing questions about happiness,
love and faith and what happens to a woman who has very little of
each in her life.
   Susan's fantasies come alive in the form of a make-believe
family, a husband, brother and daughter who look and sound like
they just stepped out of a Noel Coward comedy. Drinking champagne
and perpetually dressed for tennis, the trio offers her relief from
her unrelenting and uncaring world.
   These people are the antitheses of Susan's real-life husband and
assorted relatives and friends. The stuffy, smug husband is more
concerned about finishing a 600-year history of the local parish
than with his wife's mental collapse.
   The woman must also endure a comic gorgon of a sister-in-law
whose ineptness as a cook sends guests fleeing in terror; a
well-meaning but accident-prone doctor who develops a crush on her,
and an unforgiving son who returns home from the clutches of a
bizarre sect where silence was not only golden but absolute.
   Susan sorts out life in her garden, a wonderfully verdant and
deceptively tranquil oasis designed by John Lee Beatty. She
survives by withdrawing from her tormenters and just refuses to
fight when her imaginary and real families battle over her soul.
   Much of this is accomplished with high humor. The playwright
pricks the social, moral and cultural conventions of a lower middle
class where appearances count most. It's the one thing Ayckbourne's
heroine can't keep up with.
   Under Lynn Meadow's sensitive direction, Stockard Channing gives
a compelling, unsentimental performance as Ayckbourn's haunted
heroine. It's a wide-ranging portrait, capturing the character's
acerbic humor as well as her ever-increasing despair. The actress,
almost unrecognizable, is a lumpy vision of growing dementia. She
wears an unattractive, flower-print dress, and her hair gives new
meaning to the term ``dishwater blond.''
   Her two families are not of equal interest, and the disparity
shows in the performances. Remak Ramsay is superbly self-absorbed
as the vicar, and Patricia Conolly turns in a masterful job as the
lethal cook and relentess sister-in-law. There is also a gentle,
low-key and thoroughly ingratiating performance from Simon Jones as
the well-meaning doctor.
   Susan's fantasy family is not as well defined, and such fine
actors as Daniel Gerroll and Michael Countryman _ Susan's idealized
husband and brother _ must struggle to make them seem more than
just comic devices.
   To his credit, Ayckbourn doesn't make Susan completely
sympathetic, but gives her several abusive tirades which
demonstrate why her husband and son have turned away.
   The playwright also keeps the audience off-center and at arms
length. As Susan descends further and further into insanity,
Ayckbourn darkens the comedy. The audience still laughs, but it's a
nervous laughter born out of the bleakness of the situation.
``Woman in Mind'' never forgets the humor in the horror _ a
remarkable balancing act well worth seeing.
