   A woman pleaded innocent Saturday to a
charge that she killed one of her five former husbands, who died
two years ago of arsenic poisoning, but she remained in jail in
lieu of $200,000 bond, authorities said.
   Joan Hensley Davis, 54, was arrested Friday and charged with
first-degree murder in the 1986 death of James H. Hensley, said St.
Clair County State's Attorney John Baricevic.
   ``My client is in disbelief about the whole thing,'' attorney
Judy Cates said in a telephone interview.
   The southern Illinois woman, who now has a sixth husband, is
``not wealthy'' and was having trouble coming up with the bond,
Mrs. Cates said.
   Her husband ``is standing beside her,'' said Mrs. Cates, who did
not know his name.
   Ms. Davis was widowed by two of her husbands and was divorced
from the other three, Mrs. Cates said.
   Ms. Davis entered her innocent plea before Associate Judge
Robert Craig, who informed her she could face a minimum of 20 years
and a maximum of 40 years if convicted.
   Hensley, 62, of Shiloh, died March 8, 1986, at Memorial Hospital
in Belleville, and the initial autopsy showed he had died from
arsenic poisoning, said Illinois State Police Capt. Philip Kocis.
   ``It's unusual for a case to be charged two years after the
offense,'' Baricevic said. ``But we didn't feel we had enough
evidence to present to a jury until now.
   ``We had some problems, and all the questions about them will be
answered at the trial. We'd rather not discuss them until the
trial.''
   ``In an in-depth investigation like this, there are obviously no
witnesses to the crime. We have to rule out all accidental causes,
so it takes a long time,'' Kocis said.
   He said the death of the other man who died while being married
to Ms. Davis was not currently under investigation, but he refused
to say whether it had ever been investigated. He said he did not
know the man's name or when he died.
   ``The investigation is concentrated on (Hensley's) death at this
particular time,'' Kocis said.
