<HEAD>It's `Sweet Revenge' to Blame it on the French</HEAD>

   Whom shall we blame for the staggeringly inept,
really stupid comedy ``Sweet Revenge'' airing tonight on cable's
TNT network?
   Let's blame the French.
   They produced ``Sweet Revenge'' and set it in Paris because
that's where they live, not because it's key to the story.
   Most everybody in the movie _ production crew and supporting
cast included _is French. This is not a French movie, however. It's
an American movie about Americans. It uses French actors who think
they can do American accents: ``Ehnd ouwhaat mekks yooo t'ink so?''
   Yes, blame the French. They think Jerry Lewis is a comic genius.
By all means, blame the French.
   You also can blame Carrie Fisher. She plays a bright, ambitious
corporate lawyer in an American law firm's Paris office (huh?), who
divorces her unpublished American writer husband. He's played by
John Sessions, pretending he's not British, which he is.
   The cheap plot device introduced by first-time screenwriter
Janet Brownwell is that Fisher has agreed to support him after he
put her through law school.
   For some reason, they divorce in New York, instead of Paris, and
the court orders her to pay him alimony until he remarries. Ah, you
say, that sounds stupid. Well, she's also sleeping with a senior
partner.
   But there's more! She conceives the fiendishly lame idea of
hiring an actress, coached in the attributes of her ex-husband's
feminine ideal, to seduce him into marriage.
   Brilliant, eh? But isn't this about what you'd expect of a
lawyer who represents herself in her own divorce?
   Maybe you'd like to blame Rosanna Arquette.
   She plays _ and this is a real stretch for her _ a neurotic
flibbertigibbet of an actress. She takes the job as feminine ideal,
dates the ex-husband and finds herself ... WHOOPS! ... falling in
love!
   When a scintilla of sexual tension arises, Arquette confesses
all. He kicks her out, but she returns to plead her love for him
and they reunite. Despite the presumed lesson she learned, she
agrees to his doltish revenge scheme.
   OK, blame both Arquette AND Fisher.
   They could not have read this script and said, ``This is a
well-written, romantic comedy that challenges me as an actress.''
They must have read it and said, `Hey, this thing shoots for a
month in Paris!''
   Blame Brownwell, whose screenplay turned an idle fancy into
something really inane.
   ``My husband and I were sitting around one morning at breakfast,
discussing what we would do to one another if we got divorced,''
she told the movie's publicists. ``I said I would hire this
incredibly beautiful woman to whom I would teach all his secrets.
He would fall in love with her and she would break his heart.''
   This is not the greatest idea ever to leave the breakfast table.
   Blame the director, Charlotte Brandstrom, who went to school at
UCLA and the American Film Institute director's program. This is
her second movie, and her work shows how some film school graduates
are versed in technique and utterly ignorant of real life.
   She shot most of her outdoor scenes in the same exclusive
Parisian shopping streets where she shot most of her interiors: in
the exclusive Hermes and Ungaro stores.
   She and Brownwell said the major element of the story is Fisher
and Arquette's relationship and what they learn from each other.
Well, maybe in some other movie.
   ``Sweet Revenge'' is so fatuously conceived that it constantly
calls attention to its lack of dramatic tension.
   The climactic scene, in which several loosely flapping plot ends
must be tied up, occurs at a Paris news conference called by the
faithless senior partner who's presumably been living and working
in Europe for a couple of years while sleeping with Fisher.
   The news conference is to announce the senior partner's
candidacy for the U.S. Senate. That's right, he's announcing his
candidacy in Paris.
   He's no doubt hoping to represent a state with a large French
population, like the great state of Grey Poupon.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   STUPID PET TRICKS REDUX: Can you see the potential of an entire
half-hour of ``Stupid Pet Tricks''? Well, maybe that's why you
shouldn't work at CBS. Tonight, the network premieres ``Prime Time
Pets,'' a summer replacement look at some of the nicest critters
with fur, feathers and scales, hosted by Wil Shriner.
   The home video-style clips are mercifully brief. Some actually
are funny. And there's a nice segment on a trained dog who helps a
disabled child.
   None of the show is particularly memorable, and CBS' reluctance
to pick it up in light of ABC's hugely successful ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' could be showing us the tail-end of the home
video boom.
