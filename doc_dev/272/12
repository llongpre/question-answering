'Whether a man marries or not, he will live to regret it.' - Socrates
SUCH CYNICISM is not confined to the fourth century BC. It extends also to
royal marriages in the 20th century.
It was not the tabloid press which exposed what the archbishop of the day
referred to, rather delicately, as 'The King's Matter,' in 1936.
The press, in the person of its proprietors, was committed to what now seems
an extraordinary anachronism, a gentleman's agreement to keep silent. But
when the storm broke, and the king abdicated, it was Archbishop Lang who
voiced the most severe criticisms. His God-speed was a notorious broadcast,
a dour blend of sympathy, snobbery and self-righteousness as the former king
'in the darkness left these shores'.
Lang dismissed the king's motives as 'a craving for private happiness,' and
then he said this: 'Even more strange and sad it is that he should have
sought his happiness in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles
of marriage, and within a social circle whose standards and ways of life are
alien to all the best instincts and traditions of his people.' So much for
our American cousins.
Next day Stanley Baldwin, the prime minister, sent Lang a letter written in
his own hand, praising what he had said and ending: 'It was the voice of
Christian England.'
Many in 'Christian England' thought otherwise. The majority of letters were
so critical and so abusive that they were kept from the archbishop. There
were some in Christian England who thought that less cant and more charity
might have been in order.
Today's archbishops are more understanding of marital difficulties in the
royal household. They are different men, and the climate of opinion has
changed.
Dr John Hapgood, archbishop of York, manages to take comfort from thinking
that the separation, rather than something more dramatic, indicates a desire
to remain faithful to the marriage vows. But if two years of separation
leads, as it probably will, to divorce, and divorce leads to a wish to
remarry, the archbishops will be in a very different position.
At present, there is no bar at all, either constitutional or emotional, to
Prince Charles becoming head of the Church of England. But that Church still
maintains the strictest marriage discipline of any church in the world. Its
official position, debated with such anguish over the past 20 years, is that
'in order to maintain the principle of life-long obligation which is
inherent in every legally contracted marriage, and is set out in the
plainest terms in the marriage service, the Church should not allow the use
of that service in the case of anyone who has a former partner still
living.'
The resolutions which set out this position were passed in the aftermath of
the abdication crisis. Before 1938, divorce was rare and carried severe
social penalties. The law required that people who needed to escape from bad
marriages must either commit adultery or pretend, convincingly, that they
had done so.
Even Lang recognised that this was a bad law, although he could not bring
himself to vote for change because any change would, in his view, contradict
the mind of Christ. The Divorce Reform Act, introduced successfully by AP
Herbert in 1937, widened the grounds for divorce just a little, but enough
to worry the Church.
At the same time, the leading member of the royal family, then even more
than now the embodiment of ideals, overthrew those ideals for the sake of
private happiness and threatened to make divorce fashionable.
The C of E responded with neither grace nor understanding but with criticism
and rules, confident that such rules were true to the teaching of Jesus, The
Church did so for the best of motives, to maintain the sacredness of
marriage.
Some of the bishops, Henslay Hanson of Durham in particular, were realistic.
They knew that to lock people into bad marriages by means of strict divorce
laws only created a miserable society in which adultery and prostitution
flourished. Marriages fail, divorce must be possible, but those who fail
must maintain the ideal by living a life of celibacy after divorce. Jesus
had said so. Did he not teach that 'anyone who divorces his wife, and
marries another, commits adultery against his wife?'
We think that divorce in our society, on almost any grounds, after just one
year of marriage, is lax. But at the time of Jesus, Jewish law allowed men
to divorce women (although not the other way round) on trivial grounds, such
as burning the toast; recommended divorce for more serious matters, like
talking with a man in the street; required divorce for sexual offences, like
flirting; but after any act of illicit sex, the law demanded that the woman
be stoned. She had made herself unclean and no one must touch her, neither
her husband nor her executioners.
In this context, Jesus is utterly outrageous. You men have made these
divorce laws for your own convenience, he says, because you are so
hard-hearted, so unforgiving. Your laws allow you to throw women out on the
streets, even to kill them, to preserve your own manhood, even when you
yourselves are unfaithful. But the God-given ideal is that if you marry, it
is for life. Even if your wife is unfaithful, you should forgive.
Small wonder that the disciples of Jesus found this so deeply shocking.
Better not to marry, they said, than to forgive adultery and take an unclean
woman back into the marital bed.
To take this teaching out of its context in Pharisaic Judaism, and make it
the basis for regulations about divorce and remarriage in the 20th century,
misses the point. It turns Jesus into another Pharisee. Gradually, the
Church is coming to recognise that marriage is a personal relationship
requiring forgiveness as well as faithfulness, and that the ideals of
marriage cannot be preserved by means of negative regulations about
remarriage.
Those resolutions, which captured the mind of the Church as it was in 1932,
were confirmed in 1957. But in 1985, the general synod of the Church of
England, after long and anguished debate, was asked to confirm the
resolutions again. The synod declined to do so. So it was asked to rescind
the resolutions. It declined to do that as well.
It was not a particularly elegant piece of fence-sitting; rather, it was a
grim, and probably last, attempt to maintain the ideals of marriage by means
of ecclesiastical rules. Holding to the ideal will be marginally more
difficult now that the family which is supposed to embody those ideals has
found them so difficult to sustain.
But the reality of knotted and broken relationships which form such a large
part of the human condition, will press upon the Church more strongly, the
more so because of the understanding of the two archbishops.
Those who experience the pain of divorce, and wish to remarry in church,
often do so, as I know from experience, from mixed motives. But, almost
invariably, there is some reaching out for an ideal, dimly understood, so
far elusive, but possibly something to do with God.
To meet such longings with ecclesiastical rules is to deny the grace, the
fidelity and the forgiveness which may, after all, be the essentials of what
Jesus taught about marriage.
