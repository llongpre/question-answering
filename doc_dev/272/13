   A woman unlucky in love found good fortune in
divorce when a paperwork error delayed her marital split long
enough for her husband to win the lottery.
   On Tuesday, a state appeals court upheld a judge's ruling
cutting Bonita Lynch in for $550,000 of her ex-husband's winnings.
   ``Fortune favored husband with a jackpot, but, because his
marriage had not ended, fortune dealt his wife a share,'' Judge
Noel Fidel wrote for the three-judge appeals panel. ``Though the
lottery was a windfall, spouses marry for better or for worse and
share no less in windfalls than in labor's wages.''
   Ms. Lynch had been living apart from her husband, Michael, for
about two years when she testified at an uncontested divorce
hearing on Feb. 10, 1987 that their marriage was irretrievably
broken.
   She should have gotten her divorce that day, but her lawyers had
given her husband the wrong date for the hearing, forcing a delay.
The matter still wasn't final 11 days later when her husband won
$2.2 milllion in the state lottery.
   Lynch, a computer expert, had bought the ticket with Donna
Williams, a girlfriend he married after the divorce became final.
He died last Oct. 30, but his widow fought on behalf of his estate
to keep his first wife from taking a cut.
   Under Tuesday's ruling, Lynch's widow gets to keep half the $2.2
million jackpot because half the ticket was hers to begin with. The
remaining $1.1 million will be split evenly between Lynch's first
wife and his estate.
   ``In Arizona, `it ain't over till it's over,''' said Bonita
Lynch's attorney, Kenneth J. Love, borrowing from Yogi Berra. Love
said Ms. Lynch had no comment on the ruling and did not want any
details about her released.
   J. Douglas McVay, a lawyer for Lynch's widow, said no decision
has been made on an appeal.
   A call to a Phoenix-area listing for Donna Lynch was not
immediately returned Tuesday.
   Michael and Bonita Lynch married in 1968 and separated in 1985.
He began living with Donna Williams in 1986. Bonita Lynch filed for
divorce the same year. After Lynch won the lottery, she filed for a
share of the winnings.
   Superior Court Judge Rufus Coulter awarded her a share on the
grounds all assets acquired during a marriage are community
property.
   Lynch appealed, saying that his ``will to union'' with his first
wife had ended by Feb. 10 and that it was her lawyers who made the
mistake.
   The appeals panel rejected the arguments, saying that the
paperwork errors were unintentional.
   ``This case displays the hand of chance,'' Fidel wrote.
   The appeals court also said it was unclear when the ``will to
union'' was really broken because the couple discussed
reconciliation through much of the separation.
   As late as 1987, Bonita Lynch helped her former husband ``in a
medical emergency, checked him into an alcoholic rehabilitation
program, and agreed to join him in family counseling,'' the court
said.
