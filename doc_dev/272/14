   A man described by an attorney as having
lived two lives left two women claiming to be his widow and fighting
over his $8 million estate.
   A trial is scheduled to start Monday in Circuit Court on which of
two wills left by Harry G. Davis is valid.
   Ruth Davis, 75, of Anniston, and Flossie Davis, 62, of
Tallahassee, Fla., claim to have been married at the same time to
Davis, a real estate developer and farmer in Calhoun County.
   Both women say they learned that their husband had two wives only
after his death.
   After Davis died last year at 77, Flossie Davis presented a will
she said he wrote in 1969 placing most of his estate in a trust fund
for her and their two children, said A.W. Bolt, an attorney for Ruth
Davis.
   Bolt said Ruth is contesting the will on grounds that Davis was
``under undue influence'' of Flossie when he wrote it. Bolt said a
1959 will leaving the estate to Ruth was found three weeks ago. She
and Davis had no children.
   Bolt said Davis lived two lives, spending weekends and holidays
with Flossie in Tallahassee and weekdays on the farm with Ruth.
   After about 30 years of marriage to Ruth, Bolt said, Davis met
the other woman in 1959, when she and her husband worked as tenant
farmers on his property. Bolt said Davis soon became entangled with
Flossie, that Flossie divorced her husband and, with her daughter,
moved in with the Davises.
   ``Ruth started noticing Harry and Flossie fondling one another,''
Bolt said, and she insisted that the other woman move out.
   Instead, Bolt said, Davis had Ruth institutionalized three times
for ``imagining things.''
   He said that while Ruth was under the influence of medication,
Davis had her sign a post-nuptial agreement that essentially cut her
out of any inheritance.
   Flossie claims Davis married her in 1960, and two years later
moved her and her daughter to Tallahassee. ``He bought her a home,
set her up and supported her the rest of his life,'' Bolt said.
   Ruth said she never knew about her husband's marriage to Flossie.
Pat Burnham, Flossie's attorney, said his client had thought her
husband divorced Ruth before their marriage.
