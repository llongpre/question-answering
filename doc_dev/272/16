<LEADPARA>  For many foreign-born women in the United States, notions like equality and
individual rights often seem little more than exotic and unobtainable ideals.;
   That became brutally evident to Hayward researcher Young Song after
interviewing 150 Korean women here a few years ago. Sixty percent said they'd
been beaten, slapped or otherwise battered by husbands. Yet few bothered to
seek help from authorities.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Koreans, Song discovered, tend to tolerate domestic violence as an
inevitable fact of life. To justify the abuse, some men even cite an old
Korean adage. "The real taste of dried fish and women," the saying goes, "can
only be derived from beating them once every three days.";    Even in the
United States, where feminists have fought long and hard for women's issues,
immigrants find little refuge from such age-old prejudices. In fact, language
barriers, high living costs and other factors frequently conspire to make
women from underdeveloped countries in Asia, Latin America and other parts of
the world feel even more helpless here than in their homelands.;    Some
become virtual slaves to their spouses, said Nilda Rimonte, executive director
of the Center for the Pacific Asian Family in Los Angeles. "In many of the
worst cases we have," she said, "the women are literally imprisoned in their
homes -- not allowed to watch TV or draw the drapes for fear that they'll
learn something nasty like women's liberation.";    Every culture harbors its
share of bullying husbands, local counselors say, and they stress that most
immigrant men treat their wives with affection and respect. But cultural and
economic pressures can put unique strains on newly arrived families --
especially since many men must take less prestigious jobs than they had in
their native countries.;    Legal residency;  The pressures can spill over
into nasty spats. And when husbands get demanding or violent, wives often feel
defenseless. One reason for that sense of vulnerability is that in many
immigrant families, husbands establish legal residency first. As a result,
wives often must rely on the men to petition the government so they can stay
here, too.;    The arrangement gives husbands considerable power over their
spouses, said Richard Konda, an attorney with Asian Law Alliance in San Jose,
particularly since it is common for wives to sneak into the country illegally.
Many husbands threaten their wives by saying, "I'm sending you back to your
country," Konda said. "'You're not going to be allowed to stay here.' ";   
Fearing such threats, many women are too afraid to call police. And many have
no relatives here to protect them, said Beckie Masaki, who runs the Asian
Women's Shelter in San Francisco. "The people who might support her or keep
the relationship more balanced," Masaki said, "are thousands of miles away."; 
  Mustering the courage to move out of such a relationship can be daunting for
women whose husbands have rarely allowed them out of their homes and who don't
know where to turn for help, said Edie Resto, of La Casa de las Madres, a Bay
Area support group for Hispanic women.;    Scared of being alone;  She cited
the case of Adelina Perea, a recent Mexican immigrant who was found "wandering
the streets with her children" after her husband abused her last year. Perea
had no idea what programs were available for abused wives and was scared of
being on her own.;    "I wasn't working," Perea explained in Spanish during a
recent interview. "I didn't have a driver's license. I didn't know San
Francisco. I didn't speak English. I didn't know anything. I was afraid -- for
me and for my children.";    She's enrolled in an English class now, works at
a variety of odd jobs, and is trying to make a new life for herself. "She was
lucky," Resto said. "She left." But a lot of immigrant wives simply put up
with miserable marriages. After all, counselors say, it's been pounded into
them from birth that they're expected to be docile and subservient.;    "When
we were young, our parents always taught us, 'You girls have to behave and be
obedient, because one day you have to obey your husband,' " said Tina Shum, a
social worker who counsels local Asian women. "We are taught not to talk back,
never to say no.";    In some poor villages in Asia, Shum said, "they like to
sacrifice a young girl" by marrying her off to an American, sometimes through
mail-order arrangements. That way, the girl can become a U.S. resident and
then petition her relatives to move here, too.;    In such cases, the young
woman typically is reluctant to challenge her husband's authority, fearing it
might hurt her relatives' chances to immigrate. "The girl has to be thankful
to this man and worship him as a god because he can save them," Shum said.;   
Divorce considered shameful;  Even if they wanted to leave their husbands,
many women assume they have little legal right to do so. In some Asian
cultures, women have few property or inheritance rights, and divorce is
considered shameful. Many Chinese women who come to the United States
mistakenly assume they can't end a marriage without approval from their
husband or their parents, Shum said.;    Those who choose to stick with their
husbands often work like dogs to keep them happy.;    Julia Esther Curry
Rodriguez, a University of California, Berkeley professor who has studied
Mexican immigrant women, wrote about one who always started her day around
3:30 a.m. at the insistence of her husband.;    "Pedro likes me to look good
by the time he gets up," the woman explained. "It takes me an hour and a half
to bathe, put on my makeup and get dressed. Then I have to make breakfast,
which must be served by 5:30 a.m. I leave for work at 6:30 and make sure that
the kitchen is clean and the beds are made.";    Women typically show similar
deference to mothers-in-law and brothers. Zaida McCall-Perez, who runs an
English-language school in Hayward, has noticed a particularly protective and
prudish attitude among the male siblings of some of her female Afghani
students.;    "We've had older brothers out of school driving around campus
here to keep vigilant about younger sisters who they heard were flirting with
boys," she said.;    Women frustrated by not winning instant liberation in the
United States sometimes sink into deep depression. Some even contemplate
suicide, local counselors say. But not all. A lot of women rebel.;    Forced
to find jobs because of the region's exorbitant housing and other costs, many
immigrant women here now earn far more than their husbands. That has given
them a powerful voice over how to run their households, which in some cases
has increased family conflicts. Counselors say divorce rates among some ethnic
groups is on the increase.;    Then again, many immigrant men also have
changed, even though for many macho types it has been tough, said Antonio
Ramirez, who runs a counseling program for Bay Area Hispanic wife beaters.;   
In the Hispanic culture, "men are supposed to have power and control over
women," Ramirez said. "We expect women to take care of us, to nurture us. Men
do not want to give that privilege away."  </TEXT>
