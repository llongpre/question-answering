FT  27 JUL 94 / Arts: A crooked Lady Windermere's Fan - Theatre

For many years now it has been impossible to play Lady Windermere's Fan
straight, unless to an improbably innocent audience. (Perhaps 50 years ago
in England; in the rest of the world, at least 80.) It was Oscar Wilde's
first professional play, and it is hopelessly split.
If we relish Oscar's wit in the marginal chat, we cannot take Lord and Lady
Windermere's lofty protestations about marriage very seriously; but if we
cannot do that, the very hinges of the plot become quaint and ludicrous. At
the Albery Theatre, Philip Prowse's production - imported from the
Birmingham Rep - plays it crooked.
On the one hand the fringe characters, who get most of the familiar,
subversively witty lines, are encouraged toward shameless camp, which makes
the Windermere ball in Act 2 a decidedly louche affair, wildly unlikely in
its period (or at least unreportable). On the other, both Windermeres are
treated at face value, as fanatic idealists who pass absolute moral
judgments upon others. They are only half-confounded at the end; the last
thing we see is Lord Windermere in a brown study, deeply baffled because he
has misunderstood everything.
Well he might, however, for there is an 'on the third hand' too: Francesca
Annis's Mrs Erlynne. She gives her the full Joan Collins treatment in public
 -scandalous, surely, at a respectable Mayfair gathering? - but manages some
nice feeling in her anguished private confessions. (I have to deny you the
full facts, since some of you won't know the play; it will be enough to say
that the adventuress Mrs Erlynne is more than she seems.) As Wilde wrote her
she is an eminently presentable, savvy woman-of-the-world, whereas Miss
Annis makes her a larger-than-life siren.
Though Miss Annis just about reconciles her flamboyant persona with discreet
moments of real emotion, it is a near thing. Prowse's handling of the
subsidiary personnel is too gross: we have no reason to believe in
strangulated Victorian mores when hardly anybody on stage seems to believe
in them. By Act 3 in the Prowse version, the first-night audience was
greeting every lofty Victorian declaration with raucous laughter.
As young, well-heeled Windermere, with only two years of marriage behind
him, Rupert Frazer is peculiarly stiff and curdled. Amanda Elwes is worse:
she cannot talk Wilde's rarefied lingo with any semblance of naturalness, so
she aims at unspoken character instead. By Act 3 that makes itself felt a
little (we remember her attractive performances on TV); but both the earlier
acts - in this version - begin with a lot of her, and she delivered her
lines like a robotic alien. The initial banter with her vain swain Lord
Darlington (Simon Dutton) was hopelessly leaden, her melodramatic Act 2
scena devoid of the least conviction.
That was not altogether her fault (though one felt that Central School might
have prepared her better). The real trouble is that as Wilde wrote her - his
original title for the play was A Good Woman - she now seems at best a prig
and a ninny, at worst a raving hysteric; and Miss Elwes, grave and
humourless, plays her for real. What Wilde intended for the Windermeres,
which was idealised rapture founded upon inexperience, turns into
puritanical craziness. We do not believe a word of it; and so they, not the
mockers, become the out-of-joint outsiders.
Perhaps that is what Prowse intended. If so, it carries less conviction than
his own sumptuously OTT sets: a huge boudoir for Acts 1 and 3, artfully
off-centre and festooned in deeply unlikely hues for Victorian times, and
between them - for Lord Darlington's rooms in his club - a dramatic crescent
of grand chinoiserie. That was warmly applauded.
There are a lot of enterprising actors in short-breathed roles. Jennifer
Hilary makes a ripe Duchess of Berwick - if too modern and knowing, in the
generous room this production gives her - but almost vanishes after the
first act, as does Marianne Morley's crisp Lady Jedburgh. (Wilde's parade of
fictitious titled characters, both onstage and off, seems absurd now: why
should they be titled? what does it matter?) Frank Middlemass's Lord
Augustus, broad and lovable, and Leonard Kavanagh's discreet butler remind
us pleasantly of how such roles used to be played - simply,
straightforwardly and clearly.
