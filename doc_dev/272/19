<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- I have had male friends, no sex involved, for the last 25 of my 33
years of marriage. Odd? Not really. My husband, a wonderful person and a
successful businessman, has never made an effort to meet my emotional needs.
His life consists of work, coming home to eat with the TV turned on, and then
reading the newspaper in his comfortable chair until bedtime. On weekends he
sleeps or performs business-related activities.;   I was a gregarious person
when we married and enjoyed being with friends. All that ended because my
husband "meets people all week long, and the last thing he wants to do on
weekends is socialize."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The way I see it, my husband has a precious commodity which increases in
value as the years go by: me. In addition to my job, I've cleaned, cooked
terrific meals and raised three sons. I've been my husband's sounding board
whenever he has needed a listening ear. I never refuse to accommodate him
sexually, even though sex to him is for his pleasure only.;   After repeatedly
asking him to consider my needs and suggesting that we both go for counseling,
he said, "I'm a happy man. I don't need counseling." So, I opted for the
other-man relationship.;   I've had several male friends over the years. In
each case, we enjoyed one another's company until he found a woman to marry.
At that point, another man comes along to take his place.;   My typical male
friend is a professional between 30 and 50, unmarried, who is fed up with
women who have tried to trap him into marriage when he's not ready. While my
current "friend" is not interested in marriage or sex, he longs for a
relationship with a woman who is willing to listen to him, laugh with him and
share his joys and sorrows. He's willing to do the same. He doesn't feel
threatened because he knows I love my husband and have no interest in getting
a divorce.;   By now you must be wondering how my husband feels about this.
Well, he says the other man in my life is a valuable commodity to him as well.
It relieves him of spending the time and energy required to be a friend to me.
In turn, the freedom he gives me ensures against having an unhappy, neglected,
nagging wife. Perfect? No, but it suits me just fine. Care to comment?;   --
Doing the Next Best Thing in Jackson, Miss.;   DEAR NEXT BEST THING -- The
design for living you have described may be just dandy for you and your
husband and the transient males who parade through your life, but it is
nothing I would recommend.;   It sounds to me as if you have a sterile and
meaningless marriage with a man who is self-absorbed, inconsiderate and
totally disconnected from you. You say he is a "wonderful person" and that you
love him. I wonder why.;   Keep my address handy. I wouldn't be surprised if
you wrote again to ask what to do about a nice, platonic relationship that
suddenly turned into a love affair.  </TEXT>
