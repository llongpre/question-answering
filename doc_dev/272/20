<DESCRIPT>  US; COURT; TRIAL; END  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  One of the nation's most prolonged and bitter divorce cases ended Monday at
the Supreme Court. The lawyers won.;   The couple, who disputed virtually
every issue during a seven-year Los Angeles court war, finally had agreed on
something -- that the $3 million in fees charged by their lawyers was
excessive.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HIGH COURT BRINGS EPIC DIVORCE CASE TO END  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     So the ex-husband and ex-wife allied to fight the fees all the way to the
Supreme Court. But the court refused to hear their argument that they had a
constitutional right to use new lawyers to cross-examine their divorce lawyers
about the fees.;   Millionaires Stanley and Dorothy Diller were the
antagonists in the epic divorce case. There were 110 court hearings and a
marathon trial lasting 49 days. The court reporter's transcript consumed 5,165
pages in 20 volumes more than 6 feet high.;   "No amount of advice from the
judge deterred the parties from their obsession to grind on with the
litigation, without concern as to its costs or consumption of time. . . . If a
trial could go on forever, this trial would have been a candidate for that
dire distinction," a California appeals judge wrote in reviewing the case in
May.;   Earlier, the trial judge, Robert Fainer, had approved the lawyers' fee
requests after recording his observations of the Dillers, who divorced after
28 years of marriage.;   Their personalities, he wrote, "explain and justify
the substantial time spent by the lawyers.";   He described Dorothy Diller as
"a frightened, bitter woman" who was "obsessed" by her belief that her husband
was concealing community property and asserted "unprovable claims of
misconduct" by her husband.;   Her husband, the judge wrote, was "an
avaricious, covetous, stubborn man" who had "almost daily disputes with his
lawyers" and was "evasive, uncooperative, distrustful, discourteous,
unyielding and self-righteous."  </TEXT>
