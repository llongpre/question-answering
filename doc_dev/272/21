   Princess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth
II, is separating from her husband Mark Phillips after 15 years of
marriage, but they do not plan to divorce, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The queen, on holiday at Balmoral, Scotland, was described by
royal sources to be ``obviously saddened'' but to understand the
couple's decision, which was taken in principle earlier this year,
according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
   ``Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and Capt. Mark Phillips
have decided to separate on terms agreed between them,'' the
announcement said. ``There are no plans for divorce proceedings.''
   The terms of the separation were not disclosed but Anne, 39, will
continue to live at the couple's home, Gatcombe Park in
Gloucestershire, 80 miles west of London. Phillips, 40, will move to
another house nearby, the palace said.
   The palace press office could not say whether this would be Aston
Farm on the Gatcombe estate.
   The couple's children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 8, will live with
their mother at Gatcombe, and Phillips will have full access to
them, the palace said.
   Princess Anne, in Puerto Rico for a meeting of the International
Olympic Committee, brushed past reporters this morning without
answering questions.
   It was only the second formal rupture of a marriage within the
immediate royal family in this century, said Sue Goddard, manager of
Burke's Peerage.
   Ms. Goddard could not recall another instance since George IV
attempted to divorce his wife shortly before he ascended to the
throne in 1820. Before that, she said, there was no royal divorce
since Henry VIII and his six marriages in the 16th century.
   The separation announced by the palace today was disclosed
Wednesday night by Phillips' father, Maj. Peter Phillips.
   Rumors of trouble in the marriage date back to 1981. In recent
years, Anne and Phillips have spent periods of up to six months
apart.
   Speculation that their marriage was on the rocks arose most
recently in April, after personal letters written to Anne by a
handsome 35-year-old aide to the queen, naval Cmdr. Timothy
Laurence, were stolen and sent to the tabloid The Sun.
   Phillips' name has been linked romantically with several women in
British tabloid reports in recent years.
   Princess Margaret, 59, the queen's only sister, was divorced in
1978 from photographer Lord Snowdon. He has remarried. She has not.
   As in the case of Anne, who is seventh in line to the throne, the
palace repeatedly denied that Margaret's marriage was in trouble.
   
   A common view that has taken hold this century is that the royal
family, as a symbol of national unity, is supposed to set an example
for the nation.
   Before Margaret's divorce, British news media often depicted the
royals as the ideal family. But the divorce showed they could not
meet that expectation and cost them some of the unquestioning
respect they had enjoyed.
   Sniping at the royals _ their glamorous, privileged lives, wealth
and taxpayer money they receive to help carry out their duties _ now
is commonplace.
   Anne, a former member of Britain's Olympic equestrian team, and
Phillips, an ex-Army captain and Olympic equestrian gold medalist,
met through their love of horses.
   They married in London's Westminster Abbey Nov. 14, 1973, in a
televised ceremony viewed by an estimated worldwide audience of 500
million.
   Anne, who is head of the International Equestrian Federation, was
attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in Puerto Rico
today, and bodyguards and aides kept reporters away from her. She is
due to return to Britain by mid-September after traveling to Belize,
Honduras, Ecuador and Bolivia.
   Phillips remained Wednesday at Gatcombe Park.
   His father's statement said Phillips, a commoner who farms and
trains horses, ``will go on managing the work on the estate and will
continue to organize the horse trials and the stables.''
   Phillips has traveled widely for business and equestrian
interests.
   Anne has become one of the busiest members of the royal family as
president of the Save the Children Fund, a charity that helps poor
children worldwide.
   On April 6, The Sun, Britain's biggest-circulation paper with a
daily sale of 4 million copies, reported it had been handed four
stolen letters written to Anne by a man it did not identify.
   It did not disclose the contents but said it passed them to
police. On April 8, the palace identified Laurence as the writer to
try to halt intense news media speculation.
   Phillips told reporters at that time that his marriage was ``fine
and happy.''
   On Aug. 23, the queen personally awarded Laurence the Royal
Victorian Order as he left her service after three years as her
equerry to take command of a frigate. The citation said the order
was awarded for ``extraordinary, important or personal services to
the sovereign or the royal family.''
