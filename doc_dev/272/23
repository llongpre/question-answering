   Paulette Goddard, the wide-eyed, waiflike actress
who co-starred with husband Charlie Chaplin in films such as ``The
Great Dictator'' and ``Modern Times,'' died Monday at her home in
southern Switzerland.
   A municipal employee in the village of Ronco said official
records show the actress was born on June 3, 1905, making her 84.
However, reference books give her year of birth as 1915 or 1911.
   The employee, Pia DellaMora, said the exact cause of death was
not known ``but one could assume she died of old age.'' A member of
her household said the actress had a brief illness.
   Ms. Goddard, born Marion Levy in Whitestone, N.Y., began her
career on stage in New York. Her Hollywood debut came with a small
part in ``The Girl Habit'' in 1931, the first of more than 40
movies. She starred alongside Chaplin in ``Modern Times'' in 1936
and ``The Great Dictator'' in 1940.
   Their marriage, her second, ended in divorce in 1942.
   Other films in which the actress had leading roles included
``Dramatic School,'' ``Nothing but the Truth,'' ``I Love a
Soldier,'' ``The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' ``Woman of Vengeance''
and a 1947 British production, ``An Ideal Husband.'' Her last TV
film was ``The Snoop Sisters.''
   Her third marriage, to American actor Burgess Meredith, broke up
in 1944.
   In 1958, she married Erich Maria Remarque, the German-born
American novelist. He became famous in the 1920s for his anti-war
``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' which was banned in Nazi
Germany.
   They settled in Ronco, a picturesque hillside village close to
the Italian frontier and overlooking Lago Maggiore. Remarque died
in 1970.
   Ms. DellaMora said Ms. Goddard was to be cremated with funeral
ceremonies planned for Thursday.
