   Kathleen Sullivan, the soon-to-be-divorced CBS
anchorwoman, says she's looking for a date, preferably a ``rugged
outdoorsman.''
   ``I need a date for next Monday night,'' she told Joan Rivers
during a taping of ``The Joan Rivers Show'' to be aired Feb. 1.
``Do you know anyone?''
   Her ideal man is ``6 feet 2, 185 pounds about, sandy hair,
rugged outdoorsman _ someone who likes to ride, fish, hunt ... with
a certain amount of pride and stability,'' Sullivan said.
   The anchorwoman of ``CBS This Morning'' said of her current
marital status, ``I'm a divorced woman, or soon-to-be-divorced,
what time is it?'' and described as ``hard'' the breakup of her
marriage.
   Her husband, she said, ``is a very good friend. The saddest
thing was that he couldn't move to New York or wouldn't move to New
York. And he wouldn't share my life and it was very hard for me to
share his. So it became a fait accompli.''
   Her husband, real estate developer Michael Kiner, lives in Palm
Springs, Calif.
