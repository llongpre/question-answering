   Married couples are more likely to
divorce if the woman has more education than her husband, a study
concludes.
   The study found that the divorce rate for marriages in which the
wife has more schooling than her husband is over 50 percent higher
than it is for marriages in which the husband has the same or higher
educational achievement.
   ``Apparently many men and women have not been socialized to
accept the notion of a woman being educationally more accomplished
than her husband,'' said Neil G. Bennett, an associate professor of
sociology at Yale University, who led the study.
   That women are better able to support themselves and less fearful
of going it alone, could account for the higher rate of divorce,
Bennett said.
   ``We might have expected that couples who had very different
levels of education, regardless of which spouse had the higher
education, would have higher divorce rates than average because
these couples would have different world views and be subject to
greater conflict and stress in their marriage.
   ``But that was not true. We found only couples in which the wife
was more educated than the husband had higher divorce rates than
average,'' Bennett said in an interview Wednesday.
   In the United States, about half of all marriages today will end
in divorce.
   Bennett's study has not been published, but the results were
presented last month at the American Sociological Association in San
Francisco.
   The study was based on data from nearly 3,500 married or divorced
women under age 50, collected by the National Survey of Families and
Households between March 1987 and May 1988.
   Bennett received widespread attention three years ago when he
concluded that single, college-educated women over age 30 had only a
20 percent chance of getting married. A Census Bureau researcher,
studying the same statistics, disputed his findings, and said those
same women actually have a 66 percent chance of eventually marrying.
   Bennett has done a new study on the same subject with more recent
data, but the results will not be made public until they are
published in November.
   In looking at divorce rates, the Yale researchers also examined
the effects of religious differences on marriages. Not unexpectedly,
they found that divorce rates are higher for couples in interfaith
marriages.
   When a wife and husband have different religion, but both are not
very religious, the divorce rate is not much different from the
average, the study found.
   To study the effect of educational differences, the women and men
were placed in four different educational categories: those with
less than a high school education, those with a high school
education, those with some college education and those with at least
a college degree.
   Bennett emphasized that men and women who marry someone who has a
substantially different education, religous belief or age are
generally less traditional than those who marry people with similar
characteristics, and may therefore have less conventional views
about marriage to begin with. Such factors, however, cannot be
measured.
