   Paulette Goddard, the wide-eyed, waiflike actress
who co-starred with husband Charlie Chaplin in films such as ``The
Great Dictator'' and ``Modern Times,'' died Monday at her home in
southern Switzerland.
   A municipal employee in the village of Ronco said official
records show the actress was born June 3, 1905, making her 84.
However, reference books give her year of birth as 1911 or 1915.
   The employee, Pia DellaMora, said the exact cause of death was
not known ``but one could assume she died of old age.'' A member of
her household said the actress had a brief illness.
   Ms. Goddard, born Marion Levy in Whitestone, N.Y., began her
career on stage in the New York show ``Rio Rita.'' Her Hollywood
debut came with a small part in ``The Girl Habit'' in 1931, the
first of 40-plus movies.
   As a member of the Hal Roach Studio stock company, she starred
with Chaplin in two of his classics, ``Modern Times'' in 1936 and
``The Great Dictator'' in 1940.
   Their marriage, her second, ended in divorce in 1942.
   ``She turned out to be a fine actress,'' Bob Hope said Monday
from his Los Angeles home. ``She was everything. She was beautiful.
She was perfect.''
   Hope, who appeared with Ms. Goddard in the movies ``The Cat and
the Canary'' in 1939, ``The Ghost Breakers'' in 1940 and ``Nothing
But the Truth'' in 1941, recalled how he was flattered when his
hero Chaplin told him, ``You've got great timing.''
   ``It was a very big moment in my professional life,'' Hope said.
``When I was a kid I used to do an imitation of him. Now, here I
was, acting with his wife and he paid me a compliment.''
   Other films in which the actress had leading roles included
``Dramatic School,'' ``I Love a Soldier,'' ``The Diary of a
Chambermaid'' and a 1947 British production, ``An Ideal Husband.''
Her last TV film was ``The Snoop Sisters.''
   Her third marriage, to American actor Burgess Meredith, broke up
in 1944.
   In 1958, she married Erich Maria Remarque, the German-born
American novelist. He became famous in the 1920s for his anti-war
``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' which was banned in Nazi
Germany.
   They settled in Ronco, a picturesque hillside village close to
the Italian frontier and overlooking Lago Maggiore. Remarque died
in 1970.
   ``She was such a wonderful girl, a real woman with a lot of
wit,'' said actor Macdonald Carey from his Beverly Hills, Calif.,
home. ``Sometimes actresses are known for only one anecdote or
something, but she was much more down to earth than that.''
   Carey appeared opposite Miss Goddard in the 1948 comedy
``Hazard'' and in the 1949 film ``Bride of Vengeance.''
   Ms. DellaMora said Ms. Goddard was to be cremated with funeral
ceremonies planned for Thursday.
