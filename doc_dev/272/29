<LEADPARA>  DON'T KNOW what to get your husband for Christmas this year? Allow me to
recommend The Ideal Man Talking Doll.;   Ideal Man says all the right things
at the push of a button, says the company. "Drop some hints to the 'real' man
in your life with The Ideal Man Doll. Eight romantic expressions give you the
respect you deserve -- 'How about a nice long massage?,' 'I respect your
career,' 'Here's a glass of wine, I will light a fire,' 'You relax and I will
do the dishes,' 'Your smile makes my day,' 'Let me hold you, I need your
warmth,' 'You look wonderful' and 'You inspire me.' "  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It is a sad commentary on the state of interpersonal relations that
somebody had to invent Ideal Man because he could not be found in nature.
Instead, women have to content themselves with Less Than Ideal Man, Far From
Ideal Man and Ideal Jerk Man. For far less than $39.95, you can take one of
these men home and, without inserting batteries or pushing a button, hear
eight or more expressions that have the romantic potential of ear wax,
including:;   "Where's my dinner?";   "Fetch me a beer, would ya?";   "Didn't
I tell you I invited the guys over to watch the game?";   "Are you putting on
weight?";   "Of course I'm listening, I just didn't hear what you said.";  
"That's nothing. Let me tell you about my day.";   "What do you mean I don't
do my share of the housework. I take the trash out, don't I?";   "OK, but
let's make it a quickie.";   Obviously, Ideal Man is long overdue and will
undoubtedly be the inspiration for various other perfect people, including:;  
Ideal Woman: "I've always been attracted to men with beer bellies/receding
hairlines/no money.";   "I'll try to remember to put the toilet seat back
up.";   "Actually, I'd like power tools for an anniversary present.";   Ideal
Child: "No TV for me until I get my grades up.";   "I'm in no hurry to have
sex.";   "I can't stand a messy room.";   "What do you think I should do with
my money?";   Ideal Employee: "Come in Saturday? No problem.";   "No, boss,
you deserve all the credit.";   "Actually, I enjoy working with asbestos.";  
Incidentally, if you need an Ideal Man, he sells for $39.95 and is available
through the Anatomical Chart Co., telephone: 1-800-621-7500.  </TEXT>
