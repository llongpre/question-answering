   Seventy-nine percent of Soviet women and 43
percent of U.S. women think alcoholism is a chief cause of divorce,
a poll shows.
   Poor communication wrecks most marriages, 77 of the American
women said in the survey. They ranked alcoholism second, while 39
percent of Soviet women ranked parental interference second.
   The survey, based on an unscientific sampling, was conducted by
Woman's Day, a U.S. magazine geared toward suburban women, and
Krestyanka, a Soviet magazine whose name translates as, ``Peasant
Woman,'' although 54 percent of its respondents identified
themselves as white-collar.
   ``This survey reveals there's nothing foreign about domestic
difficulties,'' said Ellen R. Levine, Woman's Day editor in chief.
   ``Soviet and American women have more in common than they may
have thought: too much work, troubled marriages, husbands who won't
help, and alcoholism.''
   ``Stress is the great equalizer,'' said Ethel Klein, associate
professor of political science at Columbia University, who
interpreted the poll for Woman's Day. ``Women have hit a strong
stress point in both societies.''
   Fifty-six percent of the Soviet women surveyed said an ideal
husband should be faithful and a good head of the family. More than
63 percent of American women mentioned ``communicative,''
``emotionally supportive'' and ``faithful'' as the virtues of the
ideal husband.
   Only 2 percent of American women thought good homemaking skills
make an ideal husband. Still, 61 percent said American men must
assume more responsibility for housework and 50 percent wanted men
to help more with child care. Twenty percent of the Soviet women
said men should do more at home and 13 percent said men should spend
more time raising their kids.
   The surveys were conducted by mail so that rural Soviet women
without phones could be included. Women's Day received about 30,000
responses from women with a median age of 41; more than
three-quarters are married and almost 90 percent have children.
Krestyanka got back about 200,000 responses, with a median age of
30, three-fourths married and 78 percent with children.
   The Yankelovich Clancy Shulman polling firm tabulated the Woman's
Day results.
