   A divorcee who was told by the state
Supreme Court that she cannot let her boyfriend spend the night
while her three children are home has appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court, her lawyer said Monday.
   Carla J. Parrillo's appeal asserts that the state court deprived
her of a ``fundamental right to be free from government influence
within the confines of her own home,'' said Patrica A. Hurst, an
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.
   Hurst said the state decision, in a case initiated by Ms.
Parrillo's ex-husband, has affected her client's rights as a parent
to ``organize the care and custody of her children'' and ``to
conduct her life as she deems fit.''
   ``The fact that the state of Rhode Island stepped into her home
to regulate her conduct is something that we all find very
offensive,'' Hurst said at a news conference.
   ``Until someone can prove that I'm harming my children, I will
continue to live my life as I see fit,'' Ms. Parrillo, 33, of
Johnston, said Monday.
   The state Supreme Court upheld a Family Court decision in March,
saying ``we see no great constitutional issue in this controversy.''
   Ms. Parrillo's boyfriend ``may still visit the marital domicile
overnight, with the exception of those times when the children are
with their mother,'' the court wrote.
   Hurst had argued that the 1986 decision by Family Court Judge
William Goldberg, now retired, was based on the judge's personal
opinions on family life.
   ``A transcript of the conversation between the trial justice and
the children is devoid of any facts which could support the judge's
inference'' of harm to the children, Hurst said. She added that
Goldberg rejected her request to have an independent psychologist
examine the children to determine if the overnight visits were
harming them.
   Ms. Parrillo and her husband, Justin Parrillo Jr., were divorced
in May 1986 after seven years of marriage and she was given custody
of her children, aged 9, 11 and 13 at the time. He was given
visitation rights.
   In June, the Parrillos returned to Family Court. Ms. Parrillo
wanted her ex-husband to see the children away from her home.
Parrillo wanted his ex-wife restrained from having any unrelated
males stay overnight at her house.
   Ms. Parrillo maintained that overnight visits by her boyfriend,
Joseph DiPippo, once or twice a week caused no harm to her
children. She testified that they liked DiPippo, but she did not
plan to marry him in the near future.
   Parrillo felt his children didn't like the situation, and
noticed a change in their behavior, according to his attorney,
Thomas DeSimone.
   The children told Goldberg in a private meeting that they all
got along well with DiPippo, although the eldest said there were
times he did not like the man.
   The judge ruled the overnight visits ``in the presence of the
children were not conducive to their general well-being, at least
in terms of their psychological welfare,'' the high court noted.
   Goldberg said if Ms. Parrillo married DiPippo, the issue would
become moot.
   ``No one gave Carla Parrillo credit for knowing what was right
for her kids as a mother,'' said Hurst, who maintained Ms.
Parrillo's decision to introduce a man to the family slowly was
easier on the children than an abrupt marriage.
