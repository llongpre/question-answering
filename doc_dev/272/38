   Premier Andreas Papandreou has taken the
Greeks by surprise again; but this time the focus is on his
personal life and not his politics.
   The 69-year-old premier, who is awaiting open-heart surgery in
London, last week announced he intends to divorce his American-born
wife Margaret after 37 years of marriage.
   The announcement came after Papandreou was pictured in Greek
newspapers strolling hand-in-hand through hospital grounds with his
companion Dimitra Liani, a 34-year-old flight attendant.
   In a country where politicians' private lives usually attract
little media attention, the socialist premier took the
unprecedented step of disclosing his relationship with the tall,
blonde Ms. Liani.
   Opinion is divided about the possible effects on his
government's popularity.
   A parliamentarian with Papandreou's governing Panhellenic
Socialist Movement, who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ``My
constituents are farmers with old-fashioned views about family
life, and I'll have a hard time explaining this (the planned
divorce) away.''
   But political analysts point out that previous disclosures about
Papandreou's private life failed to affect his approval rating.
   The analysts say the premier's refusal to appoint a stand-in
during his hospitalization in England is much more likely to erode
support for his party.
   ``Papandreou has a history of womanizing that never dented his
political appeal. But his absence leaves a power vacuum that makes
it clear PASOK is unlikely to survive unless he makes a miraculous
recovery,'' said Stratis Stratigis, a lawmaker with the liberal
opposition Democratic Renewal party.
   During seven years in power, Papandreou has skillfully
stage-managed abrupt changes in economic and foreign policy without
endangering his government's popularity. But his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement now faces the prospect of fighting national
elections due by mid-1989 with a weakened leader.
   Papandreou flew to London on August 25 for treatment of a
narrowing of the aorta, the main blood vessel carrying blood from
the heart.
   The premier's planned surgery at Harefield Hospital to replace a
heart valve has been postponed several times because of a liver
problem.
   The operation now is expected to take place in late September at
the earliest, according to his doctors.
   In the meantime, Papandreou is advising the government by
telephone, and senior Cabinet ministers take turns flying to London
for instructions.
   Mrs. Papandreou, 65, who runs a socialist feminist organization
in Greece, has not visited her husband in the hospital.
   She has not made any public statement on the divorce, and said
in a letter to an English-language Athens newspaper over the past
weekend, ``I will not do so until the health of Andreas is
assured.''
   The couple married in a civil ceremony in the United States in
1951, when Papandreou was an economics professor at the University
of Minnesota. Both had recently divorced.
   When Papandreou's relationship with Ms. Liani became public
knowledge a year ago, Mrs Papandreou said she did not intend to
seek a divorce.
   Ms. Liani, who studied at the Sorbonne University in Paris and
works for Olympic Airways, the Greek state carrier, met the premier
through his wife in 1986, and later was assigned to his official
plane.
   At that time, Mrs. Papandreou was seeking better media promotion
for feminism in Greece and chose Ms. Liani to host a Greek
television talk show on sexual equality called ``Miso-Miso'' (Half
and Half). The premier was one of the first guests interviewed by
Ms. Liani.
   Ms. Liani is divorcing her husband, Alexis Kapopoulos, 48, an
architect who works for state-run television.
   The Papandreous have four children and two grandchildren. Their
marriage has weathered difficulties in the past, but this time the
premier's attitude has markedly changed, as Greek commentators
pointed out.
   ``In the past, when a serious love affair produced his
(Papandreou's) child, the issue of his marriage never surfaced,''
Helen Vlachos wrote Sunday in her column in the Athens daily
Kathimerini.
   ``But he seems to have lost a sense of reality ... he acts as
though he's overlooked one detail: that he is the premier of
Greece,'' she wrote.
   She was referring to Papandreou's illegitimate daughter, born
after an affair he had with a Swedish actress while his family was
exiled in Stockholm during the 1967-74 military dictatorship that
ruled Greece.
   That affair was revealed a few days before a general election in
June 1985 in which Papandreou was re-elected by a comfortable
majority.
   Papandreou's meeting with his 18-year-old daughter Emilia Nyblom
at the end of an official visit to Sweden in January was widely
reported in Greek newspapers, but opinion polls showed no related
decline in his popularity.
   According to political pollster Panayote Dimitras, the lack of
electoral reaction is due to the fact that ``to many Greeks,
Papandreou and the other politicians are like Hollywood actors, so
you don't expect them to be perfect, and you certainly don't judge
them by your own domestic standards.''
