   Actress Elizabeth Taylor,
hospitalized three weeks with pneumonia, had a good weekend and has
started poring over the thousands of cards and letters from
well-wishers, her publicist said Monday.
   ``She's doing fine,'' spokeswoman Chen Sam said.
   Miss Taylor, 58, who was reported near death the previous
weekend, was moved Thursday to a private room after an 10-day stay
in intensive care at St. Johns Hospital and Health Center.
   Doctors gave no indication when Miss Taylor could leave the
hospital and continue recuperating at her Beverly Hills home, Ms.
Sam said.
   The Oscar-winning star has started to read messages from
well-wishers.
   ``She's beginning to look at some of them, but the doctors are
concerned that she get a lot of rest,'' Ms. Sam said. ``There is an
unbelievable amount of interest. They (cards and letters) are
coming in the masses.''
   Last week, the hospital released a statement on Miss Taylor's
behalf thanking fans and friends for their cards and letters during
her hospitalization.

   Oprah Winfrey isn't ready for marriage _ and
she should know.
   ``I've done so many shows about marriage and divorce and
relationships that have failed,'' the host of her own syndicated
talk show said in this week's TV Guide. ``I know it would be
foolish to think you can have it all in one time.
   ``I think you can have it all. You just can't have it all at
once.''
   Not that Winfrey is unhappy with her beau, Stedman Graham.
   ``I can't imagine or think of _ nor have I seen or experienced _
anybody who would be more ideal for me,'' she said.
   But marriage, she said, is ``a whole different responsibility
that I can't handle right now. Now, I feel like he has his life, I
have my life. It's fine just like it is.''

   Eileen Fulton, who plays that nasty,
oft-married character Lisa Mitchell on the CBS soap opera ``As the
World Turns,'' had a special clause put in her contract in the
1970s.
   Fulton, a 30-year veteran of the show, inserted a ``granny
clause'' that kept her television son, Tom, from having children.
   ``Soap opera grandmothers had periwinkle-blue hair, wore support
hose and listened to everybody else's problems. I was not about to
find myself in that category,'' Fulton said in this week's TV Guide.
   Fulton, 56, enjoys her star status and popularity.
   ``I've always maintained a standard of glamour because I'm sick
of actors who gripe about how hard they work and disappoint the
very people who love them,'' she told the magazine.

   Soviet ballerina Natalia Makarova and her
husband have their 18th-century violins back, including the
Stradivarius that was snatched in a daring burglary at their house.
   Police on Sunday evening arrested Robert Fisher, 27, of San
Francisco. He was scheduled for arraignment.
   The recovered Stradivarius was worth more than $1 million. The
other violin, a Guarnerius, was valued at about $1 million, police
spokesman David Ambrose said.
   The violins, jewelry and a pair of Chinese enameled statuettes
were among items stolen Saturday from the home of Makarova and her
husband, Edward Karkar. Makarova, 49, recently retired from the
American Ballet Theatre.
   The couple's 1986 Mercedes-Benz also was stolen. Police said
Fisher was arrested as he walked away from the car after parking it
about a mile from the house. Most of the stolen items were in the
car, Ambrose said.
   ``Obviously, he didn't realize what he had taken. For that we
can be thankful,'' said Karkar. The violins are his, and he said he
practices on them regularly.
   Stradivarius violins, made by the Italian craftsman Antonio
Stradivari and his sons, are generally considered the finest in the
world. Guarnerius violins, made during the same period by the
Guarneri family, are also highly prized.
