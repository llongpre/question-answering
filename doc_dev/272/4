<P>
A respected politician who began an otherwise honorable career by cashing in on 
an insider trading scam is about to be found out. An unscrupulous woman tries 
to use this information to blackmail him into falsifying a report before the 
government. A career, a marriage and the possible public financing of a canal 
that should never be built all hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "An Ideal Husband" so remarkable is that Oscar Wilde was writing 
about the turn of the last century, not this one, in this rarely seen show, now 
in a sparkling gem of a production at Lamb's Players Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Under the crisp and sensitive direction of Kerry Cederberg Meads, the very 
talented Lamb's Theatre ensemble quickly shows us that, although the men may be 
wearing proper British topcoats and the women flashing parasols, the flawed and 
yearning hearts that beat beneath the finery are very much like our own. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the play is emblematic of everything that Lamb's does best: tightknit 
ensemble work by a core resident cast and a musical ability to provide riffs on 
a theme that pursues ethical questions -- all without a trace of 
heavy-handedness. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the most fascinating of the characters, the conniving blackmailer, Lady 
Cheveley, is brilliantly played by Deborah Gilmour Smyth to show the human side 
of this monster. It is not just her greed but her jealousy of her former 
goody-goody schoolmate, Gertrude, that inspires her plan. Gertrude is married 
to Robert Chiltern, Gertrude's match in morality -- except, of course, for that 
insider trading scam that Gertrude does not happen to know about until Lady 
Cheveley has the pleasure of throwing it in her face. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Smyth oils her way across the floor, coquettishly looking up from 
lowered eyelids, smiling her enigmatically knowing Mona Lisa smiles, weaving 
conversational webs like a veritable spider that her prey sticks to like so 
many helpless flies, she has her points of vulnerability. She nearly breaks 
down when she is repulsed by the man she wants; one believes her when she says, 
from her perspective, that all these maneuverings are a business deal to her, 
nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Lady Cheveley and Robert Chiltern had the same mentor, a Baron 
who taught Chiltern to subscribe to what Chiltern calls "the philosophy of 
power, the gospel of gold." Now, although Lady Cheveley still believes, 
Chiltern has internalized his wife's uncompromisingly moral philosophy. His 
dilemma comes when he has to decide whether to sell out to the blackmail and 
support the building of a canal he knows is wrong to save himself, or whether 
to risk ruin by sticking to what he believes is right. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Buckley's elegant, spare sets, nicely complemented by Alan Will's 
lighting, are much assisted by a clever routine in which two servants (Smith 
and Sonja Anderson) do the tidying up, with one hurrying along the other, who 
has a weakness for gazing at herself in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Reith's costumes are a pleasure of billowing fabric, feathers and lace, 
and the uncredited sound design captures the elegance of the mood. 
</P>
<P>
But the star of the piece is the genius of Wilde; aside from the famous wit ("I 
love to talk about nothing; it's the only thing I know anything about"), one 
hears lines of depth that predate masterpieces by later writers. When Wilde 
equates "the horror" with Gertrude Chiltern's fervent but mistaken belief in 
her husband's innocence ("I was sure of it. I was sure," she says), one hears a 
foreshadowing of the words Joseph Conrad would use in writing about the fiancee 
who lied to herself about her betrothed in "The Heart of Darkness." 
</P>
<P>
When the impassioned Robert Chiltern, defending himself before his outraged 
wife, argues that it is not the perfect people in this world who need love, but 
the imperfect, one can anticipate the impassioned speech Lorraine Hansberry was 
to write for Mama in "A Raisin in the Sun," when she argues that people are 
deserving of love when they are fallen and need it the most. 
</P>
<P>
If "An Ideal Husband" does have a fault, it ties up the ends too neatly, much 
unlike the way most situations resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not a lot has changed. The insider scandals continue. Prejudice 
continues. We continue to worship power and money and expect an unrealistic 
perfection of those who have acquired this power and money. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps we are more ready to hear Wilde's pleas for love and charity than 
the society in his time was. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly is difficult to resist his arguments in this irresistible play. 
</P>
