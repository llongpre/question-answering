   Tammy Wynette's life has had as many turmoils as
a country music song lyric.
   She's had five marriages; her daughter, Tina, had meningitis as
an infant; she's had medical and painkiller-dependency problems;
her house burned; 256 hours of tapes for her autobiography burned
in another fire; and she filed for bankruptcy last fall.
   A settlement was made in March, the bankruptcy is withdrawn and
she's able now to explain about protecting herself with chapter 11.
   But Wynette isn't trying to change her image as the country
queen of hurt and lonely. ``It's often said I spoke for the wronged
woman,'' she says.
   Her current single, ``Thank the Cowboy for the Ride,'' is
cheerful. She is healthy and has been happily married, since 1978,
to George Richey, who manages her career. They met 22 years ago,
when he was writing songs for her with record producer Billy
Sherrill, who gave her the stage name Tammy to go with her middle
name Wynette. She was born Virginia Wynette Pugh.
   ``I think that's one reason our marriage has been good and
lasted,'' Wynette says. ``We were buddies first. We worked well
together. We could talk.
   ``When Richey and I got married, Billy Sherrill said, `There
will be no more sad songs written.' He was right.''
   But she can still sing sad songs. ``I remember how I felt when I
wrote the song or what was happening in my life when I first heard
it and recorded it. I couldn't get the feeling across to them (the
audience) if I didn't go back and put myself in that position.''
   She and Richey wrote only one song on her new album, ``When a
Girl Becomes a Wife,'' for her youngest daughter, Georgette, who
was married in March in Red Bay, Ala. Her older daughters are Gwen,
Jackie and Tina, who was married last year.
   Wynette's new album, ``Next to You,'' her 51st for CBS, does
contain some heartbroken and wronged-woman songs, such as ``You
Left Memories Layin' (All Over the Place)'' and ``Liar's Roses.''
   ``A sad song makes you reflect back on something in your life
that has happened. You can feel part of that song,'' she said.
   She was interviewed while in New York for her first appearance
at the Bottom Line. Wynette is on a national tour these days. She
tours 11 months a year in the United States and Europe, and takes
off three weeks in December. ``I've got a beautiful house in
Nashville and I live on a bus.''
   The blond singer seems to glow with health. ``It feels good to
feel good,'' she said. ``I haven't had any problems since surgery
2{ years ago. I had one operation and formed adhesions, which
caused the rest of the operations. I'm one of those people who form
scar tissue.''
   About filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, protection against
creditors, Wynette said she and her husband had money in the
development of two Florida shopping centers. The first sold and all
went well. When the second sold, she said, the money was dispersed
to the other partners and her bank credit wasn't paid off.
   ``They sent a federal marshal to our house. They were going to
take everything we had and we didn't owe the money,'' she said.
   ``I think they thought we wouldn't want my name dragged through
fighting that. Whether they dragged my name through mud or not, we
had to do it. They wanted $1.2 million. If you don't owe it, why
pay it? We'd worked too hard to have what we had to let somebody
take it. We made a settlement of $450,000 in November and didn't
get the paperwork done until March 9. We paid them and they're out
of our life now.''
   Richey said three bankers were indicted in the case.
   ``We couldn't explain this while we were in litigation,''
Wynette said. ``I had to just say, yes, I'd filed for bankruptcy.
It was horrible to have to go through it. You don't think people
will do that to you. It's over with. That's all that matters now.''
   Paul Richey, her husband's brother, and Ed Bruce, who wrote
``Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,'' wrote the
current single, ``Thank the Cowboy for the Ride.''
   ``It's a cute little song,'' Wynette said. ``It starts, `He was
pushing 7 and I was barely 5, when he rode up on his broomstick
horse and said, ``You want a ride?'' It goes on, `He's almost 67; I
admit to 39.' When I've done it on stage, old and young people love
it.''
   Her favorite song written with her husband is ``Till I Can Make
It on My Own.''
   ``George Jones and I had just divorced. The song said exactly
what I was living.'' She and Jones worked together after the
divorce but stopped that several years ago.
   ``He's happy. I'm happy. Our daughter is happy. We had magic
years ago. To try and go back and recapture that would probably be
a mistake. It's probably best we leave it like it is.''
