   Galina is tired of Russian men who expect her to
do all the cooking and shopping, plus work a full-time job. She has
an idea that with an American man, ``things might be a bit more
equal.''
   So she sent three photographs and an application to Nakhodka, or
Godsend, the first ``mail-order bride'' service matching Soviet
women with North American men.
   ``Of course, if I met a very sweet American man, I would be
willing to cook and clean for him, too,'' Galina, 36, explained in
an interview. ``But at least I would be living in America.''
   The lure of love in a land of prosperity has hooked many Soviet
women this year. More than 1,500 have paid 50 rubles (about 880)
apiece to join Godsend since it was founded eight months ago.
   The company is part of a new Soviet bride industry that includes
an Italian marriage service, an international video introduction
firm and half-a-dozen magazines packed with personal ads.
   Behind the industry are two recent phenomena: President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's political reforms, which have made it easier to
meet, marry and move abroad with foreigners; and the worsening
Soviet economy, which has cut into the quality of many women's
lives and set them to dreaming about life in the West.
   ``Soviet women have a lot more respect for American men than for
Soviet men,'' said Sergei Kurochkin, 39, a former computer software
designer who founded Godsend last April.
   ``They say Soviet men are lazy, unfaithful and rude. They want
someone who will hold doors open for them.''
   Again and again, those sentiments are reflected in the seductive
short letters that women who join Godsend write about themselves.
   ``I'm kind and sensitive and I want to marry a gentleman,''
wrote Maria. ``I want to look after him.''
   ``For me, the ideal husband is an American man,'' wrote Galya,
28. ``I would like someone 30-35 years old, intelligent, who ...
wants to start a family on the basis of mutual respect, tenderness
and love.''
   Many letters also brim with frustration over the competing
demands of working full-time, shopping and keeping a home.
Kurochkin said the choice of most Soviet women is clear: ``They
love their homes. They want to be in their kitchens.''
   For $25, an American man can receive a packet of a dozen such
letters and photographs from a Los Angeles-based agency called
American-Russian Matchmaking.
   After corresponding by mail, the would-be American groom can
arrange through Godsend to come to the Soviet Union for 10 days to
meet his prospective mate, a trip that costs between $1,500 and
$4,000.
   If he ends up marrying one of the women, the price rises even
more: by contract, he's obligated to pay the matchmakers $3,000.
   Still, there seems to be plenty of interest. After the U.S. Army
magazine Stars and Stripes published a picture of some of the
women, it got phone calls from U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia,
asking for the matchmaking firm's address.
   Kurochkin said he's still working out the bugs in his system.
Originally, he offered to link American women with Soviet men, but
found little demand and dropped the service. Some Soviet men shake
their heads at their American counterparts who change diapers and
share household chores.
   Recently, Kurochkin began requiring Soviet women to say whether
they smoke, because bean-sprout-and-whole-wheat types from
California were appalled to be matched with chain-smokers.
   So far, no marriages have resulted from Godsend's efforts.
Kurochkin said the first may be in late January or early February,
when a Soviet woman plans to fly to the United States to join an
American man she met through the agency in November.
