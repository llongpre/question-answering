   Matt Fisher is the family risk taker, known to delay paying the
electric bill until the ``disconnect notice'' comes, while his wife
Barbara is a virtuoso at balancing the checkbook.
   Fisher, 34, feels reasonably comfortable with things like
corporate bonds or growth stocks. Mrs. Fisher, 42, gets uneasy at
the mention of those words.
   Still, the Jacksonville, Fla., couple, who recently opened a
hair-replacement business, mix love and money successfully. They
keep half their $200,000 investment portfolio in stocks and bonds
and the rest in short-term certificates of deposit or money market
accounts. Neither makes an investment decision without the other,
they say.
   For every couple like the Fishers, however, there are several
more that fail to jointly plan or even discuss important personal
financial matters. Experts say part of the problem is that a large
number of women have been slow in gaining equality in the home when
it comes to money.
   Even though women have emerged from the Money Decade of the '80s
as the fastest growing part of the work force, their role in
shaping the family's financial future remains stuck in a bygone
world, some investment planners say.
   ``Women are still in a very transitional role in which a man
makes the investment decisions,'' said Marilyn Cohen, a principal
of Capital Insight Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif. ``I don't find the
young urban professional woman any more interested in money and
investing than her mother who had a traditional housewife role. I
find it very distressing.''
   Michael Stein, a financial planner with Brownson Rehmus &amp;
Foxworth in Chicago, said he also has encountered apathy in many of
the working women among his married clients, largely comprised of
wealthy, middle-aged executives.
   While the wives may be more likely to manage day-to-day family
finances, like balancing the checkbook and paying household bills,
the husbands usually have the upper hand in making the major
financial decisions, he said.
   ``Often where you have two executive units...the husband still
tends to be the dominant one,'' Stein said. ``A dominating woman is
the exception more than the rule.''
   Not surprisingly, couples' financial concerns vary with age.
Investment counselors say a younger couple likely will be more
concerned with making house payments and accumulating wealth than a
middle-aged pair, which is starting to think about retirement or
paying off a child's college loan.
   Victoria Felton-Collins, a financial planner and psychologist
with offices in California, said money values start between the
ages of 4 and 12. Many Americans, she said, have trouble shedding
the traditional male-female roles ingrained in their past
regardless of economic changes.
   ``Both men and women are, in fact, perpetuating this,'' said
Felton-Collins, who wrote the recently published book ``Couples &amp;
Money.''
   ``I've seen very successful women who go home and turn their
paychecks over to their husbands. They may manage millions of
dollars for their companies but when they get home it's a different
story.''
   That relationship, however, is slowly changing as women continue
to enter the work force and gain greater financial confidence.
Felton-Collins said she expects that to continue through the '90s.
   ``Maybe it's going to take another generation _ the daughters of
these young urban professional women,'' said Cohen.``They see their
working mothers bringing home paychecks.''
   About 60 percent of all women of working age are employed
outside the home, and by the year 2000 women are expected to
comprise about half of the nation's total work force.
   Full-time women workers are making more than they once did and
some nearly bring home as much as their spouses. Still, only one in
six married women working full-time brings home more money than her
husband, a figure that has remained constant for a decade. Census
Bureau figures show that on average, women still only earn about 65
percent of their husband's income.
   Eileen Sharkey, who runs the Denver financial planning service
Sharkey &amp; Associates Inc., said that in her practice she has seen
more women taking an active role in finances over the past 10 years.
   But she said, ``I don't think there's ever going to be equality
in terms of interest. There will always be men who won't give up
the checkbook and women who won't give up tennis ... and the other
way around.''
   Often, it's not until death or divorce that women take a more
active role in their financial future, said Jan Warner, a Columbia,
S.C., lawyer who runs SoloSource Inc., a service that counsels
divorced women on financial options.
   Warner estimates that three-quarters of his female clients, most
of whom are age 40 or older, come to him without the financial
know-how needed to make it alone comfortably.
   ``The average person that comes to us has been the victim of the
demise of a 15-to 20-year-old marriage with no business acumen
because she has relied on someone else to do it,'' he said. ``And
we deal with some pretty good business women.''
   Mary Lynn, 47, a real estate broker from Cleveland, fits into
that category. Recently divorced from her husband of 24 years, she
has crammed to learn enough about investment matters to make it on
her own.
   The woman, who asked not to be identified by her full married
name, said she expected to receive between $50,000 and $60,000 once
the family house is sold. She's looking for investments.
   ``He (the ex-husband) just basically did all the decision making
where money was concerned,'' she said. ``I guess that was one of
the sore spots. He never really asked or consulted me.''
   Stein, the financial planner, said that wives of breadwinners,
no matter how stable their marriages might seem, should try to
garner some financial independence. He suggested they establish
credit and accummulate assets solely in their own name, since their
husbands likely are doing just that through their own company
retirement plans.
   ``Money and the inability to discuss it openly and honestly
causes more damn problems than anything else,'' said Hank Madden, a
financial planner with IDS Financial Services Inc.'s Jacksonville,
Fla., office, who has been advising the Fishers.
   He said the hair-replacement entrepreneurs stand out among his
clients because each would be prepared to make an investment
decision individually. Still, he said, the financial philosophies
of the Fishers appear to reflect some sexual stereotypes.
   Men, for example, are more likely to be risk-takers, while women
tend to be a bit more conservative and accountable.
   ``Barbara is my conscience. She is more frugal,'' Fisher said of
his wife.
   ``I'm concerned with losing money; that's my biggest fear,''
said Mrs. Fisher. ``He has a more in-depth grip on what's
happening. He would come home and tell me about whatever he's
interested in and we would make a decision together.''
