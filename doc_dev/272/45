   Nearly nine of 10 women of childbearing age are
satisfied with their lives, and 83 percent believe they will be
able to meet their life goals, according to a Gallup Poll released
today.
   The poll of 1,000 women ages 18 to 44 found that the most
essential element to career success is confidence, followed by a
supportive husband or partner.
   Among other findings:
   _Satisfaction is closely tied to personal and familial aspects
of women's lives.
   _Women with children consider birth control and child care as
very important elements in career success.
   _Most women believe the ideal age to start a family is in her
early twenties.
   _Though most women believe it is very important to plan the
timing of her first child, half the mothers interviewed said their
first was unplanned.
   The poll, commissioned by the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., which
makes birth-control products, found that 88 percent were either
mostly or very satisifed with their lives.
   Fifty-three percent of married women reported being very
satisfied, compared with 28 percent of unmarried women.
   Thirty-nine percent of married women and 53 percent of unmarried
women said they were mostly satisfied. The poll surveyed 673
married and 327 unmarried women.
   Women with children were more likely to say they are very
satisfied with their lives (46 percent to 39 percent). And 52
percent of those working part time said they were very satisfied,
compared with 41 percent of those working full time and 45 percent
who were not employed.
   Asked whether they had met most of their goals, 64 percent said
yes _ though the numbers were 75 percent for college graduates and
39 percent for those who didn't finish high school. Similarly, 82
percent of those whose household income was $35,000 to $49,999 said
they had met their goals, compared with 42 percent of those with
income under $15,000.
   Though the overall percentage of those who believed they'd
eventually meet their goals was 83 percent, the number was just 57
percent for those without a high school diploma.
   The poll found 75 percent believed it was essential to have
confidence to be successful at a job.
   Other elements considered important were a supportive husband or
partner (listed by 66 percent), affordable child care (64 percent),
effective birth control (58 percent), excellent health (51 percent)
and a college education (45 percent).
   Fifty-one percent said the ideal age for a woman to start a
family is from ages 21 to 25. Thirty percent said 26 to 30 is the
best age. Six percent said younger than 21 and 3 percent said older
than 30.
   Sixty-three percent said it is very important to plan when to
have the first child, though 48 percent said their first child was
unplanned and 51 percent said it was.
   The random poll was conducted by phone June 17-21 and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
