<LEADPARA>  'I AM not And Guest," exclaimed a lady of longstanding respectability.;   
"I'm the man's wife. We've been married for 40 years, and they all know it. So
why can't my husband's office invite us as 'Mr. and Mrs.'? It's always 'Mr. --
and Guest,' even from people we see all the time.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Are they afraid the marriage isn't going to last another two weeks until
the party? And that he'll be furious they didn't anticipate his bringing
someone he's picked up since?";    "I refuse to be anybody's Domestic
Partner," roared a redoubtable gentleman. "Quaint as it may seem, my wife and
I happen to be married. The last time I checked, that made me her husband. I
may have had to learn to help with the housework in ways I didn't anticipate
when I made the arrangement, but by God, that's still not my primary function
in this union.";    No, we're just married;  "What should I have said?" asked
a bewildered matron. "A lady I met at a party asked me if I were 'involved'
with one of the men there. I suppose I made a fool of myself, because I
blurted out, 'Oh, no, we're married, and we have three grown-up children.' "; 
  Miss Manners understands that these sputterings can be seen to be the dated
protests of people who are used to having lives rather than lifestyles.;   
She could explain to the married that the more general terms -- guest,
partner, involvement -- are used nowadays to include the comparatively recent
social acceptance of couples who, while not legally married, have gone public
and expect to be treated as a social unit. Those who use these terms, rather
than those exclusively reserved for the married, hope that by doing so they
will offend fewer people.;    ID's optional;  And after all, the hosts are not
interested in checking licenses to see who is attending a party with whom. As
a matron of Miss Manners' acquaintance was told when she explained that her
husband was out of town but that she would like to bring her brother, "You can
bring anyone you like, and you can call him whatever you like.";    Miss
Manners could also point out that people are understandably wary of making
presumptions about any sort of couplings. The polite inquiry "How's the
family?" may set off all kinds of emotional explosions in those who have
dissolved their families since the last inquiry.;    Still, Miss Manners
sympathizes when indignation is exhibited by ordinary people who see their
conventional arrangements treated as special cases. There is something not
quite nice about the assumption that married people are exceptions to the
rule, and that marriages are so fragile that anyone who hasn't checked in the
last week should not treat one as being intact.;    It leads to the chilling
terminology now ubiquitous among the young who are embarking upon marriage.
"This is a first wedding," today's blushing bride will confess. "It's the
first marriage for both of us," the bridegroom will say manfully.;    "Oh,"
one feels like replying, "only the first time. Well, come back and tell me
when you're getting married for the final time.";    The proper phrasing, you
idealistic young things, is "We're getting married." The event is referred to
as "our wedding," without a number being put on it.;    And the proper term
for a guest is that person's name. If you don't know whether the person you
intend to invite is married, you must ask; and you could use the opportunity
to find out if the couple uses "Mr. and Mrs." or other honorifics, and the
same or different surnames. If you intend a person to bring someone else, you
must ask that person's name.;    Dignity demands that wives and husbands be
acknowledged as such, aside from whatever other terms are used for other
pairings. And there is no dignity at all in anyone's being addressed as "and
guest" or "escort."; DEAR MISS MANNERS -- My son is planning to become engaged
to a wonderful girl who has had a strict upbringing and has only recently
broken away from a matriarch-mother. She is aware of this, and has been
friendly and sociable.;    My son asked if it would help matters if he would
first mention the engagement to the mother (the girl's father has died) to let
her feel she is part of their plans.;    Or is that never done with
engagements, since they are a private happy time for the two involved? Is it
still proper and considerate for my son to ask the mother for her daughter's
hand and for her blessing on the marriage? He wants to do the right thing to
continue gaining the mother's approval.;    GENTLE READER -- Your son has
charming instincts, and Miss Manners has only small adjustments to suggest to
him.;    Even in stricter times, a gentleman interested in a romantic match --
as opposed to making a business deal with a lady's family and depending on
them to extract her compliance -- always made sure of the lady before
approaching her family.;    And in this case, your hint about mother-daughter
friction makes it seem wise first to make sure of her feelings about his idea,
as well as her feelings about him.;    The proper order is therefore:;    1.
Ask young lady for her hand in marriage.;    2. Ask young lady for permission
to ask her mother for her hand in marriage.;    3. Ask mother.  </TEXT>
