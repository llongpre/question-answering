   The title character in ``Imagining Brad'' has no
arms, no legs, almost no hair, cauliflower ears and flaky, crusty
skin that makes him look, in the words of his wife's good friend,
like ``a Christmas cookie.''
   These are some of the qualities that make Brad an ideal husband,
according to Peter Hedges' dark comedy that the Circle Repertory
Company brought to off-Broadway's Players Theater on Tuesday night.
But as the centerpiece of Hedges' blessedly short, 80-minute play,
Brad, who is neither seen nor heard, makes for less than riveting
dramatic material.
   The comedy, a bleak meditation on marriage, is absurd without
being insightful. The characters are long on weirdness, short on
sympathy. Much of the play consists of tedious, unenlightening
conversations between Brad's wife _ she is never identified by name
_ and Dana Sue, her new best friend.
   In church, at bars, even driving around town, the two women
discuss their men. Dana Sue can't speak highly enough of her
husband, whom she describes as handsome and a good lover. It's only
later in the evening that the audience discovers that he is a
violent man.
   But Brad's wife is content with her mate. Their relationship is
a happy one, even if it only consists of her singing songs to her
bedridden husband. The woman even suggests that Dana Sue ditch her
husband for a man like Brad. There are a lot of them out there, she
confides. Better a vegetable than a wifebeater, Hedges seems to be
saying.
   The play includes a prologue, a long speech by a girl named
Valerie who grows up to be Brad's wife. It's her birthday, but she
spends most of the time talking about her first menstrual cycle _
either on the phone to her girlfriends or holding a mock news
conference about it.
   Director Joe Mantello allows the charming Melissa Joan Hart, who
plays the the teen-age Valerie, to rush through her monologue,
making some of it unintelligible. Sharon Ernster gives a good ol'
girl performance, complete with honey-dipped Southern accent, as
Dana Sue, while Erin Cressida Wilson displays an earnest looniness
that lends Brad's wife some credibility.
   But the play isn't funny enough to be a comedy, no matter how
outrageous its situations, or compelling enough to be a good drama.
Like its inert hero, ``Imagining Brad'' just lies there.
