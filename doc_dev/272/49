   Vivian Filemyr's health is frail and money is
tight, so when the government suddenly slashed her share of her
ex-husband's military pension, she had to plead with doctors and
creditors to accept less than usual when bills came due.
   The 66-year-old Austin woman says her main source of income was
cut without warning in May, from about $1,100 a month to $900, and
she's spent the last two months trying to find out why.
   She thinks the cut came because her es-husband, a retired
colonel, may have incurred a debt to the government many years
after their 1972 divorce.
   The military won't say more, she said, because it would be an
invasion of his privacy.
   ``My credit rating is being hurt; I have to call my creditors
and say my check is reduced and I don't know why and I can't pay
you,'' Ms. Filemyr said.
   Congressional officials and members of an ex-wives support group
in Alexandria, Va., say Ms. Filemyr's case is not unique and may
illustrate a growing trend as the government cracks down on its bad
debts.
   ``The government _ they'll get their money any way they can,''
said Shirley Taft, former president of EX-POSE, or Ex-Partners of
Servicemen-women for Equality.
   ``We've heard from quite a few (women) and it's quite
devastating. They don't even know why it's being reduced and the
finance centers won't tell them. They only know the man's gone into
debt for something,'' Ms. Taft said.
   She said representatives of the group met with Pentagon
officials earlier this month to argue that the ex-wives should not
be held liable for debts incurred by their former spouses after the
divorce is final.
   But the Pentagon told the group ``chances of an administrative
change are very slim,'' she said.
   Congressional hearings on the matter and other related issues
are planned in September before a subcommittee of the House Armed
Services Committee, says a spokeswoman for Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo., who sponsored the 1982 Former Spouse Protection Act.
   Under the bill, courts can award a portion of a serviceman's
retirement check to the former spouse. If the couple were married
at least 10 years, the ex-wife can receive the money directly
through the military's finance centers, Ms. Taft said.
   Maj. David Super, Pentagon spokesman, said the military is
looking into the situation but continues to ``operate with existing
administrative rules and laws.''
   Ms. Taft said her organization plans to poll its 3,500 members
about the problem this month.
   ``This is not an isolated case,'' Ms. Filemyr wrote in a letter
to Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Texas. ``I have spoken with various women
across the country who have related to me that they are in the same
situation.''
   Mrs. Filemyr said she was divorced after 25 years of marriage
and was on welfare for years as she fought for the 1982 law.
   ``I only had a little job here, a little job there, and I kept
getting sicker,'' she said. ``I've had it rough, yes I've had it
rough. Her only other source of income is a monthly Social Security
check of about $160, she said.
   Rep. Schroeder's spokeswoman said the congresswoman plans to
introduce legislation that would divide retirement pay according to
a formula based on the number of years of service and the length of
the marriage, rather than leaving the decision to individual courts
or states.
