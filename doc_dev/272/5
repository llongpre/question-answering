   Charlotte Fedders ushers a guest from the
cluttered kitchen of her suburban Washington home to the sunny
living room filled with photographs of her children.
   A cat snuggling on the couch is quickly shooed away and Mrs.
Fedders begins to describe in even tones the physical and mental
abuse inflicted by her husband, the former top chief of enforcement
at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   She speaks about the violence during her 18-year marriage, the
legal battles with her ex-husband John Fedders, the resiliency of
her five sons and her own inner strength. She pauses to deal with a
question from son Peter, who has padded downstairs in bare feet to
ask, ``Do elephants have tails?''
   Five years ago, a messy kitchen, cat hairs in the living room
and a sudden display of precociousness would have been verboten. In
her book, ``Shattered Dreams,'' Charlotte Fedders described her
husband's weekly white-glove inspections, in which he ran his
fingers along tops of doors and windows, and how he liked to see
the vacuum marks in the carpet all going the same way.
   As the result of her experience, Charlotte Fedders has become
one of the nation's best-known victims of spouse abuse. She speaks
out on the issue around the country and in return receiving
thousands of letters filled with words of encouragement and
personal tales of domestic violence.
   ``I have folders of letters that I can't respond to,'' she says.
``They pour their hearts out to me. There's enormous support.
   ``They say I've done just what I had to do. I had no other
choice.''
   At one time, the Fedders family gave the appearance of an ideal
existence _ wealthy suburban home, exclusive country club
membership, private schools, powerful Washington job.
   But a dirty secret festered inside the six-bedroom, beige brick
house in Potomac, Md.: John Fedders beat his wife.
   ``We had been talking for a while. All I remember is that this
conversation seemed to be going well. That we were really
conversing, sharing ideas. We were not fighting, we were not being
sarcastic or nasty. I swear we were just talking,'' Charlotte
Fedders wrote in her book, referring to the first time her husband
struck her in 1968.
   ``But I think it was the first time I disagreed with him and was
sticking to my guns. I was arguing my point calmly, but I was
holding to it. ... It was one good sock to the left side of my ear.
Then I heard this ringing sound. I found out later that he had
broken my eardrum.''
   In court testimony during the February 1985 divorce trial,
Charlotte Fedders described seven violent incidents that occurred
during her marriage, including the time her husband struck her
while she was four months pregnant with their first child.
   ``He loomed over me and hit me in the abdomen, three, maybe five
times, hard. I bent over, trying to protect my tummy. They were
powerful blows. It felt like taking a heavy fall. ... I tried to
push him away, which only seemd to make him madder. He yelled that
he didn't care if he killed me or the baby,'' she wrote in her book.
   Among those present in the courtroom during the divorce
proceedings was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, whose
article of Feb. 25 on John Fedders' problems touched off a furor
that forced Fedders to resign his SEC post late the next day.
   In his resignation letter to then SEC Chairman John Shad,
Fedders said, ``On seven occasions during more than 18 years of
marriage, marital disputes between us resulted in violence for
which I feel and have expressed great remorse.''
   ``These isolated events do not, however, justify the extreme
characterizations made in the press,'' he said.
   Fedders did not respond to several telephone calls seeking his
comments on his former wife's charges.
   The ideal family was no more, but the legal battles continued.
After John Fedders testified, he pleaded with the court to give him
time to work out a reconciliation with his wife. Montgomery County
Circuit Court Judge James S. McAuliffe suggested that the couple go
out to dinner and try to talk things out.
   ``That was a devastating moment,'' Charlotte Fedders said in a
recent interview, recalling the 5-year-old incident. ``He thought
it was the right thing for the kids-slash-me. John had promised
never to do it again. The judge showed a total lack of
understanding of domestic violence.''
   In 1987, a Circuit Court domestics relations official, John S.
McInerney, reduced John Fedders' alimony payments from $750 a month
to $500. McInerney also awarded Fedders a 25 percent share of the
proceeds from his wife's book, saying she shared the blame for his
violent outbursts because she withheld emotional support during his
depression.
   ``He obviously ruled very poorly. ... He doesn't know what's
going on,'' she said.
   Judge McAuliffe in February of this year reversed McInerney's
action, ruling that Fedders could not share in the profits from his
wife's book, but his decision was based on the belief that no exact
monetary value can be placed on a book. McAuliffe said it cannot be
considered a marital asset.
   The judge also reduced John Fedders' alimony payments to $400 a
month. Fedders had asked the court to end the payments, saying the
publicity had hurt his earning capacity by damaging his once
successful legal career.
   ``This particular judge made the final ruling and I did as well
as I could do,'' Charlotte Fedders said. ``He didn't understand
that John was manipulating the system, manipulating lives.
   ``There isn't a soul who doesn't think John Fedders couldn't be
doing well _ in a small way John won. The judge bought John's
truth.''
   For Charlotte Fedders, the product of a strict Roman Catholic
education and a family dominated by a strong father, her lone
desire was the realization of an old-fashioned dream.
   ``All I ever wanted to be was a wife and mother,'' she wrote in
her book. ``To marry a man who could give me children and a
comfortable life, filled with love and little strife. ... So
finding that man was very important.''
