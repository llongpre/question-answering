<F P=106> [By Chen Pingjun: "Marriages Threatened by Rise in Divorce </F>
Rate"] 
  [Text] The love which is shared in over 95 percent of 
Beijing marriages is being endangered by domestic violence and 
rising divorce rates. 
  Divorce rates hit an estimated 19 percent last year. 
  And one in five husbands beat up their wives, according to 
the Beijing Society of Research on Marriage and Family. 
  However, home is where the heart is and more than 90 percent 
of married couples said they were basically happy with each 
other. 
  The city-wide survey of more than 2,100 families also 
revealed that by and large Chinese husbands take the lead when 
it comes to sex and leave the household chores to their wives. 
  Divorce rates in Beijing have climbed from 15.2 percent in 
1990. 
  They went up to 16.5 percent in 1991, 17.7 percent in 1992 
and about 19 percent in 1993, according to the society. 
  Violence in the home wasn't just limited to the male of the 
species. Over 15 percent of wives beat up their husbands, 
according to the survey, which was led by Li Yinhe of the 
Sociology Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 
  But women's leader, Shang Languo, said that male victims of 
domestic violence could not be compared with battered wives. 
  "For the women it may be self defence. The wife has to fight 
back when being attacked by her husband," said Shang, deputy 
director of the Women's Rights Protection Department. "And then 
there's the question of physical differences, women are usually 
smaller than men, battered husbands will probably suffer less 
than abused wives," said domestic violence expert Shang, who 
works under the auspices of Beijing's Women's Federation. 
  The survey revealed that 1 percent of husbands beat their 
wives very often. 
  Most of the violence was reported in the homes of 
ill-educated, working class, young couples, according to Li 
Yinhe. 
  Beijingers generally regard men and women as equals in the 
home, the survey said. 
  More than 80 percent of spouses believe they enjoy equal 
relations with their mates. 
  And when it comes to sex inequality, it is women who rule 
the 
roost, with almost 10 percent of husbands reporting domineering 
wives. 
  The husbands still take the lead in bed, only 3.2 percent of 
wives initiate sex, the survey found. 
  And actions speak louder than words, perhaps, for 88 percent 
of respondents said it was acceptable for female mates to ask 
for sex. 
  Wives who take charge or have a say in sex are generally 
from 
the younger generation born after 1950. 
  But, despite all the marital problems revealed by the 
survey, 
Li said that most modern marriages in the city are good. 
  Spouses from 92 percent of homes are thoughtful and 
understanding towards each other, said Li, a permanent director 
at the family research society.
