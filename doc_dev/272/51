<HEAD>Husband's Death Changed Joyce Brothers' Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychologist Joyce Brothers says the death of her
husband has left her better able to understand the pain of others.
   Brothers said in this week's People magazine that after the death
of her husband, Milton, last year to cancer she realized that no one
lives without pain.
   ``My pain just came a little farther down the pike than a lot of
people's,'' she wrote. ``It's one thing to read research and discuss
the findings. It's another thing to be able to understand another
person's pain emotionally. I'm a changed person; I'm much more
sensitive to others.''
   Brothers wrote that she misses the laughter she and her husband
shared in their 39 years of marriage.
   ``You miss that more than anything else. Sex is not something you
miss. What you miss is the person who, with all his problems, warts
and difficulties, thinks you're the greatest person in the world.''
   Brothers, 60, said that the only good thing about her husband's
illness was that it allowed her enough time to say goodbye.
   ``You have a chance to say everything in your heart, to leave
nothing unresolved,'' she wrote.
   On the night before he died, she went to the hospital and spoke
to him about their marriage highlights.
   She said she considered suicide by driving her husband's Porsche
into an embankment.
   ``At that moment, I understood what it meant to feel like nothing
made a difference. ... I didn't break down at the funeral. But at
home, I cry. I open my husband's closet; his smell is everywhere,''
she said.
