<LEADPARA>  The trial of Elisabeth Broderick plays more like a high-society divorce than a
murder case: An illicit affair. A spurned wife. A custody battle. Threats.
Greed.;   But one person is missing from the courtroom drama: Daniel Broderick
III, the ex-husband Elisabeth Broderick says she shot after he inflicted years
of psychological abuse.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MURDER TRIAL: ABUSED WIFE OR COLD-BLOODED KILLER?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Broderick killed her 44-year-old ex-husband and his second wife, Linda
Kolkena Broderick, 28, in November 1989, firing five shots toward the couple's
bed before dawn on a Sunday.;   Defense attorney Jack Earley said the shooting
was an unplanned moment of violence sparked by years of psychological attacks
her ex-husband, a wealthy lawyer, piled on his wife through manipulation of
the legal system.;   'Cold-blooded execution';   Prosecutors in the case,
Broderick's second trial in the slayings, have labeled the shooting a
"cold-blooded execution" by a vindictive wife who never got over the loss of
her husband to a younger woman.;   They said it was Broderick, not her
husband, who often behaved cruelly, calling him obscene names, setting his
clothes on fire, smashing her Chevrolet Suburban into the front door of his
house. Several friends testified she had threatened to kill him.;  
Prosecutors plan to seek life in prison without parole if Broderick, 44, is
convicted of murder.;   The unusual "emotional abuse" defense has forced the
prosecution to argue the ex-husband's side in a rehash of four years of bitter
divorce and child-custody battles.;   Testimony on TV;   The sordid details of
a marriage once glamorized on society pages have packed the courtroom with
onlookers and reporters and yielded a book and TV movie.;   A national cable
television audience watched as Broderick tearfully described losing her home,
four children and income after 16 years of once-blissful marriage.;   She said
her ex-husband tried to drive her crazy, first by denying his affair with the
office assistant he later married and then by burying her under an "avalanche"
of legal proceedings, including contempt orders that landed her briefly in
jail.;   "I didn't know what kind of sick jollies they were getting out of
driving me crazy," Broderick testified tearfully. "It was sadistic what they
were doing to me.";   Broderick said she entered the couple's bedroom on Nov.
5, 1989, planning a confrontation to force her ex-husband to stop tormenting
her. She said she squeezed the trigger in a "reflex action" when Linda
Broderick shouted, "Call the police!";   Her first trial ended in a hung jury.
The case is expected to go to another jury this week.;   At the second trial,
defense and prosecution have focused on Broderick's mental state at the time
of the shooting. Both sides say she is sane.;   Broderick testified that the
last legal papers she received from her husband contained his vow not to
relinquish custody of their two sons and a threat to have her thrown in jail.;
  "There was all this darkness and crazy thoughts, you felt like you were in
hell, actually," Broderick said. She said she considered "blowing my brains
out.";   But prosecutors said Broderick passed up several opportunities to
seek custody of her children and that she was receiving $16,000 per month in
support payments when she claims to have been broke. Her husband earned more
than $100,000 per month as a medical malpractice lawyer.;   Deputy District
Attorney Kerry Wells suggested Broderick was embellishing her story. He
countered with $300-per-hour testimony from Dr. Park Elliott Dietz, a
psychiatrist who served as an expert witness in the trial of presidential
assailant John Hinckley.;   Dietz testified that Broderick suffered from
personality disorders that made her egotistical, jealous, thin-skinned and
susceptible to homicidal rage.  </TEXT>
