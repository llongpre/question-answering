<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- The woman from Louisiana who offered her husband to anyone who
would take him described his virtues: a good family man, churchgoing, in
excellent physical condition, who doesn't drink, smoke or gamble. Then she
listed his flaws: mean, selfish, critical, deceitful, miserly, demanding,
rude, vain, inflexible, unforgiving and, she added, "He sucks the joy out of
life on a daily basis." She has stayed with him 40 years.;    Anyone who wants
that man's twin brother can find him in Cleveland. I married him.;    -- Also

<TEXT>     DEAR FED -- I think you're stuck with your husband, dearie. I have at least
12,000 letters on my desk from readers who would like to unload their spouses.
Read on:;    From Dallas: My mate of 30 years presents herself as a dedicated
wife but her real dedication is to her father. He is a tyrant and a hypocrite
who has interfered in our marriage from day one. Sometimes, Ann, it's the
husband who needs to be rescued.;    St. Petersburg: "Louisiana" has a good
many soul sisters. My husband had every fault she mentioned plus a few more.
He died last June, and God forgive me, I sang to myself all the way home from
the cemetery.;    Chicago: "Louisiana" lists her husband's shortcomings but
doesn't say a word about her own. I'll bet her husband has been working his
buns off for 40 years to provide for her. I've met women like that. The best
thing they do is complain.;    Richmond, Va.: This is a letter of gratitude to
"Louisiana." Her letter reminded me that I never thanked you, Ann, for giving
me the courage nine years ago to leave my cheating, lying husband. I never
thought I could make it alone, but you said, "Go for it" -- and I did.;   
Columbus, Ga.: Back in the mid-'70s when so many men were dumping their wives,
I kept praying someone would run off with my husband. I tried dressing him up
and sending him to places where lonely women gathered. An hour later he'd be
back. Too many women settle for a warm body without realizing that with it
comes his laundry, the dishes and a lifetime of boredom.;    Oakland:
"Louisiana" was singing my song. I showed that column to my ex-husband when he
dropped by and as usual, he went into a state of total denial. Nothing is ever
his fault. Praise God, I left him a year ago. Single parenting is hard but it
beats living with a man who is never wrong and makes you feel like nothing.;  
 Tampa: I'll go "Louisiana" one better. She offered to give her husband away.
I will pay $1,000 to any woman who will take mine.;    Concord, Mass.: I wrote
this poem after returning from a funeral where the widow was positively
radiant. Everyone in town knew their marriage had been wretched.;    After
several decades of connubial existence;    His the domination, hers the
non-resistance,;    Fate took a happy and unique direction --;    He did the
dying and she had the resurrection.  </TEXT>
