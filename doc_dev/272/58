   When the wedding is over, the honeymoon is supposed to begin. But
most couples discover that the honeymoon phase doesn't last out the
first year of marriage, says psychotherapist Arlene Modica Matthews.
   The author of ``Why Did I Marry You, Anyway?'' (Houghton Mifflin)
says that some couples panic when they realize they aren't going to
live together without conflict. They shouldn't. ``Negative emotions
are a normal part of living with another human being and `happily
ever after' is a fiction,'' she says.
   The fact that most divorces take place in the first three years
of marriage shows that an unrealistic idealization of marriage can
be harmful.
   ``Any little disappointment makes them think they were wrong.
Since divorce is now socially acceptable, they take the easy way
out. Then they go out and marry the same kind of person again,'' she
says.
   By knowing what to expect and focusing on methods of
communicating in the first year of marriage, couples can resolve
inevitable stresses, which in turn gives the marriage strength to
endure.
   In an interview and in her book, Matthews identified a
three-stage pattern similar to the steps a baby takes along the
pathway to independence.
   In the first stage, each believes the other can fill all
emotional needs. It's soon succeeded by the realization that some of
your needs won't be instantly met: ``You start to think you made a
mistake, that your spouse tricked you.
   ``The third stage is to join the images and realize that your
spouse is an integrated human who has foibles and flaws as well as
wonderful traits. Ideally, you both emerge with a sense of constancy
in which you believe that the marriage will endure in good times and
bad,'' she says.
   ``This generation thinks it is a good idea to be completely open
when you are angry. Fights are healthier than sitting on your
negative feelings for a year and then simply leaving. But you have
to know how to reveal your feelings.
   ``Ask yourself: Is my spouse going to be receptive to hear this
now, and how can I phrase it so he or she will not feel unduly
attacked.
   ``Start your sentences with I _ as in `I feel hurt being ignored
at a party.' Stick with the issue at hand; don't make it a laundry
list of everything that's ever bothered you.''
   She says old-fashioned rules of politeness should not be
abandoned as soon as the wedding finery is taken off. The politeness
of courtship can be continued to a great degree and it is usually a
bad idea to be completely honest all the time.
   Between money and sex, she identified money as the more
troublesome issue. ``Most courting couples have terrific sex lives
but money is a taboo. All of us have learned illogical ways of
dealing with money and, because we are marrying later, we are used
to managing money. Two quirky patterns that are different create a
real problem.''
   Strategies for coping include hiring a financial consultant to
help you de-emotionalize the situation or even separating finances.
Many couples make the mistake of coming together financially without
discussing their differing patterns. She says it may make more sense
to start out separately and come together with more understanding
later on.
   Though sex is less likely to be a bone of contention in these
days of more open discussion, she says that it's normal for the
frequency of activity to decline after marriage.
   No matter what the problem, Matthews says that flexibility
usually helps solve it. ``The people who will adjust best to
marriage are those willing to try new ways of behavior in order to
figure out what they want and how to get it,'' she says.
