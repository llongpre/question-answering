<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- A woman wrote that she was confused and concerned about what she
thought might be her husband's preference for men. She was the mother of a
2-year-old child and had no idea how to handle the situation. I hope my
experience will give her strength because she will need it.;    When I met my
husband, I was bowled over because he was so different from any man I had ever
dated. He behaved like a perfect gentleman during our courtship and never once
made an attempt to get me in bed. His gentleness was charming. I enjoyed his
company and loved being showered with attention.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GAY HUSBAND'S SECRET DID MARRIAGE NO GOOD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     After we married, there was hugging and kissing but no sex. I decided he
was just shy and inexperienced and in time things would change. After several
months when they didn't change, I became extremely frustrated and decided it
was OK to have an affair. Soon after, I found myself with a king-size case of
the guilts. At the time, it didn't dawn on me that my husband was a
homosexual. The thought never entered my mind. In retrospect, I don't know how
I could have been so blind.;    Eventually, I discovered the truth. I stayed
in that marriage six years anyway, thinking I could straighten him out.
Meanwhile I got ulcers and turned bitter. Finally I divorced him.;    We
talked a lot after the papers were served. I wanted him to face the fact that
he had tried to hide behind me in order to hide what he was. Today I seldom
see him, although he lives nearby. I have prayed for him and I want with all
my heart for him to have a good life. He is still a wonderful person, kind and
considerate, but I hope that he doesn't marry again.;    My regrets are few. I
only wish that I had had more knowledge about homosexuality -- and that he had
been more honest with me.; -- Debby in San Bernardino;    DEAR DEBBY --
Welcome to the club. I believe most women who stay married to homosexuals are
convinced that they can straighten them out. Big mistake.; DEAR ANN -- The
woman whose retired husband had nothing to do except interfere with her
cooking needs to hear my story.;    Before Jack and I married, his
ex-girlfriend warned me: "Don't marry Jack. He'll try to run your kitchen and
drive you nuts." Well, I married Jack and for many years while he was busy
teaching chemistry and doing research, he came into my kitchen only when I
asked for his help. He made the world's best gravy. Other than that, I did all
the cooking and marketing.;    Now Jack is retired and claims that cooking is
the ideal outlet for a former chemist. He has taken over my kitchen completely
and even insists on doing the marketing. The man is so creative that we have
wonderful meals every day. What joy! I am now relieved of all cooking duties
and love it.;    -- Happy in Tucson;    DEAR TUCSON -- Lucky girl! I just had
a letter from a woman in Pennsylvania who married a chemist. She mentioned no
gravy, but said he made garbage of her $400,000 inheritance.  </TEXT>
