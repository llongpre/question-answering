<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- I'm writing about "Secret Saver in Conn.," who stashed $35,000
during her 46 years of marriage and is afraid to tell her husband. You told
her, "Money belongs in a bank where it is safe from fire and theft, and can
generate interest.";   Well, Ann, I put a pencil to this one and here's what I
discovered: Had "Secret Saver" banked her money at 5 percent, she would have
$124,642 today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Say it again. It's not smart to put your money under the mattress.;   --
R.L., Orland Park, Ill.;   DEAR R.L. -- Thanks for your good letter. You were
close, but no cigar.;   Peter R. Frye, senior vice president of LaSalle
National Trust, Chicago, wrote as follows:;   " 'Secret Saver' is an excellent
example of what can be lost in compounding interest rates when money is hidden
at home instead of doing something much safer and more creative.;  
"Alternative A: 'Secret Saver' probably added to her fund each year. Assuming
she contributed $760.87 ($35,000 divided by 46 years) at the end of each year
and earned a 5 percent (after-tax or tax-deferred) yield, she would have a
balance today of $128,347.41.;   "Alternative B: Assume 'Secret Saver' started
with $35,000 in an investment 46 years ago and averaged a 5 percent (after-tax
or tax-deferred) return for 46 years. In 1991, she would have a balance of
$330,199.04.;   "Those who read your column will readily appreciate the value
of compounding interest rates. It should also make them aware of the benefits
of prudent financial guidance.";   DEAR ANN -- My husband died in 1988. Our
marriage was wonderful.;   Ten months ago, I started to see a nice gentleman
who has since proposed. I have put off giving him an answer because I felt
that I was being unfaithful to my deceased husband.;   Yesterday while
cleaning out a closet, I came across an old wallet that belonged to my late
husband. It contained two pictures of our children and two photos of a married
woman co-worker. The pictures were about 15 years old. His co-worker was
married then and still is. I liked her a lot.;   I am deeply hurt and have
come to the conclusion that he had an affair with this woman. With this
discovery came the feeling that I no longer have to be tied to my husband, and
I have accepted my friend's marriage proposal.;   My children think I am
replacing their father and they are unhappy. Part of me feels that if their
father had a secret affair, it should remain a secret. The other part of me
says I should tell my children so they would not be so bitter about my
remarrying.;   -- Freedom Anonymous;   DEAR FREEDOM -- Say nothing to sully
your husband's image. You need not drag your discovery into the picture to
justify your remarriage. After your three years alone, your children should be
thrilled that you have someone with whom you can share your life.  </TEXT>
