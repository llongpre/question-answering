<TEXT>     Personal: She and her husband, Larry, have been married 11 years. She has
three sons by a previous marriage and four grandchildren.;    Home: San Jose.
"Because the interior's decorated in red, white and blue, visitors often say
they expect to hear 'The Star-Spangled Banner' begin at any moment.";   
Background: Her first marriage ended abruptly after 20 years. Divorce is a
difficult issue for Catholics since, under church law, remarriage is not
allowed unless the first marriage is annulled.;    After studying for a
master's degree in religious education at Seattle University, she returned to
the Bay Area to work as director of religious education for three Catholic
parishes.;    She began attending meetings of separated and divorced
Catholics. She started the Rainbow group at Queen of Apostles Church in San
Jose and began a weekly class for divorced Catholics in her home. "It took a
while to get the word out to people, parishes and bishops that being divorced
and Catholic wasn't mutually exclusive.";    From 1981 to 1985 she was
regional representative to the board of the North American Conference of
Separated and Divorced Catholics.;    Working on: In 1982, she wrote "Once
More With Love," a book for divorced Catholics contemplating remarriage. The
guidebook deals with forgiveness, step-parenting, finances, intimacy and
religious faith. She and her husband continue to teach the six-week class in
their home.;    Hobbies: Writing and visiting Monterey and Carmel. She and her
husband are planning a "reading vacation" someday, devoting themselves to
"pleasurable" books.;    Hero: "Janet Ward, an 85-year-old volunteer at the
Independent Aging Program, and my father, a widower who recently eloped to
Reno. As I grow older, I hope that I can be as successful at it.";    Most
important thing to teach a child: "Respect for diversity. Narrow views cause
stress and differences, while flexibility creates acceptance and
accommodation.";    I've learned in life: "Divorce hurts the whole institution
of marriage and I care about that. If I can help teach a few how to survive
that first difficult year, the whole family will have learned wonderful life
skills and have a second chance that was better than the first."  </TEXT>
