<LEADPARA>  DEPENDING on which side of the tie-dyed curtain predictors stood, babies born
to countercultural parents in the 1970s were believed to have one of two
futures: They were either going to be a new species of enlightened,
extravagantly gifted youngsters or they were destined to be psychologically
warped, without any chance to succeed in society.;   According to a new study
from the University of California, Los Angeles, both sides were wrong.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Perhaps to the surprise and relief of more conservative grandparents, the
offspring of hippies, commune-dwellers, strong feminists and others who held
countercultural values generally performed better than average in school,
researchers say. Perhaps to their parents' disappointment, countercultural
children behaved fairly conventionally, even though they were more aware than
other children of such issues as women's rights and ecology.;   "Although
there was great concern at the time of their births, there is no evidence that
these children are not turning out as well or better than the population at
large," said UCLA anthropology professor Thomas S. Weisner, director of the
Family Lifestyles Project. "In that sense, the non-conventional lifestyle is
vindicated.";   In 1974, Weisner and colleagues climbed Northern California
hills looking for pregnant women in communes and screened urban health clinics
statewide for countercultural mothers-to-be. The result was a study group of
203 Anglo children born to single mothers, unmarried couples, or parents
living in communal situations. In addition, the parents all professed what
were considered countercultural values at that time, such as sexual
egalitarianism, non-materialism, environmentalism and a suspicion of
authority, Weisner said.;   Tracked until they entered junior high school at
about age 12, the countercultural children produced school records that put 86
percent of them above median grades and test scores. For example, they
averaged B-plus grades in reading, compared to Bs for a control group of 50
children of married parents with "straight" values, the study says. Their IQ
test scores averaged 113, which was not significantly different from the 114
average score in the control group, but somewhat higher than the national norm
of 100 points.;   On the downside, countercultural families showed a higher
incidence of social and emotional problems, UCLA's project found. About 17
percent of those families grappled with such problems as substance abuse or
instability, compared to about 10 for the general population, Weisner said.
But that is not shocking because the counterculture attracted some troubled
people who really had little commitment to its ideals, Weisner said.;   More
significant, he said, is that most countercultural families taught strong
values to their children, no matter how varied those values or how much they
differed from the larger society's. From that, Weisner drew a lesson for all
parents:;   "Take a broad view. Don't be obsessed if your kids play with guns
or not, if the husband or wife washes the dishes equally, if boys want blue
clothes and girls want dolls," Weisner said. "These kinds of things do not
affect children nearly as much as some parents fear.;   "It is more important
to show children your sense of family commitment, to offer moral guidance and
to show children that there can be more than one way to view the world," he
said, adding that he has been married to the same woman for 23 years and would
describe himself as a conventional husband and father.;   Even drug use by the
parents appears to have had no influence on the children's later success,
although the study did find that most of the mothers limited or stopped using
drugs during pregnancy to avoid harming the babies.;   To be sure, many of the
countercultural families in the study became more conventional in appearance
and lifestyle as time passed, but, the study found, most of the parents held
on to their ideals. Their children, while showing generally mainstream
behavior, also believed in sex egalitarianism and environmentalism more than
their friends from conventional families, according to the UCLA project.;  
Weisner, who co-founded the project with the late UCLA psychiatry professor
Bernice Eiduson, recently presented the findings to a meeting of the Society
for Psychological Anthropology in Chicago.;   Weisner and his colleagues are
hoping to obtain funding for a complete follow-up on the offspring, who are
now about 17 years old. The study would examine in particular sexuality and
feelings of self-worth.;   "The great struggles of adolescence are sexuality
and competency," Weisner explained. "Perhaps there will be some sleeper
effects or latent effects."  </TEXT>
