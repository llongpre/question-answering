<HEAD>Penn, In Rare Interview, Talks About Marriage To Madonna</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Madonna's divorce plans were created by the
press, says her husband, Sean Penn, who vowed in an interview
published Sunday to ``refocus'' himself to avoid outbursts like the
one that landed him in jail.
   Penn, filmdom's bad boy, discussed the strain of being married
to the darling of American pop in a Chicago Tribune interview
billed as the first since he was jailed for 32 days last summer
after striking a movie extra.
   ``I feel uncomfortable commenting about my family situation
because I'm no expert on the subject. Obviously making any family
work is an endless job that's hard enough even when the family
isn't public,'' Penn said.
   Madonna filed divorce papers in Santa Monica, Calif., on Dec. 4,
citing irreconcilable differences. Two weeks later, she asked to
withdraw the petition and the court granted the request the same
day, court records show. No reason was given in the court papers
for her change of heart.
   But Penn, 27, said nevertheless that talk about the possibility
of divorce ``was more People magazine than reality. My attitude
with the press right now is that I hope they've had their share of
me. They've been very busy trying to find or make dirt. I'd like to
get back to acting.''
   Penn said his reported marital problems with Madonna, 29, stem
from her fans' view of him as less-than-ideal marriage material.
   The couple were married Aug. 16, 1985, in a lavish ceremony on a
Malibu, Calif., bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, while news
helicopters buzzed overhead.
   ``She belonged to them, to the public,'' Penn said. ``And if
anybody took her, I think they thought it should have been someone
more acceptable, like Donald Trump.
   ``The public is very possessive about rock stars,'' Penn said,
``and about her in particular. They don't want to share their
love.''
   Penn may not be able to shed his reputation, but he said he
plans to try to avoid future confrontations.
   ``Certainly I've thought about it,'' he said. ``I just have to
refocus myself in another direction.''
   Of his California jail experience, Penn said he was never afraid.
   ``I was in a jail with all the big shots, one person to a cell _
solitary confinement for 24 hours. So afraid, no. But bored, yes.
After about two weeks of that kind of boredom, I think I would have
preferred some fear.''
   Penn spoke with the Tribune after dinner. He had fettuccine with
shrimp. Madonna ``had a Caesar salad,'' he said. ``She always has
Caesar salads.''
