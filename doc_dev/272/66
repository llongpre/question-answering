<TEXT>     In 1976, Hilgeman's infant daughter, Monica, was kidnapped by her
ex-husband. It took four-and-a-half years and thousands of dollars, but
Hilgeman finally found her daughter in Mexico.;    "She was asleep when I
found her," says Hilgeman. "I put my arms around her and cried silently. I
told her in Spanish I was her mother. She didn't remember me.";    This
experience now fuels her passion, the Vanished Children's Alliance (VCA) she
founded to deal with international custody battles, parental child abductions
and missing children. The San Jose organization adds about 1,400 new cases a
year to its national caseload.;    Between 700,000 and 1 million children
disappear annually, according a study by the U.S. Department of Justice. Over
the last 10 years, the state department has received more than 2,700 inquiries
for help from U.S. citizens trying to find children they fear have been
kidnapped to another country.;    A U.S. Senate report shows California
leading the nation with 184 cases of international child abductions; New York
is second with 152 cases.;    Parental child abductions involving U.S.
citizens to date have taken place in West Germany (232 cases); Mexico (146);
United Kingdom (126); and Italy (108), as well as other countries.;    "It's
difficult when kids are (stuck) in foreign countries because of our lack of
international agreements -- but it's worse when these cases involve places
where women don't have equal rights.";    Such is the case of Ashraf Taheri,
who hasn't seen her son, 10, and daughter, 14, for five years, since her
ex-husband took them into hiding while they still lived in Iran. She's now in
San Jose, hoping American organizations, such as the VCA, will be more helpful
than the Iranian government.;    The VCA has a 60 percent to 70 percent
success rate in cases in which it has played a role, says Hilgeman.;    Since
Mahmoody's return to the United States in 1986, the memory of her own torment
has lingered. "Two weeks ago, I woke up screaming," she says. "I dreamed (my
ex-husband) was standing right over me, ready to choke me. I couldn't go back
to sleep.";    Publicizing the names of potentially dangerous ex-spouses is
important.;    "I want the world to know who he is if he contacts foreign
embassies," says Mahmoody. "I'm not saying don't marry a foreigner. But as our
world becomes smaller, more people will inter-marry. They'll have children.
What happens to the children in case of divorce?";    Mahmoody is now writing
"Not Without Our Children" with attorney Arnold Dunchok. Together, they
founded One World: For Our Children, a Michigan-based organization that deals
with international child abductions and custody issues.;    "We're working
(toward) a federal parental child abduction statute," says Dunchok.;    But he
adds, "The ideal solution is for the government of one land to respect the
rights of children from another land. We need international agreements that,
in a sense, create one world -- a safe one -- for our children."; GROUPS
