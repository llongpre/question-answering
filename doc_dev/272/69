During the early 1970s, a radical notion arose that husbands should share the 
work at home. This idea, which set men hyperventilating all over America, was 
followed by the plague of lists. 
</P>
<P>
"Up against the refrigerator door!" Mister. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, he would 
cook. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, she would do the laundry. He would wash, she 
would dry; he would drive the kids to school, she would pick them up; they 
would live equally ever after. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began power struggles over the vacuum, wrangles over the dryer, the 
diapers and the children in them. She would insist, he would resist. Actively 
or passively. Progress was often followed by slippage. And articles about 
sharing housework were followed by articles about "The Women's Lib Divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, how quaint it all seems now. So petty. Can you believe that we once argued 
over something so minor in the great scheme of the universe as changing the 
sheets, dear? That love was limited by the list? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the late 1980s. The lists have come down. So has the heat. There is 
an uneasy truce or maybe simmering hostility in two-worker households. 
</P>
<P>
He is doing more than his father and feeling under-appreciated. She is doing 
more than her husband and feeling undervalued. There is a friction between 
women whose lives have changed faster than the men they share them with. There 
is a stalemate over the household. 
</P>
<P>
Now Arlie Hochschild, a Berkeley professor, has written a book on the subject 
that puts work at home back where it belongs: in the context of marital 
relationships. "The Second Shift," her study of two-career parents over eight 
years, describes what goes on in the hours before and after our "real jobs." 
</P>
<P>
She begins with what we know. The wage gap in the outside world is mirrored by 
a leisure gap at home. Women are "working" on average one month a year more 
than their husbands. About 20% of men in her study shared the second shift 
equally, 70% did more than a third and less than a half, and only 10% did less 
than a third. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the most egalitarian households, Hochschild suggests, women did 
two-thirds of the daily jobs -- cooking -- while men did jobs without the same 
deadline -- bills, repairs. When men shared, they were more likely to take over 
child care, leaving women with the same amount of housecare, a job they found 
much less satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Through her intimate portraits of families, we get to dissect the emotional 
meaning of the work disparity. "When couples struggle," she says, "it is seldom 
simply over who does what. Far more often it is over the giving and receiving 
of gratitude." What happens to gratitude when a wife wants help at home and a 
husband "gives her" the paycheck that comes from more time at the office. 
Neither gets what he or she wants. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the many small, telling observations of this book, Hochschild notes: 
"In my interviews, a surprising number of women spoke of their fathers helping 
their mothers 'out of love' or consideration . . . . But not one man . . . made 
this link between help at home and love." 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, she says that "more couples wanted to share and imagined that they 
did." But the quest to keep reality in line with ideals sometimes stretched 
that imagination mightily. One of the couples devised an equal "division of 
labor" this way: He took care of the dog and garage; she took care of the child 
and house. They called it a deal. 
</P>
<P>
In the basic deal of the '80s, most women whose husbands are not sharing have 
giving up trying to change the division of labor. They have their own 
strategies for working the second shift, "They were either super-moming, 
cutting back their hours at work or cutting back at home." 
</P>
<P>
They stopped pushing their husbands to change, Hochschild believes, because 
"getting help at home was second on their wish list after 'want fewer tensions 
at home.' " This fear of divorce quieted many women's demands. But at the same 
time, women whose husbands didn't share thought about divorce more often, and 
women who did divorce listed "neglect of home and child" as their chief 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
I have always assumed that the argument about who works the second shift was 
less about labor relations than about personal relations. Not surprisingly, 
those men who "win" the argument about housework, whose wives work that extra 
month, lose a good deal to exhaustion and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line of Hochschild's study is, after all, that difficult-to-quantify 
thing called happiness. What one thing did contribute to marital happiness? She 
reports unequivocally: "the husband's willingness to do the work at home." Put 
that on the refrigerator door. Right where they used to post the lists.
