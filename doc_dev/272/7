<LEADPARA>  THE cheery, we'll-muddle-through mother has been a fixture of British
melodramas since the war years. The prototypical home-front mum was played by
Greer Garson in MGM's "Mrs. Miniver"; John Boorman's "Hope and Glory" and
Peter Medak's "The Krays" offered richer, darker variations in the person of
Sarah Miles and Billy Whitelaw.;   And now you can add Alison Steadman's name
to the honor roll of English mums who toil, scrimp and sacrifice out of the
goodness of their hearts. Steadman's Wendy is the chipper, easily amused
Middlesex mother in Mike Leigh's aptly titled "Life Is Sweet" (now playing).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At first, she appears flighty, a maddening airhead straight out of some
dumb British sitcom; but when things take a turn for the worse and the
family's undercurrent of desperation is revealed, she blossoms into a heroine
every bit as resourceful and strong as Mrs. Miniver.;   Steadman, on the phone
from London, describes Wendy as "silly and irritating" but "the backbone of
the family." First impressions, the actress adds, are definitely misleading in
the case of this woman.;   Wrong impressions;   "Very often when we first meet
people, we get an impression that is often the wrong impression," says the
45-year-old Steadman, who, with husband Leigh, has two sons. "At first Wendy
is quite annoying, but with a buoyant sense of humor. As more is revealed, the
audience begins to see Wendy as a three-dimensional character, a survivor.";  
Much the same could be said of actress Steadman, a household name in England
but virtually unknown on these shores, save for her work in TV's "The Singing
Detective" and the movie "Shirley Valentine" (she played Jane, the best friend
who invites Pauline Collins on a getaway to Greece, then abandons her).;  
With "Life Is Sweet" now seducing art-house audiences, this could change.
Critics on both sides of the big pond are saying Oscar ought to take a closer
look and recognize Steadman in the best-actress category.;   Steadman has
heard such talk, but dismisses it as kind but farfetched. "The Guardian
(newspaper in London) wrote, 'If we were living in fairer times, Steadman's
performance would be considered for an Oscar.' It's quite flattering when
someone says that, but we're so low-budget it's unlikely we'll be
remembered.";   Like Leigh's other social satires ("High Hopes," "Abigail's
Party"), "Life Is Sweet" was developed during a four-month rehearsal session
in which the cast was encouraged to research and create their characters from
scratch. Steadman refuses to divulge her model, but will say she never saw
Wendy as a heroine. That side of her emerged in the finished film.;   "When I
saw the film, I was quite moved by Wendy. I thought she said a lot about women
who do cope with a helluva lot in life. Women are still being left to look
after the kids and keep things going while men duck out and quickly move on to
new relationships. That hasn't changed.";   Though "Life Is Sweet" is far more
naturalistic than, say, something like "Shirley Valentine," it still offers a
view of lower middle-class life that some may find sugar-coated. Feminist
critics have been known to sharpen their incisors on happy-go-lucky characters
like Wendy. Steadman agrees, but points to Leigh's latest as a "refreshing
alternative" to Britain's harsher depictions of family life, found in "The
Krays" and especially Terrence Davis' "Distant Voices, Still Lives.";   Hardly
ideal family;   "I don't think it ('Life') is a terribly romantic film," she
politely avers. "This is not exactly the ideal family. It's fraught with
problems. One daughter is a butch plumber; the other is anorexic. These are
not the kids that, ideally, Andy (Jim Broadbent) and Wendy would have
wanted.";   Still, the film emphasizes the positive and leaves one in an "up"
mood. "We haven't heard from the feminist lobby about this film. Most of the
crits (reviews) have been rejoicing in the warm relationship. Wendy is a
fighter, and the audience gets a buzz from seeing a survivor. Instead of
giving up on the whole situation, she soars above it, and in the end kind of
wins.";   From what Steadman can tell, the public is tired of being preached
to. "They're fed up with feminists with no humor . . . with the kind of
somber, humorless feminist dramas. People in general, I think, are sick of
this.";   Steadman next will play opposite Dudley Moore and Patsy Kensit in
Disney's "Blame It on the Bellboy," a mistaken-identity farce set in Venice,
Italy. This comedy is due in England in January, stateside in March. Steadman
describes it as "good fun . . . very light and funny. It's basically about a
hit man and a husband who's off for a dirty weekend, but winds up with the
wrong girl. I'm the wife who chases after him.";   As for Steadman appearing
in her husband's next ensemble piece, that remains to be seen. Leigh doesn't
discuss his works-in-progress because there's nothing to discuss. He doesn't
know what shape they'll take until he confers with his cast. "I'd love to be
in it, but it depends on if he asks me. He doesn't go round the house chatting
about it.";   You can bet it won't be a sequel to "Life Is Sweet" or some
Hollywood variation. "Hollywood wants to be in control. They say, 'Here's a
million dollars, it's got be about this. You've got to make a film about X, Y
and Zed. Mike likes to start from a completely blank sheet. So he can't tell a
producer what his film is going to be about. It's not his thing. He's never
compromised. He's one of the few people in this business who has stuck to his
principle."  </TEXT>
