<LEADPARA>  In a case that some experts saw as a potential landmark for a generation of
women who put their husbands through professional school, a state appeals
court refused Tuesday to order a lawyer to increase his wife's spousal support
of $2,500 a month to help her finish medical school.;    The 1st District
Court of Appeal, in a 3-0 ruling, said a note that Gwendolyn Stephens' husband
wrote her suggesting a "lifeplan" in which she would put him through law
school and he would then put her through medical school was "simply too
indefinite to constitute the terms of any marital agreement."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In that note, Roland Stevens wrote: "We go to (No.) 1 law school then go to
Europe as foreign service pilot, whatever and you become M.D," he wrote.;   
Later, before a divorce court, Stephens offered a translation: She would put
her husband, then an Air Force pilot stationed overseas, through law school,
and he would then support her through medical school.;    Stephens, who now
uses her maiden name, and Roland Stevens were married in 1969. He left the Air
Force several years later and entered law school, graduating in 1977, while
his wife worked as a microbiologist. When the couple separated in 1985, her
lawyer said, Stevens was making $144,000 a year as an attorney.;    Their
divorce became final in 1987. Also that year, Stephens quit her $40,000-a-year
microbiology job and entered the University of California, Davis medical
school, from which she is scheduled to graduate next year. Saying she was
managing only with the help of student loans, she sued her ex-husband for
increased support, contending he had promised it both orally and in his
letters.;    The case gives state courts a chance to revisit a legal dispute
of the mid-1980s over the rights of one spouse who has put the other through
professional school.;    A 1985 state law orders the judge in a divorce case
to reimburse a spouse, through support payments, for contributions to
education or training that substantially increased the other spouse's earning
capacity. The law does not consider the increased earning capacity itself to
be property whose value must be divided equally.;    The appeals court in the
current case said Marin County Superior Court Judge Richard Breiner had
considered Stephens' support for her husband's legal education in ordering
$2,500 a month in spousal support, payments that are tentatively scheduled to
end four months after she graduates. She also gets $310 a month for each of
their three children.;    The opinion by Justice Robert Merrill also said
there was substantial evidence to support Breiner's conclusion that Stevens
had not promised to put his wife through medical school. Merrill said Breiner
should have ordered him to pay a substantial part of her legal fees in the
case, however.  </TEXT>
