<LEADPARA>  Gwen Stephens says she would have done better as a live-in lover than as
Roland Stevens' properly married wife of 16 years.;    If she can convince the
courts she's right, her divorce may become a landmark case for a generation of
women like her who put their husbands through professional school, experts say.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At the heart of the case is a promise Gwen Stephens says has remained
unkempt -- Roland Stevens' pledge to put her through medical school.;    When
Gwen and Roland were married in August 1969, the San Jose State University
graduates were brimming with plans for their future. Gwen had wanted to become
a physician since she was 14. Roland first dreamed of becoming an airline
pilot, then later a lawyer.;    "Hey, how's this for a life plan-work plan,"
Roland wrote Gwen in a letter during the early years of their marriage. "We go
to  1 law school, then go to Europe as foreign service pilot, whatever and you
become an M.D.?";    But in 1985, the two parted. By then he was a successful
San Francisco attorney specializing in aviation injury law and had recently
begun earning a hefty salary -- nearly $150,000 a year. Gwen, having supported
her husband through law school and a rocky career start, was left with three
children, a $40,000-a-year job as a medical technician and years of delayed
ambitions.;    Now 42 and a third-year medical student at UC-Davis, Gwen says
she and Roland had an agreement that she would support him through law school
and then he would support her through medical school. She wants the court to
say that agreement was a legally binding contract and order Roland to support
her through 13 years of medical training and pay her compensation for the
years she put her career on hold for his.;    "I was persuaded to put off
medical school for the good of the family, but I was very reluctant," Gwen
said in a recent interview. "I didn't agree to do it for his benefit. I feel
now like I was an indentured servant.";    But Roland, 43, and now a staff
attorney for PG&amp;E, says he doesn't think they had an agreement.;   
"Discussion of your future doesn't constitute a contract," he said.;    And
anyway, Roland said, the $3,120 monthly support he has been ordered to pay her
and the two children still at home is sufficient to finance her schooling and
family expenses.;    "As far as I'm concerned she's already gotten what she's
asking for," he said.;    In May 1989 after a three-day trial, Marin County
Superior Court Judge Richard H. Breiner ruled in Roland's favor. During 16
years of marriage, Gwen had been the sole support of the family for 4 1/2
years and a major source of support for 8 1/2 years, the court found.;    But
the judge ruled there was "no enforceable agreement.";    Gwen has appealed to
the state's 1st District Court of Appeal in San Francisco in a case that is
being closely watched by women's groups. Both the California Medical
Association and the California Commission on the Status of Women have
expressed interest in filing briefs in support of Gwen's position.;    "The
CMA is interested in seeing fairness and access to medical education for
women," said Elizabeth Bader, attorney representing the medical association.; 
  Queen's Bench, a female-attorneys group, also has expressed an interest in
the case.;    "It's definitely looming out there as an important case," said
Moira Buxbaum, president of Queen's Bench. "We want to be supportive of that
generation of women who did not pursue their careers and . . . put their
husbands through school, only to find themselves divorced.";    Gwen says she
is prepared to take the case to the California Supreme Court if necessary.;   
Beyond the specific facts of the case, the two sides are struggling over
definitions of contracts and marriage that reflect changing social views and
new economic realities, legal experts say.;    In situations like Gwen and
Roland's, current law favors husbands over wives, who overwhelmingly end up as
the ones supporting spouses through professional training, said Carol Bruch,
professor of law at UC-Davis and an expert on family law.;    "Courts have in
general been only willing to say, 'These aren't promises meant to be
enforced,' and that's unfortunate," said Bruch. "If he said, 'I will do this
for you if you do this for me,' he should be held to it.";    For Mary Ann
Mason, professor of law and social welfare at the School of Social Welfare at
the University of California, Berkeley and author of "The Equality Trap," the
case illustrates anew why people should put their marital agreements in
writing.;    "Marriage is a contract, but often it's not based on informed
consent," Mason said.;    The case poses new questions: Can such agreements be
judged by contract law or does that simply reduce marriage to a commercial
transaction? And which is fairer, anyway?;    Roland's attorney, Mauna Berkov,
calls such arguments "ridiculous.";    "You would have things like, you
promised me a mink coat when we were married and we're not married anymore but
you still owe me a mink coat," Berkov said.;    William McPherson, Gwen's
attorney, argues that something is amiss with a system that grants live-in
lovers rights it denies to married people. The highly publicized Lee Marvin
palimony case established the right of live-in lovers to have domestic
contracts.;    "A contract can't be considered less just because they are
husband and wife," McPherson said.;    If he could do it over again, Roland
says he wishes Gwen had gone to medical school early on. For him, there is no
important legal principle at stake.;    "This is just the story of a long
marriage that ended unhappily," Roland said.;    Gwen, on the other hand, says
she made the right choice supporting Roland. That's how marriages are supposed
to work, she said.;    Still, she has cautioned her daughters.;    "I tell my
daughters, whatever you do, don't get married," Gwen said.  </TEXT>
