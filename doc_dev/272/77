<TEXT>  By Emily Wortis Leider; Stanford University Press, 379 pp., $24.95;  THE
imperious blond beauty who wrote 56 books had opinions on everything and a
long life in which to express them. Born in 1857 in a San Francisco of wooden
sidewalks, Gertrude Atherton died in the city of her birth as it was preparing
to host the first meeting of the United Nations in 1948.;    By her 90th year,
Atherton, whose likeness adorned the murals of the old St. Francis Hotel, had
turned into a terrifying grande dame with mandarin political views who
disapproved of literally everything. In her youth, however, she had appalled
Woman's Page readers with an article on how to murder your husband, and the
legend still lingered that her own estranged husband had been delivered to her
door embalmed in a keg of rum after his death at sea.;    Born Gertrude Horn
to a hysterical Southern belle obsessed with aging and a failed tobacco
executive obsessed with drink and gambling, she grew up on her maternal
grandfather's ranch in the Santa Clara Valley three miles from the village of
San Jose. A compulsive reader, at 17 she took her nose out of her book long
enough to elope with her mother's 24-year-old lover, George Atherton, a
hapless hunk who quickly earned Gertrude's contempt by failing at every
business venture. Her mother-in-law Dominga, a rigid Chilean aristocrat, kept
saying, "Ladies in Spain do not write," but Gertrude turned a local scandal
into a first novel that was serialized by a San Francisco weekly.;    Gertrude
Atherton's total lack of maternal instinct -- she held her baby son upside
down and glued back his protruding ears -- so horrified Dominga that she took
over the nursery, leaving Atherton free to nurse her discontent with marriage
in general and George in particular. When he died on board ship en route to
Chile, Atherton, who did not bother to hide her relief, left their daughter
with Dominga (the son had died of diphtheria) and went to New York to write.; 
  There had been novels about adulteresses written by women, but Atherton's
"Hermia Suyen" was about a never-married seductress. The New York World
reviewer, a man, was aghast; "the book cried out for a policeman, not a
critic," he wailed, and described it and Atherton in terms of bodily
corruption: "Her genius is varicose, her talent vascular and flabby, her
tissues dropsical." Her next novel was about a seductive nun.;    The raw
energy of her narrative power made her books sell but she wrote much too fast.
Driven by an enormous ego that craved fame and power -- she often said that
the first sight of her name in print made her "as insatiable as a child for
sweets" -- she did not take the time to edit herself or control her tendency
to run on with prolix verbosity. She simply wanted to be published, and she
was. Oscar Wilde was reading one of her novels when he died; her fellow San
Franciscan, Alice B. Toklas, worshiped her.;    Feminists in England, where
she went to live at the height of the suffragette movement, naturally assumed
they had an ally in such a daring sister. They were wrong. She was a loner who
detested groups and meetings, and, like so many gifted women, a consummate
Queen Bee who enjoyed making fun of feminists.;    "They had grim mouths," she
wrote, "and clairvoyant eyes, were worn to the proportions of a shingle, and
filled with a cold enthusiasm that had drained their egos of all human
feeling. . . . They were fanatics on ice with about as much charm as an embryo
in a bottle. . . . They were detestable as women, but as scientific martyrs
they were a commanding success.";    She also had a mean streak that she
seldom troubled to hide which shocked proponents of humanitarian causes. She
became positively gleeful when telling exaggerated stories of her husband's
"containerization" in the rum barrel after his death at sea. (He was in truth
shipped home that way but not delivered to her door.) She expressed envious
admiration for H. Rider Haggard's She, "who could hurl a bolt of lightning and
shrivel a man to one long cinder." Nor could she resist the gratuitous insult,
as when she told the French ambassador: "The only way left in this world to be
distinguished is not to be decorated by France." (She relented later and
accepted the Legion of Honor).;    Her long intimate friendship with San
Francisco Mayor James Phelan notwithstanding, Atherton was probably as chaste
as her heroines were sensual. According to the German doctor who administered
the rejuvenating Steinach Treatment to her in 1922, she wanted her ovaries
stimulated not to make her more sexual but to produce hormonal energy for her
work. (One of her most popular novels, "Black Oxen," was about a woman who
received the Steinach Treatment). Still alive in 1980, the doctor went on
record with the statement that he thought her frigid and believed the creative
process had become her substitute for procreation.;    If she ever met her
match it was Ambrose Bierce, who enjoyed insulting women writers with
references to the "gray batter of their brainettes." Requesting an interview
with him, Atherton wrote: "I hate you generally, but think you would be
interesting." The meeting turned into a day-long wrangle that ended when
Bierce tried to kiss her, but they continued to correspond for several years.
Bierce repeatedly tried to break her of her sloppy writing habits, pounding
home his favorite maxim, "brevity is the soul of wit," but Atherton's prose
remained spready.;    Emily Wortis Leider, a San Francisco writer and book
critic, has no such fault. Her style is so tight and clean, her transitions so
seamless, that the reader's eye is pulled across the page in an unbroken
rhythm as if set on optical cruise control. A typical passage is this dazzling
analysis of the Bierce-Atherton relationship:;    They frightened one another.
He was afraid she would prove smarter than he was, stronger and more
successful. She was afraid by turns of his censure and his too ardent pursuit.
Both feared yielding power and control. Their views of one another, and of the
opposite sex, are so defended, so heavy with contradictions, they pauperize
the word "ambivalent." They wove nets of inconsistency, two misanthropes in
search of company, attracting and repelling, praising and reviling: a man who
loved but hated women, whose confused standard of propriety allowed him to
blast the morals of a book and then try to seduce its author; a woman who
sheathed her Puritan heart in siren's chiffon and who became the most intimate
when she was the farthest distance away. The wonder is they liked each other
so much.;    The author makes it clear that she does not always like Gertrude
Atherton, especially when she is discussing Atherton's pitiless Social
Darwinism that turned into near-fascism in the 1930s, but she is scrupulously
fair and balanced in her treatment of this sometimes maddening, often
irresistibly funny termagent of letters who was so regal that even her own
grandchildren called her "Mrs. Atherton."  </TEXT>
