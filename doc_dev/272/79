   Star performances can enliven the creakiest of
drawing room comedies, making the artifical and old-fashioned seem
charming, funny and even poignant.
   That is the case at the Ambassador Theater where Rex Harrison,
Stewart Granger and particularly Glynis Johns resuscitate W.
Somerset Maugham's ``The Circle,'' a hit from the 1921-22 Broadway
season. If it weren't for this stylish trio of veterans, the play,
which opened Monday night, would be little more than lightweight
stuff.
   For nearly a half-hour after the curtain rises on designer
Desmond Heeley's opulent, flower-filled drawing room, Maugham sets
up the plot, laboriously laying out the gossipy past. He tells how
30 years ago, the beautiful Lady Kitty ran off with the great Lord
Porteous, leaving behind her husband Clive and 5-year-old son,
Arnold.
   Now, three decades later, Arnold's head-strong but romantic
wife, Elizabeth, has invited the errant mother and her lover for
lunch. Of course, Kitty's ex-husband will be there, too, so the
prospects of an uncomfortable reunion are downright certain.
   To add to the embarrassment, history may repeat itself.
Elizabeth has fallen for another houseguest, Teddy, a handsome
colonialist from Malaysia. The plot turns on whether Elizabeth will
run off with Teddy, making the same decision her mother-in-law made
so many years ago.
   That is the principal plot development, but there is more fun in
watching the aging lovers quarrel, renew their relationships and
sharpen the points of their decades-old triangle.
   Harrison, as the elderly playboy Lord Porteous, resembles a
blinking British Buddha, ever so polite and perplexed as he lumbers
about the stage. He's still in love with the woman he ran away with
30 years ago, but ardor can be taken for granted after so long a
time. And life keeps getting in the way.
   Harrison's role is small, almost a throwaway, but the actor is
such a presence that he makes it seem better and bigger than it
really is. No one can growl out a line the way he can.
   Both Porteous and especially Lady Kitty realize what they have
given up for love. He could have been prime minister. She gave up a
devoted husband and young son. Maugham's play makes some
surprisingly serious statements about the tradeoffs that people in
love must make.
   Lady Kitty is the play's most frivolous yet perceptive
character. Old age becomes her enemy, not her ex-husband.
   ``The tragedy of love is indifference,'' she counsels the
distraught Elizabeth. That's why she dyes her gray hair, dresses in
girlish pink and wears a lot of makeup. She won't give up without a
fight.
   Johns is superb. She plays the role delicately, yet with great
comic spirit. She knows just how far to go with Kitty's
scatter-brained comments and actions. And there are genuine tears
when she cries over an old photograph of her much younger self.
   If Granger, as Kitty's long-abandoned husband, can't quite keep
up with the two other stars, he does a credible job. Clive is the
odd man out. But Maugham does not turn the husband into a moper.
And he seems a more satisfied person than the lovers who did him
wrong.
   Director Brian Murray, who supervises things at the slowest
possible pace, has less luck with the triangle of younger lovers.
Roma Downey and Harley Venton are earth-bound as Elizabeth and her
new-found love. Robin Chadwick is prissy and unconvincing as her
husband. You wonder why she married him in the first place.
   But audiences are there to see Harrison, Johns and Granger, and
you feel cheated when the other actors are on too much of the time.
When the stars are center stage, ``The Circle'' seems complete.
When they are not, this drawing room comedy is drawn out far too
long.
   Critic Linda Winer, however, found the play ``creaked and
wheezed a lot and managed to charm quite a bit,'' she wrote in New
York Newsday.
   ``Johns' lilting, autumnal voice is perfect; so is her fragile
sense of duty. Rex Harrison has raised crotchetiness to a great
art. ...Granger has charm in abundance,'' Howard Kissel wrote in
the Daily News.
   When Johns and Harrison argue, The New York Times' Frank Rich
said, ``one feels her bitterness even as one exults in the verbal
chamber music created by two of the most distinctive speaking
voices in the English theater.''
   Critic Clive Barnes, writing in the New York Post, praised the
whole cast, especially Harrison's ``stately and ineffable charm
tinged with a very correct arrogance.''
