<HEAD>Woman Sues Ex-Husband For Filling Out Questionnaire In Her Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A woman has sued her ex-husband, claiming
he filled out her class reunion questionnaire with defamatory
information, including that one of her hobbies is ``looking for new
and wealthier husbands.''
   In a suit filed in Ramsey County District Court, Sharon K.
Silver alleges that her former husband, Gerald H. Pfeffer of
Willernie, received the high school class reunion questionnaire and
sent it back with false allegations.
   The responses were published in a reunion publication and seen
by 100 former classmates, according to the suit.
   Under the heading ``Achievements Most Proud Of,'' Pfeffer wrote,
according to the suit, ``My three divorces and how each time I
married into more money to the point where I am now living on the
$400,000 settlement and interest from my third divorce.''
   The suit also said Pfeffer wrote that his ex-wife's hobbies were
night clubbing, partying and looking for new and wealthier husbands.
   Under the heading ``Secret Ambition or Fantasy,'' the suit
claims Pfeffer wrote: ``Seeing if I can't get married as many times
as Liz Taylor and gain my riches through divorces instead of
working.''
   Pfeffer could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
   The reunion committee for Silver's class of 1958 sent out
questionnaires last spring asking for information to be included in
a publication for former classmates, the suit said.
   Silver, who now lives in West Virginia, claims the questionnaire
fell into Pfeffer's hands when it was mailed to her old address in
Willernie.
   She is seeking in excess of $50,000 in damages, claiming the
false allegations have caused her a loss of reputation.
