   A woman convicted of adultery and
sentenced to death by stoning has been aquitted in a retrial and
freed.
   Shahida Parveen, 25, said Tuesday: ``I have started a new life,
I prayed to God who helped me and my husband get justice.''
   A district court judge in this southern city issued the
acquittal verdict Monday.
   Ms. Shahida was convicted on Nov. 7, 1987 of adultery by an
Islamic court that sentenced her to death by stoning.
   She had been jailed on the basis of a complaint filed by her
former husband, Khushi Mohammad, after she married Mohammad Sarwar,
her cousin. The court declared she was still legally married to
Khushi Mohammed.
   Ms. Shahida, a carpenter's daughter, was only 13 when she
married Khushi Mohammad, who was 40 at the time.
   She told the Islamic court that she and Khushi Mohammad were
divorced in April 1986 because she could not have children and he
wanted to marry another woman. The court ruled that divorce
documents she presented were forged.
   Last December The Associated Press wrote a story on the case as
Ms. Shahida was imprisoned in Karachi.
   That report and others led Mohammad Khan Junejo, who was prime
minister at the time, to examine the case and he asked Interior
Secretary S.K. Mahmud to review the convicion and sentencing.
Following an investigation the retrial in district court was
ordered.
   Islamic law requires a confession or statements by four
witnesses to prove adultery. The district court ruled that Ms.
Shahida had not made a confession and there were no witnesses.
   ``My months in prison are days I cannot forget,'' she said
Tuesday. ``I was a victim of circumstances and my former husband
wanted revenge because I married Mohammad Sarwar.''
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haz's government introduced elements
of Islamic law into Pakistan's legal code in 1979.
   Two women previously were sentenced to death by stoning, but the
sentences were reduced to jail terms and flogging.
