YOU CAN'T DO BOTH by Kingsley Amis Hutchinson Pounds 15.99,306 pages
I have it on good authority that when, some time ago, Sir Kingsley Amis was
approached for his support for the 'Swansea - City of Literature' campaign,
the distinguished man of letters replied, '---- off]' This may seem an
understandable reaction from someone who once spent 12 years as a junior
lecturer in that town, although in his Memoirs he wrote sentimentally of the
place.
It is a reminder that Amis has a thing about South Wales and the Welsh -
nothing so strong as love-hate, more an appalled fascination, an exasperated
affection. Certainly the principality (a word he must surely detest) has
served him well in his fiction, never better than in the Booker-winning The
Old Devils which, with its TV version, brought him less than a welcome west
of the Valleys.
South Wales provides only one of the minor locations in his new novel, You
Can't Do Both, but his main characters are all Welsh at one remove and are
always conscious of it - the 'hero' Robin, the girl friend Nancy, and their
four parents.
The blurb cannot resist telling us that You Can't Do Both will be seen by
some (not this reader) as 'a precursor to Lucky Jim', presumably on the
grounds that Robin Davies, whom we follow from teens to parenthood, is of
the same generation and the same profession as Jim Dixon. Come to think of
it, just like Sir Kingsley] - which must be why the blurb also clumpingly
declares that this novel is 'strongly autobiographical'.
Can that be true, and does it matter? Robin Davies is brought up in South
London, enjoys his grammar school, visits family in Wales, goes up to
Oxford, serves unheroically in the war, becomes a red-brick don, makes his
Nancy pregnant, snatches her back from an abortionist, marries her, and
continues with his selfish ways until . . .
Let's allow that Amis may be drawing more heavily than is usual on his
recollections of adolescence and young manhood: there are plenty of
references which sound echoes from the Memoirs (which was not an
autobiography but a sequence of sketches), and the early chapters are no
doubt based on his childhood in Norbury, never mind the later scenes of
Oxford colleges, Cardiff abortionists and registry office weddings.
What matters is that Amis is on masterly form, with proof on every page that
he can write the most brilliantly accurate dialogue in the trade. And of
course, he can be very funny indeed, though it is often the humour of
embarrassment. There are two magnificently awful fathers.
Robin Davies is another version of the favourite character - the plausible,
intelligent, sex-obsessed, self-aware young man - whom Amis would (and does)
call a shit (yes, in the tradition of Jim Dixon, and he makes funny faces
too). He knows that 'he was almost an ideal non-husband for Nancy, being
selfish, self-indulgent, lazy, arrogant and above all inextinguishably
promiscuous by nature'; about marriage he feels 'apathy relieved with
horror', yet he is caught in an insoluble dilemma and marries the sweet and
not-quite-convincing Nancy. I quote:
'A few minutes later, Nancy said, 'I've remembered something else my Dad
said about you. No, it was my Mum. No, it was my Dad. I know it doesn't
matter which really. Or at all. Anyway, he said you were the kind of man who
thinks only of his own pleasure'.
'This Robin heard with definite indignation. He said, 'I'd like to know how
he makes that out, I must say. If that's all I was interested in, what the
hell does he think I'm doing getting married to you? Jesus Christ.'' Here is
the genuine Amis: colloquial, fast, witty, acid, and conveying character.
But there is a more serious burden to this morality tale, growing out of the
comic routines which Amis uses to reveal the curiously loving relationship
between father and son.
Robin's father turns out to be the shadow-side of the Welsh preachers he has
left behind, just as it is Nancy's father who spots that Robin is 'the kind
of Welshman who gets Welsh people a bad name. Very charming on the surface
and treacherous underneath.'
