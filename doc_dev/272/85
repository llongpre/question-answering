   A woman accused of killing her husband and
another woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin wrote a bank five days
before his death to say the couple's money problems would soon be
over, a prosecutor said Thursday.
   But under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne
Maida, Stella Nickell denied telling FBI investigators that she
expected to benefit from the 1986 death of Bruce Nickell, 52.
   ``I told them I didn't expect to benefit at all because money
was not important to me. My husband was. I would have sooner had
him than any amount of money,'' Mrs. Nickell said.
   The 44-year-old Auburn woman is accused of five instances of
tampering with over-the-counter medicine, including two cases
involving deaths, in the first such death-by-tampering ever to go
to trial in this country.
   Both the defense and the prosecution rested their cases later
Thursday, and closing arguments were scheduled for Monday.
   Prosecutors charge Mrs. Nickell plotted the death of her husband
to collect $176,000 in insurance benefits and put other tainted
pain-relievers on the shelves of area drugstores to make the
tampering appear random.
   Sue Katherine Snow, 40, of Auburn also died in June 1986 after
swallowing cyanide-laced Excedrin. If convicted, Mrs. Nickell could
face life in prison.
   Ms. Maida called a rebuttal witness who said Mrs. Nickell's
daughter, Cindy Hamilton, told her of Mrs. Nickell's plans in
November 1985, more than seven months before Nickell died.
   The witness, Katherine Parker of Tacoma, said Ms. Hamilton, her
former roommate, told her, ``Katy, do you know what my mother just
said to me? She asked me how much cocaine it would take to kill a
person.''
   Ms. Hamilton ``said that her mother had been talking about
getting rid of her father. ... She was getting tired of him,'' Ms.
Parker said.
   Ms. Hamilton had testified Tuesday that her mother had discussed
putting cocaine in Nickell's iced tea to make his death look like
an overdose.
   Mrs. Nickell, asked Wednesday if she had ever told her daughter
that she intended to poison her husband with cyanide, or that she
had attempted to kill her husband, replied, ``No.''
   Earlier Thursday, under questioning by Ms. Maida, Mrs. Nickell
confirmed that she and her husband owed three banks and an
investment company $8,553 in April and May of 1986, but she denied
that their financial situation was getting worse.
   On April 25, Mrs. Nickell wrote one bank that she was having
``marriage problems'' that would soon be solved. Five days before
Nickell's death, she wrote the same bank that ``my payments will
now stay current,'' Maida said.
   Mrs. Nickell's attorney, public defender Tom Hillier, ended his
examination of her by asking if she killed her husband.
   ``No I did not,'' she answered in an steady voice.
   ``The thought never entered my mind and never would because I
loved Bruce too much,'' she said. ``There's no way I'd ever think
of getting rid of him.''
   Hillier also asked her if she tried to copy the unsolved Tylenol
tampering case in which seven people died in the Chicago area in
1982. Mrs. Nickell denied that accusation, raised by her daughter
in earlier testimony, as well as claims she planned to leave her
husband.
   Ms. Maida had Mrs. Nickell read passages about cyanide from
``Deadly Harvest,'' a library book Mrs. Nickell borrowed in 1983
and 1984. The book dealt with poisons and poisonous plants.
   ``Cyanide is often employed as the lethal substance in murder
mysteries,'' Nickell read slowly as a packed courtroom and a U.S.
District Court jury listened.
   Mrs. Nickell denied taking notes from ``Deadly Harvest'' when
Ms. Maida said some of Mrs. Nickell's 87 fingerprints found in the
book were cut off by a straight line, as if by a piece of notebook
paper.
   During her testimony Wednesday, Mrs. Nickell tearfully told of
watching Nickell collapse, saying she never knew he was dying.
   ``Babe, I feel like I'm going to pass out,'' she quoted her
husband as saying before he collapsed at their home June 5, 1986.
   Mrs. Nickell described her husband as a loving, good-natured man
with a sense of humor. She denied telling family members her
marriage was unhappy or that their periodic financial stresseshad
threatened their marriage.
   Prosecutors allege she forged her husband's signature on
insurance paperwork. But she said signed the forms with his
permission because he ``despised paperwork.''
