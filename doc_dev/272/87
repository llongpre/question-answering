   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The AIDS scare probably has a lot to do with it,
and religious training certainly does, but there are a lot of
people out there just saying no to sex before marriage. Now there's
a support group for them, the National Chastity Association,
founded by a divorced mother of two.

   The sexual revolution has spawned a group of
counter-revolutionaries, adults committed to celibacy before
marriage.
   Bucking societal trends, more than 400 men and women of varied
ages and backgrounds have found a haven in the National Chastity
Association.
   Some members have never had sex, but others have been married.
Many say they didn't join for any religious or moral reasons _
they're just fed up with the singles' bar scene and empty
relationships.
   Many admit they've had a difficult time convincing others they
are not weirdos.
   ``I've been humiliated, ridiculed, laughed at, made fun of,''
says Jance Hodge, a 30-year-old from Holbrook, Mass., who has never
dated and believes in premarital chastity because, ``It was the way
my mother brought us up.''
   When she heard about the group, ``I was totally psyched because
I was saying to myself, there are finally other virgins out there
besides me.''
   Elaine Marsh, a 35-year-old legal secretary from Orange County
near Los Angeles, found her new husband through the group.
   They began corresponding in November and first decided to get
married this May. But impatience intervened and they eloped on
March 30, one day after they had met each other in person for the
first time.
   ``When you can't do certain things before you get married, you
want to hurry up,'' Ms. Marsh says.
   She says neither was disappointed.
   ``We're discovering more and more things in common,'' she says.
``It's great.''
   Ms. Marsh had been single since her divorce six years ago. Three
years ago, she became celibate.
   ``It comes from my religion, but it's more than that,'' she
says. ``I just feel it's such a precious part of yourself, you
don't give it to someone when you haven't made the commitment of
marriage.''
   The decision wasn't an easy one.
   ``I had friends try and talk me out of it,'' she says. ``I had a
man say to me, `Why should I spend money on you if you're not going
to have sex with me, because 99 out of 100 women will?'''
   The pressure became too much to handle.
   ``I stopped dating, it was that difficult,'' she says. ``I got
tired of wrestling matches basically, so I just said forget this.''
   She joined the chastity association last June.
   ``I was really glad to see that there was actually a group that
has the same outlook that I have,'' she says. ``That's pretty hard
to find in Southern California.''
   Experts say there's no evidence of any major national trend
toward chastity, but concede the AIDS scare has made many some
singles shy away from intercourse.
   The National Chastity Association, a non-religious group,
founded less than two years ago by a divorced suburban mother of
two, functions as a kind of dating service and support group.
   Mary Meyer, 37, says she formed the group after suffering too
many heartaches from bad non-platonic relationships. She tried
joining a singles club and placing personal ads in local
newspapers, but failed to meet a man who shared her values.
   ``I love hand-holding, I love kissing, I love caressing, I love
sex,'' she says. ``But even more than I would love to experience
these things right now, I want to be able to have a relationship
where I can experience them forever.''
   Convinced that the best way to find an ideal mate is to build a
non-physical relationship before marriage, Ms. Meyer formed the
group based on what she calls the ``19 desires.''
   They include the desire to save hand-holding, kissing and sex
until marriage and to be close friends with someone for at least
two years before considering marriage.
   Members pay $15 a year, and get their names published in a group
directory that lists brief descriptions of members and their values.
   Lorraine Althea, a model in her 30s from Los Angeles, joined
about a year ago.
   ``I have fooled around a lot but I just reached a point where
I'd had enough, and I just wanted something more,'' she says. ``It
gets to the point of being boring. Men are after you all the time.''
   Fear of AIDS had something to do with her decision, but more
than that, Althea says, she ``was just tired of that shallow
feeling.''
   Since joining, Althea says she's met lots of celibate people.
   ``You begin to feel like you're the only one, but you're not,''
she said. ``We're not prudes. We've been around.''
   David Dismore, 43, a video archivist for feminist groups in
Southern California, says chastity is the sexual revolution's
forgotten ingredient.
   ``Some people think liberation means glorification of casual
sex,'' he says. ``I think the definition of sexual liberation is
the right to freely and comfortably say `no.'''
   Clergyman Joe Leonard of Wayne, Pa., who is involved in a
project on human sexuality for the National Council of Churches in
Christ, says he sees no trend toward chastity.
   ``I don't see any evidence of it, frankly,'' despite the
National Chastity Association, he says.
   Neither does Jerome Sherman, a Houston psychologist and
president of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors
and Therapists.
   ``We don't find that more people are saying no to sexual
activity,'' Sherman says.
   ``The question is not should you have any sexual activity before
marriage, because it depends on each individual.''
   In other words, to each his own.
