   When Congress passed the Marriage Fraud Act in 1986, the goal was to protect the country from the growing number of immigrants using marriage as a ploy to obtain their green cards. 

   But now there are signs that the law may have exceeded its intent by creating a trap for immigrant women. 
Many of these women say they must endure abuse by their husbands while waiting the two-year period required for permanent residency. 
They fear reprisal if they complain: Without the husbands' support of their residency applications, the wives risk deportation. 

   Since 1986, immigrants have been marrying American citizens at an annual rate of about 130,000. 
During the same period, immigration lawyers, family counselors and shelter operators have noticed a sharp increase in the number of battered and abused immigrants who feel caught in the situation. 

   A 30-year-old Chinese woman in San Francisco says she finally left her husband after months of abuse. 
Repeated beatings and her husband's disregard for their infant son's health finally drove her to leave their home. 
"He bring the spray for ants," she says, recalling an incident when she hadn't cleaned the bathroom. 
"He spray my face." 

   To obtain permanent-resident status, the law requires that a marriage last for at least two years. 
Ninety days before their second anniversary, the couple must submit a joint petition to change the conditional status to permanent residency. 
But if the application isn't filed with the U.S. citizen's signature, the law says the immigrant spouse is subject to deportation. 

   "They are at the mercy of their spouse for a variety of reasons other than the abuse," says Charles Wheeler, National Center for Immigrants' Rights director. 
The husband typically controls the finances, and the wife must defer to him for money. 
Besides financial clout, the husband has the ability to deport his wife, "a powerfully coercive threat," says Douglas Schoppert of the Legal Assistance Foundation in Chicago. 
But the present law has many defenders. 
Congress passed it after hearing testimony from scores of American women who claimed they were jilted by foreign men seeking only a green card. 
"The door was so wide open, Congress felt it had to find a way to close it," recalls Verne Jervis, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 

   Others are skeptical of the marriage-trap thesis, speculating that the situation may not be as serious as the immigrants claim. 
Says Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R., Wyo.), former immigration subcommittee chairman: "Battered nag maybe." 

   "The basis for {the current law} is to assist the American citizen," Sen. Simpson adds. 
"The original intent was not to help the alien, but the American citizen." 

   Even so, such agencies as the Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Services in San Francisco have counseled dozens of marriage-trap victims. 
In one case, a Chinese woman's husband had abused her for almost two years and repeatedly threatened not to sign the petition. 
Pregnant with her second child, she delayed filing for a divorce for fear of losing custody of the children. 

   Counselors say many women stay in the marriage in hopes that their husbands will sign the petitions. 
But many others, unable to endure the abuse, run away to a shelter, and still others already face deportation proceedings. 
The law "creates a chilling effect," says Rodel Rodis, a San Francisco immigration attorney. 

   The problem seems to affect Asian women more than other immigrants. 
And the growing number of "mail-order bride" businesses, most of which target Third World countries, aggravates the situation more, says Janet Noodleman, National Coalition for Domestic Violence director. 
The law encourages "the whole aspect of wife shopping," she says. 

   The law provides that if the woman can prove "extreme hardship," or if she files for a divorce before her husband, the INS may grant a waiver to allow her to remain in the country. 
The INS says it received more than 3,700 waiver applications from married immigrants in the first half of this year, compared to only 108 for all of last year. 

   Rumblings about the law have reached Capitol Hill. 
Rep. Louise Slaughter (D., N.Y.) introduced legislation in June that would lift the joint-petition requirement -- provided the immigrant can prove mental and physical abuse as well as a bona fide marriage. 

   But some supporters of the current law say it's too early to tell whether the law has done more harm than good. 
For now, Mr. Jervis of the INS contends, U.S. policy addresses "the greater evil."
