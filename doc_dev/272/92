<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- Will you do me a special favor and print two letters from me in
your column? The first I wrote to my husband 15 years ago. The second I mailed
to him last night. Thank you.;   -- R.L.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Date: Aug. 1, 1960;   DEAR JACK -- For what seems like the millionth time I
walked into the house tonight and you were not here. You aren't out fooling
around. You are at work on the night shift. I never wanted you to take that
shift, and we argued about it. You thought it was well worth the extra money.
I told you I didn't care about the money, that I'd rather have a normal family
life. But I lost the battle.;   Our children are sick of hearing me say, "Shhh
-- your father is asleep." They can't bring their friends home after school or
practice the piano. I can't have a table of bridge or the garden club meetings
here. You need your rest.;   The years slip away so rapidly. We seem to be
growing farther apart. I look at you and see a tired, middle-aged man who
needs regular hours, regular meals and a regular routine.;   I realize you are
doing what you think is best for me and the children, but you're wrong. Will
you please reconsider? I love you.;   -- Your Wife;   Here's the second
letter, which I mailed July 1, 1975:;   DEAR JACK -- When the judge said,
"Divorce granted," you vaguely resembled a man I used to know -- but you
looked about 40 years older.;   Our children view you as a stranger. You
missed out on all the fun when they were growing up. The few good friends we
had eventually dropped us because we could never seem to get together.;   So
now our marriage is over. If it had been another woman, I would have felt
better. But it was something far more insidious -- that night shift. Good-bye
and good luck, dear.;   -- Your Ex-Wife;   DEAR FRIEND -- Thanks for sharing
your sad story. Perhaps someone, somewhere, will learn from it.;   DEAR ANN --
Our son is 21, a college junior and a serious student. The young woman he has
been dating since his freshman year is very attractive, well-mannered,
studious and I like her.;   The problem: My husband knows they have been
having sex for the last year (at least) and he really despises the girl
because of it. If she were our daughter, it might be understandable. But why
my husband has these hostile feelings toward her is beyond me.;   They are in
love and plan to marry. I hate to think of the trouble ahead for this girl
because of my husband's irrational attitude. How can I help?;   -- Trouble
A-Brewin';   DEAR BREW -- Don't argue with your husband about the situation.
Just keep the lid on.  </TEXT>
