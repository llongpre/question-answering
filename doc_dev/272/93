   Like many middle-aged and older Americans,
Carolyn Connor was raised to believe that nice people didn't get
divorced.
   But at 49, she's been married, divorced, remarried and widowed.
   ``Society raised me to think it was an embarrassment to get a
divorce. But he was an alcoholic... When I got a little money from
my grandfather's estate, it gave me the guts to leave,'' said
Connor, who was divorced at 33.
   ``It really makes me feel sorry for people who don't have the
money.''
   Sociologists say that while divorce rates have stabilized for
younger women, they are increasing for older women. And newly
divorced middle-aged and older women have a harder time financially
than widows or those divorced early.
   ``Almost everyone recognized there was a tremendous increase in
divorce rates since the 1960s,'' said Peter Uhlenberg, a University
of North Carolina sociologist. ``Divorce is concentrated in younger
women _ most occur before age 40. Women in later life, those who
are old now, have not been affected by these changes. We're trying
to anticipate what happens when women in their younger adult years
hit their 60s and 70s.''
   Uhlenberg and his associates, Teresa Cooney, now at the
University of Delaware, and Robert Boyd, presently a graduate
student at the University of South Carolina, used data from the
U.S. Census, Vital Statistics and Current Population Survey for
their study, published in the January edition of the Journal of
Gerontology: Social Sciences.
   They found that one woman in eight will have her first marriage
end in divorce after she reaches age 40. And the probability of
remarriage is slim, decreasing rapidly with age. In 1985, for
example, researchers found fewer than three out of 100 divorced
women aged 45 to 64 remarried.
   ``There are competing explanations for why more older women are
getting divorced and remaining unmarried. It's becoming more
feasible for women to support themselves outside of marriage. There
are more work opportunities. The age before marriage has gone up.
The whole idea of being married is becoming less likeable after
doing it once,'' Uhlenberg said.
   The economic status, family relationships, social support and
emotional stability of recently divorced middle-aged and older
women vary dramatically from those comparably married, widowed, or
long-termed divorced women.
   ``Much more often, a widowed woman will have a house, which is a
major asset going into old age,'' Uhlenberg said. Widowed women are
also more likely to have their husband's pension as a source of
income, but for divorced older women, the social implications are
very different.
   ``A widowed woman is much more likely to be living independently
and not working,'' he said. ``Divorced women are compensating
economically by sharing their living expenses and working.''
   ``It takes a while to recover financially from divorce,'' said
Ms. Connor, who has worked as a secretary for three years to
supplement her late husband's disabled veterans' benefits. ``And at
the time I divorced, they didn't really enforce child support. I
had my husband arrested twice for not paying and all they did was
put him in jail overnight and then let him go.''
   The picture becomes more bleak for older minority women,
Uhlenberg said.
   ``Divorce rates are significantly higher for blacks. We know
that. The economic implications are about what they are for white
women. It's just that more black women will experience economic
disadvantages.''
   Another factor affecting divorce rates is the increased
acceptability of single mothers and co-habitation before marriage,
he said. And the more these types of families exist, the less
likely children of such groups are to be socialized into the
pattern of stable family relationships.
   ``What we're doing now is looking at one of the implications of
divorce on older men,'' which will be published this month, he
said. ``Specifically, the impact of divorce on older men and their
relationship with their children.
   ``We've found that older divorced men are much less likely to
have contact with their adult children. They report the
relationship to be less satisfactory.
   ``For women, we find a greater impact on an economic level,
while for men, the implication would be in terms of social
support.''
