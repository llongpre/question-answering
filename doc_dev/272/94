   Roseanne Barr's husband wants a gag to work -
one from a court, not from her hit TV show.
   Tom Arnold filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Superior Court charging
that Miss Barr's former husband and his attorney violated a court
order by discussing the comic's divorce publicly.
   Arnold said ex-husband William Pentland and his attorney,
palimony lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, discussed the divorce on the
``Donahue'' show in November.
   Arnold's lawyer, Martin Singer, asked a judge to sentence
Mitchelson to 30 days in jail and Pentland to 15 days for contempt
of court. Singer said Mitchelson ``has engaged in a widespread
publicity campaign to try to maliciously disparage and defame Tom
Arnold in direct violation of the order.''
   Mitchelson said he would file a countersuit, saying it was Miss
Barr who called into ``Donahue'' and discussed the divorce. She
also made disparaging remarks about the divorce on Arsenio Hall's
talk show, he said.
   Pentland, who was married for 14 years to Miss Barr, filed a
palimony lawsuit in August seeking at least $15 million from her
and $3 million from Arnold.
   Miss Barr plays a sarcastic, overweight housewife on ABC's
``Roseanne.''

   EATONTON, Ga. (AP) - Officials in the town where Alice Walker
was born want to build a trail honoring the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of ``The Color Purple.''
   Ms. Walker, 46, now is honored in Eatonton only with a street
named for her and with books on display at the Chamber of Commerce.
   Organizers of The Color Purple Educational Fund Foundation,
which helps needy students, want to create a trail passing Ms.
Walker's birthplace, her mother's home and the cemetery where her
father and other relatives are buried.
   Plans also call for erecting a monument in the courthouse
square.
   ``I wish we had a museum,'' said City Councilman Ulysses Rice.
   Ms. Walker's novel about Celie, a poor black woman forced to
live with a man who loves another woman, was made into a movie
starring Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey.
   Other works by Ms. Walker include ``You Can't Keep a Good Woman
Down,'' ``I Love Myself When I'm Laughing'' and ``Meridian.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Tom Cruise married Nicole Kidman, his co-star
in ``Days of Thunder,'' in a private ceremony at a Colorado ski
resort.
   Few details about the Christmas Eve wedding were disclosed, but
Cruise's spokeswoman, Andrea Jaffe, said the 30-minute civil
ceremony was witnessed by a handful of family members. Honeymoon
plans weren't disclosed either.
   It was the first marriage for the Australian actress and the
second for Cruise, whose nearly three-year marriage to actress Mimi
Rogers ended in January in divorce.
   Cruise, 28, met Miss Kidman, 23, while filming ``Days of
Thunder.''
   The couple are in pre-production for their next film together,
``The Irish Story,'' directed by Ron Howard.
   Cruise's movies include ``Risky Business,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``The
Color of Money,'' ``Rain Man'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Miss Kidman is filming ``Billy Bathgate,'' co-starring Dustin
Hoffman.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) - Nolan Ryan, the 43-year-old pitcher who threw
his record sixth no-hitter and won his 300th game in 1990, has been
named the Sporting News Man of the Year.
   ``Ryan represents the quintessential sports role model - a
uniquely talented athlete who has accomplished feats and
demonstrated a responsible understanding of his role as a public
figure,'' Sporting News publisher Thomas G. Osenton said Wednesday.
   The Texas Rangers hurler led the American League with 232
strikeouts last season and also pitched his record-tying 12th
one-hitter. He got his 300th victory on July 31 against Milwaukee.
   Ryan is 302-272 lifetime with a record 5,308 strikeouts.
