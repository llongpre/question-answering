<TEXT>  Putnam, 416 pp., $22.95;  HOW can I ever please my mother? How can I even keep
from being a source of disappointment and pain to her? These were the
questions that Amy Tan worked on in "The Joy Luck Club.";    And
Chinese-American daughters, Protestant daughters, Jewish daughters, Catholic
daughters, Japanese daughters, Bolivian daughters, Latvian daughters and a
fair number of sons took Tan's first novel to their hearts.;    It seemed, at
first, as though it would be fair to Tan to review "The Kitchen God's Wife" as
if "The Joy Luck Club" didn't exist. But from the opening words we know that
Tan has no intention of leaving her first book behind. "The Kitchen God's
Wife" begins with this sentence: "Whenever my mother talks to me, she begins
the conversation as if we were already in the middle of an argument.";   
Fairy tale success;  "The Joy Luck Club" was hard to ignore when it was
published in 1988. Booksellers developed a special affection for the story of
four mothers who fled China in 1949 and their four California-born daughters.
Booksellers have mothers, too, but they were also delighted to have a readable
and intelligent first novel to recommend.;    What's more, they could
participate in the fairy tale of Tan's success. The unknown 37-year-old San
Jose State graduate received a $50,000 advance for her first book, and it went
straight to the New York Times best-seller list. Tan turned out to be
talented, gracious and unspoiled, and not a soul begrudged her good fortune
when the paperback rights sold for $1.24 million.;    So this one is about a
mother and daughter, too, but where "The Joy Luck Club" was true to life, "The
Kitchen God's Wife" is larger than life. In "The Joy Luck Club" the energy of
the story was dispersed among two quartets of mothers and daughters; here
there is one daughter, one mother. And this mother, Winnie Louie, tears the
story away from her daughter and runs with it.;    First to explain the title.
Long ago in China, as Winnie Louie tells the fable, a rich farmer named Zhang
left his hard-working wife for a carefree woman named Lady Li. Lady Li used up
all his money and ran off with another man. Zhang went from house to house,
begging. Delirious, he finally found one woman who would take pity on him. As
he came to consciousness in her kitchen, he realized that the kind lady was
his wife.;    The overlooked woman; Naturally, he jumped on the kitchen fire,
because he was so ashamed. In heaven the Jade Emperor said, "For having the
courage to admit you were wrong and your wife was right, I make you Kitchen
God, watching over everyone's behavior. Every year, you let me know who
deserves good luck, who deserves bad.";    Winnie, who is nothing if not
sensible, objects to being judged by a man who cheated on his wife. It was the
wife who was the good one, she says, and "The Kitchen God's Wife" is an act of
honoring the good woman who has been overlooked.;    The story begins in the
here and now, but then leaps into the there and then. The here couldn't be
more here -- it's San Jose, where 40-year-old Pearl Louie lives with her
Anglo-American husband, Phil, and two daughters. Her mother, Winnie, born
Weiwei in 1919 near Shanghai, runs a hopelessly drab little business -- a
tiny, dusty flower shop in a Chinatown. She set up shop when her husband, a
minister, died of cancer 25 years ago, when Pearl was 14.;    The daughter's
secret; The argument that opens the book arises when Winnie insists her
daughter drive up to San Francisco for a cousin's engagement party. Pearl
can't stand her cousin Bao-Bao, who works at The Good Guys, drives a Camaro,
and has been married three times already. Moreover, Pearl and Winnie's
conversations are congenitally strained by what is not said.;    For her part,
Pearl has kept secret for seven years her symptoms of multiple sclerosis. She
is tired but not yet debilitated. She loses her balance sometimes. She hasn't
told the diagnosis to her mother because, "According to my mother, nothing is
an accident. She's like a Chinese version of Freud, or worse. Everything has a
reason. Everything could have been prevented.";    What we don't realize at
first, as the story gets set up, with U.S. daughter vs. immigrant mother, is
that the set-up isn't the beginning of the story. It's a comparatively thin
frame for the big and boldly executed canvas that is Winnie's story. Pearl's
illness is like the gun of Chekhov's famous dramatic rule (if you have it on
stage in Act I, it had better go off by Act III), but just as Chekhov isn't
about gunplay, "The Kitchen God's Wife" isn't about Pearl's fate. That is left
in the wake as her mother's story steams ahead.;    'Terrible danger is
coming';  And the story really steams, through Winnie's awful first marriage
and the rape of Nanking and the bombing of Shanghai and death and famine and
bed bugs and unexpected heroism and unexpected cruelty and wonderful romance.
We learn the very frightening and useful Chinese word taonan, which has no
exact English equivalent. "It means," Winnie says, "terrible danger is coming,
not just to you but to many people, so everyone is watching out only for
himself." "The Winds of War" meets "The Woman Warrior.";    Winnie's life is a
whale of a story, but it begins in a way that may throw readers off the track.
The lengthy flashback to Winnie's youth lacks what they call in the movie biz
an establishing shot. Where are Winnie and Pearl sitting as Winnie tells her
story? Who's watching Pearl's daughters, ages 8 and 3, while this goes on? How
long does it take to tell this story?;    The story intends to sweep away
realistic details like those. It's a fairy tale. Winnie is abandoned by her
mother, who may have died or may have run away with a lover. The aunts who
raise her show her no tenderness. "In my heart," she says, "There is a little
room. And in that room is a little girl, still 6 years old. She is always
waiting, an achy hoping, hoping beyond reason. She is sure the door will fly
open, any minute now.";    Desperate for tender attention, she marries the
charming Wen-Fu, a completely bad man. There follows a touching unconsummated
love for a young pilot who dies after a crash and then a wonderful
Chinese-American soldier who somehow finds a way through the chaos of war to
rescue Winnie. The bad husband and the good lover are separate people, which
is a clue that we're in a fairy tale. In real life, most of us are dealt a
parent or spouse who combines good and bad. In fairy tales, the qualities are
portrayed as separate people. (Cinderella's stepmother, for example, is the
real mother who has begun to demand that her child do a little work around the
house and stick up for herself.);     There's also a Northern Californian
feminist addition to the fairy tale form. When Winnie finally dumps Wen-Fu,
she runs away to a house that's an underground hiding place for women who had
awful marriages. As in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple," and Alice Adams'
"Superior Women," the heroine flees to an ideal community of women -- a kind
of Sorrow Luck Club.;     "The Kitchen God's Wife" is a page-; turning epic
spanning decades and leaping oceans and all that goes with epicdom. But Tan's
intelligence makes it more than that. For example, the doomed young pilot who
truly appreciates our heroine, a staple of wartime epics like Rosamunde
Pilcher's "The Shell Seekers," becomes much more, as Tan tells it. Winnie
holds herself back from the young pilot. "I was a married woman," she says,
"Yet I had never felt love from a man, or for a man. And that night I almost
did. I felt the danger, that this was how you love someone, one person letting
out fears, the other drawing closer to soothe the pain. And then more would
pour out, everything that has been hidden, more and more -- sorrow, shame,
loneliness, all the old aches, so much released until you overflowed with joy
to be rid of it, until it was too late to stop this new joy from taking over
your heart.";    "The Kitchen God's Wife" redeems itself; it's more than a
fable. But it has a fable at its heart. The moral is the first bit of spoken
dialogue in the book. "Pearl-ah have to go, no choice," says Winnie. If your
mother's life is larger than life, encompassing war, plague, famine and
romance, and if you really listen to her story, you have no choice but to do
what your mother says.;    One mother in Tan's first book, "The Joy Luck Club"
despairs of her daughter -- "I couldn't teach her about Chinese character. How
to obey parents and listen to your mother's mind." "The Kitchen God's Wife" is
416 pages of listening to a mother's mind.;    As the book closes, Winnie is
choosing a gift for Pearl, some statue of a god or goddess who will help her
daughter through her trials. Winnie rejects Wen Ch'ang, the traditional god of
literature, in favor of an improvised goddess -- The Kitchen God's Wife -- the
woman who hasn't been honored yet. Tan makes the same choice.  </TEXT>
