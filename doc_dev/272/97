   The entertainment industry mourned Thursday's
death of actress Ava Gardner, the sexy Hollywood glamour queen of
the '40s and '50s whose personal life sometimes matched her femme
fatale screen roles.
   ``My heart is broken with the loss of my first love,'' said her
first husband, Mickey Rooney, after stepping off a plane in
Orlando, Fla. He was 21 when he married the 19-year-old Miss
Gardner in January 1942.
   ``The beauty and magic of Ava will forever be in all of our
hearts,'' Rooney said.
   The star of 60 motion pictures, including ``The Barefoot
Contessa'' and ``Night of the Iguana,'' died of pneumonia in
England at her home in Kensington, West London. She was 67.
   Miss Gardner and Rooney divorced in late 1943. She was also
married to bandleader Artie Shaw for a year and to Frank Sinatra
for 5{ years. Her last marriage ended in 1957.
   ``Ava was a great lady, and her loss is very painful,'' said
Sinatra, whose remarks were relayed by his Los Angeles publicist.
   Gregory Peck, her co-star in ``On the Beach'' in 1959, praised
Miss Gardner's acting.
   ``She was much better than she thought she was,'' Peck said from
his home in Beverly Hills. ``She had no vanity about her talent,
but she will stay in the minds of millions. ... She did nothing
that lowered her standards as an actress or as a lady.''
   A floral display from the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce was
placed over Miss Gardner's sidewalk star along the Hollywood Walk
of Fame.
   Miss Gardner's reputation as a sex goddess was launched in the
1946 film ``The Killers,'' which also catapulted the fledgling
career of co-star Burt Lancaster.
   ``She was a wonderful lady, wonderful lady,'' Lancaster, 77,
said from his Los Angeles home. ``I did my first picture with her.
She was a very simple lady. She used to come down to the beach with
us and cook and play with the kids.''
   ``I think she was the last great beauty,'' said Michael Winner,
who directed Miss Gardner in a horror film, ``The Sentinel,'' in
1977.
   ``She epitomized to an English lad the glitter and beauty of
Hollywood,'' Winner said in England.
   ``Ava was a great star who gave us all so many wonderful moments
on the screen,'' former President Ronald Reagan said from his
Century City office. ``She was a dear friend who Nancy and I will
miss.''
   Victoria Principal, who worked with Miss Gardner on ``The Life
and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' in 1971 and ``Earthquake'' in 1973,
said the actress influenced her career.
   ``Ava Gardner was my ideal and in many ways my role model. And
to have made two films with her was my privilege,'' Miss Principal
said from her Beverly Hills home. ``She was beautiful, talented,
spirited and uniquely her own person, and for as long as there are
films she will exist.''
   Beverly Hills attorney Paul Caruso, a longtime friend, knew Miss
Gardner as an unassuming woman who was unaffected by the Hollywood
publicity mill.
   ``She never thought she was a movie star, (she) thought she was
a lousy actress,'' Caruso said. ``She thought she was a little
country girl from North Carolina.''
   Director Joseph Mankiewicz, who directed her in ``The Barefoot
Contessa,'' praised her earnestness.
   ``If something came along she did it and she enjoyed it,''
Mankiewicz said. ``I don't think Ava ever put body and soul into
her performance. She put body and soul into living a life. That was
as happy as she wanted it to be.''
   Larry Kasha, a longtime friend of Miss Gardner who is also
co-executive producer of CBS-TV's ``Knot's Landing,'' persuaded the
actress to appear on 10 episodes of the show in 1985.
   ``She was so right for our show, a terrific addition to our
show,'' Kasha said. ``I'm very sad about the loss of a very special
lady. She was wonderful, and I think she was much more talented
than she was given credit for. She really understood what she was
doing.
   ``But the nicest thing I liked about Ava was she was a great
animal lover. She used to worry about her dog all time. She asked
me to bring my dog to the set so she could walk him and visit with
an animal. She loved animals.''
   One of Miss Gardner's sisters, 74-year-old Myra Pearce of
Winston-Salem, N.C., spoke with the actress by phone this week
because her husband, B.C. Pearce, had died.
   ``She was my sister, and I just thought she was wonderful,''
Mrs. Pearce said Thursday.
