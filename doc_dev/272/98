Most of the best movies of veteran screen star Barbara Stanwyck, who died last 
week, have been released on video. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of her quality movies were made between the late '30s and the 
mid-'50s. Here is the cream of that period -- all available on cassette: 
</P>
<P>
"Stella Dallas" (Nelson, 1937). In one of the great no-holds-barred soap operas 
of the 1930s, Stanwyck plays a good-hearted, lower-class woman who consistently 
puts her daughter's happiness ahead of her own. Stella's unsophisticated ways 
-- and horrible taste in clothes -- ultimately cause her social-climbing 
daughter (Anne Shirley) much consternation. Of the great self-sacrificing 
heroines, Stella is in a league with the Gladys George's suffering character in 
the 1937 version of "Madame X" and Bette Davis' spinster in "The Old Maid." 
</P>
<P>
"The Lady Eve" (MCA, 1941). One of the two or three best movies by 
writer-director Preston Sturges. In this hearty romantic comedy, Stanwyck, 
flashing impeccable comic timing in early scenes, plays a card-shark who works 
the ritzy ocean-liner circuit, fleecing wealthy passengers. Her prize prey is a 
shy millionaire (Henry Fonda). However, her con job goes awry when she falls 
for her pigeon. 
</P>
<P>
"Ball of Fire" (Nelson, 1941). In director Howard Hawks' fast-paced, screwball 
comedy, Stanwyck stars as a tough-talking burlesque dancer who, while running 
from the police, moves in with a group of stuffy professors who are working on 
an encyclopedia. Of course, she falls for one of the scholars (Gary Cooper). 
Even the out-of-control, slapstick ending doesn't really spoil this one. One of 
Stanwyck's comic peaks. 
</P>
<P>
"Meet John Doe" (Media, 1941). In one of director Frank Capra's more 
sentimental homages to the common man, Stanwyck forcefully portrays a cynical, 
conniving reporter who hatches a plan to turn a naive drifter (Gary Cooper) 
into the leader of a national grass-roots movement. But a corrupt politician 
(Edward Arnold) plots to use the scheme for his own devious purposes. Brimming 
with wartime idealism and cornball Americana. Cooper's performance is really 
the heart of this movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Double Indemnity" (MCA, 1944). One of the best of the hard-boiled '40s 
melodramas. Stanwyck plays a scheming wife who plans, with a smitten insurance 
agent (Fred MacMurray), to kill her husband and collect the insurance. The 
major obstacle is the agent's clever boss, played by Edward G. Robinson. As 
good as Stanwyck is, she is overshadowed by MacMurray, who gives the best 
performance of his career as the man led astray by illicit passion. The script 
was co-written by detective novelist Raymond Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas in Connecticut" (MGM/UA, 1945). This is the wrong season for this 
one, but so what? Stanwyck stars as a columnist who, to save her job, has to 
arrange a cozy Christmas in Connecticut for a soldier (Dennis Morgan). Though 
one of her more obscure movies, Stanwyck's chemistry with Morgan transcends 
anything generated with Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda in more famous romantic 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" (Kartes Video and Congress Video, 1946). 
Terrific performance by Stanwyck as Ivers, a rich, powerful temptress with a 
shady past. Her husband (Kirk Douglas, making his film debut) capitalizes on 
her dark secret. One of the best evil-woman roles of her career, but this one 
is usually neglected by fans and historians in favor of her work in "Double 
Indemnity." 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, Wrong Number" (Paramount, 1948). This showy, somewhat overwrought 
performance was her last good shot at a best-actress Oscar but she lost out to 
Jane Wyman in "Johnny Belinda." Stanwyck plays an obnoxious, bedridden woman 
who torments her husband (Burt Lancaster). Overhearing a murder plot on the 
phone, she figures out that she's the target. 
</P>
<P>
"Executive Suite" (MGM/UA, 1954). Taut, well-written, star-studded drama of 
corporate in-fighting, co-starring William Holden, June Allyson, Fredric March 
and Shelly Winters. Stanwyck is effective in a relatively small role as a 
pivotal stockholder, but it's really Holden's movie. 
</P>
<P>
The best of rest on video: 
</P>
<P>
"Golden Boy" (RCA/Columbia, 1939). Notable as William Holden's debut as a 
leading man, but he is guilty of overacting (as are Stanwyck and Lee J. Cobb) 
in this tale of a young man who choses boxing over a career in music. Clifford 
Odets' dialogue now seems laughably overripe. 
</P>
<P>
"Lady of Burlesque" (Video Yesteryear, 1943). Lively suspense comedy about the 
search for a killer who is strangling strippers with their own G-strings. 
</P>
<P>
"Clash by Night" (United, 1952). Moody love triangle with Stanwyck effectively 
playing an unhappy wife. Co-starring Paul Douglas, Robert Ryan and, in a 
secondary role, Marilyn Monroe. Very hard to find in video stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Blowing Wild" (Republic, 1953). Underrated, steamy action-adventure tale about 
another love triangle involving an oil baron (Anthony Quinn), his wife 
(Stanwyck) and her ex-lover (Gary Cooper). 
</P>
<P>
"Cattle Queen of Montana" (Buena Vista, 1954). The best thing about this 
routine Western, featuring Stanwyck as a powerful rancher battling Indians and 
crooks, is the spectacular scenery. But it's infamous because it boasts 
possibly the worst performance in the career of co-star Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Maverick Queen" (Republic, 1955). Rousing action Western about a feisty 
bad girl (Stanwyck as a saloon owner) falling for a good-guy lawman (Barry 
Sullivan). 
</P>
<P>
Not yet on video but worth seeing if and when available: 
</P>
<P>
"The Bitter Tea of General Yen" (1933), "Always Goodbye" (1938), "Union 
Pacific" (1939), "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" (1938, co-starring Humphrey Bogart), 
"The Furies" (1950), "All I Desire" (1953), "Witness to Murder" (1954), "The 
Violent Men" (1955) and "There's Always Tomorrow" (1956).
