   Just a little more than a year after the Dow
Jones industrial average first reached 2,000, the stock market has
adopted that level as a regular hangout.
   Since the crash in October that sent the average tumbling into
the low 1700s, the market has rallied back to around 2,000 four
separate times. On each of those occasions, the advance has bogged
down at that point.
   Now, Wall Streeters hope, it may be ready to clear that obstacle.
   Many stock market analysts say it is simplistic or even silly to
talk about round-number levels in the Dow as measures of any
significance for the market outlook.
   When investing institutions measure their performance against
the market as a whole, these analysts point out, they usually don't
use the Dow, but rather the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
composite index.
   Nevertheless, Dow 2,000 appears to provide a good reference
point for the current state of the market.
   It served as one of the landmarks of the great 1982-87 bull
market when the average first surpassed it on Jan. 8 of last year.
   And one emphatic message of the crash on Oct. 19 seemed to be
that the Dow in the 2000s was too high.
   Now that a semblance of stability has returned to the
marketplace, a new symbolic appraisal has been made: Improvement in
the trade deficit and a decline in interest rates have warranted a
return to the threshold of 2,000 at least.
   But to buy stocks much above that level is still considered a
risky proposition.
   ``When the market rallies almost to 2,000 one contingent
believes _ loudly _that it is already running into trouble,''
observed Justin Mamis in a current market commentary for the
investment firm of Cowen &amp; Co.
   ``Another group quickly gets labeled on TV as `emergent bulls'
and insists they've never given up faith in new Dow highs.''
   In the past week the industrial average closed above 2,000 on
Tuesday and Wednesday after the Washington's Birthday holiday,
slipped back briefly, and then jumped ahead again. It closed Friday
at 2,014.59, up 31.33 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.10 to 146.96;
the American Stock Exchange market value index 3.16 to 280.16, and
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market 3.85 to
357.12.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 160.98 million shares a day,
against 179.43 million the week before.
   Of course, there are many more elaborate ways to measure the
level of the market than simple gauges of stock prices.
   By some of those yardsticks, argues Suresh Bhirud at Oppenheimer
&amp; Co., stocks ``appear attractive relative to both bonds and their
own historical average valuation level.''
   For instance, Bhirud figures that the S&amp;P 500 now stands at 12
times projected earnings for this year _ a price-earnings multiple
he calls attractive in a period of low inflation.
   If you adjust the S&amp;P 500 for inflation, he adds, it is 30
percent below where it was in 1968. And the market value of stocks
is now 58 percent of the nation's gross national product, compared
with 118 percent at the 1968 peak.
   ``There's no magic in comparing the current inflation-adjusted
price levels with 1968,'' he says. ``It's just a way of
demonstrating that the price appreciation in the stock market for
the last 20 years has probably lagged price appreciation in other
aspects of the economy.''
