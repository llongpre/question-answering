   The stock market's New Year's rally kept rolling yesterday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 2100 for the first time. 

   The industrial average recovered from a loss of more than 18 points yesterday morning to end the session up 25.87 at 2102.50. 
With yesterday's gains, the industrial average has advanced to 11 consecutive records. 
The average also has risen 12 trading days in a row, tying a record set Nov. 19 through Dec. 7, 1970. 

   The blue-chip issues had good company for their rally. 
The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 10.30 to a record 882.51, and the Dow Jones Utility Average moved up 0.52 to a record 223.34. 

   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index both rose to records, too. 
The S&amp;P measure gained 3.06 to 269.34, and the Big Board composite rose 1.50 to 153.71. 

   Traders were impressed by the busy pace of trading despite the closing of the Treasury bond market and many banks and offices to observe Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. 
More than 162.8 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, down from 218.4 million Friday. 
Big Board gainers had a 2-to-1 lead over losers. 

   Traders said the weak opening yesterday reflected sagging prices of Treasury bond futures and pronounced weakness in the U.S. dollar. 
Taking their cue from these developments, profit-takers moved to cash in their chips from the previous 11 gaining sessions. 
But as the bond futures market rebounded on rumors of a possible rate cut by Japan, stocks followed. 
Traders noted that the rally was led by technology stocks. 

   While buy programs linked to arbitrage against stock-index futures provided some demand, "There was steady, continuous institutional buying" throughout the session, too, said Peter Furniss, a vice president in the equity trading department at Smith Barney Harris Upham. 

   "I don't think it's over yet," said Robert Kahan, partner in charge of equity trading at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
The continuing rally is making converts out of many unbelievers, other traders added. 

   The over-the-counter market, which until late last week had been outperforming the bigger stocks in the January trading surge, again fell behind yesterday. 
The Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 2.72, or 0.70%, to 392.59. 
That compares with a 1.25% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

   Traders noted that some of the strong demand for technology stocks yesterday came from some aggressive professionals who had sold borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back at a lower price -- expecting that International Business Machines' fourth-quarter earnings report, due today, would put a damper on this highflying sector. 

   IBM was a favorite stock to sell short in the past few sessions, one trader said. 
But apparently the short-sellers were confounded by those investors who have missed much of this move and were just waiting for a chance to jump into the market. 
Yesterday's early decline was seen as a golden buying opportunity, he said. 

   The rally started with Digital Equipment, up 6 to 143, and Hewlett-Packard, up 4 to 54. 
Other technology stocks later joined, with IBM moving up 5 1/4 to 125 1/4 on more than 2.7 million shares. 
Cray Research soared 7 1/4 to 108 3/4, Honeywell added 1 1/2 to 63 1/2, Unisys gained 3 5/8 to 94 7/8, and Data General rose 1 3/8 to 38 1/4. 

   In the OTC market, Apple Computer gained 4 3/8 to 53 1/8. 
Tandem Computer soared 7 1/4 to 50 after the company reported that its net more than doubled in its first quarter ended Dec. 31. 
Microsoft rose 2 1/4 to 64, Intel added 1 1/2 to 29, and Seagate Technology moved up 3 1/8 to 29 5/8. 

   Among other groups that turned in good performances were stocks of brokerage firms, drug makers, airlines, railroads and chemical makers. 
Issues sensitive to interest rates, such as bank, thrift, utility and insurance stocks, as well as retailing issues, were meager gainers at best. 

   Gold stocks rallied as the dollar sagged in foreign currency markets. 
ASA Ltd. rose 2 1/2 to 42 1/8, Campbell Red Lake moved up 7/8 to 23 1/4, Echo Bay Mines gained 1 1/4 to 27 1/2, and Homestake Mining added 3/4 to 28 3/8. 

   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber rose 1 to 44. 
The company said it expects to receive more than $3 billion from the sale of assets, somewhat higher than anticipated. 
The tire maker could emerge from its restructuring with a stronger than expected balance sheet. 
USX moved up 3/8 to 24 1/4 in active trading. 

   USX has reached a tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union, spelling the end to the longest steel strike in the nation's history. 

   First City Bancorp fell 7/8 to 5 3/4. 
This stock soared Friday on rumors that a foreign bank might be interested in acquiring the bank or providing a capital infusion.
