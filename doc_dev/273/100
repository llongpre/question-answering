   A sharp afternoon selloff wiped out an early
gain in the stock market Thursday, leaving prices little changed
from the day before.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 30 points
at its midsession peak, closed with a 1.99 gain at 1,987.40.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 688 up, 801 down and 501 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 168.44 million shares, against 147.59
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index edged
up .10 to 145.23.
   Analysts said swings in prices of stock-index futures prompted
professionals engaged in program trading to sell the futures and
buy individual stocks in the early going.
   At midafternoon, they said, the balance abruptly reversed and
selling programs hit the stock market.
   Brokers said the effect was especially pronounced because many
other investors have been shying away from the stock market lately,
and thus contributing to its potential volatility.
   They noted that many stocks haven't responded much so far to
generally strong earnings reports for the first quarter.
   For all its erratic behavior, the Dow Jones industrial average
was able to break a three-session losing streak during which it
fell 28.52 points.
   Observers noted, however, that many investors were still in a
very touchy mood a week after the Dow took a 101.46-point drop on
April 14.
   Texas Instruments fell 2} to 46{ in active trading. Analysts
cited disappointment over some aspects of the company's financial
results for the first quarter.
   Among other prominent computer and technology issues, Digital
Equipment dropped 1] to 99|, and International Business Machines
lost { to 112].
   By contrast, Tandy climbed 2| to 45}. The company introduced its
version of a line of IBM personal computers.
   A few issues did benefit from positive earnings reports. For
example, Clark Equipment, which posted a profit in the first
quarter against a loss in the like period a year ago, jumped 2{ to
30].
   Schlumberger added { to 36{ with a boost from sharply higher
quarterly earnings.
   Gillette gained 1{ to 41} as traders awaited the outcome of a
proxy fight between the company and Coniston Partners for four
seats on the Gillette board of directors.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.74 billion, or 0.07
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 194.56 million shares.
   Standard &amp; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose .33 to 298.66,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .29 at 256.42.

dropped 1.04 to 373.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 296.71, down 1.01.
