   Wall Street took some time out Tuesday after
running up a string of sharp gains, but its retreat was milder than
expected and the Dow Jones industrial average still managed to
reach a new closing high.
   Market watchers had anticipated heavy profit-taking after the
Dow Jones average surged more than 176 points in less than two
weeks. But with relatively light selling, ``we had a constructive
day,'' said Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials inched up 0.92 to
2,822.45, just eclipsing the record high of 2,821.53 set on Monday.
The advance brought to 177.40 points the surge in Wall Street's
best-known barometer since April 27.
   The average fluctuated during the day, but the broader market
stayed in negative territory. At the close, declining issues
outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 654 up, 856 down and 505
unchanged.
   Analysts said Wall Street showed continuing signs of strength.
Tuesday's selling was an extension of profit-taking that began
Monday, when the Dow Jones industrials rose 50 points and then fell
back, closing with a 19.95 point gain.
   While Monday's performance raised the specter of heavier losses
Tuesday, ``volume dried up on the downside,'' Jarrett said.
   The stock market's rally in the last two weeks has been
attributed to evidence that inflation is easing, which has sent
interest rates plunging. Last Friday's announcement of the second
straight monthly decline in wholesale prices fed a 91.22 point gain
in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   The market also has been bolstered by the perception that the
Bush administration and Congress are willing to negotiate to reduce
the nation's budget deficit.
   Analysts said the market ignored a government report Tuesday
that industrial production fell 0.4 percent in April, the first
decline since January, but they said there was some concern on Wall
Street about Wednesday's scheduled release of consumer price
figures for April.
   Technology stocks helped lead the market Tuesday. Compaq
Computer jumped 2&lsqb; to 114{, IBM picked up 1&rsqb; to close at 115|, and
Texas Instruments rose 2\ to 39~.
   Retailing stocks were among those hardest hit by profit-takers.
J.C. Penney, which announced a big earnings increase, fell 1&rsqb; to
65\.
   American Express was up 1&rsqb; to 30| amid speculation it was
negotiating to sell its troubled Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
brokerage subsidiary to Primerica.
   Among other blue chip stocks, Philip Morris rose &lsqb; to 44~, AT&amp;T
fell | to 41}, and Boeing slipped 1 to 77.
   Alcan Aluminum, unchanged at 21{, led the NYSE most active list.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.73 million
shares, down from 225.41 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 207.26 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $3.714 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.34 to 193.31.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.76 to 411.86, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was off 0.47 at 354.28.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.89 to 442.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 353.56, down 0.78.
