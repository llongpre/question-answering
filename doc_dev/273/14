   Stock prices advanced sharply and the Dow Jones
industrial average reached a new closing high Tuesday as optimism
about interest rates swept Wall Street in the first session of the
new year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip stocks soared 56.95 to
close at 2,810.15, surpassing its previous closing high of
2,791.41, reached last Oct. 9.
   The closely-watched index surged more than 29 points during the
last half-hour of trading alone, boosted by computerized buying
programs.
   Advancing issues outdistanced decliners by a margin of 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,257 stocks rising, 412 falling and 333 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 162.07 million
shares, up from 145.94 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 193.27 million shares.
   Analysts said economic and technical factors were behind
Tuesday's rally.
   Stocks fell in early trading as investors nervously awaited the
National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly survey of
its members. But after the association reported there was
continuing weakness in the manufacturing economy last month, prices
moved broadly higher.
   The Purchasing Managers Index gained in December, rising to 48
percent from November's 46.6 percent. But it was the eighth
straight month that the purchasing managers have reported weakness
in the industrial sector _ a reading below 50 percent generally
indicates a slowing of the economy _ and it was this fact that
motivated investors.
   Traders believed the continuing weakness would make the Federal
Reserve more likely to nudge interest rates lower.
   Analysts said gains in the dollar also supported the rally on
Wall Street. A stronger dollar gives the Fed more leeway with
interest rates, and it also makes U.S. stocks more attractive to
foreign investors.
   Analysts said there was program trading through much of the
session, especially in the final 30 minutes. However, said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., ``There are real buyers
out there in the marketplace.''
   The stock market benefited from what traders call the ``January
effect'' _ buying by institutional investors who are flush with
cash after liquidating their portfolios at the end of 1989.
   Blue chip issues were at the top of many shopping lists. IBM
jumped 3~ to 98, General Electric rose 2\ to 66}, General Motors
rose 2\ to 44{, and Philip Morris, the most actively-traded issue
on the NYSE, picked up 1&lsqb; to 42}.
   Technology stocks, including IBM, were also big gainers. Digital
Equipment rose 2&lsqb; to 84&lsqb; and Hewlett Packard was up 2&lsqb; to 49&rsqb;.
   Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said that
if the market can continue its gains for a third session _ the Dow
Jones average rose nearly 21 points on Friday _ it will augur well
for Wall Street in the first quarter.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $49.4 billion, or 0.83
percent, in value Tuesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.96 to 198.00.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 7.71 to 411.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 6.29 to 359.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
4.51 to 459.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 381.53, up 3.53.
