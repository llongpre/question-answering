FT  19 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Nasdaq index performs on US recovery
hopes - Big technology stocks have provided a lift to the market's recent
performance

It has been an impressive year for Nasdaq, the second largest stock market
in the US.
By Wednesday, the composite index of Nasdaq stocks had gained 12 per cent
since the beginning of the year, setting several new records in the process.
In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue-chip stocks had risen
only 2.8 per cent over the comparable period, while the Standard &amp; Poor's
500, the broadest measure of market performance, had advanced just 4.0 per
cent.
The Nasdaq's upward climb has seen interruptions, including a prolonged
burst of self-doubt among investors earlier this year, when they began to
question the wisdom of buying small-capitalisation stocks at a time when the
economic recovery appeared to have stagnated.
This produced a sticky patch during the second quarter and the early part of
the third. However, a powerful surge of buying during the autumn more than
wiped out those losses and propelled the index to new highs.
Nasdaq trading has been heavy, and consistently so. The first eleven months
of 1992 were the most active in the market's 21-year history, with a rise of
nearly 16 per cent in the number of shares traded to 43.5bn.
So strong has the demand for Nasdaq stocks been that market volume has often
outstripped that on the New York Stock Exchange, much larger by
capitalisation and established for 180 years longer.
The economic context of the Nasdaq's performance cannot be ignored. All
parts of the stock market have thrived in recent months, primarily because
investors have become increasingly convinced that the economy is heading for
a period of inflation-free growth.
While most on Wall Street expect growth to remain sub-standard compared to
previous post-recessionary periods, it is likely to be more than could have
been hoped for six or eight months ago, when investors despaired of seeing
an end to the 'growth recession' - a long period of anaemic growth coupled
with sustained weakness in the jobs market.
Meanwhile, fresh funds continue to flow into equities, thanks to low
interest rates, which lure money out of low-yielding short-term assets.
The new money has been more than enough to match the supply of fresh stock,
especially shares issued by newly public companies. By the end of October
more than Dollars 11.1bn had been raised on the Nasdaq market from initial
public offerings (IPOs) of stock, compared with Dollars 7.84bn in all of
1991.
Small-capitalisation companies are expected to benefit most from the
recovering economy. 'People are looking for growth, and they're finding it
in small companies,' says Mr David Shulman, chief equity strategist at the
securities house Salomon Brothers.
But a good deal of the composite's recent strength has come from big
technology stocks, which are anything but 'small-cap'. Three in particular,
Microsoft, MCI Communications and Intel, have done very well lately.
Microsoft is up almost 20 per cent on the year and MCI up 25 per cent.
Intel, which this week told investors that its fourth quarter earnings would
come in 25 per cent higher than the Dollars 1.43bn earned in the third
quarter, is up a staggering 73 per cent.
Why do these three stand out? 'They are all on the right side of the
technology wars,' says an analyst.
On the wrong side of the technology wars is IBM. Its dreadful performance in
1992 (it is currently down almost 50 per cent from its year-high) has, along
with another troubled giant of US industry, General Motors, artificially
depressed both the Dow and the S &amp; P 500.
Other measures of small-cap stock performance show that the secondary market
is thriving. The Russell 2000 index of small companies, for example, is
currently up 26 per cent from the end of 1991.
Even relatively high p/e ratios have failed to scare off buyers. The Russell
2000 may be trading at 24 times past earnings and the Nasdaq composite at 35
times earnings, but investors continue to buy, primarily because they are
focusing on the future. While the earnings outlook is good, some analysts
warn that Nasdaq stocks may be in for a technical correction over the New
Year, given the market's powerful performance in the closing months of 1992.
The more distant future, however, looks more positive. As Mr Shulman says of
the Nasdaq: 'Long term, that's where the growth in the economy will be.'
In the first 12 months of the two previous new, change-oriented Democratic
presidents (John F Kennedy in 1961 and Jimmy Carter in 1977) smaller
companies did much better than larger companies.
No one is quite sure why, but the soothsayers are not ruling out a repeat
under President-elect Bill Clinton. Moreover, there may be genuine reasons
to expect small stocks to benefit from a Clinton administration. Several of
the economic proposals in his campaign policy package were aimed at making
life easier for small companies, most notably his pledge to cut capital
gains taxes on small businesses.
