This may not necessarily be a good thing, but some Wall Street sages have
been pointing out lately that conditions in the US stock market are
currently as near to perfect as is possible.
The economy is growing at a solid pace. Inflation, primarily because of the
moderate rate of economic growth, is unthreatening. Interest rates, although
edging higher, are still near historic lows. Company earnings continue to
improve, thanks in part to vigorous cost containment measures and efficiency
gains, and Corporate America's balance sheet is as healthy as it has been
for a long time.
Even the dollar is perking up, which may not be good for US exporters trying
to sell their goods abroad, but it does at least attract capital to US
financial markets.
Moreover, the poor recent performance of some of last year's hottest foreign
stock markets - notably Mexico and Hong Kong - is also working in the US
market's favour, as it may cool investors' ardour for overseas equities and
persuade them to keep more of their money at home.
Also, there are few signs that the individual investor is losing interest in
the stock market.
Investment managers report that money continues to flood into mutual funds,
money that the institutions have been quickly putting to use by investing in
equities, particularly the stocks of companies whose earnings are closely
tied to the economic cycle.
The cash inflows from funds, coupled with the mood of optimism about the
economy and corporate earnings, has been behind the stock market's
impressive performance in the first two weeks of 1994.
Apart from a few days of profit-taking, share prices have been appreciating
steadily since the New Year. In the first six days of January alone the Dow
Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 100 points, or almost 3 per cent,
as the Dow broke through 3,800 for the first time.
Several days of modest selling earlier this week did little to damp the
market's fire, and yesterday the buying resumed. By late morning the Dow was
up another 25 points, all but erasing the previous three day's losses.
More and more analysts are now talking of the Dow reaching 4,000 within a
few months, and some are even suggesting it will make 4,500 before the year
is out.
Yet, the skies above the stock market are not entirely cloud-free.
The Dow may have started the year in grand style, but other indices have
lagged behind. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite and the
Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks have performed only half as well
as the Dow.
This suggests that investors' confidence in the market is not particularly
broad-based.
Then there is the matter of equity valuations. Stocks on the S&amp;P 500 are
currently trading at about 23-times past earnings, and paying out a dividend
yield of 2.6 per cent. Those figures are both well off historic averages,
which are about 14-times earnings and a 4.4 per cent dividend yield. The
bears in the market say it is only a matter of time before valuations start
coming back toward historic averages, and that is more likely to happen as a
result of a sharp decline in share prices, rather than a dramatic
improvement in earnings performance.
Finally, the threat of inflation still hovers in the distance. While the
current inflation rate is low - figures released this week showed that
consumer prices rose last year by 2.7 per cent, the best inflation
performance since 1986 - investors in fixed-income assets such as government
securities remain concerned that the steadily accelerating pace of economic
growth will eventually feed through into higher prices, and start eroding
the value of their investments.
That concern pushed bond yields higher in the latter half of this week.
After falling to as low as 6.18 per cent on Wednesday, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond had moved back up to 6.3 per cent by midday
yesterday, spooked by an unexpectedly strong December retail sales report.
What is more, the stock market's own inflation warning bell - the Dow Jones
Utilities Average - has been ringing recently. The average of 15 utilities
stocks has fallen 3.7 per cent since the start of the year. Utility stocks
are uniquely sensitive to inflationary trends, because when inflation rises,
utility companies' earnings suffer because their ability to put up their
rates to counter the impact of inflation is restricted by the government.
This is not to suggest that a big correction in share prices is imminent,
only to note that conditions in the stock market are rarely, if ever,
perfect.
