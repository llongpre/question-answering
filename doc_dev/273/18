   Stock prices drifted lower yesterday in a continuing lackluster trading environment, a sharp contrast with the one that produced several major stock index records last week. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.36 points to 1916.90 in a moderately active session. 
A week before, the industrial average skyrocketed more than 43 points to a record 1955.57 on booming volume that exceeded yesterday's by more than 100 million shares. 
The average has moved lower in all but one of the succeeding five sessions. 

   The broader averages also slipped. 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.88 to 249.28, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.02 to 142.57. 
Decliners had a 2-to-1 lead over advancers on the Big Board as volume contracted to 128.7 million shares from 159 million Monday. 

   Traders complained that the stock market lacked leadership from bonds and that they didn't see much buying demand from investors. 
One trader at a New York-based brokerage firm said there was so little liquidity in the market that he had difficulty completing some trades. 

   "If you have a hot tape, (investors) want to do some business. 
But if you have a dull tape, (investors) don't want to do any business," said Gerald Simmons, a managing director in the equity trading department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. 

   He added that "there are more than 1,000 institutions, but all the active ones seemed to be active at the same time," notably last week. 

   Philip Erlanger, a technical analyst with Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn., said that while the Dow Jones industrial and transportation averages set new highs last week, the aggregate number of net advancing issues has been declining since April. 
He takes this as a sign of weakness for the stock market, and this divergence is seen in the laggard performance of the smaller-capitalization stocks compared with the blue-chip issues. 

   Given this divergence, last Tuesday's rally might have just extended the Dow Jones Industrial Average's current trading range, instead of constituting a breakthrough, Mr. Erlanger said. 
Further advances may be phantoms, he indicated. 
"We could see (the average hit) 2000 this year. 
People will get excited, and then they will be disappointed." 
Without an increasing number of advancing issues, he doesn't see enough strength in the stock market to keep the industrial average above 2000. 

   Secondary stocks weakened yesterday along with the blue-chip stocks. 

   In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite fell 1.98 to 359.03 as volume expanded to 116.3 million shares from 110.6 million Monday. 
There were 874 issues showing price advances and 1,366 declining. 

   The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index dropped 1.42 to 265.36. 

   Some investors seemed far more eager to take profits than buy stocks yesterday. 
Traders said they saw selling of some cyclical issues, such as chemical, forest product and paper stocks. 

   International Paper fell 1 to 76 7/8, Kimberly-Clark dropped 1 1/8 to 85 1/8, Boise Cascade declined 1 1/4 to 61 3/4, Dow Chemical slid 1 to 60 1/4, Allied-Signal eased 3/8 to 42 1/2, and Du Pont lost 5/8 to 89. 

   The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 12.21 to 841.48. 
Among the decliners in this group, Burlington Northern fell 1 1/2 to 58 7/8, Union Pacific dropped 1 1/4 to 64 3/8, Norfolk Southern lost 7/8 to 85 5/8, AMR slid 1 to 55 7/8, UAL declined 5/8 to 58 7/8, and Federal Express eased 3/8 to 69. 

   USAir tumbled 2 3/8 to 36 1/8. 
Monday, the company agreed to acquire Pacific Southwest Airlines from PS Group for about $400 million. 
The merger would create the seventh-largest domestic airline, but it might be opposed by PSA's employees and unions. 
PSA eased 1/8 to 15 7/8 in OTC trading, while PS Group rose 1/4 to 36 1/2 on the Big Board. 

   Carter Hawley Hale rose 1 to 48 1/2 after falling 5 7/8 points Monday. 
In fighting off an unwanted takeover bid, the retailer announced a restructuring that would spin off its prized specialty stores to existing shareholders, along with a cash payment to holders of $325 million. 
General Cinema, which bought 3.6 million Carter Hawley shares yesterday and now has a 49.1% stake, will have a 44% voting stake in the new specialty store company. 
General Cinema's stock rose 1/2 to 45 1/2. 

   United Technologies rose 3/8 to 45 5/8. 
The company said it expects to report a substantial loss for the fourth quarter because of a corporate restructuring and employee severance plans that will require pre-tax charges of about $592 million. 
But United Technologies expects to report a profit for the full year. 

   Lockheed fell 1 3/4 to 51 3/4. 
The company adopted a "poison pill" shareholder rights plan, but said the move wasn't in response to any effort to acquire control of Lockheed. 

   Ponderosa rose 1/4 to 26 5/8. 
The company's board recommended that shareholders not accept a tender offer by a group led by New York investor Asher Edelman for $27.50 a share. 

   Atlantic Research rose 5 1/4 to 30 3/4 in the OTC market. 
Late Monday, Clabir and its General Defense Corp. unit said they had bought a 7.4% stake in Atlantic Research and are interested in acquiring the rest of the company. 

   Culbro moved up 2 to 52 1/4 in light trading. 
The company announced a special distribution to shareholders of $12.84 a share. 

   Joy Manufacturing fell 1/2 to 31 1/4. 
The company filed a suit in an attempt to block a $31-a-share tender offer by Pullman-Peabody. 
Joy rejected that tender offer Monday. 
Pullman-Peabody was up 1/4 at 7 7/8. 

   British Gas American depositary shares eased 1/4 to 8 7/8 in continued active trading on the Big Board. 
The initial leg of the American depositary share offering, part of the huge initial offering of Britain's formerly state-owned natural-gas utility, had been priced at $7.11 a share in New York Monday. 

   BankAmerica rose 3/8 to 15 in active trading. 
First Interstate asked the Federal Reserve to clear its unsolicited takeover bid for BankAmerica.
