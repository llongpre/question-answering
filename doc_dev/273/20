WHAT IS wrong with small stocks? While the Dow Jones industrials and the
broad market S&amp;P indices have hovered around record highs, indicators of
smaller stocks have displayed a marked under-performance in recent months.
Since posting a record high of 644.92 on February 12, the Nasdaq composite
index of over-the-counter stocks, which includes a lot of small-sized
companies, has fallen just over 9 per cent, closing at 587.16 on Thursday.
Over the same period the even broader Russell 2000 index of
small-capitalised stocks has dropped about 7 per cent from the mid-February
high of 212, while the Value Line Index of small caps has given up almost as
much of its gains.
Analysts have been saying the same thing in recent weeks: small stocks are
taking a beating because they were driven too high last year by speculative
buying that lost touch with their underlying earnings potential.
The damage inflicted on some of the high-flyers of six months to a year ago
has been remarkable. Biotechnology and healthcare stocks have been hit the
hardest, primarily because they enjoyed so much of the attention in the
record-breaking rally of 1991.
Immunex is a typical example. In January the maker of immunological
biological products was trading around Dollars 60; by the end of April it
had fallen to Dollars 26.
Over the same period Cytogen, which produces biochemical systems for
treating cancer, dropped from Dollars 34 to Dollars 17, while the value of
shares in another anti-cancer drug maker, Immunogen, was more than halved to
Dollars 12.
Probably the biggest blow to the biotech sector was administered last month
when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to grant approval for
Centoxin, a drug for treating septic shock produced by Centocor, whose stock
plunged from its high this year of Dollars 60 to Dollars 12 on news of the
decision.
Analysts had talked of potential sales of about Dollars 1bn for Centoxin,
and the FDA's refusal to approve it was a big blow not just to Centocor, but
to the entire sector, as expectations that other drugs would be approved
were dashed by talk that the FDA was taking a tougher line.
Centocor's problems highlight the risks investors face when buying stock in
biotech companies whose future may rest on one product, or an awaited
scientific breakthrough.
The fast-growth biotech stocks were particular favourites of new investors,
who read of the extraordinary gains to be earned in the sector and jumped on
the bandwagon with little thought or research. As a result, many bought
stocks in companies they knew little about. As soon as the sector's
speculative bubble burst in mid-February, many of the unsophisticated
investors panicked and sold hurriedly.
At the same time the more experienced investors were getting out because
price/earnings ratios and technical charts were telling them that the sector
had peaked and was heading for a substantial correction.
Healthcare stocks also ran into heavy selling during the latter part of the
first quarter, with analysts blaming the losses on the uncertainty
surrounding healthcare legislation in this election year.
Health has been one of the biggest topics in the presidential debate so far,
and there is concern in the market that after the election the victorious
candidate might push sweeping health reforms through Congress.
The problems of the biotech and healthcare sectors has inevitably impacted
on the market for initial public offerings (IPOs). Between January 1991 and
the end of the first quarter this year an estimated Dollars 1.75bn was
raised through over 50 biotech IPOs as new and emerging companies rushed to
take advantage of the heavy demand from investors for biotech stocks. But in
recent weeks several planned IPOs have been shelved because of the sudden
absence of buyers.
The under-performance of small stock indices has also been caused by a
switch of funds into low-priced cyclical stocks. The high p/e ratios on many
growth stocks in the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 at the start of
the year had set off alarm bells for some investors, who began selling out
of small growth stocks and into cyclical broader market stocks.
To investors, the recovering economy made cyclicals, whose earnings tend to
move in line with the economic cycle, look more attractive than emerging
growth stocks, whose earnings are more unreliable.
As for small value stocks, which can look slow and unexciting but which
usually produce a steady return over the long term, they offer a safe haven
with strong defensive qualities for investors tired of the roller-coaster
ride of biotechs.
