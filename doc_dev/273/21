<TEXT>     Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president with First Albany, said the market
move was surprising, since news of a 2.4 percent rise in the gross national
product at an annual rate and later the Conference Board's report of an
unexpectedly sharp decline in its consumer confidence index, was deeply
troubling.;   The stock market's normal response to the data was evident in
the morning, when it dropped, Johnson noted.;   After the decline, prices rose
until a small retreat late in the day.;   Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange was heavy at 192.8 million shares, up from 161.6 million Monday.;  
Rising issues outpaced losers 1,031 to 610.;   The Big Board composite index
rose 1.14 to 215.58, while the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.96
to 391.48. Trading on the American Stock Exchange pushed the composite up 2.32
to 381.61.;   In heavy over-the-counter trading, the NASDAQ composite rose
5.10 to 534.51, and the Russell 2000 index, another indicator of small
companies, rose 1.16 to 181.90.;   Among the notable issues Tuesday, Xoma rose
1 1/2 to 19 1/2 after a federal court jury upheld its patent on a drug to
treat a deadly bacterial infection. The company's rival, Centocor, which the
jury said infringed Xoma's patent, fell 1 1/4 to 49, but traders said Centocor
believes the verdict will not affect its introduction of a similar drug.;  
Genzyme, a health care products company, rose 1 3/4 to 49 5/8, after analysts
at Shearson Lehman repeated a "buy" recommendation.; LOCAL STOCKS; ...; UP;
