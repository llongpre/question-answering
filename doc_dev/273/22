FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: Dow surges on while others languish - Wall Street

The good economic news keeps coming, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
keeps setting new record highs, but anxiety on Wall Street about the
condition of equity markets continues to cast a shadow over the final weeks
of 1993.
The economic fundamentals remain positive, with this week's statistics
suggesting that growth is steadily accelerating. Industrial production in
November rose 0.9 per cent, a stronger than expected gain and the six
straight monthly increase in the output numbers. Also, housing starts rose
3.9 per cent last month, weekly unemployment claims fell in early December,
and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that manufacturing activity in
its region has been extremely robust lately.
This array of confidence-boosting data propelled the Dow to an all-time high
of 3,764.43 on Monday. That, however, was not as impressive as it looked.
Gains in just two stocks - IBM and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing -
accounted for almost half of the day's 24-point gain, and three other
stocks, Alcoa, International Paper and Du Pont, contributed the rest.
Moreover, while the Dow was reaching new highs, the rest of the market was
languishing. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a much broader measure of market
performance, rose less than two points on Monday and remained below its
record peak, while the Nasdaq composite index fell.
This divergence between the large-capitalised stocks that make up the Dow
and the rest of the market - in particular the indices that track the
performance the shares of small-and medium-sized companies - is cause for
concern among analysts. Some believe that the market has been undergoing a
corrective phase for the past two months, but that it has escaped almost
everyone's notice because the Dow has performed so well.
Since mid-October, the Dow has climbed 3 per cent, and regularly moved into
previously unexplored territory. Yet, over the same period, the S &amp; P 500
has fallen about 1 per cent, the Nasdaq composite almost 4 per cent, and the
Russell 2000 index 3.5 per cent. All three remain below their all-time
highs. In the past, when the Dow has continued to rally to peaks while
other, broader indices have lagged, it has been the sign of an exhausted
bull market.
The weakness in secondary stocks has taken its toll on the market for
initial public offerings, or company flotations. This week several IPOs of
small, growth-oriented companies were postponed at the last minute, with
underwriters citing 'unfavourable market conditions' as the reason for the
hasty withdrawal.
Although a rash of pulled IPOs might be viewed as evidence that the market
has overreached itself (the theory being that conditions in the IPO market
have deteriorated because investor accounts, already full-to-the-brim with
new stock, are being much choosier about which new issues they should buy),
there may be another explanation for all the postponements.
The underwriting calendar, which is normally quiet at this time of the year,
has remained unusually active this month, and underwriters are finding that
there are simply too many IPOs for investors to handle. So companies have
been shelving flotation plans, but most will probably return to the market
in early 1994, when they expect demand from investors to remain strong.
If a deterioration in the IPO market is not on the cards, what might be
lurking around the next corner that could trigger the sharp correction in
the Dow that the weakness in secondary stocks has suggested may be imminent?
Perhaps a foreign political crisis? Although the Dow set a record high on
Monday, it fell 50 points in the next two sessions, and traders blamed the
losses on nervousness about the situation in Russia, where
ultra-nationalists won a large share of the vote in last weekend's
parliamentary elections.
The nationalist party's leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, has pledged to rebuild
Russia's armed forces, has talked of reviving the nation's expansionist
ambitions and has made threatening comments about Russia's neighbours. This
kind of talk makes US investors nervous, even if the far right in Russia is
unlikely to hold the reins of power in the new parliament.
And if developments in Russia do not trigger a panic, the situation in North
Korea, which continues to make belligerent noises about South Korea, could,
if it deteriorates any further, prove sufficiently disturbing to set off a
stampede of selling. This may not be a particularly festive thought, but for
the stock market Christmas has often been the season - the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, the start of the Iran-Iraq war - of nasty external shocks.
