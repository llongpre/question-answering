   A late buying wave buoyed stock prices, carrying
the Dow Jones industrial average to another record, while broader
market measures also moved to new highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.00 to 2,743.36,
surpassing the previous peak reached last week.
   The stock market meandered mostly at lower levels in lethargic
activity during much of a session marked by several rounds of
futures-related buying programs.
   Initially, the market appeared to be continuing the downward
trend that developed Friday after the rally on Thursday when the Dow
Jones industrial average surged about 56{ points to 2,734.64,
exceeding the record posted in August 1987.
   Several rebounds linked to program trading failed to spark a
sustained rally before renewed buying going into the final half hour
of the session generated fresh buying interest.
   In the late going, advancing issues took the lead from declines
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks and
760 issues went up in price while 692 fell and 537 were unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board slowed to 131.18 million
shares, down from 165.93 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 157.21 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts say trading volume will probably remain
fairly light this week ahead of the long Labor Day weekend.
   Also, analysts say investors are likely to be reluctant to trade
heavily before the release of several potentially market-moving
economic reports due later this week.
   Among the data expected to cast some additional light on economic
conditions are the August unemployment report and the index of
leading economic indicators, both due Friday.
   Takeover speculation continued to draw investors to airline
stocks and helped push the Dow Jones average of 20 transportation
issues to its third straight record close. It rose 24.90 to 1,492.89.
   UAL gained 3{ to 281{. A change in ownership of the parent of
United Airlines was said to be imminent.
   Among other airline stocks, AMR, owner of American Airlines, rose
2[ to 81\, Delta went up 2} to 80{ and Southwest Airlines gained 1[
to 27{.
   Texas Air rose 1[ to 22 in American Stock Exchange trading. There
were reports that Scandinavian Airlines System and an unidentified
partner were interested in acquiring all or part of Texas Air-owned
Continental Airlines.
   Meanwhile, W.R. Grace jumped 1] to 37[, responding to a USA Today
article which said several brokerage houses have accumulated Grace
shares for an unidentified client. The company said it was unaware
of any group buying up its shares.
   Texaco, which fell \ to 53{, led the Big Board's list of active
shares as more than 6.5 million shares changed hands.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines rose 1~ to
118, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose \ to 40[, General Motors
was unchanged at 47~ and USX gained } to 35\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $11.52 billion, or 0.34
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.66 to 195.45, exceeding its previous record close of 195.29 posted
Aug. 24.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.74 to 403.53, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index went up 1.57 to 352.09, also a new high.
