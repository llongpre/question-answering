   Stock prices rallied late yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest level since early January. 

   The industrial average, after meandering in a narrow range for most of the session, perked up in the final 90 minutes and gained 25.70 points to 2040.29. 
Demand for some cyclical stocks, some program trades and an uptick in the bond market were the main factors. 

   Yesterday's gain, following an advance of nearly 29 points Friday, still left the industrial average below its post-crash high of 2051.89, set Jan. 7. 

   Some other market barometers, such as the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Nasdaq composite index in the over-the-counter market, have set new post-crash highs in recent weeks. 
Yesterday, the transportation average rose 6.52 to 822.06 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.86 to 359.98. 

   Technical analysts, who study historical price and volume charts for clues on the market's future direction, now are focusing on the 2050 level to see if the advance continues or falters. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed over 2000 several times since the October crash, but on each occasion sellers have rushed in and the average has quickly retreated. 

   Dan Marciano, head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said widespread adoption of a level, such as 2050, as a major resistance point "could become something of a self-fulfilling prophecy." 
With all the attention focused on this level, he explained, some investors and portfolio managers may be waiting to sell when the average reaches it. 

   Some traders said that afternoon news about the federal government running a budget surplus last month propped up the bond market and may have spilled over into equities. 
Bond investors are usually cheered by any development that could lead to some shrinking in the massive federal budget and less Treasury financing. 

   Stock prices also were affected by several buy programs, linked to various strategies using stock-index futures, traders noted. 

   And even before the late advance, some traders were writing up buy orders for some cyclical stocks in such industries as chemicals, technology and forest products and paper. 
Demand for these issues came despite still-muddled signals about the post-crash health of the economy. 

   For instance, Dow Chemical rose 2 1/8 to 87 1/8; Du Pont climbed 1 3/8 to 86 3/8; American Cyanamid gained 2 5/8 to 47 1/2; Allied-Signal added 3/8 to 33 1/4; International Paper advanced 1 5/8 to 43 1/2; Kimberly Clark moved up 2 1/4 to 55 7/8; and Champion International increased 1 7/8 to 35 1/2. 

   In the technology sector, Digital Equipment rose 5 1/4 to 125 7/8; International Business Machines moved up 1 7/8 to 115 1/4; Compaq Computer added 7/8 to 47 3/4. 
In OTC trading, Apple Computer gained 1 1/2 to 43 1/4. 
Semiconductor stocks, such as Motorola, Intel, National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments and Advanced Micro Devices, also rose. 

   Larry Borgman, who follows the semiconductor industry at Nomura Securities, told clients there could be short-term trading opportunities in both Motorola and Intel, which trades in the OTC market. 
He added that many of these issues were battered early last month when many investors were extremely worried about a recession. 

   Although the economic outlook is far from certain, Mr. Borgman said order levels at most semiconductor makers have been steady in January and so far this month. 

   Eastman Kodak sank 1 1/2 to 40 3/4 on more than 2.5 million shares. 
Wall Street analysts and investors were surprised by the $5.7 billion in lost profits and interest that Polaroid is asking for patent-infringement damages. 

   Polaroid's huge request could bring about a downgrading of Kodak's debt and complicate its planned $5.1 billion acquisition of Sterling Drug, analysts said. 
Polaroid climbed 2 1/2 to 30. 

   Kodak also disclosed flaws that lower the supposed 10-year life of its Ultralife nine-volt batteries. 
Black &amp; Decker, one of Kodak's largest battery customers, is pulling thousands of flashlights from stores and stopping shipment of a new line of smoke detectors that carried the battery. 
However, Black &amp; Decker's stock wasn't damaged by the news; it added 1/2 to 19 1/2. 

   Manufacturers Hanover jumped 2 1/4 to 25 3/4 on heavy volume on rumors that Deutsche Bank AG of West Germany is considering a bid for the New York-based bank. 
Manufacturers Hanover said it didn't know of any bid, and a source close to Deutsche Bank said he doubted the rumor "had any substance." 
L.F. Rothschild Holdings sank 7/8 to 3. 
The brokerage and investment banking firm, which reported a fourth-quarter loss of $128.8 million, agreed to merge with a unit of Franklin Savings Corp., a closely held concern. 

   Dominion Resources was unchanged at 44 3/4 on 4.2 million shares; Sonat, the most active issue, rose 1/8 to 30 1/4 on 4.5 million shares, and Kansas City Power &amp; Light was unchanged at 28 1/2 on 2.1 million shares. 

   Dividend-capture strategies accounted for the activity in these stocks, since they carry dividend yields ranging from 6.6% to 7.8%. 

   Thermedics moved up 1 3/8, or 17%, to 9 1/2, making it the biggest percentage gainer on the American Stock Exchange. 
The stock of this biomedical concern was recommended by Value Line late last week. 
The company recently signed an exclusive marketing agreement with a Baxter Travenol unit, and its artificial heart is getting more recognition. 

   Primerica added 1 1/8 to 29 3/8. 
The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported that Primerica Chairman Gerald Tsai may be considering taking the company private and that its brokerage unit, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., acquired last year, might be up for sale. 

   Software AG Systems leaped 2 5/8 to 11 1/8 in the OTC market. 
Software AG of Darmstadt, West Germany, launched an $11.50-a-share cash tender offer for the Reston, Va., maker of computer system software packages. 

   Chi-Chi's moved up 3/4 to 9 3/4 in OTC trading after Foodmaker Inc. agreed to acquire the Mexican restaurant chain, based in Louisville, Ky., for $10.15 a share, or about $230 million. 
Foodmaker was unchanged at 11 1/2 on the Big Board. 

   Monsanto fell 3/4 to 89. 
The chemical concern sold its Astroturf Industries unit to Balsam Sportstattenbau G.m.b.H. of Steinhagen, West Germany. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Orion Pictures rose 3/8 to 17 3/4. 
Late Friday, an investor group headed by Metromedia said it was seeking government permission to raise its stake in Orion to as much as 50% from the current 28.3%. 
Another group, led by Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom and National Amusements, has a stake in Orion. 

   Lockheed gained 4 3/8 to 44 7/8 in active trading. 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. raised its rating on the stock and cited takeover possibilities for the company. 

   Interest in takeover stocks continued. 
Federated Department Stores moved up 1/2 to 60 3/4; Mohasco gained 1/4 to 25 1/8; and J.P. Stevens added 3/4 to 46 1/8. 
Stop &amp; Shop, which is being pursued by Dart Group, rose 1 1/8 to 39; the retailer reported higher fourth-quarter net. 

   Grumman inched up 1/8 to 19 1/8. 
The company reached an out-of-court settlement with the New York City Transit Authority over the agency's longstanding suit concerning 851 Grumman buses purchased by the authority. 
Grumman agreed to pay $40 million over the next five years. 
The company also reported a fourth-quarter loss.
