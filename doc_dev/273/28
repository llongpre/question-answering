   So much for milestones. 

   The Nasdaq Composite Index surpassed its record closing level during yesterday's trading. 
But investors in the over-the-counter market, the home of small stocks, were unimpressed. 

   Traders and analysts say the indifferent response reflects small investors' continued coolness to stocks in general and smaller issues in particular. 
Since the October 1987 stock market crash, "the public has never sincerely embraced small stocks," says Cuyler Kline, managing director of the OTC trading department at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. 
"They've come back into the safety zone" of large-capitalization, big-name issues, he says. 

   The Nasdaq Composite, which tracks about 5,200 OTC stocks, jumped as high as 455.50 before closing at 453.29, down 0.55. 
On Aug. 26, 1987, the composite finished at 455.26, establishing the record that investors flirted with yesterday. 

   Although the Nasdaq composite outgained the New York Stock Exchange composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1988, small stocks trailed larger issues during the 1982-87 bull market. 
So far this year, despite efforts by securities companies including Shearson Lehman Hutton, PaineWebber, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to convince investors that small stocks are seriously undervalued, investors remain largely uninterested. 

   After outgaining the Big Board composite index, the Dow Jones industrials and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index in the first five months of this year, the Nasdaq composite ran out of steam and now trails them all. 
The Nasdaq composite is up 18.8% since Dec. 31, while the Big Board composite has jumped 22.5%, the Dow Jones industrials have advanced 21.8%, and the S&amp;P 500 has surged 23.9%. 

   While the Nasdaq composite is still struggling to establish a high, the American Stock Exchange hit a new peak in June, and the S&amp;P 500 set a new record level last Wednesday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still nearly 100 points from its record of 2722.42. 

   Many individual investors are just buying bigger stocks or investing in mutual funds, but some are just plain leery of stocks. 
Those investors are clinging to money-market securities, which are perceived as having less risk, analysts and traders say. 

   "I still don't think the public is convinced that we're in a bull market," says Robert Dickey, technical analyst at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. 
The consensus opinion of individual investors is that the market "is just running up to the same level from which it crashed" and is likely to fall again, he says. 

   Some officials at securities firms that trade OTC stocks were anticipating the round of selling that occurred yesterday. 
Even though interest rates are coming down and many economists say inflation is under control, "the market seems overpriced and ahead of itself to many investors," says Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
"Some people are selling into the strength, and that's holding the market back." 

   "We've had a major-league run-up," says E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of big OTC market maker Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc. 
"I still feel okay (about the OTC market), but you've got to be selective now about what you buy." 

   What's more, the market for initial public stock offerings, which drew investor attention to the OTC market in the past, hasn't regained its pre-crash robustness, Mr. Dickey says. 

   Also holding the market back these days are its blue-chip-caliber issues, the technology stocks. 
Such large-capitalization OTC stocks as Apple Computer, Intel, Ashton-Tate, Seagate Technology and Sun Microsystems have been battered by investors responding to disappointing earnings reports and talk that the computer industry is headed for a slowdown. 
Yesterday, many of those issues continued to ease. 
Intel fell 1 1/4 to 29 1/4, Ashton-Tate was off 1/8 to 15, Seagate declined 1/8 to 11 1/2, and Sun Microsystems dropped 5/8 to 13 7/8. 
Apple Computer was up 1/8 to 39 7/8. 

   Still, many analysts and traders remain optimistic. 
Mr. DaPuzzo expects institutional investors to begin committing more cash to OTC stocks soon, and he says Shearson is anticipating a new round of stock-buying by individuals who can no longer get double-digit returns on moneymarket securities now that interest rates are falling. 

   Mr. Dickey also doesn't expect the negative sentiment on stocks to persist. 
"I can feel the shift taking place," he says. 
"It's not anywhere close to a frenzy, but it's building." 
Mr. Kline says: "Despite the Nasdaq Composite's doldrums, there is strong interest in stocks; sooner or later, everything will join in." 

   The OTC market's largest nonfinancial stocks, including the technology issues, dragged it down yesterday. 
The Nasdaq 100 Index of big nonfinancials tumbled 2.88 to 425.67, while the Nasdaq Financial Index of large banking and insurance issues rose 1.81 to 448.20. 
Among broader Nasdaq industry indexes, banking, other financial and transportation stocks were higher. 
The industrial and utility issues finished lower. 

   One giant utility-index stock, MCI Communications, fell 1 1/4 to 39. 
It was Nasdaq's most active stock. 
MCI said it reduced its basic interstate long-distance rates by about $12 million annually by lowering rates an average of 1.5%, effective immediately. 
Specifically, MCI is reducing some residential rates by an average of 1.9%, business and commercial rates by an average of 0.4% and MCI Card rates by 1%. 

   Joseph Bellace, a Merrill Lynch analyst who last week downgraded his view of MCI's stock to "neutral" from "above average," reinstated his previous rating, other analysts said. 
Mr. Bellace couldn't be reached to confirm the reports. 

   Warwick Insurance Managers slid 25% and was the biggest percentage loser of the day after the company said it expects to report a loss of at least $7 million for the second quarter. 
Warwick Insurance closed at 3, down 1. 

   Class A shares of Figgie International soared 6 to 75. 
The Class B shares rose 3 to 82. 
The Willoughby, Ohio, maker of industrial and consumer products said it will hold a Dutch auction to buy as many as 437,811 of its Class A common shares at a price of $74 to $84 a share and as many as 162,189 Class B common shares at $83 to $94 a share. 

   Dunkin' Donuts was unchanged at 37 3/4 on news that only 23.5% of its shares had been tendered as of last Thursday under DD Acquisition's unsolicited tender offer for the doughnut maker. 

   Micropolis, a maker of high-capacity disk drives, closed up 1/2 at 3 3/4 after a Kidder Peabody analyst issued a buy recommendation on the stock. 
The company's chief executive officer said Micropolis might report a profit in the first quarter of 1990, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 
Micropolis has had four consecutive quarters of losses and expects to report losses in the third and fourth quarters of 1989, the news service said. 

   In the second quarter, Micropolis had a loss of $10.6 million. 
It had net income of $1.2 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier.
