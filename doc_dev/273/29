   Unexpected news of an increase in the nation's
trade deficit touched off a freefall slide in the stock market
Thursday, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average with its second
three-digit loss this year.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips plunged 101.46 to 2,005.64,
for its largest loss since it fell 140.58 on Jan. 8 and its fifth
biggest point drop ever.
   Declining issues overpowered advances by about 11 to 1 in the
overall tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 144 up, 1,601
down and 248 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 211.81 million shares, against 185.12
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index fell
6.06 to 147.14.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in February
from $12.44 billion the month before.
   That came as a shock to market participants, who had been
looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between imports and
exports.
   The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the
news, and U.S. credit markets also took the news badly.
   Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell more than $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8.9 percent
range. Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as
about 8.3 percent.
   Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in
particular, raised fears that the Federal Reserve might soon feel
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to
support the dollar.
   ``You got a nasty bit of news,'' said Larry Wachtel at
Prudential-Bache Securities. ``The market is saying that the
economy is too strong.''
   The decline in the Dow reached 50 points at midafternoon,
activating for the second-time the ``collar'' set up by the New
York Stock Exchange in early February. At that point the exchange
asked its member firms not to use its main computerized trading
system for program trading.
   But prices kept falling. Analysts noted that the Dow had climbed
nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on
anticipation of favorable trade news. This morning's report, they
said, effectively wiped out the basis for that rally.
   Multipoint losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 7|
at 159|; International Business Machines, down 4} at 111];
Coca-Cola, down 2\ at 37}; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 4~ at 77~, and
General Motors, down 3} at 71|.
   Digital Equipment, which reported approximately flat
first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, lost 5\ to 103[.
   One of the few issues that bucked the downtrend was Resorts
International class A shares, up 3[ at 31] in American Stock
Exchange trading. Donald Trump and Merv Griffin, who have been
battling for control of the company, reached an agreement that
would ultimately give holders other than Trump $36 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $99.69 billion, or 3.70
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 247.33 million shares.
   Standard &amp; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 14.17 to 302.34,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 11.82 at 259.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 8.89 to 374.52. At the Amex, the market value index closed
at 298.92, down 6.87.
