   Stock prices edged higher, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to another record, but the stock market's explosive rally was tempered by profit-taking yesterday. 

   The industrial average ended the session up 3.51 at 1974.83, surpassing the record it set the previous day. 
At the opening bell, it appeared the rally might continue at the brisk pace seen Monday as demand from institutional investors in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Japan pushed up prices. 

   Traders said that although buyers were evident in the stock market, it was inevitable that some investors would cash in their chips from the rally that got under way with the new year. 
"The market had to take a breather" after gaining nearly 80 points since Friday, said Donald Crooks, senior equity trader at Morgan Stanley in New York. 

   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.59 to 252.78, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.42 to 144.81. 
These two market barometers haven't yet reached the records they established last December and September, respectively. 

   Volume was slightly stronger, but gainers on the Big Board didn't have the overwhelming lead seen Monday. 
Yesterday, 972 issues advanced and 699 declined. 
Volume rose to 189.3 million shares from 181.9 million. 

   A pause in the rally is expected, and many traders and analysts expect it to occur soon, about the time the Dow Jones Industrial Average approaches or crosses 2000. 

   Larry Wachtel, a market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, said 2000 would act as "a lightning rod for sellers -- it would be just a logical place to take profits." 

   After the stock market's extended run since mid-1984, Mr. Wachtel said, "there's a shakeout in our future." 
He sees a 5% to 10% correction looming for stock prices, and for Mr. Wachtel, the only question is whether it takes place before or after the industrial average crosses 2000. 

   Blue-chips gave up most of their gains during the session, but the smaller-capitalization stocks traded in the over-the-counter market continued to sail ahead. 
The Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 4.83 to 366.02 as volume expanded to 137.9 million shares from 110.6 million Monday. 
There were 1,704 issues advancing and 692 declining. 

   Ralph J. Costanza, who heads the OTC department at Smith Barney Harris Upham in New York, said the continued advance in this market might be the long-awaited rebound in these stocks. 
The secondary stocks have generally been out of favor since mid-1983. 

   "This is the place to be looking for stocks" because, based on historical standards, they are cheap compared with bluechips, Mr. Costanza said. 

   Among the gainers were Apple Computer, up 3/4 to 43 3/4; Intel, up 1/2 to 22; Intergraph, up 1/4 to 17 1/4; Seagate Technology, up 5/8 to 20 5/8; Howard Savings Bank, up 1/2 to 39 7/8; and Citizen &amp; Southern, up 5/8 to 26. 

   Ford gained 5/8 to 60 5/8 while General Motors rose 1/4 to 68 3/4 and Chrysler gained 1/4 to 40. 
Morgan Stanley raised its 1987 earnings estimate on Ford late Monday and lowered its GM estimate slightly. 

   Retailing stocks, especially department stores, were actively traded and highly touted. 

   Sears jumped 1 5/8 to 43 5/8 on trading of more than 1.6 million shares, making it one of the most-active issues on the Big Board. 
Linda Kristiansen at PaineWebber said Sears's Christmas sales were up a strong 5% to 6% and she expects the company's fourth-quarter earnings will be 10 cents to 15 cents higher than most Wall Street estimates. 

   K mart rose 7/8 to 47 1/4 and F.W. Woolworth gained 1 3/8 to 41 1/2. 
Both stocks were added to Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's buy list. 

   Among other gainers in this sector, Federated Department Stores rose 2 1/4 to 87 7/8, May Department Stores added 5/8 to 37 7/8, Dayton Hudson moved up 5/8 to 44 and J.C. Penney advanced 2 3/8 to 77 3/4. 

   Navistar closed unchanged at 5 1/4, with more than 7.7 million shares changing hands. 
It was the most-active Big Board stock. 
Traders said the stock, because of its low price, appeals to some individual investors. 
But some traders have also seen some big institutional portfolio managers going after the issue. 

   Commonwealth Edison rose 5/8 to 35 3/4 in active trading. 
The utility said the price gain might have resulted from a favorable reaction to news that it plans to spin off three of its nuclear units into a new subsidiary. 

   Wang Laboratories Class B fell 1/2 to 11 1/4. 
The company said it expects to report an operating loss for its second quarter ended Dec. 31 at least as large as the $30 million it reported in its first quarter. 

   Boeing fell 2 3/8 to 51 on volume of nearly 1.6 million shares. 
Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kugel lowered his 1987 and 1988 earnings estimates for Boeing and lowered his recommendation on the stock to a strong hold from a buy. 
He told Dow Jones News Service that the outlook for the military segment of Boeing's business is "worse than I had thought." 
He added that he expects revenues will be lower and margins thinner. 

   Other aerospace stocks were mostly lower: General Dynamics fell 3/4 to 73 1/4, Lockheed dropped 5/8 to 50 3/4, E-Systems declined 1 3/8 to 31 1/2 and Martin Marietta fell 5/8 to 40 1/8. 
But Northrop rose 1/2 to 40 7/8. 

   American International Group finished unchanged at 64 1/2 after trading as high as 66 early yesterday and as low as 62 3/8 in the afternoon. 
An American International unit is the sole property and casualty insurer of the Dupont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where at least 96 people died in a New Year's Eve fire. 

   Gulf &amp; Western rose 1/2 to 66. 
The company raised its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 22.5 cents and said operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to $1.07 a share from 80 cents a share a year earlier. 

   RJR Nabisco gained 1/2 to 52 1/8. 
The company's Heublein unit agreed to purchase the brands and assets of National Distillers' Almaden Vineyards. 
National Distillers moved up 1 to 46 7/8. 

   BankAmerica eased 1/4 to 14 3/4 in active trading. 
The bank holding company rejected First Interstate Bancorp's takeover bid, valued at $22 a share, or $3.39 billion. 
The rejection had been expected for weeks because company officials had hinted privately that the offer was inadequate. 
First Interstate fell 3/8 to 55 1/8. 

   Anheuser Busch rose 7/8 to 28 1/8 on more than 1.3 million shares. 
The stock was recommended by a Wall Street firm.
