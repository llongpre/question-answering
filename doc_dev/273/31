FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: US indices propped up near their record
highs - Patrick Harverson on equity theory in New York

As long as interest rates keep coming down, US share prices are likely to
remain propped up near their record highs. While they may not go up much
further, the markets should not suffer any kind of serious setback if
borrowing costs in the US remain at the lowest levels seen in more than
thirty years.
This, at least, is the theory that the market optimists are counting on, and
recent trends in stock prices support their view. In the past few months
equities have bounced up and down, but always within a relatively narrow
range. And that range has been close to the markets' peaks - so that at any
time prices could reach, or exceed, previous record highs.
It happened earlier this week. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed within 13 points of its record high of 3,554.83, and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, the broadest market measure, closed within 6
points of its all-time high of 456.33. The Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks actually moved into virgin territory, buoyed by
strong demand for smaller company and technology stocks. The new record was
712.49. The Russell 2000, the most comprehensive index of small-cap stocks,
also set a new record high.
These gains were not achieved in a typically subdued mid-summer market.
Volume has held up surprisingly well, considering that summer is well
underway and that many market participants, sensibly, have fled to the beach
or to the country.
On Wednesday, when the Dow climbed 27 points, volume reached 285m shares on
the market's busiest day in six weeks. Clearly, some investors are still
hungry for stocks, although it appears that they are being very choosy - not
buying the market, or sectors, as a whole, but seeking out the recovery
plays, the inexpensive stocks or under-appreciated companies with growth
potential.
In spite of recent gains, and the ability of stocks to hold their ground at
historically high levels, there is not much of a consensus on Wall Street
about where prices are heading next.
Overall, the balance of opinion probably still favours the cautious
forecasters. They warn that, with stocks looking expensive and earnings
growth less than impressive because of a near-stagnant economic recovery, a
correction, albeit not a large one, may be somewhere around the corner.
Yet the tentative forecasts of the pessimists are based upon the assumption
that interest rates are staying where they are, or possibly even going up.
And rates show no such inclination to go up, or even to hold steady. On
Thursday, after two sets of encouragingly weak inflation data, the yield on
the benchmark 30-year government bond dropped to 6.550 per cent, the lowest
it has been since 1977 when the Treasury began issuing 30-year bonds on a
regular basis.
Some bond market economists predict that yields will fall further -
certainly to 6.5 per cent, and possibly lower, because the inflationary
pressures that bumped yields higher in the spring have abated, and because
the economy continues to under-perform. The most bullish of bond market
forecasters believe that President Clinton's deficit-reduction package will
depress economic growth, and lower interest rates further. For them, yields
in the 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent range would not be out of the question.
Such a situation would be both good and bad for equities. The good part
would be lower interest rates, which would divert more investors' cash into
equities and which would cut the cost of borrowing for companies. The bad
part would be the weak economy, which would crimp corporate profitability
and dampen demand for jobs, restricting consumer spending in the process. If
the positive and negative factors balance each other out, prices should
trade near their record highs, but not much beyond that. In other words,
expect more of the same.
Among those forecasting lower interest rates is Ms Elaine Garzarelli of the
investment bank Lehman Brothers, who is one of Wall Street's biggest bulls.
Like many others, she believes that President Clinton's deficit reduction
package will keep interest rates low. Where she differs from her
counterparts, however, is in her analysis of how the package will affect the
economy, and how, ultimately, stock prices will react.
Instead of slowing the economy, she says, 'deficit reduction will cause
moderate economic growth, allow interest rates to remain low, and lead to
higher stock market valuations'. Ms Garzarelli has enough confidence in the
markets to predict that the Dow will break through 4,000 before the year is
out, and reach 4,500 some time next year.
There is only one thing missing from the talk of deficit reduction, interest
rates, stock valuations and economic growth - corporate earnings. The
markets have held their ground well in recent months because improvements in
earnings have been priced into stocks. If companies fail to match those
expected improvements, a sustained sell-off may be inevitable, even with
declining interest rates.
