   Prices surged higher on Wall Street Tuesday and
the Dow Jones industrial average reached another new closing high
as technology issues recovered from Friday's losses and took the
rest of the stock market along for the ride.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 49.57 to
2,870.49, surpassing the blue chip barometer's previous closing
high of 2,856.26, set just last Wednesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 11
to 4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 1,107 up, 434 down and 462 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a relatively light
137.41 million shares, up from 120.25 million in the previous
session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 167.06 million shares.
   Technology issues, which pulled the market sharply lower on
Friday, reversed course Tuesday after a Barron's article said
International Business Machines was on an upward course after
several laggard years. Investors snapped up IBM, bidding the stock
up 3{ to 119}.
   Friday's decline had been triggered by an announcement by the
computer software manufacturer Adobe Systems that its earnings for
the second quarter and full fiscal year were likely to fall short
of analysts' estimates. But Adobe was a winner Tuesday, gaining 2|
to close at 37~ in over-the-counter trading.
   Other high-tech gainers included Digital Equipment, up 2\ to
94}, and Tandy, which gained 1{ to 35{. Both stocks were traded on
the NYSE.
   On the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer rose 1 to 41 and
Intel was up 1&lsqb; to 48|.
   Rising bond prices, which often help support the stock market by
easing concerns about interest rates, did so again Tuesday. The
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up about $4 for each $1,000
in face value by late afternoon.
   Analysts were cautiously upbeat about Tuesday's gains, noting
that the advance came on relatively light volume. But they said the
market showed signs of strength in its ability to shake off
Friday's 35-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``After the Adobe decline on Friday, you'd think it would temper
the enthusiasm, but it certainly has not,'' said Michael Metz, an
analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``It shows a very resilient market, with with underinvested
participants looking for entry points,'' Metz said.
   Some computer-program buying was reported Tuesday, and prices
surged higher late in the session as bargain hunters and investors
who had been on the sidelines jumped in to avoid being left behind.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Varity, which
rose &lsqb; to 3&lsqb;.
   Other Big Board gainers included Time Warner, which soared 3&rsqb; to
109 after another Barron's article called the stock undervalued.
Wal-Mart rose 2&rsqb; to 57{, Disney rose 2&lsqb; to 119}, and Bristol Myers
Squibb was up 1&lsqb; to 61~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $45.179 billion, or 1.33
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
advanced 2.86 to 196.57.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 7.68 to 421.31, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 6.07 to 360.65.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
picked up 3.82 to 457.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 362.56, up 2.72.
