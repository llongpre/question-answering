   Prices moved moderately higher on Wall Street
Wednesday, nudging the Dow Jones industrial average to yet another
closing high and toward the 2,900 mark.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks picked up 8.07 to
finish at 2,878.56 and eclipse the previous high close of 2,870.49,
set only one day before. On Tuesday, the average soared nearly 50
points as technology issues led the market in a late buying surge.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
893 up, 693 down and 523 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a heavy 199.54
million shares, up from 137.41 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 248.22 million shares.
   The market's advance Wednesday came as little surprise to
analysts who expected the momentum from Tuesday's buying spree to
spill over into another session.
   But they also were not surprised by hesitation in the market.
Computer-generated sell orders eroded gains at several points
during Wednesday's session and took the Dow Jones average briefly
into minus territory.
   A.C. Moore, an analyst with Argus Research Corp., said prices
were able to withstand the dips partly because of strength in the
bond market. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up more
than $3 for each $1,000 in face amount by late afternoon.
   Including Wednesday's results, the Dow Jones industrials have
had eight new closing highs this month, but analysts shied away
from predicting the blue chip barometer will crash through 2,900.
   ``I don't sense that the tape has the type of momentum to make
an inexorable drive,'' said Moore, who noted that as prices rise
investors may begin to view stocks as overbought.
   Furthermore, analysts expected the market to become more
cautious prior to the government's release Friday of May employment
figures.
   The government reported Wednesday that its main economic
forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
slipped 0.2 percent in April, its second loss in four months and
another indication of the nation's sluggish economy. Analysts said
the news was in line with market expectations.
   The most active issue on the NYSE was Texas Utilities, which
rose &lsqb; to 36&rsqb;.
   Among blue chip issues, IBM was up 1&lsqb; to 120~, Philip Morris
fell 1&lsqb; to 42{, and General Electric was off &rsqb; at 69&rsqb;.
   Mobil rose 1 to 62~, Dow Chemicals slipped 1 to 63{, and
Woolworth rose 1&lsqb; to 66{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $3.189 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.18 to 196.75.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.31 to 421.62, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.21 to 360.86.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.26 to 458.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 362.91, up 0.35.
