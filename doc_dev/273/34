   A year-end search for bargains among blue-chip
issues propelled stock prices to a broad rally on Thursday that left
the market's best-known gauge only a shade below its highest closing
level this year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which gained 3.75 points
on Wednesday, climbed another 16.25 to close at 2,182.68.
   That was less than a point below its 1988 closing high of
2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21, which also was the highest close since
the October 1987 crash.
   At mid-afternoon, the blue-chip index was slightly above the
year's high closing mark but it lost some ground by the end of the
session.
   As the market heads into its final trading session of the year,
the Dow Jones industrial average is about 12.6 percent above its
1987 close of 1,938.83.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
987 up, 477 down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 131.29 million
shares, up from 110.63 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 160.14 million shares.
   Analysts said year-end bargain hunting was mainly responsible for
boosting prices.
   Michael Metz, market analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., said
most of the institutional investors who wanted to sell have already
done so. ``So when you get some nibbling by bargain-hunters, it is
easy to lift (the Dow Jones industrial average) with no supply
around,'' he said.
   The analysts said the gains also reflected efforts by some
institutional investors to spruce up their end-of-year portfolios or
put some excess cash to work by adding some top-quality issues.
   ``With the market near its highs for the year, the large cash
position that some money managers find themselves with is
embarrassing,'' said Newton D. Zinder, senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He said the gains also demonstrated relief that the stock market
held its ground earlier this week despite rising interest rates.
   Yields on some short-term Treasury issues, for instance, have
risen above 9 percent and pose increasing competition for the
uncertain returns on stocks.
   In the credit markets Thursday, prices and yields were fairly
stable.
   ``The view is that the Fed will not raise the discount rate right
away,'' said Oppenheimer's Metz. The discount rate is the Federal
Reserve's interest charge on loans to financial institutions.
   Among the active issues on the NYSE, SCECorp rose \ to 32],
Navistar rose \ to 5\ and Pepsico rose ~ to 39~.
   Quantum Chemical, which rose 18| on Wednesday after announcing a
restructuring plan, rose [ to 107\.
   Metz said Quantum's plan appeared to draw attention to the values
in several basic industrial groups, such as steel, forest prodcucts
and chemicals, and contributed to rises in those areas on Thursday.
   Fluor rose ~ to 23|, Dow Chemical rose 1{ to 88, Monsanto rose }
to 83, International Paper was up 1 to 46[, Louisiana Pacific added
\ to 28|, Bethlehem Steel rose | to 23~ and USX gained { to 29|.
   International Business Machines rose } to 123\. Also in the
technolgy group, Digital Equipment rose 1| to 98}, Data General
added | to 18{ and Honeywell rose } to 60\.
   In over-the-counter trading, Financial News Network rose 1| to 8]
on speculation that someone may be interested in acquiring a stake
in the business, sports and shopping service.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $18.29 billion, or 0.67
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.09 to 156.90.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.89 to 323.38, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index rose 2.32 to 279.40.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.29 to 379.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 303.69, up 1.55.
