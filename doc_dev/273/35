   The stock market climbed to its highest level
since the October crash with a broad advance Monday that gathered
momentum as the session progressed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41 to
2,071.62, posting more than half its gain in the last hour of
trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,255 up, 351 down and 374 unchanged.
   Big Board volume reached 236.05 million shares, against 191.09
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index gained
2.76 to 150.46.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $44.95 billion, or
1.73 percent, in value.
   Analysts said traders were heartened to see the Dow Jones
industrial average vault past the 2,051.89 level, where it stood
Jan. 7 for its previous highest closing reading since the crash
last year.
   The average failed in a bid to surpass that point last week, but
no significant selling pressure followed, suggest to many analysts
that it was primed to make another try.
   One concern facing the market is the report due Tuesday from the
Commerce Department on the index of leading economic indicators for
January.
   Analysts generally expect the figure to show a decline. But the
firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. said the 0.2 percent drop
originally reported for December might be revised to show a gain.
   That would mean that the index would no longer have a string of
three consecutive monthly declines, a phenomenon that is
traditionally regarded as a potential recession warning.
   The Dow Jones industrials finished February with a gain of
113.40 points. The average stands some 333 points above its close
of 1,738.74 on Black Monday Oct. 19.
   Observers said enthusiasm for stocks was fueled by continuing
brisk takeover activity.
   On the takeover scene, Roper Corp. jumped 10} to 36~. The
company agreed to be acquired by Whirlpool Corp. for $37.50 a share.
   Homestake Mining climbed 3{ to 18. Mesa Limited Partnership made
a $20-a-share offer for the company.
   Stop &amp; Shop picked up ~ to 43{. The company, fighting a hostile
bid by Dart Group, reached agreement on a buyout at $44 a share by
a group organized by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co.
   Point-plus gainers among the blue chips included General Motors,
up 3[ at 72\; Merck, up 4| at 165]; International Business
Machines, up 1} at 117{; General Electric, up 1~ at 45{, and
International Paper, up 1| at 44].
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 265.09 million shares.
   Standard &amp; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 6.80 to 309.43,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 5.36 at 267.82.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 3.55 to 366.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 288.46, up 4.14.
