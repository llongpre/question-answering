   Stock prices gave ground grudgingly yesterday in a busy session of profit-taking following Tuesday's explosive rally. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in a narrow band throughout the day and closed at 1947.27, down 8.30. 
Traders said that after some brief buying by European and Japanese investors, institutional investors took profits through much of the remainder of the day in the blue-chip issues that recently have led the market higher. 

   The broader market indexes also fell, but not as much as the industrial average. 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.15 to 253.85, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index eased 0.04 to 145.05. 
Yet modest gains among airline stocks helped the Dow Jones Transportation Average rise 4.91 to 863.75, its second record in two days. 

   Smaller-capitalization stocks also moved ahead. 
The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index gained 0.67 to 267.89. 

   In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 2.33 to 363.04 as volume expanded to 134.4 million shares from 130.9 million Tuesday. 
There were 1,184 issues advancing and 1,007 declining. 
Financial stocks, a big part of the issues traded in the OTC market, were big gainers, as the Nasdaq financial index advanced 4.07 to 370.35. 

   Volume on the Big Board remained robust, as 200.1 million shares changed hands, compared with 230.4 million Tuesday. 
Tuesday's session was the fourth busiest and yesterday's the seventh busiest on the exchange. 

   Despite the slippage in the major indexes, yesterday "wasn't a day of weakness for the market," said Robert Colby, a technical analyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham in New York. 

   Many traders weren't dismayed with the profit-taking because the industrial average had risen more than 135 points over the previous eight sessions. 
"I don't think we will go up in a straight line. 
It's going to take some time to see how we get over 2000. 
That's going to be formidable," said a New York-based equity trader. 

   Mr. Colby said Tuesday's explosive rally was "an emotional response" to President Reagan's support for a special prosecutor to investigate the Iranian arms sales and to a higher bond market. 
He believes that before Tuesday's move, many of Wall Street's aggressive players had sold borrowed stock short and were frightened into buying it back in the rally. 
And while these short sellers might already have completed much of their buying, or short covering, the industrial average's rush to a record put pressure on investors sitting on the sidelines to reenter the market as buyers, he added. 

   Blue-chip issues were mostly lower. 
International Business Machines fell 1 1/4 to 128 5/8; Eastman Kodak eased 3/8 to 68 1/2; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph eased 1/8 to 27 1/2; and General Electric rose 3 5/8 to 88 1/2 in active trading. 
Dow Jones News Service reported that at a closed meeting with securities analysts Tuesday, GE presented a bullish forecast for its 1987 and 1988 earnings. 

   Drug and chemical issues were big advancers. 
Squibb rose 2 3/4 to 115 3/4; Upjohn moved up 2 7/8 to 104 1/2; Pfizer gained 1 1/4 to 63 1/2; Dow Chemical advanced 1 3/8 to 61 1/4; Allied-Signal added 1/2 to 41 1/4; and Rohm &amp; Hass rose 1/2 to 38. 

   The stocks of several large brokerage firms moved higher in active trading. 
Merrill Lynch gained 1 1/8 to 41 1/4; American Express, which owns Shearson Lehman Brothers, rose 1 to 60 3/4; and PaineWebber rose 1 5/8 to 34 3/4 on volume of more than 2.4 million shares. 

   Auto stocks were mixed. 
General Motors finally scored a gain, rising 1 1/4 to 72 in active trading. 
The stock had taken a drubbing earlier in the week when the company replaced H. Ross Perot as a director and head of its Electronic Data Systems unit. 
Late yesterday, GM said it will cut production at three assembly plants early next year and lay off 4,500 workers. 
Ford eased 5/8 to 59 5/8, and Chrysler fell 1/4 to 40 3/4. 

   Diamond Shamrock moved up 1 1/8 to 14 5/8 on more than 1.9 million shares. 
Mesa Limited Partnership, an oil and gas concern headed by T. Boone Pickens Jr., plans to acquire all of Diamond Shamrock's shares outstanding in a securities exchange valued at nearly $17 a Diamond Shamrock share, or about $2 billion. 
Mesa Limited rose 1/8 to 17. 

   Carter Hawley Hale fell 1 7/8 to 53 1/8. 
The retailer sued to block a tender offer by an investor group led by Limited and Edward J. DeBartolo. 
Limited fell 1/4 to 33 3/4. 
Chesebrough-Pond's moved up 1/2 to 72 1/8. 
The company agreed to be acquired by Unilever for $3.1 billion. 
Unilever said it would sell Chesebrough's Prince Tennis racket and Bass shoe units if the acquisition is completed. 

   Pillsbury fell 2 3/8 to 36 3/4. 
The company said late Tuesday that it expects to report that earnings for its second quarter ended Nov. 30 will be somewhat lower than the year-earlier $56.6 million, or 65 cents a share, adjusted for a subsequent 2-for-1 stock split. 

   On the Amex and in the OTC market, Home Shopping Network's cable shopping competition heated up as Home Shopping fell 1 to 38 3/4. 
C.O.M.B., up 2 to 22 1/4, said its network of 17 major cable operators had sales of $1 million a day for C.O.M.B.-marketed products over the Thanksgiving weekend. 
The company said the sales were achieved with nine million viewers -- half the network's subscribers. 
Class A shares of Tele-Communications, which owns 9.9% of C.O.M.B., rose 3/4 to 25 5/8. 

   QVC Network, which has 5.1 million cable subscribers and has committed to expand to 7.6 million, rose to 23 1/4. 
Horn &amp; Hardart, with an agreement to begin home shopping programming next month through Fox Television, was up 3/4 to 14, although Lorimar-Telepictures, one of its home marketing partners, was down 1/8 at 18 1/2. 

   Comp-U-Card International, up 1 to 13 1/2, is working on a catalog sales and home television shopping combination with Financial News Network, which fell 1/4 to 9 1/2. 
FNN recently replaced Comp-U-Card with a unit of Biotech Capital, up 1/8 to 8 5/8, as the marketing arm of Telshop, its own home shopping effort. 

   Investors similarly displayed enthusiasm for Crazy Eddie, up 1/2 to 14 3/4, which has a 13-week agreement for six hours a week of home shopping on cable. 
Entertainment Marketing, which plans a network for 12 hours a day of such programming, was unchanged at 16.
