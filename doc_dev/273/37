   Stock prices weathered a burst of nervous selling early yesterday afternoon on the way to several more records as the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above 2200 for the first time. 

   Several market sources said the selling followed an unconfirmed report in a West German newspaper that hostage negotiator Terry Waite had been shot in Lebanon. 
The report apparently sparked fears of a worsening of Mideast tensions. 
However, other reports said Mr. Waite had been seen alive and apparently unharmed in the Beirut area. 

   The Dow Jones industrials, which were up 19.12 points at 1:30 p.m. EST, retreated more than 26 points within an hour but recovered to close at 2201.49, up 10.26 in heavy trading. 

   Several broad market indexes also posted records. 
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.05 to 160.36; the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 1.52 to 281.16; and the American Stock Exchange index rose 3.58 to 314.98, its eighth consecutive record close. 
The Nasdaq composite index closed at 405.70, up 2.58, approaching its high of 411.16 set last July 3. 

   Advancing stocks outnumbered losers by 1,039 to 604 on the Big Board. 
On the Amex, winners held a 391-240 edge. 
In Nasdaq over-the-counter trading, 1,416 stocks were up, and 902 were down. 

   Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc., said traders heard the Waite shooting report during the lunch hour and "reacted appropriately." 
But, he said, "The market is very resilient. 
It doesn't react to negative news the way a market does that's getting toppy." 

   Trading was heavy from the opening bell. 
Big Board volume was 256.7 million shares, second only to the 302.4 million shares traded Jan. 23. 
Wednesday's volume was 222.4 million shares. 

   Eugene Peroni, director of technical analysis for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said he expects the Dow Jones industrials to hit 2250 or 2300 around the end of this month, but he then foresees a 10% to 12% correction, perhaps lasting into April. 

   Signs of a "topping configuration," according to Mr. Peroni, are that secondary stocks are starting to outperform the blue-chip industrials and that the ratios of advancing stocks to declining ones have been "a bit zig-zaggy lately." 

   Hans Schueren, a market technician at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, said leadership by secondary stocks is fine as long as it's "not overdone." 
Based on the "extraordinary breadth stampede" that occurred in January, he said, he expects the market's momentum to keep it going forward for a few months. 

   In the 10 trading days through Jan. 15, Mr. Schueren said, the ratio of advancing stocks to declining ones on the Big Board was 2.36 to 1. 
He said he knows of only four previous times when the ratio was that lopsided over a 10-day period -- in November 1962, January 1975, January 1976 and August 1982. 
In each case, the market carried forward for at least two months, and in one case eight months, before encountering a correction of 5% or more. 

   A number of the day's big gainers were involved in takeovers or rumored takeovers. 

   A.H. Robins rose 5 1/4 to 24 1/2 after a 6 1/2-point gain Wednesday. 
American Home Products seeks to acquire Robins, rescuing it from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings and establishing a trust fund for plaintiffs in suits involving the Dalkon Shield birth-control device. 
American Home Products rose 2 3/4 to 85 3/8. 

   Church's Fried Chicken jumped 2 1/4 to 13 3/4 on volume of 807,800 shares. 
In midafternoon, after more than 400,000 shares had changed hands, the company said it had received a request from Sonic Industries to discuss a possible Sonic acquisition of Church's. 

   Gillette rose 1/2 to 60 1/2 after a report that Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs has accumulated a stake in the company. 
Mr. Jacobs said, "The only thing I'll confirm is that I use a (Gillette-made) Trac II razor." 
Traders said there were rumors involving Gillette and other possible suitors. 
The company fended off a hostile bid from Revlon Group last fall. 

   Carter-Wallace gained 3 3/4 to 116 1/4. 
The stock has been advancing lately because it gives investors a way to "participate in the growth of the condom industry," Interstate Securities Corp. analyst Craig Dickson said. 
Condom sales are being spurred by fear of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
Some magazines and television stations have recently begun to accept condom advertising. 

   Carter-Wallace has nearly half the U.S. market for condoms through its Trojan brand. 
Condoms account for about 10% of the company's sales and a higher percentage of its profit, Mr. Dickson said. 

   On the American Stock Exchange, Taiwan Fund, a closed-end investment company that invests mainly on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, rose 2 5/8 to 25 3/4. 
A similar issue on the Big Board, Korea Fund, was up 2 1/4 to 46 3/4. 
Thomas Herzfeld, a South Miami, Fla., broker who specializes in closed-end funds, said the small size of the funds can make their prices volatile. 

   "In a typical market," Mr. Herzfeld said, "first the quality stocks run, then the secondary stocks run. 
You're in a period now where the secondary countries are running." 

   Grolier advanced 1 3/8 to 11 1/4. 
A spokesman said the stock had been depressed recently, but he couldn't account for the upturn. 

   TRW rose 2 1/2 to 107 1/2 after its board recommended a 2-for-1 stock split.
