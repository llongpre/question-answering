   The stock market gained ground for the fourth
straight session Monday, getting a little more mileage out of its
early-1989 rally despite resistance from sellers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.17 to 2,199.46, a
new high since the 1987 crash. Over the past four sessions the
average has climbed 54.82 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
880 up, 639 down and 469 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.18 million
shares, up from 161.33 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 191.09 million shares.
   The market has benefited in recent sessions from buying by money
managers at investing institutions seeking to put some of their
large cash reserves to work at the start of a new year.
   But analysts said traders were worried that the rally had
encountered some large obstacles.
   Each time the Dow Jones industrial average reached the 2,000
level last week and again Monday, selling pressure seemed to
intensify.
   In addition, brokers noted, the advance in stock prices of late
has come without any help from interest rates. Yields on
interest-bearing investments, especially in the short-term money
market, remain a strong competitive threat to stocks.
   The Japanese stock market, meanwhile, rose to a new high Monday,
surprising observers who had expected a decline following the death
of Emperor Hirohito on Saturday.
   In the U.S. market, Pacific Resources jumped 4} to 18{. Broken
Hill Proprietary Co. of Australia reached an agreement to acquire
the company for $19 a share.

company's employee stock ownership plan, dealing a setback to
Shamrock Holdings's hostile takeover bid for Polaroid.
   Holly Farms, which plans to settle a takeover battle by
auctioning itself to the highest bidder, rose 1} to 61}.
   Lockheed climbed 2] to 44{ in buying apparently fueled by
takeover rumors and speculation.

at 90~; Procter &amp; Gamble, up ~ at 87[; International Paper, up ] at
48\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at 29.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.93 billion, or 0.14
percent, in value.
