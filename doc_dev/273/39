   A brief, late rally in the stock market pushed prices higher, but it failed to stir up much enthusiasm among investors for buying stocks. 

   Traders said the market drew support from an advance in the U.S. dollar, reversing some of Monday's slide. 
In addition, long-term bond rates were little changed after moving sharply higher in recent days. 
But investors weren't bidding up stocks aggressively as their demand for equities was light, traders added. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 7.50 points Monday, advanced 16.91 to 1997.51. 
The average briefly passed the 2000 level in early trading. 

   Trading volume was off from Monday's pace because there wasn't much dividend-related trading in utility stocks, which boosted New York Stock Exchange volume to 182.1 million shares Monday. 
About 135.3 million shares were traded on the Big Board yesterday, one of the lowest totals of the year. 
Some 915 issues advanced on the Big Board, while 590 declined. 

   Broader market averages, which dropped more sharply than the industrials the day before, managed to keep pace this time around. 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 2.42 to 258.51 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 1.12 to 146.29. 

   Despite the advance, traders said investors are searching for direction, as no major economic reports are due until the middle of next week and the bond market and the dollar are giving little guidance to investors. 

   "Just as many people are bullish as are bearish" and neither side has much conviction about its stance, said James C. Andrews, first vice president in charge of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., Philadelphia. 

   Alfred E. Goldman, a market analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, sees recent weakness in a number of stocks favored by institutional investors, such as International Business Machines, General Motors and General Electric, as an indication that the market isn't ready to change for the better. 

   Noting that institutions remain willing to keep their money on the sidelines and purchase short-term money market instruments, Mr. Goldman said, "The rally from December is over, and the market is not yet finished going down." 

   One question at this point, Mr. Goldman added, is whether the market will simply drift down to the mid-1800 level on the Dow Jones Industrial Average or stage a sharper, steeper decline that could send the average beneath its recent low of 1736.74 last October. 

   The bond market and the dollar will provide the answer, he said. 
If both remain relatively stable, then a gradual retreat in stock prices is likely. 
"Otherwise, I think it's going to be nastier." 

   Robert J. Simpkins, an analyst at Delafield, Harvey, Tabell Inc. in Princeton, N.J., agreed that the market is likely to head lower. 
But he doesn't expect the downturn to be quite so steep. 
The industrial average isn't likely to drop much below the 1900 level, he said, and there is room for an advance toward new highs later in the year. 

   F.W. Woolworth, which surged 8 7/8 points Monday on news that a partnership led by the chairman of Dart Group is interested in buying as much as 15% of its shares, once again posted the strongest showing among the 30 issues that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
The stock added 2 1/2 to 56 5/8. 

   IBM and Digital Equipment remained under pressure. 
IBM was unchanged at 107 1/2. 
Digital fell 1 to 102 3/4, near its 52-week low of 101 1/2. 

   Airline issues were grounded as Texas Air's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines units lowered some discount fares. 
AMR dropped 1 1/8 to 42 1/8, Delta Air Lines fell 3/4 to 51 and NWA declined 3/4 to 43 3/4, while Texas Air eased 1/4 to 12 in American Stock Exchange trading. 
However, Allegis rose 3/8 to 82 7/8. 

   The weakness in the airline stocks restrained the advance in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which gained only 1.05 to 857.83. 

   Kansas City Southern Industries plunged 3 1/4 to 46 1/2 after the company said late Monday that it agreed to buy back developer Howard Kaskel's 11.3% stake for $60 a share. 
The repurchase, to be carried out with the aid of closely held Hallmark Cards, will bring an end to Mr. Kaskel's hostile takeover attempt. 

   Koppers, which won a preliminary injunction halting Beazer PLC's hostile $60-a-share bid, eased 1 1/8 to 56 1/8. 
Beazer said the chairmen of the two companies met, but that neither official wanted to discuss the offer. 

   Media General rose 3 1/4 to 44 1/8 on the Amex. 
The company told Dow Jones' Professional Investor Report that it couldn't explain the rise in the stock. 
As previously reported, Giant Group Chairman Burt Sugarman has proposed a buy-out of Media General. 
Mr. Sugarman couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Shares of Damon Corp., a diagnostic testing firm, jumped 3 1/2 to 27 on news that an investor group that includes American Magnetics and Ballantrae Partners has a 9.97% stake in the company and may seek control. 
American Magnetics rose 1 to 5 1/2 in over-the-counter trading. 

   RTE Corp. surged 5 7/8 to 37 3/8. 
Mark IV Industries, which owns 6.5% of the company's common shares, launched a $33-a-share hostile tender offer for the rest. 
Mark IV dropped 1/8 to 11 3/4. 

   Envirodyne gained 2 1/4 to 23 in OTC trading. 
Envirodyne said preliminary figures suggest first-quarter earnings were more than 50 cents a share, compared with 38 cents a year earlier. 

   Another OTC issue, Biogen N.V., picked up 1 to 6 3/4. 
Biogen said that it licensed a unit of SmithKline Beckman to make and sell recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in all countries except Japan. 

   Intermedics gained 2 1/8 to 27 5/8. 
Without elaborating, the company said it hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser on "financial alternatives available to enhance shareholder value." 
An investor group with a 25% stake in the company said recently that it may seek the sale of its holdings. 

   MGM/UA Communications, which gained 3 Monday on news that it received acquisition inquiries, advanced another 1 5/8 to 13 5/8.
