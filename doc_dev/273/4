   The stock market kept its 1987 winning streak intact in a busy session that saw several market barometers close at record levels. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 19.12 to 1993.95, its third consecutive record close. 
A strong afternoon rush took the average close to the 2000 mark, but it backed off in the final minutes of trading. 

   The strength of the New Year's rally wasn't expected by many on Wall Street. 
But its breadth has been an even greater surprise, with both large-capitalization and smaller issues joining in the rally. 

   Two of the broader market indexes posted new highs yesterday. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.55 to 255.33, surpassing the record of 254.00 set Dec. 2. 
The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.62 to 146.43, moving past the mark of 145.75 reached last Sept. 4. 

   Gainers had nearly a 3-1 lead over decliners on the Big Board as volume rose to 190.9 million shares from 189.3 million Tuesday. 

   Although much attention has been focused on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it flirts with 2000, the blue-chips haven't been the best-performing issues since the year began. 
That prize goes to many of the smaller issues traded over the counter or on the American Stock Exchange. 

   In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 6.47 to 372.49. 
This index has risen 6.78% since Dec. 31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved up 5.1%. 
However, the OTC composite index is far below its record of 411.16, set last July 3. 

   The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index gained 5.38 to 278.86 yesterday and is up 5.92% since year's end. 

   "We were all curious" to see whether the Dow Jones industrials would get through 2000, said Gerald Simmons, a managing director in the equity department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. 
"But most traders were probably more excited by volume and breadth than by price levels," he said. 

   Traders and analysts like to see a rally accompanied by strong volume and a substantial number of issues advancing in every session. 
But they don't like to see a great number of bulls in the stock market. 
When that happens, they reason that many investors already have bought stock and that there might not be much fuel left for further gains. 
So far, with individual investors not yet stampeding into the market, the New Year's rally gets good marks on all fronts. 

   The Dow Jones Transportation Average hardly kept pace with yesterday's advance. 
It rose 0.49 to close at 842.42, but it spent much of the session in the minus column. 
Some technical analysts found this a bit disturbing, but others said it wasn't a strongly bearish development, as the average had risen 2.98% in Monday's explosive rally, while the industrial average was gaining 2.28%. 

   The stocks of many transportation issues, such as airlines and trucking companies, sagged as investors took some profits and the price of crude oil continued to hold above $18 a barrel. 
Fuel costs are a major expense for these companies. 
Oil stocks, meanwhile, moved generally higher. 

   Among the airlines, UAL fell 3/4 to 54 1/4; Delta Air Lines was unchanged at 49 3/4; NWA eased 1/4 to 63 3/4. 
Railroad issues were mostly lower. 

   Federal Express closed down 1/2 at 65 on more than 1.4 million shares. 
It had traded as low as 63 5/8 earlier in the session. 
Several large blocks changed hands yesterday. 
The company declined to comment on the price drop. 

   Yesterday's session began quietly, with some investors cashing in their chips from the recent advance. 
Traders said their selling was offset by some demand from foreign investors. 
The buying accelerated late in the afternoon, and during most of the final hour, one trader said, "there was literally nothing for sale." 
However, the market ran out of steam right before the closing bell, and the industrial average fell back. 

   Buy and sell programs linked to strategies using stock-index futures and options moved prices around. 
But traders stressed that the bulk of the demand was coming from institutional investors. 

   The bulls may not be an overwhelming majority in the stock market yet, but there are indications that converts are swelling their ranks. 
One indication, Mr. Simmons at Smith Barney said, is the growing number of stock recommendations coming from Wall Street houses since this year began. 

   Security Pacific, Tandy, Gulf &amp; Western, Time and Boeing were among the stocks touted by analysts yesterday. 
Forest and paper-products stocks also were recommended. 

   Boeing eased 1/4 to 50 3/4 on more than 2.5 million shares. 
The stock had dropped 2 3/8 Tuesday after Morgan Stanley cut its 1987 and 1988 earnings for the company. 
Yesterday, Merrill Lynch was one of two firms that reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock. 

   E.F. Hutton rose 2 1/2 to 43 7/8 on renewed takeover speculation, with First Boston named as the prospective buyer. 
First Boston declined to comment. 

   Diamond Shamrock rose 1 1/8 to 14 1/2. 
A group led by T. Boone Pickens began a tender offer for as much as 20 million Diamond Shamrock shares at $15 each. 

   ITT moved up 7/8 to 56 5/8. 
Rand V. Araskog, ITT's chief executive officer, told reporters at a news conference in Brussels that he wouldn't be surprised if the company reduced its stake slightly in its joint venture with the French telecommunications agency. 

   Much of yesterday's activity in the OTC market was centered on larger and more active issues, particularly computer, medical instrument and other technology stocks. 
Apple Computer was up 1 to 44 3/4, Stratus Computer rose 2 1/8 to 26, Intergraph was up 2 to 19 1/4, Tandem Computers rose 1 1/8 to 37 3/4, Seagate Technology rose 1 3/8 to 22, Sun Microsystems closed at 26 1/8, up 1 1/4, and Dynatech was up 2 to 34 1/4. 

   Computer software stocks surged as well, with Microsoft up 2 3/4 to 54, Shared Medical Systems up 1 1/4 to 43 1/2 and Lotus Development up 2 1/4 to 53 1/4. 

   Electronic parts makers moved up, with Intel rising 1 1/4 to 23 1/4, LSI Logic rising 7/8 to 13 and Cypress Semiconductor moving up with other semiconductor issues -- rising 1 1/8 to 9. 

   Broadcasting stocks did well, with LIN Broadcasting up 2 at 59 3/4 and Financial News Network up 7/8 to 12. 

   In the medical instrument group, United States Surgical rose 1 1/2 to 24 5/8, and Stryker was up 2 3/4 to 36. 

   Apparel stocks also gained, with Liz Claiborne up 1 to 47, Oshkosh B'Gosh up 1 3/4 to 59 1/2, Bayly up 5/8 to 15 1/2 and Cherokee Group up 1 1/2 to 26 1/2.
