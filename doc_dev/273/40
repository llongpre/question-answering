   These are awkward times for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
Despite its advances, the DJIA is trailing the market. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, in relative terms, is well ahead. 

   With the S&amp;P and some other market indexes setting highs last week, some analysts are wondering anew whether a narrow index of 30 companies is accurately reflecting the market. 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. strategist Abby Joseph Cohen muses that the industrial average, the most widely followed index, is a relic from "those days of inkwells and green eyeshades." 

   But a comparison of the Dow Jones industrials with the S&amp;P sheds light on which stocks have been rising and why. 

   The DJIA consists mostly of such big industrial stocks as Bethlehem Steel Corp., Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and General Motors Corp. 
Such companies are thought to be sensitive to recession, and a recession is thought to be here, or around the corner, or coming nearly any week, depending on who is asked. 

   The DJIA "reflects concern about the longevity of the economic cycle," Ms. Cohen says. 
Investors, by contrast, "are more inclined to buy the consumer and financial companies which are fully reflected in the S&amp;P," says Steven Einhorn, a strategist at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 

   From Whitefish, Montana, home of James Stack's InvesTech Research, comes another explanation. 
"Merger mania." 
S&amp;P stocks are riding a wave of buy-outs, he notes. 
On the other hand, the DJIA stocks are too big and of the wrong sort to benefit. (Though occasionally it happens; General Foods was acquired in 1985.) 

   John Connolly, Dean Witter's strategist, says the Dow Jones industrials/S&amp;P divergence illustrates the central question facing market timers: 

   "The play here is between the late-cycle stocks and the early-cycle stocks," he says. 
To wit: the Dow Jones Industrial Average is composed of recession-sensitive, "early-cycle" companies: the auto companies, steelmakers and others that expand and reward investors most in the beginning of economic cycles. 
The S&amp;P 500 is led by "late-cycle" stocks such as consumer goods, financial services and utilities. 

   As of yesterday, the S&amp;P closed less than 1% beneath its record of 336.77 reached Aug. 25, 1987. 
The DJIA, however, remains 5.1% behind its high-water mark of 2722.42, reached the same date. 
The DJIA also has underperformed the broader Dow Jones Equity Index, which is composed of nearly 700 issues. 

   Though the S&amp;P is the benchmark for many money managers, few individual investors know the S&amp;P's numerical level. 
In fact, many are unaware that the S&amp;P surpassed its record -- and thus, that stocks can be said to have reached a high -- in intraday trading last week. 

   Historically, the two indexes haven't diverged much; over the past 12 months they have risen nearly the same, roughly 25%. 
But there isn't any doubt that the DJIA is cheaper now. 
It is trading at 11.1 times corporate earnings for the latest 12 months, compared with 13.5 times earnings for the S&amp;P 500. 
By contrast, the P-E ratio of the Dow Jones industrials was 22, and the P-E of the S&amp;P was 23, at the peak of the giddy 1987 rally. 

   Analyst Barry Schrager says the pricier S&amp;P shows that, contrary to current wisdom, speculation is a factor in the current rally. 
The fever, he says, has taken hold in the S&amp;P, where stocks have risen most. 

   "There is a story that people are paying for," he says. 
The story goes like this: people won't stop eating or drinking when the economy slows down, so buy the consumer-oriented stocks in the S&amp;P. 
He points, as an example, to Quaker Oats Co. -- selling at a cool 21 times 12-month trailing earnings. 
He also points to the speculative -- and lately, quite profitable -- practice of "throwing darts at takeover targets." 

   Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Norman Weinger disagrees. 
"When there is speculative money -- people buying the overall market -- they buy the big, well-known Dow stocks," he says. 
People who rely on fundamental analysis of stocks buy shares that figure in the broader indexes. 

   There is one other theory as to why the Dow Jones Industrial Average hasn't quite kept up. 
It is known as the IBM theory. 

   Shares of International Business Machines Corp., afflicted by the maturing of IBM's core, mainframe computer business, have fallen 34% from Aug. 25, 1987. 
That accounts for more than half the difference between the DJIA's level two years ago and now. 

   The Dow Jones industrials also lag far behind the Dow Jones Transportation Average. 
The latter, thanks to airline-takeover speculation, is up about 14% from its August 1987 peak. 

   For those who hold that indexes predict stock prices, rather than merely reflect them, this is worrisome news. 
Technical analysts -- call them the palm readers of Wall Street -- maintain that broad bull markets portend sweeter tomorrows than narrowly rising markets. 

   "The fact that the transportations have moved to record highs and the industrials haven't is a negative," says Richard Russell, the La Jolla, Calif., editor of Dow Theory Letters. 
"You have to ask yourself why 30 of the best blue-chip companies can't equal their 1987 highs." 

   Dean Witter's Mr. Connolly, though, cautions against this approach. 
On any given day, he says, an average may move because of the whims of "program traders trying to scalp the spread in Chicago and New York." 
He says, "I find it hard to believe that all" relevant information about stocks "is captured on the squiggle of a chart."
