   The new highs reached by the Dow Jones industrial
average in late August have so far proved to be more of a letdown
than a breakthrough for the stock market.
   Some observers had thought that when the Dow average at last
surpassed its 1987 peaks, the many skeptics who had doubted the
durability of the market's post-crash recovery would surrender and
join in the party.
   But so far they have instead dug in their heels, intensifying
their predictions of an impending ``correction'' or something worse.
   As analysts at the Merrill Lynch Market Letter put it: ``The Dow
Jones industrial average has finally made a new record high, but the
general market picture hasn't changed much in the past two weeks.
   ``The move to a new high marks an important step in the market's
recovery from the October 1987 collapse, but we doubt that it will
lead to a substantial new advance at this time.
   ``There wasn't much follow-through to the new high and we think
that will continue to be the case.''
   Some analysts say a primary obstacle in the market's path is the
risk that the economy will fail to live up to some very high
expectations.
   ``Wall Street thinks that business will rebound next year. We
doubt it,'' says Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg,
Thalmann &amp; Co. ``Tight money and falling profits have the economy on
track to a modest downturn.''
   To other doubters, the problem lies in the recent performance of
stock prices themselves.
   ``I believe there are a number of disturbing similarities between
the rally of 1989 and the rally of 1987,'' says Charles LaLoggia, a
Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser.
   Just as in 1987, he points out, ``the number of new (individual)
highs on the New York Stock Exchange has been declining
significantly even as the Dow has been making new highs.
   ``This situation reached a new level of absurdity on Monday, Aug.
28 when only 90 stocks, or 4.5 percent of the stocks traded on the
NYSE, were able to make new 52-week highs as the Dow rose to a new
record.
   ``This is a signal that the rally is thinning out and taking
progressively fewer stocks along for the ride, and that's almost
always a sign that the advance is in its final phase.''
   Investors apparently took such warnings to heart in the past
week. The Dow Jones industrials fell 42.55 points to 2,709.54,
ending a run of nine straight weekly gains.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 2.42 to
193.95; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 0.03 to 471.31, while the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up .14 at 384.10.
   Big Board volume averaged 155.31 million shares a day, against
151.49 million the week before.
   Some bulls on the market outlook aren't at all distressed that
the new highs this summer have produced so little enthusiasm.
   In fact, they contend, the longer it takes to convert the bears,
the more room stocks may find to keep on rising.
   ``This year's rally has been strange in that each mini-move up
was met with doubt,'' said William LeFevre at Advest Inc. ``Each
move up brought a new set of reasons why the rally couldn't continue.
   ``As the doubts grew, so did the market's gains. The old cliche,
`every bull market climbs a wall of worry,' was never truer.''
