   After failing in an effort to rebound from its slump late last week, the stock market staged a retreat yesterday that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average below the 2000 level for the first time in nearly three months. 

   Concern about the outlook for interest rates and the economy remained high as market participants awaited the start of this week's round of economic reports, traders said. 

   As a result, the market couldn't sustain an early rally in which the Dow Jones industrials, which dropped 11.03 points Friday, gained about eight points. 
The average ultimately fell 25.78 to 1990.22, marking its first close below 2000 since May 27. 

   Traders said they had expected the market to bounce back after Friday's drop, which was attributed to sell programs resulting from the expiration of August options, but the rebound lasted only through the first few minutes of the session. 
"After that, there really was a lack of demand," said Mel Deichman, head of U.S. equity trading at Deutsche Bank Capital. 

   With the exception of a brief recovery attempt at midday, the market was stuck at lower levels for the rest of the session. 
Weakness in the bond market and a reversal of early gains in the dollar caused the decline to accelerate in the afternoon, traders said, and stocks closed at session lows. 

   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 122.3 million shares, little changed from Friday's total of 122.4 million. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers, 1,107 to 466. 

   Among broader market averages, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dipped 3.26 to 256.98 and the Big Board composite index slid 1.60 to 145.94. 

   This week's round of economic reports begins today with the release of July data on consumer prices and durable goods. 
The market is likely to pay considerable attention to the price report, since it would provide an indication of whether the market's fears about an acceleration of inflation -- and subsequent increases in interest rates -- are justified. 

   "Everyone's hoping or waiting for some sign of a slowdown in consumer demand," said Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. However, he added that investors may need to see "several weeks or months" of economic data pointing in that direction before they believe a slowdown has occurred. 

   Meanwhile, Mr. Metz said, the market is suffering from what he called "consummate disinterest," with participants showing low levels of conviction and high levels of anxiety about the outlook for stocks. 

   At the same time, portfolio managers and their clients remember the second half of last year, in which the October collapse erased their gains earlier in the year, and want to avoid repeating that performance. 
"There's really no pressure to hop aboard even if the market starts to rally," Mr. Metz said. 
"Their premium is on avoiding risk, rather than maximizing return." 

   While most participants apparently are content to remain on the sidelines, Benedict E. Capaldi Jr., a portfolio manager at Brandywine Asset Management, Wilmington, Del., said his firm has been busy lately as a result of the market's shifts in leadership. 

   "Over the last three to four weeks, we've been active," Mr. Capaldi said, since the firm has been taking advantage of the values it sees in cyclical and technology stocks as a result of their recent weakness. 
Brandywine has sold financial-services and utility stocks to finance its buying, he said, because they have been strong performers lately and the firm's portfolios hold almost no cash. 

   The market's overall weakness was reflected in a number of blue-chip issues. 
International Business Machines lost 2 to 110 3/4, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber fell 1 1/4 to 58 3/4, Procter &amp; Gamble dipped 7/8 to 72 5/8, F.W. Woolworth skidded 1 1/4 to 49 3/8, Eastman Kodak lost 1 3/8 to 42 5/8 and USX went down 7/8 to 26 5/8. 

   Wickes soared 3 7/8 to 13 1/4, well above the $12 a share offered for the company by a group led by Chairman Sanford C. Sigoloff, in Big Board composite trading of 5.7 million shares. 
The company has agreed to the group's buy-out proposal. 

   Varo climbed 2 5/8 to 25 3/8. 
Imo Delaval emerged as a rival bidder for the company with a $25-a-share takeover offer, which Varo accepted. 
Last week, United Scientific Holdings of Britain made Varo an offer of a negotiated acquisition for at least $22 a share. 
Imo Delaval lost 1 5/8 to 16 1/8. 

   CP National, which agreed to be acquired by Alltel in a stock swap, added 1 1/8 to 34 1/2. 
Terms of the proposal call for Alltel to swap 1.15 shares of its common stock for each CP share. 
Alltel fell 1 to 33 1/2. 

   Brush Wellman gained 1 to 25 1/2 in trading that featured a single block of 463,000 shares, or 2.5% of the company's shares outstanding. 
The company told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it wasn't aware of the identity of either the buyer or the seller. 
An analyst at Bear Stearns, which handled the transaction, declined comment. 

   Bally Manufacturing added 5/8 to 20 1/2. 
Bear Stearns repeated an "aggressive buy" recommendation on the stock, and an analyst at the firm told the investor report that Bally is a "compelling" stock because it is trading at a 40% discount to its asset value of $33 a share. 

   Albertson's rose 1 1/2 to 33. 
The company posted net income of 56 cents a share for the fiscal second quarter ended July 28, up from 43 cents in the year-earlier quarter. 

   The American Stock Exchange index fell 2.02 to 293.01. 
Volume was 6.5 million shares, down from 6.6 million Friday. 

   Collins Industries added 1/4 to 3 5/8. 
The company reported operating earnings for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31 of 17 cents a share, compared with income from continuing operations of 13 cents a share a year earlier.
