   Stock prices climbed again Tuesday to another
post-crash high as the Dow Jones industrial average finished just
under the 2,700 mark in active trading.
   The widely watched Dow average of 30 industrials rose 4.18
points to 2,699.17, just 23.25 points short of the record closing
high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   The slight increase followed a 41-point surge Monday.
   After rising well above 2,700, the Dow average retreated broadly
in an afternoon selloff analysts termed a normal and measured
reaction to the runup a day earlier. The market regained some
ground in the last 30 minutes of trading.
   ``I think it was healthy we held yesterday's gains without a
backoff, particularly when you're near a psychological level,''
said Edward P. Nicoski, a technical analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis.
   ``There's been no panic selling even though we've been near this
level,'' he said.
   The Dow average's flirtation with the 2,700 level has
resurrected fears from two years ago, when the market's historic
highs reached in August were shattered two months later in the
worst crash in history. The Black Monday panic of Oct. 19, 1987 has
made many investors cautious.
   ``The ability of the market to probe into the 2,700 level and
sustain itself has encouraged more and more people to become
bullish,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst with MKI
Securities Corp.
   Besides the Dow average, most other, broader market measures
already have reached new peaks, surpassing their 1987 tops.
   Good performances among select blue-chip stocks and
takeover-related news in the airline industry paced Tuesday's gains.
   UAL rose 8{ to 219\ after soaring 46{ Monday, when the company
disclosed it received a buyout offer from investor Marvin Davis.
   The strength trickled over to other airlines, with AMR up 2] to
73|, Delta 2\ to 76} and Pan Am \ to 4\ in heavy trading. Midway
jumped 1} to 20} after Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. disclosed it had
acquired a 6.6 percent stake in the company.
   Among leading blue chips, International Business Machines rose ~
to 118\, Digital Equipment gained 3} to 101}, Eastman Kodak was up
1] to 49, Alcoa was 1\ higher at 74 and Boeing climbed 2{ to 53~.
   Wang, the struggling computer firm, gained 1[ at 6~ on the
American Stock Exchange after Frederick Wang, son of the company's
founder, resigned as president. The computer networking company
3Com tumbled 4] to 14[ in over-the-counter trading as its earnings
forecast was revised downward.
   Other losers included International Paper, down 1| to 55], and
Westinghouse Electric, off 2\ to 70.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
834 up, 688 down and 496 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 200.34 million shares, up from 169.75
million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional
exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 237.89
million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.21 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.04 to 194.23.
