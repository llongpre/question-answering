US stocks plummeted yesterday as a concerted effort by the world's central
banks to lift the slumping dollar proved ineffective, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 62.15 at 3,636.94, as the
blue-chip stocks were swamped by waves of computer-guided selling. The NYSE
imposed its 'uptick' restrictions on program trading at 11am, after the
Dow's decline crossed the 50-point threshold for the first time.
But the losses were not confined to the blue chips, as in other recent
sessions. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 6.83 lower at
442.80.
Declining issues on the NYSE outnumbered advances, 1,879 to 379 in moderate
volume of 261m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 4.95 at 426.30,
and the Nasdaq composite shed 7.06 to 693.79.
Before the opening, investors were braced for a rocky session. Overnight the
dollar had dropped a full yen against the Japanese currency after two days
of relative stability. News of the intervention, led by the Federal Reserve
and the Bundesbank, reached the market just as trading began. The reaction
was decidedly negative, as the rescue mission appeared to underscore the US
currency's vulnerability and raised doubts about the sustainability of the
support effort.
The sell-off in stocks gathered pace as the morning progressed and it became
apparent that the intervention was having a marginal effect. Bonds breached
a key support level, and share prices went into a free-fall which was
finally broken when the program-trading 'collar' was put in place. Towards
the close, the Dow lurched downward for a second time, to close near its
session low.
The morning's events suggested the Fed may have no choice but to lift
interest rates again. As a result, the share prices of companies which would
suffer the most from an economic slowdown were hit hard yesterday. Alcoa
dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 , DuPont lost Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 58 1/2 and International Paper shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 67 5/8
.
Transport issues flagged, with the Dow Jones Transportation Index showing a
35-point decline, or 2.19 per cent, to 1,589.94. Among the airlines, UAL,
parent of United, fell Dollars 5 to Dollars 120 and AMR, parent of American,
dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 57. Roadway, a trucking company, was down
Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 66.
Surprisingly, technology issues held up fairly well, thanks in part to
bargain-hunting on the heels of yesterday's rout. At least two investment
houses upgraded their ratings on Oracle Systems, which develops database
management software. The stock jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 36 5/8 .
Among other widely held Nasdaq issues, Lotus Development improved Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 34 1/4 , Wellfleet added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 and Atmel
climbed Dollars 1 9/16 to Dollars 24 1/32 .
On the negative side, Gateway 2000, which sells personal computers through
the post, was marked down Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 10 5/8 , or 15 per cent,
on a profits warning.
Canada
Toronto stocks fell sharply in relatively light trading. The 300 composite
index plunged 74.68 points, or 1.85 per cent, to 3,959.85 in volume of
48.8m.
The composite index last closed below the 4,000-point level in October 1993.
All 14 stock groups ended lower, with pipelines and financial services
recording the largest declines of 2.94 per cent and 2.68 per cent
respectively. Consumer products fell 2.45 per cent, industrial products lost
1.82 per cent and mining fell 1.70 per cent. Gold and energy stocks were
each down over 1 per cent on index.
Mexico
Mexican shares continued to fall sharply, losing over 50 points following
the resignation of Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo. The IPC index of 37
leading shares was off 56.52 points, a fall of 2.52 per cent, at 2,186.41.
The highly respected Carpizo was due to oversee the August presidential
elections and to ensure that they were clean.
