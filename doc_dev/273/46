   Stock prices worked their way higher in an
erratic session Thursday, getting a bit more mileage out of
Wednesday's strong rally.
   As has been the case for much of the time this year, smaller
stocks turned in a better showing than the big-name blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained 64.16
points Wednesday, edged up another 0.50 to 2,062.17.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 988 up, 541 down and 473 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 177.84 million shares, against 181.76
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
.52 to 150.28.
   Over the past three days the Dow Jones industrial average has
gained 81.47 points.
   Analysts said new signs of stability in the dollar had touched
off rallies in stock markets around the world.
   The Tokyo stock market climbed Thursday to new highs, having
recovered all the ground it lost in last year's crash.
   But the U.S. bond market showed less life. Prices of long-term
government bonds declined slightly, putting their yields in the
8.75-8.8 percent range.
   And brokers said many traders were reluctant to chase after
stocks while talk persists that the Federal Reserve might be
leaning toward a tighter credit policy, and that leading banks
might soon raise their prime lending rates.
   Among Japanese stocks traded in the U.S. markets, Honda Motor
gained 3 to 141; Matsushita Electrical 3} to 223}; Hitachi 1[ to
116{, and Sony | to 43].
   Those four were among 30 Big Board issues that made new 52-week
highs during the session, while 10 hit new lows.
   UNC Resources rose 2| to 10}. Odyssey Partners, a private
investor group, said it holds a 5.84 percent interest in UNC and
might seek to buy it out.
   Lucky Stores gained 3} to 52{. The company said it considered a
takeover bid by American Stores at either $45 a share or $50 a
share inadequate, and is considering several alternatives.
   Irving Bank jumped 3} to 67~ on speculation that the company,
which is fighting a takeover bid by Bank of New York, might be
close to reaching a deal with another party.
   General Electric was down { at 41\ in active trading, despite
the company's report that its first-quarter earnings reached 80
cents a share, against 68 cents in the comparable period last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.0 billion, or 0.34
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 206.71 million shares.
   Standard &amp; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.02 to 309.73,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.67 at 266.16.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.14 to 378.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 299.38, up 1.80.
