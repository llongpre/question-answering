   Stocks retreated further in quiet trading Monday
from near-record levels reached last week, but brokers said the
underlying market remains strong.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.07 points to
finish at 2,677.92.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
986 issues down, 473 up and 532 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.01 million
shares, down from 197.55 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.84 million shares.
   The market opened lower behind a weak bond market and on
continued profit-taking after Friday's steep decline.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its sharpest
drop since late June after trading above the all-time high of
2,722.42, reached on Aug. 25, 1987. The market had tested the 1987
peak Thursday, closing at 2,712.63.
   Stock prices rose late Monday morning but quickly reversed course
again and seesawed through the remainder of the session. Blue-chip
stocks rallied early in the afternoon but the broader market failed
to keep pace and the rally was soon aborted, analysts said.
   ``The recent action is a timeout to our rally, not a topout,''
said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis. ``It just shows that sellers are not that anxious to
sell.''
   A late selloff in the bond market helped weaken stocks in the
final hour of trading.
   Wall Street analysts said the market's pause was not surprising
after recent gains and that the market continued to show an
underlying strength. Much of the weakness, they said, stemmed from a
lack of buying and some computerized selling strategies, not from
strong individual or institutional selling.
   ``The market's ability to stabilize after last week shows it has
some life to it and that upside potential is still viable,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $15.72 billion, or 0.46
percent, in value, from Friday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.90 to 191.37.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Telephone and
Telegraph closed down ~ at 38{, General Electric lost } to 56|,
Hewlett Packard fell 2{ to 52} and Paramount Communications declined
1] to 59~.
   IBM rose { to 116[, Eastman Kodak advanced ] to 50] and Procter &amp;
Gamble gained 2[ to 126}.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.61 to 392.77, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index lost 1.16 to 343.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.49 to 459.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 379.00, down 1.64.
