   Fresh declines in interest rates and a late
buying surge helped the stock market extend its spring rally on
Tuesday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to its fifth
record high in seven sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 24.77
points to an all-time high on Monday, gained 7.55 points to set
another record at 2,852.23.
   Chances for another advance were in some doubt at midday as
profit-taking eroded a strong early rally but buyers appeared in
the last 30 minutes of trading to give the market a lift.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
816 up, 689 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 203.35 million
shares, up from 166.28 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 242.36 million shares.
   The market got an early lift from declining interest rates and a
strong performance on stock markets in Tokyo and London.
   After the market opened, the Dow Jones industrials surged nearly
26 points higher in the first half-hour of trading before the rally
stalled.
   By noontime, the Dow Jones industrial average was slightly below
Monday's closing level and it drifted in negative territory for
most of the afternoon.
   ``There was probably a little too much exuberance at the
beginning,'' said Newton D. Zinder, a market analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton.
   Bill Raftery, vice president for technical research at Smith
Barney &amp; Co., added at midday, ``This is perfectly normal
profit-taking.''
   The stock market has rolled up some impressive gains over the
past three weeks in a rally that has been attributed mainly to
declines in interest rates.
   Declining rates help stocks by making the potential rewards on
stocks more appealing than yields on fixed-income investments.
Lower rates also can improve the profit outlook for some companies
by cutting their borrowing costs.
   In the credit markets Tuesday, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds
slipped toward 8.61 percent from 8.68 percent late Monday.
   Nonetheless, some market watchers expect a correction in the
stock market that will drive prices lower.
   But even small declines in stock prices appeared to draw out
buying interest in the last 30 minutes of the session, lifting the
market higher.
   ``It shows that even modest price discounts are being met by
anxious buyers who have missed this three-week old rally and short
sellers,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical market
analysis at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Short-sellers are traders who establish positions based on the
presumption that prices will fall; they are often drawn into the
market as buyers when it becomes clear they have bet wrong and have
to settle their accounts.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Nova Corp. of
Alberta, Canada which fell &rsqb; to 7 following a {-point gain in
similarly active dealings on Monday. The company had said Monday it
was selling its rubber division.
   Computer Associates International fell &rsqb; to 15{ after reporting
earnings results that disappointed some analysts.
   Among widely-held stocks, Philip Morris rose { to 45, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost \ to 43&lsqb; and International Business
Machines rose } to 117}.
   Federal Express tumbled 5&lsqb; to 47 amid some apparent
disappointment over April volume figures released late Monday.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $7.036 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.30 to 195.58.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.97 to 418.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.43 to 358.43.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.00 to 453.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 359.85, up 0.49.
