   An afternoon rally sent stock prices higher
Monday after a steep opening slump, but trading was reduced by a
power outage that curtailed operations at the American Stock
Exchange and several brokerages.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 30.20 to
2,746.78.
   But declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancing ones in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
726 up, 766 down and 479 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 122.82 million
shares, down from 145.34 million in Friday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 151.19 million shares.
   The market opened with a thud, with the Dow Jones average
plunging as much as 32 points in the first half hour.
   The drop followed steep losses overseas. The key index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei, posted its fourth-largest
percentage drop ever due to concern about the Mideast. Share prices
also finished lower on London's Stock Exchange.
   But prices in New York began to pick up in the afternoon in a
``light-volume rally,'' said Dudley Eppel, a managing director at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. He said the market
had reached an ``oversold'' state and investors resumed buying.
   Prices rose further late in the session in a bout of
computer-driven buying tied to the futures market.
   ``In the light-volume days the computer controls the tape. It
takes it right out of our hands,'' Eppel said of the program
trading.
   Trading on the American Stock Exchange, as well as on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, was cut off
shortly after 1 p.m. EDT after a fire knocked out power in
Manhattan's financial district. The exchanges were forced to halt
trading for the rest of the day.
   The NYSE was not affected by the outage, but many brokerage
houses said their operations were curtailed.
   Analysts had expected the stock market to continue its downward
path from Friday, when the Dow plunged 42.33 points. Concern about
the Mideast and the effect of rising oil prices on the economy
prompted investors to dump stocks in favor of safer investments,
analysts said.
   But the fact that conditions in the Mideast did not deteriorate
significantly in recent days may have helped spark Monday's rally,
Eppel said.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks, IBM rose 1} to 103}, Eastman
Kodak jumped 2{ to 43{, Philip Morris was up | to 46{, and Boeing
was down &rsqb; to 52|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market grew $20.877 billion, or 0.65
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.48 to 185.63.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index rose 3.32 to 338.84.
S&amp;P's industrial index was unavailable due to the power outage.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.27 to 408.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index as of 1 p.m. EDT _ before the market was forced to close by
the power outage _ stood at 338.14, down 1.18.
