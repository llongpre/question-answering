<LEADPARA>  Stocks surged to new heights Wednesday, driven by growing sentiment that
America's economy is showing the first real signs of recovery.;   The Dow
Jones industrial average capped a five-day rally by vaulting past the high it
set less than two months ago, and some other indexes continued plowing into
record territory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Dow ended the day at 3,061.72, up 20.35 points in heavy trading. That
represented a gain of 115 since Oct. 9 and surpassed the previous high of
3,055.23, set on Aug. 28.;   More important, trading volume on the New York
Stock Exchange reached 227.2 million shares, up from 213.9 million Tuesday and
the highest since 240.6 million shares changed hands Sept. 20.;   Two days of
200 million-plus share volume suggests that a new wave of buying interest
could be rolling into the market, analysts said.;   The impetus, they said,
may be some stronger-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings reports
that suggest business improved for some companies in the summer or at least
got no worse.;   "You're getting some reasonably good earnings reports, and
the general concern over earnings is beginning to lift a little," said Alan
Sachtleben, chief investment officer for stocks at American Capital in
Houston.;   Other indicators reaching new heights included the American Stock
Exchange composite, up 4.97 to close at a 1991 high of 381.91, but still below
its 1989 and 1990 levels. The NASDAQ composite, a measure of Over-the-Counter
trading, closed up 6.83 at 540.94, an all-time high.;   The Russell 2000, a
more precise measure of smaller stocks, rose 2.25 to 182.84, breaking its old
high of 180.78 set Oct. 9, 1989, just a few days before a market plunge. The
Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks, which reflects blue-chip issues, did
not hit a new high, but closed up 1.79 at 392.80.;   AMR, parent of American
Airlines, acted as the catalyst for a rally in airline stocks and paced the
Dow transports to higher levels. It reported third-quarter earnings of $1.02 a
share, way above expectations.;   AMR's stock rose 4 1/8 to 65 5/8. UAL gained
8 1/8 to 136, and Delta Air Lines rose 2 to 70.;   In spite of the Dow's
record, a certain amount of caution remains in the market, noted Paul
Kronlokken, technical analyst for Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood. "Of the 30
components making up the Dow, 10 were down and 20 were up."; LOCAL STOCKS;
