   Stock prices reached record highs for the second
straight session Wednesday, riding the latest wave of the powerful
advance that began almost a year ago.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.53 to
2,771.09, stretching its gain since the start of the week to 78.27
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
831 up, 656 down and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 194.59 million
shares, up from 182.55 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 231.99 million shares.
   Analysts noted some ``catch-up'' buying by investors who were
caught off guard by the market's rerurgent rally this week.
   The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure
to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates.
   Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that
the Federal Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy
further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable
inflation news.
   Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets Wednesday. But
after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks
began forging ahead again.
   Since last Nov. 16, when the Dow Jones industrials settled back
to 2,038.58, the average has soared 732.51 points, or 35.93 percent.
   USX, the day's most active issue, made a big contribution to the
Dow's gain with a 2{ rise to 38}. Financier Carl Icahn, who owns
about 11 percent of the company, was widely rumored to be
increasing his stake in a move to enhance the return on his
investment.
