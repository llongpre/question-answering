   Blue-chip stock prices posted some small gains
Thursday, but prices finished narrowly mixed in the broader market
as a strong morning rally eroded in the afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was up 33.78
points on Wednesday, rose another 4.28 to close at 2,644.37. The
market's best-known index had been up more than 22 points shortly
before noontime.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a narrow margin in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
768 up, 696 down and 505 unchanged. The NYSE's composite index fell
0.22 to 184.09.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.24 million
shares, down from 186.71 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 210.72 million shares.
   Stock prices moved higher for most of the morning, pushing the
Dow Jones industrial average up 22.30 points as of 11:30 a.m. EST.
   But profit-taking drove prices steadily lower in the afternoon,
and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped below Wednesday's
closing level in the final hour of trading before rallying once
again at the close.
   Some analysts said the market is still showing the scars of a
big selloff in January which saw the Dow drop from a peak of more
2,800 early in the month to about 2,543 on Jan. 30.
   In the seven sessions since then, the market has recovered more
than 100 points as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``The market was ready to get off its back and was able to get
up on one knee, but it was not ready to jog around,'' said Bill
Raftery, a vice president in the technial research department at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The stock market has been preoccupied this week by the
Treasury's $30 billion auction of new securities and its potential
impact on interest rates.
   Rising interest rates hurt stocks because they make yields more
competitive on fixed-income securities and raise the costs of
borrowing to buy stocks.
   Bidding was strong for the first two phases of the auction,
which involved sales of $10 billion each in three-year and 10-year
notes.
   But Thursday's auction of $10 billion in 30-year bonds, the last
part opf the three-stage auction, failed to go as well.
   The bond were sold for an average yield of 8.50 percent, and
there were fewer than $2 in bids for every $1 in bonds sold.
   Some stock market watchers said the end of the borrowing spree
may bode well for stocks no matter how the last stage of the
auction went.
   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and director of technical
research at Gruntal Financial Inc. in Stamford, Conn., said the
market is headed up to 2,700 on the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``We are running into a little profit-taking here,'' he said.
``But I think the market is entitled to some kind of hesitation.
With the bond refunding program out of the way after today ... the
market won't have that obstacle in its way and we can test above
the 2,700 level.''
   Leading the NYSE's active list was Varity, which fell &lsqb; to 3\.
   Philips Petroleum was the second most active stock, rising &rsqb; to
26{.
   Oil stocks as a group were strong. Atlantic Richfield added } to
112&rsqb;, Chevron gained 2&rsqb; to 70\, Pennzoil rose 1 to 85{ and Texaco
was up 1\ to 59|.
   Among blue-chip issues, IBM fell &rsqb; to 102}, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph was up &rsqb; to 40\ and Philip Morris was up &rsqb; at 39&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market slipped $1.345 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.40 to 384.99, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 0.79 to 332.96.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.53 to 427.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 1.33 to 357.68.
