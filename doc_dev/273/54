   Scattered buying of blue chips lifted the Dow
Jones average to a new high since the October 1987 crash in the
stock market Monday.
   But otherwise stocks showed little life in a quiet holiday
session.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 big-name stocks climbed 8.71 to
2,158.96, surpassing the previous post-crash closing peak of
2,158.61 it reached on July 5.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances, however, in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
693 up, 711 down and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 124.66 million
shares, down from 216.39 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 148.43 million shares.
   Stocks had trouble extending Friday's strong rally in the
absence of many investors who were taking Columbus Day off.
   The market for government securities, which sets the tone for
interest rates, did not operate Monday.
   Still, analysts said traders were heartened by the news late
last week of smaller-than-expected employment growth in September.
   The resulting rally in the bond and stock prices carried several
of the broader stock-market indicators past their July highs on
Friday. On Monday the Dow joined them.
   Best Products led the active list, up 6[ at 26~. The company
agreed to be acquired by a New York investment firm for $27.50 a
share.
   Pinnacle West Capital tumbled 3| to 19\. The company's chairman
said Friday that its 1989 earnings probably won't be enough to keep
the dividend at its present level.
   General Electric, which reported a 17 percent increase in its
third-quarter earnings, rose [ to 44[
   Among other actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph gained { to 27; American Express 1\ to 30; McDonald's 1]
to 51, and International Business Machines [ to 116[.
   Precious metals stocks chalked up broad gains as the price of
gold rallied $5.40 an ounce to $408.60 on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, responding in part to higher oil prices.
   ASA Ltd. picked up } to 39{; Newmont Gold 2 to 35~; Battle
Mountain Gold ~ to 15}, and Freeport-McMoRan Gold | to 13\.
   Major oil issues were mixed with fractional price changes.
   Time Inc., which has been caught up lately in speculation about
a possible buyout or other deal, was up 3 at 120{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.02 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .15 to 156.95.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .55 to 319.72, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .17 at 278.24.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .18 to 385.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 304.09, up .27.
