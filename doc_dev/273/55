   Stock prices drifted lower in listless trading yesterday as they gave back some of the gains scored in the final minutes of hectic trading Friday. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.67 at 1926.18. 
The mayhem of the final hour of trading Friday, caused by the simultaneous expiration of stock index futures and options as well as individual equity options, pushed the industrial average up more than 16 points. 

   The industrial index fell about two points in the initial half hour of trading yesterday, then moved to a decline of nearly 12 points at 1 p.m. EST. 
But late buying helped erase some of the early declines. 

   The lower opening wasn't a surprise. 
When the nearby March contract on the widely traded Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index closed Friday below the price of the actual index, traders were expecting to see stock prices weaken yesterday morning. 
When the futures contract is selling at a discount to the cash index, it becomes worthwhile for some investors to sell the stocks that make up the index and buy the futures contract. 

   The broader market indexes, which had scored larger gains Friday, lost more ground yesterday. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.98 to 248.75, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.63 to 142.02. 

   Volume on the Big Board, though active, was far from Friday's record-setting pace. 
Yesterday 157.6 million shares changed hands compared with 244.7 million Friday. 

   Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said blue-chip stocks have been faring better than smaller-capitalization issues since the spring. 
Increasing market jitters from a belief that the continuing insider trading investigations could bring down other prominent Wall Street figures besides Ivan F. Boesky and from the loss of confidence in the White House over the Iran scandal have spurred the flight of investors to blue-chips, Mr. Peroni said. 

   He noted that there are divergences even within the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
Of the 30 stocks in the average, he expects such stocks as Chevron, Du Pont, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, General Electric, International Paper, McDonald's, Merck, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Owens-Illinois and Westinghouse Electric to carry the industrial average beyond 2000 even as the other issues in the average languish. 

   Newton Zinder, a technical analyst with E.F. Hutton in New York, added that selling for tax reasons was also depressing some of the second-tier issues. 
Selling for tax reasons should have wound down by this time. 
But he noted that because many investors are also selling to take capital gains this year before the tax rates change in 1987, the selling may have dragged on longer than usual. 
Under the Big Board's five business day settlement for regular trades, today is the last day an investor can sell stock for 1986 tax purposes. 

   Some oil stocks moved higher on the news that ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut production and sell oil at fixed prices averaging $18 a barrel. 
Stock analysts said the reaction in the stock market was rather subdued because there had been talk of $18 a barrel since last week. 
There was also some skepticism about the staying power of this new OPEC agreement since others have fallen apart. 

   Atlantic Richfield rose 1 1/4 to 61 3/4; Chevron gained 1/2 to 46 1/2; Mobil inched up 1/4 to 40 3/8; Standard Oil moved up 7/8 to 50 3/8; Exxon rose 1/8 to 72 7/8; Royal Dutch rose 1 1/2 to 94 3/4; and Shell Transport moved up 1 to 56 7/8. 

   Amoco fell 1 5/8 to 68 3/8. 
This stock gained 4 1/8 Friday, mostly in the final hour buying spree. 
Dow Jones News Service reported that L.F. Rothschild oil analyst Rosario Ilacqua said the stock was overpriced relative to his 1987 earnings estimate for the company. 

   The stocks of several oil equipment and oil service industry companies and those of drillers posted small gains on the OPEC news. 

   Airline stocks were mostly lower because fuel is the biggest expense for this industry. 
AMR fell 7/8 to 55 1/8, UAL dropped 1/2 to 57 3/4 and Delta Air Lines eased 1/4 to 48 7/8. 
But USAir rose 1/4 to 36 1/2 and NWA moved up 1/4 to 61 3/4. 

   ITT rose 1 7/8 to 53 7/8. 
A company spokesman denied a published report that ITT was planning to complete the sale of 65% of its world-wide telecommunications operations to France's state-controlled Compagnie Generale d'Electricite yesterday. 
However, he said the sale is still on schedule and should be completed by Dec. 31. 
There were market rumors that the company might use the cash to buy back stock. 
The spokesman said a stock buyback has always been one of the options ITT has considered, but no decision has been made. 

   Joy Manufacturing moved up 2 1/8 to 34 5/8. 
The company plans to go private in a leveraged buyout at $35 a share. 
The move was announced after Pullman-Peabody raised its offer to acquire Joy to $34 a share. 
Pullman was unchanged at 7 1/8. 

   Retailing stocks crumbled amid continuing worries about weak sales this Christmas season. 
Federated Department Stores lost 7/8 to 87 7/8; Toys "R" Us dropped 1 1/4 to 29 3/4; Limited fell 1 1/8 to 32 7/8; May Department Stores slid 7/8 to 36 7/8; F.W. Woolworth fell 1 1/8 to 39 1/8; and Wal-Mart gave up 3/4 to 48. 

   Navistar rose 1/8 to 4 7/8. 
It was the most-active Big Board issue, with more than 5.4 million shares traded. 
Friday, in line with its capital restructuring program, the company issued and sold 128,295,721 shares at 4 3/4. 

   Telerate gained 2 to 28 1/4. 
The company agreed to acquire the 49.6% of its international operation that it doesn't already own. 
Under the accord, Dow Jones and the Associated Press each will sell to Telerate their separate holdings of 24.8% in AP-Dow Jones-Telerate, which operated Telerate's financial information network outside North America. 
Dow Jones eased 1/4 to 40 1/4 even though the company said it expects a gain of 26 cents a share from the sale of its stake in this venture. 

   International Technology tumbled 5 3/8 to 17 5/8 in extremely active trading, as more than 1.1 million shares changed hands. 
Late Friday, the company said it expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter to be lower than the 16 cents a share it earned a year earlier. 

   Stephen Schweich, an analyst with Balis &amp; Zorn, said the Environmental Protection Agency isn't geared up to send the Superfund monies for toxic waste cleanup as quickly as many had expected. 
So, private industry, to which International Technology caters, doesn't feel compelled to act right way. 
He said companies like International Technology are seeing their costs rise while their revenues remain flat. 

   In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.94 to 351.30 as volume contracted to 119.8 million shares from 129 million Friday. 
There were 814 issues advancing and 1,310 declining.
