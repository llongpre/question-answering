   Was the Fourth of July week the over-the-counter market's last big bang for a while? 

   Nasdaq OTC stocks were sparkling in the first half. 
By June 30 the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 19.4% -- about double the New York Stock Exchange composite, the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow Jones industrials. 
And when OTC traders returned from the July Fourth holiday, they drove the Nasdaq composite to a post-crash high, the first major stock barometer to do so. 

   In the euphoria, the National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs Nasdaq, proclaimed in a news release "a return to the historic pattern in the U.S. markets in which the stocks typical of the Nasdaq market generally outperform larger ones." 
Confidence of both individual and institutional investors in Nasdaq securities "is returning," the NASD said. 

   Today, most people involved in OTC stocks are tempering their enthusiasm. 
The numbers aren't as sexy anymore. 

   When the third quarter ends this month, the Nasdaq indexes -- while still outpacing other U.S. market barometers -- will probably no longer have commanding leads. 
As of Friday, the Nasdaq composite was up not 19% but 15%. 

   In comparison, the Big Board composite was up 9%; the S&amp;P 500 nearly 8% and the Dow nearly 7%. 

   Why the slowdown? 
Analysts blame a lack of small-investor interest in stocks and a series of earnings disappointments from Nasdaq's own "blue chips." 
These are the large technology stocks such as Apple Computer, Intel and Microsoft, whose rallies often bring along many of Nasdaq's other 5,300 issues. 
Apple's stock price is down 13% in the third quarter, Intel is down 22% and Microsoft is off 19%. 

   OTC traders fondly recall the bullish atmosphere in the first half as if it were years ago. 
At A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, head OTC trader William Sulya remembers that investors were so excited by surging small-stock prices in the first half that the concept of "long term" went out the window. 

   "I remember in the first half that if we sold stock to someone and the next week it was down half a point, he'd call up and say 'what's the matter?'" says Mr. Sulya. 
"What used to be the settlement date was now 'long term.'" 
Investors forgot about the peaks and valleys of a market, he says. 

   These days, it's "a helluva lot tougher to get somebody's ear and convince them" to buy stocks, says Mr. Sulya. 

   Edward Hartmann, president of American Express Co.'s IDS Growth Spectrum Advisors, a Minneapolis portfolio manager, isn't fazed by the OTC slowdown. 
Nasdaq indexes -- which he says are overrated as proxies for small-stock performance -- "did cool off since the end of May, but their superior performance in the beginning of the year was so good, that shouldn't be any surprise to anyone." 

   Forget those big Nasdaq technology companies, says Mr. Hartmann. 
He stresses that smaller companies -- as measured by those with $300 million or less yearly revenue -- declined only 3.5% during July and August, while the S&amp;P 500 was off about 4.5%. 

   Jeff Weiss, a senior market technician at Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York, says that although the Nasdaq composite hasn't performed as well as other popular averages lately, it's "still above its May trough back in the 363 region. 
This is a market where investors seem skittish about buying even the top-tier names, so the lackluster performance of the Nasdaq isn't surprising." 

   Yet long term, Mr. Weiss adds, "a convincing weekly close above a formidable resistance barrier in the 396-402 range would have quite bullish implications for the over-the-counter market."

   NAME GAMES: Some OTC companies love catchy trading symbols for their shares -- partly to attract traders with senses of humor. 
Nasdaq has had BABY for Fertility &amp; Genetics Research, SODA for A&amp;W Brands and BOOM for Explosive Fabricators. 
The attempts at humor haven't waned in recent months. 
Besides TUXX for Al's Formal Wear, new symbols include LENS for Concord Camera; LAMP for S.O.I. Industries, a lighting company; and LOAN for Surety Capital. 
And guess what Smithfield Cos., or HAMS, sells.

   Friday's Market Activity
   Led by bargain-hunting gains in Intel, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, Ashton-Tate and other technology issues that have been dragging the market, the Nasdaq Composite Index Friday jumped 1.87 to 381.60, a 4 1/2-week high. 
The index rose 5.09, or 1.3%, for the week. 

   U.K. issue Carlton Communications declined 3 1/4 to 20 1/2 after the television and movie company said it will pay $780 million for Technicolor Holdings; International Mobile Machines jumped 1 1/8 to 9 after the company's Ultraphone digital radio telephone system won approval for use on some rural phone systems; and surging Nike gained another 1 1/8 to 28 5/8 ahead of an expected earnings announcement.
