   Some late afternoon selling left stock prices
broadly lower Tuesday, frustrating the market's bid to extend its
latest rally.
   Prices opened higher, appearing to take some encouragement from
new government reports that indicated continuing low inflation and
moderate economic growth. But profit-taking eroded the gains as the
day progressed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen nearly
40 points over the past two sessions, wound up falling 6.61 to close
at 2,166.07.
   The widely-watched indicator of blue-chip stocks had been up
nearly 10 points at midday but gave ground steadily in the final
hour of the session.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
652 up, 845 down and 515 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.09 million
shares, down from 162.25 million Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 196.92 million shares.
   As the market opened, the Dow Jones industrials moved up about 14
points during the first few minutes of trading. But the blue-chip
market gauge was unable to sustain the advance, and soon dropped
below its post-crash closing high of 2,183.50 reached Oct. 21.
   ``The early rally was a carryover from yesterday's strength,''
said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Prescott, Ball &amp;
Turben Inc. in Cleveland. ``But the breadth of the market was poor.''
   Before trading began, the government reported the consumer price
index rose 0.3 percent in November, and lowered its estimate of
economic growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent
from 2.6 percent.
   The reports tended to soothe worries that the Federal Reserve
would move quickly to encourage even higher interest rates.
   The bond market rallied, as prices of some long-term issues rose
as much as $9 for every $1,000 in face value and interest rates fell.
   But analysts said profit-taking eroded some of the stock market's
early gains, driving prices lower.
   The skeptics noted that short-term interest rates are hovering
near 9 percent and are making yields on Treasury issues such as
one-year bills attractive compared with the uncertain yields on
stocks.
   Chalasani noted that the Dow Jones industrials have risen about
150 points since mid-November and said he suspects the year-end
rally may ``pretty much be over.''
   But Lawrence R. Helfand, executive vice president at Rodman &amp;
Renshaw Inc. in Chicago, said the some further gains could be in
store if stocks other than the blue-chip issues attract some buying
interest.
   Inco Ltd., the Canadian metals mining company which began trading
ex-dividend recently, was the most active issue on the NYSE, rising
1\ to 26[. A company spokesman, Kurt Barnes, declined to speculate
about reasons for the price rise or activity.
   Among other active issues, J.P. Morgan lost { to 35}, Tiger
International slipped [ to 19} and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
fell { to 29{.
   International Business Machines rose { to 123\ and Hewlett
Packard rose 1{ to 53. But two other technology companies fell as
Digital Equipment lost 1 to 94 and Honeywell slipped \ to 60.
   First Fidelity Bancorp fell 1} to 26[. The company announced last
week it expected to lose $145 million to $190 million in the current
quarter, and some analysts suspect the company's financial problems
may not be over.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $8.975 billion, or 0.33
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.64 to 155.74.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.46 to 320.51, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index lost 1.44 tp 277.47.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.34 to 376.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 299.67, up 0.97.
