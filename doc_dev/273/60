<TEXT>     The Dow Jones industrial average lost 32.67 points, or a bit more than 1
percent, to 2,881.19, and a broader measure, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500,
dropped about the same.;    Two measurements of smaller stocks, the NASDAQ
composite index and the American Stock Exchange's market-value index, slid
about a third as much.;    Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds were mixed in light
trading Monday. The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell  point or $1.88 per
$1,000 in face amount at closing.;    The bond's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from price, rose to 8.25 percent, up from 8.24 percent last
Thursday.;    Trading on the Big Board fell to 144 million shares from an
anemic 150.8 million Thursday, the previous trading session; the exchanges
were closed on Good Friday.;    Declines led advances about 5 to 3, and while
two stocks dropped to new lows, 75 reached new highs.;    Digital Equipment
slumped 4 1/4 in heavy trading to 63 7/8, after analysts trimmed their
earnings estimates. The computer maker said the recession had hurt its
business.;    IBM, which said last week that it would eliminate more than
10,000 jobs, fell 1 5/8 to 112 1/4, also in heavy trading, after IBM Japan
Ltd. said profits fell 18.8 percent last year.;    Showing that the smaller
stocks were holding up extremely well for the most part, even in a down
market, the Russell 2000, the small-stock index, fell 0.4 percent to 170.31,
down 0.69.;    Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said heavy
computer-driven selling lopped nearly 14 points off the Dow.; LOCAL STOCKS;
