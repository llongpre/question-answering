   Prices closed mixed on Wall Street Monday after
the stock market was unable to hold on to a broad advance prompted
by a better-than-expected earnings report from International
Business Machines Corp.
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 11.26 at 2,763.06
after having been up more than 41 points early in the session.
   Declining issues ran slightly ahead of advancers in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 714 up, 778
down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.81 million
shares, slightly higher than 142.47 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 173.64 million shares.
   The market surged higher at the opening after IBM reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.03 billion, or $1.81 per share, up 9
percent from $950 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue was up 11 percent to $14.18 billion from $12.73 billion.
   The results surpassed most analysts' predictions of earnings per
share of between $1.35 and $1.70.
   Investors moved into the market enthusiastically after hearing
the news _ Big Blue's announcement dispelled some concerns that
corporate profits for the first quarter would be disappointing. The
stock market has been held in check in recent months because of
companies' poor results in 1989.
   The Dow Jones average was up by around 25 points for much of the
day, although the broader market began to retreat. Then, in the
last hour, program selling brought prices even lower.
   Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said
Monday's performance reflected the continuing trend of a
``two-tier'' market, in which traders have more confidence in blue
chip stocks than in the secondary issues.
   Jarrett said a strong performance by IBM accounted for as much
as 9 points of the Dow Jones average's advance _ meaning the
average would have been little changed without the computer giant's
gain.
   IBM led the NYSE most-active list, rising 3} to 110~.
   Earnings reports also affected the performance of other stocks.
Eli Lilly tumbled 1\ to 67\ after releasing first-quarter profit
figures that fell short of analysts' forecasts.
   Banking stocks fell after reporting their first-quarter earnings
declined. Chase Manhattan fell 1| to 27} and J.P. Morgan slipped }
to 34}.
   Among blue chip issues, AT&amp;T was unchanged at 41~, Philip Morris
rose &rsqb; to 42&rsqb;, and General Electric gained } to 66}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $2.917 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.14 to 188.94.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.46 to 400.42, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index picked up 0.40 to close at 344.74.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.39 to 436.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 356.98, off 0.90.
