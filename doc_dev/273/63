   The stock market rolled up a strong advance
Monday, extending its post-crash rally to new heights in buying
supported by ebbing recession worries and continued takeover fever.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 41.54 points to
2,694.99, just 27.43 points shy of the record closing high of
2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987. It also marked the
seventh-highest close ever for the market indicator.
   Most other, broader market measures reached new peaks, having
already surpassed their 1987 tops.
   The stock of UAL Corp. set the mood for the session, soaring 46\
to 210} on reports that investor Marvin Davis of Los Angeles was
readying a $200-a-share-plus bid for the company.
   UAL confirmed that it had received what it called a highly
conditional proposal from Davis and said its directors would meet
Wednesday to consider it.
   The news prompted buying of other airline stocks. Delta Air
Lines climbed 2] to 74{; AMR gained 3{ to 71{; U.S. Air Group rose
1 to 51, and Southwest Airlines was up 1 at 27.
   UAL's runup and its ripple effects on other airline issues sent
the Dow Jones average of 20 transportation stocks up 94.06 points,
or more than 7.5 percent, to 1,344.06.
   In addition, brokers said traders seemed increasingly confident
that a recession could be avoided in the months ahead, following an
unexpectedly strong report from the government Friday on employment
in July.
   The news pushed interest rates higher in the credit markets, but
also evidently calmed worries that had been developing among stock
traders about a possible slump in business conditions and corporate
earnings.
   One apparent beneficiary of that change of sentiment was the
technology group. Hewlett-Packard rose 3[ to 57{; International
Business Machines 1~ to 117], and Digital Equipment 2} to 98.
   In the cyclical basic-industry sector, International Paper
gained 2} to 57; Scott Paper 1\ to 50\; Alcoa 1[ to 72|; Dow
Chemical 2{ to 95{, and Monsanto 3~ to 120.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,054 up, 476 down and 465 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 197.58 million
shares, up from 169.75 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 229.58 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $42.32 billion, or
1.26 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.55 to 194.19.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.12 to 399.26, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 5.49 at 349.41.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 4.31 to 461.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 379.18, up 3.08.
