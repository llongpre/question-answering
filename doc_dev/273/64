There was more good news on the US economy this week, and more
record-breaking gains in blue-chip stocks. Yet, there was also more concern
about interest rates and the outlook for share prices in 1994.
It might seem to odd to say that investors are feeling nervous when they
keep driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average to new record highs, but it is
clear that Wall Street is not entirely confident that the equity markets can
hold their ground at these levels.
Faced with high share price valuations, analysts who believe the markets
will end the year on a positive note have resorted to the less than
inspiring argument that prices will go up because the markets traditionally
fare well in the final few weeks of the year. The failure of the markets'
other main indices - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite, and
the Russell 2000 - to match the Dow's recent performance suggests that
investor morale is not especially deep-rooted, whatever history says about
Christmas-time rallies.
The Dow has been doing well - this week, it twice closed at new highs -
because statistics keep showing that economic growth has been accelerating
faster than many analysts and investors had predicted. To cash in on this
growth, investors have been buying cyclical stocks of companies with
earnings tied to the performance of the economy - and there are a lot of
cyclical stocks in the Dow average.
The Dow's performance contrasts with the recent showing from the Nasdaq,
which is weighted heavily toward technology stocks - and the technology
sector took a big hit this week, dragging the index down with it. The
selling of technology stocks began on Monday when a Merrill Lynch analyst
downgraded his investment ratings of two big semi-conductor companies, Intel
and Motorola.
The analyst did this because he was worried about the prospects for the
semiconductor market in 1994. His judgement appeared to be vindicated later
in the week when the Semiconductor Industry Association's reading of monthly
orders showed an unexpected decline. This sparked fresh selling of stocks
such as Intel, National Semiconductor, Motorola, Texas Instruments, and
Advanced Micro Devices.
Although the Dow was able to shrug off the losses in the technology sector,
any suggestion that semiconductor sales will slow down in 1994 should give
investors cause for concern, because the industry plays such a big part in
the economy's overall growth.
If there is still uncertainty surrounding the outlook for share prices,
analysts remain somewhat surer about where interest rates are headed next
year. The problem is, they are sure rates are going up. What they remain
uncertain about is when rates will rise, and how fast.
Although long-term interest rates fell this week - the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond edged lower from 6.23 per cent to 6.17 per
cent - it was mostly a reaction to further declines in oil prices.
Underlying sentiment in the bond market remains weak because the economy is
strengthening, and the Federal Reserve is expected to react to that strength
by tightening monetary policy some time next year.
The Fed is not going to wait until inflation shows signs of reviving before
tightening policy, either. David Mullins, its vice chairman, said as much at
the start of the week when he talked of the need for 'vigilance' in view of
the latest spurt in economic growth.
Stock market investors are not just worried about rising interest rates
because of the effect they would have on corporate investment and consumer
borrowing. People are also afraid of what a rate hike, particularly an
aggressive rate hike, would do to market sentiment.
Bond prices have been in a declining trend for the past two months so, to a
certain extent, a monetary tightening by the Fed is priced into bonds
already. Stocks, however, have been either breaking records or staying close
to all-time highs. There is simply no room in share prices at the moment to
handle a rate increase. If the Fed decides to launch a pre-emptive, and
solid, strike at inflation by tightening early next year, the stock markets
could take a big hit.
True, the underlying strength of the economy would help to absorb the impact
of the blow, but investors would be worried not so much over what rising
rates might do to the economy as about what they might do to the flow of
investor funds into stocks.
If short-term interest rates rise decisively next year, investors who
shifted billions of dollars out of short-term money market funds into stocks
might just start thinking about doing the reverse.
