   An upbeat attitude about the economy's health
sent the stock market higher Friday, carrying the Dow Jones
industrial average and broader indicators to record heights.
   Activity on Wall Street wound down in the afternoon as traders
began leaving early for the long Labor Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.82 to a new high
of 2,752.09, surpassing the previous peak of 2,743.36 reached Monday
and bringing its gain for the weak to 19.73 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
897 up, 498 down and 561 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.30 million
shares, down from 143.42 million on Thursday.
   A collection of economic reports were open to varying
interpretations but, on balance, financial markets reacted favorably
to the figures.
   A report on the job market, which provided the first glimpse of
economic conditions last month, suggested the economy is growing at
a moderate rate, making the threat of recession seem more remote.
   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate remained
at 5.2 percent in August. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 110,000, a
total that was reduced by about 108,000 due to strikes.
   Separately, a Commerce Department report pointed to a rebound in
momentum after months of sluggish economic activity earlier this
year. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose a modest 0.2
percent in July after registering no gain in June and plunging by
1.3 percent in May, the biggest drop since late 1987 following the
stock market crash.
   Countering the positive economic news was the August survey of
the nation's purchasing managers. The National Association of
Purchasing Management's monthly poll showed lingering weakness in
the industrial side of the economy.
   Bonds rallied on the purchasing managers' assessment and sported
significant gains after an abbreviated pre-holiday session. The
bullishness in the bond market spurred buying enthusiasm in the
stock market.
   General Motors headed the list of actively traded shares on the
Big Board. It added 1 to 50 and more than 2 million shares changed
hands. Other major automakers also posted gains: Ford rose ] to 54\
and Chyrsler gained ] to 27.
   Some of the blue chips contributing to the advance in the Dow
Jones industrial average included: Exxon, up \ to 44; General
Electric, up | to 58\; International Business Machines, up \ to
117]; McDonald's, up \ to 29[; Merck, up [ to 73|; and Philip
Morris, up } to 164{.
   Takeover speculation continued to preoccupy traders. Johnson &amp;
Johnson rose 1[ to 53{ amid what were described as vague takeover
rumors.
   Airline stocks made a comeback from Thursday's selloff. UAL,
parent of United Airlines, jumped 7\ to 287 on word that the pilots
union was preparing to make a bid for the carrier. AMR, owner of
American, rose 1} to 89}.
   Lyphomed gained 1] to 31] in over-the-counter trading. The
company said it has agreed to be bought by Japan's Fujisawa
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., which already owns 30 percent of the drug
manufacturer.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 158.996 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market added $17.3 billion, or 0.50
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.10 to a record 196.37, well above its previous best close of
195.45 registered Monday.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.42 to 405.27, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index finished up 2.28 at 353.73, also a record.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.01 to 471.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 383.96, up 1.77, and above its previous best of
382.24 on Aug. 10.
