   The Dow Jones Industrial Average staged a sparkling
late-afternoon rally that left other stock market measures in
the dust.
   Bond prices rose a bit, as six-month Treasury bill rates
fell to their lowest level -- 5.22% -- in almost five years,
and the dollar fell.

   The Dow Jones industrials spurted 3015.21, up 29.52, in
active trading. But Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose a
more modest 2.19, to 385.78. Declines among over-the-counter
technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index to
515.68, down 1.03.
   Analysts said stock prices rebounded as expected from the
sharp sell-off that followed the Federal Reserve's
interest-rate cut Friday. But buying was concentrated in some
of the Dow Jones industrial stocks: International Business
Machines climbed 3/4 to 103 5/8; General Electric soared 1
7/8 to 69 3/4; Exxon was up 1 1/4 to 59 5/8; Du Pont gained 1
1/8 to 46 3/8; and Procter &amp; Gamble rose 1 1/4 to 84.
   "It was a smattering of things that helped the Dow, but
beyond that the market deserves to be up a little bit after
the `buy on the rumors, sell on the news,' selloff we had
Friday," said Peter Canelo, chief market strategist at County
NatWest. "As long as bond yields continue to come down,
they'll take some of the pressure off the stock market."
   "I'm a less-than-enthusiastic bull at this point," he
said. Despite lower interest rates, the economy remains
sluggish and the outlook for corporate profits is dim. He
said the Fed might consider cutting rates again if the
economy doesn't perk up.
   If the Dow Jones industrials "dipped to the low 2900s, I'd
probably be a buyer," Mr. Canelo said, and if they "rose to
the low 3100s, I'd be a seller."
   Lower U.S. interest rates hurt the dollar. "This is the
continuation of the trend that was put in place last week,"
said Richard Witten, partner in charge of currency sales at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "Money is cheap and probably getting
cheaper."
   The U.S. currency has fallen nearly 4% during the past six
trading days and is down nearly 9% from highs reached Aug. 19
at the time of the coup attempt in the Soviet Union. Given
that interest rates in other countries are much higher than
those in the U.S., some traders said they were surprised the
dollar hadn't fallen further.
   In the short run, Mr. Witten predicted the dollar would
trade possibly as low as 1.63 marks and in the range of 130
to 132 yen.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices climbed in active trading. Volume totaled
almost 172 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange,
where 912 issues advanced and 704 fell.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose modestly. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond gained 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000
face amount. The yield on the issue fell to 7.92%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6725 marks and 133.55 yen, compared with
1.6892 marks and 134.90 yen Friday.
