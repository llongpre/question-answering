   The Dow Jones industrial average made a
near-miss run at a record high Thursday as the stock market kept
climbing in turbulent trading.
   With about a half hour to go in the session a wave of buying
pushed Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips past the record closing
high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   But then it settled back to finish at 2,712.63, up 26.55 from
Wednesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
838 up, 653 down and 511 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 198.66 million
shares, against 209.90 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 231.69 million shares.
   Most broader market indicators have already surpassed their 1987
peaks in the past few weeks.
   Brokers said many investors were waiting for the venerable Dow
to join them, however, in a kind of official certification that
stocks had fully recovered from the '87 crash.
   At the same time, some traders apparently opted late in the
session to use the near-record levels in the Dow as an opportune
occasion to cash in on the market's recent gains.
   Brisk activity in airline issues and other stocks reported or
rumored to be takeover candidates helped keep the pot bubbling.
   UAL, which said it would explore a wide range of options in
light of a takeover bid from investor Marvin Davis, climbed 7\ to
251[. The stock has soared 86| points this week.
   Among other prominent airline issues, AMR dropped back ] to 76{
and Delta Air Lines was unchanged at 79].
   Paramount Communications, widely discussed as a possible
acquisition target, moved up } to 62~.
   Elsewhere, Procter &amp; Gamble jumped 5] to 123|, making a
substantial contribution to the Dow Jones industrials' gain. The
company reported higher quarterly earnings.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up 1[
at 51}; Philip Morris, up 2} at 163\; International Business
Machines, up ] at 117{; United Technologies, up ] at 54{, and
DuPont, up ] at 118].
   Computer Associates International, the most active NYSE issue,
tumbled 2] to 17, and Cullinet Software fell 1[ to 8\. The
companies cited adverse effects on their current results stemming
from delays in their proposed merger.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $13.48 billion, or
0.40 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .77 to 193.97.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.70 to 398.56, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.31 at 348.25.

1.14 to 463.55. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 382.24, up 1.09.
