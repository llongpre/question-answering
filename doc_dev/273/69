<LEADPARA>  Though there are still 2 1/2 months left to go in 1991, one category of stocks
has pretty well locked up the "comeback of the year" award on Wall Street.;  
The group in question is emerging growth stocks -- relatively small companies
with big promise.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Their overwhelming lead over their larger counterparts shows up in the
performance of the NASDAQ composite index for the Over-the-Counter market,
where many of these up-and-comers trade.;   Through the first nine months of
the year, the NASDAQ index jumped 40.94 percent, more than doubling the 17.46
percent gain recorded by Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index and the
14.55 percent advance posted by the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials.;  
Longtime followers of emerging growth stocks are quick to point out that this
year's dazzling run has merely recouped ground lost to the blue chips over the
past several years. By most gauges, junior growth issues had been lagging
behind the big-name stocks ever since 1983.;   In 1990, for example, indexes
of small-capitalization stocks fell about twice as much as the S&amp;P 500's
decline of 11 percent.;   The net result: In a race from the end of 1987
through August of this year, reports the Securities Industry Association,
these two horses of vastly different running styles wound up running neck and
neck.;   Over that span, the trade group says, the Dow Jones industrials, the
S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ composite all showed gains of 57 percent to 60
percent.;   Which one to bet on now? After the small stocks' run of late,
analysts concede, it wouldn't be surprising to see them take at least a pause
for breath. But many of them argue that emerging growth is still the place to
be.;   "Some investors are beginning to worry about the small-cap rally in
place since November 1990," said Claudia Mott, an analyst at Prudential
Securities. "The fear is that small-cap stocks are nearing a crisis point -- a
la 1983.;   "Granted, a number of individual issues have reached dramatic
premiums to the market and may be a tad pricey, but the broad small-cap
indexes are still a far cry from 1983.";   Declared Stan Weinstein, publisher
of the Professional Tape Reader advisory, "We expect this divergent action,
with secondary issues far outperforming their big-cap brethren, to continue
for several more months." The sluggish behavior of the economy as it bids to
recover from the recession is working strongly in the small stocks' favor,
emerging-growth partisans argue.;   "Small growth companies may reasonably be
expected to post superior earnings gains in 1991 and beyond," said Jack
Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest Inc., a brokerage firm based in
Hartford, Conn.;   "These companies typically are able to generate strong
revenue gain through proprietary new products and/or burgeoning new markets
outside this country, which will transcend the effects of the currently
lackluster economic environment.;   "Looking longer-term, the S&amp;P 500
companies may have difficulty in matching their yearly 7 1/2 percent historic
rate of earnings growth over the next five to 10 years.;   "Domestic economic
growth would do well to average 2 percent per year over this period as the
nation replenishes depleted savings levels and pays down burdensome debt.;  
"In contrast, many small companies have the potential to grow earnings at 15
percent per year or more over the next five years."  </TEXT>
