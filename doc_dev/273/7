   Reuters Information Services Inc. will provide the news service of a competitor, Dow Jones &amp; Co., to some U.S. customers of its new Equities 2000 stock quotation system. 

   At the request of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., Reuters's largest North American customer, Reuters and Dow Jones agreed to cooperate on a case-by-case basis, allowing Equities 2000 customers to receive the Dow Jones News Service on the Reuters computer terminal. 

   Reuters's customers who want the Dow Jones News Service will get it in addition to Reuters's own news service, which is part of the Equities 2000 package. 
Customers will pay the regular fee for the Reuters service, and an additional fee for the Dow Jones service. 

   Reuters, a unit of Reuters Holdings PLC in London, will not be an official vendor of the Dow Jones News Service, as several other stock quotation systems are. 
Robert Williams, director of sales for Dow Jones News Service, said Dow Jones will deliver the line to customers' offices, and then Reuters will be responsible for hooking it up to the Equities 2000 system. 

   Robert Crooke, media relations manager for Reuters North America, said Reuters isn't actively selling the Dow Jones service, "but it's not something we faint when we hear a request for." 
Mr. Crooke said if a customer requests such an arrangement, "neither Reuters nor Dow Jones would stand in the way." 

   In addition to the news service, New York-based Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine and other periodicals and community newspapers. 
It also owns 56% of Telerate Inc., which provides computerized financial information on global markets. 
Customers of Telerate receive the Dow Jones News Service as part of the package.
