   The stock market surged Wednesday, reversing a
five-session slide and ending the month on a bright note as
interest rate concerns subsided.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the day at
2,590.54, up 47.30 points. The Dow Jones industrials fell 162.66
points, or 5.9 percent, during January, despite starting the year
with a gain of 56.95 points that pushed the index to an all-time
high of 2,810.15 on Jan. 2.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by a margin of about 5 to 2
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,116 issues up, 449 down and 411 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 189.66 million
shares, up from 186.03 million in the previous session.
   Stocks rallied at the opening on what some Wall Street analysts
called a technical bounce amid oversold conditions, then moved
steadily higher throughout the session. It was the first gain in
five sessions for the Dow Jones industrials, which had fallen more
than 72 points since last Wednesday.
   ``I don't think this is the start of an uptrend. This is
properly termed a technical bounce,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior
vice president at First Albany Corp.
   Wall Street analysts said the catalyst for the rally was the
bond market's strength despite an unexpected 0.8 percent rise in
the December index of leading indicators. Consensus expectations
were for a rise of about 0.5 percent.
   The index, composed of 11 statistics designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months into the future, was the
latest indication that the economy, while weak, can avoid an actual
decline in growth _ or recession.
   Ordinarily the report would have been taken by the bond market
as a signal that the Federal Reserve would continue to push
interest rates higher, which would lower bond prices _ a negative
for the credit market, traders said.
   ``The bond market ignored the strong data suggesting to some
that interest rates might have peaked,'' Johnson said.
   Theodore Tung, senior vice president with National City Corp. in
Cleveland, said interest-rate worries, which have plagued the
market in recent days, have now been discounted in the market.
   ``As interest rate concerns subside, stocks are doing better,''
Tung said. ``It's all keyed to interest rates.''
   Analysts said reports that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
denied he might resign as head of the communist party eased market
jitters early in the day. The television report Tuesday jolted the
financial markets and sent the dollar soaring.
   Despite the rally, several analysts said a combination of
worries could still send the market lower in coming days _
including whether U.S. interest rates are attractive enough to lure
foreign investors to buy U.S. securities.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 221.76 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $50.308 billion, or 1.62
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
3.07 to 181.50.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, AT&amp;T advanced 1&lsqb; to
38~, Philip Morris gained ~ to 37~ on better-than-expected earnings
and IBM added 1&rsqb; to 98|.
   Chase Manhattan gained &rsqb; to 30}, Bank of New England rose \ to
4~, and Federal National Mortgage went up 2 to 31\, among
interest-rate sensitive stocks.
   Dow Chemical, whose fourth-quarter earnings fell short of
expectations, dropped 1} to 63~, Exxon was unchanged at 47 and
Occidental Petroleum, the most active stock, ended unchanged at 26|.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.77 to 378.69, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index added 6.10 to 329.08.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
5.09 to 415.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 350.07, up 4.57.
