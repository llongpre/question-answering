   A bevy of positive developments, most notably an
increase in General Motors' dividend, reinvigorated Wall Street
Tuesday and sent stock prices sharply higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 26.07 to 2,347.14,
its highest close since the October 1987 crash. The last time the
average closed higher was Oct. 15, 1987, two trading days before the
crash, when it stood at 2,355.09.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declilners by about 11 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,095 stocks rising, 425 falling and 461 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 217.26 million
shares, up from 150.98 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 264.07 million shares.
   Analysts said a variety of factors revived the market after a
five-session pause.
   A major impetus came from GM's announcement that it was splitting
its stock and sharply raising its dividend. Analysts said the
automaker's action indicated the company had confidence in the
market, and its optimism proved to be infectious.
   GM, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, soared 4] to
93~ in heavy trading. The jump accounted for 6.25 points of the gain
in the Dow Jones average.
   Another surging stock that lent support to the rest of the market
was Union Carbide, which jumped 2[ to 30[ and was the most actively
traded issue on the NYSE.
   Carbide, often the subject of takeover rumors, was once again
said to be a target, but analysts said a chunk of the buying Tuesday
came from investors who wanted to take advantage of the chemical
company's upcoming dividend.
   Jack Baker, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said Wall Street had expected the Federal Reserve to raise its
discount rate Tuesday, but when the anticipated hike failed to
materialize, stocks rallied further.
   Other factors contributing to the advance were the vote by
Congress to kill a pay raise for House and Senate members and top
Bush administration officials, and positive reaction to President
Bush's announcement Monday of a bailout plan for the savings and
loan industry.
   ``You couldn't get much more positive news across the board,''
Baker said.
   Some of Wall Street's recent gains have come from its own upward
momentum as investors have jumped into the market to avoid missing
the rally.
   Such was the case again Tuesday, said Alfred E. Goldman, a market
analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Tuesday's developments ``created all kinds of intestinal problems
for those on the sidelines,'' Goldman said.
   Goldman said the market appeared to have returned to an upward
track following its pause, which included a 10-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average on Monday.
   ``The market was ripe for a good rally,'' he said, and predicted
more gains before the president delivers his budget message to
Congress in a speech Thursday night.
   Big gainers Tuesday included Ford Motor, up 1[ to 55~, and IBM,
up 1 to 127|.
   A big loser was Burlington Resources, which fell 2} to 46]. On
Monday, the stock soared 10 points after Pennzoil said it acquired 8
percent of the company's shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $30.09 billion, or 1.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.83 to 168.02.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index closed up 3.82 to 346.41, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 3.59 to 299.63.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was up
3.19 to 409.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index picked up 1.90 to close at 326.38.
