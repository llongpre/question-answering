An Appraisal: Rally's Momentum
And Its Breadth Impress Analysts

   Wall Street professionals were unexcited about the Dow Jones Industrial Average exceeding 2000 for the first time, but many have been surprised by the momentum and the breadth of the New Year's rally. 

   "This (rally) started as bargain-hunting, and the momentum of the market brought in a lot of investors," says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in New York. 

   In each of the past six sessions, well over 1,000 Big Board issues have gained in price. 
Robert Colby, a technical analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., says the total number of daily advancing issues so far this year exceeds that of the August 1982 surge when this bull market got rolling and that of its August 1984 "liftoff" phase. 

   "This is certainly one for the record books," Mr. Colby says. 

   The number of gainers in the over-the-counter market, which has so far outperformed the blue-chip issues, has been equally impressive. 

   The rally, in fact, has been a tide lifting many boats. 
There is an unusual mix among the gainers, with economically sensitive issues such as forest products and toy stocks advancing as well as less cyclical issues such as brewers and specialty retailers. 

   Even the worst-performing industry groups have little to lament; not one of the 100 groups followed by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lost ground last week. 

   Market watchers say this rally has been so broad because an unusually large number of stocks were affected by tax selling late last year. 
Investors sold losers in their portfolios as well as many stocks that had made hefty gains, to take advantage of the 20% capital gains tax rate before it was increased Jan. 1. 
But the sellers were all gone by the first session of 1987, traders say. 

   Uncertainty about the economy, interest rates and the new tax law didn't encourage aggressive buying late in 1986. 
Many portfolio managers just allowed new funds to accumulate, and others took profits. 

   But with the turn of the calendar, Dan Marciano, head of listed equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities, saw "money coming into the market." 

   "People were afraid to jeopardize their gains for the year" in December, Mr. Marciano says. 
"But it's easier to make bold decisions in January." 

   Smaller-capitalization stocks are bounding forward as they always do when tax selling abates. 
But some market watchers say this could be just the beginning of a prolonged advance as investors increasingly recognize value among the little stocks. 
Many small growth-company stocks currently are valued at the same level as blue-chips, based on price/earnings ratios; yet the shares of rapidly growing companies traditionally have sold at a 50% premium to the market, analysts say. 

   "There are a lot of smart investors out there, and they're nibbling away at perceived values," Mr. Lipper says. 

   Friday's Market Activity
   Stock prices posted only modest gains, but they were enough to keep the market's winning streak intact. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record 2005.91, an increase of 3.66 for the day, 78.59 for the week and 109.95 for the first six sessions of 1987. 
The average finished at a record level every day last week. 

   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.45 to 258.73, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.84 to 148.39. 
Both of those also were record closing levels. 

   After a sluggish start Friday, stocks rallied along with bond prices until a bout of profit-taking in the final hour pared some gains. 

   Some technology, drug, retailing, bank and paper stocks were hit by profit-takers. 
Chemicals and oils were mostly higher. 

   ICN Pharmaceuticals skidded 4 to 21 1/4 after gaining 3 1/8 Thursday. 
The company said its drug Ribavirin, developed by its 50%-owned Viratek affiliate, showed some effectiveness in preventing acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. 
But analysts said the tests weren't as broad as earlier believed. 
Viratek tumbled 5 to 71 in OTC trading. 

   MCA rose 1 1/2 to 44. 
A source close to Walt Disney Productions said Disney was studying the value of MCA's film library. 

   Owens-Illinois rose 1 1/2 to 55 1/4. 
There were rumors of a new bid surpassing the $55-a-share leveraged buyout proposed last month by Kolhberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 

   Centerior Energy rose 1/2 to 24 3/4 on more than 5.4 million shares. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a full-power license to the utility's Shearon nuclear plant in North Carolina.
