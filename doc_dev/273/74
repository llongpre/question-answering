   The stock market began the first week of the new year with a bell-ringer rally as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rode its biggest daily advance ever to a record close. 

   The average soared 44.01 to 1971.32, surpassing its previous record of 1955.57, established Dec. 2. 
Yesterday's gain exceeded the previous record one-day advance of 43.41, posted Nov. 3, 1982, when the current bull market was in its infancy. 

   While few stock market participants were ready to say that the industrial average will sail easily through 2000, most couldn't stop talking about how broad yesterday's advance was. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,613 issues advanced while just 171 declined and 236 were unchanged. 

   Laszlo Birinyi, a market strategist with Salomon Brothers in New York, said yesterday was probably the first day in Big Board history that more than 1,600 issues advanced. 

   The Big Board composite index rose 3.38 to 144.29, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index added 5.74 to 252.19. 
That's 1.81 points shy of the record 254.00, also set Dec. 2. 
Volume on the Big Board almost doubled to 181.9 million shares from 91.9 million shares Friday. 

   Higher bond prices, a corresponding decline in interest rates, a rebound by the recently sagging dollar and lower crude oil and other commodity prices contributed to the rally, which began with the opening bell. 
Buy programs linked to strategies using stock-index futures and options and short-covering by investors who had previously sold borrowed shares contributed to the buying demand, traders said. 

   But most analysts and traders said one of the biggest reasons for the rally, as well as Friday's advance of 31.36 points, was that investors were no longer selling for tax reasons. 
Selling to capture both gains and losses before year-end 1986 and before the tax law changes became effective last Thursday severely depressed stock prices in the past few weeks. 

   Mr. Birinyi said that $496 million was committed to the stock market yesterday, with institutional blocks of 10,000 shares or more accounting for 49.3% of the volume. 
While substantial, the amount of money committed to the market was far less than the $639 million that flowed in when the industrial average rose 43.03 Dec. 2. 

   Mr. Birinyi said he thinks there's more money in the hands of individual and institutional investors to fuel more than just a two-day advance. 

   Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, said the market's action Friday and yesterday was almost the opposite of late December's trading, when many portfolio managers, eager to protect their 1986 gains, had little desire to buy stocks and take risks so late in the year. 
"Now there's no incentive to keep selling. 
With the market beginning to rise, investors are now more reluctant than ever to sell," he said. 

   Yet he and other analysts are a bit skeptical about the staying power of this rally. 
A two-day rally "doesn't eliminate the nine months when the stock market was deteriorating internally," said Alfred Goldman, a technical analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, referring to the lag by smaller-capitalization issues since last spring. 
Yesterday, however, Nasdaq's OTC composite index posted its biggest one-day gain. 

   Mr. Goldman added that the outlook for corporate profits and economic growth remains far from robust, even though most economists don't see a recession this year. 

   Some of the best-performing groups in the advance lagged through much of the final months of 1986, including toy manufacturers, steel, thrifts, insurance and entertainment, Mr. Birinyi said. 

   Technology issues -- including computer and office equipment stocks -- also took part in the explosive rally. 
International Business Machines rose 1 5/8 to 123 5/8, Digital Equipment added 1 5/8 to 107 3/8, Unisys gained 3 1/2 to 85 1/4, NCR moved up 2 to 46 7/8, Cray Research advanced 3 1/4 to 85 1/4 and Xerox gained 1 7/8 to 61 1/2. 
Some software stocks also advanced: Microsoft jumped 2 3/4 to 50 1/2 and Lotus was up 1 1/8 to 50 3/4. 

   Several semiconductor stocks participated in the rally, confounding some shortsellers who believe these stocks are expensive. 
Texas Instruments rose 1 7/8 to 119 3/8, Intel rose 1/4 to 21 1/2 and Advanced Micro Devices added 1/8 to 14 1/8. 

   Rockwell International rose 1 3/8 to 48. 
The company plans to issue a new class of common stock, to be called Class A, entitling holders to 10 votes a share. 
The new class is seen as a way to thwart unwanted takeover attempts. 
The company said the issuance of Class A is an appropriate step in the current environment, "where disruptive tactics have become commonplace." 

   Drug issues were big gainers. 
Merck rose 2 3/4 to 128 3/4, Upjohn gained 2 3/4 to 98, Eli Lilly moved up 1 3/4 to 76, Syntex added 2 1/4 to 60 1/2 and Pfizer rose 1 5/8 to 63 5/8. 

   Hazleton Laboratories surged 5 5/8 to 28 7/8. 
Corning Glass Works said late Friday that it agreed to acquire Hazleton at $30 a share. 
Corning rose 3/4 to 56 3/8. 

   Auto issues moved higher. 
The big three domestic makers reported higher car sales for mid-December. 

   Bank stocks, benefiting from the interest-rate drop yesterday, rose handsomely. 
J.P. Morgan gained 3 1/4 to 87 3/8, Citicorp moved up 1 1/4 to 55 1/4, Chase Manhattan rose 1 1/4 to 37 1/4 and Bankers Trust advanced 7/8 to 47 1/2. 
Several regional bank issues also advanced: Bank of Boston added 2 to 42 3/8 in active trading, Security Pacific rose 7/8 to 35 3/4 and Wells Fargo gained 1 7/8 to 104 3/8. 

   American Express gained 1 7/8 to 59 3/4 on trading of 1.3 million shares. 
The stock was reportedly recommended by Prudential-Bache Securities, and Rodney Schwartz, an analyst with PaineWebber, reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock, calling it the cheapest in the financial services group. 

   Walt Disney rose 2 3/4 to 47 5/8 in active trading. 
Two Wall Street analysts told their clients that they see strong earnings growth for the company. 
Merrill Lynch analyst Hal Vogel told Dow Jones News Service that he raised his earnings estimate for the year ending September to $2.40 a share from $2.30 Toys "R" Us moved up 2 3/8 to 31 1/2 on 1.2 million shares. 
The toy retailer said its sales for its eight-week Christmas season rose 26.8% from a year earlier. 

   Tandy gained 1 1/4 to 45. 
The company said its December consolidated sales and operating revenue rose 23%, with sales of U.S. retail stores open more than a year rising 18% last month.
