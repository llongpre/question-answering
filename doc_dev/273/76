   It is no easy undertaking, but the stock market
has been doing its best lately to dim investors' memories of the
1987 crash.
   In the early days of 1989, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials has rallied to its highest levels since the collapse.
   In fact, the Dow has moved to within hailing distance of its
2,246.74 close on Friday, Oct. 16 _ the session before it took a
508-point drop on Black Monday.
   If the Dow were to complete the mission of recouping its Black
Monday loss, it would naturally serve as a morale booster on Wall
Street. But the prospect hasn't stirred up much excitement just yet.
   For one thing, legions of the smaller stocks not represented in
the Dow remain well below their pre-Black Monday levels.
   The industrial average itself still stands more than 500 points
below its peak of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Furthermore, the market's latest advance has failed to dazzle
some of the Street's chart-watching analysts.
   ``We would caution against characterizing this as a chart
breakout that would suggest significantly higher levels,'' said
Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   As it moved to a new post-crash high, Zinder pointed out, the Dow
remained within the confines of a gradually rising trend that has
been in force for a year.
   The skeptics also wonder how far stock prices can go while
interest rates are high and rising.
   Widespread expectations persist in the financial world that the
Federal Reserve will soon raise its discount rate, the charge it
sets on loans to private banks, from the 6{ percent level that has
prevailed since last summer.
   Such a move would mark the third consecutive increase in a
sequence dating back to September of 1987.
   That, in turn, would invoke a warning indicator known as the
``three steps and a stumble'' rule developed years ago by the widely
respected analyst Edson Gould.
   Under this rule, three discount rate increases in a row signal a
commitment by the Fed to tighter credit that is stringent enough to
put the stock market in jeopardy.
   ``One thing which has never changed and which never will change,
in my opinion, is that sharply rising interest rates will eventually
cause a sharply declining stock market,'' asserted Charles LaLoggia,
a Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser.
   Despite such concerns, the Dow Jones industrials rose 25.72
points to 2,194.29 in the four sessions that made up the first
trading week of the year.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.70 to
157.96; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 3.36 to 384.74, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 5.39 at 311.40.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 153.39 million shares a day, up
from 114.15 million the week before.
   ``One of the first lessons a new investor learns is that the
stock market dislikes rising interest rates,'' said James Stack,
whose InvesTech advisory letter is published in Whitefish, Mont.
   ``Not only does it give competing investments such as bonds and
money market funds an edge, but higher rates eventually slow the
economy. That leads to lower corporate profits.
   ``Bull markets rarely occur without favorable monetary
conditions. It's very unusual for investors to mount a sustainable
long-term advance while the Federal Reserve is putting on the
brakes.''
