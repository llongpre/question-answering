   A late burst of buying helped stocks pare some early losses, but worries about rising interest rates and increased hostilities in the Persian Gulf kept many investors on the sidelines yesterday. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped below the 2000 mark as trading got under way, ended the day off 5.81, at 2008.12. 
Traders said only in the final hour did a few noticeable buyers step into the market. 

   "Twiddling thumbs seems to be the name of the game here," said Paul Hennessey, a vice president of trading at Boston Co., Boston. 
"There's just no investors out there at the moment." 

   Bond prices sank and oil prices jumped as tensions between the U.S. and Iran heated up. 
The U.S. attacked several Iranian oil platforms in the Persian Gulf, and later fired on Iranian warships in the area. 
The hostilities flared up after a mine, allegedly an Iranian one, exploded and crippled a U.S. frigate last week. 

   Investors already weren't starting the week with much enthusiasm for buying stocks, especially because recent news has been less than bullish. 
They remain unsettled following last week's news of a larger-than-expected February trade deficit and a jump in March producer prices. 

   The broader market averages posted mild setbacks as well. 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.56 to 259.21 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased 0.23 to 146.77. 
Some 771 issues advanced on the Big Board and 765 fell. 

   The American Stock Exchange index, which includes a large percentage of energy issues, added 1.68 to 300.92 and the over-the-counter market's Nasdaq OTC Composite Index gained 1.21 to 375.11. 

   The flurry of trading that accompanied the market's retreat last Thursday and modest rebound Friday slowed to a relative trickle yesterday. 
Big Board volume totaled 144.7 million shares, compared with 234.2 million Friday. 
Traders said the pace of trading slowed as yesterday's session progressed. 

   Market observers don't see much that could shake the Dow Jones Industrial Average out of the trading range -- roughly between 1700 and 2100 -- where it has been locked since the October crash. 
However, a continued rise in interest rates could change the market for the worse. 

   Since the trade report last Thursday, yields on long-term Treasury issues have moved up more than 25 basis points to just over 9%, their highest levels since midJanuary. 
There is also a growing belief that the Federal Reserve may be forced to tighten monetary policy to support the dollar, which would force rates even higher. 

   John Brooks, a managing director at Marshall &amp; Co., Atlanta, said the jump in rates as well as the plunge of more than 101 points in the industrial average last Thursday "obviously scared" a lot of people back to the sidelines. 
Fredric E. Russell, who heads a Tulsa, Okla., money management firm bearing his name, added that the market's relentless volatility is also very unnerving for investors. 

   Foreign oil issues were higher following news of unrest in the Persian Gulf. 
British Petroleum jumped 1 3/4 to 63 3/8; Royal Dutch Petroleum advanced 1 3/4 to 123 3/4, and Shell Transport gained 1 5/8 to 81 3/4. 

   But stocks of major U.S. oil producers were mixed. 
Amoco rose 7/8 to 78 3/8; Chevron lost 1/2 to 47 5/8, and Amerada Hess added 3/4 to 30. 

   Sears Roebuck, which reported that net income fell to 47 cents a share in the first quarter from 75 cents a year ago, fell 1/2 to 34 3/8. 

   Genentech lost 1 3/8 to 34 although the company reported first-quarter net income of 18 cents a share, up from six cents a year earlier. 
Other companies reporting higher quarterly earnings included Chase Manhattan, up 1/8 to 25 1/8; Pfizer, down 7/8 to 58 1/4; W.R. Grace, up 1 1/4 to 27 1/4; NCR, unchanged at 60 1/4, and Apple Computer, up 1/2 to 40. 

   Irving Bank dropped 1 to 60 3/8 on news that Banca Commerciale Italiana has become the "white knight" in Irving's battle against a hostile takeover bid from Bank of New York. 
The Italian bank agreed to acquire about 51% of Irving's common stock for $65 a share. 

   But Irving didn't stop with finding a white knight. 
The bank also said it plans to sell certain assets and pay a special dividend of $10 a share from funds generated by the sales, and boosted its common dividend to $1.125 a share from 60.5 cents. 
Bank of New York added 1 to 31 5/8. 

   Armtek climbed 2 to 30 1/8. 
Italy's Pirelli group, which recently lost out in a bid for Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber, agreed to buy Armtek's Armstrong Tire unit for $190 million. 
Armtek said it will retain certain assets and liabilities associated with Armstrong and plans to sell the assets "as quickly as possible." 

   MCA advanced 3/4 to 45 3/4. 
Metromedia Chairman John Kluge is reportedly considering a friendly takeover bid for the company. 

   Facet Enterprises surged 3 1/2 to 31 3/8 after Pennzoil's agreement to acquire the company for $32 a share. 
The bid tops an earlier offer of $27.50 a share from Prospect Group, which has been extended until 5 p.m. EDT today. 
Pennzoil eased 1/2 to 74 1/2, while Prospect added 1/4 to 7 1/4 in OTC trading. 

   F.W. Woolworth added 2 to 55 on speculation that the Haft family was readying a $65-a-share takeover offer for the company. 
Sources close to the Hafts, who own Dart Group, told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that the rumors were false. 
A partnership controlled by Dart Chairman Herbert Haft is free to buy as much as 15% of Woolworth's stock under a filing made earlier this month, which triggered a surge in the stock's price. 

   CNW added 3/8 to 23 1/4. 
The company said a group headed by John Haley, an executive with a short-line railroad company, plans a proxy fight for four board seats. 

   Long Island Lighting moved up 1/2 to 8 1/2. 
The utility rejected a takeover offer of $8.75 a share, or about $962.5 million, from the Long Island Power Authority. 

   RTE Corp. rose 2 to 38. 
The company rejected a $33-a-share tender offer from Mark IV Industries as inadequate. 
Mark IV fell 1/4 to 11 5/8.
