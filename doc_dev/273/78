   The stock market rang up its fourth straight
gain Friday with a strong advance that carried the Dow Jones
industrial average to a new high since the October crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 28.02 points to
2,090.19, bringing its gain for the week to 102.13 points.

bonds rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting
their yields in the 8.7-8.75 percent range.
   Analysts said traders were anticipating the possibility of
favorable news next week on the dollar and international trade. It
could come, they say, from a meeting of the so-called Group of
Seven industrialized nations in Washington, or from the Commerce
Department's monthly report on the U.S. trade balance for February.
   Advance estimates call for the trade data to show continuing
improvement from the record levels it reached last fall.
