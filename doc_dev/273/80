   The stock market hit a post-crash high Tuesday
in its sixth straight advance, helped by a late wave of
computerized buying.
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged to close firmly above
the 2,100 mark for the first time since the stock market collapsed
almost six months ago. Computer-triggered buy programs, a firmer
dollar and rebounding bond prices all were credited with spurring
the advance.
   The Dow average of 30 industrials jumped 14.09 points to
2,110.08, bringing its gain in the week-old rally to a total of
about 130 points. Broader market gauges also moved upward.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 879 up, 621 down and 471 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 140.40 million shares, against 146.37
million shares in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index
gained 0.72 to 153.19.
   Analysts noted that volume remained extremely light, initially
indicating a lack of investor enthusiasm but then serving to
accentuate the move upward once buyers stepped in.
   Stocks were mixed early in the session, and the market appeared
to lack direction.
   The Dow average tentatively touched 2,100 around noon but
quickly retreated. It was not until the key market barometer held
above that level in mid-afternoon that investors discarded their
inhibitions over equities.
   ``When the Dow went above 2,100 decisively, it attracted new
buyers,'' said Michael Metz, a vice president and technical analyst
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The 2,100 mark had become somewhat of a psychological barrier.
The Dow average flirted with that level on several recent
occasions, but investors seemed reluctant to make it stick.
   ``A lot of market watchers are getting nervous that they missed
something on the upside,'' Metz said referring to the many
investors who sat on the sidelines awaiting fresh economic data due
out later this week.
   ``A lot of people have missed this move,'' he said.
   Some inactive investors hoped the Commerce Department's release
of February's merchandise trade data on Thursday would lend clues
to the state of the economy.
   Many were playing it ``close to the vest until they see some
direction from the numbers coming out,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris, Upham &amp; Co.
   Besides the trade figures, retail sales figures were due out
Wednesday, the same day the so-called Group of Seven industrialized
nations was set to hold a meeting that could have implications for
the dollar.
   Among actively traded issues, Honda Motor was the exception in
an otherwise lackluster auto sector, jumping 4 to 147{.
   Aircraft issues were mixed. Boeing was unchanged at 47]. The
Federal Aviation Administration said it would conduct an
investigation into alleged defects in the some of the company's
wide-body jets.
   Electronic issues were mostly higher, with Honeywell up 1] to
70; Kyocera up 2\ to 90, and Matsushita up 3] to 226~.
   Oil stocks were widely higher, with Chevron up 1{ to 50}, Mobil
up 1[ to 49[ and Atlantic Richfield up 1[ to 90]. Oil prices hit a
four-month high in the second day of a rally inspired by OPEC
efforts to rein in supplies.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $12.47 billion, or
0.47 percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 171.75 million shares.
   Standard &amp; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.45 to 316.16,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.21 to 271.37.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.90
to 306.59. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 383.38, up 0.86.
