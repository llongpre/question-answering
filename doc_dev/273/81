   The stock market edged downward Tuesday, losing
ground in late trading after rallying on optimism the federal
budget deficit would decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 12.13 points
on Monday, finished down 2.72 points to 2,842.33.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances slightly on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 752 down, 706 up and 529 unchanged. Volume on
the Big Board totaled 141.42 million shares, up from 133.10 million
shares the previous session.
   President Bush said Tuesday morning that higher tax revenues
would be a necessary part of any plan to shrink the deficit. His
statement was issued after a breakfast meeting held with
congressional leaders to review the status of negotiations over the
growing deficit.
   Budget negotiators generally agree they need to reduce the
deficit by $45 billion to $60 billion in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.
   Prices for bonds and stocks increased on news of Bush's
statement, as investors gained hope that it meant the deficit may
decline. A lower deficit eases pressure on interest rates by
lowering the amount of money the federal government must borrow.
   ``I think initially, the market rallied very strongly on that
basis,'' said Gordon L. Smith, managing director of Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons Inc. The Dow Jones industrial average swelled by more than 22
points in the first half-hour of trading.
   But it fell back by noon as some of the weight of Bush's remark
wore off, analysts said. A late afternoon selloff pushed the Dow
average and other indices back into negative territory.
   Some analysts said Tuesday's gains were an adjustment after the
market's losses in the last two sessions. The market had slipped
both Friday and Monday over concern about higher interest rates and
weaker corporate earnings.
   Caterpillar lost another 6 on top of Monday's 5-point decline,
falling to 52{ in heavy trading. Caterpillar said Monday it was
expecting sharply lower earnings.
   IBM was up &lsqb; to 116}, after launching a home computer to sell
for $999 in mainstream retail stores.
   Among other actively traded stocks, Philip Morris was up \ to
46~; General Motors was down ~ to 46~; and American Express was
down &lsqb; to 30&rsqb;.
   UAL Corp. was down 5 to 147 in light trading, after falling 3&rsqb;
on Monday. There has been concern that employee unions trying to
buy the airline company will not obtain financing by an August
deadline.
   In over-the-counter trading, International Lease Finance Corp.
was up 3~ to 31. Late Monday, the aircraft leasing company said it
had agreed to a $1.3 billion buyout by American International Group
Inc., the nation's largest commercial and industrial insurance
underwriter.
   AIG was down 2| to 94 on the NYSE.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 169.55 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $4.202 billion, or 0.12
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.13 to 192.47.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .38 to 413.25, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index slipped .25 to 352.06.

declined .26 to 455.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 356.80, down .59.
