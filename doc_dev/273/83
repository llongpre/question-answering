   Stock prices rallied for the third consecutive day of the new year, posting modest gains as the pace of trading slowed. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 6.30 to close at 2037.80, its highest closing level since the Oct. 19 market crash. 
Volume eased substantially to 169.7 million shares from Tuesday's 209.5 million. 
Advancing stocks outpaced losing issues 948-670. 

   "It looks like we have a very nice market going for us," James C. Andrews, vice president, institutional trading, at Janney Montgomery &amp; Scott Inc., Philadelphia, said. 
Yesterday's slowing of the previous two days' advance, he said, "was just a little profit-taking, and that's healthy." 

   Peter VandenBerg, vice president, trading, at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., also expressed confidence. 
"We've had a super two-day run-up here where people are putting some money to work," he said. 
"After two days of basically being up 100 points, we're just consolidating things a bit." 

   Several broader market indexes also advanced yesterday. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.26 to 258.89, reaching a post-crash high for the second consecutive day. 
The New York Stock Exchange composite index also touched a high since the crash but pulled back to close at 144.82, up 0.28 but below its Oct. 21 level of 145.02. 

   "This market is very impressive, and it's resisting any attempted selloff," Trude Latimer, market strategist for Josephthal &amp; Co., New York, said. 
"It's not dependent for its strength on programs, futures, et cetera, as it was last year, because of the breadth of the market." 

   Ralph Acampora, vice president, technical research, at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., New York, said he wouldn't be surprised to see the market stall at its current level. 

   "Everybody looks at the stock market on a day-to-day basis, which is fine," he said. 
"But if you go back a few weeks, you're up more than 300 points on the Dow. 
Any kind of hesitation at this point is normal." 

   Traders and analysts said the dollar's movements will continue to lead the stock market in the near term. 
The dollar continued its recent gain yesterday, but the pace of its advance slowed as traders said the currency was finding a new trading range. 

   "The dollar has been the big stimulant here for the past few days, but it should probably slow down and slow the equity market for a while, which is fine," Mr. Acampora said. 

   Donald Crooks, an equity trader at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., New York, said he expects stocks to pull back in the next few weeks to the 1950 or 2000 level. 
After that, stocks should "meander higher," he said. 

   Mr. Acampora said he sees the industrial average rising to 2200 or 2300 in the first quarter or slightly afterward. 
But in the second half of the year, he said, the market is likely to pull back sharply in expectation of a recession in early 1989. 

   Drug stocks continued to draw investor interest in the wake of Hoffmann-LaRoche's acquisition offer for Sterling Drug. 
Despite weakness in the shares of Merck, an industry leader and Dow Jones industrials component, several drug issues posted sharp gains. 

   Becton Dickinson jumped 1 5/8 to 55 5/8 after Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Lucy Olwell raised her near-term rating on the stock to a "buy" from an "above average." 
Warner-Lambert, Pfizer, Squibb, Upjohn and Syntex all gained. 

   Josephthal's Ms. Latimer said she expects the group to continue performing well "with or without further takeover activity," saying, "their turn has come up again." 

   She said she particularly favors issues that are excluded from many of the indexes, such as Upjohn and Syntex, and haven't made moves as large as those in the indexes. 

   Mr. Crooks said Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. began recommending retailing stocks to clients after the retailing group was discussed at a morning meeting yesterday. 
Limited, Gap, Sears, K mart, Wal-Mart and Federated Department Stores all gained in yesterday's trading. 

   Ashland Oil shares continued to slide in the aftermath of the oil spill near Pittsburgh resulting from the collapse of an Ashland tank. 
The stock was down 1 7/8 at 54 5/8 on volume of about 1.2 million shares. 
Analysts said it was too early to assess the company's potential exposure to class-action suits over the spill, which is contaminating water supplies. 

   Other oil issues were mixed. 
Texaco added 3/4 to 37 7/8, Chevron rose 5/8 to 43, USX gained 5/8 to 32 5/8, Amoco advanced 3/4 to 72 3/4, and Unocal grew 3/8 to 32 3/8. 
But Mobil slipped 3/8 to 40 3/4, Pennzoil eased 1/4 to 73 3/4, Exxon lost 3/8 to 40 3/8, and Sun slid 3/8 to 52 1/8. 
Phillips Petroleum gained 1/4 to 14 1/4 after it said it expects to take a $10 million fourth-quarter charge from a settlement over crude-oil pricing. 

   International Business Machines continued to rally, gaining 1 to 122 7/8 on more than 1.5 million shares. 
Among other active issues, Union Carbide soared 1 5/8 to 24 3/8 on volume of more than 1.6 million shares, General Electric closed up a 1/4 to 47, and Navistar was unchanged at 4 3/8. 

   Gillette surged 2 1/8 to 33 1/2 in heavy trading. 
Wall Street sources said Coniston Partners accumulated a 3% to 4% stake in the maker of razor blades and consumer products. 
Coniston declined to comment. 

   Citicorp rose 1/4 to 20 5/8 after it confirmed that it plans to lay off 400 employees. 
Other bank stocks ended mostly higher. 
Manufacturers Hanover gained 3/4 to 22 3/8, Chemical Bank added 1/8 to 21 7/8, Mellon gained 1/8 to 27 7/8, and Chase Manhattan rose 1/8 to 22 3/4. 
J.P. Morgan declined 1 3/8 to 36 3/4.
