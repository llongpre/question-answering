   As summer draws to a close over Labor Day
weekend, many conversations at cookouts and cocktail parties likely
will turn to what the stock market's record-setting August means for
September and beyond.
   Unlike past years when trading often was becalmed in the summer
with investors taking holidays away from Wall Street, the past month
earned a place in the history books.
   Most notably, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finally
achieved what several other closely watched stock performance
measures already had accomplished, reaching an all-time high after
setting many post-crash highs.
   On Aug. 24, the Dow average made its first move into uncharted
territory since before the Oct. 19, 1987 crash, with a 56.53-point
surge to 2,734.64. It extended the advance the last week in the
month, reaching 2,743.36 on Aug. 28. The previous record of 2,722.42
had stood since Aug. 25, 1987.
   Broader indicators turned in comparable performances. The New
York Stock Exchange's composite index of all listed common stocks
repeatedly hit new highs in August as did Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock composite index.
   Stock buyers were motivated partly by hopes of profiting from
acquisitions or takeover attempts. Much of the thrust behind the
market's move came from airlines, for instance.
   UAL Corp. soared when news surfaced that Los Angeles investor
Marvin Davis was seeking the parent of United Airlines. The stock
continued to roar along on news United's pilots union, joined by
management and British Airways PLC, were formulating a bid for UAL,
leaving the ownership question up in the air.
   UAL, trading in the $170s early in the summer, flew up to around
$280 by the end of August and helped the Dow Jones average of 20
transportation issues zoom to previously unseen altitudes.
   The steep climb in the Dow Jones transportation average triggered
buying by market technicians who decided their charts were pointing
to future gains in stock prices.
   Mergers among pharmaceutical companies acting to increase
competitive clout by joining forces attracted speculators to drug
stocks. The latest deal was revealed in late July when Bristol-Myers
Co. said it would absorb Squibb Corp. in an $11 billion stock swap.
The announcement encouraged buying in the sector.
   The ability of stocks to scale new heights was noteworthy in that
it occurred without much support from the bond market.
   A bond rally fueled by expectations of easier credit ran out of
energy in August once the view started spreading around financial
markets that the economy might not need the stimulation of lower
interest rates.
   As activity wound down Friday ahead of the long weekend, the Dow
Jones industrial average continued its advance. At the close of
business, the average stood at a record 2,752.09, up 14.82 points
from the previous session and 19.73 higher than a week before.
   Weekly readings for other market measures showed the New York
Stock Exchange composite index up 1.58 at a record 196.37; the
NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market up 4.59 at
471.34; and the American Stock Exchange market value index up 2.78
at 383.96..
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 151.49 million shares a day,
down from a daily average of 165.96 the week before.
   What lies ahead for the stock market depends partly on how
investors read the economic tea leaves. Government reports issued
Friday suggested the economy has adequate pep to sustain a moderate
expansion and the threat of a recession _something economists were
worried about earlier this summer _ is very remote.
   Regardless of what the economy does, though, forecasters seem to
agree that the stock market is due for a period of consolidation.
   ``It was really a pretty spectacular month,'' said Hugh Johnson,
economist at First Albany Corp. ``I don't look for anything near the
August gains in September. Common sense says we have to have a
breather.''
