   Stock prices fell Friday but still displayed
signs of resilience after the Labor Department issued an employment
report that deepened investor concerns about inflation.
   ``The market absorbed the negative news fairly well _ I didn't
see a selling rout by any means,'' said Ralph Acampora, a market
analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 9.60 to 2,092.28
after having been down about 17 points in early trading. The index
closed out the week with a 17.60-point gain.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
822 issues down, 616 up and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to a sluggish 124.61 million
shares, down from 129.38 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 150.79 million shares.
   The Labor Department's monthly report on employment had been
eagerly awaited by financial markets for indications on the
direction of the economy.
   But the news that 463,000 new jobs were created last month came
as a blow to traders because it meant the economy remained strong.
The markets believed the higher-than-expected gain in jobs would
prompt the Federal Reserve Board to raise its discount rate to keep
a lid on inflation.
   Bond prices slumped on the news, with the Treasury's 30-year
issue skidding about $15 per $1,000 in face amount by late
afternoon. Meanwhile, the bond's yield surged to about 9.16 percent
from late Thursday's 9.02 percent, and short-term interest rates
also moved higher.
   Wall Street took its cue from the credit markets, opening lower
and continuting to slide. But as the afternoon wore on, blue chip
issues recovered some lost ground.
   ``Most market participants were suprised that the market was not
hit harder,'' said Alfred Goldman, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Acampora, the Kidder Peabody analyst, said, ``A lot of the
negative news was already discounted in the market.''
   Goldman said Wall Street faces a critical test in coming sessions
because of competition from the increasingly attractive yields of
short-term debt and money-market instruments.
   ``One-year T (Treasury) bills offer extremely stiff competition
for the stock market,'' Goldman said. Yields on one-year bills
reached 8.94 percent by late Friday.
   If the Dow Jones industrial average falls through the 2,030 mark
and other market indicators drop below important psychological
levels, ``Christmas and the first of the new year will bring little
cheer, and there will be trouble well into the first quarter'' for
Wall Street, Goldman said.
   However, if stocks ``hold at these levels, it will signal that
there are enough buyers around who feel that stocks are
attractive,'' he said.
   The most-actively traded issue on the NYSE was RJR Nabisco, which
fell 1 to 90}.
   Technology issues were among the gainers. IBM rose 1 to 119\,
Digital Equipment was up 1] to 95\ and Compaq Computer picked up 1[
to close at 57[.
   Among the decliners were AT&amp;T, down | to 28}, Dow Chemical, which
dropped 1\ to 84[, and General Motors, off ~ to 83|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $3.696 billion, or 0.14
percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.35 to 153.02.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.62 to 313.16, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.68 to 271.81.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.04 to 373.91.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.02
to 295.27.
