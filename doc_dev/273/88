   The stock market struggled to a small gain
Thursday, following through on Wednesday's advance after some early
hesitation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 16.32 on Wednesday,
gained another 4.17 to 2,661.61. That pushed the average past its
previous post-crash closing high of 2,660.66, reached on Monday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
874 up, 628 down and 499 unchanged.
   Although the Dow Jones industrial average remains more than 60
points below its 1987 high, the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market became the latest of several broader market
measures to hit a record level.
   It rose 2.85 to 456.93, surpassing its reading of 455.26 on Aug.
26, 1987.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the index of
leading economic indicators dipped 0.1 percent in June, following a
downward-revised drop of 1.3 percent the month before.
   Analysts had been forecasting a decline of 0.2 percent to 0.3
percent for June. They said the actual figure had little apparent
impact on the market, leaving significant questions unanswered
about the economic outlook.
   The debate continues among market analysts over whether slowing
growth will lead to a relatively benign ``soft landing'' or
something with more severe effects on the pace of business and
corporate profits.
   Analysts said some stronger sentiment might arise Friday after
the Labor Department issues its monthly report on the employment
situation.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 168.69 million
shares, down from 181.76 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 210.44 million shares.
   Walt Disney jumped 6] to 121 in active trading. The company said

Orlando, Fla. The stock has also been buoyed lately by takeover
speculation.

rose 1 to 113}; American Express { to 38\; General Motors 1] to 46,
and Philip Morris 1[ to 163|.
   Ashland Oil rose 1[ to 38|; Nicor gained 1{ to 39}, and Oracle
Systems, traded in the over-the-counter market, was up 1 at 16].
   The three were added to Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite
index, prompting buying by index funds set up to duplicate the
performance of that measure of market trends.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .60 to 393.62, and the
500-stock composite was up .40 at 344.74.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $8.52 billion, or 0.25
percent, in value.
