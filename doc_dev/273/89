   Stock prices rode a roller coaster through a busy session of profit-taking, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average struggling to a record 13th consecutive gain. 
But most other market measures finished lower. 

   The industrial average shot up about 15 points in the first few minutes of trading, but gave up all of its early gains after International Business Machines reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. 
However, some late buying of blue-chip issues put the average in the plus column for the day, with a gain at the close of 1.97 to 2104.47. 

   The gain marked the first 13-session winning streak for the measure since Oct. 1, 1928, when the Dow Jones industrials were formulated as a 30-stock average. 
It topped the previous record 12-session streak, established with a 64.42-point rise Nov. 18 through Dec. 7, 1970. 
Through yesterday, the industrial average's gain has included 12 consecutive record closes and totaled 208.52 points. 

   Among the broader market barometers finishing lower, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.30 to 269.04, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index eased 0.09 to 153.62. 

   Yet Big Board advancers had a slim lead over decliners, 849 to 811. 
Traders were kept busy, as 224.8 million changed hands on the Big Board, up from 162.8 million shares Monday. 
Yesterday's trading was the seventh heaviest ever. 

   Smaller capitalization stocks were a mixed bag. 
The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index gained 0.51 to a record 294.48. 
But in the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 0.53 to 392.06. 

   Traders said stock prices were held back for a variety of reasons. 
After a gain of 11% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, some investors couldn't resist the temptation to take some profits. 

   "Some clients are saying 'enough is enough' and looking for short-sale ideas," said one trader at a New York-based brokerage firm. 
In a short sale, investors sell borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. 
In the past few sessions, that has turned out to be a painful strategy as short sellers faced losses from buying back shares at higher prices. 

   Traders said that while foreign interest in U.S. stocks remains strong, they are seeing a fair number of foreign sellers as well as buyers. 

   Analysts said they see a few indications that the current rally is running out of steam. 
For instance, last Thursday, 217 Big Board stocks made new highs, but the number hasn't begun to approach that level since then. 
Friday only 107 issues reached new highs, just 110 Monday and 158 yesterday. 

   These numbers "suggest many stocks made their peaks last Thursday and have yet to surpass them even though the indexes continued to set new records," said Newton Zinder, a technical analyst with E.F. Hutton in New York. 
Michael O'Higgins, an Albany, N.Y.-based money manager, believes such numbers "may be signaling that this (rally) is due for a rest, at the very least." 

   IBM fell 2 1/2 to 122 3/4 on trading of more than 3.2 million shares. 
The company said fourth-quarter net income fell to $2.28 a share from $4.36 a year earlier, with results slightly below most analysts' expectations. 
Before the results were released, the stock traded as high as 127 1/4. 

   After reporting the 48% fourth-quarter earnings decline, IBM Chairman John F. Akers said that the company will find it difficult to match last year's first-quarter results. 

   Steven Milunovich, a computer analyst with First Boston, said he expects IBM to earn $1 a share in the first quarter, compared with $1.65 a share a year earlier. 
He said he believes the company is plagued by the weak demand that has hindered other computer makers and that many of its products are losing market share. 
IBM "can't produce enough revenue growth to support its cost structure. 
They've just expanded too quickly," he said. 

   Other technology stocks were mostly lower, as profit-takers zeroed in on this highflying group. 

   In the OTC market, Apple Computer ended down 1 1/2 to 51 5/8 on heavy volume after trading as high as 55 3/4. 
The company's fiscal first-quarter per-share net was unchanged at 91 cents because of an increase in the number of shares outstandings, but profit rose to $58.5 million from $56.9 million. 

   Salomon tumbled 5 1/8 to 39 1/4 on more than 7.7 million shares, making it the most-active Big Board stock. 
Wall Street professionals were surprised by the company's announcement late Monday that it expects to report a 40% drop in fourth-quarter earnings, partly because of expansion costs at its principal unit, Salomon Brothers. 

   Brenda McCoy, who follows domestic brokerage firms at PaineWebber, said nearly every analyst on Wall Street was looking for significantly higher earnings for Salomon. 
She said she doesn't consider the stock an attractive buy right now. 

   However, Nancy Young at Tucker Anthony thinks the stock is a buy right now because she believes future deregulation will give the firm a big opportunity for expansion. 
She adds that Salomon is earning an attractive 15% on equity and that the stock is trading at the lower end of her expected 38-to-65 trading range for the year. 
Other brokerage stocks were lower. 

   Circle K plummeted 2 7/8 to 14 on extremely heavy volume of more than 2.9 million shares. 
Fewer than 200,000 shares usually trade daily. 
A company spokesman attributed the price drop to the fact that Rausher Pierce Refsnes lowered its recommendation to a sell from a hold on the stock and lowered its fiscal 1987 earnings estimate for the company. 

   There had been market rumors that Carl Lindner, who controls 31% of Circle K stock, was a seller, but the company spokesman said there wasn't any "truth at all to the rumor." 

   Home Shopping Network, which split 2-for-1 effective yesterday, shot up 5 3/4 to 38 1/4 on more than one million shares before Home Shopping trading on the Amex was halted late in the day. 
There was renewed speculation that Home Shopping was interested in buying a competitor, but Wall Street professionals believe that short sellers are still scrambling to cover their positions as the price of the stock continues to climb. 
After the market closed, Home Shopping said it was holding preliminary merger talks with C.O.M.B., which rose 4 1/2 to 28 1/4 in OTC trading. 

   Federal National Mortgage Association eased 1/8 to 40 5/8. 
The company reported fourth-quarter earnings rose to 69 cents a share from 28 cents a year earlier. 
David Penn at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore said the stock has been one of the star performers lately in the interest-rate sensitive group, and the gain in earnings was anticipated on Wall Street. 

   Polaroid jumped 3 1/2 to 75 1/2. 
Morgan Stanley's Brenda Lee Landry reiterated her buy recommendation because she expects sales to increase 12% to 15% this year, up from an earlier estimate of a 10% increase. 

   Great Northern Nekoosa moved up 2 1/4 to 79 3/4. 
In an interview with Dow Jones News Service, the company said fourthquarter profit rose 250% on an 11% gain in sales. 
William R. Laidig, chairman, said fourth-quarter profit was about $1.38 a share, compared with 40 cents a year earlier. 
Other paper stocks were strong.
