   A report that Iraq may be ready to withdraw from
Kuwait peacefully triggered a powerful rally in the stock market on
Tuesday, lifting key market indicators to their third consecutive
advance.
   The news that suggested the Persian Gulf crisis could be
resolved without an armed conflict between Iraq and the
multinational military force led by the United States ignited a
market that sank gradually for much of the afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was down more
than 25 pouints with a half hour left in the session, finished with
a gain of 14.11 points to close at 2,579.70.
   That represented a turnaround of about 40 points in only 30
minutes.
   ``This is a news headline type of market,'' said Larry Wachtel,
a market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. He said the
report ``turned market psychology around'' even without official
confirmation.
   But he warned that if the report proves inaccurate, the market
could reverse course just as quickly.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
907 up, 639 down and 457 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 185.82 million
shares, up from 177.07 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 227.06 million shares.
   News of a British satellite television report that Iraq would be
willing to withdraw from Kuwait in as long as it was not attacked
and could keep the disputed Rumailah oil field triggered the rally
at about 3:30 p.m. EST.
   Wachtel said the report triggered buying in the futures markets,
which in turn set off a scramble to buy the stocks on which stock
index futures contracts are based.
   But Wachtel and several other analysts said that the stock
market faces some tough going, given the depressed state of the
economy and the damaging effect that that may have on corporate
profits.
   ``The market is getting a little tired,'' Dennis Jarrett, chief
market analyst at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said before the late
turnaround.
   He said the market's early decline reflected profit-taking in
the wake of last week's 32 point-plus advance in the Dow Jones
industial average.
   That advance had included gains of 40.84 points in the Dow
industrials on Friday and another 5.94 point rise on Monday.
   Bank stocks got a lift Tuesday from the Federal Reserve's
announcement that it was reducing reserve requirements in an effort
to encourage more bank lending.
   First Chicago Corp. was the most active issue on the NYSE,
rising 1 to 18}.
   Citicorp gained 1{ to 14&rsqb;, Chase Manhattan rose { to 11{,
BankAmerica climbed 1{ to 24{ and First Bank System rose ~ to 13}.
   NCR rose 2 to 83{. On Sunday, AT&amp;T said it was offering to buy
NCR for $90 a share, but NCR has indicated it wants to remain
independent. AT&amp;T rose \ to 30&rsqb;.
   Continental Airlines led the Amex's most-active list, dropping \
to 1}. The debt-laden carrier filed for bankruptcy court protection
on Monday.
   In the over-the-counter market the most active issue was MCI,
down { to 18} with more than 4.6 million shares traded.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $20.71 billion, or 0.68
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.12 to 178.19.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.88 to 381.93, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index climbed 2.25 to 326.35.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.78 to 364.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 302.64, up 0.04.
