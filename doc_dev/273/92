   The stock market retreated in sluggish trading
Thursday, as concerns about rising interest rates resurfaced on the
first anniversary of the all-time peak in the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   ``People's attitudes are not as positive as they were a year
ago,'' said Jack Garry, manager of institutional trading at the
brokerage Butcher &amp; Singer Inc. in Philadelphia.
   A round of interest rate increases overseas and a new U.S.
economic report that contained an upward revision in one measure of
inflation for the second quarter were cited by analysts as reason
for the price slide.
   They said the combination stirred worries that U.S. interest
rates could be headed higher, making returns on Treasury securities
more competitive with those expected from stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34 on
Wednesday, lost 15.82 to close at 2,010.85. One year ago, the
market's best-known barometer had closed at 2,722.42, its record
high.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
453 issues up, 998 down and 501 unchanged. The NYSE index fell 0.99
to 146.94.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.64 million shares,
compared with 127.80 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
148.23 million shares.
   The market opened lower and the Dow Jones industrial average
extended its decline through midafternoon. The blue-chip index was
off 26.31 points at 2 p.m. before recovering some lost ground in
the last two hours of the session.
   Before the U.S. stock market opened, the West German central
bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other European
countries followed suit.
   Also in advance of the opening, the Commerce Department revised
upward its estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 3.3
percent from 3.1 percent, and simultaneously boosted its estimate
of an inflation measure tied to the gross national product to show
a rise of 5.1 percent, up from 4.1 percent.
   Analysts said the combination of European rate hikes and the
revised inflation estimate stirred speculation that U.S. rates
could be headed higher. Investors expect that if the economy
continues to expand rapidly and inflation rises, the Federal
Reserve may encourage higher interest rates.
   Prices in the U.S. bond market slipped Thursday, nudging rates
up.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, lost about $5 for every
$1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 9.45 percent from
9.40 percent Wednesday.
   Lawrence R. Helfand, manager of retail sales at Rodman &amp; Renshaw
Inc. in Chicago, said the rising rates were offering ``some stiff
competition for the stock market.''
   He noted that yields on one-year Treasury bills are above 8.2
percent, and are proving attractive for investors looking for a
haven for their money in a volatile financial climate.
   ``We won't make much headway until there is a sign that higher
interest rates have begun to slow the economy,'' he said.
   Butcher &amp; Singer's Garry said he expects trading to remain
sluggish until after the Labor Day holiday. ``We are in a drifting
pattern,'' he said.
   Northeast Utilities was the most active issue on the NYSE with
more than 12.1 million shares traded. It fell \ to 18}. Friday is
the deadline to qualify for the company's quarterly dividend.
   Insilco rose 1[ to 31[. The company's board approved a
$31.75-a-share buyout offer from two Texas oilmen.
   Among active blue-chip issues, International Business Machines
fell 1[ to 111|, Exxon slipped \ to 45}, American Express fell | to
28[ and General Electric edged up [ to 40[.
   In over-the-counter trading, Farmers Group rose } to 70. The
company agreed to a $75-a-share takeover offer from B.A.T.
Industries of Britain, but some obstacles remain to completing the
deal.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, fell $16.52 billion, or 0.63 percent.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.14 to 297.36, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was off 1.95 to 259.18.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.85
to 293.21. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market fell 1.99 to 374.04.
