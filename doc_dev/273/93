   Over-the-counter stocks climbed for the fifth consecutive session yesterday in the second-heaviest Nasdaq trading of 1988. 

   However, OTC stocks are losing ground in their bid to be the first sector of the market to climb back to pre-crash price levels. 

   The Nasdaq composite index, which has been at a post-crash high since last week, yesterday gained 1.72 to 388.53. 
OTC stocks didn't rise as much as the blue chips yesterday that were hitting their post-crash high: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%, twice as much as the comparable Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC industrials, which added 2.08 to 371.55. 

   Until recently the Nasdaq composite had recovered the most ground from pre-crash levels of all U.S. stock indexes. 
With yesterday's advance, the composite has climbed to within 4.4% of its level on Oct. 16, 1987, the trading day before Black Monday. 

   In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, even with its surge yesterday, is still 6% below that pre-crash level, and the American Stock Exchange composite is 4.5% below pre-crash. 
But other indexes have caught up to the Nasdaq's recovery, including the S&amp;P-500 index, which is 3% below pre-crash, and the New York Stock Exchange composite, which is 2.9% below. 

   Although many of the OTC market's big computer and biotechnology stocks fell yesterday, overall winning issues outpaced decliners 1,170 to 874 on Nasdaq volume of 174.8 million shares -- second only this year to 189 million shares on March 18. 

   Traders are cheered by institutional interest in OTC stocks in recent days. 

   Victor Wright, a general partner in charge of OTC trading at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York, said, "OTC stocks have led the market for the past week. 
And I think that's continuing. 
I see a continual broadening of institutional interest, technology stocks in particular." 

   Tony Cecin, chief OTC trader at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis, added, "As the market keeps going up and up the portfolio types get more and more nervous about having high cash levels." 

   Among active stocks yesterday, Micropolis fell 2 1/2 to 18 1/2 on 2.4 million shares, the third-highest on Nasdaq. 
The Chatsworth, Calif., computer disk-drive maker said its second-quarter net income wouldn't match last year's 60 cents a share. 
Other disk-drive stocks also fell. 
Seagate Technology lost 1 3/8 to 16 5/8; Miniscribe lost 1/2 to 10 7/8; and Conner Peripherals fell 3/8 to 9. 

   Among biotechnology issues, LyphoMed lost 1/2 to 11 5/8; Cetus slipped 1/4 to 12 3/4; and Immunomedics lost 1/8 to 7 5/8. 

   Interleaf dropped 1 3/8 to 14 3/8. 
Montgomery Securities lowered its investment rating on the stock and reduced its earnings estimate for the company's first quarter, ending in June, to seven cents a share from 10 cents a share, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said. 

   L.A. Gear rose 1 3/8 to 28 7/8. 
The athletic-footwear maker estimated sales for the second quarter ended May 31 more than tripled. 

   Pentair added 1 1/4 to 31 3/4. 
The St. Paul, Minn., paper, tools and machinery maker predicted earnings of more than $1.50 a share for the first six months of 1988, compared with 61 cents a share a year earlier. 

   The biggest loser among the most actives was Coated Sales, falling 1/2 to 1, a 33% tumble, on nearly two million shares. 
Two months ago the stock was at nearly 10. 
The Laurence Harbor, N.J., fabric maker said an assets discrepancy it is investigating would exceed the $6 million previously reported.
