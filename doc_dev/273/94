   The National Association of Securities Dealers publishes eight indexes daily to help investors evaluate the over-the-counter market. 
But investors probably should know something about how those indexes are put together. 

   Nasdaq's 3,008-stock Composite Index, for instance, tells precious little about the overwhelming majority of over-the-counter issues. 
And its bank and utility stock indexes don't measure what most OTC bank and utilities stock prices do. 
The reasons include historical accident, the way the indexes are calculated and the nature of the OTC market itself. 

   Gene L. Finn, the NASD's chief economist, concedes that the indexes have quirks. 
He says the NASD is considering starting new indexes to supplement the existing measures. 

   In the first quarter, the Nasdaq Composite Index outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and other measures of the broad market in exchange listed stocks. 
This doesn't mean, however, that the small stocks that make up more than a third of the Nasdaq listings outperformed the broader market. 
Indeed, study of all 4,300 Nasdaq stocks shows that small issues actually underperformed big stocks as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500-stock index, as well as larger Nasdaq stocks. 

   Nasdaq indexes, like the New York Stock Exchange Composite and other exchange indexes, are weighted by market capital -- a stock's price times the number of shares outstanding. 
This method gives more significance to widely held issues. 

   Such weighting, however, skews the OTC indexes more than the other measures. 
Only 14 issues on the New York Stock Exchange have market capital of less than $10 million. 
But more than 1,500, or nearly 35% of Nasdaq stocks, fall short of that mark, and together they carry less weight in the Nasdaq Composite Index than just the six biggest issues combined. 

   NASD officials say they are considering a new, unweighted index based on a simple price average of all Nasdaq stocks. 

   It also pays for investors to know the quirks of the narrower Nasdaq indexes. 
Its bank index, for example, doesn't include most of the 804 Nasdaq banking stocks -- or any of the biggest ones. 
Yet all 225 savings-bank stocks are included. 

   Those stocks did well in the first quarter, and the Nasdaq Bank Index rose 22.7%. 
But big Nasdaq commercial bank stocks lagged. 
A weighted index of these 386 issues, based on NASD figures, rose 13.6% in the quarter. 

   NASD officials say that when the index was started in 1971, all commercial and savings banks had the same code number under the Standard Industrial Classification -- a government statistical tool used by, among other agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The NASD, faced with the huge and constantly changing OTC market, opted to use the codes as a basis for its sector indexes. 

   Since 1971, however, most commercial banks have restructured as holding companies, with new codes that have moved them out of the bank index group. 
An investor wanting to track commercial bank stock performance now would do better with Nasdaq's Other Finance category, dominated by big banks and thrifts. 
The category rose 14.6% in the first quarter. 

   Then there are utility stocks. 
The Nasdaq Utility Index jumped 18% in the first quarter, while indexes of listed utility stocks rose barely 3%. 
But in fact, most of the 55 electric, gas and water utility stocks on Nasdaq performed much like their counterparts on the major exchanges. 

   The Nasdaq Utility Index's performance is determined not by utility companies, but largely by broadcasting companies, communications companies and cable-television companies. 

   That's because telephone firms, widely considered utilities when the index was set up 16 years ago, carried the communications code. 
Putting that code in the utility index meant including broadcasters -- a relatively minor consideration at the time. 

   Nowadays, though, cable-TV and broadcasting stocks make up one of the fastest-growing OTC stock groups. 
Hence, the Nasdaq Utility Index is a good measure of broadcast and communications stocks, but is almost useless for utility shares.
