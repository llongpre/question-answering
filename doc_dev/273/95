   Stock prices surged Wednesday, bouncing back
from levels last seen nearly three months ago in a rally that
gathered momentum toward the finish. Trading volume, however,
remained sluggish.
   Analysts said the market had been due for a rebound after this
month's steady decline. But they said some encouraging news on the
trade deficit and some bargain-hunting also contributed to the
rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on
Tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions,
climbed 37.34 points to close at 2,026.67, its biggest gain in
nearly a month. Tuesday's close had left the market's best-known
indicator at its lowest level since late May.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5-to-2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,089 issues up, 376 down and 498 unchanged. The NYSE index rose
1.99 to 147.93.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.80 million shares,
up from 119.54 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
151.27 million shares.
   Prices rose smartly for the first hour of trading, pulled back
somewhat at midday and then extended their gains during the early
afternoon. A 12-point spurt in the final hour of trading lifted the
Dow Jones industrial average to its biggest gain since a 46.40 rise
on July 29.
   Jack Solomon, an analyst for Bear Stearns &amp; Co., said a
combination of factors helped lift prices.
   He said this month's decline had soured the market's mood, and
Wednesday's activity reflected ``a release from excessively
consistent selling pressure.''
   He said some investors may have found soem bargains at their
depressed levels, while professional traders who had previously
sold borrowed stocks, expecting prices to fall, decided to buy
stocks.
   Solomon said the stock rally may have also reflected a delayed
reaction to Tuesday's government reports that consumer prices were
up modestly in July while orders for durable goods tumbled.
   He said a new government report that the nation's trade deficit
narrowed in the second quarter to $29.9 billion from an imbalance
of $35.2 billion in the first three months of the year may also
have provided some encouragement.
   All three reports were seen as reducing pressure on the Federal
Reserve to push interest rates higher, he said.
   ``If we get some good political or economic news, this rally may
continue. We may have broken the backbone of the decline,'' Solomon
said.
   But other analysts noted the gains came in continued slow
trading, and were skeptical about prospects for further gains.
   ``This seems to be feeding on itself a little bit,'' said Bill
Raftery, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``I don't
think it means a turning point in the market.''
   Wickes was the most actively-traded stock on the NYSE, slipping
[ to 13. Its management has proposed a leveraged buyout at $12 a
share.
   International Business Machines was the second most active
issue, climbing 1~ to 112}. Other point-plus gainers included
Boeing, up 2[ to 58}; Dow Chemical, up 1} to 83, and Philip Morris,
up 2\ to 91}.
   The automobile stocks rose despite reporting lower sales in
mid-August compared with a year earlier. Ford Motor rose 1| to 49,
General Motors rose } to 73 and Chrysler was up ] at 22].
   Some airline issues were strong gainers. UAL, parent of United
Airlines, jumped 2] to 90[, while AMR Corp. rose 1] to 43\, Delta
Airlines was up } to 46} and NWA Inc. rose } to 43].
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, rose $32.37 billion, or 1.26 percent, to
$2.606 trillion.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.91 to 299.50, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 4.04 at 261.13.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.06
to 294.06. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
