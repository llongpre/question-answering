   Over-the-counter stocks fell yesterday for the fifth consecutive session, unable to catch up with a late price surge on the New York Stock Exchange. 

   The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC industrial issues lost ground -- falling 1.22 to 348.64, a 0.35% decline -- while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32%. 

   However, over the past five days, the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq 100 have lost about the same amount, nearly 3%. 

   OTC stocks also have been buoyed recently by institutional interest, if not interest from individual investors, in seeking out smaller stocks at bargain prices. 
Avner Arbel, a professor of finance at Cornell University, said in a recent study that although stocks of large and more established companies haven't performed well in 1988, stocks of many smaller companies have wiped out losses from the Oct. 19 stock crash. 

   The Dow industrials and Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index are still below precrash levels, noted Mr. Arbel and his colleague, Steven Carvell. 
But the average price of all traded stocks by the end of the first quarter was 2% higher than before the crash. 

   Moreover, they said, the Nasdaq composite index was off only 7.8% at the end of the first quarter from Oct. 16, 1987. 
That's less of a drop than the Dow (down 11.51%), the S&amp;P (8.4%), the New York Stock Exchange composite (7.9%) or the American Stock Exchange composite (8.4%). 

   Cadbury Schweppes, traded on Nasdaq in the form of American depositary receipts, rose 3 to 62 3/4. 
British regulators approved General Cinema's current 18.2% stake in the company. 
Cadbury, a big U.K. candy and soft-drink maker, watched its stock soar in late April after General Cinema set its sights on it. 
But the Cadbury rally tapered off last week after regulators said they would study the anti-takeover ramifications of another move on a U.K. company, British Petroleum. 

   Some traders said the approval given General Cinema convinced them that bearishness about the BP development was overdone. 
However, the regulators noted that the General Cinema approval refers only to the current 18.2% stake. 

   Chiron rose 1 3/4 to 16 1/2 on about 725,000 shares, nearly 11 times its average. 
The Emeryville, Calif., drug company announced it has cloned the non-A, non-B hepatitis virus and later this year will seek Food and Drug Administration approval to try to come up with a diagnostic test for the virus. 

   Greenery Rehabilitation Group's first quarterly earnings decline since it went public in December 1985 ignited trading in its stock -- to the company's chagrin. 
Greenery fell 1 1/4 to 8 1/2 on nearly 15 times its average volume of 17,475. 
The Cambridge, Mass., operator of nine nationwide facilities for brain-injured patients reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, compared with 15 cents a year earlier. 
Greenery's president, Gerard M. Martin, blamed the slippage on escalating nurses' wages and hinted that there will be some cost containment. 

   The takeover maneuvering involving St. Louis banks continued. 
Mercantile Bancorp. rose 1 1/2 to 25 as traders speculated about the possibilities for a takeover. 
Mercantile itself has agreed to merge with neighbor Centerre Bancorp., but Centerre last week also received a competing bid from another neighbor, Boatmen's Bancshares. 
Centerre rose 1/2 to 44 1/4 and Boatmen's was unchanged at 32. 

   The Nasdaq composite index yesterday lost 0.84, to 375.43, a 0.22% decline. 
Trading remained light; 115.3 million shares changed hands, compared with the daily average this year of more than 125 million.
