   The stock market spun into a late rally Tuesday
after seesawing in a directionless session marked by low volume and
investor caution.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 16.91 points to
1,997.51.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 911 up, 585 down and 467 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 135.29 million shares, against 182.24
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
1.12 to 146.29.
   The Dow average dipped into negative territory at midday as
traders moved to cash in on an early technical rally that pushed
the key index up about 20 points in the first few hours of activity.
   But analysts were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about the
market's overall tone because trading volume remained among the
lightest levels so far this year.
   ``The overriding issue is that the volume is not particularly
convincing, and that's leaving the market fairly directionless,''
said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp.
   Despite a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices, there was
``a lack of strong fundamentals to sustain a move in either
direction,'' he added.
   Analysts said professional traders were the main players in the
market, with individual and institutional investors remaining on
the sidelines while they await clearer signals on state of the
overall economy.
   Traders are more interested in capitalizing on short-term
movements, while investors typically take a longer-term view of the
market, noted Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``This is one of those low-conviction markets where traders
dominate the arena,'' he said.
   Much of the session's activity centered on F.W. Woolworth, a
component of the Dow average and the most active issue of the day.
Woolworth finished up 2{ at 56| after jumping 8~ on Monday, when
Dart Group said it was interested in acquiring a stake in the
retailer.
   Woolworth had been up as much as 4 during the session, but fell
back amid profit-taking. Analysts said the stock's movements had a
fairly significant impact on the Dow throughout the day.
   Among other actively traded issues, International Business
Machines was unchanged at 107{; General Electric was up { to 40|,
and Pillsbury rose } to 44{.
   Koppers, the target of a takeover bid from Beazer, fell 1 to 56\.
   Airline issues were mixed amid analysts' speculation that
carriers would move to match lower discount fares announced by
Texas Air's Eastern and Continental units. AMR Corp. fell 1[ to
42[; Delta fell } to 51; Allegis rose ] to 82~ and Pan Am rose [ to
2~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $19.67 billion, or 0.77
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 158.46 million shares.
   Standard &amp; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 3.02 to 300.17,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.42 to 258.51.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose .06
to 295.07. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 373.41, up 1.52.
