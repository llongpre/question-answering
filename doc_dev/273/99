<TEXT>     The strength in blue chips and the broader market was echoed by the Russell
2000 index of small stocks, closing at a 1991 high of 180.59.;   Gains in the
financial and transportation areas were behind part of the day's strength,
with strong earnings by some banks and renewed optimism for easing interest
rates lifting most bank stocks.;   Solid earnings reports also helped
brokerage stocks. But it was IBM that pulled down the Dow early on lower
earnings, then led the march back in the afternoon. IBM reported sharply lower
earnings, but its stock gained 3, to 104 1/4, after the company signaled the
worst may be over.;   Volume on the Big Board was heavy at 214 million, up
from 130.1 million in light holiday trading Monday. Gainers outpaced losing
issues by a ratio of nearly 2 1/2 to 1.;   The New York Stock Exchange
composite rose 2.33 points to 214.90, while American Stock Exchange composite
rose 4.28 to 376.94. The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks, mostly blue
chips, rose 4.54 to 391.01.;   Bank stocks were up on earnings Tuesday, as
Wells Fargo rose 3 7/8 to 71 1/4, even though it reported lower-than-expected
earnings.; LOCAL STOCKS; ...; UP; ...; Company       Apple Computer; Amount up
