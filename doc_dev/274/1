<TEXT>     Florio said state Attorney General Robert Del Tufo believes there is no
reason to reopen what was then dubbed "the trial of the century." But he said
he would look at material sent to him.;   In her second public plea to Florio
in 16 months, Anna Hauptmann said she wants a chance to convince him that her
husband did not kidnap and murder 20-month-old Charles Lindbergh Jr. in 1932.;
  "My husband was never, never near the Lindbergh home," Hauptmann told a news
conference at the Union Hotel, where reporters and jurors stayed during the
trial. "They killed an innocent man.";   She said she was with her husband the
night of the kidnapping.;   "We didn't even know there was a kidnapping until
the next day," she said.;   Hauptmann went to the electric chair April 3,
1936, about four years after the boy was abducted from the Lindbergh home near
Hopewell. The child's body was discovered in a shallow grave near the home.
Hauptmann, a German immigrant, maintained his innocence to the end.;   "The
trial of the century was probably the greatest fraud in the history of this
country," said Robert Bryan, the San Francisco attorney who represents Anna
Hauptmann.;   Bryan said hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and lost
trial evidence prove that the trial was filled with misrepresentations and
fraud, that evidence was suppressed, that witnesses lied and that testimony
was changed.  </TEXT>
