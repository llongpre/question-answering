   An 11-year old who is trying to become the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot had to postpone his dream Sunday when a voltage regulator on his plane started acting up. 

   Christopher Lee Marshall, who wants to emulate Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight to Paris, arrived in Montreal from New York City Saturday aboard his Mooney 252 two-seater. 

   The young aviator from Oceana, Calif., was scheduled to fly to Greenland Sunday, then stop in Iceland before arriving in Paris on Wednesday. 
He began his trip Thursday in San Diego. 

   But Chris' co-pilot, Randy (Duke) Cunningham, flew the plane to Danbury, Conn., Sunday to have the voltage meter repaired. 
The two hoped to resume the flight yesterday. 

   Chris, who will be a fifth grader this fall, first took the controls of a plane at age four and began flying with an instructor at seven. 
He is the son of a commercial pilot. 
Last year, he became the youngest pilot to cross the U.S. 

   Mr. Cunningham, 46, a retired commander at Miramar Naval Air Station, Calif., and a Vietnam war pilot, sits in the pilot's seat. 
But he says Chris has done all the flying. 
He limits the boy's flying time to less than eight hours at a stretch. 

   Chris has said this trip will make him the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot. 
His next goal is to become the youngest pilot to fly around the world. 

   Mr. Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York City before completing his 33 1/2-hour, non-stop solo flight across the Atlantic to Paris in 1927.
