<LEADPARA>  While the trains aren't likely to role before the next century, a classic
political battle is building this spring over the planned route of BART to San
Jose. Two of the chief protagonists are rivals on the board of supervisors,
Ron Gonzales and Zoe Lofgren. And with a set of public hearings scheduled this
month, the stakes are suddenly much bigger than ever before. Some of the smart
money says BART will follow the Southern Pacific route favored by Lofgren.
That means the trains will run south along Interstate 880, stop near the
Mercury News, and then tunnel underneath Fifth, Eighth or Tenth streets into
downtown. A key stop on this line would be at Japantown, which is of
considerable interest to the well-heeled investors in the Nihonmachi
development.;    You may remember, however, that Gonzales is pushing a route
along the Union Pacific tracks, which parallel Lundy Avenue. three miles to
the east. Gonzales has argued that this would benefit many more east San
Joseans. Transportation planners now have completed a study showing that the
Gonzales alternative would cost $280 million more and produce only 640 more
daily riders. But Gonzales aide Jude Barry told us that those numbers -- based
on one more station than needed -- overstate the difference. ""We don't feel
the UP route is unrealistically more expensive," said Barry. FYI: The Southern
Pacific route would spare the home of Lofgren. The Gonzales alternative --
which now involves a deep tunnel -- would pass within a block of her house on
South 14th Street.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A VOTRE SAINTE;    With the departure of Mayor Tom McEnery and his Irish
roots, the new foreign passion at San Jose City Hall is Normandy. Our
columnist Leigh Weimers reported last Friday that a contingent of city
officials led by Vice Mayor Pat Sausedo will leave for Normandy on a junket in
March. And Normandy will be the theme of this year's Silicon Valley Charity
Ball, which will be attended by a host of French officials. Among those
pursuing this new relationship is the the city's director of economic
development, Bill Claggett, who will be on the March tour. What isn't so
widely known is that Claggett's wife, Sunny, has been a paid cultural
consultant for Normandy in Silicon Valley. Sunny Claggett told us she has been
a liaison with the Charity Ball and has helped to set up an exhibition of
French art. She contended, however, that she and her husband keep their
interests separate. "We're very much attentive to that," she said. "I'm only
doing the cultural stuff, helping them put together parties." A postscript: A
few prominent local business leaders have been grumbling that the city hasn't
emphasized exports enough in establishing relationships with countries that
want Silicon Valley jobs.; A WICKED STORY; Some of you may have followed Gov.
Pete Wilson's let-them-drink-cake statement last month. Defending his plan to
slash welfare payments, Wilson said: "I'm convinced they'll be able to pay the
rent. They will have less for a six-pack of beer. I don't begrudge them the
six-pack of beer, but it's not an urgent necessity." While this has generally
escaped scrutiny because of the Persian Gulf war, the timing of this
declaration was curious: It came only days after the Wilson administration
designated its own "official inauguration brew": Pete's Wicked Ale, made by
Pete's Brewing Co. in Palo Alto. Is the Wilson administration, uh, swilling
out of both sides of the mouth? Maybe not. Most welfare recipients won't be
able to afford Pete's. Its amber-colored Wicked Ale sells for $5.99 a
six-pack, a wickedly Republican price.; HISTORY LESSON; Everyone following the
war in the Middle East by now has an impression of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf,
the American commander known as "Stormin' Norman." What isn't so widely known
are some of the ironies in his family history. Schwarzkopf's father, also H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, was the commander of the New Jersey State Police and the
prime investigator in the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby in 1932. Charles
Lindbergh, you may remember, was one of America's major isolationists before
World War II (although what he would think about the Iraqi war is only a
guess).;    In any case, the details of the Lindbergh case make fascinating
reading today. When police found what they believed to be the body of the
Lindbergh baby in a patch of woods, Schwarzkopf pere was every bit as
meticulously prepared as his son today. He issued a formal brief to the press.
And he had emergency phone lines laid to within 75 feet of the site as he
pursued what he called a "gang" that did the kidnapping. In February, 1935, a
few months after Schwarzkopf's son was born, Bruno Richard Hauptmann was
convicted of the murder. (box)  </TEXT>
