   An 11-year-old California boy bidding
to fly the Atlantic in a single-engine plane arrived in this
western Scottish port city Wednesday night from Iceland.
   Christopher Lee Marshall said he plans to leave for Paris
Thursday morning to complete his journey and become the youngest
pilot to cross the Atlantic.
   The boy, from Oceano, Calif., started his flight in San Diego,
Calif., July 7. He said he hoped to reach Le Bourget airport
outside Paris at 11 a.m. (5 a.m. EDT). Le Bourget is where Charles
Lindbergh completed his historic solo crossing in 1927.
   Christopher and Randy Cunningham, a 46-year-old retired U.S.
Navy pilot who is accompanying the boy, don't regard the feat
accomplished until they reach Paris, following Lindbergh's
tradition. The two stayed overnight at a Glasgow hotel.
   Earlier Wednesday, Christopher landed his Mooney 252 aircraft at
Reykjavik, Iceland's capital, after flying about 450 miles from
Kulusuk on Greenland's southeast coast in 2 hours, 15 minutes.
   On arrival at Reykjavik, Christopher said the flight was
pleasant but he was frightened Tuesday over Greenland when he was
forced to return to Kulusuk because of problems with low oil
pressure and an overheated engine.
   He said he flew the plane all the time but needed Cunningham's
expert skills and knowledge to advise him on landing in Greenland.
   Asked why he was doing it, the boy said: ``I want to get kids
all over the world to accomplish their dreams.''
   Christopher has his teddy bear in the plane's back seat.
   ``He (the bear) doesn't like to sit in the back but I throw him
farther back if he starts complaining,'' he said.
   Cunningham limits Christopher's daily flying time to eight
hours. He stopped in St. Louis, New York and Montreal before flying
to Greenland.
   Last year Christopher became the youngest pilot to cross the
United States, a record that has since been broken by 9-year-old
Tony Aliengena.
