   An 11-year-old boy accompanied by a retired
Navy pilot ace today flew off on his quest to retrace Charles A.
Lindbergh's historic flight to Paris, a 7,000-mile journey.
   Christopher Lee Marshall of Oceano, Calif., and Randy
Cunningham, 46, departed from Montgomery Field at 8:32 a.m. today
on the first leg of their trip to Kerrville, Texas.
   The two, flying the first leg in a borrowed plane, will trade it
for a new Mooney 252 aircraft built for the trans-Atlantic journey.
Takeoff was originally scheduled for Monday, but was delayed by
storms in Texas.
   In 1927, Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, Mo., then
to New York City before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo
flight across the Atlantic Ocean to Paris.
   Because Cunningham is limiting the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a time, the trip will stretch out over five
days and include stops in Kernville; St. Louis, Mo.; New York;
Montreal; Sondestrom, Greenland, and Reykjavik, Iceland.
   According to Chris, the flight to Paris would make him the
world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot.
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said shortly before takeoff. ``I am an
ambassador to the youth of America, and I want to show all the
youth that if I can do my dreams, anyone can.''
   He said ``trying to stay awake'' would probably be the most
difficult part, ``but I will.''
   ``I'm not going to touch the controls unless there's an
emergency. Chris' aviation skills are phenomenal,'' Cunningham
said. The youngster has logged 200 hours, compared to Cunningham's
more than 7,000 miles.
   Chris, the son of a commercial air pilot, gained fame last
August when at age 10 he became the youngest aviator to fly across
the United States.
   In April, however, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., Tony Aliengena, broke the record by making a
California-Massachusetts round trip.
   Chris and his mother, Gail Marshall, who live about 15 miles
south of San Luis Obispo in central California, recruited
Cunningham for this trip after meeting him at an air show last year.
   Cunningham, a retired Miramar Naval Air Station, Calif.,
commander, was the only Navy pilot ace in the Vietnam War and is
the most-decorated Navy pilot, a Navy spokesman in San Diego said.
