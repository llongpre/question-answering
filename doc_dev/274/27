   Adela Rogers St. Johns, one of
journalism's avowed ``sob sisters'' who was a friend of former
President Nixon and newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, died
Wednesday. She was 94.
   Mrs. St. Johns, whose reporting career spanned nearly 60 years
and included such major stories as the Lindbergh kidnapping, had
been hospitalized at the South County Convalescent Hospital.
   An ardent feminist and a pioneer in her field, Mrs. St. Johns
once wrote: ``I wish women would stand together and shackle the men
who want to move us backwards.''
   Hearst hired her as a cub reporter at the San Francisco Examiner
for $7 a week in 1913, a time when there were few women in the
newsroom.
   The following year, she transferred to the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner, another Hearst newspaper, and later worked for the
International News Service. ``She was a kind of wild, uninhibited
woman before feminism came in,'' said Mel Durslag, a Los Angeles
Herald Examiner sports columnist and 50-year Hearst veteran. ``She
was a tough, hard newspaper woman, one of the guys. She was a
figure from the old roaring days of Hearst journalism, which no
longer lives.''
   She covered the ``trial of the century'' of Bruno Richard
Hauptmann, charged in the kidnapping and murder of aviator Charles
A. Lindbergh's infant son. When Britain's Edward VIII abdicated,
she was assigned the story. Later, she covered the assassination of
Louisiana political boss Huey Long and the trial of Patty Hearst,
the publisher's granddaughter.
   She was an avowed ``sob sister,'' saying at one time, ``Unless
you move the heart of the country, you will never get it moving.''
   In 1962, she published ``Final Verdict,'' about her father,
renowned criminal lawyer Earl Rogers, but perhaps her best-received
book was ``The Honeycomb,'' an autobiography published in 1969.
   In 1924, she married William Ivan ``Ike'' St. Johns, the
Herald's chief copy editor. They were divorced, and she remarried
twice, with both those marriages also ending in divorce. She had
three children from her marriages.
   Mrs. St. Johns was a longtime friend of former President Nixon,
who in 1970 honored her as the only woman among eight journalists
awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
   The award cited her for ``exceptional ability to reveal the
human story behind the news.''
