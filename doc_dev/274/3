   David T. Wilentz, who gained worldwide
attention in 1935 when he prosecuted Bruno Richard Hauptmann for
the kidnap and murder of the Lindbergh baby, has died at age 93.
   Wilentz, the father of state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert
N. Wilentz, died ``peacefully in his sleep'' Tuesday night at his
summer home in Long Branch, said Anne Riegle, a family spokeswoman.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean said Wilentz's death ``marks the passing of
a figure and personality of near legendary proportions.''
   His death came hours after a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia rejected the most recent effort of Hauptmann's widow,
Anna, to clear her husband's name.
   Born in Dwinsk, Latvia, on Dec. 21, 1894, Wilentz came to the
United States at age 6 and became a naturalized citizen in 1900.
   As a young state attorney general, he handled his first criminal
case when he prosecuted Hauptmann in what became known as ``the
trial of the century.''
   Hauptmann was convicted of kidnapping the 20-month-old son of
aviator Charles Lindbergh from his East Amwell estate and then
murdering the child. He was executed April 3, 1936, at Trenton
State Prison.
   The trial was followed worldwide and journalist H.L. Mencken
called it ``the biggest event since the Resurrection.'' Wilentz,
who personally opposed the death penalty, was noted during the
trial for his eloquence.
   Some students of the case and Mrs. Hauptmann continue to claim
Hauptmann was innocent and was railroaded during the trial.
   After a decade as attorney general, Wilentz, whose main home was
in Perth Amboy, served as chairman of the state Democratic
Committee.
   Although he considered running for governor, he later told
friends he decided that New Jersey at that time would not elect a
Jewish governor.
   Wilentz went on to found one of the most prominent and powerful
law firms in the state. He also was the former director of the
board of Amerada Hess Corp.
   Despite his advancing age, Wilentz continued to report for work
frequently at the family's Woodbridge law firm, and he had spent
some time working at the firm Tuesday.
   ``He was active from the time he was admitted to practice law in
1919 right to the present,'' Ms. Riegle said.
   She said funeral arrangements were pending.
   Wilentz is survived by his wife, Lena; sons Robert and Warren;
and his daughter Norma Hess.
