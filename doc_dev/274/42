   Gang violence and drug peddling at a
housing project behind a junior high school show no signs of going
away, so officials are trying to make the campus bulletproof by
building a 10-foot high wall.
   Faculty and administrators wore T-shirts Friday bearing ``The
Great Wall of Lindbergh'' logo to show their enthusiasm for the
$160,000 project at Lindbergh Junior High School. It is scheduled
for completion in six weeks.
   Judy Wade, a physical education teacher, has said she's seen
beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during
her 25 years at the school. ``Now, it's not what they're throwing,
but what they're shooting,'' she said.
   Students were evacuated from the recreation fields twice during
one week in April because of gunfire. Two years ago, a student
playing basketball after school was hit in the chest by a bullet
that whizzed through a chain-link fence.
   ``They've had trouble there for as long as I can remember,''
said Principal Max Fraley, referring to the problem housing project
that is adjacent to the schoolyard. ``It is a very large area where
a lot of drug dealers congregate.''
   The concrete block wall will extend 300 yards along the school's
playground, separating the school and 1,200 students from the
713-unit Carmelitos Housing Project, Fraley said.
   Funds for the wall came from the city school district and Los
Angeles County after teacher Joan Reedy was nearly hit recently by
bullets as she walked with students to a softball diamond.
   ``Shots came through the fence and we heard the whizzing by,''
Ms. Reedy said. ``I was OK at first, but when I got home I was
scared. So I went to the Board of Education and said, `Something
needs to be done.'''
   Plans call for the wall to be bordered by shrubs and decorated
with a large mural, Fraley said.
   ``We'll use anti-graffiti paint, something that it will be easy
to wash the gang graffiti off of,'' he said.
   The mural will include a painting of the Spirit of St. Louis,
the airplane aviator Charles Linbergh flew in 1927 in the first
solo trans-Atlantic flight, and a large ``L'' overlapped by a
picture of an eagle, the school mascot.
   The slogan ``Lindbergh Leads the Way'' will top the mural
painted in school colors of blue and red.
   ``A 900-foot wall of this sort is significant because it
recognizes the problems we face today, and it will make everyone on
school grounds feel a lot safer,'' Fraley said.
   The principal said the student who was hit two years ago while
playing basketball is now in high school and still has the bullet
in him.
   ``The doctors said it would do more harm to take it out, and I'm
told he hasn't suffered any ill effects from it after he recovered
from the gunshot itself,'' Fraley said.
   ``The wall is terrific,'' said student Joe Trejo, 13, who lives
in the Carmelitos project next door. ``Why? Because I don't want to
get shot.''
