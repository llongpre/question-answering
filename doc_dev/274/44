STUDY REJECTS BROWN FIELD AS NEW AIRPORT SITE;

Brown Field could not be used as a major international airport because the 
nearby San Ysidro Mountains would dictate much steeper takeoffs and landings 
than normal, a new Sandag study obtained Friday by The Times concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the city of San Diego, evaluated the possibility of 
building a commercial airport at Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Koerper, San Diego Assn. of Governments special projects director, who has 
been overseeing the search for a new international airport site, said Friday: 
"It is our consultants' conclusion that it is not feasible to use Brown Field 
as an airport." 
</P>
<P>
That finding, however, clearly provides an answer to the airport dilemma, 
according to Councilman Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the conclusion of every study over the last 20 years," Filner 
said. "And this one just validated it once again. We're back to where we 
started. . . . The only space available is Miramar (Naval Air Station). 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that's a real problem with the Navy, but I think we have to enter 
negotiations with the Navy at every level to get access to their facilities. 
The Navy has more than just Miramar . . . they have five sites in San Diego 
County. Surely, by looking at all those sites, somehow we can find some sort of 
a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials have repeatedly stated that they have no intention of leaving 
Miramar, and that it is unfeasible to share it with commercial aircraft. Mixing 
commercial and military operations would be dangerous, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
Filner, however, said he is undeterred by the Navy's position. Meanwhile, he 
called for the immediate implementation of the San Diego Unified Port 
District's plans to make Lindbergh Field safer, yet capable of handling more 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that's not a great solution, but it will allow us to meet our needs 
for the next two decades, until we can find another site or until Miramar 
becomes available," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego spent more than $400,000 for the Brown Field report and a 
December, 1989, Sandag study that listed three sites -- Miramar, Miramar East 
(West Sycamore Canyon) and Otay Mesa -- as possible sites for an international 
airport if Lindbergh Field was close. 
</P>
<P>
The search for a new site and plans to augment Lindbergh Field have been 
debated for nearly two decades, yet no immediate solution is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Some City Council members have called for a "multiple airport" solution and 
hoped that the study would show that Brown Field could handle commercial 
aircraft and alleviate dangerous crowding at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
But the study ruled out such an option, eliminating yet another site for an 
international airport -- which nearly all local officials agree is critically 
needed. Local economists have stated that the lack of an adequate airport will 
severely limit the economic growth of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Filner's recommendation and the Sandag study's conclusion were not welcomed by 
Councilman Ron Roberts, who has opposed any plans to expand Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the conclusion, but I don't necessarily agree with it," said Paul 
Grasso, chief of staff for Roberts. "We've had other consultants tell us 
different, that they can develop an approach at Brown Field that's better than 
what's available at Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what Ron would like to do is find out what they're basing their 
conclusions on and ask them questions about their conclusion. I think Ron will 
have a lot of questions." 
</P>
<P>
The study states that "the terrain would require either much 
steeper-than-normal approach angles or much shorter-than-normal final 
approaches into the runways from the east." The mountains would also require 
"much steeper-than-normal departure climb gradients than would normally be 
acceptable to air carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating such a conclusion, County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, along with 
Supervisor Leon Williams, led the board earlier this week to approve a motion 
directing the county staff to work with Sandag and the Navy to find a way to 
use Miramar for commercial and military aviation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a situation now where there is no other option but to move Lindbergh 
Field to Miramar," Bilbray said. "There have been people who have been trying 
to figure a way to shove an airport into Brown Field. Right from the start, 
because of the mountains, I could have told you that that's like trying to 
stuff 10 pounds of wool into a 5-pound bag."
