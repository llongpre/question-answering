WINCHELL: GOSSIP, POWER AND THE CULTURE OF CELEBRITY by Neal Gabler Knopf
Dollars 30, 681 pages
Modern journalism has its angels and its devils, its pundits and
polemicists, its scandal and hate-mongers and gossips and those whom even
the mightiest governments could not ignore. Yet surely no American in the
20th century has embodied all these qualities, good and bad, as much as
Walter Winchell.
Neal Gabler's vivid book is not merely the chronicle of an extraordinary
life. It is also an indispensable guide to the rise and rise of the tabloid
media. As one contemporary observer noted, 'calling Winchell a mere gossip
writer is like calling Lindbergh a mere aviator,' no mean compliment to the
son of impoverished Russian Jewish immigrants who started his working life
as a Vaudeville hoofer.
His 40-year journalistic career encompassed, consecutively, newspapers,
radio and the early days of television, with a brief digression into film.
All the great trends and events of his times were the subject of his pen and
voice. He was the principal chronicler of the glamour of Broadway in the
1920s, the flowering of the cafe society in New York in the 1930s and the
emergence of Hollywood.
Winchell practically invented celebrity journalism as we now know it. Damon
Runyon, his personal friend, Hemingway and Mencken all thought his style
unique and admirable but he made his enemies, too, like Ed Sullivan, a
contemporary rival and later the TV host who introduced the Beatles to
America.
But once established as the king of his gossip realm and with a radio
audience running into 70m a week, he turned to politics and the affairs of
the world. In one of his smartest acts, Franklin Roosevelt invited Winchell
round to the White House for a brief chat in the first week after his
presidential inauguration. No precise record of what passed between them
exists beyond the columnist's notoriously exaggerated recollection, but the
result was that the president acquired a supporter-for-life.
The New Deal had no larger public booster than Walter Winchell and, at a
time when fascism was a force in American politics, no more early and
vociferous American opponent than Adolf Hitler. Although Winchell was, like
the rest of his country, equivocal on whether the US should enter the war in
1939, he thought his president was right to support Britain with the
lend-lease programme - and British intelligence was smart enough to
understand his public influence and to feed him material (so, for different
ulterior motives, did J Edgar Hoover of the FBI).
His progressive record, most noteably on race relations, made it all the
more extraordinary that he joined Joe McCarthy's witch-hunt. Gabler traces
this to a famous incident at the Stork Club involving Josephine Baker, the
black entertainer, who walked out in disgust at not being served promptly.
This turned Winchell's anti-fascist guns on all 'ungrateful' liberals and
communists, with Hoover, as ever, stoking his fire. The columnist was there
at all the great Washington hearings of the mid-1950s, as much of a
celebrity as those on the bench and in the dock. As McCarthy fell, so did
Winchell and his reputation never recovered.
His decline into irrelevance and poverty again had its occasional
counterpoints. His distinctive machine gun voice could be heard again in the
early 1960s as the narrator of The Untouchables, the TV crime series; the
late Burt Lancaster caught his personality dead to rights in his portrayal
of JJ Hunsecker, the unscrupulous gossip columnist in the film The Sweet
Smell of Success.
But his spirit and approach does live today. As a gossip columnist, he
relied on and thus legitimised 'press agents,' forerunners of today's
ubiquitous public relations industry; current American fascination with
celebrity trials (OJ Simpson, the Menendez brothers, the Bobbitts and
Hardings) has roots in Winchell's intense coverage of Bruno Hauptmann,
convicted for kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. And if Rush Limbaugh, the
modern radio polemicist, and all his coterie want to look up family trees,
they need search no farther than Walter Winchell.
