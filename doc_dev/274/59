   Douglas ``Wrong Way''
Corrigan, going the right way this time, returned Monday to the
airfield where he landed his small plane 50 years ago after leaving
New York on a flight to California.
   ``Look, no hands!'' the 81-year-old American declared, arms
aloft in a triumphant gesture, as the commuter plane carrying him
from Dublin landed at Baldonnel Airport. Corrigan wore the same
leather flying jacket he had on when he landed here the first time.
   An army band, a Cabinet minister and the U.S. ambassador greeted
him, along with R.W. Sullivan, the aircraft engineer who met him on
the first trip.
   He came to Ireland by commercial jet for festivities celebrating
his famous wrong-way flight, then joined the pilot in the cockpit
of a propeller plane renamed WW2 _ or Wrong Way 2 _ for the
10-minute flight to Baldonnel.
   Corrigan has always said he misread his compass, headed east by
mistake, and did not know until his $900 Curtiss-Robin monoplane
pierced the clouds 28 hours later that he was over Ireland. He had
applied to fly the Atlantic, but was refused because the plane,
carrying 330 gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was
deemed too heavy to be safe over the ocean.
   Before leaving the United States for his first trip to Ireland
since, the Texas-born pilot hinted his story might change, but he
stuck to it at the initial ceremony.
   ``I followed the wrong end of the compass needle,'' he told
admirers at Baldonnel Airport. ``It's a simple thing to happen. It
shouldn't have happened. I was the first one to admit that I had
made a mistake and I was willing to correct it.''
   He recalled that the the runway at Baldonnel, now Irish air
force headquarters, was a grass strip the last time he landed there.
   ``I taxied up to a little shack where there were two men in
uniform,'' Corrigan said. ``I was in trouble until they found out
what my name was and the policeman said, `He's just another
Irishman coming home.'''
   U.S. Ambassador Margaret Heckler said Monday: ``I'm so proud of
you. You are amazing.''
   Corrigan said he had never really been in Ireland before because
he had no passport or other papers the first time he arrived.
``This time I'm in Ireland and I have the papers to prove it,'' he
said.
   Also present were Transport Minister John Wilson; Alice Glenn,
deputy lord mayor of Dublin, and David Kennedy, chief executive of
the national airline Aer Lingus, who wished ``a hearty cead mile
failte _ 100,000 welcomes _ to Mr. Douglas `Wrong Way' Corrigan.''
   Wilson congratulated the sprightly American on still being able
to fit into his 1938 flying jacket and said he hoped Corrigan's
plane, now partly dismantled at his home in Santa Ana, Calif.,
might one day return to Ireland for exhibit.
   When Corrigan landed in Ireland on July 18, 1938, after a flight
that was supposed to take him to Long Beach, Calif., he had only $3
in his pocket and knew no one, he said in an interview Sunday
before departing from New York.
   This time, accompanied by his son, Harry, and daughter-in-law,
Charlotte, Corrigan crossed the Atlantic in six hours as an honored
guest of Aer Lingus in a Boeing 747. The airline plans three days
of ceremonies for him.
   U.S. aviation authorities suspended Corrigan from flying for
five days after he his unauthorized trip to Dublin, but Americans
and the Irish loved his explanation.
   The results in the United States were a New York ticker-tape
parade, a meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a movie,
``The Flying Irishman,'' starring Corrigan as himself.
   He was a woodworker and took up aviation when he helped build
the Spirit of St. Louis, in which Charles Lindbergh made the first
solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927.
   Corrigan bought his own plane for $310 in 1931 and spent $590
modifying it for the trip.
