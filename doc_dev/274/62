   Deciding that it's never too late to
change, the mayor wants to give women here the right to vote.
   Actually, women in this east Tennessee town of 2,800 have been
voting since 1920, when the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
was ratified.
   But the town's 1902 charter still forbids it, and Mayor Roy Leach
says it's time to have it changed.
   ``I'd like to see them try to stop the women in Jellico from
voting,'' said Betty Douglas, wife of City Councilman Marvin
Douglas. ``They would have a riot on their hands.''

   There is such a thing as a free lunch _ just
ask about 1,000 people who patronized a downtown restaurant.
   Jamie Petrolias, owner of Jamie's on the Square, gave away free
chicken and cole slaw lunches Monday to promote his 2-week-old
eatery.
   ``We're just thrilled with the people who came out,'' Petrolias
said.
   The 25-year-old restaurateur, whose family has owned another
downtown restaurant for 55 years, said the crowd consumed 1,500
pounds of chicken, 150 pounds of cabbage and 15 gallons of salad oil.
   He estimated the giveaway cost him about $1,500, but added, ``I
really haven't figured it out myself. I'm afraid to.''
   Petrolias said he was pleased with the crowd, which was orderly
and friendly.
   ``We were just delighted,'' he said ``Our kitchen isn't gigantic,
and it was tough to keep up, but we managed.''

   Charlie Gettel has designed papier-mache heads of
the famous for Detroit's Thanksgiving Day parade for 45 years, but
to his surprise, parade organizers have had him immortalized.
   Organizers last week unveiled a 15-pound, baldheaded bust of
Gettel.
   ``They kept it a secret from me for eight months,'' said Gettel,
who has designed likenesses ranging from Henry Ford to Mickey Mouse
as decorations for parade floats. ``It was packed in the same huge
crate as (civil rights pioneer) Rosa Parks' head.
   ``When I pulled it out, I almost flipped. I was so flabbergasted
I got all red in the face. Now I'm immortalized. Even when I die
I'll be part of the parade.''
   This year, nine new heads will make their parade debut, including
likenesses of aviator Charles Lindbergh and rock singer Bob Seger,
Gettel said.
   The heads have become a major attraction at the Thanksgiving
procession, where children and adults make a game out of guessing
the identities of the lesser-known noggins.
   ``I just love it so much I can hardly call it a job,'' Gettel
said. ``To me, Thanksgiving lasts all year.''
