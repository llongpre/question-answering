<TEXT>
   Humorist-folklorist John Henry Faulk, who
faced blacklisting head-on with a lawsuit in the 1950s and became a
champion of civil rights, died April 9 after a long bout with
cancer. He was 76.
   Faulk was a popular CBS radio and television personality when,
in 1957, he mounted a six-year legal battle in a New York court
against AWARE Inc., a group that accused him of having subversive
associations.
   Faulk sued AWARE, saying the group had libeled him and destroyed
his career. He won the lawsuit and was awarded $3.5 million, but
the judgment was later reduced to $725,000 on appeal.
   He recounted the struggle in a best-selling book, ``Fear on
Trial.'' The book was made into a made-for-TV movie that was
broadcast on CBS in 1975.
   Faulk is survived by a wife and son.
