   Vice President Dan Quayle and his family
are coming home to Indiana for what a relative called a personal
trip.
   The Quayles plan to stay with Marilyn Quayle's stepmother, Elaine
Tucker of Trafalgar, and take their 10-year-old daughter Corinne to
camp, Tucker said.
   Indiana's former junior senator will arrive Sunday at Columbus
Municipal Airport and will travel by motorcade, said Bartholomew
County Sheriff Rick Hill.
   Tucker said she doesn't think the vice president has any speaking
engagements planned but said the family will probably visit Quayle's
grandmother, who lives in Franklin. Tucker said she has not seen the
family since the inauguration in January.

   Aviator Lisandro Garay-Mejia, once feted as the
``Honduran Lindbergh'' for his effort to fly from New York to his
native Honduras, has won U.S. citizenship for a second time.
   Garay wore his old Navy uniform and held a U.S. flag during
citizenship ceremonies Thursday in federal court.
   ``This is a wonderful present,'' said Garay, who turned 90 on
Wednesday.
   An early aviator in his country, Garay originally got his U.S.
citizenship in the 1920s to fly for the U.S. Navy. Through a ruse by
a politically hostile Honduran government in 1931, the United States
was misinformed that Garay was serving in the Honduran military at
the time, and his U.S. citizenship was withdrawn.
   He returned to the United States in 1985 after decades as a
banker and then a retiree in Honduras.
   Garay attempted more than 50 years ago to make the first flight
from New York to Honduras. He fell short, thanks to a hurricane, but
was feted as the ``Honduran Lindbergh'' anyway. He was honored on
his country's first air mail stamp.

   Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, a former Miss America,
will ride a horse-drawn carriage to church as she and longtime
boyfriend Charles Wilson are married Saturday before 800 onlookers.
   ``Kaye Lani is running around doing everything herself,'' said
her mother, Jacqueline Rafko. ``She's out there picking up the
programs, seeing that the tuxes fit and planning everything. ...
It's a lot of work.''
   Rafko, 25, a Monroe nurse who was crowned Miss America in
September 1987, and Wilson, 26, a computer analyst from Ann Arbor,
are to be married at St. Mary's Church in Monroe.
   Trumpets will play as her father, Lonnie Rafko, escorts her into
the church, according to family members.
   Rafko will wear a long-sleeved, white-satin gown, her mother
said. A harpist and the Rumplestiltskin band will perform at the
reception, along with former Miss Michigan Kelly Garver on fiddle.

   Rob Lowe, who is being sued in Atlanta by a
woman who claims the actor used her 16-year-old daughter in a sex
video, is now under fire from a street preacher who doesn't want
Lowe setting foot in his apartment co-op to film a new movie.
   John Medford, the preacher and church maintenance chief who lives
at the Glen Donald co-op just west of downtown, said his goal was to
make sure Lowe didn't corrupt the morals of the building's residents.
   Medford, 47, is trying to get the building's 70 residents to sign
a petition declaring they don't want Lowe on the property. So far,
he said he has collected 25 signatures.
   Lowe is accused in a lawsuit in federal court of videotaping a
sexual encounter between two women in his hotel suite while he
visited Atlanta last summer for the Democratic National Convention.
   In the new movie, ``Bad Influence,'' Lowe plays a character who
videotapes a couple in bed and a murder.
   Medford, who works at the Southern Baptist Church in Hollywood,
said he was offended by Lowe's alleged behavior, but he also objects
to the scenario of ``Bad Influence.''
   ``Lowe is influencing and ruining the youth,'' said Akos Szalas,
a 60-year-old retiree who signed Medford's petition.
   Not all residents agree.
   ``We've had Clint Eastwood here filming. His films weren't
biblical,'' said Elizabeth Wolder, 82.
   Erbun Flinchum, chairman of the committee that governs the
building, said a contract has been signed with Steve Tisch, the
movie's producer.
   ``The building needs the money,'' said Flinchum. ``We can't get
off into Rob Lowe's personal life. If he did something wrong, let
the courts decide.''
   Tisch isn't worried. ``The contract is binding,'' he said.
Besides, he added, Lowe has only one brief scene scheduled at the
apartment complex.

   Gospel-pop singer Amy Grant is expecting
her second child in December, a spokesman said Friday.
   Chaz Corzine, her tour manager, said the pregnancy will have
little effect on Grant's concert schedule, which tapers off after
early August.
   She and husband Gary Chapman, a singer-songwriter, also are
parents of a son, Matt, born in September 1987.
   Grant, 28, sang a No. 1 duet, ``Next Time I Fall,'' in 1986 with
ex-Chicago lead singer Peter Cetera. Her ``Unguarded'' and ``Age to
Age'' albums have sold more than 1 million copies apiece.
