   Hans Kloppenburg, a defense witness
for the man who was convicted and executed for the kidnap-murder of
aviator Charles Lindbergh's baby boy, died Tuesday at age 89.
   Kloppenburg was the best friend of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who
was convicted in the highly publicized 1935 trial for the
kidnap-murder of 20-month-old Charles Lindbergh Jr. three years
earlier.
   Kloppenburg testified that Hauptmann was given a shoe box of
money from a mutual acquaintance and that the money, which was later
traced to be part of the ransom payment, was unknowingly used by
Hauptmann.

   Dr. Thomas Holmes, one of the creators of a stress
scale of such ``life-change'' events as marriage and work troubles,
died Dec. 24 of a stroke at age 70.
   Holmes and Navy scientist Richard Rahe introduced the Social
Readjustment Rating Scale, now commonly known as the Holmes-Rahe
stress scale, in 1967. The scale consists of 43 events, ranging from
the death of a spouse to minor violations of the law, that can
indicate a susceptibility to some illnesses.
   Holmes joined the University of Washington psychiatry department
in 1949 and retired in 1984. He was the author of more than 150
articles in medical journals, several books and chapters in many
other books.

   John Lawe, 69, the one-time bus cleaner who led
35,000 workers in an 11-day transit strike in 1980, died Thursday of
cancer Thursday.
   Lawe, a longtime union activist, joined the Transport Workers
Union in 1949, the year he came to the United States from Ireland
and got a job as a bus cleaner for the old Fifth Avenue Coach Co.,
now a part of the Transit Authority.
   Beginning as a shop steward, he rose through the union ranks
during his 17 years as a cleaner and driver. During the TWU's 1966
citywide strike, Lawe served on the union's negotiating committee.
   In 1977, Lawe, was voted president of Local 100, and in that
position led the April 1980 strike that forced millions of commuters
to carpool or walk and cost the city about $1.1 billion in lost
business, more than $1 million a day in lost sales taxes and
$700,000 in police overtime.
   On May 1, 1985, he was sworn in as International President of the
TWU of America. The union, which represents 100,000 workers
nationwide, has had only three previous presidents: Michael Quill,
Matthew Guinan and William Lindner.
