<LEADPARA>  THE WHEELS of a Cessna 185 touched down on the tarmac of the Redding Airport
recently, ending the 41-year saga of veteran Department of Fish and Game pilot
Pat Symons.;   Symons, 67, was hired as a warden-pilot in 1950. Since then he
has logged more than 22,000 hours and 2.5 million miles flying every
imaginable type of mission for the DFG, including law enforcement, aerial fish
planting and wildlife surveys.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     To Symons, who with his wife, Joan, makes his home in Cottonwood, the last
day on the job was like any other.;   "I had two projects. One was a survey
flight over the Tehama Wildlife Area, most of which is closed to access this
time year, to make sure no one was locked up inside the area.;   "Then an
anadromous fisheries biologist climbed aboard and we cruised the Sacramento
River from Princeton to Keswick Dam looking for new salmon redds.";   Looking
back, Symons says that "Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic in 1927
fired the aviation mindedness of a lot of young people, including me.";   He
steered his education toward aeronautical engineering until World War II came
along. He joined the Air Corps and became a pilot, flying twin-engine C46
cargo planes over the "hump" -- the Himalayas -- in the Chinese-Burma-India
Theater.;   Following the war, Symons returned to school and earned a degree
in aircraft and engine maintenance and in 1950 went to work for the DFG.;  
"We used to do anything we could possibly think of," says Symons. "We flew air
patrols hunting for violators in all kinds of situations, but the most
dramatic and glamorous thing we did was high altitude fish planting.";  
Symons was one of the first pilots to do aerial fish plants in California.
"For all the glamour of aerial fish planting," says Symons, "it was a mass
production money-maker in the sense that it was the cheapest way to get fish
into the high mountain lakes.;   "There are a jillion tight lakes, some
because they are tiny, some because they're way, way down in a hole and you
have to point the plane straight down to get to them. Once in a while we'd
have a judgment screw-up and miss the lake, but that didn't happen very
often.";   Before moving to the Redding area in 1974, Symons spent 22 years in
Southern California, where he also flew ocean patrols and biological surveys
spotting sardines, mackerel, gray whales, harbor seals and sea otters. Flying
sea otter surveys was the hardest and most boring, according to Symons.;  
"There's nothing to see but a lot of glaring water and occasionally a little
pod of sea otters. But you have to pay attention because you have to keep
track of your flight lines.";   Some of his most rewarding work was flying law
enforcement flights in the 1950s. "I remember flying the Cleveland National
Forest out of San Diego," says Symons, "when I found what looked like a couple
of hunters in a closed area. I circled for a while waiting for a ground warden
to come in.;   "Apparently my circling flushed out several other people. The
ground wardens wrote 32 citations that weekend. When word got to the regional
office in Los Angeles I got a call from the inspector inquiring about the type
of sandbagging we were doing to come up with this good of a count.";   "More
recently I was working with Don Gastineau, the warden out of Crescent City.
The California crab season was closed and Don was concerned that a number of
Oregon boats would come into our closed waters. Because the weather was very
foggy, they did. Don and I, flying in the fog, were able to spot and identify
a number of boats, making a number of commercial cases.";   "The prettiest
flying was the spring flights to check the high mountain lakes," says Symons.
"We'd make two or three flights a week, checking on the break-up of the ice.  </TEXT>
