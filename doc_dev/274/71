<LEADPARA>  Douglas Corrigan, a mechanic and barnstorming pilot, wanted to fly his
single-engine plane to Ireland from New York, but the powers that be refused
to allow it, saying the flight was too dangerous. So he filed a flight plan
for L.A. and flew to Ireland anyway, arriving on this date in 1938, and
quickly was given the nickname of "Wrong Way" Corrigan. His explanation for
his error was that he somehow had been reading the wrong end of the magnetic
needle on his compass. Corrigan's only other claim to fame is that he was the
man who in 1927 pulled the chocks away from the Spirit of St. Louis for
Charles Lindbergh's historic flight.  </LEADPARA>
