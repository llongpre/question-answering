SANDAG REJECTS PROJECT IN AIRPORT FLIGHT PATH

<P>
Exercising new authority to halt development near Lindbergh Field for the first 
time, the San Diego Assn. of Governments has blocked plans for a $12.5-million 
medical office building in the airport's approach path. 
</P>
<P>
The regional government agency rejected the proposed Harborview Medical 
Building at 220 Elm St. Friday, ruling that the project would exceed occupancy 
limits designed to minimize the number of deaths and injuries in case of an 
airliner crash. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on a second project that would have exceeded the safety standard, a 
$58.5-million, eight-story, mixed-use development known as Hay Plaza, was 
postponed to allow developers and Sandag staff members to discuss occupancy 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Normally an advisory agency, Sandag acquired authority over land-use decisions 
around Lindbergh and five other county airports Jan. 1, under state legislation 
that gave such regional government agencies oversight for airports without city 
land-use plans. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has no land-use plan for the area around Lindbergh, 
though one should be completed within six months, said Jack Koerper, Sandag's 
special projects director. Sandag is also overseeing land-use decisions for the 
areas around Fallbrook, Ramona, Ocotillo Wells, Agua Caliente and Jacumba 
airports, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 1, Sandag has approved about 150 land-use proposals for the area 
near Lindbergh, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag staffers calculate that the 9-story Harborview medical building would 
hold 2,393 people per acre, far more than the 918 people per acre allowed under 
one of the safety regulations that Sandag is following, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
But James P. O'Neil, attorney for Harborview's developers, argued that the 
staffers "deliberately chose not to consider the portion of the site that 
contains the parking garage," an interpretation that would have sharply reduced 
the occupancy per acre statistic, he said.
