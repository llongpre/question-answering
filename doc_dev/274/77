CITY FUNDS BROWN FIELD STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday agreed to fund an $18,000 study by the 
San Diego Assn. of Governments to determine whether Brown Field can be expanded 
to handle takeoffs and landings of major airliners. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-day study is expected to give the council a glimpse of whether a "dual 
airport" concept, employing both Lindbergh and Brown fields for airline and 
cargo traffic, is technologically feasible and merits further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag will review a proposal for Brown drawn up by a private consultant to 
expand the city-owned general aviation airport and build two runways on a 
southwest-to-northeast axis. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council lifted a year-old building moratorium on residential, 
commercial and industrial development around Brown, virtually killing all 
chances for a large binational airport on Otay Mesa along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
That move effectively leaves the dual airport solution and joint 
civilian-military use of Miramar Naval Air Station as the only alternatives to 
increasingly crowded Lindbergh Field. The Navy is adamantly opposed to the 
second option. 
</P>
<P>
In another action Tuesday, the council authorized City Manager John Lockwood to 
begin negotiations to purchase land around the Brown Field airstrip that would 
be needed to extend the runway.
