   Adela Rogers St. Johns, an early
feminist and avowed ``sob sister'' who broke into the men's world
of newspapering on a $7-a-week salary and covered some of the
biggest stories of the century, is dead at 94.
   Mrs. St. Johns died Wednesday at the South County Convalescent
Hospital.
   During her 60-year career, she covered the abdication of King
Edward VIII, the assassination of Louisiana Sen. Huey Long and the
``trial of the century'' of Bruno Richard Hauptmann in the
kidnapping and murder of Charles A. Lindbergh's infant son.
   She sold her first story to the Los Angeles Times at age 9 and
became a protege of press baron William Randolph Hearst, who hired
her as a cub reporter at the San Francisco Examiner in 1913, when
there were few women in the newsroom.
   She later worked for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, another
Hearst paper, and the International News Service.
   She came out of retirement in 1976 to cover the bank robbery and
conspiracy trial of Hearst's granddaughter, Patricia, for the San
Francisco Examiner.
   ``She was a kind of wild, uninhibited woman before feminism came
in,'' said Mel Durslag, a syndicated sports columnist and 50-year
Hearst veteran.
   ``She was a tough, hard, newspaper woman, one of the guys. She
was a figure from the old roaring days of Hearst journalism, which
no longer lives.''
   Mrs. St. Johns claimed several firsts, including the first woman
to cover a police beat and the first allowed in the press box at
sporting events.
   Her ability to get juicy stories for Photoplay magazine won her
the nickname ``Mother Confessor of Hollywood.''
   An ardent feminist, she once wrote: ``I wish women would stand
together and shackle the men who want to move us backwards.''
   The ``sob sister'' defended her tear-jerking style, saying once,
``Unless you move the heart of the country you will never get it
moving.''
   In 1962, she published ``Final Verdict,'' about her father,
renowned criminal lawyer Earl Rogers. Perhaps her best-received
book was ``The Honeycomb,'' an autobiography published in 1969.
   Mrs. St. Johns was a longtime friend of former President Richard
Nixon, who cited her ``exceptional ability to reveal the human
story behind the news'' when she received the Medal of Honor in
1970.
   Survivors include three children, 10 grandchildren, 13
great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Funeral
services were scheduled for Tuesday in Glendale.
