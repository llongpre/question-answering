   Alma Sioux Scarberry, a reporter, writer,
entertainer and publicist whose career spanned more than seven
decades and included interviews with Charles Lindbergh, Babe Ruth
and Jack Dempsey, has died.
   She was 90.
   Ms. Scarberry, who moved to Austin in 1965, was ``a flamboyant
woman,'' said her longtime friend, Cactus Pryor. ``She had a lot of
color in her clothing and in her personality. She just had a lot of
verve.''
   Ms. Scarberry died Tuesday of a stroke at a San Antonio nursing
home.
   She got her start in reporting in 1919 at the Elmira (N.Y.)
Advertiser. She also worked for the New York Mirror, Pittsburgh
Sun-Telegraph, Washington Herald Times and King Features.
   Ms. Scarberry enjoyed telling tales from her days as a
journalist.
   ``She was accidentally knocked down by Jack Dempsey once,''
Pryor recalled. ``She and a bunch of other reporters were
interviewing him and he was demonstrating (a punch). I guess she
got in the way.''
   She wrote 21 novels, including ``Thou Shalt Not Love,'' ``The
Flat Tire'' and ``Dimpled Racketeer.''
   Ms. Scarberry also wrote songs for country singer Tex Ritter and
performed in Irving Berlin's Broadway show ``Music Box Revue'' in
1922 and 1923.
   ``She had a very full life and enjoyed good health through her
90th birthday,'' said her son, Theodore Klein Jr.
   In addition to Klein, survivors include four grandchildren. A
memorial service will be next week, Klein said.
