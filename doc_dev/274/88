Commended for their anti-drug stand at City Hall, a trio of pizza-chomping 
cartoon idols declared the members of the Los Angeles City Council to be 
honorary Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles on Wednesday.

The sewer-dwelling Heroes on the Half Shell handed out turtle masks to the 
council members while intoning their traditional "Cowabunga" yell.

A 27-year-old card player hit the jackpot the other day at the Bicycle Club in 
Bell Gardens. She had a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Security officer Al Rodriguez, responding to a report of a fainting at the 
Asian poker card table, assisted the expectant mother with her breathing 
techniques while awaiting the paramedics. Hung Duong, a card dealer, helped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ambulance could arrive, she gave birth to a 7-pound, 8-ounce boy in 
the club's VIP parking lot.

the public to offer traffic solutions. 
</P>

"One suggestion was to allow people to take their bicycles on the Blue Line and 
that's doable," Patsaouras said. "We're working on that right now. And I love 
the idea of having an artist portray, on the side of the bus, which community 
that bus is coming from. It creates pride in that area." 
</P>
<P>
He even saw possibilities for a suggestion to reduce gawkers by shielding 
accident scenes from the view of motorists with drapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand this method is used in Japan," Patsaouras said.

A ton of pumpkin-cinnamon ice cream, headed for American troops in Saudi 
Arabia, arrived at Long Beach Naval Station on Wednesday, courtesy of
