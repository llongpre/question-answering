Dead Calm (Cinemax Sunday at 10 p.m., Wednesday at 11:45 p.m., Friday at 10 
p.m.): Phillip Noyce's 1989 thriller is a spare, smart, seductive piece of real 
movie making with (almost) every loophole covered, a superlative cast and 
enough tension to keep us all hyperventilating for hours. Sam Neill and Nicole 
Kidman are on an extended South Pacific voyage when they cross paths with 
insinuating Billy Zane.

Zelig (Channel 13 Monday at 10 a.m.): This is a sweet, piercing, startlingly 
inventive film, a little rueful around the edges, in which Woody Allen fakes a 
documentary about one Leonard Zelig (played by Allen) who in his meteoric 
moment in the public eye stood somewhere between Charles Lindbergh and Babe 
Ruth. What emerges amid considerable technical brilliance and wit is a rather 
distanced commentary about the perils of living a life in a goldfish bowl.
