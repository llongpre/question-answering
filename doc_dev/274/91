SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 90-day construction moratorium for more than 3,100 acres around Brown Field 
was tentatively approved Tuesday by the San Diego City Council in an effort to 
preserve the city-owned general aviation airstrip for possible expansion into a 
major airport. 
</P>
<P>
If it receives final approval, the moratorium proposed by Councilman Ron 
Roberts will delay development while the San Diego Assn. of Governments 
determines whether the Otay Mesa airstrip can be expanded to relieve Lindbergh 
Field of some commercial airline traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag is reviewing a private consultant's report that indicates that two 
southwest to northeast runways could be built on Brown Field, allowing a 
possible "multiple airport solution" to the longstanding and worsening problem 
of crowding at Lindbergh, the region's only major airport. The Sandag response 
is due within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, land situated roughly in a swath where the two parallel runways 
would be put was included in the building moratorium. However, 240 acres of 
subdivisions where industrial projects are close to breaking ground were 
exempted from Roberts' original ban, which covered about 3,400 acres.
