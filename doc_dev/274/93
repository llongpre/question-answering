Though 46 years have passed, the moment remains vivid to Jean-Luc Beghin. He 
can still see the planes chasing each other in the skies over war-torn 
Brussels. The German plane, he remembers, was dark and menacing. The other, an 
American fighter, its engine thundering, was brightly decorated with huge white 
stars on its wings and fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dogfight," Beghin says of that spring day in 1944. "I was in 
kindergarten and all the kids wanted to watch." 
</P>
<P>
Beghin does not remember much about the German plane. "I was only 5 years old 
at the time," he explains. But he recalls every detail about the American 
fighter and especially the words of one teacher who joined her students staring 
up at the sky. "I remember her saying, 'That's a Mustang.' " 
</P>
<P>
The P-51 Mustang. Just the name brings a smile to Beghin. For it was, he says, 
more than a fighter plane. It was a symbol. Proud. Flashy. Powerful. "It was my 
image of America," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Beghin lives in Westchester, only a mile or so from the former North 
American Aviation plant where the P-51 was born and built. And Beghin is among 
those celebrating the 50th anniversary today of the fighter's first test flight 
over Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old artist is completing a pen-and-ink rendition of the aircraft's 
cockpit for the French aviation magazine, Info Pilote. The publication's 
six-page tribute to the P-51 will be among many celebrations worldwide, 
including air shows and exhibits this weekend from Santa Maria, Calif., to 
Duxforth, England. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the anniversary tributes will be any more personal than Beghin's. 
For the P-51 Mustang inspired Beghin as a boy and launched a love affair with 
aviation that continues today, particularly in his pen-and-ink drawings of 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my main purpose in life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
From his days as an aviation illustrator for the Belgian Air Force to his 
employment today as a flight coordinator for Air France, Beghin's life has 
revolved around aviation. 
</P>
<P>
His works, displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and NASA's Houston Museum, 
depict aircraft subjects ranging from Charles Lindbergh's "Spirit of St. Louis" 
to the Apollo cockpit. In all, about 20 renderings by Beghin have been 
commissioned for aviation exhibits and publications. 
</P>
<P>
Now, those works will be joined by Beghin's drawings of the P-51, an aircraft 
originally commissioned by the Royal Air Force only months before the United 
States joined World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1940, the British were short of fighter planes and came to North American 
Aviation, which had built the AT-6 trainer for England," says Beghin, who has 
followed the P-51's history since his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Given four months to design and build a new fighter for England, the aircraft 
company (later absorbed by Rockwell International) unveiled the P-51 Mustang, a 
sleek, soaring aircraft faster than any fighter before it. Soon, the aircraft 
established itself as the finest American-built fighter used by the Royal Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the United States began purchasing the fighters, the RAF had 
replaced the Mustangs' unreliable first engines with 1,600-horsepower engines 
built by Rolls-Royce. Later, the same engines, built in the United States by 
Packard, were installed in the P-51s commissioned by the U.S. Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The new engines allowed the P-51 a top speed of 487 miles an hour. And the 
addition of auxiliary fuel tanks extended its flying range enough for the 
aircraft to escort American bombers all the way from England to Berlin. Those 
bombers included the B-17, whose exploits have been popularized in the current 
movie, "Memphis Belle." 
</P>
<P>
"It became the greatest fighter plane in the world," says Beghin. 
</P>
<P>
After Germany unveiled the world's first jet fighter, it was a P-51, flown by 
the soon-to-be-famous test pilot Chuck Yeager, that downed a Messerschmidt 262. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, when Beghin was a boy, it was a P-51 that he remembers helping 
to liberate his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he says, his fascination with the aircraft has never waned. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he spoke with the P-51's designer, Edgar Schmued, who lived in Rancho 
Palos Verdes and died in 1985. And two months ago, Beghin took his first flight 
in a P-51 during a trip to Paris. "When we took off, I had some tears in my 
eyes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, Beghin adds, he will finally finish a book on the P-51 Mustang. "I've 
been working on it for some time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he will continue his drawings. And, he says, there are plenty 
of memories of the P-51 that will forever connect him to his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time, just after the war, when Beghin bought package after package of 
Belgium chocolate bars, just to collect an aviation history card of the P-51 
Mustang. "Some of my friends had the card and I kept buying the chocolate just 
to get one. I don't remember how many bars I finally ate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Or the moment, after Belgium's liberation in September, 1944, when Beghin got 
his first close look at one of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a Mustang on display in the public square. I remember going up and 
touching the bare metal and seeing the plane up close. The bright colors and 
that white star. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," he says, "like Disneyland before its time."

fighter. AXEL KOESTER / For The Times; Photo, GOLDEN MEMORIES: As a young boy 
in Brussels he first saw one of America's great fighter planes, and Jean-Luc 
Beghin continues to be inspired by the P-51 Mustang. Now he celebrates the 50th 
anniversary of the plane's first flight.
