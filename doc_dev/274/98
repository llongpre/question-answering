The Mafia can usually be relied on to make a good story. Most promising
programme of the evening is Allied to the Mafia (BBC 2, 8.10), in which the
historical documentary series 'Timewatch' examines the nuts and bolts of the
mutually rewarding relationship which the Americans struck up with the Mafia
ahead of the Allied landings in Sicily, 50 years ago.
Clive James - Fame in the Twentieth Century (BBC 1, 9.30) is a series which
thus far threatens to make no demands on anyone's grey cells. Tonight
James's survey of people in the limelight looks at the late 'twenties and
early 'thirties, the period which saw the arrival of the 'talkies', the
reluctantly famous Charles Lindbergh, and the infamous Al Capone. But if you
are looking for something more taxing the nature of scientific research is
explored in the concluding part of Culture Clash (BBC 2, 11.15).
Unless your New Year's resolution was to wade through Richardson's enormous
novel, there is much to be said for watching Clarissa (BBC 2, 9. 25), the
well-made TV adaptation in three parts which tonight returns for its second
run.
