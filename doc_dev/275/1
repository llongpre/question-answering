  [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- United Nations Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali praised Russian diplomats for their 
contribution to the peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia in 
his speech at the Moscow State Institute of International 
Relations. 
  The U.N. secretary general said that the solution to the 
problem of Sarajevo and Tuzla was found thanks to Russian 
initiatives. 
  As concerns the participation of a Turkish contingent in the 
international peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, 
Butrus- Ghali said it would play no negative role in the region. 
The United Nations is an international organisation, and its 
peacekeeping forces must also be international, he said. 
  Asked about the international community's role in the 
Middle- 
East peace process, the secretary general pointed to the mission 
of the U.N. peacekeepers in the conflict zone. He welcomed any 
initiatives designed to promote the peace process in the 
Middle-East. 
  Butrus-Ghali said the international community is interested 
in expanding the presence of the United Nations and Russia in 
the peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union. He noted that the main pitfall on this path was 
financial, as the budget of the U.N. peacekeeping efforts has 
increased considerably in the past two years.
