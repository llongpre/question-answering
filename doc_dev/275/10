  [Text] At the House of External Economic Relations today, 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali held talks with 
Belarusian Foreign Minister Krawchanka. In the course of these 
talks, various aspects of international life were discussed, as 
well as issues concerning Belarusian participation in the 
activities of this authoritative international organization. 
Given that the talks were held behind closed doors, I asked the 
officials for a short interview. 
  Could you brief us on the essence of your conversation? 
  [Begin recording] [Butrus-Ghali, in English fading into 
Belarusian translation] We have had a very constructive and 
positive meeting with the Belarusian minister of foreign 
affairs. We discussed the activities of the United Nations, the 
disaster at Chernobyl, and the possible participation of 
Belarusian peacekeeping forces in various operations around the 
world. We will have a second round of discussions, during which 
we will continue with the agenda of different items agreed for 
the exchange of information. 
  [Krawchanka] I have presented [Butrus-Ghali] with two 
concrete drafts -- not mere declarations, not just general 
words, but two documents. The first project, worth 
approximately $12 million, provides for radiological and 
ecological monitoring on Belarusian territory. We hope that the 
UN Headquarters will find funds for this endeavor. The other 
project, which is worth $8 million, is aimed at building a 
factory to produce ecological baby food for Chernobyl children. 
We take quite an active part in many international activities, 
and the arrival of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is proof that 
the international community recognizes the complex problems 
facing our motherland. [end recording] 
  Later today, the UN general secretary held a meeting at the 
CIS Executive Secretariat. CIS Executive Secretary Ivan 
Karatchenya expressed gratitude to Butrus-Ghali for finding time 
to visit the CIS Headquarters in Minsk. He thanked the guest 
for the resolution passed by a UN session and the UN Secretariat 
on granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations. This 
will undoubtedly increase the prestige of the CIS as a regional 
international organization. The executive secretary also 
briefed Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the structure of the coordinating 
bodies of the CIS, as well as their tasks and goals. These 
include the reduction of conflicts on CIS territory and 
multifarious activities in the sphere of economic integration. 
  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, in his turn, pointed out 
that 
granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations is just 
the first step toward recognizing the CIS as an entity of 
international law. The United Nations is closely observing the 
activities of the CIS, and is interested in increasing the 
latter's peacekeeping and humanitarian role. According to Mr. 
Butrus-Ghali, the UN Secretariat is ready to closely cooperate 
with the executive bodies of the CIS in various spheres. 
  At the end of the first day of his visit, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali 
visited the UN mission in Belarus. Incidentally, this is the 
first UN mission opened in a CIS state.
