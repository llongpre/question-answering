<F P=106> [Second of two-part "exclusive" interview with UN Secretary </F>
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by Franz-Olivier Giesbert, Jacques 
Jacquet-Francillon, and Charles Lambroschini; place and date not 
given: "Butrus-Ghali Denounces Bad Payers"] 
  [Text] [LE FIGARO] What are you most proud of since you 
took over the post of secretary general of the United Nations 
two years ago? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We were successful in Cambodia and in El 
Salvador. The fact that we could offer aid to millions of 
Somalis is also a success. There is no longer famine in 
Somalia. This is to the credit of the United Nations. We are 
also helping two million Yugoslavian refugees. Two million is 
nothing to sneeze at. We brought 360,000 refugees back to 
Cambodia. That is something. We successfully kept the peace in 
Mozambique, where we obtained major results. Elections are to 
be held on 27 April in South Africa. You might say: "You had 
nothing to do with that," but that is simply not true. We 
contributed a lot to this operation by sending observers there. 
We are going to send another 1,700 in the coming weeks. These 
are positive elements that you can see on the ground. 
  [LE FIGARO] Very well. So what was your big failure? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The thing I am least proud about is the fact 
that I have not managed to attract greater attention -- in the 
philosophic sense of the word -- from the member states as to 
the importance of the United Nations. The United Nations is a 
tool which they still hesitate to use. They say all the right 
things, and they make a lot of promises, but when the time comes 
to face up to reality, they hesitate.... 
  [LE FIGARO] Out of all the UN member states, how many do not 
pay their dues? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] At the end of last year, only 60 out of 184 
had paid their contribution to the ordinary budget. 
  [LE FIGARO] And the preceding years too? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It was even worse. 
  [LE FIGARO] What about the peacekeeping operations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We must owe about $1.2 billion out of a total 
of $3.6 billion. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are there any bad payers on the Security 
Council? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly, the United States and Russia. The 
United States is late, and Russia does not pay. This means that 
the good pupils, the ones who send us troops, are punished 
indirectly because we cannot pay them what we owe them for their 
contribution to the peacekeeping forces. 
  [LE FIGARO] You cannot reimburse France? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We reimburse France with a delay of one year. 
We reimburse Sweden with a delay of two years. I have received 
complaints from Tunisia, Egypt, Uruguay, and Jordan, all of whom 
want to withdraw their troops. Just yesterday morning, I 
received telegrams from two countries which have not received 
their contribution to the operations in Cambodia that ended last 
September. As a result, these two countries -- Tunisia and 
Bangladesh -- are refusing to send additional troops to Somalia. 
We are going to end up with insurmountable problems on our 
hands because of this financial crisis. 
  [LE FIGARO] One of the reforms of the UN Charter, which you 
mention often during your trips around the world, is the reform 
of the composition of the Security Council. This would 
essentially be a new allocation of permanent seats. How do you 
see things? How many new permanent members do you envisage? 
How would the veto right be allocated differently? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] First of all, this is a decision which, in 
accordance with Article 108 of the Charter, must be made by the 
General Assembly. I play no role in it. 
  [LE FIGARO] Really? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Following the initiative taken by the General 
Assembly, I sent a questionnaire to all the member states, to 
which I have received already some 70 replies. A consensus has 
emerged from these replies in favor of increasing the number of 
members on the Security Council, since when the United Nations 
was founded, it consisted of only 50 states, whereas it now has 
184. It has also been emphasized that the expansion of the 
Security Council must be limited so that it can continue to 
operate well. 
<H5>  General Relaxation </H5>
  [Butrus-Ghali continues] There is also emphasis on the fact 
that we should move quickly in order to take advantage of the 
celebration of the United Nations' 50th anniversary in 1995, and 
to carry out the reform. However, that is where the consensus 
ends. So we risk opening a Pandora's box, in that some 30 member 
states feel -- rightly or not -- that they deserve a permanent 
seat on the Security Council. From there we can indulge in 
academic exercises: We could envisage new permanent members 
which do not have the veto right, etc. 
  [LE FIGARO] The same names always come up: Germany and 
Japan. In order to have the rest of the world better 
represented, are there any other countries, like India, Brazil, 
Argentina, Nigeria, etc.? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I do not want to make any comment regarding 
any of these countries. I do not wish to create problems for 
myself. 
  [LE FIGARO] Surely India is pretty inevitable? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Everything depends on the vote, you know. 
There will be a political debate in the General Assembly, whose 
members are going to vote. However, do not forget that in the 
final analysis, we will still have to have the agreement of the 
five permanent members. Any revision of the Charter will only 
be valid after it has been ratified by the five permanent 
members of the Security Council -- all of whom have the veto 
right -- even if the resolution has been passed by a national 
assembly in which there is no veto right. 
  [LE FIGARO] So...? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] To my mind, what counts is not so much the 
reform, but the fact that via this reform I can attain greater 
participation by the most important member states in the role of 
the United Nations. 
  [LE FIGARO] So now we are coming back to your initial 
remarks. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, the lack of political will on the part 
of 
the large countries. 
  [LE FIGARO] The lack of leadership...American leadership. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, I do not agree with you on that. American 
leadership used to be counterbalanced by another leadership. We 
had a bilateral system, bipolarism. Once one of the leaderships 
disappeared and collapsed, we emerged into a system which we 
cannot control. Nobody knows what has to be done anymore. The 
fact is that the very big member states are not up to their 
importance. Whether in Latin America or Asia, member states are 
not playing the role they should be playing -- a role they could 
afford to play if they had the political will to do so. 
  [LE FIGARO] In more general terms, do you mean that all the 
nations are less interested today than before in the affairs of 
the rest of the world? That everyone is withdrawing into their 
own problems? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, I repeat: There is a kind of laxness. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you explain it? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The end of the Cold War created a general 
relaxation. We are confronted with new phenomena. 
  [LE FIGARO] With a confirmed political will and a clearer 
vision of what we could have done, do you think that we could 
have stopped the escalation of hostilities in Yugoslavia by 
intervening just after the first confrontations between Croats 
and Serbs? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is very difficult to answer that question. 
A political will must not be expressed just at the beginning. 
It must be constant. That is the true lesson. The problem of 
peace is like the problem of health. You cannot allow yourself 
to go on a diet for two weeks. If you stop, you will get sick 
again. There must be continuity in peacekeeping operations: 
before, during the conflict, and afterwards. You must not stop 
checking up on the patient. There must be permanent attention. 
It is like cleaning the streets of Paris.
