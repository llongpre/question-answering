<F P=106> ["Core" column by editorial staff member Tadahiko Nasa and </F>
political department reporter Uichiro Oshima: "`Butrus-Ghali's 
Diplomacy Toward Japan' Has Changed"; first paragraph is 
newspaper introduction] 
  [Text] After finishing a five-day visit to Japan, UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali headed toward Korea on 22 
December. It was his second visit to Japan following his visit 
last February. Compared to his first visit, which gave an 
impression that "the UN secretary general is a hard-liner," his 
remarks during his recent visit on such issues as Japan's 
Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations (PKO) were extremely moderate. In his talks with 
Japanese leaders, he expressed his strong hope that in the near 
future Japan will play a nonmilitary role as a permanent member 
of the UN Security Council [UNSC]. The following is a report on 
the purpose of the visit by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, 
whose position on Japan has softened. 
<H5>  Stand of "Paying Attention to Japan" </H5>
  Although it is unusual for the UN secretary general to visit 
Japan twice in one year, there was a reason. 
  In Egypt, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's homeland, 
there 
is a prominent poet named "Hafez Ibrahim" [as published], who 
wrote a poem called "The Mikado" [Emperor] which praises Japan's 
victory in its war with Russia as a model for the Third World. 
  This poem is very famous in Egypt and is even in a textbook. 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who is 71 years old now, 
said he also learned from this poem in his younger days and then 
deepened his understanding of Japan. The fact that his 
itinerary for both the first and second visits specially 
included a visit to the Togo Shrine in Harajuku, Tokyo, reflects 
his interest in Japan. 
  In a 22 December news conference at the National Press Club, 
the secretary general said "Japan's winning a permanent seat on 
the UNSC will lead to strengthening the United Nations," showing 
his stand of attaching importance to Japan. It can be said that 
underlying such remarks is his understanding of Japan, which he 
fostered in his younger days. 
  Meanwhile, however, we felt that the secretary general, who 
is regarded as "an experienced politician" (from a Foreign 
Ministry source), made such remarks in consideration of the 
Hosokawa government, which is regarded as being "fragile." In 
preparation for his visit to Japan, the secretary general 
reportedly gathered detailed information from Yoshio Hatano, the 
ambassador accredited to the United Nations, on the ruling 
coalition's internal situation, Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
political position, and other problems facing Japan. 
  In separate talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Foreign 
Minister Hata, and leaders of the ruling and opposition parties, 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali stressed that "there seems to 
be a misunderstanding in Japan that the dispatch of military 
members to the UN PKO is the precondition for Japan's winning a 
UNSC permanent membership." He also said: "Of UN activities, 
the PKO accounts for about 30 percent and the remaining 70 
percent is for environmental protection, economic development, 
and the other activities." In this way, in an attempt to help 
promote the people's interest in gaining a UNSC permanent 
membership, he emphasized Japan's greater contributions to 
nonmilitary affairs. 
<H5>  "Bitter Experience" in February </H5>
  Behind the UN secretary general's strong desire for a 
Japanese visit in December is his bitter experience during his 
last visit in February. Before he visited in February, he had 
said in an interview in New York that "Japan should take part in 
the UN peace enforcement troops, even by revising its 
Constitution." This remark shocked Japanese Government 
officials including (then) Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  Shocked at his remark, Yohei Kono, the then chief cabinet 
secretary (currently the president of the Liberal Democratic 
Party], in his meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, 
affirmed that, "Japan has no intention of becoming a UNSC 
permanent member." (Then) Prime Minister Miyazawa also showed 
cautious views on Butrus-Ghali's remarks on the plea of "Japan's 
Constitution" and "the people's feelings." 
<H5>  Issues Facing the United Nations </H5>
  There are other reasons for UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's taking a favorable position on Japan. One is 
that he, in his two-year service so far, has come to realize how 
Japan holds an important position in the United Nations. 
  Although Japan's current assessed contribution to the United 
Nations is 12.45 percent, it seems it may be raised to about 13 
percent starting in 1995. In addition, Japan, in line with 
Prime Minister Hosokawa's attendance at the September UN General 
Assembly session, generously contributed approximately $100 
million to PKO activities. For the United Nations, which is 
facing financial difficulties, Japan is an important sponsor. 
Therefore, it is natural for the secretary general to consider 
it expedient to win Japan over to his side. 
  Another reason is that because of a PKO success in Cambodia, 
the secretary general himself has started considering that a 
traditional PKO method is more realistic than a forcible method 
under the "peace enforcement troops," which he proposed in July 
1992. Under the traditional PKO, there would be room for Japan 
to make human resources contributions. 
  As far as Japan's PKO is concerned, what is drawing UN 
attention is how Japan will deal with the issue concerning 
former Yugoslavia. The Japanese Government has announced its 
plan to send fact-finding missions there early next January. 
After the completion of the fact-finding survey, attention will 
then be focused on whether Japan will make personnel 
contributions in addition to its financial cooperation. 
  On the issue of personnel contributions, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, 
chief of the UN peacekeeping forces [PKF] in former Yugoslavia, 
has recently expressed the hope that Japan will take part in 
rear-echelon support troops. Although the connection between 
his remarks and Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's position is not 
clear, the government is negative about sending SDF troops to 
former Yugoslavia at present. 
  The Defense Agency [DA] was nervous about UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali's Japanese visit because it feared that 
"Butrus-Ghali might ask the government to send the SDF to former 
Yugoslavia." 
  Underlying the DA's anxiety is the fact that just before 
Butrus-Ghali's visit, Yasushi Akashi, who is to head the UN PKF 
in the former Yugoslavia, indicated his view that it is possible 
for Japan to join the PKF under the current PKO cooperation law 
if Japan's activity is limited to rear-echelon support. 
  In response, DA Director General Kazuo Aichi met with Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and indicated the DA's cautious view on 
Akashi's proposal; and senior DA officials, including Shigeru 
Hatayama, DA administrative vice minister, also indicated a 
cautious attitude in an effort to check General Secretary 
Butrus-Ghali's move. A voice within the DA has been expressed 
that what made Butrus-Ghali refrain from referring to this issue 
is "the DA's defensive move" (according to a senior DA 
official), thus reflecting DA officials' relief. 
  The reason the DA is cautious about sending the SDF to 
former 
Yugoslavia is that its dispatch would be criticized for running 
counter to the PKO cooperation law that stipulates that "a 
cease-fire agreement should be reached between conflicting 
parties" before the dispatch of Japanese troops. 
  Since a cease-fire accord has often been scrapped in former 
Yugoslavia, the DA points out that the case in former Yugoslavia 
is different from that in Cambodia, wherein the DA says "the 
cease-fire accord was kept although there were sporadic 
conflicts." In this way, the DA stresses that "it is not a 
matter of a type of PKO activities there but of the PKO law." 
  With regard to Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's remarks, 
there is a voice within the DA that "Butrus-Ghali now fully 
understands Japan's difficult position on the PKO." Meanwhile, 
among senior officials, another view has also been expressed: 
"Secretary General Butrus-Ghali must have given priority to 
Japan's contribution in such areas as financial affairs other 
than PKO activities."
