  [Text] U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali met with 
Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense Agency, and Yohei 
Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], 
separately in Tokyo on 21 December. 
  Speaking about U.N. peacekeeping operations (PKO) in the 
meeting, Aichi expressed willingness to cooperate in the PKO 
efforts, saying: "The Defense Agency wants to participate in the 
United Nations' activities as much as possible." Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali expressed his hope for Japan's 
contributions, saying: "Japan's participation is desirable, if 
only in symbolic forms, to help the United Nations strengthen 
itself in the long term." 
  In the meeting with LDP President Kono, Butru-Ghali spoke 
about the issue of nuclear inspection of North Korea. He said 
he is willing to play the role of an intermediary between the 
United States and North Korea, saying: "If North Korea wants to 
hold talks with the United States, I am willing to convey its 
intention to the United States."
