  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Mar (NA) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali said today that the decision to send a 
peacekeeping force to Bosnia "is the exclusive responsibility of 
the Argentine Government." He also categorically denied that he 
had "demanded financial support" from the Carlos Menem 
administration. 
  In a news conference held at the UN office in the Recoleta 
Cultural Center in this capital, Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that 
the decision to send a unit of Blue Helmets to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina "must be made by the Argentine Government." 
  The UN secretary general clarified this issue after the 
Argentine Government decision to accept a UN request to 
contribute 150 soldiers to the hottest spot in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  He said: "The United Nations requests the troops, and we 
specify the mission to every state member, but each government 
defines the type of aid it can provide. In some cases it can 
contribute personnel, and in other cases weapons. The aid will 
always be welcome." 
  In this regard he said the United Nations "can act as 
mediator" among the states that intend to provide troops, 
weapons, or transportation means. He made it clear that 
"pressure will never be exerted on a government to make a 
contribution" of this kind. 
  Butrus-Ghali also pointed out that "no request for money was 
made to Argentina," thus rejecting a report indicating that the 
United Nations had requested from the government a contribution 
of $10 million for financing various peacekeeping missions 
around the world." 
  He said: "Argentina has paid its UN dues. It is the United 
Nations that owes money to Argentina. But the problem is that 
the United Nations is going through a financial crisis in 
carrying out missions of this type and with the characteristics 
it considers necessary." 
  He also indicated that states "must be convinced" to pay 
their dues "for the symbolic value, among other things, of 
cooperating to preserve peace among members." 
  Butrus-Ghali said the United Nations "is an instrument at 
the 
service of the state members." He added: "No country finds 
military intervention in another country acceptable, unless it 
is coordinated by the United Nations." 
  Butrus-Ghali also said that it had been decided to increase 
the number of Security Council members based on the hundreds of 
letters sent by UN members. 
  He said: "The majority are in favor of reforming the 
Security Council created in 1945, when there were only 50 
members. We now have 184 countries, and it is therefore 
necessary to have new members on the council." 
  He believes the number of countries making up the Security 
Council "will be increased to 18 or 19 members," although he 
explained that it would be impossible for the change to be made 
next year, when the United Nations will celebrate its 50th 
anniversary. 
  He said the main current problems are "the ethnic wars" 
within states, which he labeled micronationalisms 
[micronacionalismos]. He said the UN mission "is to reconcile 
the different positions." 
  He added: "UN actions are no longer restricted to keeping 
the peace. It has to demobilize armies that are not linked to a 
peace negotiating process, and must also rebuild bridges, roads, 
hospitals, and schools after the war is over."
