<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali by unidentified RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent, 
commissioned by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA; date, place not given: 
"Butrus Butrus-Ghali: I Am Inspired by the Active Efforts of 
Russian Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on 
an official visit in Moscow yesterday. He plans to meet with 
President Boris Yeltsin, the leadership of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly State Duma and Federation Council, 
the foreign and defense ministers, and also with Aleksiy II, 
patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. 
  Butrus Butrus-Ghali pointed out that he visited Moscow many 
times while he was Egyptian foreign minister. This is the 
second time that he has been to the Russian capital in his 
capacity as UN secretary general. He said that one of the main 
aims of his visit to the Russian Federation is to "strengthen 
direct ties with the country's leadership" and also to help 
"boost Russia's contribution to UN activity." 
  Before his arrival he gave an exclusive interview for 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Do you support the idea that Russia's 
efforts to avert and resolve conflict situations on the 
territory of the former USSR should receive international 
status? To what extent and in what way is the United Nations 
Organization prepared to take part in peacekeeping efforts in 
places like Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Tajikistan, and the 
Dniester Region? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] As for the conflicts that have been unleashed 
in certain independent states on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, the United Nations and the CSCE have agreed on a 
division of labor with a view to preventing duplication of 
effort. In accordance with this formula the CSCE has assumed a 
peacekeeping role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in Moldova, 
and in Georgia -- South Ossetia. While the United Nations, on 
the other hand, has taken the lead with regard to the conflicts 
in Tajikistan and between Georgia and Abkhazia. You may be 
aware that the United Nations opened a small mission in 
Tajikistan in late 1992. My new special envoy to Tajikistan, 
Ambassador Piriz-Ballon [name as transliterated], recently got 
the parties to the conflict to agree to meet in Moscow. 
  A UN observers' mission in Georgia was opened by the 
Security 
Council last August. This is the first operation of its kind on 
the territory of one of the former Soviet republics. My special 
envoy in Georgia, Ambassador Brunner [name as transliterated], 
has held several rounds of political talks with representatives 
of the Georgian Government and the Abkhazians. The Russian 
Federation is acting as mediator in the Georgian-Abkhazian peace 
process and my special envoy has received vigorous support from 
[Russian] Deputy Foreign Minister Pastukhov, President Yeltsin's 
special envoy in Georgia. We are continuing our efforts to seek 
an all-embracing solution to this conflict. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Whenever questions of the former USSR's 
Baltic republics are examined, the United Nations only places 
emphasis on the Russian troop withdrawal, while Russia 
underlines its concern over the violation of ethnic minorities' 
political and civil rights in the Baltics. Do you think that 
this problem exists and merits the attention of the United 
Nations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The General Assembly has extended my 
mediator's mandate with regard to the troop withdrawal from the 
Baltic republics. Last year my special envoy, Ambassador Tommy 
Cox, visited Moscow and the three Baltic countries and I 
reported back to the General Assembly on his information and 
findings. I am inspired by the recent Latvian-Russian agreement 
and I hope that the talks between Estonia and Russia, which are 
expected to resume early in April, will also be completed 
shortly. 
  I know that 25 million Russians have ended up outside Russia 
as a result of the breakup of the former Soviet Union. What is 
more, I know about the difficulties which Russians living 
outside their homeland, including in Estonia and Latvia, are 
experiencing. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] The moves to form a Muslim-Croat 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to some extent contravene the 
peace plan that was agreed with the participation of the UN 
special envoy, a plan which presupposed creating a confederation 
of three ethnic states in Bosnia, precisely indicating their 
territories and borders. Does the United Nations intend to 
formulate a new initiative for an all-embracing settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the former Yugoslavia as a whole? How 
do you see Russia's role in resolving the Yugoslav conflict? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I welcome the recent agreement between the 
Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Croats regarding the formation 
of a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The cochairmen of the 
Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former 
Yugoslavia also welcomed this accord. At the same time I very 
much hope that representatives of the Bosnian Serbs will take 
part in the talks to find a settlement to the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near future. The Conference on the 
Former Yugoslavia will continue its work since it is the 
Security Council's approved means of securing an all-embracing 
settlement to all the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. 
  I am inspired by Russian diplomacy's vigorous creative 
efforts with regard to the former Yugoslavia. In particular, I 
welcome the recent talks between representatives of Serbian 
Krajina and the Croatian Government that took place in Russia's 
embassy in Zagreb under the auspices of Deputy Foreign Minister 
Churkin. I am grateful to Russia for its help for the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in unblocking Tuzla Airport and for 
Russia's willingness to send an extra 300 servicemen to the 
UNPROFOR.
