  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- A meeting between President 
Boris Yeltsin and U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has 
begun in the Kremlin. Greeting his guest, Yeltsin said that the 
world situation had changed during the past two years. Blocs 
ceased to exist, and for this reason "the role of the United 
Nations organisations became absolutely different." The 
president explained that "the U.N. has become more active of 
late, and its role in settling some controversial problems has 
been enhanced." 
  Yeltsin intends to discuss with Butrus Butrus-Ghali the key 
problems dealing with the functioning of the U.N. and with the 
work of the Security Council. They may touch upon other 
problems, including a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis.
