  [Text] United Nations February 16 TASS -- U.N. Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali met here on Wednesday with Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  During the meeting, Nazarbayev moved an initiative to 
convene 
a special session of the U.N. General Assembly on the 
post-confrontation period. The participants in the meeting also 
discussed the Kazakh initiative for creating a collective 
security system in Asia by concluding a treaty on coordination 
and trust-building measures on the continent. This initiative

the U.N. General Assembly in 1992. 
  The U.N. secretary general praised the initiatives moved by 
the Kazakh president. 
  Butrus-Ghali and Nazarbayev also discussed the current 
situation in Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Russia and the entire 
world. 
  After the meeting, the Kazakh president put his signature to 
the convention on child's rights. Kazakhstan became the 156th 
nation to join to this convention. 
  In conclusion of his staying at the U.N. headquarters, 
Nazarbayev met administrator of the United Nations Development 
Programme James Spet.
