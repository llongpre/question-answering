  [Text] New York (DPA) -- On Friday [25 March] UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali expressed the hope that Germany will make a 
greater contribution to the work of the United Nations. In a 
talk with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union group in the German 
Bundestag, he was, however, very restrained regarding any 
specific demands: Germany itself must decide what the greater 
German involvement in the United Nations should be like. 
  The United Nations has many and great needs, Butrus-Ghali 
said. Schaeuble pointed out that Germany has gone through 
considerable learning processes regarding its new international 
role since 1989 and has made considerable progress in this 
respect. 
  Butrus-Ghali stressed that in the United Nations the issue 
is 
not at all just blue helmet soldiers and peacekeeping -- this 
amounts to only 20 to 30 percent. More than half of the UN 
activities and also of his own work refer to social problems in 
the world, from environmental protection to development aid to 
population issues, the secretary general stressed. 
  The critical financial situation of the United Nations 
played 
a considerable role. Schaeuble stressed his readiness to 
advocate more intensively the interests of the international 
organization. However, as a parliamentarian and as the leader of 
the parliamentary majority, he can do this only if it is 
possible to define clearly the work of the United Nations and to 
make its success visible. 
  The financial means that were available for the Cold War, 
Butrus-Ghali complained, are in no proportion to those that are 
used to eliminate the relics of this period. Schaeuble assured 
the secretary general that Germany will certainly not leave him 
alone with his important task. 
  Before the talk with Butrus-Ghali Schaeuble had met with 
Russian UN Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsev. Both expressed the hope 
that the worst military conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are 
now over. However, Vorontsev expressed the fear that the 
negotiations about a peace settlement might take years. It has 
been shown that the United Nations cannot force anyone to accept 
a peaceful solution, Vorontsev said.
