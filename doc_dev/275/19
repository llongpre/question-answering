<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Sir David Frost; from the "Breakfast with Frost" program on 24 
April; Frost in studio, Butrus-Ghali in New York -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Frost] Earlier I spoke with the United Nations 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and I began by asking him 
whether the UN would authorize air strikes if the Serbs met some 
but not all of NATO's conditions. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This is a very technical question, I perceive 
that this had to be negotiated by the people who are on the 
ground. If they see that the violation is a real violation then 
we will use the air strikes without hesitation. 
  [Frost] If there is no response to the ultimatum, how does 
the coordination work. Can NATO then on the basis of your 
letter, and so on, can they just go ahead with air strikes, or 
do they have to get your approval? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] They have to get the approval of my special 
representative who is on the ground, because we have troops in a 
United Nations forces on the ground, and we must protect them. 
So the special representative in coordination or collaboration 
with the command of United Nations on the ground will decide 
where and when they have to use the air support. 
  [Frost] They will decide that? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. In other words you need the agreement of 
the two parties -- the NATO and the United Nations. 
  [Frost] Then what about when it comes, Mr. Secretary 
General, 
to the actual targets, do they have to be specifically agreed. 
I mean if one side wants to attack only encampments.... 
  [Butrus-Ghali] ...do you see, there is a perfect 
coordination 
between the military people of the NATO and the military people 
of the United Nations, they will coordinate and they will chose 
together what are the targets which ought to be bombed by the 
NATO air power. 
  [Frost] And what about when it comes time to stop. If either 
one, if either the UN or NATO want to stop, then the bombing 
stops? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, supposing that the United Nations say 
for 
the time being it will represent a danger for our soldiers or we 
are negotiating and let us postpone this air strike. They will 
coordinate with the NATO, and the NATO will postpone. 
  [Frost] Do you think secretary general, that in fact these 
air strikes could -- we've seen indications of this -- could 
these air strikes endanger in fact, either UN personnel or UN 
peacekeeping forces? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This is why we are coordinating and this is 
why we are insisting to obtain the agreement of the UN. This is 
the reason that we want to offer the maximum of protection to 
our United Nations staff, to our personnel working in the 
humanitarian assistance, and to the peacekeeping forces. 
  [Frost] There hasn't been progress in Bosnia, and of course 
the blame has been attached to the UN. Has it been a major blow 
to the UN the fact that there's been no progress? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly it is a blow to the image of the 
UN, but the expert who knows the reality knows quite well that 
the responsibility is shared between the UN and the major member 
states. The UN have no army, no money, so unless the member 
states will be ready to sustain the decision which had been 
adopted by the UN, i.e. by the member states, we will not be 
able to execute the different resolutions that have been 
adopted. So there is a very special relation between the UN and 
the member states. 
  [Frost] And in fact you're disappointed really at the number 
of troops made available? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This is another aspect -- we have, since June 
last year, been trying to obtain additional troops, and we have 
obtained a resolution from the Security Council, but we have not 
been able to obtain those additional troops. Because the air 
strikes have a value of dissuasion to reinforce the bargaining 
position of my mediators, but practically unless we have ground 
forces, our forces on the ground, it will be quite difficult to 
obtain a military result with air power only. 
  [Frost] So you were disappointed I presume, that when Friday 
[22 April], President Clinton reaffirmed that his troops would 
only be available after a peace. You need troops before a peace. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes I need troops before peace, but I was not 
disappointed, because I know quite well what are the positions 
of the United States, and the position of many other major 
members of the international community, who are ready to help 
the United Nations in different other activities, but not in 
participating in peacekeeping operations. 
  [Frost] In terms of the situation though, this action and 
the 
fact that you asked for this action at the beginning of the 
week, I suppose means that you've decided that as of now the 
Bosnian Serbs -- the target of these air strikes -- are the 
aggressors? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. The Bosnians are the aggressors, but you 
see you may have aggressors from the other side too. So the air 
strike will punish all those who are not respecting the 
resolutions adopted by the United Nations, or the last 
resolution which was adopted the NATO. 
  [Frost] And Mr. Akashi made a reference a few days ago to 
there being certain circumstances in which the UN might pull out 
of Bosnia. Are there any circumstances in which you might pull 
out of Bosnia? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly I will not advocate this. But this 
decision, if it will have to be taken, has to be taken by the 
Security Council. Because the troops are there according to a 
decision which was taken by the Security Council. If we want to 
pull out the troops, to diminish the number of the troops, this 
is a decision that will have to be taken by the Security 
Council. I'm in favor to maintain our presence, to continue to 
work on the ground until we will find a solution to this problem. 
  [Frost] Tell me something secretary general, looking back 
over the last two years or so, can you perceive from your unique 
position, was there somewhere where the international community, 
the nations of the world, the tactics went wrong? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes I believe that what is important [is] 
that 
during the last two years, that the member states still have not 
decided if they want to reinforce the United Nations or not. 
The member states have not decided if they want to give a role 
to the United Nations in peacekeeping operations, in solving 
international disputes, in reinforcing international 
cooperation. There is still [the fact that] the United Nations 
as such is not a priority for the majority of the member states. 
They have their bilateral diplomacy, they have their own 
defense, and the United Nations is an important instrument but 
it is still a marginal instrument. And this is one of the 
explanations why, during the last two years, we have not been 
able to cope with all the problems, because we have received 
demands every day from the 1,600 observers who are working now 
in South Africa, to control the elections, to the negotiations 
that are going on in Salvador, or in Guatemala, to the situation 
in Kigali, or in Bujumbura or in Mozambique, or in Angola.... 
  [Frost] So are you saying you think that while it's clear 
that the UN can succeed at peacekeeping, that in fact 
peacemaking is getting too difficult a task? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I will say that UN can succeed in 
peacekeeping 
and UN can even succeed in peacemaking or even in peace 
enforcement, on condition that we receive the necessary support 
from the member states. There are certain elements where 
certainly we failed, like what happened in Goradze is a failure 
for the United Nations, I will even say more, it is a 
humiliation for the United Nations, but this is one setback. 
You must see the other element of the other situation where we 
have been successful -- in Cambodia, in Salvador. 
  [Frost] Do you think there's any hope that the safe havens, 
so-called, will become safe in the future or will the phrase 
safe haven seem like a bitter joke? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No the safe haven is just a step toward the 
comprehensive solution of the problem of former Yugoslavia. The 
safe haven must be considered as just a step. We need to 
continue to negotiate, we need a global approach so that we will 
reach a comprehensive peace and a comprehensive just and lasting 
peace in former Yugoslavia. We must continue to negotiate, we 
must continue the dialogue until we find a peaceful solution. 
And until we move to a second step -- we have already appointed 
a coordinator in Sarajevo for the reconstruction, because this 
is the first step, once we agree then we have to build the 
peace, we have to do the reconstruction, the rehabilitation, the 
return of millions of refugees.
