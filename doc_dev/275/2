  [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- Negotiations of Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and United Nations 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, currently here on an 
official visit, were held today at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's residence to discuss peace-keeping operations of the 
United Nations and Russia. 
  "It was a specific business-like conversation and I am 
grateful to the United Nations secretary-general for it," the 
Russian foreign minister told a news conference here today. 
  The minister described Butrus-Ghali as a diplomat who heads 
the world's leading organization and a person who has made a 
colossal contribution to the solution of international problems, 
including settlement of armed conflicts around the globe. 
  In his turn, Butrus-Ghali said that Russia has played a most 
important diplomatic role on the world scene within the past few 
weeks. The Russian diplomacy helped to find a solution to the 
Sarajevo and Tuzla problem, which was an important contribution 
to peace-making efforts in former Yugoslavia. 
  The secretary-general expressed the hope that Russian-U.N. 
cooperation will bring peace to Georgia and Tajikistan and 
thanked Russia for the assistance to the consolidation of the 
U.N. role. 
  The meeting of Kozyrev and Butrus-Ghali lasted for over an 
hour.
