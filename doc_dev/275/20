<F P=106> [Report by Anatol Awcharenka] </F>
  [Excerpts] My visit to Minsk was extremely positive. This 
is how UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali assessed his 
meetings, negotiations, and talks [in Belarus], speaking at a 
conference with journalists at the National Press Center on 7 
April. In the course of a three-day visit, seven concrete 
issues were discussed at different levels with a Foreign 
Ministry delegation, at the Council of Ministers, and the 
Supreme Soviet. All of these issues are very important and 
urgent for Belarus, but the primary one is the problem stemming 
from the Chernobyl catastrophe. Mr. Butrus-Ghali arrived in our 
country to see what Chernobyl is, in reality. It is no secret 
that some countries are displaying weariness and losing interest 
in Chernobyl's problems. I am sure that the Belarusian side 
managed to provide the secretary general with convincing data 
contained in both the national report on Chernobyl and a special 
memorandum. These documents provide the most recent figures, 
the most current information. [passage omitted] 
  In the course of talks, both sides discussed measures to be 
taken to prevent the world community from reducing its 
involvement in alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl 
accident. However, as was underlined at a news conference held 
by Belarusian Foreign Minister Pyotr Krawchanka, it will be 
impossible to fully eliminate the aftermath of the accident in 
this century. 
  The Belarusian side can also consider the general 
secretary's 
visit a success because it was attended by the director of the 
Economic Commission for European Affairs. His participation in 
the negotiations was not coincidental. In my opinion, his 
arrival in Belarus demonstrated to our government that the 
United Nations is ready to help Belarus survive its transitional 
phase and integrate into the world, or at least the European 
economy. Mr. Butrus-Ghali suggested that our Republic take part 
in peacekeeping operations in various regions of the world. The 
general secretary said: We would be very grateful to you if 
Belarus could provide at least a small contingent of blue 
helmets. He was told that under current legislation, only the 
Supreme Soviet can decree Belarusian servicemen's participation 
in operations outside the Republic. If the situation were to 
change, we could assist the United Nations in keeping peace 
around the world. 
  The UN and Belarusian delegations also discussed the 
situation of Belarusian ethnic minorities in Latvia and Estonia. 
Mr. Butrus-Ghali treats this problem very seriously, and that 
is why the two sides agreed that the Laotian envoy, who is the 
UN Supreme Commissary, will come to Minsk and receive data on 
this complex problem, which is persistently plaguing us. The 
envoy will then visit the Baltic states to contribute to 
resolving the problem of national minorities, including 
Belarusians, in Latvia and Estonia. [passage omitted] 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has left for 
Geneva.
