  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- More intensive cooperation with the 
United Nations was the main issue for the beginning of UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's talks in Bonn. After his 
arrival on Tuesday [12 April], he first received FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Federal Government's guest house at 
Petersberg for a brief courtesy visit. 
  In a newspaper interview on Monday, Butrus-Ghali had said 
that he wants to advocate a German contribution to a permanent 
UN blue helmet task force of about 3,000 soldiers. By stating 
this, the UN secretary general, who expressly based his 
calculations on 1 percent of the strength of the national armed 
forces, seemed to expect a strength of only 300,000 men for the 
German Bundeswehr (currently 370,000 men). 
  As during his previous two working visits, the Federal 
Government will have to point out to Butrus-Ghali its hope that 
such decisions will become possible as a result of the ruling by 
the Federal Constitutional Court about armed alliance missions. 
The foreign minister expects such a ruling in summer 1994 at 
the earliest. Kinkel linked the issue with Germany's efforts for 
a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However, this seat 
is not issued by Butrus-Ghali but depends on a discussion of the 
United Nations. 
  The foreign minister urgently asked Butrus-Ghali for help 
with evacuating the 11 employees of Deutsche Welle in Rwanda. 
The United Nations, which has long had observers in the African 
country, has helicopters and other means of transportation, with 
which the Germans could be taken out of their isolated station. 
The UN secretary general promised to immediately examine that 
matter. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Kinkel also want to emphatically 
discuss with Butrus-Ghali an appropriate and representative 
settlement of UN organizations in Bonn. It was stressed in the 
Foreign Ministry that the promised transfer of the small UN 
information authority from Geneva does not fulfill this 
condition at all. 
  On Tuesday, Butrus-Ghali also met with Bundestag President 
Rita Suessmuth and had dinner with the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. The UN secretary general will attend the meeting on 
Wednesday as the guest of honor.
