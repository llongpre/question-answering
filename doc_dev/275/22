  [Text] Paris, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
criticized the United Nations' dismissal of French General Jean 
Cot as UN Yugoslav commander Friday [21 January], as UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on a private trip. 
  There was "apparently a problem because he is the fourth 
general who has been `worn out' in former Yugoslavia by the 
United Nations system," he said. "This system must be going 
wrong somewhere." 
  Cot's withdrawal, at Butrus-Ghali's request, follows that of 
French general Philippe Morillon and Belgian Francis Briquemont, 
who in various ways criticized the UN's apparent impotence in 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Juppe's comments were echoed by Defence Minister Francois 
Leotard who said there was "a crisis" at the UN, adding that 
France was planning to send the world body a memorandum 
demanding to "determine the conditions of employment of French 
forces" in Bosnia. 
  "If there is not a crisis between France and the UN, there 
is 
a crisis within the UN itself." 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived here late 
Friday for a two-day private visit but diplomatic sources said 
he could meet government officials during his stay. 
  Shortly after arriving from Amsterdam he met Georgian 
President Eduard Shevardnadze who was ending an official visit 
to France and who delayed his departure to meet the UN head.
