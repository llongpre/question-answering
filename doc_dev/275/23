<F P=106> [Report by Aleh Hruzdilovich: "Butrus-Ghali: `Chernobyl Is </F>
a Symbol of International Solidarity'"] 
  [Text] As expected, the second day of UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's visit to Belarus was devoted to Chernobyl issues. 
At any rate, Chernobyl problems prevailed during his meetings 
with Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb, Prime Minister 
Vyacheslaw Kebich, and Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Kenik who is 
also chairman of the State Committee for Dealing with the 
Aftermath of Chernobyl. They were also the focus during his 
visit to the radiation medicine clinic in Aksakawshchyna. Mr. 
Butrus-Ghali has received sufficient information to fully 
realize the scope of the Chernobyl catastrophe aftermath. 
During a meeting at the Supreme Soviet, he promised his 
personal support for keeping Chernobyl issues alive on the UN 
agenda. 
  The results of the two-day talks held by the UN secretary 
general in Minsk were assessed by Foreign Minister Pyotr 
Krawchanka as follows: "Mr. Butrus-Ghali fully supported our two 
Chernobyl projects. The first one, amounting to $12 million, 
concerns the carrying out of permanent radiation monitoring of 
the Republic. The second one, whose cost can be evaluated 
approximately at $8 million, concerns devising a project to 
build a plant manufacturing organic food for children. 
Butrus-Ghali indicated that the UN budget has no provision for 
financing these projects, and proposed looking for sponsors -- 
firms and various international funds, to which he promised all 
kinds of support." 
  Regarding other issues discussed during the talks, Pyotr 
Krawchanka informed that they were primarily devoted to 
relations between Belarus and the United Nations (great progress 
has been achieved in that area), as well as to the issue of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Our side confirmed its 
intent to fulfill the agreements on the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons, which were signed earlier for the period until 
1995, as well as the possibility of prolonging them for a new 
period, or giving them a set character. 
  The issue of Belarus' participation in various UN 
peacekeeping actions was also discussed. The Belarusian side 
highly estimated these international efforts and expressed its 
support in principle for activities leading to the suppression 
of existing conflicts. Regarding the direct participation of 
Belarus in such peacekeeping actions, it was stated that these 
issues are under the jurisdiction of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet. Concrete proposals from the United Nations to assist 
Belarus with disarmament were also discussed. 
  During the meeting of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali with 
Prime Minister Kebich, issues of economic cooperation of the 
Republic with the international community were discussed in 
detail along with the difficulties facing Belarus on the path 
toward reforms. Later in the day, Butrus-Ghali laid a wreath at 
the Peramoha monument and delivered a speech at the Belarusian 
Academy of Sciences. This afternoon, his visit is coming to a 
close, but on the eve of his departure a news conference should 
be held, after which we will be able to give our readers more 
details about the results of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's 
visit to Belarus.
