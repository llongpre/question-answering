  [Text] United Nations, Dec. 8 [as received] (YONHAP) -- UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will visit Seoul on Dec. 
22-24 and then travel to Pyongyang on an official visit, one of 
his aides said Wednesday. 
  Negotiations on the visit were proceeding well, Alvard de 
Soto, a political adviser to Butrus-Ghali, said. De Soto said 
Butrus-Ghali was going to Pyongyang at the invitation of North 
Korea, which is a UN member. He denied the possibility of the 
UN leader playing as a mediator in talks over the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The nuclear issue is being dealt with in talks between North 
Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency and between 
North Korea and the United States, and should be handled by the 
Security Council but not by the secretary-general, de Soto said. 
  He, however, suggested the possibility of Butrus-Ghali 
playing a certain role in the resolution process in his personal 
capacity and said the nuclear issue is on the agenda of his 
meeting with North Korean leaders. 
  A highly-placed official on the South Korean Mission to the 
United Nations said it was unlikely Butrus-Ghali would mediate 
in the North Korean nuclear issue because it is being dealt with 
in negotiations between the parties concerned. North Korea, 
which is demanding direct talks with the United States, will not 
want him to play such a role, he added. 
  The secretary-general will convey to North Korean leaders 
the 
international community's position and mood on the nuclear 
issue, including resolutions by the UN Security Council and 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the official said. 
  His visit to Pyongyang when diplomatic efforts to settle the 
North Korean nuclear issue have made little progress and the 
imposition of UN sanctions appears imminent opens the 
possibility he will act as a go-between. 
  A UN source, noting that the U.S.-North Korea talks are at a 
level below vice minister, said there is a possibility the U.S. 
Government will use the visit to convey a message to Kim Il-song. 
  Butrus-Ghali said in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy 
last month that Kim Il-song had rejected his request for a 
visit, suggesting that he planned to visit Pyongyang some time 
ago. 
  Butrus-Ghali will be the first UN leader to visit Pyongyang 
in 14 years and the first ever to visit Seoul. Kurt Waldheim 
made a brief stop in Pyongyang in 1979.
