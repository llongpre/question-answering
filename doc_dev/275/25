<F P=106> [Studio interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali and with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by "Itogi" 
program announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev; in English with superimposed 
Russian translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kiselev] It is a well known fact that in its 
aspiration to play a key role in resolving the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict, Russia has long been exerting diplomatic efforts with 
the aim of gaining the status of peacekeeping forces for the 
Russian Federation troops in that region. Issues relating to 
the peacekeeping operations, in which, on the one hand, Russia 
and, on the other, the United Nations are involved, were the 
main subject of the negotiations in Moscow between Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
Our interview with them focused on this very topic. 
  Mr. secretary general, as everyone knows, the UN 
peacekeeping 
forces must not include servicemen from countries which are in 
one way or another involved in the conflict or whose territories 
neighbor on the conflict. Russia would today wish, on the one 
hand, to widen the UN participation in peacekeeping operations 
in the post-Soviet space, but on the other hand, it does not 
want to refuse to get involved itself in resolving conflicts 
near its borders, nor, indeed, can it refuse to do so. A very 
contradictory situation is thus created. Where do you see the 
way out of this, if there is one? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Of course there is a way out. Take former 
Yugoslavia, for instance. The United Nations, the European 
Community and, finally, NATO are all taking part in the efforts 
to establish peace in this region. I see no obstacles to 
Russian forces taking part in peacekeeping operations on the 
territory of the former USSR under the Russian Federation flag. 
But at the same time, independent peacekeeping operations would 
be taking place there in close cooperation with Russia, 
involving UN observers, for example. This sort of approach has 
not been adopted previously. 
  Previously, for the United Nations, it was an indispensable 
condition that the entire command of any peacekeeping operation 
remain in UN hands. However, now we do not have enough forces 
for everything. Only recently, the United Nations never had 
more than two or three peacekeeping operations on the go at the 
same time. Today 17 such operations are being condutcted around 
the globe at the same time. The annual budget of the UN 
peacekeeping forces was at one time $500-600 million, whereas 
now it is up to $3.6 billion per year. In this situation, we 
cannot do without additional assistance from the UN member 
countries, and also from various regional organizations. 
  [Kiselev] Nevertheless, if I understood you correctly, you 
rule out the possibility of Russian Federation troops operating 
under the UN flag in the capacity of peacekeeping forces in the 
Transcaucasus or in Tajikistan, for example. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, it is impossible because the United 
Nations Organization can carry out a peacekeeping operation only 
from the very start, the same way a surgeon will not agree to 
operate on a patient starting mid-way. But if you have already 
started an independent peace-making operation, the United 
Nations Organization can give you assistance and work side by 
side with you. There is another option which is to include 
Russian troops in a broader international peacekeeping 
contingent, under UN command, though. 
  [Kiselev] What countries can send their servicemen to 
participate in such a contingent, for instance, in Georgia, 
Abkhazia, or Tajikistan? Is it at all feasible to form such a 
contingent? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is feasible if a relevant agreement is 
attained and if the UN Security Council is convinced that this 
is necessary, because all this has to be paid for but the 
Security Council is not always willing to do this. Many of its 
members are disappointed by the fact that not all recent UN 
peacekeeping operations have been successful, such as Somalia 
and former Yugoslavia. So I repeat, Security Council members 
have yet to be convinced, talks with them are needed. At the 
same time, there are conditions stipulating an international 
nature of the peacekeeping contingent, that is, Russian 
servicemen will account for no more than 20-30 percent of its 
total number while the remaining 70 percent will be made up of 
servicemen from five or six other countries. Only in this case 
will the United Nations defray the cost of the operation and, 
again, on the condition of retaining the political leadership of 
the operation. 
  [Kiselev] So you discussed all the above with our Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, we did. 
  [Kiselev] And what was the result: sharp disagreements or 
mutual understanding? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, on the contrary, I hope that an accord 
will be attained within the next few days, and on its basis we 
will later discuss at the Security Council the issue of 
dispatching UN peacekeeping forces or UN observers to the areas 
of conflict in the former USSR. 
  [Kiselev] But you must agree that UN observers and 
peacekeeping forces are not the same. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] You are right. However, if we do not get the 
Security Council's consent to dispatching peacekeeping forces we 
will still be able to obtain a mandate to dispatch observers. 
  [Interview cuts to Foreign Minister Kozyrev without 
introduction or question from Kiselev] 
  [Kozyrev] Yes indeed, the role of observers is slightly 
different. They are not troops. Therefore, they are taking 
part. But this is useful. We would indeed like our contingent 
to be granted the status of a UN contingent. Incidentally, this 
option is being discussed. We are proposing this option for 
Karabakh, and also for Abkhazia. But the problem once again is 
this: if our contingent officially becomes a UN contingent, ie 
if our servicemen literally don blue helmets, then the United 
Nations has to pay for this in full. But unfortunately this is 
what they do not want to do. Moreover, the United Nations has 
to share with us political responsibility for these efforts. 
Here again, as I have already mentioned, there is a budget 
deficit, and there is also what I would call a deficit of 
political courage and will. But the secretary general cannot 
solve this question on his own. This question has to be solved 
by the UN Security Council. Hence this question is not in the 
hands of the secretary general, but in the hands of, above all, 
permanent members and also other member states of the Security 
Council. 
  Another aspect that we often forget is that the United 
Nations operates on precedents. If the United Nations directly 
agrees to involvement by a neighboring state in some conflicts 
directly on its behalf -- I mean on behalf of the United Nations 
-- one can imagine that in other conflicts, in other regions, 
some other states would demand a similar mandate from the United 
Nations. And here certain difficulties may arise. I will not 
give any examples, but one can easily imagine this. Moreover, 
it may well be that we ourselves will be very much concerned if 
a particular neighboring state starts conducting operations in 
its neighboring state under the UN flag, as it were. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Security Council members' hesitations are not 
just about you -- though I know that people in Russia do think 
that the United Nations does not want to embark on peacekeeping 
operations particularly in your case, on the territory of the 
former [Soviet] Union. But this is not so. For example, we 
would undoubtedly like to send 600 blue helmets to Mozambique. 
We have been discussing it for six months, but not one of UN 
member states shows any willingness to designate its servicemen 
to be part of this contingent. So I have to go to various 
capitals as a petitioner: please do send you soldiers to 
Mozambique. But after all, UN members have to bear 
responsibility to each other. Suppose tomorrow the United 
Nations asks Russia to send 2,000 Russian servicemen to Angola. 
Public opinion in your country will certainly start buzzing: 
why should we send 2,000 of our soldiers to Angola? Why Angola? 
Where is this Angola anyway? Why should my son risk his life 
in Angola? Preparing public opinion is a huge problem. Say, if 
you want Argentina or Chile --two weeks ago there was 
negotiation about the possibility of those two countries 
allocating some of their servicemen to be sent to Tajikistan in 
the future. So you have to be prepared, in turn, to send your 
servicemen, say, to Angola, however unpopular this measure might 
be. One of my tasks is precisely this. I am telling Russia: I 
know that you have many internal problems at home, but don't 
forget about the United Nations.
