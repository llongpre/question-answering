  [Text] United Nations, April 26 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
will not hesitate in calling air strikes if Bosnian Serbs do not 
remove all heavy artillery within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of 
Gorazde, U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said Tuesday 
in Barbados. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has 
threatened to bomb Serb positions if the equipment is not 
withdrawn from around the Moslem enclave by 0001 GMT Wednesday. 
"If they don't withdraw, then we will use air strikes against 
them without any hesitation," he said in a press conference in 
Barbados broadcast at the United Nations. 
  NATO and the United Nations have several times threatened 
air 
raids to protect Bosnian Moslems in UN-declared safe areas but 
never actually carried them out except for two strikes two weeks 
ago to protect UN peacekeepers. 
  "I am hoping that the Serbs will comply with the different 
resolutions which have been adopted by the UN and that they will 
leave Gorazde and that we will not be compelled to use air 
strikes," he said. 
  UN forces in the former Yugoslavia have said that the heavy 
weapons are being withdrawn as the deadline approaches. 
  The secretary general has been in the Caribbean island of 
Barbados since the weekend to open a world conference for 
sustainable development for small states.
