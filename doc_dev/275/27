  [Text] Moscow 4 April, TASS -- President Yeltsin received 
U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in the Kremlin today. 
They had a constructive and businesslike discussion of a wide 
range of problems dealing with world politics, and tasks in the 
sphere of consolidating world security. 
  Butrus-Ghali told Yeltsin about the steps taken for the 
purpose of making the work of the U.N. more quick and efficient. 
The Russian side supported the strengthening of the U.N. and 
the taking of measures for improving its work, so that it will 
be able to tackle topical problems of the 21st century. Yeltsin 
stressed Russia's interest in cooperation with the U.N. in 
connection with the advance of the Russian reform. The U.N. 
secretary-general said this was in line with his intentions and 
actions. 
  They discussed in detail problems of peace-keeping 
activities 
and humanitarian diplomacy. The sides were unanimous in their 
opinion that those spheres of the U.N. activities, which are 
becoming central in world politics, should be given greater 
attention and considerable resources. 
  Special attention was devoted to conflict situations on the 
CIS territory and the observance of human rights in the former 
USSR republics. Yeltsin stressed Russia's openness to 
cooperation with the U.N. for purposes of ensuring peace in the 
hotbeds of tension, situated on the CIS territory. Butrus-Ghali 
praised Russia's peace-keeping role and reiterated the U.N. 
intention to actively promote the attaining of a durable 
political solution to the crises, specifically in Georgia and 
Tajikistan. 
  Butrus-Ghali asked President Yeltsin to attend a summit 
meeting on social problems, due to take place in March 1995, and 
to address the U.N. General Assembly within the framework of 
preparations for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations 
Organisation. The invitations were accepted, ITAR-TASS learned 
from the press service of the Russian president.
