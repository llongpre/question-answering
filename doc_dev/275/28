  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has reemphasized that he 
accepts the principles of the package of confidence-building 
measures proposed by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
and is ready to begin talks on ways to implement the measures as 
soon as the Turkish Cypriot side states the same clear and 
unconditional acceptance. Since the Turkish side has not 
accepted the package and seven months have been lost, the 
president proposes that the secretary general have the two sides 
return to a discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue, 
beginning with their concerns about security issues, until the 
Turkish side decides on the confidence-building measures. 
Kliridhis' positions are outlined in his letter to the 
secretary general the text of which was made public today in 
Nicosia. 
  In his seven-page letter, the president reiterates his 
position that he accepts the package of confidence-building 
measures as proposed by Butrus-Ghali, that is, the whole 
fenced-off area of Famagusta coming under UN administration and 
the Nicosia International Airport reopening under United 
Nations' control. The president stresses that Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas has not replied in a straightforward way on 
whether he accepts the agreement proposed by Butrus-Ghali. 
After wasting seven months since June, when the talks were 
suspended because of his stance, the Turkish Cypriot leader's 
own letter to the secretary general raises several issues 
outside the framework of the principles set out by the UN 
secretary general. 
  Kliridhis writes various notes on particular issues raised 
by 
Denktas and submits three questions, stressing that he expects 
clear answers to these questions: First, whether Denktas 
accepts, irrespective of his so-called concerns about security 
issues, that the whole fenced-off area of Famagusta be turned 
over to the United Nations to administer and police and that the 
Greek Cypriot residents will return to their homes and 
properties. Second, whether Denktas abandons any notion of the 
Greek Cypriot side recognizing, either directly or indirectly, 
through any practical measures, legal status for the occupied 
ports and the airport in the north. Third, whether Denktas 
accepts that any confidence-building measures agreed upon must 
be implemented without waiting to see if they are in line with 
an overall and complete Cyprus solution. 
  The president continues: On Denktas' concerns about security 
issues raised in his letter to Your Excellency, both regarding 
the final solution and the confidence-building measures, I wish 
to highlight that the Greek Cypriot side also has serious 
concerns about security issues. Since both sides, the president 
adds in his letter, admit that they have serious concerns about 
security, obviously, we must discuss and resolve this issue 
before any other, instead of finding it in front of us every 
time we reach a step toward progress. If Denktas is ready to 
discuss both sides' concerns about security, I am ready to 
participate, the president concludes.
