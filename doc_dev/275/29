<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Has Units Ready for UN </F>
Duties"] 
  [Text] New York, 22 June -- The Netherlands has offered 
units from all sections of its Armed Forces to the United 
Nations. These units could carry out duties anywhere in the 
world with a one to four weeks' notice. 
  Defense Minister Ter Beek announced this yesterday at the UN 
headquarters after long talks with Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  A total of 3,500 military are involved in these forces, 
which 
include two frigates, two minesweepers and a support ship, a 
battalion of marines, and a Navy PC3 Orion reconnaissance 
aircraft. The Land Forces involved include an infantry battalion 
with armored vehicles, a command unit, and an engineering 
company for mine clearance and road repair. The Air Force would 
be able to supply a squadron of 18 F-16 fighter aircraft and two 
F-27 transport planes. Fifty military policemen could be 
deployed for police tasks. 
  Ter Beek said the units would fit in a UN organizational 
system enabling the secretary general to know at a glance what 
troops were available in the world, how long it would take for 
them to arrive, their specialities, and equipment. The 
Netherlands is the 18th country to follow Butrus-Ghali's call 
for a pool of military personnel for peacekeeping duties. 
  Ter Beek explained that the units could only be deployed if 
the Netherlands' Cabinet gave its approval to the UN mission and 
after the Netherlands' Parliament had been consulted. In 
addition to these units on standby for UN tasks, the Netherlands 
would also supply other troops and material for implementing UN 
peacekeeping duties at any time. 
  During his talks with Butrus-Ghali, Ter Beek repeated that 
the Netherlands did not want to send any troops to Rwanda. Ter 
Beek said that Butrus-Ghali showed understanding for the 
Netherlands' position that Netherlands soldiers looked too much 
like the Belgians, the former colonial power, and therefore 
would run extra risks. But the Netherlands would supply a 
transport plane to fly freight and military personnel for air 
traffic control into Rwanda's neighboring countries. 
  Butrus-Ghali praised the Netherlands' military efforts in 
Bosnia and Croatia. He was happy with the cabinet's intention 
to relieve the troops in Bosnia on 1 July with the 12th 
Battalion of the Airborne Brigade. "A purple coalition will not 
change this," Ter Beek said. 
  During the talks the secretary general declared that he was 
having great difficulty in carrying out UN peacekeeping duties. 
Sometimes there are not enough soldiers, often they have 
inadequate equipment, and if they are offered equipment from 
another member state then they first have to be trained in its 
use. This way precious months can be lost and the United 
Nations is unable to implement the peacekeeping decisions made 
by the Security Council. 
  He said he was very happy with the Netherlands' initiative 
to 
make a number of units permanently available. "If that could be 
done on a wider scale, Butrus-Ghali could decide quicker which 
soldiers were to be sent out, because finally he knows what he 
has in store," Ter Beek added.
