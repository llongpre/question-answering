  [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- United Nations Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told a news conference upon the 
completion of his meeting with Andrey Kozyrev here today he is 
optimistic about a possibility of U.N.-Russian cooperation in 
peace-making around the globe, including Georgia and Tajikistan. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about the Russian peace-making role in 
former Soviet republics and a possibility of these efforts' 
integration with the United Nations global peace-making 
operations, Butrus-Ghali said this was discussed with the 
Russian foreign minister. 
  In his words, the U.N. secretariat is very interested in 
cooperation with Russia and its participation in peace-making 
contingents in various areas. At the same time, a resolution of 
the United Nations Security Council to the effect is necessary, 
which will entail certain financial difficulties. 
  The U.N. peace-making budget has increased from 500 million 
dollars to 3.6 billions within two years, and this is an 
obstacle to be overcome in order to expand cooperation with 
Russia in this sphere, said Butrus-Ghali.
