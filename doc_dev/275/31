  [Excerpts] Lebanon has complained to the Security Council 
about Israel's abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani. The complaint 
was submitted as Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was meeting UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York. Peres said 
Yasir 'Arafat has to make clear his commitment to all elements 
of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] and express opposition to 
the use of violence in relations with Israel. From New York, 
Judy Lessing reports: 
  [Begin Lessing recording] Foreign Minister Peres told Mr. 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali about Israel's relations with Lebanon, 
Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians, and he said a high priority 
is the building of the new Middle East. He said it is Israel 
which must make the tangible concessions, and Israelis need to 
know there is a new Middle East. 
  The secretary general assured Mr. Peres the United Nations 
has a sincere interest in the peace process in the region, and 
he has offered UN help to promote it, though he did not give 
many specifics. He did talk about the possibility of setting up 
some kind of apparatus to oversee UN agencies, the World Bank, 
and the International Monetary Fund, as the funds promised for 
the Palestinian self-ruling authority are made available. 
  Foreign Minister Peres says that Israel is pleased its 
relations with the United Nations are improving, but he said he 
would like to see more progress, and he told the secretary 
general Israel wants to become a normal, full participant in the 
United Nations. For example, he said, Israel is willing to 
contribute to peacekeeping operations, and though the government 
would have to approve any contribution of forces to say, Angola, 
this could be a possibility. At a time when the United Nations 
is having serious problems getting skilled troops for its 
operations, this should have been a welcome suggestion. 
  It is almost certain the question of where Ron Arad is was 
discussed when Mr. Peres and Mr. Butrus-Ghali had a private 
meeting before their aides joined them. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  Addressing the Israel Policy Forum, Foreign Minister Peres 
said that with peace in the Middle East, the threat of nuclear 
weapons will be eradicated. 
  [Begin Peres recording] We shall have a Middle East free of 
the danger of war. We shall also, I hope so, have a Middle East 
free of the danger of the nuclear threat. But it must be in 
this order. You cannot build a second floor before you have the 
first one. When the Egyptians in particular are demanding that 
Israel will sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] and 
so on, we are asking them privately: Gentlemen, are you going 
to guarantee that Iran is okay, Iraq is okay, Libya is okay? 
What are you talking about? You cannot have it done partially. 
Their nuclearization is invisible. Otherwise it does not 
exist. If we shall have a different Middle East, we shall have 
a different policy concerning the nonconventional arms. [end 
recording]
