  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will submit 
his report to the UN Security Council on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] in 10 days. This period will be used as a new 
silent deadline for the Turkish side to accept the CBM's. 
  According to information from the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation correspondent in New York, the reason for the new 
deadline is the secretary general's heavy work schedule. In 
reality, though, the new deadline is due to the weakness of the 
Security Council permanent members to agree on a common line. 
The silent deadline was decided by the ambassadors of the five 
UN Security Council members in Nicosia. Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, agrees 
with this decision in principle but appears dissatisfied, mainly 
about the tolerant stance that the United States is showing 
toward Turkey. Clark links the renewal of his contract with the 
outcome of the efforts at the end of the 10-day deadline. 
  A UN official said he hopes the CBM's will be accepted while 
the report is being written, otherwise the UN secretary general 
will proceed based on UN Resolution 889. 
  Clark met Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, in San Francisco last night and 
discussed ways to utilize the 10-day deadline as well as what 
must be done if nothing happens by the end of the deadline. 
  A UN statement said that Clark and Butrus-Ghali discussed 
the 
preparation of the report and the future direction of UN 
efforts. A UN source in New York said that despite the failure 
of the latest efforts of the UN envoys, the United Nations will 
not abandon its efforts to implement the CBM's. The same source 
said it is almost impossible for the United Nations to wash its 
hands of a problem to which it has devoted so much time and 
energy.
