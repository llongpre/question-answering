<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the Paris studio -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] The United Nations is taking a lot of flak right 
now. You will have heard what [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur 
and [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe have said: If things continue 
like this in Bosnia, we shall withdraw our peacekeeping troops. 
What do you think about this? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I think that any peacekeeping operation must 
be of limited duration, and that we must encourage the 
protagonists in the conflict to find a peaceful solution as 
quickly as possible, because there is fatigue on the part of the 
member states, on both the military front and the financial 
front. 
  [Giesbert] What will happen if France puts its threat into 
action? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is for the Security Council to decide what 
we must look at, to which troops we should turn to replace the 
troops that wish to leave. A similar operation was conducted in 
Somalia, where the French, American, German, and Belgian troops 
withdrew, and we were able to continue the operation with 
African and Asian troops. 
  [Giesbert] You saw Francois Mitterrand yesterday, as well as 
Edouard Balladur. Did they tackle you about it? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, on the contrary; I received support from 
both the prime minister and the president for the action the 
United Nations is taking worldwide, whether in Angola, 
Mozambique, Rwanda, Burundi -- more or less throughout the world. 
  [Giesbert] But in order to make progress in this matter of 
Bosnia, should one not in fact send more peacekeeping troops? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, but if the states do not wish to do 
this, 
then we are dealing with an established fact. We have to try to 
continue with our action with the number of peacekeeping troops 
at our disposal at the moment. 
  [Giesbert] With regard to your action in Bosnia, when you 
are 
accused, as happens often, of playing the Serbian card, how do 
you answer this? You have a representative there who is very 
fond of the Serbs. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, not at all. We are neutral, we represent 
the international community. Our presence there is made up of 
French troops, British troops, Egyptian troops, Jordanian 
troops. You have an international group, it is a multinational 
force, and the decisions which are adopted are not decisions 
adopted by one or two states. They are adopted by 15 states, 
including the five big powers. So, we cannot be accused of 
subjectivity in so far as we are implementing decisions which 
are adopted by the international community. 
  [Giesbert] You are not being accused of subjectivity, Mr. 
Secretary General, but your representative there is accused of 
subjectivity. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, it is not true. The representative who is 
on the spot is applying the recommendations and the resolutions 
which are adopted by the member states of the United Nations, 
and it is a normal thing that the various protagonists are going 
to accuse us of subjectivity when this or that action is not in 
keeping with their particular objectives. 
  [Giesbert] The Bosnians are howling. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The Bosnians are howling, the Serbs are 
howling, the Croats are howling, and we have had problems with 
all three protagonists at different moments. 
  [Giesbert] What about the basic question raised by the 
Bosnia 
problem, because you are accused of many things, but in the 
final analysis, you do not have the necessary means? Does this 
not raise the question of this real army which the United 
Nations ought to have, a real army which would be capable of 
making war? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I agree, but this real army depends on the 
willingness of the member states. The United Nations does not 
have an army, arms, or the financial resources to be able to 
act, if the member states do not decide that this should be the 
case. 
  [Giesbert] And what do the member states say? They say if we 
cannot do that, it is because of the United Nations. In other 
words, you are being used as a scapegoat. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, certainly the United Nations is often 
used as a scapegoat, but I believe everyone knows very well 
that, in the final analysis, when a resolution which demands 
10,000 men is adopted by the Security Council and we are unable 
to obtain the 10,000 men, this is not the fault of the UN 
Secretariat. It is due to the fact that the member countries do 
not wish to put the 10,000 men demanded by the Security Council 
resolution at the UN Secretariat's disposal. Or, alternatively, 
if members of the United Nations, after having put certain 
forces at UN disposal, decide to withdraw these forces, then I 
have no means of preventing these members from withdrawing their 
forces. 
  [Giesbert] You, the secretary general, the United Nations, 
are insulted all the time. There are even French ministers who 
say it is this, it is that. There is talk of impotence, 
cowardice -- do you have the impression that you are being 
supported in your action? For example, do the states willingly 
help the United Nations -- in all ways, I am not just talking 
about financially? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, no, no, the financial problem is another 
aspect of the problem. States do not pay their contribution. 
The United States owes us more than a billion dollars, so we 
have financial difficulties. 
  [Giesbert] Are you saying that it is in fact the Third World 
that pays the United Nations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] To a certain extent it is the Third World 
which sends the troops, but obviously the logistics, the means 
of transporting these troops, the arms required for these 
troops, the means of communication, are those of the big states. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Secretary General, let us talk about Rwanda 
now. There is a dual genocide taking place there, and all that 
you are doing at the United Nations in the end is to reduce the 
contingent. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, we are not reducing the contingent. Here 
again we are talking about a decision by the Security Council. 
I gave a report to the Security Council... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] In other words, it is not you? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] On the contrary. [sentence as heard] I asked 
the Security Council to replace immediately...[pauses] To give 
you an example, the Belgian troops withdrew, and they have the 
right to withdraw, because the contribution is a voluntary one. 
I read a report to the Security Council, calling on it as a 
first option to replace the Belgian troops immediately by other 
troops. 
  [Giesbert] In other words, you are the UN Secretariat 
General. In other words, it does not care about anyone else. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, the member states made a choice, but if 
the United Nations is to be used as a black sheep and this helps 
the member nations, then highlighted whereas the successful 
operations are generally overlooked] 
  [Giesbert] You still have a lot of work on your plate. For 
example, as an Arab, are you not afraid of what is going to 
happen in Algeria? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, at present Algeria is a matter of an 
internal conflict. But if the Algerian Government should ever 
ask for our assistance, then we are ready to give it -- just 
like any other country, just as the Georgian Government asked 
for our help. We have observers on the spot helping to find a 
solution to the conflict between the Georgians and the 
Abkhazians. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Secretary General. I wish you 
success and a good day. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Thank you.
