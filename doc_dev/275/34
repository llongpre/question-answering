  [Text] Answering questions about his opinion on the latest 
UN secretary general's report, Archbishop Khrisostomos said: "We 
are not at all satisfied with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's report. The attribution of some vague 
responsibility to the Turkish side is ruined by the alternative 
procedures that are suggested." 
  Among other things, the archbishop said in his statement: 
"Who is Butrus-Ghali to threaten with his reference to the 
withdrawal of the UN international peacekeeping force that is 
stationed in Cyprus? Certainly not the Turkish side..... It is 
a threat to us, who will essentially remain exposed to the mercy 
of the fully armed Turkish troops and settlers." 
  "...the UN secretary general's report makes no reference to 
the need to put an end to the invasion and occupation or that 
the Turkish troops and settlers must withdraw. It also makes no 
reference to the basic UN resolutions." 
  The Archbishop suggests that: 

  -  The political leadership 
make united demands that the national issue return to its 
basis--that is, the invasion, occupation, and violation of human 
rights. We are all obliged to appeal to the United Nations, 
without hesitation or disagreement, and insist firmly that the 
basic UN resolutions be implemented. 
  -  We appeal to the powers 
guaranteeing Cyprus' independence--Great Britain and Greece--and 
demand that they fulfill their responsibilities and commitments 
stemming from the treaty that guarantees Cyprus' independence.
