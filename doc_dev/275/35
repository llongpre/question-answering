  [Editorial Report] Greek-language Nicosia dailies on 
Thursday, 10 March comment on UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's latest report on the progress of the proximity 
talks on the confidence-building measures being held by Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative in Nicosia. 
  Right-wing I MAKHI carries a 350-word editorial on page 16 
entitled: "Unacceptable Document!" The paper says: "The UN 
secretary general's latest report on the new phase of the Cyprus 
issue has caused strong discontent in Nicosia." On the one 
hand, in his report the secretary general tries to stress the 
dangers and on the other hand, he tries to make the famous 
confidence-building measures look better, by presenting them as 
a panacea! The Butrus- Ghali report is not only reserved for 
making the confidence-building measures look better. From any 
other side, it is also disappointing and unacceptable for the 
Greek Cypriot side because Butrus-Ghali himself abolishes the 
four principles that he had set down in his previous report. 
Now, he wants to present UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] as 
supra-government and supra-authority, but at the same time he 
demands that the Republic of Cyprus cede some of its powers and 
authority. 
  And not only this! He also demands that the legal government 
recognize the pseudostate's "documents" so that the Turkish 
Cypriots can travel freely anywhere in the world. At the same 
time, he wants the area of Nicosia Airport and the fenced area 
of Famagusta to actually become a "state" of the United Nations. 
The writer goes on to say that if this UN proposal is accepted, 
in Cyprus there will be the most unusual phenomenon with part of 
the island under the control of Greek Cypriots, another part 
under the Turkish Cypriots, another part under the British, and 
finally a fourth part under UN control. The writer concludes 
with the following: "With such unacceptable views and 
philosophies, there will be no solution to the Cyprus issue in 
the foreseeable future. And since the UN secretary general and 
the other foreigners behind him have now revealed the most 
miserable plan against Cyprus, we should make our own decisions. 
The measures by Butrus-Ghali, the British, and Americans belong 
in the trash can! The National Council should, at last, make its 
own decisions." 
  ELEVTHEROTIPIA, mouthpiece of the Democratic Party, which 
shares power with President Glavkos Kliridhis' former party, the 
Democratic Rally, comments on the secretary general's report in 
the 200-word "Freely" column entitled "The Butrus-Ghali Report," 
on page one. The writer says: "The first conclusion one draws 
after a careful study of the UN secretary general's report to 
the Security Council, is that we are drawn to even deeper seas 
and, at the same time, we move further away from the substance 
of the Cyprus issue and the principles of international law and 
the United Nations which should govern a just and lasting 
solution of our issue." The writer then says that the UN 
Secretariat actions are outside the norm and thus create new 
faits accomplis, and adds: "We think that we should tell 
Butrus-Ghali certain things clearly. We should register our 
disagreement in a straightforward way, and with dignity and 
credibility demand justice. Neither Butrus-Ghali nor anyone 
else should be allowed to form the impression that we are 
willing to be brought back and forth and be dragged into 
arrangements that do not take into account the justice of our 
case." 
  KHARAVYI, mouthpiece of communist party AKEL [Restorative 
Party of the Working People] comments on the report in a 
150-word column entitled "The Butrus-Ghali Report," under the 
general banner "Aggressively" on page five. The writer says: 
"The UN secretary general's first report on the proximity talks 
for the confidence-building measures has brought confusion to 
the government, which has avoided commenting on it. The ideas 
for promotion of the proximity talks appear to be based on the 
UN experts' reports [on implementation of the 
confidence-building measures] which the government did not want 
to accept at the negotiating table. Naturally, with the 
Butrus-Ghali report it is evident that the fenced area of 
Famagusta and Nicosia Airport will be under UN administration. 
This means that beyond the occupation and sovereignty of the 
British bases, we will now have the sovereignty of the United 
Nations, albeit temporary, in two parts of our homeland. Of 
course, the danger of indirect recognition of the pseudostate is 
present, since we also have the demand to allow the Turkish 
Cypriots to travel freely abroad." The writer says that it 
appears rather difficult for President Kliridhis to be able to 
overturn the developments, as the secretary general's report is 
very strict, and concludes: "The government reaps what it has 
sown." 
  Independent O AGON carries a 450-word comment in the 
"Opinion" column by the "Observer" on page three, entitled "The 
Republic of Cyprus Is Being Abolished." The writer beings by 
asking: "Why are we shocked and surprised by the contents and 
approach of the UN secretary general regarding the way the 
confidence-building measures will be implemented and by the 
status that will result from the implementation of the relevant 
arrangements? Butrus-Ghali has said nothing more upsetting than 
what was `pictured' in his documents for the confidence-building 
measures. He also does not present any other reality than what 
was expressed by the UN experts in their reports." The writer 
says that the secretary general has already told us how things 
will be, and explains: "Famagusta will be a new, worse Pyla, 
captive of the Turkish Army. Nicosia Airport will be the 
entrance to the recognition of the pseudostate. The sovereignty 
of the Republic of Cyprus will be canceled. The sovereignty of 
two administrators, one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot, 
will take its place. Famagusta will be under double 
sovereignty, that is, Greek-Turkish sovereignty." The writer 
says the same will happen with Nicosia Airport and, "the first 
step toward abolition of the Republic of Cyprus is a fact." The 
writer argues further why the UN proposals will abolish the 
Republic of Cyprus, and concludes with the following: "We are 
only a small step from the abyss. The step will be made if we 
accept the measures."
