<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Sa'id Sunbul in New York on 20 April] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sunbul] To be honest with 
you, the public in the Arab and Islamic worlds in particular was 
under the impression that the UN secretary general would play a 
more effective role in ending the war in Bosnia. However, the 
war there rages on. It has not ended despite the passage of two 
years. What are the reasons? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I would like to clarify one important fact 
which many might have missed. This fact is that I, in my 
capacity as UN secretary general, do not command a combat army 
that I can use to intervene and end all wars raging around the 
world. I also do not have the power to impose peace on a 
conflict between two countries. What I can do is intervene to 
end wars and conflicts and convince the warring parties to stop 
their wars and accept peace. 
  I am sad and sorry about what is happening in Bosnia. I have 
done all I can in the past two years to defend the Bosnian 
people and protect them from Serbian aggression. However, the 
issue is not in my hands as much as it is in the hands of the 
member countries, in particular the big powers. 
  Over the past two years, I have not stopped my contacts with 
the various countries to recruit more forces to send to Bosnia 
to protect the people there. I have also visited many donor 
countries in an attempt to convince them to provide more aid to 
the international forces in Bosnia. The mission of these forces 
is to protect the Bosnian people. 
  In June last year, I asked the countries to increase the 
number of international forces in Bosnia. However, they did not 
respond to my request. I am still making this demand. 
  The United Nations might realize some successes in some 
areas 
and failures in others. This success or failure does not depend 
on the United Nations itself as an organ, but on the member 
countries, and in particular the countries influential in 
decisionmaking. The United Nations is merely a mirror 
reflecting the stand of its member countries. 
  To this fact, we must add another fact, which is that the 
United Nations is made up of 184 members representing various 
economic, political, and geographic groupings. Despite this 
fact, decisionmaking within this international organization 
continues to be restricted to a very limited sphere. The 
remaining member countries, with all their potentials and 
resources put together, were not able to influence this sphere 
or infiltrate it. This, certainly, weakens the United Nations 
and the secretary general. If some countries had wanted to, 
they would have been able to change the course of events during 
the past two years. Unfortunately, they did not want to. 
  I am not saying this in order to remove the blame from the 
United Nations or its secretary general. My objective is to 
make some countries take action, in particular those countries 
that have potential, resources, and political and diplomatic 
expertise in order to enlarge the decisionmaking base. Thus, 
international justice can be achieved and decisions will become 
democratic. [passage omitted] 
  [Sunbul] It has been noticed that the current UN secretary 
general is being subjected to a strong campaign of criticism, 
unlike any previous UN secretary general. How do you explain 
this phenomenon? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] (laughing) This is true, and the reason, in 
my 
opinion, is that conditions around the world currently are very 
different from what they were before, during the Cold War years. 
  During the Cold War, there were two superpowers, the United 
States and the Soviet Union. They controlled all the strings. 
They used to make the final decisions on all stands and crises. 
Given this, the role of the United Nations was a secondary one. 
  After the Cold War, the whole picture and the situation 
changed. The world entered a new age, the post-Cold War age. In 
view of these new conditions, the United Nations acquired a more 
effective role. In these post-Cold War times, numerous racial 
and regional conflicts erupted. All eyes focused on the United 
Nations asking for its help. In the past, the UN peacekeeping 
forces were concentrated in two countries. Now, they are spread 
out in 17 countries. The United Nations has become a party in 
many conflicts. Thus, some parties are happy and others are 
angry. This is why the secretary general is being criticized 
more fiercely. In actual fact, it is criticism directed at the 
United Nations as an international organ more than at the 
secretary general as a person. 
  [Sunbul] I have one last question to ask you. I would like 
to go back to the subject of Bosnia and ask you what the 
solution is. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] There is no way out unless the big powers, 
headed by the United States, want to intervene and use their 
power and potential as they did during the crisis between Iraq 
and Kuwait. 
  So long as the big powers are not ready to enter the battle, 
and so long as the countries that have the potential do not want 
to intervene and are satisfied with mere expressions of anger, 
the difficult situation in Bosnia will, unfortunately, continue 
and increase.
