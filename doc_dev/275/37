  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali has described as constructive and positive his 
talks with Russian Defence Minister General Pavel Grachev. He 
thanked Russia for its contribution to the U.N. peace-keeping 
efforts in various parts of the world and expressed hope for the 
continuation of that cooperation in the interests of peace. 
  In his turn, Pavel Grachev thanked the U.N. 
secretary-general 
for that high appreciation and pointed out that it was 
especially important today, when Russia is being accused of some 
"imperial aspiration" by some forces. According to Grachev, 
Butrus-Ghali came up with proposals on Russia's participation in 
a number of peace-keeping operations from the point of view of 
their engineering, rear and technical support. "We agreed to 
those proposals, and shall prepare corresponding units," the 
Russian minister said. 
  Responding to the question of ITAR-TASS whether the granting 
of a U.N. status to our peace-keeping force was discussed at the 
talks, Grachev said that such suggestions were made to 
Butrus-Ghali, and he is going to examine them. He stressed that 
a positive settlement of those problems is connected with the 
problem of financing U.N. peace-keeping operations. The U.N. 
budget envisages two to three such operations a year, while at 
present 17 peace-keeping operations are under way. 
  The Russian side suggested as well the renovation and 
upgrading of the collective security mechanism. Russia 
suggested to the U.N. to bear part of the expenses on the 
transportation and deployment of peace-keeping forces. It is 
also important for us that the armaments and military hardware, 
used by peace-keeping forces, should not be taken into account 
during the calculation of the maximum level of armaments under 
the treaty on the limitation of conventional armaments in 
Europe, Grachev said.
