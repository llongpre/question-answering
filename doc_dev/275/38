  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
referred to the increasing importance of the United Nations in 
peacekeeping and the solution of conflicts in the world in a 
talk with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today. 
Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel announced in Bonn this 
evening that the two sides agreed that efforts to solve the 
conflicts in the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia must be 
resolutely continued. 
  Kohl and Butrus-Ghali assessed the recent UN-sponsored NATO 
operations against Serb positions in Bosnia as "necessary" and 
"appropriate." These were in accordance with the relevant UN 
Security Council resolution. The two sides spoke in favor of 
energetically continuing the peace process with the inclusion of 
the United States and Russia. 
  Kohl underlined Germany's readiness to assume responsibility 
in the United Nations as a permanent member of the Security 
Council in the future. Ghali confirmed that the transfer of the 
UN volunteer program to Bonn is envisaged as the first step. 
Kohl underlined the German Government's offer to have other UN 
bodies located in Bonn. 
  Eberhard Brecht, deputy foreign policy spokesman for the 
Social Democratic Party [SPD], admitted in a statement that 
Germany is still "not up to the international community's 
expectations of our country." The Social Democrats share the UN 
secretary general's view that Germany's commitment to the United 
Nations still does not match its performance in the various 
political spheres. The SPD supports the demand made of the 
German Government by Butrus-Ghali for "a high level of 
commitment in all the organization's activities," Brecht said.
