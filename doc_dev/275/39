  [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- Relations between Cyprus and 
Russia were described as spiritual, as rooted in history, by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and head of the Foreign 
Ministry of the Republic of Cyprus Alexandros Mikhailidhis at a 
news conference in Moscow on Monday following the negotiations 
between the two delegations. The foreign ministers pointed out 
the warmth of relations between the two countries. Mikhailidhis 
is on an official visit in Russia. 
  Kozyrev pointed out the importance of contacts with 
representatives of Cyprus, a Mediterranean country, where Russia 
has "economic and political interests". Russia is interested in 
an earlier settlement of the Cyprus problem on a basis of the 
United Nations resolutions with taking into account territorial 
integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus, Kozyrev said. He said that 
new approaches to the situation in Cyprus and in the region, 
especially after the recent report on Cyprus by U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had been discussed during 
the negotiations. "We have coordinated plans for further steps 
with taking into account the role of Russia, permanent member of 
the U.N. Security Council", the Russian ministry said. There 
was also exchange of opinions on interaction of the two states 
in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe and the United Nations where the stances of the 
parties coincide. Kozyrev noted that the visit by the Cyprus 
foreign minister will promote further development of economic, 
tourist and other ties which will help speed up the working out 
of an agreement of visa-free visits by citizens of the two 
countries. 
  In his turn Mikhailidhis pointed to an important stage of 
the 
settlement of the Cyprus problem that resulted from the 
occupation of the northern part of the insular state over 20 
years [ago]. He described the report by Butrus-Ghali as a 
manifestation of concern of the world community over the lack of 
progress in the Cyprus settlement because of the lack of 
political will of the Turkish side. He said the document is of 
huge importance for Cyprus as the 35-thousand strong Turkish 
military corps with heavy arms is still in the north of the 
island and 90 thousand Turkish settlers live there, which 
interferes with the demographic structure of the Cyprus 
population. "This is the essence of the Cyprus problem", he 
said. 
  "The dialogue with Russia will continue", Mikhailidhis said. 
"We rely on friendship with Russia, noting specifically Russia's 
important role as permanent member of the United Nations 
Security Council and the experience of Russian diplomats in the 
Cyprus problem. Cyprus strives for closer cooperation with 
Russia in every area, also through CSCE, the United Nations and 
soon, I believe, in the Council of Europe", Mikhailidhis said. 
  The ministers signed a protocol on mutual consultations 
between the foreign ministries of the two countries. The Cyprus 
minister meets on Monday with leaders of the State Duma and with 
Patriarch Aleksiy the Second of Moscow and All Russia.
