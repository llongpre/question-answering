  [Text] The contents of a letter President Rauf Denktas 
sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali informing him that the 
Turkish Cypriot side is ready to negotiate on the 
confidence-building measures have been revealed. The letter was 
given to the press yesterday but was embargoed until 1200 today. 
  In the letter, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side is 
ready to cooperate with the UN secretary general in reaching an 
agreement on the confidence-building measures, which it accepts 
in principle. Denktas pointed out that in order to achieve this 
aim, he is ready to start negotiations with Greek Cypriot leader 
Kliridhis. We think it will be beneficial to hold the 
negotiations in Lefkosa [Nicosia], Denktas said. 
  The president told the UN secretary general that the 
government program which was approved by the Turkish Cypriot 
Republican Assembly anticipated that he, Denktas, be the 
negotiator, and that he has accepted this task. We are pleased, 
Denktas says, that the UN secretary general shares the 
understanding of the Turkish Cypriot side regarding the 
confidence-building measures. We have observed, he adds, that 
the various understandings and concepts which we meticulously 
emphasize are also included in the reports the secretary general 
submits to the Security Council. 
  President Denktas stressed that the measures to be 
implemented should not eliminate the limited means of the 
Turkish Cypriot side, that the arrangements to be made in 
connection with Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia] 
International Airport should help lift the embargoes against the 
Turkish Cypriots, and that sanctions should be imposed on the 
side that undermines the interests created by the implementation 
of the measures. 
  Denktas said in his letter that the fenced area of Maras 
which are to be given over to UN rule should be areas of contact 
and cooperation fitting the two communities' common interests. 
If the Turkish Cypriot side is prevented from benefiting from 
Lefkosa International Airport, Denktas said, then this region 
should be returned to Turkish Cypriot rule. 
  The president pointed out that one of the basic principles 
on 
which both sides agreed during the negotiating process was that 
a comprehensive solution should be sought by discussing the 
issue with all its aspects as a whole. It is obvious, Denktas 
said, that the approach to implement measures that will build 
confidence between the two sides will not change this basic 
principle. He added that the United Nations also admits that 
the confidence-building measures aim to reach a comprehensive 
solution easier. 
  Denktas said: I would like to stress that we have noted the 
guarantees in your reports saying that partial agreements will 
not be posited in the future, during our search for a 
comprehensive solution. 
  Denktas recalled that as cited in the 13th paragraph of the 
secretary general's report of 1 July 1993, the aim of the 
confidence-building measures is not to grant political 
advantages to the sides and that within that framework, the two 
sides will not be forced to make political concessions. Also, 
Denktas said, the two sides will not be forced to change their 
positions regarding each other's political status. The two 
sides reserve their positions regarding a comprehensive solution. 
  Denktas went on to say: On the other hand, I would like to 
stress that in our assessment of these measures, we took into 
consideration that one of the results of implementing the 
measures will be the elimination of the obstacles before the 
Turkish Cypriots in the commercial and economic fields, and in 
foreign travel. 
  Denktas stressed that he attaches great importance to the 
reassurances the UN secretary general made that the advantages 
to the two sides will be important, equal, fitting, and 
guaranteed in practical terms. 
  Denktas said: The Turkish Cypriot side's security 
considerations within the framework of the solution of the 
Cyprus problem is a vital issue that the United Nations takes 
into consideration as well. Whether in connection with measures 
that aim to increase mutual confidence, or within the framework 
of the search for a comprehensive solution, security is a 
priority issue for the Turkish Cypriot side. This security 
factor is as valid in connection with the confidence-building 
measures on which we now work. The importance we attach to this 
issue, particularly in connection with the Maras issue, was 
conveyed to the UN secretariat general in a list of questions we 
asked on 23 October 1993. Considering the history of the Cyprus 
problem, I am convinced that you will attach the necessary 
importance to this factor which is of vital importance to the 
Turkish Cypriots. 
  Denktas concluded his letter by saying that he would be 
pleased to confer with the secretary general by accepting the 
invitation he will extend to him at an appropriate time.
