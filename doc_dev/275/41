  [Text] New York, May 3 (TANJUG) -- It appears that the U.N. 
Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) is allowed 
only to open fire, as it did recently at Kalesi and Gorazde, 
when 12 members of the Army of the Bosnian Serb Republic (VRS) 
were killed, according to news reports, but is not allowed to 
see what it sees and to hear what it hears, let alone to say 
publicly anything about it. 
  The above results from U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's reply to a letter received from United States 
U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, in which Butrus-Ghali was 
sharply censured for the statements made by his generals and 
civilian representatives in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which the 
truth was told about the conflict in that former Yugoslav 
republic and the U.S. foreign policy was criticized. 
  Albright a week ago vehemently criticized Butrus-Ghali's 
special envoy for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi for 
refusing to order new air strikes against Serbs at Gorazde, a 
town in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  There followed statements of UNPROFOR commander for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose and other unidentified 
U.N. officials who insisted that the reports from Gorazde were 
false, that the figures about the casualties and destruction 
were overinflated, and that the U.S. had nearly drawn the United 
Nations into a larger-scale war on the basis of incorrect 
assumptions. 
  In the latest letter to the U.N. secretary-general, Albright 
said she was writing to protest in the strongest possible terms 
the comments of U.N. officials who keep the secretary-general 
directly informed through Akashi. 
  Butrus-Ghali replied the same day to the closely-spaced 
two-page letter, saying he shared the U.S. ambassador's deep 
concern over the fact that the criticism of the U.S. policy in 
the former Yugoslavia by ranking UNPROFOR officials had been 
quoted in news reports. The U.N. secretary-general said he had 
sent a letter to Akashi informing him that he considered such 
comments totally unacceptable and requesting a thorough 
investigation. Butrus-Ghali said he had asked of Akashi to take 
all steps for such things not to happen again. 
  Without speculating about whether "the gentleman had backed 
down," as some claim, or just the opposite was true, the message 
is clear: UNPROFOR must keep silent and dance to the U.S. tune. 
  Butrus-Ghali's spokesman Joe Sills has told the press that 
both Akashi and General Rose continue to have the 
secretary-general's confidence. However, it is obvious that 
they do not have Washington's confidence and that whether they 
will keep their current posts will most likely depend on the 
degree of their obedience. 
  Sills practically quoted a part of Albright's letter when he 
said that the secretary-general felt it was not all right for 
ranking U.N. officials or peace operation personnel to criticise 
the policy of Western U.N. member-countries. Sills said U.N. 
officials in the field should use other means than the press to 
get the information to their superior on the east river. It is 
well known, however, that Butrus-Ghali has several times 
"misplaced" key reports about the guilt of the Muslim side in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that he has rejected to publish the 
report of a commission which has investigated crimes committed 
by U.N. troops, primarily U.S., in Somalia. 
  Under the constant threat from Washington that it will cut 
off funds, Butrus-Ghali has decided to close the eyes and shut 
the ears of the UNPROFOR personnel, and has thus reduced the 
United Nations to a blind follower of U.S. policy. The U.S. has 
put a "dollar muzzle" on UNPROFOR and released the safety on 
their rifles. Butrus-Ghali's acquiescence with such a state 
leads the United Nations to an abyss in which the League of 
Nations had found itself prior to World War Two.
