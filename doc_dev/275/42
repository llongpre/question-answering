<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] Today or tomorrow UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali will send the Security Council an official letter 
praising the Turkish side. According to informed sources, the 
letter will constitute a supplement (upon a Turkish request) to 
the UN secretary general's latest report and will note the 
progress achieved in the talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, 
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas after 30 May. The letter 
will mainly be based on a report prepared by Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, following 
his recent visit to the island and will be as important as an 
official document. Because the events will be listed, the 
clarifications and positions raised by Denktas in his meetings 
with the United Nations will be given official status. Despite 
Nicosia's objection, the submission of the letter will certainly 
mean that the procedure is continuing. 
  From there the Security Council will make decisions on the 
Cyprus issue. Obviously, at least behind the scenes, the 
British will proceed to "marry," promote, two of the options 
included in Butrus-Ghali's latest report. Reliable circles say 
the British element -- having long left the initiative to the 
United States -- will attempt to undertake an initiative on the 
Cyprus issue. 
  Analyzing developments and the facts in the Cyprus issue, 
the 
Foreign Office believes that no move must force President 
Glavkos Kliridhis to "reject" the procedure that will be 
formulated. Clark already received a negative reply when he 
asked the president to agree to incorporate the Vienna 
agreements in the 21 March UN document. In their own interests, 
as usual the British will try to find a formula that will be 
accepted both by Kliridhis and Denktas. 
  How will they proceed? A diplomatic source noted yesterday 
that according to all the signs the "five" are being oriented in 
promoting a formula that will keep the confidence-building 
measures on the negotiating table and at the same time begin a 
long-term discussion of the Cyprus issue. The same source 
mentioned that signs are being reinforced that the Security 
Council believes every move is made on the basis of 
Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas and the confidence-building 
measures. They claim there is 90 percent agreement on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  The Turkish side has launched a large-scale diplomatic 
campaign abroad to convey the idea that Denktas accepts the 
confidence-building measures. The reality is this: The 
military officers, the National Security Council, recently 
confirmed a decision to remain "open" on the Cyprus issue. The 
orders that have been given insist that a policy be followed on 
a political level to show that the Turkish side is contributing 
positively to developments. This is why Denktas, who has 
recently been calling on Turkey (obviously for advice), must 
give "yes" and "no" answers to the mediators. The current 
Turkish strategy dictates that many fronts must be kept open 
with Greece. 
  All that is certain is that the UN Security Council will 
decide on the next steps within the next few days. The 
substance of the decision is known to an extent. The question 
is how to express it, because it requires a positive reply from 
both sides.
