  [Text] United Nations February 10 TASS -- Russia warns of 
serious consequences of air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
notes that all issues connected with the use of air force should 
be settled under the aegis of the U.N. Security Council, says a 
letter by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev addressed to 
U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali circulated as a 
Security Council document here on Wednesday. 
  The Russian minister said that he read with great attention 
the letter of January 28 from the U.N. secretary-general to the 
Security Council president where Butrus-Ghali spelled out 
versions of the use of air force to ensure the rotation of 
troops in Srebrenica and to open the airport in Tuzla. 
  "We regard this letter as an important step aimed at 
fulfilling provisions of appropriate Security Council 
resolutions, which rule that all issues pertaining to the use of 
air force in security areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina and around 
them to help U.N. peace keepers in implementing their mandate, 
are to be settled under the leadership of the Security Council, 
provided there is close cooperation with the U.N. 
secretary-general," Kozyrev noted. 
  He wrote: "Frankly speaking, the very possibility of a force 
cover for opening the airport in Tuzla fills us with misgivings. 
I'd like to explain: We voted for ensuring security for U.N. 
peace keepers and do not preclude a direct air cover for U.N. 
peace keepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina if they are attacked. 
  "However, one should clearly understand that any strikes, 
even if limited within the scope of an air cover, will bring 
about serious consequences. Situation at all the fronts in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina will sharply deteriorate, which will more 
likely result in an end to humanitarian aid and will put into 
jeopardy the entire U.N. operation. 
  "Taking into account far-reaching consequences of possible 
decisions on involving air force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we 
believe as before that their adoption should be an exclusive 
prerogative of the U.N. secretary-general in consultation with 
the U.N. Security Council. You and I have reached a clear 
understanding, as it seems to me, on this point," the Russian 
minister stressed. 
  Kozyrev expressed confidence in the effectiveness of only a 
political solution of the situation concerning the opening of 
the airport in Tuzla and called for "the earliest political 
settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina".
