  [Text] Argentina supports "the firmness of international 
reaction against attacks on Sarajevo inhabitants," and places 
itself at the disposal of the United Nations to perform 
humanitarian tasks. 
  This means that our country will support the UN position 
whether it is decided they will use planes to defend the Bosnian 
areas under attack or conduct military operations against the 
attackers. 
  The Argentine Foreign Ministry reported that Emilio 
Cardenas, 
Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, said so to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali during a long meeting they 
held on 8 February. 
  Following clear instructions given by Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella, who is visiting three Caribbean countries, Cardenas 
told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that President Menem's administration 
will support the UN decision on air operations. 
  It has not been reported, however, whether Argentina merely 
supports the operations or also will participate in them. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella explained to LA 
NACION in New York: "It must be made very clear that Argentina 
does not approve measures of force; all it did was offer full 
support to whatever the secretary general may decide." 
  Cardenas told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that Argentina strongly 
rejects attacks against Sarajevo's civilians. He insisted on 
"the need to consider the possibility of using security troops" 
from the United Nations who currently are controlling the region 
and include Argentine units.
