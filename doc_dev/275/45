<F P=106> [Letter from Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze to UN </F>
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali; read by announcer] 
  [Text] To His Excellency UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  Esteemed Mr. Secretary General, I would like to greet you 
and 
convey to you my people's best wishes. 
  I had to write this letter because of a further 
deterioration 
of the situation in Abkhazia, which, as you know full well, was 
already extremely tense. The Abkhaz separatists have repudiated 
their obligations under the memorandum signed in Geneva on 1 
December 1993 and the communique adopted on 13 January 1994, and 
on 7 and 8 February of this year launched a new Fascist action. 
  An about 1,000-strong group with heavy equipment attacked 
Georgian villages in Gali Rayon, burned down up to 800 
residential houses, and staged the mass killing of civilians. 
Several thousand Georgians were uprooted from their permanent 
places of residence and joined the tens of thousands of 
displaced people and refugees. Mountain villages in Gali Rayon 
beyond the reach of the armed groups of separatists were shelled 
with heavy artillery. 
  The hallmark of Abkhaz separatists can be easily recognized 
in the latest disaster. Their common practice of ethnic 
cleansing and terror against civilians is continuing. All this 
shows that the Abkhaz side is not interested in the 
establishment of peace. 
  Let me remind you, Mr. Secretary General, that the 
large-scale punitive operation was carried out against the 
population of the rayon where, under the Geneva communique of 13 
January 1994, the first stage of the return of the displaced 
persons and refugees should have started on 10 February. Events 
of the last few days suggest that the stepping up of military 
operations by the Abkhaz separatists is aimed at wrecking the UN 
Security Council resolutions, the process of normalization in 
relations between Russia and Georgia, and the establishment of 
peace throughout the Caucasus region. 
  We have chosen a peaceful way of conflict settlement. An 
alternative to this way is military escalation and the 
resumption of hostilities, which will result in the spreading of 
the conflict zone, enormous casualties, and a great disaster -- 
not only for Georgia. 
  The only solution is to speed up the sanctioning by the 
United Nations of the deployment of peace-keeping forces in 
Abkhazia and to introduce strict international supervision. 
  I appeal once again to the United Nations Organization, the 
Security Council, all its members-states. I appeal to you to 
take a decision without delay on the deployment of a 
peacekeeping force and the immediate return of the refugees. 
  I appeal to the leadership of Russia, on whose mediation and 
peace mission to a large extent depends the future of peace in 
Georgia and, in particular, Abkhazia. Take all measures for a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict and a timely return of the 
refugees. 
  I hope that at this most difficult time for the Georgian 
people, the United Nations and its Security Council in 
particular will have a principled examination of this issue, 
which causes us so much pain, and will take a decision to send 
peacekeeping forces to the conflict area immediately. 
  In the event of the opposite, an escalation of the conflict 
can be expected not only in Abkhazia but also in the whole of 
Georgia, which may result in unforeseen tragic consequences 
throughout the Caucasus. 
  I would like to express my gratitude for your constant 
striving for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia 
and assure you of my best [word indistinct]. 
  Yours sincerely, 
  [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze, Tbilisi. 
  [dated] (?9) February 1994.
