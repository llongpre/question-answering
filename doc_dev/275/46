  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that a 
picture has begun taking shape as to what the next steps by the 
United Nations on the Cyprus issue should be. In a statement 
after his meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali this 
evening, Mr. Mikhailidhis added that the picture will be 
formulated as soon as Gustave Feissels' report on his latest 
meeting with Rauf Denktas arrives at the UN Headquarters. Asked 
to comment on reports that Denktas has accepted the 
confidence-building measures, the foreign minister said that the 
important thing is what Gustave Feissel will say to the 
secretary general and not what Denktas says. He added: The UN 
Secretariat is ready, as soon as it receives the Feissel report, 
to finalize the plan of action and suggestions with which it 
will apply to the Security Council. 
  The foreign minister further noted that he has the 
impression 
that the suggestions he made to the secretary general will be 
jointly assessed in formulating the positions of the UN 
Secretariat. 
  A press spokesman for the UN secretary general said that at 
the meeting they discussed all the aspects of the secretary 
general's good offices mission including the confidence-building 
measures and other questions of substance. The spokesman said 
that the United Nations continues to feel that the set of 
measures proposed is balanced with advantages for both sides. 
He was not in a position to comment on the latest Denktas 
statement and made it clear that he is waiting for Feissel's 
report. 
  In an interview with Voice of America, the foreign minister 
described the results of his contacts in Washington and New York 
as very satisfactory. He added: The suggestions by the Cypriot 
side for getting out of the current situation concern the need 
for a new approach to the Cyprus issue for the Security 
Council's involvement which would mean upgrading the dialogue 
and strengthening the whole effort as well as creating a new 
agenda. The foreign minister concluded: The Cypriot side's 
suggestions were listened to with care and interest and will be 
evaluated properly.
