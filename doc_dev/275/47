  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz conferred with UN 
Secretary General Butrus Dr. Ghali in New York today. 
  Following the meeting that lasted for more than one hour, 
'Aziz told journalists that his meeting with the secretary 
general was beneficial and positive. He added that he briefed 
the secretary general on Iraq's position in detail, and 
emphasized that the United Nations should fulfill its 
obligations toward Iraq because Iraq fulfilled its obligations 
toward the United nations. 
  'Aziz emphasized that the main subject is lifting the siege 
on Iraq in accordance with Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, 
especially since Iraq fulfilled all its commitments as 
stipulated in this paragraph and in accordance with the text and 
spirit of Resolution 687. 
  The deputy prime minister explained that the Security 
Council 
should consider this in order to end the suffering of the Iraqi 
people. He said he briefed the secretary general on the full 
picture of Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations, 
especially the Special Commission and the international agencies 
operating in Iraq. 
  'Aziz added that Iraq's relations with the agencies are 
good, 
and the concerned authorities cooperate with these agencies, and 
this is evidence that Iraq is prepared to cooperate with the 
international organizations. 
  'Aziz said Iraq has furnished the evidence of its 
cooperation 
with the international community, in accordance with UN Charter 
and the international law, but some Security Council members 
still maintain their hostile position toward Iraq, and they 
should respect the Security Council resolutions and the 
international law and stop interfering in Iraq's affairs. 
  The deputy prime minister expressed hope that the 
international community and all Security Council members would 
study the situation well in order to lift the siege on Iraq. 
  Tariq 'Aziz also conferred with (Francesco Paolo Voly), 
Italian ambassador to the United Nations at his residence in New 
York today. 'Aziz is scheduled to meet later with Detlef Graf, 
German ambassador to the United Nations, and (Jean Damasan 
Besiman), Rwanda's ambassador and Security Council member.
