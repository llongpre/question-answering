  [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--The UN Information Center in 
Cairo has denied that the United Nations or Secretary General 
Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali has any connection with a conference on 
minorities in the Arab world scheduled to be held in Cairo on 12 
May. 
  Hidayat 'Abd-al-Nabi, UN information official in Cairo, said 
Dr. Butrus-Ghali will not address the conference, adding that 
his name was associated with a conference with which he has no 
connection. 
  In a statement to MENA, 'Abd-al-Nabi said this conference is 
one among thousands of conferences held by nongovernment 
organizations and research centers. She added that the 
conference will be held under the joint auspices of the 
Ibn-Khaldun Center for Studies in Cairo and a London-based 
nongovernment organization that specializes in minority affairs. 
  'Abd-al-Nabi said the conference's name gives the impression 
that the United Nations is involved. She said that "the United 
Nations has no connection with the conference despite the title, 
which refers to the UN declaration on minority rights." 
  She added: To clarify the uproar that exploded in the media 
recently when an invitation was sent to the UN secretary 
general, the invitation did not mention the Copts of Egypt. 
  She stressed that on 12 April the UN Secretary General's 
Office declined the invitation on behalf of Butrus-Ghali.
