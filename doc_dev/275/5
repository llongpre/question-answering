<F P=106> [Report on interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali by Kjell Dragnes in Oslo; no date given] 
  [Text] The UN role in Bosnia is not a fiasco, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said. The problem has not been 
solved, but people are working actively so that it will be. 
  Fourteen years as Egyptian foreign minister, the peace 
settlement between Egypt and Israel in 1977, the many subsequent 
crises in the Middle East -- all of this was a tough, but good 
preparation for Butrus-Ghali who is now 71 years old and has 
been head of the United Nations since January 1991. "I believe 
that I am well-trained to tackle the many crises the United 
Nations has to tackle," the secretary general said in an 
interview with AFTENPOSTEN. 
  It is not a tired leader -- despite all the crises and the 
many rounds of talks here in Norway -- who today ends his 
two-day visit to Norway. The only thing he regrets is that he 
has no opportunity to travel home to Cairo to see one crisis 
move toward its solution: the signing of an agreement between 
the PLO and Israel tomorrow. 
  "But I have asked your Foreign Minister (Bjorn Tore) Godal 
to 
represent me," he said. 
  How do you view the development within the United Nations 
from peacekeeping to peacemaking operations? 
  "I think that we should clearly limit our role to 
peacekeeping, and this is in line with the spirit of the United 
Nations. But if we need peacemaking in order to be in a 
position to distribute food, to give humanitarian assistance, to 
stop those people who do not respect the resolutions adopted by 
the United Nations, who are committing genocide and atrocities, 
the international community should not hesitate to make use of 
peacemaking operations," the UN secretary general said. 
  He said that 15 of the UN's 17 operations are peacekeeping 
operations. Article 7 of the UN Charter gives scope for 
peacemaking operations, but it was only once the Cold War was 
over that these became possible. 
  It is in this context that Butrus-Ghali sees the former 
Yugoslavia. The general picture is that the United Nations has 
not had particular success, but the UN head does not agree. The 
United Nations has succeeded in preserving peace in Macedonia, 
has given aid to 2 million refugees and exiles, and on the whole 
has maintained the safe areas in Bosnia. 
  Thorvald Stoltenberg is given much praise for his role as 
mediator, and Butrus Butrus-Ghali was not sparing in his praise 
of Norway's efforts -- in the form of soldiers and money. With 
a scarcely audible sigh he said that if only others among the 
UN's 184 members had been as well-disposed.... Some 160 have 
not paid their membership fees or made contributions to the UN 
operations. The United Nations finds itself in the midst of a 
major economic crisis, with a deficit of $1 billion, and this 
does not make it any easier to tackle the world's problems. 
"But if the members contribute money and troops I am sure that 
the United Nations can tackle the various crises," the secretary 
general said emphatically. 
  The United Nations celebrates its 50th birthday next year. 
Many people take the view that the organization should be 
reformed. What is your view? 
  "We will have many ceremonies next year, and we hope that 
through these we will be able to mobilize world public opinion 
in favor of the United Nations, give a better picture of it, and 
win greater support for the organization," the secretary general 
said. "In addition there will be a very important conference in 
Copenhagen which will create a greater understanding of the 
social element -- something that is important these days." 
  The UN leadership has also distributed to member countries a 
questionnaire on reforms, especially of the Security Council. 
Most people are agreed that reforms are necessary, that new 
members should be admitted to the Council. But they disagree 
about which. "I believe that it will be a long debate," the 
general secretary said, adding, "I hope they will be able to 
accept certain fundamental changes to strengthen the Security 
Council and strengthen the UN system." 
  The message from the secretary general is that the reforms 
will be a long process, but once the member nations make up 
their minds to invest in the United Nations, demonstrate the 
political will, and realize that the United Nations is the only 
organization which can tackle global problems, they will then be 
on the right road. 
  Yesterday was filled with meetings, first with Prime 
Minister 
Gro Harlem Brundtland, then with Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore 
Godal, and then an audience at the Palace. Yesterday evening 
the prime minister hosted a dinner for the secretary general and 
his wife, Maria Leia Butrus-Ghali, at Akershus Castle. Today 
Butrus-Ghali will honor the memory of the very first UN 
secretary general, Trygve Lie, by laying a wreath on Lie's grave 
in Grorud churchyard. Talks at the Storting are also on the 
agenda before he travels on to Geneva this afternoon.
