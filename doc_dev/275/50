<F P=106> [Editorial by Hasan Sabra: "Butrus-Ghali, Listen to the </F>
Bosnians"] 
  [Text] "If you have any honor, you should resign." This is 
what Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali following the barbaric Serbian attack on 
Gorazde. 
  We cannot but congratulate the Bosnian president for his 
words to the UN secretary general, although we are confident 
that the latter will not heed Izetbegovic's advice for obvious 
reasons of which the secretary general is aware. 
  The secretary general is in the habit of denouncing any 
legitimate operation mounted by dispossessed Palestinians 
against the Jewish usurpers in the land of Palestine, equating 
such actions with the attacks the Zionists wage against 
Palestinians, Lebanese, and Arabs everywhere every day. Such a 
man, of course, will hardly find fault in the failure of the UN 
forces to perform their simplest duty in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
that of stopping the massacres against the inhabitants of that 
country. 
  We never thought the secretary general likely to deviate 
from 
the Western line of thinking and decision-making. 
Butrus-Ghali's elevation to his current job was, after all, a 
reward for certain policies of which he and the Egyptian regime 
are aware. The day Butrus-Ghali defies Western--more 
specifically American--wishes will certainly be his last on the 
job. Nor do we hope for a UN secretary general who is not of 
Butrus-Ghali's type in the foreseeable future. 
  We do not think that Butrus-Ghali's being Orthodox makes him 
sympathetic to the Orthodox Serbians in their continuous and 
barbaric aggression against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
We do not think that ethnic bias taints his position in the 
Muslim- Serbian strife. 
  The secretary general, an Arab, will understand the meaning 
of the Arab saying: "Do not flaunt your sins." Is there a 
worse sin against ethics, values, and human rights than to 
remain silent when you monitor and know, even beforehand, the 
massacres the Serbs are perpetrating against Bosnians, whose 
only crime was to want a separate home of their own. 
  We did not need to wait for the UN's silence about Serbian 
crimes to reach Izetbegovic's conclusion. We long ago made up 
our minds about the secretary general--an Arab, to our lasting 
shame. 
  Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who fully backs Western and U.S. 
persecution of Iraq, its people, and its children through an 
embargo of which innocent Iraqis bear the brunt? The real 
criminals are still free in Iraq, and living very well at the 
expense of their downtrodden people. 
  Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who condoned, and still 
condones, 
U.S.-Israeli pressure on a weak and defeatist Palestinian 
leadership? The latter is now set to cooperate in the 
liquidation of the Arab-Zionist conflict, an outcome that suits 
Western, particularly U.S., interests. 
  Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who condones Zionist crimes and 
the way in which the United States backs these crimes at the UN 
Security Council? 
  Would this secretary general ever tell us what he thinks 
when 
he sees UN resolutions trampled under the feet of the Zionists, 
the West, and the United States, particularly those resolutions 
concerning the Arab-Zionist conflict? These are resolutions 
that merely aim to deter Israel, psychologically at least, from 
attacking Arab children, women, and men. 
  We did not await Butrus-Ghali's silence about the Serbian 
barbarism in Bosnia-Herzegovina to say to the man: Speak up and 
walk out. He made up his mind a long time ago. Since the 
moment he got on the payroll of the United Nations he become an 
employee of the U.S. Administration. He takes his orders from 
the United States, particularly in matters involving the 
flogging of his fellow Arabs and Third World wretches, doomed to 
live under the U.S. thumb. 
  Butrus-Ghali came to office to follow orders. If he does 
not, he will lose his job. And he knows that. He would not 
want to trouble his remaining days with moral questions or 
ethical considerations that only bother prophets, and he is not 
one.
