  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali advised the 
Security Council [UNSC] to prolong the mandate of the UN mission 
of observers in Georgia until 15 March 1994. It was mentioned in 
the speech by the UN secretary general on the situation in 
Abkhazia, which was circulated here in the United Nations as a 
document of the Security Council. 
  It is mentioned in the speech by Butrus-Ghali that the 
Security Council on 4 November 1993 adopted Resolution No. 881 
and approved maintaining a presence of a small UN mission of 
observers in Georgia until 31 January 1994 for establishing 
links with both of the conflicting sides as well as Russian 
military contingents. The Security Council decreed not to 
prolong the mandate of the mission beyond 31 January 1994 unless 
the secretary general reported to the council of considerable 
progress in carrying out the measures aimed at achieving a solid 
peace. 
  The Geneva memorandum of understanding signed on 1 December 
1993 points to a hopeful progress in establishing a solid peace 
in the region, said Butrus-Ghali. It was exactly in this 
connection that on 22 January 1994 the Security Council adopted 
Resolution No. 892, said Butrus-Ghali, which gives a sanction to 
the United Nations to gradually deploy about 50 additional 
military observers -- besides the five who are already there [in 
Georgia]. 
  Butrus-Ghali said: In Paris, the Georgian head of state 
Eduard Shevardnadze and I thoroughly discussed the situation in 
Abkhazia. He asked me earnestly to give recommendations to the 
Security Council for a speedy deployment of the UN military 
observers in Abkhazia. Considering the results of my talks with 
Shevardnadze, I ordered my colleagues and the chief military 
observer of the UN observers' mission in Georgia to study the 
expediency of a further growth -- over 55 observers -- of the 
number of UN observers in Georgia.
