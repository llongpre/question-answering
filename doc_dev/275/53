<F P=106> [Address by Second Executive Deputy President F.W. de Klerk </F>
to introduce UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali at The 
Presidency in Pretoria -- live] 
  [Text] President Mandela, Your Majesties, Your Royal 
Highnesses, heads of state, heads of government, Your 
Excellencies, all the dignitaries here, ladies and gentlemen: 
It is my great privilege to introduce our guest speaker, the 
secretary general of the United Nations. 
  Today is a great day for all South Africans. When Mr. 
Mandela shortly addressed the last crowd down on the lawns 
beneath the Union Buildings, his plea was that we should forget 
the past. I would like to add to that, that we as a nation will 
now stretch out to the future. We face tremendous challenges in 
South Africa. I'm confident that we will, in accepting those 
challenges, succeed in achieving the goal which we share with 
each other in the government of national unity, and that is, to 
bring lasting peace to our country, to bring new wealth to our 
country, and to use that new wealth in a caring manner, to 
improve the quality of life of all our people. [applause] 
  We also have, we believe, a pivotal role to play in our 
subcontinent, in Africa, and believe also in the international 
community. We have, to a certain extent, been starved of cross- 
pollination in the years of isolation. We have needs, if we 
look at the international community. We have needs in looking 
at the United Nations. We need much closer interaction. We 
need access to many of the world's resources in solving our own 
problems. But we also have something to give. We have 
expertise, applied technology to the conditions of Africa. [as 
heard] We have infrastructure, and we have a commitment to be a 
good neighbor to all our neighboring countries in southern 
Africa and higher up. [applause] 
  As a country we, therefore, stand ready, willing, and able 
to make a constructive and a positive contribution, but we need 
partners, and we pledge ourselves to work with the international 
community, to work with the United Nations, to work with other 
international agencies, and to work with the major leading 
countries of the world -- America, the European Union, Japan, 
and others - in addressing also problems far beyond our borders. 
It is for us a great honor to have so many heads of state, 
heads of government, and such eminent international leaders here 
today, and specifically, Mr. Secretary General, to have you here 
today, you who have brought a new dimension to the influence, 
success, and activities of the United Nations. We have watched 
carefully your career thus far, and we are impressed by what you 
have achieved through the United Nations in your term of office. 
We salute you. [applause] 
  We thank the United Nations and the European Union and the 
Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity for their 
involvement in this election. The observers played an honorable 
role, and the United Nations, in coordinating their activities 
locally also played a leading role, and we thank them for it 
very specifically. [applause] The watching eyes of the observers 
I think ensured that there was inhibition on the side of those 
who might have had a tendency at times to become too exuberant. 
Mr. Secretary General, it is my great honor and pleasure to ask 
you to please address this eminent gathering. [applause]
