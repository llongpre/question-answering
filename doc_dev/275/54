  [Text] According to information received tonight by the 
Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New York, 
intense negotiations are to be held at the United Nations after 
the collapse of efforts by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
representative in Cyprus, to implement the confidence-building 
measures. Clark is expected to arrive in New York tonight and 
will have an emergency meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  UN Security Council circles told our correspondent that 
Clark 
is disappointed with the deadlock and is seriously considering 
whether to renew his contract, which expires on 15 May.
