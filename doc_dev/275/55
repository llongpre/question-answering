<F P=106> [Report on interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali in New York; no date given] 
  [Text] New York -- He leaves no one indifferent, he is 
loved and hated, he is called "the dictator" and "the genius," 
he wants to achieve miracles in the new world order which has 
prevailed since the end of the Cold War. Never before has the 
United Nations had such acontroversial a leader. 
  And on this dark December afternoon, with large snowflakes 
falling over New York on the eve of the new year, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is alert, provocative, and 
pugnacious. He is full of ideas and vision which he discussed 
energetically during the hour-long interview he gave while 
seated on the leather sofa on the 38th floor of UN Headquarters. 
  As usual, he was dressed in a pin-stripe suit, but today his 
eyes were more tired than usual. Butrus-Ghali has just returned 
from a mission to North Korea, where he has been trying to 
persuade Pyongyang to allow the United Nations to inspect 
installations where it is suspected that nuclear arms are being 
developed. In this his first interview since his visit to North 
Korea Butrus-Ghali said that "the political will actually exists 
to avoid an escalation of the nuclear arms conflict." 
  "It was a very fruitful visit. There is a crisis of such 
proportions that a solution here would have an effect on the 
spread of nuclear arms in the world. It is something positive 
that there is a political will in both North and South Korea to 
resolve the crisis using peaceful means. 
  "Whether North Korea has nuclear arms? I do not know. But 
we have to have a swift solution since there are many people 
interested in buying nuclear arms," Butrus-Ghali said, clearly 
referring to countries like Iraq, Libya, and Pakistan. 
  The new idea which the UN chief has developed but which is 
upsetting many UN countries and is causing many employees to 
leave the world organization relates to the UN's future role of 
"peace-enforcing" instead of "peacemaking" or "peacekeeping." 
In simple terms this means that the United Nations would shoot 
to create peace in conflict-torn countries. Somalia is an 
example, but an unhappy one. In Somalia the United Nations used 
military force in an attempt to enforce peace. But the 
operation went awry, and many UN soldiers were killed as were 
Somali civilians. But Butrus-Ghali still thinks that the idea 
of greater militarization for the United Nations is a good one. 
  "If the power of the state in a country is divided, we need 
to go in to replace the police in a country, as in Somalia. 
And, if the narcotics mafia takes over in a country, it could 
happen that the United Nations would go in and restore order," 
he said. 
  Asked whether the United Nations is to be some sort of world 
policeman he replied gruffly: 
  "Who else would do the job? 
  "The UN countries should have national troops in readiness 
for peace-enforcing and peacekeeping operations. This means 
that within 24 hours I would be able to have 80,000 UN soldiers 
ready," said the UN head, who believes that "80 percent of all 
conflicts today are regional and could be resolved using a few 
thousand men." 
  But the United Nations must combine the three strategies in 
the future. The three missions of "peace-enforcing, 
peacekeeping, and peacemaking" should go hand in hand, in 
Butrus-Ghali's view. Once a peace has been enforced societies 
and countries must be rebuilt, confidence must be created 
between those in conflict, rivals must be disarmed, and 
"preventive diplomacy" must be used to prevent new conflicts 
before they break out. And here the United Nations will play 
the main role. 
  But in the view of critics the three UN roles are 
irreconcilable. If the United Nations starts to hunt the person 
pointed out as the villain in a conflict, the United Nations 
would also become part of the conflict -- something that 
conflicts with the whole UN idea of objectivity and 
impartiality. A vengeful "UN enemy" could select humanitarian 
aid operations as a target for shelling. 
  The "villains" in the conflict are also needed in the 
reconstruction of the country, but they are hardly likely to 
want to work with a United Nations which has killed their men. 
The arguments against "peace-enforcing" are being stacked up by 
irritated UN countries which are asking with concern where their 
almost 50-year-old peace organization is heading. 
  "Of course there are risks. But you have to accept the risk 
of dying to defend peace. Nor can we provide humanitarian aid 
without peace, and this is why peace must first be made. And 
also, if a war continues, the need for humanitarian aid becomes 
so much the greater." 
  Sweden's Jan Eliasson, assistant secretary general for the 
UN 
humanitarian aid operations, recently made headlines when he 
decided to leave his post as one of Butrus-Ghali's closest 
aides. It has been reported that two reasons for his resignation 
are the UN head's ideas about soldiers instead of humanitarian 
aid, and the difficulties of working with Butrus-Ghali who has 
the reputation of being intolerant, despotic, and arrogant. 
  "No, no, no. There are no problems between us. Eliasson's 
family was not happy here in New York and went back to Sweden. 
Eliasson wants to be with his family. That is how simple things 
are. There are no problems about working together. Naturally, 
everybody has problems sometimes; that is only normal," 
Butrus-Ghali said brusquely. 
  He went on to patiently defend himself against the criticism 
of his "dictatorial behavior" and of the UN headquarters as 
"pharaoh's court." 
  "I think that things are working very well. I never reach 
decisions without first discussing things very carefully with 
others. Arrogant? That is a misreading of self-confidence," he 
said, adding, not without some pride: 
  "Did anyone care about the United Nations three years ago? 
Now the United Nations has become important. Perhaps the 
United Nations has too much credibility nowadays, more than we 
deserve," Butrus-Ghali said, explaining why he is a good UN head. 
  "I am an activist. I have a great deal of faith in the UN 
system and have been writing books on the subject for more than 
50 years. I am also proud of being physically able to cope with 
this work load! But even if I am Superman and Einstein, I am 
nothing without the help of the UN countries." 
  He said that the United Nations has radically increased its 
peacekeeping operations from two to 22 over a few years, while 
the budget for peacekeeping operations has only increased from 
$1 billion to $4 billion, and UN staff numbers are the same as 
before. 
  "This is my greatest success as UN secretary general. My 
biggest failure is the economic crisis at the United Nations 
which I will unfortunately not be able to resolve. Many 
countries are refusing to pay until the UN administration is 
reformed. Pay now, then we will reform!" Butrus-Ghali roared, 
adding irritatedly that "the members paid billions during the 
Cold War, but now they are not paying a penny to make the UN 
more powerful. They are not prepared to give the United Nations 
a new role." 
  In Butrus-Ghali's view, countries do not perceive the 
threats 
in the world in the same way as during the Cold War. Previously 
there was a "black-and-white" situation with a well-defined 
enemy that you had to defend yourself against. 
  "For the Soviet Union the enemy was capitalism, while the 
Soviet Union was `the evil empire' for the Western world. Today 
the threats are more diffuse and more difficult to explain to 
public opinion. How do you explain that environmental damage 
can harm the world more than a war, that ethnic wars are a 
sickness which could infect the whole world, that a new type of 
poverty in rich cities is growing, that the narcotics trade is 
worth as much as defense during the Cold War, that AIDS is as 
dangerous as the plague in the Middle Ages? These problems are 
not producing the same involvement as during the Cold War," he 
said. 
  "The problem with the problems is that we have far too many 
problems at one and the same time." 
  The UN head takes the view that the rules in "the new 
world" are still unclear, as is the future role of the United 
Nations. Much is expected from the United Nations, but the UN 
nations lack determination. 
  "Some countries want to give the United Nations a new role, 
but they do not want to risk lives in peacekeeping operations. 
Many countries are prepared to see their own soldiers fall in 
defense of their homelands, but they have not understood that 
their sons could also die to defend other countries!" 
Butrus-Ghali also believes that increased globalization leads 
to increased religious fundamentalism, not only among Muslims, 
but also among Jews, Christians, and Hindus. 
  "People feel less secure in this age of increased 
globalization. To feel more secure they go back to their 
tribes, traditions, to old values. We have not succeeded in 
finding a new ideology since the collapse of Marxism. When 
everything collapsed a vacuum was formed -- and this is now 
being filled by fundamentalism in different forms." 
  But in two countries things seem to have "collapsed" more 
than in others. These are the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. 
However, the UN head takes the view that the humanitarian 
efforts in Bosnia have been successful, but that "on the other 
hand we have not succeeded in finding a political solution." He 
said that what is needed is "more patience, political 
imagination, and persuasion." 
  "In Somalia the failure is limited to southern Mogadishu. In 
95 percent of the country we have succeeded and famine has 
decreased. What is important now is to achieve peace between the 
various parties within a couple of months," the UN Head said 
with a sigh. 
  The burden of responsibility lies heavy on his shoulders, 
perhaps also because he never has time off, can never go to the 
theater or relax. There is no such thing as leisure time in 
Butrus-Ghali's life -- "that is one of my frustrations." If, 
contrary to expectations, he were to take a holiday, "I sleep 
all the time." But in 1995 he will have more time. 
Butrus-Ghali has determined to retire after a term of five 
years, in order to write more books. 
  "I do not want to continue after 1995. I will then be 74. 
You cannot go on after that age without becoming senile. Let 
us be practical." 
  After that, 10 to 20 years into the future, his dream is a 
United Nations which is the world's "think tank." 
  "The ideal is a House of Reflection to which the UN 
countries 
will come and discuss long-term developments. Social 
developments are accelerating more and more rapidly and we are 
finding ourselves with new global problems. That is why we 
should think about solutions to problems 20 year into the 
future, but implement them now. But for this, a whole new 
mentality is needed."
