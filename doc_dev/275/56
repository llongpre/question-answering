  [Text] New York, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- UN chief Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali voiced hope Wednesday that North Korea's acceptance 
of nuclear inspections would help to stabilize nuclear 
non-proliferation and the United Nations. Meeting South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Butrus-Ghali called North Korea's 
decision a breakthrough in the nuclear problem that was heading 
to a dangerous end. The decision, in the long run, will serve 
as an important impetus for inter-Korean relations, as well as 
maintenance of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the 
United Nations, the secretary-general was quoted as saying. 
  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) 
have just agreed on resumption of nuclear inspections last held 
in February 1993. The inspectors are to check whether North 
Korea has diverted any of its nuclear materials since then. 
  Foreign Minister Han called the development an incomplete 
solution, but nevertheless satisfactory and important progress 
that provides a breakthrough in the dispute. 
  South Korea will continue efforts to achieve stability in 
the 
region, Han told the secretary-general. 
  The foreign minister explained Seoul's decision to make an 
early withdrawal of its army unit from Somalia, while promising 
to take an active interest in future UN peacekeeping operations 
there. 
  Seoul has announced it is pulling out its army engineering 
unit three months ahead of schedule as most western nations are 
withdrawing.
