<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "United Nations: Andreatta on </F>
Peacekeeping Operations"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 22 -- The United Nations has been 
aiming too high with its peacemaking and peacekeeping operations 
which in 1993 ended up with partial successes and some failures, 
said Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta on Tuesday [22 March]. 
The United Nations "probably expected too much. It has tried 
to carry out operations without sufficient experience," 
Andreatta told a meeting of representatives from religious news 
agencies. 
  "The 1993 results, the result of (UN Secretary General 
Butrus) Butrus-Ghali's pride in organising peace forces to 
rebuild public well-being and order, to rebuild countries, has 
ended in very partial successes. And in some cases in failure," 
the foreign minister was quoted as saying in a text released 
after his appearance. Andreatta accused the United Nations of 
attempting peacekeeping operations "without sufficient 
experience; it has sent troops with somewhat precarious chiefs 
of staff. But on the whole it seems to me that it meant well." 
  As Italian troops concluded their pull-out from Somalia, 
which they are leaving with all the other Western contingents 
there, Andreatta painted a bleak picture for that East African 
nation, saying that without an organised state it is difficult 
to imagine justice, development or respect for human life. "You 
cannot expect to transfer the democratic state model of Western 
industrial powers with no perception of anthropological 
complications, as Americans of good will but little experience 
often do," said Andreatta. "This is the problem that the 
experiences of the Butrus-Ghali secretariat will leave to the 
United Nations," the foreign minister said. 
  Despite setbacks for UN operations, he concluded, failure to 
intervene in crisis points would not put the situation to right. 
"It would seem to me to be a mistake," he concluded, "on the 
basis of these initial experiences, to suggest that the world 
community should not take an interest in those parts of the 
world where all legal power has disappeared, and where anarchy 
reigns supreme."
