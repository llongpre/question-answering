  [Text] The Government of Tanzania has again stressed its 
intention to continue seeking ways to bring about peace in 
Rwanda in order to save the lives of Rwandans. This was 
expressed by the minister of foreign affairs, Joseph Rwegasira, 
at a news conference regarding the peace talks which were 
scheduled to take place in Arusha today. 
  Rwegasira said the delegation of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, 
RPF, led by its secretary general, Theogene Rudasingwa, vowed to 
stop fighting in Rwanda tomorrow and he stressed the need for 
all sides involved in the conflict to implement the Arusha peace 
agreement. 
  However, Rwegasira, on behalf of the prime minister and 
first 
vice president, John Malecela, who is the chairman of the 
current talks, said even if the delegation of the Rwandan 
Government failed to arrive either today or tomorrow, the 
government [of Tanzania] would use diplomatic channels to 
communicate with that side to restore peace in Rwanda through a 
cease-fire. 
  The UN secretary general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has 
called 
on both sides fighting in Rwanda to stop the killings 
immediately and reach an agreement to implement the resolve for 
peace, reached in Arusha last year. In a statement issued in 
Arusha today, the UN secretary general called on both sides to 
cooperate with the UN team which is assisting them so that the 
team can fulfill its duties as directed by the UN Security 
Council. Butrus-Ghali also expressed his concern over the 
prevailing situation in Rwanda, where these two groups are not 
showing signs of ending their conflict [words indistinct]. Dr. 
Butrus-Ghali said the United Nations has decided to let its 
peace-keeping force stay in Rwanda, provided that the two sides 
stop fighting and stop killing officers of the United Nations in 
Rwanda and other aid organization officials and innocent 
civilians.
