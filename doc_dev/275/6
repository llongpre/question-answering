<F P=106> [Interview given by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali </F>
to IZVESTIYA; date and place not given: "Butrus-Ghali: UN Does 
Not Exist To Punish People. UN Secretary General Answers 
IZVESTIYA's Questions"] 
  [Text] [IZVESTIYA] In what way does the United Nations 
hope to reconcile the principle of noninterference in other 
states' internal affairs with its efforts aimed at asserting 
human rights and democracy worldwide? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The definition of human rights is contained 
in international treaties to which states accede on a voluntary 
basis. After the treaties are ratified, states assume 
international pledges to respect the spirit and letter of these 
agreements. As a result, the international community of nations 
acquires the powers to monitor and observe how states observe 
the pledges they have entered into. Moreover, existing 
international law sees major human rights violations as 
legitimate grounds for alarm. 
  [IZVESTIYA] How do you plan to combine the right of 
self-determination and the principle of the inviolability of 
state borders? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Although the term "self-determination" has 
not yet been clearly defined, the international community 
recognizes that all peoples have the right of self-determination 
and are free on that basis to choose their political status and 
to implement their economic, social, and cultural development. 
Implementation of the right of self-determination should not 
infringe the territorial inviolability or political independence 
of any state. 
  [IZVESTIYA] What methods of punishing states which violate 
UN principles are currently under consideration? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The United Nations does not strive to 
"punish" states which violate its principles. 
  But if the Security Council considers it necessary, it can 
call on parties to a dispute whose continuation could pose a 
threat to the maintenance of international peace and security to 
resolve that dispute through negotiation, investigation, 
mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, judicial examination, or 
an appeal to regional organs. 
  The Security Council can also call on UN members to break 
off 
economic relations or rail, maritime, air, postal, telegraph, 
radio, and other forms of communication with the state violating 
international norms, as well as breaking off diplomatic 
relations with it. 
  [IZVESTIYA] How does the United Nations rate the prospects 
for the use of armed forces for peacekeeping purposes? Practice 
has shown that even the operations in Cambodia failed to produce 
the expected results. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The establishment of peace is primarily tied 
in with the utilization of armed forces against those who use 
force to violate a peace agreement. This approach is laid down 
in the rules governing peacekeeping operations. But the main 
question is different -- will the United Nations have enough 
military resources to carry out such measures, and will it have 
enough political will to see them through? If the answer to 
both questions is in the affirmative, then it may be possible to 
establish peace. [Butrus-Ghali ends] 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on a 
five-day official visit to the Russian capital Friday. The VIP 
guest's first statement to journalists on Russian soil was 
brief: "I am very glad to have the opportunity to visit Moscow 
again."
