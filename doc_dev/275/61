  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella today confirmed the dispatch of Argentine troops to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina region. He pointed out, however, that it 
still must be determined if the troops will travel from Buenos 
Aires or if some of the troops serving in Croatia will be 
transferred. 
  Therefore, Di Tella confirmed that Argentina will provide 
military cooperation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina region, accepting 
a petition made by UN Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali, who 
also asked for a special $10 million financial contribution for 
the peace operation there. 
  Before opening an OAS-sponsored seminar on the security 
issue 
at the Alvear Hotel in this capital, the foreign minister 
admitted today: "We are studying if the troops deployed in 
Croatia will be transferred, new troops will travel, or a mixed 
contingent, involving these two alternatives, will be deployed." 
  For his part, Defense Minister Oscar Camilion said Argentina 
"will not be squandering money" by dispatching a 150-man 
contingent to the Bosnia region. He said: "It is a reasonable 
contribution to the peace of a country whose fate has caught the 
world's attention." 
  Thus, Camilion challenged the criticism leveled by some 
political leaders over Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's 
compromise with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. These 
political leaders understand that there are other priority 
issues. 
  In this regard, Camilion admitted that "there are other 
pressing needs," but championed the governmental decision to 
dispatch troops to Europe's most conflictive region because "it 
represents a medium-term interest in the existence of a global 
situation of good relations." 
  The defense minister summarized: "Argentina will play a 
small role in this peace process, because there will be 
thousands of troops there and Argentina will merely contribute 
150 soldiers." 
  The Argentine compromise was established on 14 March after a 
meeting between Argentine President Carlos Menem and the UN 
secretary general, who also asked for a special financial 
contribution for the funds allocated to the peacekeeping 
operations. 
  Argentina has more than 800 troops deployed in Croatia, a 
region in the former Yugoslavia where there are virtually no 
more armed clashes. Therefore, Butrus-Ghali sought to guarantee 
Argentina's presence in Bosnia, where the United Nations plans 
to deploy between 10,000 and 15,000 Blue Helmets.
