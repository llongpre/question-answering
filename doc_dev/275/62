  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 28 
December on the significance of UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's recent visit to Pyongyang on the nuclear issue. 
  The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on page 3 
carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled ``Butrus-Ghali and 
Dissolution of the UN Command.'' 
  Noting the ineffective result of his visit to Pyongyang on 
the North Korean nuclear issue, the editorial reported: ``We 
hope UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who has been to the 
North and South, will pay special attention to future 
North-South relations, including the nuclear issue, and consider 
those involved in his approach to the settlement of the issue. 
Kim Il-song, a North Korean man of absolute power, is 
decisively important in resolving the nuclear issue. Many 
figures who have met Kim Il-song said, however, that he was not 
likely to be well aware of the seriousness of the nuclear issue. 
Therefore, it is important to inform Kim Il- song of the 
seriousness of the nuclear issue. This can be effective when he 
has a heart-to-heart talk with Kim Il-song.'' Referring to the 
importance of the UN secretary general's role in the settlement 
of the nuclear issue and the need for his frequent visits to 
North Korea to achieve this, the editorial reported: ``We paid 
attention to his remarks that the UN Command will be dissolved 
if peace is achieved on the Korean peninsula. We expect peace 
to be achieved on the Korean peninsula so there will not be a 
need for the UN Command. The UN Forces exist as a last resort to 
prevent events that run counter to peace from taking place.'' 
  The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 
800-word editorial entitled ``The Result of UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's Visit to North Korea.'' Referring to North 
Korea's refusal of UN mediation in the settlement of the nuclear 
issue, the editorial stressed that ``President Kim Il-song 
clearly said there is no need for the United Nations to mediate 
the nuclear issue because North Korean-U.S. negotiations are now 
under way.'' Noting North Korea's intention to directly hold 
negotiations with the United States regarding the nuclear issue, 
the editorial reported: ``It is the ROK that is directly 
threatened by North Korean nuclear development. Nevertheless, 
North Korea wants to only hold direct talks with the United 
States with the intention of establishing diplomatic 
relations.'' Noting UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's 
proposal for the replacement of the armistice agreement with a 
peace treaty in peacetime on the Korean peninsula, the editorial 
reported: ``For a long time, North Korea has been calling on 
the United States to replace the armistice agreement with a 
peace treaty, but the North and South have differences as 
parties to the conclusion of the peace treaty. The North and 
South must be parties to the conclusion of the peace treaty.'' 
The editorial urges North Korea to show a positive attitude 
toward the international climate for the settlement of the 
nuclear issue. 
  The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on page 3 
carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled ``The North Korean 
Nuclear Issue--Can We Get Through This Crisis?'' The editorial 
refers to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's visit to North 
Korea as an occasion to ``get through'' the nuclear issue 
crisis, reporting that ``in his meeting with Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali on 25 December, North Korean President Kim Il-song 
assessed that there are positive signs in the ongoing North 
Korean-U.S. negotiations.'' The editorial urges South Korea to 
persuade North Korea to clearly dissolve the suspicion regarding 
its nuclear development.
