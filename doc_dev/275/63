  [Text] New York, June 25 (TANJUG) -- Ousted from Bosnia by 
the ruling of the 1878 Berlin Congress after centuries of 
occupation, Turkey is now being sent back by the U.N. 
secretary-general. The former occupier is returning 116 years 
later under the guise of a "peacekeeper." Apparently aware of 
the paradox, Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has long 
opposed the idea of including Turkey in the U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in the breakaway Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, seeing this as being sharply at odds with 
the proclaimed principle that neighbouring countries and former 
occupiers could not serve as peacekeepers in the Balkan crisis. 
  Eventually, because of a poor response from the other 
nations 
to an appeal to donate troops to UNPROFOR, the principle has 
gone the way of many another and was trampled underfoot by 
Butrus-Ghali's "yes" to the Turks. However, Turkey's historical 
occupation of Bosnia and return, this time under the wing of the 
United Nations, is not the only paradox which has made the 
peacekeeping force a mockery. 
  Turkey has a notoriously smudged record in international 
relations, which the West is inclined to turn a blind eye to 
because of the country's strategic importance to NATO. One has 
only to remember Turkey's presence in Cyprus, where its forces 
have held one-half of the island under occupation for twenty 
years. One might think that Turkey has spent the past twenty 
years under sanctions for the occupation. Not so. Turks remain 
in Cyprus, the United Nations wastes billions of dollars on 
maintaining a peacekeeping force there, but there is no mention 
of sanctions from any quarter. 
  Sanctions seem to be reserved for the likes of Serbs, 
Haitians, Iraqis and, possibly, North Koreans. Nobody is even 
trying to answer the question whether a country can be an 
occupier of a neighbour and still serve as a peacekeeper in 
another country, which it held under subjugation for centuries, 
at that. 
  U.N. press spokesmen have recently been stunned by the 
provocative question whether Serb peacekeeping troops might be 
sent to Cyprus. The question seemed absurd and provoked gales 
of mirth from the assembled reporters. Nobody laughed about the 
deployment of Turks in Bosnia- Herzegovina. And indeed, this is 
no laughing matter. 
  The Western media raised hue and cry in February when 300 
Russian troops were to be deployed in Sarajevo. However, the 
world is taking in its stride the deployment of 1,500 Turks, in 
addition to the Malaysians, Jordanians and Egyptians already in 
Bosnia and the announced arrival of Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. 
The hypocrisy of the international community knows no bounds. 
  Another important and unanswered question emerges, viz. can 
a 
country enforce law and order in another state, while being 
unable to keep its own house in order. Turkey is notorious for 
its violation of human rights, and ranks fifth in the world for 
the number of journalists in prison. The world has forgotten the 
first big genocide of the 20th century, which was perpetrated by 
Turks killing more than a million Armenians. Similarly, the 
Western media today have deliberately forgotten the genocide 
perpetrated by the Nazis against the Serbs in World War Two. 
  This, then, is the picture of the state which is returning 
to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a "peacekeeper." All this should be 
reason enough for the powers that be on the east river to take a 
closer look at the moral criteria to be applied to would-be 
peacekeepers. There is no sign, however, that anybody is likely 
to give the matter a thought. 
  According to the latest information, the 1,500 Turkish 
troops 
and experts will be deployed along the lines of separation 
between Moslems and Croats in the areas of Zenica and Kakanj in 
central Bosnia. But, can one really believe that this will be 
so, after so many principles have been trampled on. According to 
a statement submitted by the Turkish mission to the United 
Nations, the Turkish troops are bringing to Bosnia 393 vehicles, 
including 70 trucks and 33 armoured cars. The statement was 
withdrawn before it could be seen by most of the reporters, 
leaving behind a massive speculation about 200 vehicles which 
are mentioned en masse, but not separately described. 
  It is a generally recognised fact that Turkey has been 
smuggling arms to the Moslems in Bosnia. So now it would appear 
that it is helping their brothers in Allah with one hand, while 
tipping its blue helmet with the other. When to this is added 
the ease with which international institutions and the Western 
media are ignoring the latest Moslem offensive in Bosnia, it is 
not clear whether the world wants peace or war in Bosnia. Or is 
it.
