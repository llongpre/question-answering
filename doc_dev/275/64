<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin </F>
and Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow 4 April, TASS -- Visiting U.N. Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali highly appreciated the level of 
interaction between the Russian diplomacy and the world body in 
solving problems of maintaining peace in the territory of the 
former Soviet Union and peacekeeping operations in other areas 
of the world. Ghali was addressing a press conference in the 
Russian Foreign Ministry press centre today after his meetings 
with Russian officials. 
  According to the secretary general, Russia is one of the 
founders of the U.N.O., a permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council and a super power. That is why the U.N. is interested 
in that Russia should play an important role in international 
affairs. Ghali assured that the U.N. will provide maximum 
possible help to Russia to overcome temporary transitional 
difficulties. He expressed the hope that this transitional 
period will be quite short. 
  The U.N. secretary general recalled that the international 
organisation is going to celebrate its 50th anniversary next 
year. In this context he spoke about intentions of the U.N. to 
organise three international conferences. A summit meeting on 
questions of social development will be held in Copenhagen in 
March 1995, a conference on problems of population and family 
planning will be organised in Cairo in September, and finally, 
the third international conference on problems of women will be 
held in Beijing, he said. Butrus-Ghali said that he had 
received support from the Russian leadership in organising U.N. 
golden jubilee celebrations.
