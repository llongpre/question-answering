<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Ban Nuclear Weapons''] </F>
  [Text] United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
has just visited Pyongyang, capital of North Korea. 
  Lately the United States has been pressuring international 
agencies to persuade North Korea to allow inspection of its 
facilities and has even threatened to nuke North Korea if they 
ever built and used one. Butrus-Ghali was on a mission to 
intercede between the U.S. and North Korea. North Korea has not 
accepted the International Atomic Energy Agency's request to 
inspect its facilities and considers its nuclear activitis to be 
peaceful and regards U.S. attempts as bullying moves of 
intimidation. 
  What is unfortunate is that the secretary general of the 
United Nations is putting himself at the disposal of one of its 
members, namely the United States. 
  This is an important and opportune occasion (the birth of 
Jesus Christ); the secretary general should have considered 
other places. For instance, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cries for intervention of an international body. Butrus-Ghali 
could have visited Serbia to put pressure on Serbs to end the 
genocide and massacre of innocent people. 
  The question of nuclear weapons should worry any 
conscientious individual. Weapons of such destructive powers 
are no toys for any military. Only the United States has used 
this weapon (in World War II). The Islamic Republic of Iran has 
maintained that its nuclear activities are peaceful and 
representatives of international agencies have repeatedly 
confirmed this. 
  Governments with nuclear capability claim to be stable and 
promise to take measures to control its military use. The 
former Soviet Union was such a stable government. When 
President Reagan was shot, the confusion in the White House as 
to ``Who is in control!'' testified to another stable government. 
  Conscientious individuals in the world have been rallying to 
ban nuclear weapons. Iran also believes that since nuclear 
weapons are dangerous and destructive, and that they could get 
out of control and create a world disaster, no country should 
have them.
