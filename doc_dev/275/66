<F P=106> [Editorial: "Butrus-Ghali's Report"] </F>
  [Text] The UN secretary general's latest report on the 
Cyprus issue is expected to be submitted to the Security Council 
in the next few days. Press reports on Butrus-Ghali's report 
are contradictory. Some say that the UN secretary general will 
criticize the Turkish side about the deadlock and some say he 
will not. The Cypriot Government believes that Butrus-Ghali 
will condemn the Turkish side for its stance and it seems that 
is has received some assurances about it. Nothing is certain, 
however, because it is well known that 
behind-the-scenes-intervention--particularly by the 
Anglo-Americans--which is common in such cases, could overturn 
everything! The possibility that the same factors will 
intervene in this case and the report will be modified is not 
ruled out. 
  Rumors are already circulating that there is a difference of 
views between the United Nations and the U.S. diplomats, 
particularly Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, who refuses to admit that the 
Cyprus issue has reached a deadlock. At the same time, Lamb 
claims that "significant progress" has been achieved in the 
proximity talks. Of course it is well known that the U.S. 
official is not telling the truth, but due to his position and 
his mission he can influence things, and his intervention could 
cause the UN secretary general's report to be extensively 
modified. 
  It is worth noting that the Cypriot officials are not at all 
satisfied with Lamb's whole position and behavior. This man 
does not give a clear and objective picture of the facts, hides 
the truth, and tries to cover up the Turkish intransigence and 
provocativeness. In any case, for obvious reasons the Cypriot 
Government cannot come into an open confrontation with Lamb, who 
is attempting to present Turkey's stance as heroic in order to 
mask Turkish intransigence. 
  The U.S. coordinator went to Ankara yesterday for a new 
round 
of talks on the Cyprus issue. Without doubt, when he leaves 
Ankara Lamb will say that the Turkish Government gave new 
assurances that it will cooperate with the United Nations to 
implement the confidence-building measures! 
  We do not believe that with the policy they are following 
the 
Americans contribute effectively to promoting a Cyprus solution. 
On the contrary, their stance confuses things. This is because 
if the Turks know that the United States, the only country that 
can seriously affect them regarding Cyprus, not only is not 
pressuring them but on the contrary is covering up their 
intransigent and provocative stance, then why should they agree 
to make any concessions? We believe that it must be pointed out 
to the Americans that they must look at the Cyprus issue from a 
different angle and at a higher level than Robert Lamb! And the 
Cypriot people expect U.S. President Bill Clinton--who rules the 
planet--to act on his promises. We must also make our own 
decisions. Unfortunately, we are confined to words, statements, 
and declarations. This is the bitter truth.... [as published]
