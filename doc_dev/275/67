  [Text] The National Council met in a three-hour session 
last night and dealt with the current developments following 
their determining that the process of promoting the 
confidence-building measures has for the time being stalled due 
to [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas' insistence on 
unacceptable positions. During the meeting, President Glavkos 
Kliridhis briefed the National Council members on a draft letter 
he had prepared for UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
giving the position of the Greek Cypriot side. This letter is 
to sent to the secretary general following a similar letter sent 
to Butrus-Ghali by Denktas. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President 
Kliridhis does not consider Denktas' answer on the 
confidence-building measures to be positive, stressing that it 
contains the old demands in disguise. 
  Speaking after the National Council meeting, DISI 
[Democratic 
Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis noted that Kliridhis' letter to 
Butrus-Ghali deals with all the positions Denktas presented in 
his own letter to the secretary general, which are just as 
negative as they were in New York. Responding to a question on 
whether we are considering disengaging from the 
confidence-building measures and discussion of the substance of 
the Cyprus issue, Matsis said that all issues are now at the 
forefront. 
  AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary 
General Dhimitrios Khristofias said he estimates that Denktas 
will not change his positions, but added that he does not 
consider that Denktas' letter proposes unacceptable terms. 
Unfortunately for our side, Denktas' letter is framed in a 
diplomatic way. Khristofias expressed the view that our side 
will be in a difficult position. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou repeated 
that he considers the confidence-building measures to be 
dangerous, and that the best possible development would be to 
disengage from these measures. Denktas' letter, he said, 
reveals that the Turkish side wants to use the 
confidence-building measures to gain even greater benefits in 
its effort to promote its goals. 
  Socialist EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman 
Vasos Lissaridhis said that Kliridhis' letter to the secretary 
general offers a golden opportunity to deal with the substance 
of the Cyprus issue. If this golden opportunity is not used, he 
said, there is a danger of getting involved in indirect talks on 
the implementation of the confidence-building measures, which, 
he added, constitute a de facto solution of the Cyprus issue.
