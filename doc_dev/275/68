<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Ciampi and Andreatta on Air </F>
Strikes in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Premier Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi said here today at the conclusion of the NATO 
summit that decisions already taken by the United Nations 
Security Council open the doors to the possibility that allied 
military commanders might unleash eventual NATO air strikes 
against Bosnia while, however, keeping in constant contact with 
the UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  For his part, Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta 
said it was "unimaginable" that Butrus-Ghali would not authorize 
interventions which, basically, would be directed at the 
alleviation of the difficult situation in which UN ground forces 
find themselves in Bosnia. 
  Ciampi and Andreatta were speaking to journalists here in 
connection with that part of the summit's final statement which 
deals with Bosnia and, in particular, with the confirmed standby 
readiness of alliance members to launch air strikes to break the 
stranglehold on Sarajevo, to rotate out the Canadian blue 
helmets blocked at Srebrenica and to reopen the Tuzla airport to 
humanitarian airlifts. 
  Dire situations like those at Srebrenica and Tuzla are all 
too concrete and call out for United Nations forces to be put in 
a position to carry out their mandate, even if that means 
intervention by NATO planes, Ciampi said. However, any step in 
this direction must be carefully analyzed, taking into account 
all possible consequences, including reprisal action and the 
difficulties of pinpointing with certainty those responsible for 
the situations one wants to remedy, Andreatta added. 
  However, it is not with fighter bombers that the Bosnia 
problem will be solved, but by convincing the belligerents that 
a military solution to the conflict has already been tried and 
cannot be repeated, the Italian diplomatic chief continued. 
  "The illusion of a spring offensive" is today the worst 
enemy 
for chances of peace in the former Yugoslavia, he said. 
  The NATO summit ended here Tuesday without reaching 
agreement 
on new wording for a threatened air strike on Serb forces. The 
final communique only called on the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] command in Bosnia to "urgently draw up plans to ensure 
the rotation of the UN forces at the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica and to examine how to reopen the airport at Tuzla," 
without referring to military action that NATO might undertake 
to achieve these goals. 
  The document reiterated last August's reference to air 
strikes that may be undertaken by NATO -- at the request of UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- to prevent the 
"strangulation" of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the other 
Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  United States President Bill Clinton expressed the view that 
today's declaration, while not making substantive changes to the 
August stance, "increased the possibility of the use of air 
strikes in Bosnia."
