<F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations, 25 May -- Ukraine is calling upon 
the United Nations to support its possible actions in Crimea "to 
ensure unconditionally the territorial integrity of the state." 
Thus runs a letter from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which was 
distributed today as a General Assembly and Security Council 
document. 
  "On 20 May 1994, the Supreme Rada of the Republic of Crimea 
adopted a decision on re-enforcing the constitution of the 
Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992. This act is aimed at changing 
the legal status of the autonomous republic as a component part 
of Ukraine," it indicates the document points out. Having 
described these actions by the Crimean parliament as "a 
violation of the Constitution of Ukraine," A. Zlenko stated that 
"a threat is thereby being created to peace and stability in the 
region and in Europe as a whole." 
  The minister expressed the hope that "the UN secretary 
general will personally show understanding and support" for the 
actions of the government of Ukraine in "averting the possible 
negative consequences of the anti-constitutional decision 
adopted by the Supreme Rada of Crimea." In the event of a 
deterioration in the situation, Ukraine reserves the right to 
take all the necessary measures to provide for the territorial 
integrity of the state, the document stresses.
