  [Text] The text of a letter from President Glavkos 
Kliridhis to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali concerning 
Rauf Denktas' second letter to the Secretary General was 
released a short while ago. The full text of President 
Kliridhis' letter is as follows: 
  Your Excellency: At 2:00 a.m. on 29 January, I received a 
photocopy of a letter dated 28 January 1994 which Mr. Rauf 
Denktas addressed to Your Excellency. 
  I would like to draw Your Excellency's attention to the fact 
that the letter bears the letterhead Turkish Republic of North 
Cyprus [TRNC], Office of the President, and the signature Rauf 
Denktas, President. 
  Your Excellency is aware, of course, of Security Council 
Resolution 541 of 1983 which, in paragraph one of its functional 
section, deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot 
authorities of the secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus; 
in paragraph two it considers the declaration referred to above 
as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal; and in 
paragraph seven it calls upon all states not to recognize any 
Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus. 
  The Turkish side, completely ignoring Security Council 
Resolution 541, not only has not withdrawn the secession action 
but, what is even worse, Mr. Denktas, in complete contempt of 
Resolution 541 and ignoring the Security Council, signs a letter 
to the Secretary General as president of the TRNC. Mr. Denktas' 
motive is obvious. He intentionally signs his letter to you as 
president of TRNC in order to gain recognition of the secession, 
knowing that by so doing he is violating Security Council 
Resolution 541. 
  It is my steadfast view and position that Mr. Denktas' 
letter 
of 28 January 1994 constitutes another serious violation of 
Resolution 541 and since I would not like to participate, either 
directly or indirectly, in such a violation I must ignore 
completely the existence of Mr. Denktas' letter of 28 January 
1994 and its contents as well as any notification of any 
information which emerges from this letter. 
  Therefore, I respectfully submit to you that, for the 
reasons 
I outlined above, the United Nations should handle Mr. Denktas' 
letter dated 28 January 1994 in a similar manner. 
  Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of my highest 
consideration. 
  Glavkos Kliridhis, President of the Republic of Cyprus.
