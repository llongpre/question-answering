<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Kallinikou] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nicosia and Athens yesterday expressed 
satisfaction with the contents of the UN secretary general's 
report to the Security Council, whereas [Turkish Cypriot Leader] 
Rauf Denktas launched an attack against Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
Most Cypriot political parties also expressed satisfaction with 
the fact that the report very clearly blames the impasse on the 
Turkish side and that, for the first time, the Turkish side's 
lack of political will has been recorded. However, AKEL 
[Restorative Party of the Working People] expressed concern and 
the Free Democrats Movement [former President Yeoryios 
Vasiliou's party] expressed the view that...the Turkish side has 
been reinforced. [passage omitted] 
  AKEL General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said that he 
does not believe that we should be happy with the report because 
the secretary general admits that the package of 
confidence-building measures is clearly in favor of the Turkish 
Cypriot side and that among the alternative actions more weight 
is given to the option of continuing the discussion of the 
confidence-building measures, even though the report refers to 
taking strong measures against Denktas. Khristofias said: "We 
would combine the discussion of the substance of the Cyprus 
issue with the assumption of practical and strong measures, 
which would force Denktas and Turkey to discuss the substance of 
the issue on the basis of UN resolutions." He also added that 
no one has the right to celebrate about anything. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou said: "At 
first glance, it is evident that the UN secretary general's 
report clearly blames the lack of agreement on the 
confidence-building measures on the Turkish Cypriot side. He 
says that there is no political will, but he does not mention 
Turkey clearly. He should have had the courage to name Turkey. 
He also refers to others in the region who do not have the 
political will. I want to believe that he implies Turkey, and 
not anyone else." Kiprianou also stressed the need to remind 
the international community that the Cyprus issue is a problem 
of invasion, occupation, settlement, and violation of human 
rights. 
  EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Vice Chairman Takis 
Khatzidhimitriou stressed that the report does include, at least 
theoretically, the possibility for measures to be taken against 
Denktas. Khatzidhimitriou said that in his report the secretary 
general appears, even if only a little, to imply that Turkey 
does not have the political will for a solution to the Cyprus 
problem. For the first time, he said, there is also a reference 
to measures, something we are not used to hearing from the 
secretary general. He added that the report is lenient but the 
reference to possibilities that could be used in the future 
gives our side the opportunity to assume initiatives. 
  Liberal Party Chairman Nikolaos Rolandhis described the UN 
secretary general's report as exquisite. He said: "In his 
report, the secretary general stressed his clear concern for 
Cyprus and the lack of progress on the problem. The worst 
alternative for our side is the withdrawal of the United Nations 
from Cyprus as a peacekeeping force and as a political presence; 
the second worst alternative is to return to Butrus-Ghali's set 
of concepts; the third worst is to continue with the 
confidence-building measures and some other plan, including an 
idea to take measures against the Turkish Cypriots. It is clear 
that if President Glavkos Kliridhis had not followed the policy 
he did our position now would have been difficult, and I think 
that the only alternative now would have been for the United 
Nations to withdraw from Cyprus." 
  Free Democrats Chairman Yeoryios Vasiliou described the 
report as objective. However, he added that the report shows 
how big a mistake it was to get involved in the dialogue on the 
confidence- building measures. Vasiliou said: "The report is 
objective, but it does not give anyone the right to celebrate. 
On the contrary, it shows how big a mistake it was to begin 
these negotiations on the confidence-building measures and how, 
as a result of these negotiations, the Turkish Cypriot side has 
been reinforced and our side has become weaker." 
  Finally, ADISOK [Democratic Socialist Renewal Movement] 
Chairman Mikhail Papapetrou expressed satisfaction with the 
report because it clearly blames the Turkish side for the 
impasse and states that the lack of political will by the 
Turkish side systematically blocks all the efforts for a 
solution to the Cyprus problem. In addition, he said, for the 
first time the report mentions measures to pressure the Turkish 
side. Furthermore, Papapetrou said that the UN secretary 
general's report creates future prospects for the issue and also 
confirms the correctness of the political forces that have 
supported the confidence-building measures. [passage omitted]
