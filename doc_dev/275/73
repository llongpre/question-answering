  [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The Security 
Council voted unanimously today to extend UN operations in the 
former Yugoslavia by six months and increase troop strength by 
3,500. 
  The United Nations Protection Force, which was established 
in 
February 1992, now has 31,335 peacekeepers in the region. 
  With cease-fires achieved by Muslims and Serbs in Sarajevo 
and by Muslims and Croats in central Bosnia, the United Nations 
needs more troops in Bosnia to help maintain the peace. 
  The number of troops approved by the council today fell far 
short of the 8,500 called for by Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. This was partly because the United States is 
already overextended in financing the operation. 
  U.S. Deputy Ambassador Edward Walker told the council that 
the American concern has been to "ensure that the financial 
resources are available to sustain this vital operation." 
  The United States, which pays about 30 percent of the cost 
of 
all peacekeeping missions, already owes more than 80 million for 
UN operations in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Besides authorizing more troops for Bosnia, the resolution 
also asks NATO to extend air cover for UN troops in Croatia. 
  The Chinese delegation expressed its concern over the use of 
air cover for UN troops. "With regard to the question of close 
air support over the territory of the Republic of Croatia, the 
Security Council should act prudently," said Chen Jian, Chinese 
deputy representative. 
  "It has been stated repeatedly by the secretary-general's 
special representative on the former Yugoslavia that air support 
should only be used to ensure the safety of UN personnel in the 
performance of its mandate and for self-defense, rather than 
using excessive force for punitive purpose," he added.
