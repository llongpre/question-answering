  [Text] Minister of the Presidency Oscar Alfredo Santamaria 
today denied that the government received any official document 
sent by the UN secretary general on nonfulfillment of the peace 
agreements. 
  During this past weekend, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] coordinator Shafik Handal reported that Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali told a delegation of former guerrillas who were 
visiting the United Nations that he had sent a letter to 
President Alfredo Cristiani in which he asked him to accelerate 
the application of some agreements, such as the deployment of 
the PNC [Civilian National Police], the former fighters' 
rejoining civilian life, and the transfer of land. 
  A UN spokesman recently notified an FMLN delegation that 
traveled to the United Nations that Butrus Butrus-Ghali had sent 
a letter to President Cristiani requesting that he make use of 
his power with the same interest so that some pending agreements 
related to the PNC and the transfer of land be implemented. 
However, the minister of the presidency denied this report. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] We have not received any 
notification from the UN secretary general. [end recording] 
  Santamaria explained that the government, the FMLN, and 
Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] are working on a new 
schedule with regard to the deployment of the PNC. The official 
added that nonetheless, the PNC issue is moving ahead well with 
regard to deployment. He also said that it is false that the 
government is not interested in fulfilling its commitments. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] The United Nations has made no 
such statement. All I can say is that at the end of its 
transition period, this government is committed to having 
concluded and implemented all of its agreements. Naturally, 
some of them will continue, because some agreements are 
scheduled to be concluded after the transition period. [end 
recording] 
  Nonetheless, Dr. Santamaria admitted there are some delays 
in 
the programs to have the former fighters rejoining civilian life 
related to the transfer of land. According to him, this is due 
to the lack of financial support which the international 
community had promised to solve.
