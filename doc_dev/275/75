<F P=106> [Report by Alana Gandra in Rio de Janeiro] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian Congress has approved the government's 
request for authorization to send peacekeeping troops to 
Mozambique. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim discussed the issue 
with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and only budget, 
technical, and military logistical matters have yet to be 
resolved with the United Nations. Amorim said: 
  [Begin recording] In any case, the UN secretary general 
again 
conveyed to me that he is interested. We are now discussing 
budget, technical, and even military logistical matters with the 
United Nations, i.e. whether we will be sending a battalion or a 
company. A battalion consists of 700 men, while a company 
consists of more than 200 men. We will probably be sending a 
battalion to Mozambique. [end recording] 
  The cost of sending an Army battalion stands at 
approximately 
$40 million, which will be reimbursed by the United Nations.
