  [Text] In a lengthy report to the UN Security Council dated 
30 May that was finally circulated early this morning, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali makes the Security Council 
responsible for any decision on the procedure and substance of 
the effort to resolve the Cyprus issue. Despite the fact that 
Butrus-Ghali clearly blames the lack of an agreement on [Turkish 
Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas, the secretary general calls on the 
Security Council to study five choices that he proposes to deal 
with the situation in Cyprus. 
  Specifically, the secretary general, who considers the 
situation in Cyprus unsatisfactory, noted as the first 
alternative the withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping force from the 
island and its use elsewhere, because during the past 30 years 
it has been proven that there is no political will for a 
solution to the Cyprus problem. 
  The second alternative deals with the change of his mandate 
and the assumption of mandatory measures by the international 
community to force the intransigent side, as he put it, to be 
more flexible and cooperative in the negotiations on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  The third alternative suggests a return to the substance of 
the Cyprus issue, specifically to the secretary general's Set of 
Ideas. 
  In his fourth alternative, Butrus-Ghali asks for time to 
consult with the Security Council members, the guarantor powers, 
the two leaders in Cyprus, and others so that he will have the 
flexibility to examine alternatives with significant 
consequences. 
  Finally, the fifth alternative is based on the fact that the 
two sides have accepted the package of confidence-building 
measures in principle and calls on the international community 
to repeat its efforts to achieve an agreement on the 
implementation of the measures. 
  Furthermore, Butrus-Ghali proposes various ways to approach 
the issue, including an international conference, a visit by a 
Security Council delegation to Cyprus and the region, or new 
visits by his special representative. However, the UN secretary 
general notes that the process thus far has convinced him that 
it is possible to achieve an agreement if there are new changes 
to the confidence-building measures. At the same time, he 
reaffirms his support for the measures. 
  In his report, Butrus-Ghali notes that the Security Council 
is again faced with a familiar scenario, that is, no agreement 
mainly because of the lack of political will on the Turkish 
Cypriot side and warns that its way of thinking will have 
serious consequences for the Turkish Cypriot community's 
prosperity. 
  The report also says that the UN secretary general 
categorically denies the Turkish claim that the original 
document on the confidence-building measures of 1 July has been 
improved for the benefit of the Greek Cypriots. The secretary 
general proceeds with an analytical comparison of each aspect of 
the two documents of 1 July and 21 March. In addition, he 
submits the two maps of Nicosia Airport and Famagusta. 
  According to the CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
correspondent in New York, the Security Council is expected to 
begin deliberations by the end of the week so it can issue a 
resolution.
