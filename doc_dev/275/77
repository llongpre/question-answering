  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has sent a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali stating that the Turkish 
Cypriot side has the will to conclude an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures issue. Denktas also requested 
including developments that occurred after 30 May. 
  According to information obtained by the ANATOLIA AGENCY, 
Denktas pointed out in his letter that he has shown flexibility 
on the issues concerning access to Maras [Varosha] as well as 
the map submitted by the United Nations; he added, however, that 
these positive developments were not conveyed in Butrus-Ghali's 
Cyprus report. 
  In his letter Denktas noted: I have inspected the report 
regarding your mission of goodwill and I will communicate to you 
my assessment on this subject at a suitable time. Despite the 
items in the report which are unacceptable and detrimental to 
the Turkish Cypriot side, however, we are not in favor of 
stopping the negotiation process on the confidence-building 
measures. 
  Stating that these views were already conveyed to Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative to Cyprus, Denktas pointed out that the Turkish 
Cypriot side had made its position on access to Maras quite 
clear. 
  Recalling that the UN secretary general's report does not 
reflect developments which occurred after 30 May, Denktas 
requested that an addition to the report to include these 
developments.
