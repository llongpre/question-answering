<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Dino Frescobaldi in Geneva; date not given: "My United Nations 
Has Not Failed"; -- first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Geneva -- What is the UN secretary general's reply 
to those who are now putting that international organization in 
the dock? To those who have even called for his resignation? 
We dined on Chinese delicacies with Butrus-Ghali in one of the 
three restaurants of the hotel that stands between the lake and 
the now famous Palace of Nations in Geneva. It was one of his 
rare moments of relaxation in an extremely busy working day. 
  "To start with," Butrus-Ghali began, "the fact that I have 
disagreements with important members of the United Nations 
proves that I am independent and that I try to defend the 
organization's independence and specificity. The United Nations 
is criticized now, but it could not be so before, because it did 
not do anything. We are dealing now with 17 different 
operations worldwide. We have no less than 70,000 troops, and 
our peacekeeping budget has increased from $500 to $4 billion. 
We have increased our activities tenfold. We deal not only with 
conflicts but also with a large number of issues, from the 
environment to health and education. We also deal with the 
democratization process and elections. We sent 2,600 observers 
to South Africa to monitor the elections, and we have been 
working with the local police there since 1992 to contain the 
violence. Of course, we have encountered difficulties in some 
areas, but we have also achieved some successes, as in Cambodia, 
El Salvador, and Mozambique, on the basis of the agreement 
reached in Italy. Even in Somalia we have succeeded in training 
personnel for a police force and in vaccinating 300,000 
children. Let us not forget that 2 million people died in 
Biafra. In Somalia, however, we saved 200,000 children. People 
say that we have failed in Yugoslavia. It is not true: We have 
established a cease-fire between Croats and Serbs in Krajina, 
have helped two million refugees, and have transported millions 
of metric tons of food to Sarajevo. For the first time in the 
history of the United Nations, we have sent troops where there 
is no war -- to Macedonia, within the context of preventive 
diplomacy. It must not be expected that all the operations in 
which the United Nations intervenes must necessarily succeed. 
  [Frescobaldi] Perhaps people's opinions are influenced by 
what happened in Somalia.... 
  [Butrus-Ghali] But everybody should realize now why it was 
so 
difficult there. THE WASHINGTON POST revealed this by 
explaining exactly and at length what happened: There were 
disputes between the various American military chiefs. With 
that happening, we could not impose peace. 
  [Frescobaldi] When you took on your post, did you foresee 
the 
obstacles that you would encounter? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes and no. I was well aware that a new phase 
was beginning in the world, in which we do not yet know what 
rules and new ideas should govern international relations. I 
realized that after the end of the Cold War there was a 
political will on the part of the states to impart a new role to 
the United Nations, but the problem is that the states have not 
yet decided what kind of new role they want it to perform. 
  [Frescobaldi] Are you referring to the only remaining 
superpower? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] That is not true. There is Japan, too. The 
Japanese are divided; we do not know what they want in this 
regard; the public is reluctant to commit itself. I have paid 
three visits to Germany. It is the same there, and the 
responses are the same. And the same goes for Argentina and 
Chile too. If all these states decided to play their part, the 
United Nations really would become an international institution 
with some power. If it is wished to grant it power.... But 
until last January, only 20 of the 184 member states had paid 
their contributions. The United States owes us almost a billion 
dollars. To conclude: There is not the political will on the 
part of the member states to use this instrument. 
  [Frescobaldi] Could you explain? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] First explanation: Many do not yet know what 
the post-Cold War ground rules are. Second, for some states, 
such as America and Russia, it was easy to obtain billions from 
their citizens when there was a clear and specific enemy. Now 
it is much more difficult to achieve a mobilization, when the 
danger is spread round the world. Third, people were prepared 
to die to defend their own territory, but now they are no longer 
prepared to take part in remote operations under a strange flag 
in order to defend other people's peace. 
  [Frescobaldi] Will we reach the establishment of a UN army? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I have never been in favor of it. It would 
entail creating a bureaucracy. What would we do with the 
generals if there were no wars? What I am asking the states to 
do is to have ready a special contingent to be made available 
within 24-48 hours -- a contingent that would return to its own 
ranks once the operation is over. I have proposed a contract to 
Italy to make available, if necessary, five transport aircraft 
belonging to the Italian Armed Forces. I do not doubt that some 
situations would have been resolved if it had been possible to 
intervene within the space of a few days. For instance, I have 
no doubt that if we could have sent 5,000 men to Rwanda within 
48 hours, we would have resolved matters. Now it is taking 
months of exhausting negotiations to decide who will take 
command and to create expedition corps among people that you do 
not know and that change their minds at the last minute. 
  [Frescobaldi] Have these delays also had an impact on the 
situation in Bosnia? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I will tell you in this regard that last June 
I asked to have an additional 10,000 men available. In fact, on 
the basis of a study, I said that 35,000 more men were needed. 
They told me: We will give you 10,000, and that is all. The 
fact is that hitherto I have not managed to secure even these. 
  [Frescobaldi] Did you address Italy, too, in connection with 
Yugoslavia, even though it is a bordering state? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We are in such serious trouble that I 
eventually asked even Italy to participate. Of course, in 
Italy's case there is a danger of reviving old memories, but in 
the present situation it is a lesser danger. I made a choice 
between the two dangers. We cannot do without the quality of 
the Italian troops belonging to NATO, who possess the same 
weapons as the other contingents. 
  [Frescobaldi] What was Italy's reply? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We did not receive a reply; we waited, then 
we 
asked again. We were told that it would be necessary to await 
the election results, and now we have to wait for the new 
government. This is an example. But Italy is not the only 
instance. In Germany they told me that they have constitutional 
problems. So I sent a delegation to the Constitutional Court. 
I then had three hours of discussions with the Bundestag 
Foreign Affairs Committee. For the same reason I have already 
visited Japan twice, and I will go there a third time. All this 
takes up endless time. 
  [Frescobaldi] Do you think that an end to the Yugoslav 
tragedy is possible? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Ethnic war is like a contagious illness that 
spreads and propagates itself. I believe that the United 
Nations has already achieved a great deal by containing the war 
in Bosnia and by preventing it from extending beyond 
Yugoslavia's borders. As for the rest, that will take a long 
time. Unfortunately, I cannot fail to draw a parallel with 
Lebanon. It is difficult to end a tragic process when it has 
claimed so many lives. Beirut too was an important center -- no 
less so than Sarajevo. It was a banking center, a cultural 
center with four universities, a center of information with the 
shaykhs' residences and oil interests. And yet that war has 
lasted 14 years.
