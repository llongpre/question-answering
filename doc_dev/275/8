  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will focus 
on a new plan to help get the confidence-building measures 
accepted and implemented. A Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
correspondent reported from New York that according to 
well-informed sources, the UN secretary general will send 
letters to the two sides in Cyprus explaining the manner to 
implement the confidence-building measures and will refer 
extensively to the benefits for the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  According to the same sources, the UN secretary general will 
proceed with this move if he decides that Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas has given a positive reply to the 21 March UN 
document, based on the briefing by Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus. 
Denktas seems unwilling to accept this procedure, but 
Butrus-Ghali appears determined to send his letters. 
  During their meeting yesterday, the UN secretary general 
informed Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis of his intention. 
The Cypriot delegation at the United Nations is skeptical about 
the effectiveness of the UN secretary general's move and 
expresses the conviction that the impression that Denktas will 
accept the confidence-building measures is an illusion. 
  Mikhailidhis said it is crystal clear in the UN secretary 
general's mind that, despite the course of negotiations on the 
confidence-building measures, the substance of the Cyprus issue 
must be discussed without delay. The foreign minister added that 
the United Nations began forming a picture about the next steps, 
which will be finalized once Feissel's report on his latest 
meeting with Denktas is conveyed. 
  The foreign minister had a one-hour meeting with 
Butrus-Ghali 
in New York and later held separate meetings with the British 
and U.S. permanent UN representatives. Mikhailidhis left New 
York last night to return to Cyprus. He will be in London today 
where he will meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
  The UN secretary general's spokesman, Joe Sills, said that 
all aspects of the Cyprus issue--including the 
confidence-building measures, other substantive issues, and the 
UN secretary general's good offices mission--were discussed at 
the meeting between Butrus-Ghali and the foreign minister. The 
spokesman added that the United Nations continues to feel that 
the confidence-building measures are balanced and offer 
advantages to both sides. 
  Asked if Denktas accepted the confidence-building measures 
during his meeting with Feissel, Sills said the UN secretary 
general is awaiting his representative's briefing.
