   A reorganization at the United Nations has
ended Britain's leading diplomatic role in the Arab-Israeli conflict
and strengthened the control of the U.N. secretary-general over
peacemaking efforts.
   Under the restructuring announced Monday, Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar is taking immediate control over diplomacy
and the arrangement of peace accords, and delegating the
implementation of those accords to senior officials, U.N.
spokeswoman Nadia Younes said.
   She announced the immediate transfer of Undersecretary-General
Marrack Goulding's responsibility for Arab-Israeli problems to Perez
de Cuellar.
   Goulding, a Briton, will now head the Office of Special Political
Affairs, with responsibility solely for peacekeeping operations,
except regarding the U.N. military observers in Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
   The U.N. mediation of the Afghan accords were conducted by Diego
Cordovez of Ecuador, who received credit for that settlement.
   The changes end Britain's longstanding ``portfolio'' for
Arab-Israeli affairs at the United Nations, under which British
officials at the United Nations conducted most diplomacy in the
region.
   The first hint of an impended change in the reviatlized United
Nations came in June when Perez de Cuellar took charge of cease-fire
negotiations between Iran and Iraq. Iran and Iraq agreed to halt
their eight-year war in August, and negotiations over borders and
prisoners are continuing under U.N. auspices.
   Perez de Cuellar, a Peruvian, also personally initiated
negotiations between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish
communities on Cyprus aimed at ending partition of the island.
   Ms. Younes said the secretary-general is making the changes ``in
response to the increasing demand for his good offices in the
maintenance of international peace and security and for United
Nations peacekeeping operations.''
   She declined to characterize the change as a promotion or
demotion.
   Goulding will also be in charge of ``the planning and conduct of
future peacekeeping operations,'' a formidable task with several
potential new missions on the horizon, the spokeswoman said.
