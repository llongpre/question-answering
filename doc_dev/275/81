  [Text] Petaling Jaya, April 22 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
Friday called on United Nations Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to resign for doing nothing to resolve the conflict 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said he was disappointed 
because Butrus-Ghali did not take a firm stand in dealing with 
the Serb aggression in that strife-torn country. 
  The UN should elect a secretary-general who is really an 
activist and brave, who could resolve the problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he told reporters in Subang, here. 
  Mahathir said he believed the resignation of Butrus-Ghali 
would bring change towards settlement of the problem in the 
former Yugoslav republic. 
  What is certain is he did not do anything to settle the 
conflict in Bosnia, he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir expressed regret that Butrus-Ghali took the 
conflict in Bosnia lightly when it erupted more than two years 
ago. 
  At first, Butrus-Ghali said the occurrence in Bosnia could 
be 
found anywhere... He said it was not the only one but there 
were 10 more in other places, he said. 
  Butrus-Ghali's statement appeared to encourage the Serbs to 
continue their aggression against the Bosnian Muslims on the 
grounds that it was not something extraordinary as the same 
thing was happening elsewhere. 
  Asked if Malaysia would play a more important role in the 
election of the UN secretary-general in future, Dr. Mahathir 
said Malaysia's influence was limited in that matter. 
  In fact, he said, many countries were pressured by the big 
powers to elect their candidate to the post. 
  Malaysia did not support Butrus-Ghali's election to the post 
in 1991, he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir reiterated that the Bosnian Muslims should be 
provided with arms to defend themselves from Serb attacks. 
  He believed the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be 
different if the reverse occurred where the people who are 
murdered are non-Muslims and the murderers were Muslims. 
  If this is the situation, I believe action will be taken 
speedily, he said. 
  Meanwhile Gerakan, a component party of the ruling National 
Front, expressed support for the call for Butrus-Ghali's 
resignation. He was biased and racialist in making important 
decisions, party president Dr. Lim Keng Yaik said. 
  Dr. Lim, who is Minister of Primary Industries, said the UN 
was influenced by big powers like the United States and European 
countries and it was uninterested in settling problems in a 
country that did not share the same religious belief or in which 
they had no special interest.
