<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Bizhong (0719 1801 1813): "Kim Yong-nam </F>
Says Signing of Peace Agreement Is Demand of Times"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, 25 Dec (XINHUA)--On 24 December, Kim 
Yong-nam, vice premier and foreign minister of the DPRK State 
Administration Council, arranged a banquet here in honor of Mr 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the United Nations, 
and his entourage. 
  In his speech, Kim Yong-nam mentioned the relationship 
between Korea and the United Nations, and said: The United 
Nations should adopt concrete measures to replace the truce 
agreement with a peace agreement; this has become the demand of 
the times that brooks no delay. Only such practice can be 
commensurate with the new situation in which Korea has become a 
member of the United Nations, and only thus can contributions be 
made to guaranteeing peace and security in the Northeast Asian 
region. He once again stressed the DPRK position on reunifying 
the country in the form of the federal system. 
  Kim Yong-nam reiterated that peacefully resolving the 
nuclear 
problem on the Korean Peninsula by means of dialogue and 
consultations is Korea's constant position. He said: However, 
if the United States disregards Korea's sincerity and continues 
to pursue a hostile policy toward Korea and follow the course of 
exerting pressure, then Korea will have no alternative but to 
adopt resolute measures for safeguarding its state sovereignty. 
  In his speech, Butrus-Ghali said: "I sincerely hope that the 
DPRK and the ROK will have a one-seat representative in the 
United Nations." He said: Realizing permanent peace on the 
Korean peninsula in place of the truce agreement signed in 1953 
is an important matter of concern to the international 
community. If such peace is realized on the Korean peninsula, 
the United Nations will disband the "UN Force Headquarters" on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Butrus-Ghali finally said that he believed the DPRK 
Government and people will make positive contributions to 
international cooperation through the United Nations.
