<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] The Cypriot Government submitted seven proposals to 
the United Nations on the future of the Cyprus issue. Foreign 
Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis is presenting this document during 
his U.S. meetings. According to reports, the foreign minister 
notes that this policy will create the appropriate climate for a 
solution, not the confidence-building measures as the United 
States is suggesting. 
  On the other hand, an effort by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas to appear as if he is accepting the confidence-building 
measures fell apart following a statement-denial by Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special 
representative in Cyprus. UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and the Security Council will decide whether 
Denktas' clarifications are satisfactory. Reports say that the 
occupation leader listed a series of conditions on the document 
that cancel out its acceptance. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis confirmed that a 
document has been sent to the UN Secretariat but avoided 
revealing its contents. Turkish Cypriot newspaper KIBRIS 
yesterday referred extensively to the document, and diplomatic 
sources confirmed to I SIMERINI its validity. The document 
reiterates Nicosia's decision not to resume talks on the 
confidence-building measures and Nicosia's warning that it will 
withdraw its support for the 21 March UN document and promote 
its own reservations. The seven proposals are as 
follows: 

  -  First: The demilitarization of the 
island. 
  -  Second: The issue of guarantees in a future 
solution. 
  -  Third: A UN Security Council reconfirmation that it 
will not accept any decision but one based on one sovereignty, 
nationality, and international image. 
  -  Fourth: An issue of 
demographic changes and a population census. 
  -  Fifth: The Turkish 
troops issue. 
  -  Sixth: An appeal for Turkey to return Famagusta 
according to UN Security Council resolution 550. 
  -  Seventh: An 
appeal by the five UN Security Council permanent representatives 
for European Union representation in the talks. 

  In any case, questions have been raised about yesterday's 
meeting between UN officials and Denktas. In his statement, 
Denktas appeared to have accepted everything. He said: "We 
have accepted the UN demands and they promised to incorporate 
what was agreed in Vienna into the document." Clarifying on 
which positions he had changed, Denktas referred to the issue of 
access to Famagusta's fenced-off area, which remained one of the 
basic obstacles. Denktas said he agreed to move the Turkish 
troops 1 kilometer according to UN wishes, but noted by doing 
this (the Attila) will approach the National Guard positions by 
200 meters. At the same time he agreed to move the "police" 
station from the eastern part of Dherynia Road and that the 
international organization will cover the cost. 
  New York will evaluate Denktas' clarifications (which 
Butrus-Ghali demanded) and decide whether these positions 
constitute an agreement for the talks to continue. In any case 
Feissel described Denktas' clarifications as positive, but as 
soon as his statements became known he was quick to say that it 
is Denktas' personal view that he has accepted the document. He 
even clarified that he made no promises. 
  Feissel had a telephone conversation with the president and 
briefed him on the meeting. According to our information, 
Kliridhis did not want to be informed about Denktas' positions; 
he only wanted to know whether or not he had accepted the 21 
March UN document. Yesterday the government spokesman said that 
Denktas' remarks do not constitute an acceptance of the document 
and added that our side was not told that Denktas' positions 
constitute satisfactory answers. 
  Yesterday, Feissel sent the UN secretary general a report on 
his meeting with Denktas.
