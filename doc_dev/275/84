  [Text] Brussels, Jan 19 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation ordered its military experts here Wednesday [19 
January] to work with the United Nations on final preparations 
for possible air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, diplomats said. 
  But they added that any NATO military action, particularly 
bombing to break the Serb blockade of the mainly-Moslem towns of 
Srebrenica and Tuzla, still depended on a go-ahead from UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  NATO's political executive, the North Atlantic Council 
(NAC), 
met Wednesday to follow through a decision at last week's summit 
of the 16-nation alliance to prepare for bombing raids on Serb 
positions around Srebrenica and Tuzla. 
  Detailed plans for such raids were prepared by commanders of 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) last week and handed to 
Butrus-Ghali in Geneva on Monday. 
  They are now being studied by the UN's special 
representative 
in ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, who must then submit his 
recommendations to the UN and subsequently to NATO. 
  A NATO spokesman said: "The council welcomed the close 
consultations established between NATO and the UN 
secretary-general, and his active and rapid response to the NATO 
(summit) declaration. 
  "The (NAC) meeting agreed that the next steps lie with the 
UN, although the alliance stands ready to provide whatever 
assistance it can," he said. 
  NATO sources said this meant that military experts of the 
alliance would work closely with Akashi on the bombing plans. 
  The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that 
Butrus-Ghali had accepted the "high political priority" of 
planning for NATO intervention and, if necessary, air strikes. 
  The NATO summiteers threatened last week to bomb Serbian 
positions if Serb forces continued to block the relief of 
Canadian peacekeepers at Srebrenica, and the re-opening of Tuzla 
airport which is needed for UN aid missions. 
  Butrus-Ghali has so far been reluctant to authorise the air 
strikes, fearing reprisals against UN forces in Bosnia and 
disagreements in the UN Security Council where Russia is against 
any escalation of the conflict. 
  One diplomat said NATO officials had been working for months 
on detailed plans for military intervention in Bosnia. 
  He said the plans could be put into operation almost 
immediately, pending only last-minute "fine-tuning" to bring 
them into line with specific UN requests. 
  In a related development, the Dutch Defence Ministry said 21 
soldiers are to leave Friday on a reconnaissance mission to 
determine prospects for sending a contingent of troops to 
replace the Canadian forces in Srebrenica. 
  A statement said the 10-day mission would determine when 
some 
1,100 personnel, including an air battalion, could be deployed 
to the eastern Bosnian enclave. 
  A first reconnaissance mission some weeks ago failed to 
produce the necessary information, and UN officials asked the 
Dutch Government to organise a second mission.
