  [Text] The UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus today handed to the two sides in Cyprus the UN's final 
proposal for the implementation of the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. In a statement after his meeting with 
President Glavkos Kliridhis at the Presidential Palace this 
afternoon, Mr. Joe Clark avoided giving a direct answer as to 
whether the Greek Cypriot side has accepted the three basic 
principles set by the United Nations on the CBM's 
implementation. However, he expressed the hope that there will 
be an agreement between the two sides. 
  Mr. Clark noted: Today, I presented the UN's final proposal 
on the CBM's to both leaders and they asked for time to study 
it. Mr. Clark further said that he will meet separately with 
the two leaders tomorrow and expressed the conviction that then 
he will have a clearer idea of where things stand. 
  Asked if there was any reaction by the Greek Cypriot side to 
the plans, Mr. Clark said that he established there is a 
willingness to study the plan before any answer is given. 
Responding to a question whether he expects an answer tomorrow, 
Mr. Clark said that everybody knows that the UN secretary 
general must submit a report to the Security Council at the end 
of March and the report will either refer to an agreement or to 
the failure of the talks. Mr. Clark added that Mr. Butrus-Ghali 
will also have to give the reasons for a possible failure and 
noted that the end of the month is not far away. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the Greek 
Cypriot side will study the whole document, which constitutes an 
amended version of the previous document with more detailed 
references, and adopt a position tomorrow in light of the 
positions taken by the Turkish Cypriot side and the UN secretary 
general's representatives. 
  The spokesman further stressed that the Greek Cypriot side 
does not intend to endlessly exchange documents and demands that 
the Turkish Cypriot side take a clear position on the documents. 
  At his meeting with Rauf Denktas this morning, Mr. Clark 
said 
that the three principles of the new document refer to: 
  First, the acceptance of the need for the existence of a UN 
administration, which should exist because of an agreement 
between the leaders of the two communities. 
  Second, the authority of this administration must be based 
on 
the same system being followed at the United Nations, according 
to which the authority and jurisdictions of the secretary 
general and his envoys stem from the Security Council. 
  Third, there must be clear benefits for both sides.
