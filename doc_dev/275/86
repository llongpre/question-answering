  [Text] Paris, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The commander of UN forces in 
former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot, may be replaced in 
the next few weeks, French officials said here on Monday [17 
January]. 
  A decision on replacing Cot, in command of the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) since July 1, is up to the United Nations, the 
officials said. 
  Cot is at present on leave in France for family reasons. 
  He was reprimanded last week by UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali for stepping out of line by urging NATO airstrikes 
against Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Known for his plain-speaking, Cot made repeated calls for 
special powers to carry out air strikes, whereas under a May 
1993 Security Council resolution only Butrus-Ghali has 
authority to call on North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air 
power. 
  Last week the secretary-general criticised Cot for his 
public 
remarks and for pressuring governments so as to be able to call 
in air strikes. 
  Butrus-Ghali has opposed air strikes for fear of reprisals 
against UN peacekeepers and of disagreements in the Security 
Council where Russia is opposed to any escalation of the 
Yugoslav conflict.
