  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has sent a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali explaining that he cannot 
possibly accept the amended confidence-building measures [CBM] 
package or have it approved by the people of the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. Denktas sent a letter to 
the UN secretary general and reiterated the views of the Turkish 
Cypriot side regarding the CBM package. 
  Recalling that the Turkish Cypriot side is committed to the 
CBM package as it appeared in Butrus-Ghali's report of 1 July 
1993, Denktas expressed his hope that the balance between the 
risks and benefits that was upset in the package will be 
rectified through indirect talks. Stating that he is ready to 
continue with the negotiations and support Butrus-Ghali's 
goodwill mission, Denktas pointed out that having the road 
leading to Maras [Varosha] under UN control was not in the 
initial CBM package and is contrary to the assurances given to 
the Turkish Cypriot side by Butrus-Ghali and his representatives. 
  Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to 
provide the Greek Cypriots safe entry to Maras. Reiterating 
that the lack of trust between the two sides is the real reason 
for the Cyprus problem, Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriots 
would like the embargo imposed on the TRNC eased and the 
citizens of the TRNC given freedom of travel in exchange for the 
opening of the fenced area in Maras. 
  Explaining that he had the initial package approved by the 
Assembly after receiving assurances from the UN representatives 
that there will not be any amendments or additions, Denktas 
added that promises were made regarding the Greek and Turkish 
Cypriots' benefiting simultaneously from the implementation of 
the package. Stating that they were surprised when they were 
informed that items in the 27 March 1994 nondocument that did 
not exist in the original CBM package could not be changed 
later, Denktas stressed that items in Butrus-Ghali's report of 4 
April 1994 differed from those in the already accepted 1 July 
1993 document. 
  In the letter he sent to Butrus-Ghali, Denktas reiterated 
that the Turkish Cypriots are determined regarding the following 
four points: simultaneous benefits to both sides from the 
opening of the Maras and Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airports, air traffic 
arrangements for airplanes using Lefkosa Airport, the issue of 
customs duty at the Maras and Lefkosa Airports, and free access 
to the area between the UN-controlled region and the fenced area 
in Maras. 
  Denktas pointed out that the 11 March 1994 map, which shows 
the area that will be opened in Maras, differs from the 19 May 
1993 map that had been agreed on. Denktas stressed that in the 
wake of all these developments, it will be very difficult for 
him to accept the new package, which was changed by the United 
Nations, and have it approved by the people of the TRNC.
