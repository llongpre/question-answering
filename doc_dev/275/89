  [Text] United Nations, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council adopted a resolution today to empower UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to set up a UN Mozambique Action 
(UNMA) special police detachment, with the number of the members 
of the detachment limited to 1,144. 
  According to Butrus-Ghali's suggestion, this special police 
detachment will begin work as part of the UNMA. In 
Butrus-Ghali's opinion, there is a need for the UNMA to take 
measures to help the Mozambican police improve their ability to 
protect civilians and their property, and to supervise law 
enforcement by the Mozambican police. 
  the Mozambican Government and the Mozambique National 
Resistance signed the "Mozambique comprehensive peace agreement" 
in October 1992 in Rome, Italy, and agreed to hold general 
elections this October. Regrouping and disbanding the two 
factions' troops to create conditions for holding general 
elections and the election preparatory work are under way in 
earnest. 
  Butrus-Ghali held that establishing a special police 
detachment to supervise law enforcement by the Mozambican police 
will help build voter confidence and prevent irregularities. 
  Li Zhaoxing, China's permanent representative to the United 
Nations, spoke prior to putting the resolution to a vote. He 
said that the international community, including the United 
Nations, should continue to try its best to help the Mozambican 
people realize the goal of holding the general elections as 
scheduled so as to help Mozambique return to the path of 
rebuilding its homeland and restoring its economy.
