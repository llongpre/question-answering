  [Text] United Nations, April 29 (XINHUA) -- 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today expressed concern at 
the "persistence of the deadlock in the efforts to restore 
democracy in Haiti" as well as the human rights situation in the 
country. 
  Having reviewed the situation with his special 
representative 
for Haiti, Dante Caputo, the U.N. chief reiterated that "it is 
essential that the restoration of democracy be the result of an 
agreement by the Haitian parties," a U.N. spokesman said today. 
  A draft Security Council resolution on Haiti, worked out by 
the United States and being circulated among diplomats here, 
gives Haitian military authorities 15 days to resign or leave 
the country. Otherwise, they will face much tougher sanctions. 
  According to the Governor's Island treaty signed between 
exile Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Haitian Army 
chief Raoul Cedras last July, the president should have returned 
to his country by the end of the following October. 
  But Aristide cannot do so because the military authorities 
failed to observe the accord they themselves signed. 
  The secretary-general has asked Caputo to "continue to 
analyze the situation closely and to report back to him soon," 
and will report to the General Assembly this week, the spokesman 
said.
