  [Text] Lefkose, April 5 (A.A.) -- Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas described the 
report of UN secretary general on Cyprus as `realistic' on 
Tuesday [6 April]. 
  "The report is realistic in statements on the concerns of 
the 
Turkish side and on the continuation of negotiations," Denktas 
said. "However, the finger is still pointing to the Turkish 
side." 
  Denktas answered questions of the press on the report of 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, which evaluates the 
shuttle talks held by his envoys with the Turkish and Greek 
Cypriot leaders, on the confidence-building measures formulated 
by the United Nations. 
  Denktas said that the original confidence-building measures 
contained arrangements which safeguarded the rights of both 
sides. 
  "The changes made on the measures, gives priority and rights 
to Greek Cypriots and spoils the position of the Turkish Cypriot 
side," he said. 
  Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriot side was ready to 
resume talks, to resolve the Cyprus issue. 
  He stressed that Butrus-Ghali should not expect the Turkish 
Cypriot side to accept the `non-document document' of March 21, 
of Ghali, which modified the confidence-building measures 
package. 
  "The promises which have been made to us, do not render our 
gains concrete," he said. 
  "The second document is unacceptable to us in many points," 
he said. "If a message, which says, `I will put pressures on the 
Turks' is given, then why should the Greek Cypriots change its 
position?" 
  He added that if an agreement is reached between the sides, 
the Greek Cypriots will be allowed to enter the currently 
uninhabited section of TRNC within four months, while Turks will 
be allowed in after 12 months. 
  "What if Greek Cypriots violate the agreement meanwhile?" he 
asked. 
  The UN-formulated confidence-building measures originally 
envisaged to place the Maras [Varosha] section of the TRNC under 
UN control and open the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport to 
international traffic. 
  Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a 
peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup 
attempt to annex the island to Greece. 
  The TRNC came into existence in 1983.
