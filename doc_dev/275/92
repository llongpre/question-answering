  [Text] A provision on the confidence-building measures has 
been included in a modified draft UN Security Council resolution 
on the renewal of the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate in 
Cyprus. Specifically, the draft resolution stresses the urgent 
need to implement the confidence-building measures that are 
mentioned in UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report 
on the Cyprus issue dated 1 July 1993. 
  The draft resolution, which suggests the renewal of the 
UNFICYP mandate for another six months, mentions that the UN 
Security Council will reconsider the situation in Cyprus, 
specifically the role of the United Nations, within the 
framework of the UN secretary general's report of 30 May 1994. 
  The draft resolution calls on both sides to commit 
themselves 
to significantly reducing the number of foreign troops that are 
in the Republic of Cyprus and to reduce defense spending to help 
restore confidence, which is the first step toward the 
withdrawal of all non-Cypriot forces as provided in 
Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas. 
  The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reported 
from New York that the draft resolution will be presented for 
approval to the Security Council either today or tomorrow.
