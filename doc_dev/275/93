  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the 
Cypriot Government believes that the procedure followed so far 
by the United Nations to promote a Cyprus solution has failed 
because of the lack of political will by the Turkish side. It 
also believes that the time has come for the UN Security Council 
to consider alternative ways to promote the problem. 
  The spokesman clarified that when he refers to the procedure 
he means the one on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] and 
all the others followed in the past to promote the sets of ideas 
from former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Kasoulidhis added that 
the president has some thoughts on ways to promote the Cyprus 
issue and will submit them to the National Council after the UN 
secretary general submits his report. 
  Answering a question, the spokesman said the government does 
not believe that a silent deadline has been given to the entire 
procedure but that it is merely a delay. He added that the 
Cypriot Government has not asked for new meetings with Joe 
Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus, or Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate 
special representative in Cyprus, during this period. 
Kasoulidhis said: The government does understand what can be 
said in such meetings, unless Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas changes his position and that side accepts the UN 
document of 21 March. Our side has no margins for further 
negotiations on this document. 
  Asked about information that Clark will resign, that a 
replacement will be appointed, or that observers will be 
appointed to the Cyprus issue the spokesman said the government 
has no information.
