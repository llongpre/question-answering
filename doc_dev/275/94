  [Text] Geneva 8 May TASS -- "Since the Commonwealth is now 
officially recognized and has the status of observer in the 
United Nations, this means that the CIS should take an active 
part in all processes developing in the world community," said 
CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotechnya, who visited the U.N. 
European branch earlier this week. 
  Summing up the results of his visit in an interview with 
TASS, Korotechnya noted that the point at issue was actually 
"participation by the CIS, in the capacity of observer, in all 
meetings of international organizations having their 
representative offices in Geneva." This would enable the 
Commonwealth to spell out its vision of certain issues at the 
international level and to express its position on these issues. 
  During his trip to Geneva, Korotechnya signed on behalf of 
the CIS secretariat an agreement on cooperation with the 
secretariat of the U.N. Conference for Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD), held talks with executive secretary of the European 
Economic Commission Yves Berthelot and Director General of the 
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arpad Bogsch. 
  "The agreement with the UNCTAD defines directions for 
further 
joint work and mutual interests," the CIS executive secretary 
said, referring to regular consultations, exchange of 
information, technical assistance. The visit to the European 
Economic Commission laid the foundation for further cooperation. 
As for the WIPO, a meeting is scheduled to be held in the 
Belarusian capital Minsk in a month and a half, which is to draw 
plenipotentiary envoys of CIS member-countries and to be 
attended by Bogsch. The meeting is to concentrate on 
coordination in protection of intellectual property rights. 
  "The recognition by the United Nations of the CIS as a 
regional association prompted us to approve at our latest 
meeting in Moscow a plan of measures aiming to develop 
international contacts," Korotechnya reported. The recent visit 
by U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to the CIS 
headquarters in Minsk proved to the United Nations' interest in 
cooperation with the CIS. "I do not rule out that in prospect a 
representative office of the CIS as a whole will be set up in 
Geneva," the executive secretary noted. "But for this, we need a 
decision by the council of heads of government or of heads of 
state," he added. 
  At present, each of the newly-independent states is 
establishing ties with U.N. structures separately, and yet "we 
are also looked at as the Commonwealth on the whole," 
Korotechnya pointed out. Orienting itself for international 
contacts, the CIS secretariat does not intend by any means "to 
influence any bilateral ties": All CIS member-countries have 
the right to choose their partners on their own. The point at 
issue is just cooperation that could be profitable for the 
entire Commonwealth. 
  At the latest meeting of CIS heads of state and government 
in 
Moscow, "we took a serious step towards consolidation and 
strengthening of the Commonwealth," the CIS executive secretary 
said. "We have reached the level of Commonwealth when the 
member-states are gathering at the table not just to sign some 
document," he emphasised. At the same time, all states are 
sovereign, therefore we should search for a consensus when 
solving our problems. "We should take counsel and reach 
agreement -- this is the main essence of the Commonwealth. This 
is perhaps the core of democracy and of all processes currently 
underway in our society," Korotechnya pointed out.
