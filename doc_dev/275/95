    [Editorial Report] Greek-language Nicosia dailies on 2 June 
carry commentaries on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
report to the Security Council on the outcome of negotiations on 
the confidence-building measures which was released 1 June. 
  Pro-Democratic Rally ALITHIA carries a 650-word commentary 
on 
page one entitled, "Implementing the Butrus-Ghali Report," which 
the writer describes as satisfactory in its description of 
events. However, the writer notes: "The second part of 
Butrus-Ghali's report with the five alternatives he suggests to 
the Security Council may not be considered a dramatic cure with 
radical (depending on the seriousness of the interpretation) 
measures, but it is a prescription based on the recognition of 
the other side's responsibility for the impasse." The writer 
discusses the first option, which is the withdrawal of the 
United Nations from Cyprus, and notes that this would be unfair 
for the weaker side, the Greek Cypriot side. He adds: "The UN 
secretary general's alternatives may not be absolutely 
satisfactory, but they offer our side the possibility to demand 
safety and security in accordance with the principles of 
international law and the UN Charter. Besides the fact that 
Butrus-Ghali suggests alternatives, he leaves no doubt as to 
which can be implemented and productive. At the same time, he 
does not avoid the extreme suggestion of exerting pressure on 
the other side by taking steps so that it will accept the 
confidence-building measures." The writer concludes: "The most 
positive aspect of the report is that it condemns the other 
side's firm negative stance. It objectively describes reality 
and makes the Security Council aware of its responsibilities. 
It is a report on wise use and not irresponsible rejection." 
  The conservative, nationalist I SIMERINI carries a 700-word 
editorial on page one entitled, "Disengagement Now" in which the 
writer says that following a "scandalous" tolerance toward 
Denktas, the UN secretary general was "forced" to blame the 
Turkish side for the impasse. The writer says: "Expressions 
like, `the situation is not satisfactory,' `there is no 
political will for a solution,' and `we should search for new 
processes,' muddies the waters and actually attributes blame 
where it does and does not belong. The blame for the outcome of 
the latest negotiating effort is placed on Denktas, but there is 
an attempt to create the impression that everyone is responsible 
since, for 30 years `it has been proven that there is no 
political will for a solution.' The UN secretary general 
proposed five alternatives on which the Security Council is 
called upon to decide. The very first `option' is a punishment 
for the victim, which is the Greek Cypriot side!" The writer 
says that this is not a new proposal but one that first came to 
light two years ago, and concludes: "If there is time and 
willingness to muddle along and make a new mockery, it does not 
depend on us. Because, let us not kid ourselves, the backstage 
now promotes a `new beginning' with another framework and pseudo 
names for the same things, and with new deadlines and new 
wishful promises. Anyone who wants to can get tangled deeper by 
assuming political and historical responsibility." 
  The independent O AGON carries a 300-word commentary on page 
four entitled, "The Post-Report Period." The writer says that 
following the long-awaited report, everyone now wonders what 
will happen with the secretary general's suggestions. The 
writer says: "Unfortunately, the placement of blame on the 
Turkish Cypriot side is not accompanied with clear views on how 
to bend Denktas' intransigence. The five options for 
alternative actions submitted by Butrus-Ghali cannot be 
considered positive because they either turn against our side 
(withdrawal of UNFICYP, UN Forces in Cyprus) or limit the Cyprus 
issue to the confidence-building measures and a plan." The 
writer concludes with the following: "We want to believe that 
our side will not waste time in a never-ending discussion over 
the positive and negative points of the Butrus-Ghali report. We 
want to believe that this time with what we have learned from 
the process we will enact a policy different from the ones that 
only lead us to `descriptive reports.'" 
  KHARAVYI, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party AKEL, 
carries 
its commentary in the 400-word "Controversy" column by "Arkanis" 
(pseudo name for the writer) on page one under the headline, "A 
First Evaluation." The writer says the UN secretary general's 
report justifies AKEL's positions and dissolves the Kliridhis 
Government's illusions about alternative plans of action. He 
adds: "The most substantive part of the UN secretary general's 
report is the one that talks about how to proceed. This part of 
the report is also dissatisfying because, despite the fact that 
it stresses the Turkish intransigence, the five points of the 
Butrus-Ghali proposals to the Security Council on how to proceed 
are not the ones that our side would have liked." He says: 
"The UN secretary general's report justifies AKEL's position 
for return to the substance of the Cyprus issue based on a plan 
and map, and the implementation of alternative actions that will 
force the Turkish side to withdraw its unacceptable conditions 
on substance and adjusts its positions based on the Butrus-Ghali 
proposals." The writer concludes: "Unfortunately for our side, 
the developments fully justify the positions of AKEL. Perhaps 
the direction of developments could have been different if 
AKEL's views and suggestions regarding Security Council 
Resolution 789 were taken into consideration and not destroyed 
to serve election expediencies. The way out of today's situation 
is offered only through our proposal for a return to the 
substance of the Cyprus issue."
