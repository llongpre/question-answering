  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has 
suggested that the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate be 
renewed for another six months. In his report, which circulated 
tonight, the UN secretary general mentions that UNFICYP's 
presence is still necessary to achieve the Security Council's 
goals. 
  The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reports 
from New York that the UN secretary general is concerned with 
the lack of progress in the reduction of troops and armaments in 
Cyprus. He blames the Turkish side for the fact that talks have 
not begun on disarmament in Cyprus and on prohibition of using 
arms along the buffer zone other than sidearms. Butrus-Ghali 
also mentions that concern for the lack of progress in this 
sector intensifies if one considers the lack of political will 
that was apparent in the latest efforts to agree on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  The UN secretary general adds in his report that he has 
informed Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of President 
Glavkos Kliridhis' demilitarization proposal. Butrus-Ghali says 
that the Turkish Government replied that the Turkish Cypriot 
community is the appropriate party to decide on that proposal. 
He also mentions that military equipment on both sides in 
Cyprus has been upgraded and that the number of Turkish troops 
on the island has risen to 30,000. The UN peacekeeping force in 
Cyprus numbers 1,250 men, 110 less than the number provided for.
