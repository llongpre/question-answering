  [Text] Brussels, Jan 20 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem leader 
Alija Izetbegovic was told on Thursday at NATO headquarters in 
Brussels that the Western alliance would intervene in the 
Bosnian civil war only at the request of the United Nations. 
  Izetbegovic, who was meeting NATO Deputy Secretary-General 
Amadeo de Franchihis, reiterated the Moslem position for 
resolving the conflict in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as presented at the peace talks in Geneva, a 
NATO spokesman told TANJUG. 
  The peace talks ended on Wednesday without any concrete 
results because Bosnian Moslems again rejected an 
internationally drawn peace plan although the representatives of 
the other two Bosnian nations -- the Serbs and the Croats -- had 
met European demands for ensuring to the Moslems one-third of 
the territory. 
  The NATO spokesman said de Franchihis once again confirmed 
that NATO was ready to contribute to implementing any Bosnia 
peace agreement and help plan any action demanded by the United 
Nations. 
  The spokesman refused to comment on the details of 
Izetbegovic's meeting with de Franchihis save for saying that it 
was informative in nature and that Izetbegovic's visit to 
Brussels was private in character and organized at his request. 
  U.N. General-Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali said on Thursday 
he had not received any requests for a military intervention in 
Bosnia and that he could not decide alone on that issue, but 
only in consultations with the Security Council. Butrus-Ghali 
was officially reminded of this by Russia, one of the five 
Security Council members with veto powers, which opposes the use 
of force in Bosnia. 
  Diplomats say that special U.N. envoy in ex-Yugoslavia 
Jasushi Akashi said in a report to the secretary-general he was 
explicitely against the use of NATO troops for a military 
intervention in Bosnia. 
  Well-informed sources say Akashi has established that the 
Serbs are willing to allow the replacement of Canadian U.N. 
peace-keepers in the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica in eastern 
Bosnia, and that the reopening of the airport in 
Moslem-controlled Tuzla is not so urgent because humanitarian 
convoys can reach the area by land. 
  At its summit in Brussels ten days ago, NATO threatened to 
mount air strikes against Bosnian Serbs who the Western military 
alliance alleged would not allow the replacement of the U.N. 
troops in Srebrenica and reopening of Tuzla airport.
