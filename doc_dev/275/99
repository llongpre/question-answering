  [Text] New York, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Only a few hours 
after Bosnian Moslem presidency President Ejup Ganic, to his own 
admittance, "implored and begged" the U.N. secretary-general to 
do something about Gorazde, Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO 
Secretary- General Manfred Woerner to mount air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions. 
  The Russians were again not consulted and this caused a very 
angry reaction of Russian U.N. Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsev. 
  Following Butrus-Ghali's announcement, Vorontsev stormed out 
of the Security Council session saying that air strikes could 
not be launched without approval of the Security Council and 
that otherwise the U.N. would be directly involved in the 
Bosnian war on the Moslem side. 
  Senior reporters at U.N. headquarters say they have not seen 
such reaction from Russia since the time of the Cold War. 
  Vorontsev argued that although air support to U.N. troops on 
the ground was "the sacred duty" of the world organization, air 
strikes were something completely different because they would 
automatically draw the U.N. in war operations, not only in the 
air, but on the ground too. 
  The United Nations should decide whether it wants war or 
mediation and the Security Council should rule on this matter, 
said Vorontsev. 
  Those who support air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions 
maintain that the U.N. does not need special authorization of 
the Security Council to launch the strikes and invoke Resolution 
836 of June 8, 1993 to support their position. 
  Para 10 of Resolution 836 says that U.N. member-nations, 
individually or through regional organizations and arrangements, 
can undertake, under the authority of the Security Council and 
in close cooperation with the secretary-general and the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR), all the necessary measures, 
including the use of air power in and around the U.N.-designated 
"safe areas" in Bosnia- Herzegovina, to support UNPROFOR in 
carrying out its mandate. 
  A heated debate will probably ensue in the Security Council 
about the interpretation of this provision. 
  Butrus-Ghali and the majority of the council members believe 
that the provision gives them a free hand. The Russians, for 
their part, could come out with a counterargument that the word 
"authority" in the text stands for special approval of the 
Security Council, which could create an impasse. 
  Vorontsev's argument that it is completely wrong for the 
United Nations to become involved in the Bosnian war on the side 
of only one of the belligerents may finally prevail. "This is 
our position and we will strongly defend it," Vorontsev was 
categorical.
