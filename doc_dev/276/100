   ``Cadillac Man'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.98. Rated R)
   
   Robin Williams may well be in agreement with the Los Angeles
Lakers on the proposition that you can't win them all.
   Coming off Academy Award nominations for ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' and ``Dead Poets Society,'' it appeared the hyper comic
could do no wrong. Alas, he throws a piston with ``Cadillac Man.''
   Williams is far too inventive a performer to fail completely.
But his protean talents are straitjacketed as Joey O'Brien, a
charmless, sex-crazy car salesman whose redemption comes too late.
   ``Cadillac Man'' begins promisingly. Under the titles, a
helicopter shot focuses on the New York skyline, then across an
endless landscape of gravestones. On the edge of the cemetery, a
funeral procession is stalled by a disabled hearse.
   Enter Joey, who sells cars with the zeal of Michael Milken
peddling junk bonds. He befriends the mortician and presents a
card. When he tries the same with the widow (Elaine Stritch in a
funny bit), she calls him a sleaze.
   That's what he is, all right. Joey will say anything to sell a
car. Meanwhile, he tries to service two mistresses - one a married
woman (Fran Drescher), the other a ditsy would-be designer
(Annabella Sciorra), placate his ex-wife (Pamela Reed) and stay out
of the clutches of a debt-collecting mafia boss (Bill Nelson). Joey
also faces an impossible sales quota or he's fired.
   The tedium of Joey's travails ends with a crash: Tim Robbins
smashes the showroom door with his cycle. He brandishes an
automatic weapon, madly seeking the lover of his wife, who works at
the agency.
   Are hostage situations a likely source of comedy? After watching
the nightly news you might not think so. Williams and Robbins
strive mightily to make it work, and almost succeed. The rangy,
wild-eyed Robbins, impressive as the feckless minor leaguer in
``Bull Durham,'' somehow ingratiates as the reluctant terrorist.
   The two stars and the large supporting cast get little help from
Ken Friedman's lusterless script or from Roger Donaldson's
haphazard direction. The filmmakers seem to believe that loud is
funny. It ain't.
