<HEAD>Cost of Pictures Means Little to Academy Voters</HEAD>

   Here's proof that Academy voters pay little
heed to what a movie costs: One of the contenders for best picture
was produced for $3 million, another for $8 million.
   Contrast those figures with the $50 million spent on ``Batman,''
which earned one Academy Award nomination _ for art direction.
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has a history of
ignoring the cost factor in rewarding the best achievements of the
film world. ``Marty,'' with a budget of $343,000, won as best
picture of 1955, beating such big-budget films as ``Picnic,''
``Mister Roberts'' and ``Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing.''
   The $1-million ``Rocky'' knocked out its rivals in 1976. Other
low-budget winners: ``Chariots of Fire,'' 1981, and ``Platoon,''
1986.
   Oscar loves the Cinderella story, and this year it stars the
Irish-made drama ``My Left Foot.''
   ``We managed to get the picture made out of blind ignorance,''
admits producer Noel Pearson. ``We were two weeks into filming when
we lined up the financing.'' He had been a close friend of the
film's subject, hard-drinking Christy Brown, who became an
acclaimed artist and writer in spite of the cerebral palsy that
virtually immobilized him.
   Pearson started the film with his own money, plus 100,000 pounds
sterling apiece from a friend and from Irish television. Everyone
concerned with the film, including star Daniel Day-Lewis, worked
for bare minimum. An art gallery scene was filmed in Pearson's own
house. He borrowed costumes from his theatrical company.
   ``The film was made for just under $3 million, depending on the
rate of exchange,'' said the producer. ``We managed to do that
because everybody was committed. It was triumph of spirit over
financing.'' The latest estimate for the worldwide gross of ``My
Left Foot'' _ $50 million.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' also demonstrates that a film's budget is
immaterial at awards time. It was budgeted at $8 million, amazing
in view of the $20 million average for mainstream Hollywood films.
   How could Richard and Lili Zanuck produce such an inexpensive
film? It is basically a two-character story and the two stars,
Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, are not high-priced. Dan Aykroyd
is, but he took a lesser salary to play the straight role of the
old woman's son. His change of character paid off with a nomination
for supporting actor.
   Australian Bruce Beresford directed ``Driving Miss Daisy'' on
locations in and around Atlanta and the Zanucks tightly budgeted
the locations. The film, about the long relationship between a
cranky widow and her patient chauffeur, has proved a huge hit, both
in awards (nine Oscar nominations, the most this year), and at the
box office ($60.3 million after 12 weeks in release).
   Two other nominees for best picture had average budgets and drew
mixed reviews, but their off-beat subjects somehow connected with
the moviegoing public.
   ``Field of Dreams'' invited audiences to swallow a whopper: that
an Iowa farmer would build a baseball diamond in his cornfield
where long-dead major leaguers would play.
   Many critics spurned the fantasy, but ticket buyers were
attracted by its message of hope and the star power of Kevin
Costner. Filmed for a reported $16 million, ``Field of Dreams''
amassed a gross of $63 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' looked like an impossible sell. The title
seemed a turnoff. Although Robin Williams was a hot draw in the
wake of ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' he played a relatively brief
role as the English teacher who inspires students at a 1960s boys
school to think creatively. Most of the screen time in the $20
million film was devoted to the cast of unknown teen-agers.
   Reviewers objected to Williams as a latter-day Mr. Chips and
found the tragic ending out of keeping with the rest of the film.
But ``Dead Poets Society,'' directed by another Australian, Peter
Weir, sold $94 million in theater tickets.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' proved that film audiences are
still concerned with the consequences of the Vietnam war. The film
was the result of a long collaboration between Oliver Stone, whose
``Platoon'' was drawn from his own experiences in the war, and Ron
Kovic, wounded veteran and anti-war activist. Tom Cruise, one of
today's biggest draws in films, and strong reviews helped
contribute to the success of ``Born on the Fourth of July'' _ $59.7
million in 10 weeks.
   Stone directed the film in the Philippines, which doubled for
both Vietnam and Mexico, and Dallas, which represented Kovic's home
town of Massapequa, N.Y. Despite the complex production, which
ranged from battlefields to national political conventions with
12,000 extras, the cost was reportedly $18 million.
