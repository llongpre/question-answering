   A disabled Marine, an old woman's chauffeur,
a cerebral palsy victim, an English teacher and a king of England _
these are the widely divergent characterizations nominated by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the best
performance by an actor in 1989.
   Rarely has the Oscar race offered such a range of portrayals,
making perilous any predictions of the winner on March 26. Daniel
Day-Lewis and Tom Cruise have been termed the favorites, but it's
still anybody's guess.
   An Oscar for Cruise would reward a star who is already on top of
the Hollywood heap. After four smash hits in a row _ ``The Color of
Money,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``Cocktail'' and ``Rain Man''_ he is the
actor studios want most.
   Cruise took a chance with ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
devoting painful months to portray Ron Kovic, the paraplegic
Vietnam veteran who became an anti-war activist.
   ``Tom worked for nothing for 18 months to make this picture
happen,'' says director Oliver Stone. ``He came from the same
background as Ron: working class, Catholic upbringing. He was
motivated by the same desires to be the best at what he does, to be
a champion.''
   In an interview Cruise said of his role: ``I'd like people to
see that Kovic is not simply a victim. Instead, he creates his life
every day in the face of more difficulty than most of us have
experienced. That was crucial for me to understand: that we have to
fight back when we meet adversity.''
   Christy Brown's adversity seemed insuperable. Born into a large,
poor Dublin family, his cerebral palsy made control of his body
impossible _ except for his left foot. Yet he managed to become an
acclaimed artist and writer.
   Daniel Day-Lewis, last seen as the libertine surgeon in ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' undertook the punishing role in
``My Left Foot.'' The son of a one-time poet laureate of England
and an actress, Day-Lewis spent time in a Dublin clinic studying
how children with cerebral palsy coped with their handicaps.
   ``It became very important to me that it didn't become a film
about a supposedly able-bodied actor taking on the physical
manifestations of this supposedly disabled man,'' the actor says.
``That seemed to me of secondary importance.''
   Morgan Freeman, who won an Academy nomination as supporting
actor with his vicious pimp in ``Street Smart,'' plays a far
different role in ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' He is the patient,
understanding chauffeur for a cantankerous Southern Jewish woman,
Jessica Tandy. Freeman, who spent his early years in Greenwood,
Miss., had no trouble understanding the role of a black man in the
postwar South.
   ``Having grown up in the South, I knew this man,'' he said. ``I
don't think of him as being `subservient.' You live in a certain
society, and that society has rules, and you abide by them. You can
always do that with a certain amount of dignity.''
   Freeman had the advantage of originating the role of Hoke in the
off-Broadway version of Alfred Uhry's play. ``This character was
totally realized on paper,'' Freeman remarks. ``There was little
for me to do but slip into it and do it.''
   For Kenneth Branagh, having played ``Henry V'' in the theater
was a distinct advantage. He was directing as well as starring in
the film version.
   ``Since I had already played the role with the Royal Shakespeare
Company,'' says the Belfast-born Branagh, ``it was in the blood.
When I did a take, it was like a release; all I had to do was be
the character. I could use the medium as spontaneously as if Henry
was a modern figure.
   ``As soon as I finished the take, I had to face questions about
the costumes, the lighting and whatever. If I had not been familiar
with the role, it would have been terrifying.''
   ``Dead Poets Society'' provided an ideal vehicle for Robin
Williams, allowing him to use his quicksilver wit within the
context of a drama. He plays John Keating, a teacher who cajoles
the students at a 1960s boys school to unshackle their
imaginations. The film was entirely different when presented to
Williams by director Peter Weir.
   ``The first draft had the whole thing where Keating was dying of
cancer and that's why he was coming back and doing one last good
deed before he died,'' the actor said in an interview. ``It would
be real melodramatic that way, like `Love Story.' It was too much.
Let's focus on the boys, let's make their story stronger. And
(Weir) did just that.
   ``It's not about one man against the system. ... It's about one
man coming with some ideas and boys taking them and going off in
every direction.''
   Williams' suggestion cut down his role to what some actors would
consider a supporting part. But the impact of his personality was
strong enough to prompt academy voters to give him a second
nomination as best actor. His first was for ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' in 1987.
