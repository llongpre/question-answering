   ``My Left Foot'' star Daniel Day-Lewis ran
jubilant through the streets of London and ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' screenwriter Ron Kovic beamed triumphant after hearing
Wednesday's list of Oscar nominees.
   Telephones worldwide rang in the good, and sometimes
disappointing, news of Academy Award nominations announced here at
a pre-dawn news conference.
   ``Unbelievable! We'll have to celebrate,'' a groggy Dan Aykroyd
told his publicist when she called him at 5:35 a.m. with word of
his ``Driving Miss Daisy'' supporting actor nod. ``Now, I'm going
back to sleep.''
   Most nominees expressed elation. But filmmaker Spike Lee
complained that his ``Do the Right Thing'' deserved more than two
nominations.
   ``In a little way I'm happy, in a little way I'm disappointed,''
said screenplay nominee Lee, whose movie also got a supporting
actor nod for Danny Aiello. ``We got jerked out of best director,
best film, I think my cinematographer did a great job, I think my
editor did a great job. ... I know in my heart that my father, Bill
Lee, deserved a nomination for best score.''
   He ended the telephone interview from New York with, ``We wuz
robbed,'' spelling out ``W-U-Z.''
   Tom Cruise was working on a movie in Florida and Robin Williams
was on location in New York when they learned of their best actor
nominations. Oliver Stone was in Los Angeles casting his next
movie, ``The Doors.''
   Morgan Freeman was on his boat and couldn't be reached for
comment on his best actor nomination for ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   Kovic, who wrote the ``Born on the Fourth of July'' screenplay
with Oliver Stone and whose life is portrayed in the movie, was
told about the film's eight nominations moments before he boarded a
plane in New York.
   ``I consider it a tremendous honor to be nominated by members of
the academy for best screenplay,'' he said. ``This is truly one of
the happiest and most triumphant moments of my life.''
   Stone's reaction was subdued.
   ``I am very happy that my colleagues have acknowledged `Born on
the Fourth of July' in a year with so many fine films. It's also
most gratifying to know people are seeing it and being moved by
it,'' Stone said.
   Williams was in New York filming ``Awakenings'' with Robert
DeNiro when his publicist telephoned him with news of his best
actor nomination for ``Dead Poets Society.''
   ``I am absolutely thrilled and delighted that the Academy
remembered the director, the screenwriter, the picture and all the
poets,'' the actor said.
   Pauline Collins learned of her ``Shirley Valentine'' best
actress nomination on cable television's CNN broadcast in Madrid.
   ``Isn't it lovely? To me, `Shirley' began as a lovely job to do
in England, and now all this _ it really is quite extraordinary,''
she said.
   Producer Noel Pearson, whose ``My Left Foot'' got five
nominations, including best picture, said from London that he was
stunned.
   The movie's best actor nominee, Day-Lewis, was exhilarated. He
ran out in the street when he heard the news at his agent Julian
Belfrage's office.
   ``He's so thrilled. He's just run out of the building. At the
moment, it's madness in here,'' Pearson said. Day-Lewis couldn't be
corralled for an interview.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Phil Alden Robinson, nominated for his
``Field of Dreams'' screenplay. ``My 40th birthday is in a couple
weeks and this will make turning 40 a little easier.''
   He said the film about reconciliation and renewal on a baseball
field has already delivered its rewards to him.
   ``We got letters from people saying the film had changed their
lives, that it had brought families back together. We couldn't have
asked for more than that,'' he said.
