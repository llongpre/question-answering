   Five top contenders for U.S. Oscars won British
academy awards Sunday, with the American drama ``Dead Poets
Society'' named best film of 1989.
   Pauline Collins was named best actress for her portrayal in
``Shirley Valentine'' of a housewife who escapes boredom in
Liverpool and finds fulfillment in Greece. Miss Collins, giving her
thanks, said it was a brave decision ``to put a middle-aged
unknown'' in a major film.
   Daniel Day Lewis took best actor honors for his portrayal of
crippled Irish writer Christy Brown in ``My Left Foot.'' Accepting
the award from actress Angela Lansbury, Day Lewis expressed his
``lasting admiration'' for the late writer.
   Kenneth Branagh was named best director for ``Henry V,'' in
which he played the title role. The 29-year-old actor had also been
nominated for best actor.
   American writer Nora Ephron walked off with the award for best
original screenplay for ``When Harry Met Sally,'' a comedy about a
decade-long friendship that turns into love.
   ``Dead Poets Society,'' the story of an inspirational
boarding-school teacher played by Robin Williams, beat ``My Left
Foot,'' ``Shirley Valentine'' and ``When Harry Met Sally'' for the
best film award.
   In addition, Maurice Jarre's music for ``Dead Poets Society''
was honored for best original film score.
   Miss Collins, Day Lewis, Branagh, Ephron and the ``Dead Poets
Society'' have been nominated for Academy Awards, which will be
announced in Los Angeles next Monday.
   The British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards films
released in Britain in 1989. Oscar hopefuls such as ``Driving Miss
Daisy,'' ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``The Fabulous Baker
Boys'' did not open in time to be considered.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' a 1988 Oscar nominee, received 10
British nominations and won two awards: Michelle Pfeiffer was named
best supporting actress for her portrayal of the virtuous woman led
astray and Christopher Hampton won for best adapted screenplay.
   In the U.S. Oscars, Miss Pfeiffer is nominated as best actress
for her role as a nightclub singer in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   Irish actor Ray McAnally won a posthumous award as best
supporting actor for his role as Christy Brown's father in ``My
Left Foot,'' his final film role before he died last year. The
choice was greeted with cheers.
   The best film in a foreign language was Frenchman Bertrand
Tavernier's ``Life and Nothing But'' about the emotional havoc
wrought by World War I.
   A host of celebrities from both sides of the Atlantic attended
the black-tie awards ceremony at the Grosvenor House Hotel.
   The celebrity presenters included actors Sean Connery, William
Hurt and Ben Kingsley. Actress Jodie Foster was also a presenter.
   Princess Anne, president of the British Academy, presented its
Special Award for 1990 to Dame Peggy Ashcroft, 82, for her dominant
role in British show business for half a century.
   The princess also presented a special award for outstanding
British contribution to cinema to veteran director Lewis Gilbert,
70. His latest film was ``Shirley Valentine.''
   In television categories, the best actress award went to Diana
Rigg for her role as the obsessive, homicidal mother in ``Mother
Love.''
   The best actor award was given to John Thaw for his work as
``Inspector Morse,'' a sour, crossword-loving detective from Oxford.
