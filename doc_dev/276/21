   Samuel F. Pickering Jr. is not above telling
a lie to make a good story better, and he encourages the students in
his writing course to do the same.
   ``You've got to lie to give the illusion of truth,'' the English
professor tells his students at the University of Connecticut.
   Given that philosophy, it's not surprising that Pickering finds
himself caught up in the excitement over a bit of fiction written by
a former student. The teacher John Keating, played by Robin Williams
in the movie ``Dead Poets Society,'' is modeled after Pickering.
   Like Keating, Pickering has been known to do the unusual in his
classroom. He's lectured from a desktop, from outside a window or
while wearing wastepaper baskets on his feet. He also returned to
his prep school as a young teacher after studying in England. But
unlike the movie, there was never any conflict between Pickering and
school administrators, and he left the school on good terms.
   ``Whatever of me is in that character has got to be small,'' the
47-year-old Pickering said during recent interview at his home. ``I
was a kid and he was a child. Twenty-three years ago. How much of me
could there be in the movie? Not very much.''
   The screenplay was written by Tom Schulman, who was a 15-year-old
student at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tenn., when he took
a course from Pickering. Pickering, who had returned to the United
States after a year of study at Cambridge University, taught at the
private school for just one year, 1965-66.
   Schulman has acknowledged Pickering's influence on his life and
the screenplay, and has said much of his love for language and
literature originated in that course.
   Pickering hasn't seen the movie _ his three children were sick
and now he's in Canada for the summer. But many of his friends in
Nashville have seen the film, and they immediately recognized
Pickering as the inspiration for the movie's teacher. The friends
began talking and soon the news media picked up on the subject.
   ``I don't mind being the center of attention if I can control it,
but I can't control this,'' he said of the numerous inquiries he's
received from reporters and acquaintances.
   Pickering, who was born and raised in Nashville, is puzzled as to
why he had so much influence on a former student and how it was that
his friends so readily saw him in the movie. He's also flattered.
   ``I'm the most ordinary guy in the world,'' he said as he draped
his leg over the arm of a chair and picked at a hole in the knee of
his jeans. ``Sometimes people remember me, and I don't know why. I
don't know if I did anything special then as a teacher. I was young
and lively.''
   What he does in class is unplanned, he said. He does many unusual
things to get his students to think for themselves, but a bad back
has forced him to abandon such acrobatics as desktop lectures. His
classroom is also on the second floor now, making the leaps from
windows unwise.
   ``Sometimes you get bored in the classroom,'' he said. ``This
semester when my class was over, the last class, two girls in my
class jumped up and gave an imitation of me right in front of the
class. They got A's. You'd think they might get F's, but I've
learned since.''
   Pickering bursts into laughter after telling the story. He laughs
often and easily as he recalls the past. He finds many things
humorous in life and often downplays his own accomplishments.
   Since leaving Montgomery Bell Academy, he has completed a
doctorate and taught in Syria and Jordon and at Dartmouth College.
He's been at the University of Connecticut since 1978, where in
addition to teaching, he's become well-known as an essayist.
   He writes about his three children, his wife, his mother and
father and ordinary things in life. His writing, as might be
expected, is humorous and self-critical, but also bawdy and
philosophical. He has published three books of his essays and is
working on a fourth. He plans to write an essay on the celebrity
that has come to him in the wake of ``Dead Poets Society.''
   His most recent book, ``May Days'' (University of Iowa, 1988),
includes an essay on Montgomery Bell Academy. It pokes fun at the
idea of a ``Southern gentleman'' and Pickering's exploits as a
student, athlete and practical joker.
   From these experiences, Pickering has shaped a teaching
philosophy that has in turn influenced many others.
   ``There are very few givens that I accept. I don't reject any
either. But I think that kids ought to start looking,'' Pickering
said. ``When somebody says it's green, then you should turn around
and say maybe it's not green. What's the truth? That's all I do.''
