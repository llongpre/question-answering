   Academy Award season wouldn't be complete
without a town full of busted egos. This year is no exception, with
acclaimed filmmakers from Spike Lee to Michael Moore grumbling
about their Oscar snubs.
   Lee, the respected writer-director of ``Do the Right Thing,''
and Moore, who won acclaim for ``Roger &amp; Me,'' have cause for
complaint. Lee's film landed on 81 film critics' Top 10 lists, but
earned just two nominations, and is not up for best picture.
``Roger &amp; Me,'' the documentary embraced by critics and audiences
with equal zeal, was blanked completely.
   ``We wuz robbed,'' said Lee. ``We got jerked out of best
director, best film. I think my cinematographer did a great job. .
.. I know in my heart that my father, Bill Lee, deserved a
nomination for best score.''
   A bitter Moore said when nominations were revealed that his film
``violated two of the principal rules of documentary filmmaking _
it was entertaining and people were going to see it.''
   Director Bruce Beresford's ``Driving Miss Daisy'' led all films
with nine nominations. But Beresford was not named in the best
director competition.
   ``Enemies, A Love Story,'' which opened to rave reviews, earned
just three nominations, and the elaborately produced ``Batman''
drew just one nomination for art direction. Ed Zwick, the director
of ``Glory,'' was bypassed, too. ``Glory'' also was not named for
best picture.
   One of the most successful independent movies of the 1980s,
``sex, lies and videotape,'' collected only one nomination _ for
original screenplay.
   ``My Left Foot'' was one of the few films that impressed both
the toughest critics and voters in the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences. Among its five nominations was a best supporting
actress selection to Brenda Fricker.
   ``I had won the Los Angeles Film Critics' awards, and thought,
well, in the film center of the world, the critics said you've done
something right,'' Fricker said. ``It never crossed my mind for one
second I would be nominated.'' Why the surprise? The Oscars tend to
prefer ``safe'' but ``socially relevant'' films such as ``Born on
the Fourth of July'' (eight nominations), ``Dead Poets Society''
(four nominations) and ``Glory'' (five nominations).
   ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' a gritty work about self-indulgent drug
addicts on a crime spree, was selected as film of the year by the
National Society of Film Critics. Unsafe and scarcely socially
conscious, it earned no Oscar nominations.
   For the second year in a row, Academy voters did not nominate
the year's most praised documentary. Last year, Errol Morris' ``The
Thin Blue Line,'' which led to the release of wrongly convicted
murderer Randall Dale Adams, was overlooked for best documentary
feature, best picture, best director and best score, by Philip
Glass.
   This year, the victim was ``Roger &amp; Me,'' Moore's controversial
chronicle of General Motors and its effect on unemployment and the
economy of Flint, Mich.
   The omission of ``Roger &amp; Me'' prompted 44 filmmakers to write
the Academy. Expressing their ``shock and outrage'' over the
perceived oversight, the filmmakers asked that the Academy consider
changing the documentary voting.
   Some of Hollywood's more humble performers say the real honor is
just being nominated. However, both ``The Turning Point'' (1977)
and ``The Color Purple'' (1985) earned an impressive 11
nominations. Neither won one trophy.
   The slight was probably greater with Steven Spielberg's ``The
Color Purple.'' Spielberg won the best director prize from the
Directors Guild of America that year, but wasn't nominated by the
Academy. Only three times since 1949 has the DGA winner not
repeated at the Oscars.
   An Oscar insult has as much to do with money as it does pride.
Unemployment and underemployment in the movie business is soaring.
   On any average week, only 10 percent of the Screen Actors Guild
is working. The average actor's income is $10,400, and 80 percent
of the guild's membership annually earns less than $5,000 from
SAG-related work.
   In any given year, half of the Writers Guild of America West
does not work. The DGA does not supply employment data.
   ``Why do people want to win Oscars? It's the same reason why
horse owners want to win the Derby (in England),'' said Shane
Connaughton, who's nominated with Jim Sheridan for best adapted
screenplay for ``My Left Foot.''
   ``And, of course, the money is very important. If you win, your
price goes up.''
   Recognition such as an Oscar nomination means added dollars both
for the talent and the studio. Touchstone Home Video, for example,
has moved the video release of ``Dead Poets Society'' to March 28.
If the film wins any statuettes, it'll be in video stores in two
days.
   Warner Bros. has estimated that the nominations for ``Driving
Miss Daisy'' will mean at least another $20 million at the box
office.
