   The professor whose teaching inspired the film
``Dead Poets Society'' says he isn't really interested in poetry, a
subject he doesn't believe is practical for today's college
students.
   ``I don't even think college is practical, so I don't think it
makes any difference,'' said Samuel F. Pickering Jr., an English
professor at the University of Connecticut.
   Tom Schulman, a student Pickering taught 25 years ago, wrote the
screenplay for ``Dead Poets Society'' and based fictional
prep-school teacher John Keating on Pickering.
   In the film, actor Robin Williams as Keating motivates his
students with an off-the-wall teaching style and his message of
``carpe diem,'' Latin for ``seize the day.''
   Pickering, addressing Pittsburgh-area teachers Wednesday at a
poetry forum, has admitted to some of Keating's tactics, including
lecturing from a desk top and from outside a window.
   ``I quote a lot of poetry - if I can remember it,'' he said.
``Maybe it teaches them to think and to see things and hear things
in a different way.''
   Pickering, 48, an essayist, told the teachers he finds
inspiration for writing in ordinary events. Eating breakfast with
his three young children gives him more to write about than hours
of heavy contemplation.

   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Sandy Dennis, who has earned an Academy Award
and two Tony Awards during her acting career, says she never goes
to the movies and would rather read a good book.
   Miss Dennis, at work here on the set of Sean Penn's film ``The
Indian Runner,'' also said her favorite film is not ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?'' for which she won an Oscar in 1965 for
supporting actress.
   It's ``Thank You All Very Much,'' an obscure 1969 British film
about a girl who must raise a child she had out of wedlock.
   ``People always think that awards are very important, and they
were very nice, I don't mean that, but they were never anything I
thought that much about,'' Miss Dennis said after her first morning
of filming Monday in Ralston.
   Miss Dennis, 53, said she never sees the movies she has made and
does not consider herself a fan of film or the theater.
   ``I never go to the theater or films,'' she said, adding that
she would rather read a good book at her home in Westport, Conn.
   Penn is making his directing debut with ``The Indian Runner,''
based on a family living in the Plattsmouth area and set in 1968.
The film is scheduled for release in the fall of 1991.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Trumpeter Al Hirt says he's planning a fourth
trip down the aisle when he weds Beverly Essel in her hometown of
Minnetonka, Minn., this winter.
   He has known Ms. Essel, a recent widow and former dancer with
Horace Heidt's band, for 40 years, according to his son-in-law, Ron
Caron.
   Hirt and Ms. Essel plan to marry Dec. 29.
   Hirt, who won a Grammy Award in 1963, has recorded more than 50
albums and ran a nightclub in the French Quarter here for 22 years
until a sluggish local economy forced him to close it in 1983.
   Now on the road with a five-piece back-up band, Hirt is looking
for a new home in New Orleans for him and the group, Caron said.
   Hirt divorced his third wife, Zide Jahnche Hirt, in May 1989,
after a bitter court fight.

   GRESHAM, Ore. (AP) - Rep. Denny Smith broke his right arm and
thumb when he fell from a scaffold while washing his antique
airplane at his Salem home.
   Smith, R-Ore., who is wearing a cast on his forearm, also
scraped his head and suffered a black eye as a result of a fall on
concrete, said his wife, Deanna.
   Deanna Smith said Wednesday her husband fell about 5 feet from
the scaffold while he was washing the airplane Sunday evening.
Smith did not seek medical care until Monday morning, she said.
   Smith, a former Vietnam combat pilot, was unable to attend
President Bush's Persian Gulf speech Tuesday night but will return
to Washington this weekend, she said.

   Baseball owners on Thursday unanimously
approved the appointment of Broadway producer Robert Nederlander as
the New York Yankees new general partner, replacing George
Steinbrenner.
   The vote followed the recommendation of the ownership committee,
which met with Nederlander for two hours Wednesday to discuss
financial disclosures and his plans for the last-place team.
   ``He was very impressive,'' Commissioner Fay Vincent said.
   Nederlander's approval required a three-fourths vote of American
League owners and a majority of National League owners. It came
during the second day of the owners' two-day quarterly meetings.
   Steinbrenner, one of baseball's most controversial owners for
nearly two decades, resigned Aug. 20 following Vincent's
investigation into his ties with gambler Howard Spira. Steinbrenner
is permitted no day-to-day involvement in the Yankees' baseball
operations.
   ``I am honored that Major League Baseball has approved me,'' the
57-year-old Nederlander said in a statement. He has been a limited
partner in the Yankees' organization since 1973.
   The Nederlander Organization owns 30 theaters in the U.S. and
Britain including 11 Broadway theaters. The family is considered
the second-most powerful in American theater, behind the Shuberts.
   Nederlander has presented such Broadway hits as ``Annie,''
``Nicholas Nickleby'' and ``La Cage aux Folles.''
