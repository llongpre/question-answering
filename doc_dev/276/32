   Oscar voters all but ignored
acclaimed, daring films like ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' and ``Do the
Right Thing'' and cast their lots for mainstream titles such as
``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   At the same time, the voters overlooked the year's box-office
blockbusters ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and
``Lethal Weapon 2.''
   The nominations by the more than 4,700 members of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences suggested that if independent
filmmakers were looking for praise from Hollywood, they were
looking in the wrong place.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' writer-director Spike Lee's fiery
account of racial confrontation in New York City, landed on 81 film
critics' top 10 lists, and took the best picture, best director and
best music awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.
   Yet when nominations for the 62nd Academy Awards were announced
Wednesday, ``Do the Right Thing'' could do no right, collecting
just two nominations _ supporting actor for Danny Aiello and
original screenplay for Lee.
   ``In a little way I'm happy, in a little way I'm disappointed,''
Lee said. ``We got jerked outta best director, best film, I think
my cinematographer ... did a great job, I think my editor did a
great job. ... I know in my heart that my father, Bill Lee,
deserved a nomination for best score.''
   While ``Do the Right Thing'' was financed and distributed by
Universal Pictures, the film's inventive style and rough tone ran
against the Hollywood grain. So did ``Drugstore Cowboy'' and ``sex,
lies and videotape,'' both made and distributed outside the studio
system.
   ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' a gritty examination of drug addicts on
the lam, was named film of the year by the National Society of Film
Critics. It collected no Oscar nominations.
   ``Sex, lies and videotape,'' the provocative character study
considered one of the decade's most successful independent films,
took the top prize at last year's Cannes film festival. Academy
voters gave it just one nomination, for best original screenplay.
   Among the more unconventional movies collecting multiple
nominations were ``My Left Foot'' with five nominations and ``Henry
V'' with three.
   The blockbusters _ ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and
``Look Who's Talking'' _ captured only five nominations combined.
``Batman'' co-star Jack Nicholson wasn't nominated, and music
composer Danny Elfman was shut out, too.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' focusing on a difficult Southern Jewish
widow and her black chauffeur, carried off the most nominations,
nine, including best picture and best actors for Morgan Freeman,
Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd.
   Aykroyd's nomination was one of most unusual, as the actor has
rarely been taken seriously in the critical community.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's account
of Ron Kovic's painful passage from blind patriotism to anti-war
protester after a Vietnam war wound that left him a paraplegic,
drew eight nominations, including best picture.
   Also nominated for top picture were ``Dead Poets Society,''
``Field of Dreams'' and ``My Left Foot.''
   ``My Left Foot'' best supporting actress nominee Brenda Fricker
said from Ireland that she was surprised, and her comments hinted
at the wide gulf separating the Academy from the critical community.
   ``I had won the Los Angeles Film Critics' awards, and thought,
well, in the film center of the world, the critics said you've done
something right. It never crossed my mind for one second I would be
nominated,'' she said.
   In the studio race, Universal led all comers with 17
nominations, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. had 11, Tri-Star
collected nine, Paramount and Disney had eight, Miramax seven,
Orion six, Columbia five, Samuel Goldwyn three and MGM-UA collected
one.
   For the second time in two years, voters did not nominate the
year's most acclaimed documentary. ``Roger &amp; Me,'' filmmaker
Michael Moore's satirical perspective on General Motors and the
people of Flint, Mich., was overlooked.
   In 1989, the Academy failed to nominate Errol Morris' ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' which led to freedom for Randall Dale Adams after more
than a decade on Texas' death row.
   The winners, selected by members of the academy, will be
presented March 26 and broadcast live by ABC-TV.
