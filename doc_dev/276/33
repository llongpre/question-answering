   Tom Hanks brought his kids, Dan Aykroyd wore
shorts and Paula Abdul couldn't stop giggling.
   Tonight's 62nd Annual Academy Awards were a day away, and the
pressure was mounting. Yet the final rehearsal Sunday for the Oscar
ceremony had all the gravity of a frog-jumping contest.
   With overcast skies in the forecast and overanxious fans
settling in the bleachers outside, Oscar presenters Hanks, Aykroyd,
Abdul, Tom Selleck, Gregory Peck, Jane Fonda, Jeff Bridges and
Jessica Tandy playfully practiced their corny award introductions.
   About 500 family, friends and related hangers-on settled into
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to hear the patter.
   Chevy Chase joked with a rotund Aykroyd that Chase should have
been nominated for his work in ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation.''
   And so it went. One camera operator was so bored by the
proceedings that he spent the better part of an hour scanning the
Sunday comics. Other technicians collapsed on a couch to watch NCAA
tournament basketball.
   The producer of this year's Oscar show is Gilbert Cates. He has
been asked to avenge the legacy of last year's Las Vegas-like
celebration of Oscar glitz.
   This year's show will feature muted tones and conservative
production numbers. In one of the most daring departures from
tradition, Bugs Bunny will present the Oscar for best animated
short film.
   ``I hope the outfits people wear are more spectacular than the
sets,'' said rehearsal watcher Linda Alexander.
   An estimated 1 billion viewers in 90 countries will tune into
the ABC telecast to see if ``Born on the Fourth of July'' can
triumph over its own hype and four other acclaimed films.
   The world will be watching, too, to see if ``Fourth of July''
star Tom Cruise is more popular than Daniel Day-Lewis from ``My
Left Foot.''
   All of the advertising, primping and interviewing is over. The
only drama that remains _ outside of what Cher will wear _ is whose
names are hiding in the envelopes.
   The Academy Awards are wrapped in fancy clothes, ornate parties
and elaborate production numbers. But the glitz only obscures a
common, rather artless pursuit: winning.
   In an industry where good accounting often is more important
than good acting, the Oscars now represent the ultimate marketing
tool. The motion picture studios spend combined millions on Academy
Award vote campaigns, and not because acceptance speeches are fun
to watch. Oscar trophies mean money.
   After winning last year's best picture prize, ``Rain Man'' went
on to make $36 million more in theaters. In four of the last seven
years, the best picture winner has been one of the top five
highest-grossing films of the year, according to Entertainment Data
Inc.
   Best picture nominee ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' one of the
Oscar favorites, is wilting at the box office. An Oscar would
certainly brighten its future.
   Already, Oscar nominations have given new life to two
independent films, ``My Left Foot'' and ``Henry V,'' still playing
strongly months after their debut.
   Videocassettes for ``Dead Poets Society'' and ``Field of
Dreams,'' also up for best picture, have been shipped to stores. An
Oscar triumph would give each a kick in the pants.
   Prognosticators are split over predictions for the top five
categories.
   The favorites for best picture, according to critics and
oddsmakers, are ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``Driving Miss
Daisy.'' If Aykroyd wins for best supporting actor, it could be
``Driving Miss Daisy's'' night.
   If Brenda Fricker takes the early award for best supporting
actress, the ceremony may belong to ``My Left Foot.''
