   The Academy voter, who can be as contrary as
Jessica Tandy in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ignored the sex- and
action-charged blockbusters of 1989 to bestow major nominations
Wednesday on films about race relations, Vietnam and the
handicapped.
   Ler cerebral palsy (``My Left Foot'').
   Nor did the Academy voter succumb to a failing memory. Although
studios favor late-year releases for Oscar hopefuls, two of the
best-picture nominees were released early in the year: ``Dead Poets
Society'' and ``Field of Dreams.''
   No matter that the late Laurence Olivier had created an
unforgettable ``Henry V,'' winning a special Academy Award in 1946.
The new, scruffier ``Henry V'' (or ``Hank Cinq'' as the Olivier
version was called) won a best actor nomination for the new kid on
the classics block, Kenneth Branagh.
   The odds were against a nomination for Marlon Brando as
supporting actor in ``A Dry White Season.'' After all, he had
thumbed his nose at the Academy in 1973, sending a young Indian
woman to reject his Oscar for ``The Godfather.'' Besides, few
people had seen ``A Dry White Season,'' an earnest, uneven film
about apartheid in South Africa. But Brando's two scenes contained
enough of his oldtime magic to make him a nominee.
   When Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar for her role of a lifetime in
``Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), she groused that it was unfair to
compete with an actress who had played her role hundreds of times
on the stage (she lost to Judy Holliday, who had created the Billie
Dawn role in ``Born Yesterday'' in the theater).
   If the Swanson theory had been adopted, Pauline Collins
(``Shirley Valentine''), Morgan Freeman (``Driving Miss Daisy'')
and Kenneth Branagh (``Henry V'') would not have been eligible for
the acting nominations. On the London and New York stages, Miss
Collins comprised the entire cast of ``Shirley Valentine.''
   Among the many surprises in the 62nd nominations was Isabelle
Adjani, nominated as best actress in the subtitled French film
``Camille Claudia.'' Sophia Loren won as best actress for the
Italian ``Two Women'' in 1961, and Max Von Sydow was nominated last
year for Denmark's ``Pele the Conqueror.'' But rarely has the
Academy recognized an actor who speaks a foreign tongue.
   For the second time in a row, Academy members refused to
nominate a popular documentary; this year it was Michael Moore's
humorous and controversial indictment of General Motors, ``Roger &amp;
Me.''
   Recent weeks have brought criticism of Moore's film for its
faulty juxtaposition of time elements and its entertainment values
at the expense of accuracy.
   So the Academy voter again defies the wise money and casts a
ballot on the basis of conscience and artistic integrity. It should
be a dandy awards festival on March 26.
