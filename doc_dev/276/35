"Driving Miss Daisy," the surprise hit about a tart Southern matron and her 
black chauffeur, won Oscars for best picture and best actress, as Hollywood 
scattered its laurels around the globe during the 62nd annual Academy Awards 
ceremony Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone won his second statuette for best director on Universal Pictures' 
"Born on the Fourth of July," the political and psychological odyssey of 
Vietnam veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourth of July" also took an award for film editing, but those were the 
movie's only Oscars, despite eight nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Daniel Day-Lewis edged aside "Fourth of July" star Tom Cruise to 
capture the Oscar for best actor for portraying Irish writer-artist Christy 
Brown's struggle with cerebral palsy in Miramax's "My Left Foot." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Fricker was named best supporting actress for her role as Brown's mother 
in the film, which had also received nominations for best picture and best 
director after it was initially overlooked by audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In a widely expected award, London-born stage and film veteran Jessica Tandy 
was named best actress for her portrayal of the cantankerous Jewish dowager in 
"Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on Cloud 9!" the actress said as she picked up her statuette -- and became 
the academy's oldest best-actress winner at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Uhry, who won a 1987 Pulitzer Prize for the play on which "Miss Daisy" 
was based, won for best screenplay adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
The film also won the makeup award, reflecting the difficulty of making up 
actors to reflect their changing ages in the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Daisy," initially turned down by the major studios, was made by Warner 
Bros. only after producers Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck slashed its budget and 
secured additional backing from British film financier Jake Eberts. 
</P>
<P>
It nonetheless racked up nine Oscar nominations and, to date, $70 million at 
the U.S. box office, and bucked the conventional wisdom again by becoming one 
of the few films ever to win the best-picture Oscar without its director having 
been nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here for one very simple reason. Bruce Beresford is a brilliant 
director," Richard Zanuck said in accepting the best-picture Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, who previously won Oscars for directing "Platoon," the best picture of 
1986, and for writing "Midnight Express," had been widely favored to win this 
year's directing Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"My deepest thanks for your acknowledgement that Vietnam is not over, although 
some people say it is," Stone said of the war in which he fought and was 
decorated. 
</P>
<P>
Denzel Washington was named best supporting actor for his portrayal of a 
maverick black soldier in the Civil War drama "Glory," distributed by Tri-Star 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to pay homage to . . . the black soldiers who helped make this country 
free," Washington said in accepting. His was the only major prize for "Glory," 
but the film also took Oscars for best cinematography and best sound. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ceremony, produced by film and TV director Gil Cates, carried an 
international theme that was supposed to reflect the growing 
internationalization of the film business and the way new communications 
technologies have helped break down cultural barriers. Several Oscar presenters 
announced prizes by satellite hookups from London, Moscow, Sydney, and Buenos 
Aires. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you have a closed society when the skies are open from Moscow to 
Beijing to, you name it, Gary, Indiana?" academy President Karl Malden said as 
the show began. 
</P>
<P>
While the Oscar telecast was seen in about 27 million homes in the United 
States last year, the show's international audience has grown to over a billion 
viewers in about 90 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood studios such as Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures say they 
currently get nearly half their film revenue abroad, with some films, such as 
Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" pulling in substantially more 
from foreign markets than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The show, broadcast on the ABC television network and hosted by actor-comedian 
Billy Crystal, was slow-paced, and lasted 3 hours and 35 minutes after opening 
shortly after 6 p.m. The show had moved back to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
of the Music Center, where it was held previously, amid grumbling about 
congestion at the much larger and older Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is expected to return to the older venue again next year. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening monologue, Crystal took some satirical jabs at modern-day 
Hollywood, as he quipped about Jack Nicholson's huge salary, Japan-based Sony 
Corp.'s takeover of Columbia Pictures, and Paramount's much-publicized fight 
with Art Buchwald over the profits from its hit, "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
Of 330 films in an opening montage, Crystal joked, "not one has yet gone into 
profit" according to Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the relatively subdued presentation contrasted with last year's show, which 
attracted a larger-than-usual TV audience but was sharply criticized by 
Hollywood insiders for its glitzy production numbers staged by producer Allan 
Carr. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier show included a song and dance by Snow White and actor Rob Lowe, 
which proved an embarrassment when Walt Disney Co. later sued the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for trademark infringement. The suit was 
dropped after the academy apologized. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ceremony included a special tribute to Japanese filmmaker Akira 
Kurosawa, who has inspired such American directors as George Lucas, Steven 
Spielberg and Lawrence Kasdan with dramas such as "Yojimbo," "The Seven 
Samurai" and "Ran." Many of those films in turn drew inspiration from 
non-Japanese sources that ranged from Shakespeare to American westerns. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosawa's "Rashomon" and "Dersu Uzala" won Oscars for best foreign language 
film, but the 80-year-old filmmaker has never been honored as best director. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't feel that I have yet grasped the essence of cinema," Kurosawa 
said in accepting a lifetime achievement award from Lucas and Spielberg. "I 
promise you from now on, I will work as hard as I can at making movies. Maybe 
by following this path, I will achieve an understanding of the true essence of 
cinema, and earn this." 
</P>
<P>
"Cinema Paradiso," director Giuseppe Tornatore's tribute to the movie culture 
of the 1940s and 1950s, captured the award for best foreign language film for 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry V," a Shakespearean adaptation that won best-actor and best-director 
nominations for 29-year-old Kenneth Branagh, won an Oscar only for best costume 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros.'s "Batman," the year's biggest box-office success, was nominated 
only once, but took the prize for best art direction by Anton Furst. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which was directed by Spielberg and 
became Paramount's biggest hit last year, also won a single Oscar, for sound 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" -- nominated for best picture, best actor, and best 
director -- received only a single award for Tom Schulman's screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"The Little Mermaid," Walt Disney Co.'s animated entry, won best song and 
original score prizes for composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman. 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss," an underwater epic that proved to be a box-office disappointment 
for 20th Century Fox, received an Oscar for visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Oscar nominations were laced with surprises, as academy members 
overlooked some critical and box-office favorites to honor films that escaped 
wide notice before the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Among the critical favorites overlooked in this year's nominations were 
actor-director Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," which received nominations 
only for best supporting actor and best screenplay, and "Glory," which was 
bypassed for best picture, director, and screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Kim Basinger gently chided the academy for all but ignoring Lee's 
picture, which had been critically acclaimed for its tough look at race 
relations in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"It might tell the greatest truth of all," Basinger said during her appearance 
on the telecast, asserting that "Do the Right Thing" should have been among the 
best picture nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Koch Sr., a longtime film producer and director who was once Paramount's 
top movie executive, was awarded the academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Charles Guggenheim's "The Johnstown Flood" was named best documentary 
short, while Robert Epstein's and Bill Couturie's "Common Threads: Stories from 
the Quilt," about the AIDS epidemic, won for best documentary feature. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary nominees did not include Michael Moore's popular anti-General 
Motors satire, "Roger and Me" -- an exclusion that has prompted proposals that 
the academy change its documentary-nominating procedures for next year. 
</P>
<P>
James Hendrie's "Work Experience" was the best live-action short film, and 
Christoph and Wolfgang Lauenstein's "Balance" won the Oscar for best animated 
short.
