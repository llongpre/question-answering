<LEADPARA>  THIS time of year, it's supposed to be raining. But paradise -- a technical
term for the city on this particularly fine day -- simply refused to oblige.
The sky is a hard enamel blue despite the autumn odds, and Robin Williams
engages in some dry humor.;   "People will be going, 'What's that, Ma?'
'That's rain, Tommy.' 'What's that like, Ma?' 'Well, you know when the
sprinklers go off?' "  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE PETER PAN PRINCIPAL
IT SEEMS LIKE TYPECASTING: ROBIN WILLIAMS AS THE
BOY WHO REFUSED TO GROW UP. BUT WILLIAMS HAS GROWN
-- INTO ONE OF OUR BEST ACTORS  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Williams' blue eyes are shaded by a fringe of brown hair. His barrel chest
is encased in a delicate vest made of Japanese fabric swatches. Even his feet
scream Robin Williams -- one is shod in a red sneaker, the other in primary
yellow.;   As he riffs, and trudges down a dusty path in Golden Gate Park,
Williams is feeling very much on solid ground. To his left the rich foliage
breaks to disclose the Polo Field. There last month, Williams, among others,
had been entertaining the troops -- the 300,000 mourners for rock impresario
Bill Graham and the embattled '60s ideals he stood for.;   "There was a great
quote of (Graham). He said, 'When things . . . you off, you've got a choice.
You can either sit there and kvetch and say, "Oh, this is awful," or do
something about it.' I think the one thing I picked up from him is you can do
something about it and also have a great time," muses Williams, himself a
stalwart of Comic Relief benefits for the homeless for four years.;   Williams
"feels this responsibility to what he stands for," says Lynda Obst, who
co-produced the actor's recent film "The Fisher King," "be it the innocence
and the joy of childhood, which he can bring into his performance, or that
innocence of the time we all shared in the '60s that Bill Graham emblemized.";
  If it takes a certain innocence to emerge from the '80s with altruism
intact, then Williams is the grown-up of choice to harness his own inner child
for fun and profit. It's a quality that sets him apart from most other
box-office behemoths. After the hard-charging politics of the '60s and the
materialism of the '80s, here comes the movie star for the '90s -- a
combination of the two, the reluctant millionaire with a message.;   So
Williams' selection as the born-again adolescent Peter Pan in Steven
Spielberg's "Hook" would seem to be stunningly obvious.;   "The minute Steven
heard that Robin wanted to do Peter, he was ecstatic," says Kathleen Kennedy,
a co-producer of "Hook" (TriStar's big Christmas release, which opens
Wednesday). "He felt that Robin embodies everything about the child inside of
us, and that was really the message that he was trying to achieve with the
movie.";   But perhaps paradoxically, playing to type has often been a
double-edged sword for the latest Peter Pan in his own battles at the box
office. His first film role, Robert Altman's "Popeye" (1980), may have seemed
a logical next step from his dazzlingly successful portrayal of TV's
interplanetary Mork from Ork. But the big-screen fantasy was a notorious
commercial and critical disaster, flayed in part for binding the actor behind
a turgid cartoon character.;   Now, Williams is mindful of certain eerie
similarities to Peter Pan. "I was like, 'This is a little frightening,' " he
says. "That's why doing Peter Pan is still a little like, oooohhhh, another
character with the name 'P.' Another icon. Oh, man. You want that pressure?"; 
 No way to win;   What's more, Williams' typical roles have tended to confront
him with a critical conundrum -- he's cast for being Robin Williams, then he's
castigated for it.;   His portrayal of the cuddly schizophrenic Parry in "The
Fisher King," another baby step from his stand-up persona, may have been
anointed by some East Coast critics, but it drew typically mixed reviews: the
Chicago Tribune wrung its hands over "so much burly humanity, particularly of
the overbearing Robin Williams variety" and the Boston Globe groaned, "You
wish the film would go off the deep end, as Williams' character would do more
often if it weren't so tied to his stand-up comic reflexes." Williams
acknowledges that his wife, Marsha, reminds him when his act interferes with
his acting.;   Forget his nemesis Hook. In this incarnation of Peter Pan, the
hero's biggest challenge could be his own shadow -- "that little manic guy" as
Williams has tagged his public image, a 78-rpm comedian weaned on a steady
diet of audience feedback. For despite Williams' success on Hollywood's terms
-- big box office -- getting the public to see him as more than a frenzied
funnyman has been no joke.;   That little guy;   "It's hard because people
want to know you're a certain thing," he says. "They still say, 'That's the
little manic guy. He's the little adrenaline guy. Oh, yeah, he touches
himself. He doesn't do that anymore. But wait a minute. He's the little manic
guy who played the really quiet guy and then the really scary guy. Oh, no,
wait . . .' ";   Williams' shrewdest career moves may have been those that
allowed him to fly without a performing net -- his comic shtick -- ultimately
enabling him to buck Hollywood's tendency to tuck actors into neat corners,
particularly those with strong comic identities. Ever since his tour de force
in "Good Morning, Vietnam" in 1987, Williams has parlayed his romance with the
box office into an unusually broad range of roles and been rewarded for his
trouble with two Oscar nominations (for "Vietnam" and "Dead Poets Society").; 
 His future could hold the biggest stretch yet. Williams wants to fly without
his box-office parachute -- his immense likability onscreen -- in favor of
playing roles that would be, frankly, despicable. Given his druthers, Williams
would rather have played bad boy Hook.;   "It's like a champagne villain," he
says. "You can have a great time. It's necessary to change people's parameters
of you. You start getting the reputation for being the cuddly guy and then you
(say), 'OK. Let's mess with that.' Try something that's slightly insidious and
try to push those bounds a bit.";   "He's treating the whole film-star
experience as though he were still a student, with an appetite for new
experiences, instead of being guarded and cautious and safe," says Christopher
Reeve, a friend of Williams' since their days at New York's Juilliard School
in the mid-'70s. "It's a unique phenomenon, that he's growing as he becomes
more successful. Usually, I think, people become more limited as they become
more successful because they want to hang onto something that works.";   "He's
a city-state, what a friend refers to as singular artists working within the
mainstream," says Peter Weir, who directed Williams in "Dead Poets Society."
"A city-state with its own army, its own controls and foreign policies.";  
Williams is considered peer to the handful of actors who can "open" a film,
the industry term for the ability to snare an audience simply by showing up.
He can command $4 million to $7 million a film. (For "Hook," Williams will
earn a portion of the box-office gross instead of salary.);   "He can get a
movie made," says Obst, who credits Williams with doing exactly that for the
quirky "Fisher King." "He is a green light.";   At 40, Williams has come a
long way from the frenetically brilliant young talent who beguiled yet
befuddled his acting teachers.;   But Williams denies his success is due to
playing to the great Hollywood maw. If he did any adapting, he says, it was to
the scripts, not the town: "I adapted to the character and to the director,
who said whatever energy you had before was not viable for this. It's like the
old joke -- a skin graft on a leper. It won't hold.";   The role of Peter Pan
appeals to the predictably childlike part of Williams that loves to hunker
down with the four computers and fantasy figures in the "war room" of his
sprawling Napa Valley ranch, and finds nothing more enchanting than the
prospect of playing with his children, Zachary, 8, and Zelda, 2 (a third
child, Cody, was born Nov. 25).;   With "Dead Poets," whose free-thinking prep
school teacher urged his charges to "seize the day," Williams was able to make
good on John Houseman's activist acting lessons at New York's Juilliard
School. Indeed, outsider hero roles have had particular allure for the actor.
In his film early this year, "Awakenings," Williams played a dedicated,
dithering doctor who briefly resuscitated post-encephalitic patients in a sort
of mental limbo in the face of his naysayers.;   Williams reverted to type
with Parry, the homeless schizophrenic and erstwhile medieval scholar of "The
Fisher King" -- perhaps the quintessential Robin Williams role. The film was
an urban myth that blurred the line between genius and madness, that called on
Williams' qualities of innocence and gentleness and that challenged his
audience to find dignity among the downtrodden.;   Williams as Harvey Milk?;  
Along those activist lines, Williams is contemplating playing Harvey Milk, the
murdered San Francisco supervisor who was the city's first public official to
acknowledge his homosexuality. "The range of homophobia in America is so
huge," Williams says, "plus he was an amazingly charismatic and dynamic man.
Very complex.";   Far from a recluse, Williams lives mainly in the middle of
the city, on an unpretentiously elegant Presidio Heights street; they are
renting the tawny-shingled home while their oceanfront house is renovated. And
if others of his ilk prompt everyman to admire and desire them, Williams seems
to inspire something else, that elusive grail of actors everywhere -- the
sheer, unadulterated affection of his public.;   In fact, for the past few
hours, they have been peppering him with hellos with almost rhythmic
regularity, greetings Williams returns in courtly fashion. Even as he hunkers
down on a log in Golden Gate Park, a dark-haired woman, surprised at her
celebrity find, plops her son next to Williams for a quick picture. Then she
hurries off, leaving him again to explain why he keeps returning to roles like
the unevenly received Parry of "The Fisher King" that nevertheless show
compassion for the dispossessed.;   "You've got to try and help in some way,"
he is saying as the shutter clicks behind him. "People forget that Christ hung
out with lepers and sinners, thieves. He preferred to be with them than the
people in the temple. There he found salvation, in those acts of compassion.
The moment you serve the grail, it's yours for all eternity."  </TEXT>
