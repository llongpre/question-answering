   ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
``Glory'' and ``When Harry Met Sally'' were favored in tonight's
47th Annual Golden Globes competition.
   Hosts Cybill Shepherd and Sam Elliott will preside over the
ceremonies, carried by Turner Broadcasting Service starting at 7
p.m. PST.
   A total of 24 awards _ 13 for motion pictures and 11 for
television programs _ were selected by 83 voting members of the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
   The globes often serve as indicators of the Academy Awards,
whose nominations are to be announced Feb. 14.
   Last year, for example, ``Rain Man'' took two top Golden Globes
and went on to dominate the Academy Awards.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's gripping
account of how a patriotic soldier's attitudes about war are
exploded in Vietnam, had five nominations. Tom Cruise, who stars in
the film as paraplegic Ron Kovic, was nominated as best actor in a
dramatic motion picture.
   Stone was nominated for best director and the film was named in
the race for best dramatic motion picture.
   Unlike the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes divide films into
the categories of dramas and musicals or comedies.
   Also nominated for best dramatic picture were ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Do the Right Thing'' and
``Glory.''
   The selections for best musical or comic movie were ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' ``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Shirley Valentine,'' ``The
War of the Roses'' and ``When Harry Met Sally ...''
   ``Glory,'' the account of a black Union regiment fighting in the
Civil War, earned a total of five nominations, as did ``When Harry
Met Sally ...''
   ``L.A. Law,'' with eight nominations, was the favored television
show.
