   Comedian Robin Williams accepted the 1989
Man of the Year Award on Tuesday from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals,
and found a new use for the Harvard University group's traditional
gift, a brass pudding pot.
   ``The country's only a trillion dollars in debt. Please help,''
he said as he passed the pot around at a news conference.
   Williams wore a rainbow-colored brassiere and wig and shared a
stage with female impersonators as he accepted the prize, which
recognizes a ``lasting and impressive contribution to the world of
entertainment.''
   ``I'll put it on the shelf,'' he promised.
   Hasty Pudding, the nation's oldest undergraduate dramatic
organization, gave an identical brass pot and its Woman of the Year
Award to actress Kathleen Turner last week.
   Williams received his award before the curtain went up on the
Hasty Pudding's 141st annual musical farce, a spoof on Prohibition
called ``Whiskey Business.'' As always, the show has an all-male
cast, including many students dressed as women.
   Since gaining fame as Mork in the television series ``Mork &amp;
Mindy,'' Williams has gone on to success in films including ``The
World According to Garp'' and ``Moscow on the Hudson.'' His
portrayal of Adrian Cronauer, the comic disc jockey in ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' earned him a Golden Globe best-actor award and
an Academy Award nomination in 1987.
   Williams said Tuesday he hadn't expected to win an Oscar: ``I
didn't think I had a shot. It's just like Gary Coleman joining the
NBA.''
   He said he believes comedy generally receives less recognition
than it should.
   His latest movie, ``The Dead Poets Society,'' is scheduled for
release in June. Williams said he portrays a teacher of English
literature in a private boys' school in 1959, a role with ``some
humor, more drama.''
   Hasty Pudding mebers advised Williams, who as Mork used to drink
water with his finger, that he would be allowed to drink from the
pudding pot with his finger. But they said cooking anything in the
brass vessel could be a problem. When past man-of-the-year recipient
Steven Spielberg tried it, his melted.
