   Oliver Stone, whose films often
follow tortuous paths to the screen, said winning the Directors
Guild of America award for ``Born on the Fourth of July'' should
speed his filmmaking process.
   ``It's giving me more freedom,'' Stone said Saturday night after
collecting the guild's top honor at its annual awards ceremony, a
bellwether for the Academy Awards.
   ``It's a tremendous validation for me. It means I'm doing the
right thing,'' said Stone, a self-described anarchist who has
directed a variety of deeply personal films, including ``Salvador''
and ``Wall Street.''
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Stone's account of the patriot
soldier Ron Kovic whose attitudes about war are shattered in
Vietnam, took more than 10 years to make.
   ``Platoon,'' the acclaimed Vietnam film that Stone also
directed, similarly was a hard sell.
   He said some film projects _ like ``Born on the Fourth of July''
_ can be improved when they have a long time to percolate. He was
quick to point out, too, that simply winning prizes and producing
box-office hits does not make movie making a cake walk.
   ```How sweet it is and how fleeting,'' he said when collecting
his award at a black-tie dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
Backstage, he said his triumph soon would be old news. ``Success
and failure are both impostors,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Stone joins an elite list of directors who have
taken the guild's top honor twice in their careers (Stone also won
for ``Platoon''). Other dual winners include Joseph Mankiewicz,
George Stevens, David Lean, Robert Wise, Francis Ford Coppola and
Milos Forman.
   Stone, who becomes the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for
best director, said he plans to make a third film about Vietnam in
the next several years. He declined to say what the film will focus
on, saying only that it will not concern combat but ``another
aspect'' of war.
   Stone currently is working on a movie about the musical group
The Doors.
   In the 42 years the guild has been handing out the awards, only
three of its picks failed to win the Oscar.
   In addition to Stone, those nominated by the guild for best
director of a feature film were Woody Allen for ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' Rob Reiner for ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' Phil
Alden Robinson for ``Field of Dreams'' and Peter Weir for ``Dead
Poets Society.''
   The Academy did not nominate Reiner or Robinson. Allen, Stone
and Weir are Oscar nominees, along with Kenneth Branagh for ``Henry
V'' and Jim Sheridan for ``My Left Foot.''
   The guild awards _ chosen by a vote of the 9,000 members _ also
recognize best director in several other categories: television
comedy series, dramatic series (day and night), musical-variety,
dramatic specials, sports and commercials.
   Among the others honored were the directors of TV's ``Murphy
Brown'' and ``L.A. Law'' series.
   In television, the award for best director in a comedy went to
Barnet Kellman for the episode ``Brown Like Me,'' on CBS' ``Murphy
Brown.''
   Other TV awards: Dramatic special, Dan Curtis for ABC's ``War
and Remembrance''; dramatic nighttime series, Eric Laneuville for
the ``I'm in the Nude'' episode on NBC's ``L.A. Law''; dramatic
daytime series, Victoria Hochberg for the ``Jacob Have I Loved''
episode on PBS' ``Wonderworks.''
   Also, for musical variety show, Don Mischer for ``Gregory Hines:
Tap Dance in America,'' on PBS' ``Great Performances''; television
documentary, Peter Rosen for ``The Eighth Van Cliburn International
Piano Competition'' on PBS; sports event show, Bob Fishman for the
1989 U.S. Open Tennis Tournament on CBS.
