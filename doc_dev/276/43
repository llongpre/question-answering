<HEAD>Robin Williams Receives Hasty Pudding Award at Harvard</HEAD>

   Comedian Robin Williams found a new use
for the brass pudding pot traditionally given to the Hasty Pudding
Theatricals' Man of the Year.
   ``The country's only a trillion dollars in debt. Please help,''
the 1989 award recipient said as he passed the pot around at a
Harvard University news conference Tuesday.
   Williams wore a rainbow-colored brassiere and wig and shared a
stage with female impersonators Tuesday as he accepted the prize,
which recognizes a ``lasting and impressive contribution to the
world of entertainment.''
   ``I'll put it on the shelf,'' he promised.
   Hasty Pudding, the nation's oldest undergraduate dramatic
organization, gave an identical brass pot and its Woman of the Year
Award to actress Kathleen Turner last week.
   Williams received his award before the curtain went up on the
Hasty Pudding's 141st annual musical farce, a spoof on Prohibition
called ``Whiskey Business.'' As always, the show has an all-male
cast, including many students dressed as women.
   Since gaining fame as Mork in the television series ``Mork &amp;
Mindy,'' Williams has gone on to success in films including ``The
World According to Garp'' and ``Moscow on the Hudson.'' His
portrayal of Adrian Cronauer, the comic disc jockey in ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' earned him a Golden Globe best-actor award and
an Academy Award nomination in 1987.
   His latest movie, ``The Dead Poets Society,'' is scheduled for
release in June. Williams said he portrays a teacher of English
literature in a private boys' school in 1959, a role with ``some
humor, more drama.''
