   The blockbuster action film ``Batman'' and the
comedies ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Parenthood'' helped
Hollywood rack up a record summer gate of $2.05 billion, according
to figures released Tuesday.
   Box-office revenues from Memorial Day to Labor Day were up 20
percent from last summer's record $1.7 billion.
   ``Batman'' emerged as at least the sixth-biggest smash in movie
history with ticket sales to date of $238.6 million.
   ``Nobody in the business can predict how big a movie goes once it
goes big,'' said Rob Friedman, president of worldwide advertising
and publicity for Warner Bros. ``Did we know `Batman' was going to
be a big movie? Yes. Did we know how big? You never know.''
   Exhibitor Relations Co. President John Krier, whose company
compiles box office figures, said, ``The popularity of `Batman'
created a lot of interest in other movies. And once people arrived,
there was a little bit of everything out there, great variety.''
   Among those contributing to the record season were adult
moviegoers, who in recent years have stayed at home. Although exact
figures were unavailable, it is believed older patrons boosted the
grosses of ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Parenthood'' and ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids.'
   ``I've always maintained that if there are good movies out there,
people will go to them,'' said Si Kornblit, executive vice president
of worldwide marketing for Universal, which distributed
``Parenthood.''
   The healthy summer season was expected to lead to a record year
at the nation's theaters, which took in $4.46 billion last year.
   In a summer stuffed with sequels, ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' ``Lethal Weapon 2'' and ``Ghostbusters II'' entertained
capacity crowds for weeks.
   But it was original, uncalculated programming such as ``Dead
Poets Society,'' ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' ``Parenthood'' and
``Turner &amp; Hooch'' that gave this summer's Top 10 list its real
depth.
   Five summer movies surpassed the $100 million mark. The top five,
respectively, were ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' which pulled in $189.5 million; ``Lethal Weapon 2''
($131.3 million), ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' ($119.1 million) and
``Ghostbusters II'' ($109.9 million). The titles accounted for 40
percent of all summer tickets sold.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Dead Poets Society'' ($86.4
million), ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' ($66.6 million),
``Parenthood'' ($64.1 million), ``Turner &amp; Hooch'' ($57.1 million)
and ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' ($50.5 million).
   Even though it finished in the Top 10, ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier'' was not a huge hit, as were a number of other heavily
promoted sequels. ``Karate Kid III'' and the latest James Bond
installment ``Licence to Kill'' also failed to spin turnstiles with
any consistency, earning $37.9 million and $33.2 million,
respectively.
   In the horror genre, the retreads ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5:
The Dream Child'' and ``Friday the 13th VIII: Jason Takes
Manhattan'' did not make killings at the box office. Those films had
revenues of $20 million and $14.1 million.
   Several other summer films featuring superstar names yielded
benchwarmer business. The high-powered flops included Clint
Eastwood's ``Pink Cadillac'' ($12.1 million), Sylvester Stallone in
``Lock Up'' ($17.1 million), ``Casualties of War'' starring Michael
J. Fox and Sean Penn ($13.7 million), and Dennis Quaid's ``Great
Balls of Fire'' ($13.7 million).
   Several industry observers have said the summer record was
sparked by higher ticket prices, with some theaters in New York and
Los Angeles charging $7 per admission.
   The studios countered that today's movies must compete with
pay-cable television and videocassette rentals.
   Warner Bros., propelled by ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon 2,''
led the studios in summer revenues. The studio accounted for 24
percent of all tickets sold.
   Disney, with no sequels and no overpublicized epics, quietly
claimed the No. 2 spot with its ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and
``Dead Poets Society.''
   Among the major studios, Tri-Star and MGM-UA had the most
miserable summers, finishing last and next-to-last, respectively.
