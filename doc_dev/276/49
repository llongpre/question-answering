   ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' were a winning combination in
the weekend box office sweepstakes, claiming first and second place
in ticket sales.
   The Star Trek movie grossed $17.4 million at the nation's
theaters and Indiana Jones attracted another $16 million in its
third week, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   Paramount's ``Star Trek V,'' directed by and starring William
Shatner, enjoyed the best opening weekend of any of the previous
``Star Trek'' movie adaptations.
   The studio's latest installment of Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana
Jones,'' surpassed the $100 million mark, making the Harrison Ford
comedy-adventure the fastest movie to pass the threshold.
   The summer movie season will enter full swing within the next
three weeks: ``Ghostbusters II'' opens on Friday, ``Batman'' arrives
on June 23 and ``Great Balls of Fire,'' ``Do the Right Thing'' and
``Karate Kid III'' will debut on June 30.
   In its first week of wide release, Robin Williams' ``Dead Poets
Society'' sold $7.5 million of tickets to finish in third place. In
fourth place was the Richard Pryor-Gene Wilder crime comedy ``See No
Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with receipts of $3.4 million.
   The Kevin Costner baseball film ``Field of Dreams'' landed in
fifth on grosses of $3.1 million. It was followed by the Hulk Hogan
wrestling film ``No Holds Barred'' falling to sixth place with a
gate of $2.9 million. ``Road House,'' with Patrick Swayze as a bar
bouncer, was seventh with $2.2 million.
   ``Renegades,'' a police movie starring Kiefer Sutherland and Lou
Diamond Phillips, finished in eighth with grosses of $1.6 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Pet Sematary'' in ninth with $1.5
million and ``K-9'' in 10th with $1.4 million. Clint Eastwood's
clunker ``Pink Cadillac'' dropped out of the Top 10, as did ``Major
League.''
