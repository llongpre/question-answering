"Born on the Fourth of July," "Glory," and "When Harry Met Sally" -- with five 
nominations each -- were the clear favorites this year among the Hollywood 
Foreign Press Assn., which announced the nominees for its annual Golden Globe 
Awards Wednesday morning in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Following close behind with four nominations each were 'Dead Poets Society," 
"Do the Right Thing" (tapped by the L.A. Film Critics as the year's best 
picture), and Disney's animated fairy tale, "The Little Mermaid." On the 
television side, NBC's "L.A. Law" walked away with eight nominations, while 
NBC's "Cheers" received four, and ABC's "thirtysomething" -- which won last 
year's Golden Globe Award for best dramatic series -- earned three. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular TV miniseries or made for TV movies were "Lonesome Dove," with 
four nominations, and "Roe vs. Wade," with three. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe Awards, which will be handed out Jan. 20, often provide a good 
indicator of what direction the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
will take in awarding its coveted Oscars each year. In the past 11 years, eight 
Golden Globe winners in the dramatic film category -- including last year's 
winner, "Rain Man" -- went on to win Academy Awards for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
The 84 Hollywood-based foreign reporters who voted did shut out a handful of 
films considered possible Oscar candidates, including two Holocaust-themed 
films, "Triumph of the Spirit" and "Enemies, a Love Story," whose director Paul 
Mazursky was named the year's best director last week by the New York Film 
Critics Cirle; Kenneth Branagh's widely acclaimed "Henry V," and Phil Alden 
Robinson's baseball fantasy, "Field of Dreams." The latter omission is not 
surprising because, as a rule, baseball films are rarely popular overseas -- 
"Field of Dreams" was no exception at the foreign box office. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe nominees for best dramatic picture were "Born on the Fourth of 
July," in which Tom Cruise portrays Vietnam vet Ron Kovic; Woody Allen's 
morality play, "Crimes and Misdemeanors"; "Dead Poets Society," starring Robin 
Williams as a teacher who brings his iconoclastic style to a strict boys prep 
school; "Do the Right Thing," Spike Lee's controversial look at the makings of 
an urban race riot, and "Glory," a Civil War film about the fate of an 
all-black regiment. 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the Fourth of July" also earned a best actor nomination for Cruise, a 
best director nomination for Oliver Stone, a best screenplay nomination for 
Stone and Kovic (on whose life the film is based), and a best original score 
nomination for John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Glory's" other nominees included Denzel Washington for his supporting role; 
Edward Zwick for direction; Kevin Jarre for his screenplay and James Horner for 
his original score. Another star of "Glory," Morgan Freeman, was overlooked for 
that film, but received a best actor nomination for his performance in "Driving 
Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe Awards touch a broader array of films than the Academy Awards 
because nominees are named in two separate motion-picture categories -- drama 
and musical/comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"When Harry Met Sally," a best picture nominee in the musical/comedy category, 
also earned nominations for stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, director Rob 
Reiner and screenwriter Nora Ephron. 
</P>
<P>
The other nominees for best musical/comedy were: "Driving Miss Daisy," which 
also drew a best actress nomination for Jessica Tandy; "Shirley Valentine," 
which garnered a best actress nomination for Pauline Collins; "The War of the 
Roses," which brought nominations for co-stars Kathleen Turner and Michael 
Douglas, and "The Little Mermaid," which earned another three nominations for 
its music. 
</P>
<P>
"My Left Foot," the New York film critics' choice as the year's best picture, 
was ignored in the best dramatic picture category. But its star, Daniel 
Day-Lewis, was nominated for best actor in a dramatic film. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Cruise and Day-Lewis, the foreign reporters nominated Jack 
Lemmon ("Dad"); Al Pacino ("Sea of Love"), and Robin Williams ("Dead Poets 
Society") in the best actor category for dramatic pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The best actors nominated in the musical/comedy category were Crystal, Douglas, 
Freeman, Steve Martin ("Parenthood") and Jack Nicholson ("Batman). 
</P>
<P>
The best actress nominees in the dramatic category were Sally Field ("Steel 
Magnolias"); Jessica Lange ("Music Box"); Andie MacDowell ("sex, lies and 
videotape"); Michelle Pfeiffer ("The Fabulous Baker Boys"), and Liv Ullmann 
("The Rose Garden.") 
</P>
<P>
Best actress nominees in the musical/comedy category were Collins, Ryan, Tandy, 
Turner and Meryl Streep ("She-Devil").
