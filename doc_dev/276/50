   ``Lethal Weapon 2'' and ``Batman'' held their
reign as the summer's box office champs while the romantic comedy
``When Harry Met Sally...'' hit third place in its first week of
wide release.
   ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover,
collected $13 million to finish in first place for the third
consecutive week, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   ``Batman'' grossed $11.2 million for second place. The megahit
now has made $187.5 million and is nearing $200 million _ a mark
only nine other films have eclipsed in Hollywood history.
   Director Rob Reiner's ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' featuring
Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as friends who become lovers, had ticket
sales of $8.8 million to finish in third. In fourth was the comedy
``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' which reported ticket sales of $6.4
million.
   ``Licence to Kill,'' the latest James Bond movie with Timothy
Dalton, was fifth with $5.1 million. The re-release of the animated
classic ``Peter Pan'' finished in sixth with $4.3 million.
   In seventh place was Robin Williams' bittersweet drama ``Dead
Poets Society'' with ticket sales of $3.5 million. It was followed
by Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' at
$3.4 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were the comedy sequel ``Ghostbusters
