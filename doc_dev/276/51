   CBS executive Laurence A. Tisch and publishing
mogul Malcolm Forbes are part of a corporate bridge team taking on
British parliamentarians as the lords of American finance meet real
British nobility.
   Sir Peter Emery of London and the selector Duke of Atholl will
co-captain the British Parliament team in the Feb. 23 match in
London, said Kathy Wei of the American Contract Bridge League.
   Ms. Wei, one of the top world bridge players, said Wednesday she
will be master of ceremonies for the event.
   The U.S. team also includes Alan Greenberg and James Cayne,
executives of Bear Stearns and Co. Inc.; Warren Buffett of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.; George Gillespie III, of the law firm of
Cravath, Swaine and Moore; and Milton Petrie, of Petrie Stores.
   The Britons include Kenneth Baker, a senior Cabinet member;

   Kathleen Battle, the American lyric soprano, is
making a hit at the Royal Opera House as Norina in a revival of
``Don Pasquale.''
   She was given a rapturous reception Monday night after her first
performance of the role in the comic work by Gaetano Donizetti.
   The Times of London called it an ``astute performance, with the
renowned Battle coloratura on full display with every note hit dead
center.''
   Miss Battle first appeared in Covent Garden in 1984 in Richard
Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos,'' and was the first American to win
the Laurence Olivier Award, an honor for best performance of a new
production.
   Miss Battle, wonderfully lively in the footlights, keeps to
herself offstage and has refused to pose for newspaper
photographers or give interviews during this visit.

   Diana, Princess of Wales, says ``very simple''
values can triumph over the complex difficulties encountered in
modern marriages.
   ``Sadly, for many of these marriages, reality fails to live up
to expectations. When that happens most couples discover and draw
on new reserves of love and strength,'' Diana said Wednesday. ``But
for many, their own resources are not enough.''
   The princess, patron of the marriage guidance organization
Relate, made her comments while presenting the charity's Family of
the Year award.
   The winners were Rico and Heather Gopaul, both 30, and children
Rico Jr., 7, Ryan, 6, Ricky, 3, and Rosita, 2. The mother and
father are nurses who care for mentally handicapped people.
   ``The award celebrates the victory of very simple values over
the very complex difficulties confronted by so many modern
marriages,'' said Diana, who married Prince Charles in 1981. The
couple has two sons.

   Transsexual Terri Pohrman is running
for mayor of this conservative town and making inroads among senior
citizens with the slogan, ``The Change Will Do You Good.''
   The former Las Vegas show girl was a regular entertainer at the
California Veterans' Home before she entered the race, but now the
home is a campaign stop _ more than 700 of the 1,800 registered
voters in this wine-country town live there.
   She visited the home last weekend wearing roller skates and a
tight body stocking with huge red cardboard hearts over her front
and back. Later, she donned a red sequined cocktail dress with a
plunging neckline.
   ``All the guys got a big kick out of her,'' said Gene Sockness,
61. ``She's really welcome up here and shows us a good time. So
what the heck, live and let live.''
   The big-shouldered blonde with spiky hair faces two opponents in
the April 10 election. Her ambitions have panicked some residents
of this town of 3,200 people, about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
   ``These people are scared,'' she said. ``They think I'll open a
bunch of massage parlors and adult bookstores.''
   Pohrman was a teen-age female impersonator before having a sex
change operation in in the 1970s.

   Actress Glenn Close scooped up another Ivy
League honor, this time from the Dartmouth Film Society, joining
Robert Redford and Lillian Gish as recipients of the organization's
award.
   ``I hope I can keep doing the kind of work that warrants this
overwhelming response,'' the actress said at Wednesday's ceremony
at Dartmouth College. ``It's deeply moving and I thank you from the
bottom of my heart.''
   Close, a five-time Academy Award nominee, made her film debut
opposite Robin Williams in 1982 in ``The World According to Garp.''
Since then, she has starred in such films as ``Fatal Attraction,''
and ``Dangerous Liaisons.''
   On Tuesday, Close received the Woman of the Year award from
Hasty Pudding Theatricals at Harvard University.

   Tom Schulman, who wrote ``Dead Poets
Society,'' is a little stunned to be in the company of Woody Allen
and Nora Ephron as a nominee for an Academy Award for best original
screenplay.
   He is competing with Allen, nominated for ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors''; Ephron (``When Harry Met Sally''); Spike Lee (``Do
the Right Thing'') and Steven Sonderburgh (``sex, lies, and
videotape'').
   ``My God, Woody Allen is one of my idols. I'm really proud to be
a part of that lineup,'' Schulman, who hails from Nashville, said
in an interview from his Los Angeles-area home.
