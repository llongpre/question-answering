   Hulk Hogan may be unbeatable in the wrestling
ring, but he's clearly no match for Indiana Jones.
   Hogan's new movie ``No Holds Barred'' was body slammed by
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which continued to break
box-office records by collecting another $21.2 million at the
nation's theaters over the weekend.
   According to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
``No Holds Barred'' gathered $5 million in its first weekend of
release.
   ``The Last Crusade,'' which set four major box-office marks in
its first week of release, broke two more records in its second
week and took in as much as the next six most popular movies
combined.
   The film, in which Harrison Ford as the dauntless archaeologist
joins his father (Sean Connery) to save the Holy Grail from the
Nazis, set new records for the best 12 days and best second weekend
in movie history. It could pass the $100 million mark next weekend
and shatter yet another record.
   ``No Holds Barred,'' a new action-adventure film featuring
wrestler Hogan, debuted in second place. ``See No Evil, Hear No
Evil,'' a crime comedy with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, landed
in third on ticket sales of $4.1 million.
   In fourth was the Kevin Costner baseball movie ``Field of
Dreams'' on gross of $3.7 million. It was followed by
``Renegades,'' starring Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips,
opening in fifth with $3.1 million. ``Road House,'' featuring
Patrick Swayze as a bar bouncer, placed sixth with $3 million.
   Continuing its sluggish pace, Clint Eastwood's ``Pink Cadillac''
collected only $2.5 million to land in seventh place. ``K-9,''
starring Jim Belushi and a dog as a police team, finished in eighth
with $1.8 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Pet Sematary,'' in ninth on gross
of $1.7 million, and ``Major League,'' in 10th with $963,636.
``Rain Man,'' a Top 10 movie for all of 1989, finally fell off the
leader board.
   Robin Williams' ``Dead Poets Society,'' playing on only eight
screens, collected a lively $340,456. Its per screen average _
$42,557 _ was the third best in the history of limited releases, in
which a movie opens in just a handful of theaters.
   The only films to surpass ``Dead Poets Society'' in a limited
release opening were ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``The Last
Temptation of Christ.''
