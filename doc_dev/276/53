   More summer box-office records were rewritten
during the long Fourth of July weekend on the strength of the hit
movies ``Batman'' and ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.''
   ``Batman,'' starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, grossed
$43.6 million over the five days, setting a mark for any movie over
the holiday period, according Exhibitor Relations Co.
   The film has sold $113.7 million worth of tickets in less than
two weeks.
   The Disney comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' was No. 2,
earning $20 million from Friday to Tuesday. It also had the best
Independence Day in Disney history for a single title, $3.1 million.
The earlier Disney mark was held by last summer's ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit.''
   ``Karate Kid III,'' the latest sequel in the wimp-turned-martial
arts champion saga, came in third at $14.3 million.
   In fourth place was ``Ghostbusters II,'' the comedy sequel
starring Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, with receipts of $13.1
million. In fifth was ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which
grossed $11.1 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society,'' a modern-day version of ``Goodbye Mr.
Chips'' featuring Robin Williams, was sixth with $10.1 million.
``Great Balls of Fire!'' made its debut in seventh place but
collected just $5.6 million in wide release.
   Playing in only 353 theaters, Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing''
grossed a healthy $5.2 million to land in eighth place.
   ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' was next with $3.7 million
and ``Field of Dreams'' finished 10th with $2.8 million.
