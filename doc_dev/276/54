Samuel F. Pickering, the inspiration for the offbeat prep schoolteacher played 
by Robin Williams in "Dead Poets Society," still has not seen the popular 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I didn't know who Robin Williams was," said Pickering, 
48, a professor of English literature at the University of Connecticut. "I 
finally saw him on TV the other day. He's a nut." 
</P>
<P>
Pickering, a Nashville native interviewed by phone from his home in Storrs, 
Conn., said he does not mind the celebrity the film has brought. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman walked up to me in the supermarket the other day and told me I was 
such an inspiration that she was giving up the insurance business to go back to 
being a schoolteacher," he said.
