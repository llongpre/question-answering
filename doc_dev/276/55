   With a record $2.05 billion in ticket sales,
Hollywood posted its best summer ever mainly on the strength of such
films as ``Batman'' and the family comedies ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids'' and ``Parenthood.''
   Memorial Day to Labor Day box-office revenues were up 20 percent
from last summer's record of $1.7 billion, with ``Batman'' emerging
as at least the sixth most successful film in movie history on
ticket sales in excess of $240 million.
   The top five movies alone combined for more than $750 million in
sales, according to figures released Tuesday.
   ``Nobody in the business can predict how big a movie goes once it
goes big,'' Rob Friedman, president of worldwide advertising and
publicity for Warner Bros., said of ``Batman's'' spectacular summer.
``Did we know `Batman' was going to be a big movie? Yes. Did we know
how big? You never know.''
   John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., which compiles
box-office figures, said that ``Batman's'' smash showing encouraged
audiences to explore the entire summer slate.
   ``And once people arrived, there was a little bit of everything
out there, great variety,'' he said.
   Among those contributing to the record season were adult
moviegoers, who in recent years have stayed at home. Although exact
figures are unavailable, it is believed older patrons boosted the
grosses of ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Parenthood'' and ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids.'
   The healthy summer season makes it likely that 1989 will break
last year's record of $4.46 billion.
   Five summer movies surpassed the $100 million mark: ``Batman,''
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($189.5 million); ``Lethal
Weapon 2'' ($131.3 million); ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' ($119.1
million) and ``Ghostbusters II'' ($109.9 million). Their combined
$788 million accounted for 40 percent of all summer tickets sold.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Dead Poets Society'' ($86.4
million); ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' ($66.6 million);
``Parenthood'' ($64.1 million); ``Turner &amp; Hooch'' ($57.1 million)
and ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' ($50.5 million).
   Among the high-powered flops were Clint Eastwood's ``Pink
Cadillac'' ($12.1 million); Sylvester Stallone's ``Lock Up'' ($19
million); Michael J. Fox's and Sean Penn's ``Casualties of War''
($14 million) and Dennis Quaid's ``Great Balls of Fire'' ($13.7
million).
   Several industry observers have pointed out that the summer
record was sparked by higher ticket prices, with some theaters in
New York and Los Angeles charging $7 for single admissions.
   But, the studios counter, today's movies must struggle for
audiences in a more competitive marketplace, fighting the broad
appeal of pay cable television and videocassette rentals.
   Among the studios, Warner Bros. led all comers during the summer,
with its ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon 2'' helping the studio
account for 24 percent of all tickets sold.
   Disney, with no sequels and no over-publicized epics, quietly
claimed the No. 2 spot with its ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and
``Dead Poets Society.''
   Among the major studios, Tri-Star and MGM-UA had the most
miserable summers, finishing last and next-to-last, respectively.
