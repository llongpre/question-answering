   Tales of two odd couples _ ``Turner and Hooch''
and ``Lethal Weapon 2'' _ topped the box-office charts, while
``Batman'' swooped past the $200 million mark.
   The Disney comedy ``Turner and Hooch,'' pairing Tom Hanks with a
slobbering dog named Beasely, collected $12.2 million in its first
weekend, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   Disney claimed three of the other Top 10 spots with ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Dead Poets Society'' and ``Peter Pan'' for a
total take of $21.8 million. It was among the best weekends in the
studio's history and the first time this year that one company has
had four films on the leader board, Disney officials said.
   In second place was ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' the action sequel
starring Mel Gibson as the manic partner of straight-arrow cop
Danny Glover. The film grossed $10.4 million and shows few signs of
fading away.
   The summer's most popular title, ``Batman,'' had receipts of $9
million and now has made $202.9 million. As of this week, it is the
ninth biggest hit in Hollywood history, and the first film to crack
the all-time Top 10 since ``Back to the Future'' in 1985.
   ``Batman'' now seems likely to pass such other megahits as
``Ghostbusters'' ($220 million), ``Beverly Hills Cop'' ($234
million), and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' ($242 million).
   In fourth place with $7.9 million was the romantic comedy ``When
Harry Met Sally...,'' featuring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as best
friends who over a dozen years come to be lovers. It was followed
by the return of ax-wielding Jason Voorhees in ``Friday the 13th
Part VIII,'' with $6.3 million.
   In sixth was the family comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,''
starring Rick Moranis, with ticket sales of $4.6 million. The
latest James Bond film, ``Licence to Kill,'' finished in seventh
with $3.4 million.
   Director Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade'' continued to chug along in eighth place, collecting $2.8
million. Rounding out the weekly Top 10 were ``Dead Poets Society''
in ninth with $2.6 million and ``Peter Pan'' in 10th with $2.3
million.
