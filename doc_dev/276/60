   ``Batman'' has passed such stellar hits as ``The
Exorcist,'' ``Gremlins'' and the original ``Superman'' to become the
highest-grossing film in Warner Bros. history.
   Although it finished second on the weekend box-office charts,
with receipts of $15.1 million, ``Batman'' has collected $167.6
million to date, and will almost certainly become this summer's
biggest hit, surpassing ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   Meanwhile, ``Lethal Weapon 2'' claimed the No. 1 spot for the
second consecutive week, leaving the new James Bond film ``Licence
to Kill'' reeling in its wake.
   ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as Los
Angeles policemen out to smash a South African money laundering
scheme, grossed $17.2 million nationwide to lead all other titles,
according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   In third place over the weekend was the Disney comedy ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids,'' which continues to attract waves of moviegoers.
``Honey,'' starring Rick Moranis, sold $8.806 million worth of
tickets, topping the opening of ``Licence to Kill.''
   The latest Bond film, starring Timothy Dalton, debuted weakly,
grossing $8.775 million to finish in fourth place. The last Bond
film, ``The Living Daylights,'' netted more than $11 million in its
opening weekend in 1987.
   In fifth was Disney's re-release of the animated ``Peter Pan,''
with sales of $5.6 million. It was followed in sixth by Steven
Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' with a gate of
$4.6 million.
   The comedy sequel ``Ghostbusters II,'' starring Bill Murray and
Dan Aykroyd, was seventh on proceeds of $4.33 million. In eighth was
Robin Williams in ``Dead Poets Society,'' which grossed $4.26
million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' with $3.7
million, place, and ``Do the Right Thing,'' with $3 million. The new
romantic comedy ``When Harry Met Sally...'' had a strong opening in
a limited release, selling $1.1 million worth of tickets in only 41
theaters.
