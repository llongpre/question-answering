   Ailing entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. basked in
an outpouring of appreciation from fans ranging from Michael
Jackson to Frank Sinatra at a tribute honoring his 60 years in show
business.
   The star-studded salute Monday night, a benefit for the United
Negro College Fund, included performances by Jackson, Sinatra,
Stevie Wonder and Whitney Houston.
   ``I thank you all from my heart,'' said Davis, 63, who is
undergoing radiation treatment for throat cancer. ``It's the
greatest night of my life.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Los Angeles Lakers basketball player
Magic Johnson joined the gathering, also attended by Bob Hope,
longtime Davis co-performer Dean Martin, Gregory Peck, Shirley
MacLaine, Henry Mancini, actor-dancer Gregory Hines and heavyweight
boxing champ Mike Tyson. Comedian Eddie Murphy was host.
   Davis began his career at age 3 performing with his father and
uncle in a song and dance group called the Will Mastin Trio.
   His throat cancer, found in September, is localized and he is
expected to recover. ``I got good word today from the doctor _
about four or five weeks of recovery and I'll be back yelling and
screaming again,'' he said.

   American film star Elizabeth Taylor
flew to the Thai resort island of Phuket for a rest Tuesday after
visiting AIDS patients in a Bangkok hospital.
   ``Ms. Taylor is tired after these past few days. She's not used
to the heat and she's had a lot of appointments and functions,''
said Sally Morrison, director of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research.
   Ms. Taylor, who chairs the foundation, visited three AIDS
patients at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University Hospital on Monday.
   ``Ms. Taylor was very distressed that the man in the middle bed
couldn't get the surgery he needed because no surgeon was willing
to operate for fear of getting AIDS,'' Ms. Morrison said.
   Ms. Taylor arrived in Thailand on Friday at the invitation of
Princess Chulabhorn, who directs an AIDS research institute and
leads Thailand's fight against the deadly disease.

   Charges have been refiled against a man
suspected of trying to burglarize the Bel Air hotel room of actors
Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith earlier this year, prosecutors
said Monday.
   The original felony charges filed against Henry Kenneth
Rosenbaum, also known as David Barton Johnson, were dropped when
the couple were unable to testify at Rosenbaum's Sept. 20
preliminary hearing.
   Rosenbaum, serving a jail sentence for possessing burglary
tools, pleaded innocent Monday to the refiled charges.
   The complaint charges that when the couple returned to their
hotel room on Jan. 29, they found Rosenbaum going through
Griffith's purse, which contained expensive jewelry.
   Johnson, star of the television police program ``Miami Vice,''
grabbed Rosenbaum and held him until hotel security arrived.

   Actor Tom Hulce has tried to put down roots, but
his busy schedule on film and stage is getting in the way.
   The star of ``Amadeus'' and co-star in the recent
``Parenthood,'' appearing here in the new play ``A Few Good Men,''
says he bought a house in Seattle, which he grew to love while
performing there a year ago in ``Eastern Standard.''
   ``I've only lived in it long enough to prepare the ground for a
garden,'' he said. ``I invited my family out to see it last summer,
and they got there, but I didn't.''
   He was working on a film in Georgia at the time.
   ``And now, I'm not sure when I'll be able to get out there. If
the play is lucky, we'll be here 'till spring. Then I'll be six
months in Russia on a film.
   ``I don't think I'll be back out until maybe a year from
Christmas.''

   Samuel F. Pickering, the inspiration for
the offbeat prep school teacher played by Robin Williams in ``Dead
Poets Society,'' still hasn't seen the popular movie.
   ``To tell you the truth, I didn't know who Robin Williams was,''
said Pickering, 48, a professor of English literature at the
University of Connecticut. ``I finally saw him on TV the other day.
He's a nut.''
   Pickering, 48, a Nashville native interviewed by phone from his
home in Storrs, Conn., said he doesn't mind the celebrity the film
has brought.
   ``A woman walked up to me in the supermarket the other day and
told me I was such an inspiration that she was giving up the
insurance business to go back to being a schoolteacher,'' he said.
   ``I feel terrible about it. She probably made a lot of money in
insurance.''
