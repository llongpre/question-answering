   ``Batman'' soared into the box office
stratosphere by becoming the first movie to make $100 million within
10 days.
   ``Batman'' grossed a record $30.1 million during its second
weekend of release, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
   ``Batman,'' starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack
Nicholson as his comic antagonist, the Joker, set the previous
weekend mark with $42.7 million in its first three days.
   If it continues on its winged way, ``Batman'' could well become
the highest-grossing movie yet, topping the $228.6 million set by
1982's ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.''
   The former record-holder for the fastest $100 million was
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which passed the barrier
after 19 days last month.
   Meanwhile, Spike Lee's much talked-about ``Do the Right Thing''
generated vigorous business in its debut. The emotional and often
comic race-relations drama collected $3.6 million while playing in
only several hundred theaters.
   ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' the family comedy starring Rick
Moranis, held strongly in second place, grossing $13.1 million
during the weekend.
   In third, selling $10.4 million worth of tickets during its
opening weekend, was the critically panned ``The Karate Kid Part
III,'' starring 27-year-old Ralph Macchio.
   In fourth place was the fading comedy ``Ghostbusters II,'' with
Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, which dropped from $13.9 million one
weekend ago to $9 million this past weekend. It was followed by
Steven Spielberg's adventure sequel ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' landing in fifth with $7.1 million.
   The bittersweet coming-of-age drama ``Dead Poets Society''
starring Robin Williams continued to draw large crowds, collecting
$6.7 million to finish in sixth place.
   The much-hyped but poorly reviewed ``Great Balls of Fire!''
opened to spectacularly bad business, winding up in seventh place.
Despite its exclamation point, ``Great Balls of Fire!'' collected
only $3.8 million.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' on only 353 screens, grossed $3.6 million
to finish in eighth place. Universal has yet to announce if it will
add more screens for ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Rounding out the top 10 were William Shatner's ``Star Trek V: The
Final Frontier'' in ninth with $2.5 million, and the baseball
fantasy ``Field of Dreams,'' featuring Kevin Costner, in 10th with
$1.8 million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor

screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
