<LEADPARA>  JUST as European audiences once thought of Hollywood action pictures as
synonymous with Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson, Americans have come to
associate quality French films with the name Gerard Depardieu. Just roll it
off your tongue -- JAY-rard DE-par-dew -- and you feel as if you're speaking
French.;    Do a quick scroll of the great French films of the last 15 years
-- "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs," "The Return of Martin Guerre," "Danton" and
"Jean de Florette," among them -- and you're bound to come up with a Depardieu
vehicle or two. Since making his screen debut in 1965 in a short and an
unfinished adaptation of "Christmas Carol" by Agnes Varda, the actor has
appeared in, by his own estimation, "almost 80 films." And he's only 42! Not
even the old-time Hollywood greats -- the Cagneys and the Bogarts -- could
boast of such filmography.  </LEADPARA>

FRANCE'S BURLY GERARD DEPARDIEU POISED FOR
STATESIDE STARDOM  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Depardieu -- the very personification of the bearish bohemian -- obviously
likes to work. And over the years he has sought out and been sought out by his
country's best  filmmakers, including Claude Berri, Alan Resnais, Bertrand
Blier and the late Francois Truffaut, for whom he made "The Last Metro" and
"The Woman Next Door.";    And yet, for all his notoriety, Depardieu has
remained a hero of the art-house cognoscenti. France's burly man of the street
-- part poet, part stevedore -- hasn't caught on with Mr. and Mrs. Average
Filmgoer.;    But that could change in '91.;    Depardieu is now appearing in
the thinking man's swashbuckler, "Cyrano de Bergerac," and is making his
Hollywood debut in a robust romantic comedy called "Green Card" (arriving
locally Friday). As Cyrano, he brings his energy and signature bullheadedness
to a whole new audience. There is even talk of an Oscar nomination. As George
Faure, the French composer in "Green Card" who marries a New York botanist to
get around immigration laws, he gets to speak broken English and work his
mulish charm on co-star Andie MacDowell (of "sex, lies &amp; videotape").;    Then
Depardieu is set to return in early February in the restored, five-hour
version of "1900," directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and first released in 1976.
Depardieu co-starred opposite Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland and Burt
Lancaster. (The epic celebration of Italian socialism, to be rated NC-17 in
its new form, begins a limited run at San Francisco's Castro Theater Feb. 1.);
   Liked film's simplicity;  With an occasional assist from a young
translator, the actor talked recently about his unusual work methods and the
decision to at long last "go Hollywood." He was drawn to "Green Card" because
of its simplicity and because it had been tailor-designed for him (by
director-writer Peter Weir of "Dead Poets Society"). "It's a beautiful
situation," he began, reaching for another pungent Gitane. "I like the idea of
a man who goes to New York and has to marry a woman to stay in the country. It
is simple, uncomplicated. Also, I love Peter Weir. I was very impressed that
this man who didn't know me wrote a script for me on the other side of the
planet.";    Actually, Australian Weir rewrote the script with Depardieu in
mind. The romantic comedy had been gathering dust in a bottom drawer for
several years. It wasn't until Weir saw Depardieu in "Danton" and Weir's wife
suggested a few changes (the protagonist was originally a British film buff in
Hollywood) that the project was resurrected. The character may be named George
Faure, but he's really Depardieu, right down to the provincial upbringing, the
dagger tattoo on his right forearm, the early scrapes with gendarmes and time
in reform school.;    The shady past George describes to McDowell's Bronte is
Depardieu's past.;    "I got this when I was 12 years old," the actor said,
pulling up his sleeve to reveal the dagger tattoo. "I wanted to be strong,
tough. I was angry about everything. All of my tattoos mean something. The
knife tattoo means that you were reported by someone and have sworn to have
revenge.";    Weighty issue;  There are even references to Depardieu's
considerable waistline. In the movie, a joke is made of George's refusal to
own up to his weight. Depardieu isn't as vain. "I am now 200 pounds. I weighed
250 during 'Cyrano.' I had trouble moving in the sword fights. It's the wine.
The wine opens your appetite. Now I eat steamed vegetables and a little
chicken.";    "Originally, the concept for 'Green Card' didn't work," Weir
explained later. "It was neither funny nor romantic, but labored, contrived.
When I changed the setting to New York and made the hero a Frenchman, it
started to come together. I constructed George to reflect the qualities I've
loved most in Gerard's work -- the humor, the roughness, the physicality. It
was purely and simply written for Gerard.";    Six weeks later Weir had a
script but doubted that Depardieu would be attainable. "If he hadn't made a
picture in English at age 40, I reasoned, he either didn't want to or he
didn't speak English well enough.";    Not fluent in English;  Weir discussed
the project with Depardieu by phone, then sent him the script, which was
translated and recorded on an audio cassette. They talked again.;    "I put
the phone down with clammy hands," the director recalled. "His English was
pretty bad and my French wasn't much better. But at least we could
communicate. He said he liked the fact that the character was a foreigner, not
an American, and that he would only have to speak enough English to seesaw
thorough the language.";    So they met in Paris and "sealed the deal . . . We
got on immediately," said Weir.;    Unfortunately, Depardieu's legendary
workload got in the way. Besides the upcoming "Cyrano," he had two other
feature commitments. He wouldn't be free for another 18 months. "It was a
major disappointment," Weir recalled. "I had no option but to say, 'I'll
wait.' ";    Weir went on to "Dead Poets Society" and further acclaim.
Depardieu did Blier's "Thanks, Life," Berri's "Uranus" (about the French
resistance in the last days of World War II) and "Cyrano," which was filmed in
four months in Hungary and earned Depardieu the best actor award at last
year's Cannes festival. "Cyrano," at $20 million, is the most expensive French
production to date. Typically, Depardieu was involved years before the cameras
started rolling.;    That's how he prefers it. He sees himself as packager and
creative producer as well as star.;    "I'm not just an actor," he said. "The
acting is the last part I have to do. It's a piece of cake. More exciting for
me is the development. I propose an idea and give writers the money to develop
it. Sometimes I work for years with a writer and nothing happens. I
commissioned a writer to give me a treatment of Balzac's 'Colonel Chabert.' He
went away for a year and returned with a treatment we didn't use.";   
Depardieu said he works so much because "I am -- how do you say? -- hungry at
life. I eat the life.";    And it's this near-feverish zest that comes through
in "Cyrano" and "Green Card." Depardieu's specific appeal can be chalked up to
one element -- "unpredictability, both in life and on screen," said Weir.
"That's his greatest quality. You're never certain what he might do next. . .
. There are some very funny things that aren't in the film because they tilted
the character toward the buffoonish. There was a whole thing in the shower
with Bronte's potted plants that was hysterical.";    Depardieu's biggest
laugh-getter -- wherein he literally pounds out an impromptu composition on a
grand piano -- did make it to the final cut. It's the actor at his most
roguish and resourceful.;    In Weir's mind, the rather light and predictable
"Green Card" could only have worked with two actors -- Depardieu or the
middle-aged Spencer Tracy. "But Tracy is dead and I don't know if he could
have mastered the accent.";    Depardieu shrugs off Hollywood's awe over his
immense body of work. He points to Gene Hackman, Nick Nolte and Michael Caine
as other actors who keep busy. "I don't think (the amount of work) is so
amazing," he went on. "Except for 'Cyrano' and 'Jean de Florette,' I make
small movies. It's not the same way Americans make movies. When they accept
movies they have beaucoup travail -- they work much more.";    Depardieu
doesn't have time to ponder such things. He must return to Paris to oversee
production on a farce called "Mon Pere." He plays a single father on vacation
with his precocious teen-age daughter. "It's a little comedy, but a good one .
. . a very good concept. Everyone thinks my 14-year-old daughter is my
lover.";    Depardieu thinks he's a long shot for an Oscar nomination this
year. He does note, however, that Jose Ferrer won in 1950 for his portrayal of
Cyrano de Bergerac and that version was a lot less popular than the new French
adaptation. "That was very stagy, claustrophobic . . . the audience was not
into classics then. In mine, I didn't wear the long, exaggerated nose because
I didn't want to be a caricature. Ours is closer to a romantic epic, like
Hollywood makes.";    Weir is more optimistic about Depardieu's chances. "I
think he'll be nominated for 'Cyrano,' but 'Green Card' will keep the
spotlight on him. Each movie will stimulate the other. 'Cyrano' is the grander
work; it's an Academy film.";    Even if the Academy does smile on the
foreigner (no actor in a foreign-language film has ever won in the best-actor
category), don't expect him to file for a green card work permit. "Maybe if I
were more fluent in English. For now I think I will just visit when I see
something I really want to do."  </TEXT>
