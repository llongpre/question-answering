   North America's movie theaters reaped a
record $5 billion-plus at the box office in 1989, powered by the
punch of ``Batman'' and other highly promoted action films.
   Despite a lackluster Christmas holiday season, summertime
moviegoers spun the turnstiles at such a dizzying pace that the
box-office record of $4.45 billion from 1988 was smashed, according
to figures released Tuesday.
   The box-office total, based on industry estimates, was set by
fewer films: 446 features made their debuts in 1989, down 13
percent from the previous year.
   In the studio-by-studio race, Warner Bros. was No. 1 with an
estimated 17.1 percent share of all U.S. and Canadian tickets sold.
   The studio's ``Batman'' was the year's biggest blockbuster. Its
$251.2 million in ticket sales was fifth-highest in history.
   Disney, which some analysts didn't expect to be competitive,
finished fifth with a healthy 13.8 percent share.
   Although part of the revenue surge is attributable to higher
ticket prices, admissions are projected to be greater than last
year.
   In large part, the record year was propelled by expensive and
heavily marketed star vehicles such as ``Batman,'' and ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which made $196 million and ``Lethal
Weapon 2,'' which collected $147 million, according to trade
publications and private research firms.
   Right behind, the lightly regarded ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids''
emerged as 1989's No. 4 film with receipts of $130 million. It was
followed by the 1988 holdover ``Rain Man'' $127 million.
   ``I think `Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' was a terrific surprise for
us,'' said David Hoberman, president of Walt Disney Pictures and
its Touchstone Pictures division. ``I think there is a market for
good, original films.''
   ``Both `Honey' and `Dead Poets Society' were out there competing
with a lot of sequels and enormous budget films and they competed
pretty nicely in that marketplace.''
   The rest of the year's top 10 were ``Ghostbusters II,'' $112
million; ``Look Who's Talking,'' $109 million; ``Parenthood,'' $95
million; Touchstone's ``Dead Poets Society,'' $94 million; and
``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' $91 million.
   Owing partly to cold weather and that Christmas fell on a
Monday, this year's holiday season was off from a year ago. The
scarce hits included ``Back to the Future Part II'' and ``National
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.''
   The box-office figures only hint at the film industry's robust
health. Home video and cable television receipts now account for
about 57 percent of studio revenues, compared with about 30 percent
earned at movie houses, according to Paul Kagan Associates.
   Some analysts believe Hollywood's record year might mean studios
will produce and release fodder. ``Most of these movies never
should have been made,'' said A.D. Murphy, who follows box-office
revenues for Daily Variety.
   Of 1989's top five, only ``Rain Man,'' released first in 1988,
was widely praised by reviewers. And several critically acclaimed
films, such as ``Do the Right Thing,'' ``The Fabulous Baker Boys''
and ``Heathers'' _ did modest business.
   Among independent films, the top performers were ``sex, lies and
videotape'' with $24 million and ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown'' with more than $7 million.
   The year's biggest flops include ``Casualties of War,''
``Blaze,'' ``We're No Angels,'' ``Old Gringo,'' ``Fat Man and
Little Boy,'' ``Lock-Up,'' ``The Abyss,'' ``Young Einstein'' and
just about every movie from the Orion studios: ``She-Devil,''
``Valmont,'' ``Great Balls of Fire,'' ``Erik the Viking'' and
``Heart of Dixie.''
   A companion survey conducted by Orbit Video magazine of the
decade's biggest box-office stars revealed a mildly surprising name
as the era's most popular actor: Harrison Ford. Ford's movies,
according to the magazine's January survey, made $1.064 billion.
   Dan Aykroyd, owing much to the two ``Ghostbusters'' movies and a
brief appearance in ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,'' was
second with $871 million. Eddie Murphy was third with $828 million.
Bill Murray's work generated ticket sales of $696 million for
fourth place and Tom Cruise was fifth with $636 million.
   The top actress was Kim Basinger in 15th place overall with
combined sales of $432 million.
