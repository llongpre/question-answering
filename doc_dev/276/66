   ``Parenthood'' weaned viewers from gimmicky
blockbusters and the fifth movie this summer topped the $100
million revenue mark, setting a record.
   Universal's paen to parenting, featuring Steve Martin under Ron
Howard's direction, brought in $10.5 million over the weekend,
Exhibitor Relations Co. reported Monday.
   The Tom Hanks-and-pooch love story ``Turner and Hooch'' was
second with $8.5 million dollars, followed by ``Lethal Weapon 2''
at $8 million.
   The romance didn't fade for ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' fourth
at $7.3 million. ``Batman'' was next with $6.7 million and
Sylvester Stallone brought in $6 million with the debut of ``Lock
Up'' at No. 6.
   Disney's ``Turner and Hooch'' was one of the studio's three Top
10 films, along with ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' at No. 7 with $4
million and ``Dead Poets Society'' at No. 10 with $2.1 million.
   Warner, like Disney, had three of the top 10 films with the No.
8-debuting ``Young Einstein'' at $3 million joining ``Lethal'' and
``Batman.'' Also in the Top 10 was Paramount's ``Friday the 13th
Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan'' in ninth place at $2.5 million.
   The blockbusters made room for `sex, lies &amp; videotape,'' the
Golden Palm winner at the Cannes Film Festival. In limited release,
`sex' took in $60,000 at New York's Cinema Studio to break the
house record of $41,000, and collected $90,600 at three Los Angeles
sites, with all evening shows sold out.
   ``Honey'' joined four other films surpassing the $100 million
mark this summer. The season's most popular film, Warner Bros.'
``Batman,'' has brought in $214.3 million.
   The others are ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' which has collected $102.1
million; Paramount's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' with
$180.5 million and Columbia's ``Ghostbusters II'' with $104.5
million. The latter two films have dropped out of the Top 10.
   The previous record-holder was 1984, when four films broke the
$100 million mark. They were ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom''; ``Ghostbusters''; ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and ``Gremlins.''
