   ``Batman'' made more money in three days than
most movies generate in their lifetimes, with a $42.7 million
opening that broke a week-old record and drove the industry to a
record $90 million-plus weekend.
   Despite attracting less-than-overwhelming reviews, ``Batman,''
starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack Nicholson as the
Joker, set new marks for the best opening day with $15.3 million
Friday, according to figures released Monday. It also recorded the
biggest Saturday at $14.6 million and Sunday at $12.7 million in
movie history.
   Those figures were rounded off; the exact figures yielded the
$42.7 million gross, according to John Krier of Exhibitor Relations
Co., which tracks box-office performance.
   The previous opening-weekend record was set a week earlier by
``Ghostbusters II,'' which grossed $29.5 million.
   Overall, American and Canadian movie fans spent more than $95
million at theaters during the weekend, breaking yet another record
by $3 million.
   ``This is tremendous. It is the biggest weekend ever in the
history of the business,'' said Krier.
   This summer's box office is now running 14 percent ahead of last
year's record season of $1.7 billion, according to industry
estimates. Grosses have been boosted by higher ticket prices, up to
$7 in some theaters.
   The unprecedented popularity of Warner Bros.' ``Batman'' may even
have helped the competition, as moviegoers _ perhaps frustrated by
unbearably long ``Batman'' lines at some of its 2,194 screens _
dashed to Disney's modest comedy, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' in
record numbers.
   ``Honey,'' which is being shown with a new 7{-minute Roger Rabbit
cartoon called ``Tummy Trouble,'' collected $14.3 million in its
first weekend to finish in second place. It broke all of Disney's
opening box-office records, including those set by its hits
``Cocktail'' and ``Three Men and a Baby.''
   The Disney production enjoyed the third-best opening weekend of
any non-sequel movie, trailing only ``Batman'' and ``Beverly Hills
Cop,'' the studio said.
   The most noticeable victim of the ``Batman'' and ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids'' onslaught was Columbia's ``Ghostbusters II,'' with
Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, which fell sharply after its record
opening. Finishing third on the box-office charts, ``Ghostbusters
II'' grossed $13.9 million, a collapse of more than 52 percent.
   In fourth place was Paramount's ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' which grossed $8.2 million. It was followed in fifth
place by Disney's ``Dead Poets Society,'' $7.3 million, featuring
Robin Williams as a crusading high-school teacher.
   ``We are so excited about that picture,'' said Richard Cook,
Disney's president of distribution. ``With `Indiana Jones,' `Star
Trek,' `Ghostbusters' and `Batman,' to have this movie performing at
the level that it is .... It's going to be around for a long, long
time.''
   In sixth was ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' the William
Shatner-directed sequel that seems overwhelmed by the summer
competition. After opening strongly two weeks ago, ``Star Trek V''
grossed only $3.7 million over the weekend.
   Universal's baseball movie ``Field of Dreams,'' with Kevin
Costner, landed in seventh with ticket sales of $2.1 million. In
eighth was the comedy ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with estimated
grosses of $1.6 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Road House'' with $913,000 and
``No Holds Barred'' with $808,000.

Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
