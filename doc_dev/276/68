   ``Ghostbusters II'' zapped through a record by
collecting $29.4 million in its first three days as the summer of
'89 kept going like gangbusters at the nation's box offices.
   The Columbia Studios' film's $8.3 million on Sunday was the
biggest non-holiday Sunday ever, according to Exhibitor Relations
Inc., which tallies box-offce receipts.
   ``We are thrilled with the opening weekend's record breaking
results and we anticipate that `Ghostbusters II' will play very
strongly in the coming weeks,'' said Columbia's new chief, Dawn
Steel.
   The previous three-day record was set earlier this month by
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which earned $21.2 million
in its second week.
   It also easily topped Columbia's previous three-day record of
$13.6 million for ``Ghostbusters'' in June 1984.
   Since the debut of Bill Murray's and Dan Aykroyd's paranormal
investigators, Columbia has been spooked by several cinematic
clunkers, most recently ``True Believer,'' ``The Adventures of Baron
Munchausen'' and ``Physical Evidence.''
   The company's only hit in recent years was 1987's ``La Bamba.''
   The true test for `Ghostbusters II'' comes Friday, when it will
compete with the much-hyped ``Batman.''
   Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' kept up
its charge, selling $11.7 million in tickets last weekend to claim
second place on the box-office charts. In just four weeks, it has
grossed more than $122 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society,'' the bittersweet prep school drama, earned
$9.1 million to pass ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' and move
into third place.
   ``Star Trek V,'' the first film directed by star William Shatner,
slipped badly from first to fourth place on sales of $7.1 million.
   In fifth was ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with Richard Pryor
and Gene Wilder, with $2.5 million. The baseball movie ``Field of
Dreams,'' starring Kevin Costner, finished in sixth with $2.4
million. In seventh was the wrestling film ``No Holds Barred,'' with
$1.7 million.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Road House,'' with $1.5 million,
``Pet Sematary'' with $1.2 million and ``K-9'' with $1 million.
   Since Memorial Day weekend, weekend box office revenues have
grossed $247.3 million, compared with $220 million for the period
last year, an increase of 11 percent, said John Krier of Exhibitor
Relations Inc., which tallies the box-office receipts.
   ``The gross isn't distributed quite the same,'' he said. ``Last
year there were more pictures playing and the gross was more evenly
distributed. This year the grosses are concentrated in the top two
or three movies.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of screens,
average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release.
