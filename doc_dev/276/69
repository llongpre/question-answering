   The cop buddy team of Mel Gibson and Danny
Glover proved lethal in the weekend box office sweepstakes with
``Lethal Weapon II'' drop-kicking ``Batman'' from atop the
box-office charts.
   ``Great Balls of Fire!,'' the rockumentary about musician Jerry
Lee Lewis, collapsed to 10th place in its second week.
   According to box-office figures released Monday, ``Lethal Weapon
II'' grossed more on Saturday alone ($7.8 million) than the original
``Lethal Weapon'' made during its entire first weekend in 1987.
   The sequel sold $20.4 million worth of tickets last weekend.
   For ``Batman,'' the caped crusader brought in $19.2 million last
weekend, but fell out of the top spot for the first time since the
movie's June 23 premiere.
   In third place was the Disney comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids,'' which drew $9.4 million to pass $50 million. In fourth was
the comedy sequel ``Ghostbusters II'' with Bill Murray, on sales of
$5.3 million.
   The Steven Spielberg-directed ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade'' finished in fifth, collecting $5.205 million. ``Dead Poets
Society,'' the bittersweet drama starring Robin Williams, landed in
sixth place with $5.186 million.
   In seventh, falling sharply from its opening weekend, was
``Karate Kid III,'' with sales of $4.9 million. Right behind was the
new comedy ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' which collected $4.5 million
during the weekend but $6.4 million since opening on Wednesday.
   Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' finished in ninth with $2.9
million. ``Great Balls of Fire!'' netted only $2.2 million.
