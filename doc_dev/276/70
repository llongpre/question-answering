   Steven Spielberg's production company has
pledged a conditional $100,000 to help the financially ailing Los
Angeles Theatre Center.
   The grant from Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment Co. is unusual in
that 95 percent of the theater's donations last year came from
lawyers, doctors and accountants, according to screenwriter Frank
Pierson, a member of the theater's board of directors.
   Amblin Entertainment will donate the money if six other Hollywood
companies match the offer, Pierson said. The grants will go into a
new endowment fund.
   Amblin's gift was initiated when Pierson chatted with Harrison
Ford, star of Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones'' movies, at a recent
dinner party.
   ``We were talking about the plight of non-profit theater across
the country,'' said Pierson, who wrote the screenplay for Ford's
next movie, ``Presumed Innocent.'' Ford approached Spielberg and
Amblin offered the $100,000.
   The Los Angeles Theatre Center, opened in 1985, has a deficit of
$1.04 million.

   Ryan White has a pretty good idea who
anonymously gave him a shiny new red Mustang this week _ pop star
Michael Jackson.
   White, a 17-year-old AIDS victim, picked up his new car on
Wednesday and was told it was a gift from a mysterious benefactor.
But the evidence points to Jackson.
   ``When you deal with Michael, there are four or five people you
have to go through before you get to Michael,'' said White's mother,
Jeanne. ``It was hard not to know when they called and asked, `Now
what was the car that Ryan told Michael he liked?'''
   White drew national attention several years ago when school
officials tried to keep him out of junior high because he has AIDS,
contracted from tainted blood he received in a treatment for
hemophilia. The family later moved from Kokomo to Cicero, and he now
is a junior in Hamilton Heights High School.
   ``Michael has called Ryan some 15 times since their friendship
began, and they talk for about 45 minutes,'' Mrs. White said. ``Most
of the time they talk about cars, something Ryan is very interested
in.''
   She said Ryan wants to take his car to an upcoming car show.
   ``He wants to customize it, which I think is a good idea; it will
keep him busy,'' Mrs. White said.

   Conductor Riccardo Muti's baton will be
waving over the Philadelphia Orchestra for some time _ his contract
as music director has been extended indefinitely.
   Under the terms of the new agreement, which the Philadelphia
Orchestra Association announced Tuesday, Muti's contract initially
will be extended through the 1991-92 season. It will be renewed
automatically each year by mutual agreement.
   Muti will continue to conduct at least one third of the
subscription concerts at the Academy of Music, special concerts in
Philadelphia and New York and tours both in the United States and
abroad.
   Muti, a native of Naples, Italy, became music director in
Philadelphia in 1980. He became music director of La Scala opera
house in Milan, Italy, in 1986.

   Screenwriter Tom Schulman, who wrote the
script for the ``Dead Poets Society'' starring Robin Williams, says
the motion picture is not drawn from his own experiences as a
private school student.
   Schulman attended Nashville's Montgomery Bell Academy and then
Vanderbilt University here.
   The movie, which opens today across the country, is about a
fictitious boys' prep school in Vermont, called Welton Academy. The
harmony of the strait-laced, conformist school is disturbed when
Williams arrives to teach English.
   ``Since I did go to a `good' private prep school, I guess it
would be natural to assume that much of the story is based on my
experience there,'' Schulman said. ``That just isn't true.
   ``I have a very positive memory of my years at MBA,'' he added.

   Rock star Jon Bon Jovi's parents have
started a scholarship named after their son to help aspiring artists
attending his old high school.
   John and Carol Bongiovi said Thursday the ``Jon Bon Jovi Dare To
Dream Scholarship'' will be awarded to artistic students at
Sayreville War Memorial High School. They would not disclose how
much money was involved in the scholarship.
   Mrs. Bongiovi said potential scholarship recipients didn't
necessarily have to be rock 'n' roll singers: ``It could be a kid
who likes to hammer the piano all day long and is driving everybody
nuts.''
   The family will provide initial seed money for the scholarship
fund, which will be supplemented by fund-raising events organized by
students, said Jim Robinson, a school planning board chairman.

   Former Miss America Kaye Lani Rae
Rafko, who spent most of a day hopping airplanes to get here, said a
welcoming crowd of about 100 people was ``quite a surprise for a
has-been.''
   Ms. Rafko, who caught three planes to get to Lee Bird Field, was
given flowers upon her arrival on Wednesday. She was in North Platte
to attend the Miss Nebraska pageant.
   ``It takes a while to get here. You're kind of tucked away,'' Ms.
Rafko told Mayor Jim Kirkman at the airport. She added, however, ``a
crowd like this is quite a surprise for a has-been. But, as the
saying goes, once a Miss America, always a Miss America.''
   Kirkman led a delegation of civic leaders who met the 1988 Miss
America. Her trip began with a flight from Toledo, Ohio, near her
hometown of Monroe, Mich. She had a layover in Chicago before flying
to Denver, where she caught her flight to North Platte.
