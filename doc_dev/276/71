   With two Top 10 movies and a bustling new
studio tour in Florida, The Walt Disney Co. already is having a hot
summer.
   A 7{-minute appearance by Roger Rabbit, the '80s answer to Mickey
Mouse, is helping pack families in for showings of Disney's ``Honey,
I Shrunk the Kids.''
   Robin Williams, whose risque brand of humor probably would have
made the late Walt Disney blush, is pulling a whole different
audience for ``Dead Poets Society.''
   And the Disney-MGM Studios tour outside Orlando puts the
granddaddy of amusement park companies at the forefront of the
latest trend in fun factories by taking customers backstage to play
at movie-making.
   It's the new Disney _ one that repulsed a raid on the Magic
Kingdom of the business world five years ago, revved up a plan to
make movies for older audiences and devised new ways to wring
billions out of a familiar lineup of animated characters and
amusement parks.
   With fine-tuning, that remains the formula for the future, said
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``To me it's not what next, but what's not next,'' Eisner said in
an interview. ``We have plenty to do with the Disney franchise, with
the Disney attractions, with the Disney image, to keep us occupied
for 20 years. We don't have to go out and prove that size is
better.''
   Fostering the franchise has paid off. Disney's earnings rose 17
percent last year to $522 million on sales of $3.4 billion. In the
first half of this year, earnings totaled $149 million on sales of
$1 billion. (The second half is bigger because of summer park
visitors and movies.)
   The amusement parks _ Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. and Disney
World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., _ are Disney's biggest moneymakers,
accounting for more than half its sales and earnings.
   But the big story of the last few years is movies, particularly
the young adult-oriented films produced by Disney's Touchstone
Pictures studio.
   Movies like ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Cocktail'' and ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit'' propelled Disney to the top spot in the box
office derby last year for the first time. Disney movies captured
19.4 percent of the nation's ticket sales, ahead of Paramount at
15.2 percent, 20th Century Fox at 11.6 percent and Warner Bros. at
11.2 percent.
   The company's two early entries this summer _ the traditional
Disney family comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and Touchstone's
``Dead Poets Society'' _ have drawn scant media attention, partly
because of the hoopla over blockbusters like ``Batman'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   But both are making enough to put them among the top 10
box-office attractions. ``Honey,'' which is preceded by the Roger
Rabbit cartoon ``Tummy Trouble,'' set a Disney record by collecting
$14.3 million its opening weekend.
   Hollywood is impressed with Disney's shrewd marketing, its move
to sign a stable of young stars like Bette Midler and Tom Cruise,
and an unusual emphasis on containing production costs.
   During the movie and television scriptwriters' strike last year,
union negotiators saw Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg as
their nemesis on the producers' joint negotiating group.
   In TV, the company also is mixing the old with the new. ``Golden
Girls'' and ``Empty Nest'' supplement broadcast staples. The boom in
home video is a boon to Disney with its library of children's
favorites and new features.
   In the fiercely competitive amusement park business, new
attractions are crucial, and Disney's bid for glory this year is the
studio tour in Florida. The $400 million addition to the Magic
Kingdom and Epcot Center includes peeks at working movie studios, a
re-creation of the Hollywood Boulevard in ts 1930s heyday and a
do-it-yourself music video.
   The company declines to release attendance figures for its parks,
but insiders say crowds at the new studio tour in Florida are
running above expectations. The company gets royalties from Tokyo
Disneyland and is lining up funding for a planned park outside Paris.
   Rival MCA Inc., which battles Disneyland for tourist dollars in
Southern California with a tour at its Universal Studios, plans to
open its Florida studio as an attraction next year and is
considering a European park.
   But analysts downplay the competition.
   For one thing, the worldwide demand for fun appears insatiable.
Then there's what has become known as the Disney magic: The
seemingly boundless affection for Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and the rest
of the cartoon gang.
   ``I think Disney owns the Florida vacation franchise and anyone
who thinks they can take that away is not going to be a happy
camper,'' says Jeffrey Logsdon, who follows the company for Crowell
Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.
   It's been suggested a recession could spoil the fun.
   Even a mild slowdown of the type many economists expect in coming
months inevitably would cut into people's spending on extras _ like
gasoline and the $94 four-day pass to the Florida complex _ says
Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York.
   Others doubt anything short of an economic disaster would
seriously dampen consumer enthusiasm for parks, movies and TV, both
live and recorded. After all, Hollywood's Golden Age was born during
the Great Depression.
   ``Unfortunately, the rougher it gets, the more people want to
have some exit from their environment,'' says CEO Eisner.
   Amid a wave of hostile takeover attempts at big media companies,
Disney recently tightened its defenses with a ``poison pill'' plan
that would allow present stockholders to buy new stock at half-price
if an unfriendly bid arose.
   But Disney already was considered relatively safe from raiders,
partly because of its experience with a hostile takeover attempt
five years ago. Analysts say it should remain that way as long as
the stock remains strong.
   Nearly 25 percent of the company's stock is owned by those
friendly to management, including 17 percent controlled by Texas
investor Sid Bass and allies, and nearly 3 percent in the hands of
Roy Disney, nephew of the late animator and company founder.
   A current civil trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court
reprises Disney's 1984 takeover battle, which resulted in ejection
of Walt Disney's son-in-law, Ronald Miller, from management and the
entry of Bass as a friendly investor. A shareholder lawsuit against
former management and directors alleges little investors were
wronged when the company bought raider Saul Steinberg's 11 percent
stake for a high price, a practice known as ``greenmail.''
   The Walt Disney Co. isn't a defendant.
   The company built on cartoon characters zealously defends Mickey
and the rest from impostors.
   Among its copyright actions this year: Dispatching lawyers
against three Hallandale, Fla., day-care centers that painted
pictures of Mickey and friends on their walls without permission;
blocking the city of White River, Ontario, from erecting a statue of
Winnie the Pooh; and wresting an apology for an unauthorized Snow
White song-and-dance number on the Academy Awards telecast.
