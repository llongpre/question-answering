   If fate had taken a different turn, Ron
Silver would now be teaching school or working for the State
Department instead of starring in a leading contender for Academy
Awards.
   In the much-acclaimed ``Enemies, a Love Story,'' the New York
actor plays Herman Broder, a concentration camp refugee who finds
himself with three wives: Margaret Sophie Stein, the peasant who
saved him from the Nazis; Lena Olin, his tempestuous lover; and
Anjelica Huston, who had been presumed killed in the war.
   Paul Mazursky based his film on the Isaac Bashevis Singer novel,
and it's being treated gently by 20th Century Fox. The release
pattern has been slow, the studio hoping that critical raves and
favorable word-of-mouth will attract audiences to such a special
kind of movie.
   Whether ``Enemies'' wins Oscars and box-office returns, Silver
believes the film is a victory for all concerned, proving a quality
film with literary elements can get made in Hollywood.
   Silver's roots are as deeply Jewish as Herman Broder's. His
maternal grandparents came from Poland to New York's Lower East
Side, where Silver grew up. Fascinated with foreign cultures, he
gained a bachelor's degree in Chinese and Spanish at the State
University of New York at Buffalo, and a master's at St. John's
University in New York and at the Taiwan College of Culture.
   ``I dwindled into acting,'' he remarked.
   First came high school teaching: ``I thought I was a good
teacher. I cared about what I was teaching. I wanted to reach the
kids, and I wanted to make it entertaining. I wanted them to see
what they were learning had application to their lives. I'm
disappointed that when I left the school, they all didn't stand on
their desks and say, `O, Captain, my Captain' (as in `Dead Poets
Society').''
   Silver quit to continue his travels abroad for his advanced
degree. In 1968-69 he studied in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Taiwan,
India and Hong Kong. He was caught in the middle of the
China-Soviet border conflict, crossed the Soviet Union on the
trans-Siberian railroad, and was arrested in Leningrad.
   ``When I got back, I decided not to complete my Ph.D. and not to
go into the government, which I was supposed to do,'' he said. ``I
drifted for a while, took acting classes, was a social worker. I
enjoyed the acting classes, and I received a lot of encouragement
from my early teachers. I was involved in academia for the longest
time, and this was kind of fun _ to go home with a blonde and
rehearse a scene.
   ``I got lucky right away, found an agent and started getting
jobs. I don't know how tenacious I would have been if I had to
stick it through. (Acting) was not a life-long passion with me.''
   Silver has led a busy career in films (``Garbo Talks,''
``Silkwood''), theater (``Hurlyburly,'' ``Speed the Plow'') and
television ``The Billionaire Boys Club,'' ``Wise Guy''). He admits
he was not Mazursky's first choice for ``Enemies, a Love Story.''
   ``Nor was I the second choice,'' he said with a laugh. ``It
makes sense, artistically and businesswise to go with somebody who
has a name. I don't know who was approached, but I can guess:
Dustin Hoffman and Richard Dreyfuss. For one reason or another, it
didn't work out.''
   He responded immediately to Mazursky's proposal, not only
because he believed in the material.
   ``Also it was a challenge for me,'' he said, ``because it was
different from roles I had been doing, which were fairly exuberant,
aggressive, articulate, expressive people. This guy was just the
opposite.''
   Silver sees one element favoring the movie's Oscar chances: ``It
always seems to happen with pictures that take a long time to get
made, where there is little compromising with the integrity of the
picture. `Rain Man' had a tough time being made (also `Platoon' and
`Ghandi'). It was a real labor of love for the director, and a lot
of studios turned it down.''
   ``Enemies'' was first developed by Mazursky at Touchstone
Pictures, which had a winner with his ``Down and Out in Beverly
Hills.'' The Disney people finally decided against proceeding, and
the film ended up with the independent Morgan Creek. Fox is the
releasing company.
   Silver admits he would love to see ``Enemies,'' and incidentally
himself, receive Academy honors. The reason for the allure of Oscar?
   ``This country likes winners. They treat winners very
specially,'' he said, laughing. ``The president refers to `the
winning team.' He doesn't talk about `the losing team.' He doesn't
say, `Hey, listen, you guys had a tremendous amount of character _
who cares who won?' This country is about winning.''
