ASSESSED BY THEIR COLLEAGUES.

Every year has its outstanding movie images, those visual moments that linger 
in the mind long after the credits have rolled. Somehow, Michelle Pfeiffer 
slithering on a grand piano in a clinging burgundy dress singing "Makin' 
Whoopie" to piano player Jeff Bridges in "The Fabulous Baker Boys" comes to 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene stood out for reasons other than the way Pfeiffer takes to 
burgundy. It was the way the camera, under the supervision of Oscar-nominated 
cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, captured her image, with a balance of shadow 
and light and a painterly use of colors that made the scene as playfully sultry 
as the song's lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
As veteran cinematographer William A. Fraker ("Heaven Can Wait") explains it, 
the film's cameraman "put the background lights on dimmers so that when the 
camera turns 360 degrees around the piano, he took the background out. Now, all 
of a sudden, (Pfeiffer) is the most important thing on the screen. You have 
only an illusion of people in the background." 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of artistry academy cinematographers say they look for when 
nominating works for Oscars -- images created through movement, lighting, 
composition and color that help a director tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
In this article, the first in a series spotlighting the nominees in the 
"technical" categories of the Academy Awards, we asked several directors of 
photography -- "DPs," as they're known in the trade -- to explain why the work 
of the five nominated cinematographers merited special praise. 
</P>
<P>
The nominees for best cinematographer in 1989 are Ballhaus, Freddie Francis 
("Glory"), Robert Richardson ("Born on the Fourth of July"), Mikael Salomon 
("The Abyss") and Haskell Wexler ("Blaze"). 
</P>
<P>
Opinions about the images of these films vary among their peers, depending on 
what their own interests are. Fraker, for instance, acknowledges that he is a 
"lighting man," meaning that he is more impressed by work done under artificial 
lighting than in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
John Alonzo ("Norma Rae") thinks lighting is over-emphasized and says there is 
a prejudice among motion-picture academy members against daylight 
cinematography. "That's why 'The Black Stallion' was overlooked several years 
ago," he says. "Well, God may have lit the horse for you, but you'd better know 
how to shoot him." 
</P>
<P>
The "prettiness" of images is what often brings moviegoers' attention to the 
camerawork. It also has that effect on fellow cinematographers, too, which 
explains the dominance of cinematographers of epic-scope movies in that Oscar 
category. Says Jan De Bont, who shot the current "The Hunt for Red October": 
"The hard part (of cinematography) is to light a scene in a dramatic way that 
supports the story. And that doesn't necessarily mean beautiful images." 
</P>
<P>
Vilmos Zsigmond ("The Deer Hunter") admits that "many times, a cinematographer 
makes things too pretty. You have to fight yourself not to." 
</P>
<P>
Cinematographers have different feelings about the style of camera use. Some 
say that with really good camerawork, you get so involved in the story, you 
aren't aware of the camera. Others say you should be aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
"In Fellini's '8 1/2' or Welles' 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' you are always 
aware of the camera," says De Bont. "To make the (camerawork) invisible, to me 
makes a movie bland." 
</P>
<P>
Zsigmond says the current slate of Oscar-nominated cinematographers reinforces 
his feeling that "the level of cinematography is higher than ever. There's more 
natural lighting. We have better cameras, lenses and film stock. 
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, the taste of audiences is improving. They are demanding more 
realism. The demand is there and so are the tools to do it. So there's no 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Here's how some of their colleagues assess the work of this year's Oscar 
nominees: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MIKAEL SALOMON 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss" 
</P>
<P>
The images achieved here involved a logistic nightmare. Salomon had to marry 
his underwater photography with a myriad of visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Underwater you lose contrast," Zsigmond points out. "So the ways Mikael 
Salomon found to make everything interesting is remarkable. I'm sure academy 
voters thought it was fantastic that (filming underwater) can be done with such 
a natural approach. In the audience, you feel you're there. Good cinematography 
brings the audience into the action." 
</P>
<P>
Fraker says Salomon's use of "exterior backlighting, putting things in 
silhouette, gave a creative visual mood to objects under water. Since you don't 
define that object, your imagination takes over. That involves an audience. It 
makes them work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HASKELL WEXLER 
</P>
<P>
"Blaze" 
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth nominations for Wexler, a past winner for both "Who's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf?" and "Bound for Glory." Yet, to the untutored eye, this 
nomination is the most puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
The naturalistically lighted historical drama can boast of neither spectacular 
scenery nor visual razzle-dazzle. Yet Wexler's work, which has already captured 
the American Society of Cinematographers' award for best feature photography, 
has fellow DPs dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad Hall ("Tequila Sunrise") notes that, "while the camera did not call 
attention to itself, there are sweet and gentle nuances. You go from room to 
room and each has a different color. The movement of the camera is exquisite 
and the compositions flawless." 
</P>
<P>
Fraker too cites the film's "changing visual look. That's what separates the 
men from the boys -- where you have 35 to 40 different sequences and moods in a 
picture, yet there's a consistency in the dramatic visual level. One scene is 
in bright sunlight and another a smoky nightclub, but the tonal levels are the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
Brianne Murphy marvels at the emotional content of the lighting. "The lighting 
tells you where you are and how the characters feel." 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo says that all cinematographers had to have been knocked out by the 
film's final shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It began as a waist shot of a figure, then pulls back to show the entire city. 
To do that you have to suspend a radio-controlled camera from the belly of a 
helicopter. Haskell designed the shot so he could change the (camera) aperture, 
iris and speed. As it pulled back to see the entire town, he had perfectly 
exposed frames. It's quite a piece of work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROBERT RICHARDSON 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the 4th of July" 
</P>
<P>
To work with the same director consistently, which occurred in the old studio 
days but is rare today, is a great advantage, and all the cinematographers 
interviewed for this story say this is Richardson and Stone's finest 
collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
"The camera told the (film's) story with its movements more than any other film 
this year," Zsigmond says. "You felt involved with the story. You were there." 
</P>
<P>
Says Hall: "I don't think I've seen a scene as nicely designed as the one where 
Ron Kovic is looking confused as (his unit) pulls out of that village. The 
village has been destroyed, there's noise everywhere, and wherever the camera 
looks it sees nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet its movements are so precise, you imagine what you're looking at. It makes 
panic understood visually. Then a very close presence appears, backlit so it's 
in silhouette. This makes it terribly understandable how Kovic made the mistake 
of shooting his own man." 
</P>
<P>
"Richardson is the most daring of all those nominated," says De Bont. "The film 
moves like crazy. The longest shot lasts only five or six seconds. You're 
taking part of the whole situation with the camera. You get inside the movie." 
</P>
<P>
De Bont also points to Richardson's stylistic elasticity, which in corporated 
the romanticism of Kovic's early childhood with shocking images in a 
rat-infested VA hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL BALLHAUS 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous Baker Boys" 
</P>
<P>
Ballhaus came out of the German New Wave to become a top American-based 
cameraman, shooting such pictures as "The Color of Money," "Working Girl" and 
"Broadcast News." In this film, his lighting and compositions caught the eyes 
of academy voters. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy says she was impressed with the way Ballhaus handled the light, the 
balance between the foreground and background. "You got the feeling of what was 
back there without it being lit." 
</P>
<P>
"Ballhaus is very good at creating moods with shadows and light," says 
Zsigmond. "As with Dutch paintings, the exciting part (of a scene) is what is 
not lit. The cinematographer tries to create a mood to bring audiences into 
that atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Fraker appreciates Ballhaus' lighting of his female star. "I'm a romanticist. 
If you take a movie star and put her on the screen, her face is 24 feet high. I 
don't want to see flaws. It's a matter of where you position your light." 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo, who recently filmed an ensemble cast of six actresses in "Steel 
Magnolias," could appreciate Ballhaus' handling of a film with multiple cast 
members, "how Ballhaus will use the camera to accentuate one individual in the 
frame, or two or three of them. Cinematography sometimes requires a delicate 
choreography." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FREDDIE FRANCIS 
</P>
<P>
"Glory" 
</P>
<P>
Many cinematographers admit their branch of the academy tends to nominate 
exterior pictures with a big scope over more intimate films such as "Enemies, a 
Love Story" or "Dead Poets Society." "Glory," the story of a black regiment in 
the Civil War, is such a picture. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like this film feel Francis' composition within the camera frame and 
the effectiveness of his lighting were the key factors in the British 
cinematographer's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Fraker calls Francis "a magnificent black-and-white man," recalling his early 
films, "Room at the Top" and "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning." 
</P>
<P>
"The images in 'Glory' remind me of a black-and-white film than any of the 
other (nominated films). He addressed himself to overcast skies and smoke and 
heavy backlighting and didn't use a lot of fill light for the battle scenes. He 
didn't have to show a bullet enter a body to create the effects of war. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what cinematography is all about -- creating an illusion."
