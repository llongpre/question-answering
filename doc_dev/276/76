   As a smashing finish to what has been the
movie industry's biggest year, the major studios are bringing forth
brightly wrapped packages to make the holiday season equally
prosperous.
   Among the offerings: Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr in a
devilish comedy; a remake of ``A Guy Named Joe'' from Steven
Spielberg; Denzel Washington in ``Glory,'' the story of the first
black regiment in U.S. history; Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell
in an action film; Tom Cruise as a disabled Vietnam veteran; Paul
Newman as a Louisiana governor entangled with a stripper; and Chevy
Chase on a Christmas vacation.
   Some may hit, some may miss. No matter what happens, the
business will be celebrating a record year on New Year's Eve.
   ``The box office will be $5 billion versus last year's record of
$4.46 billion,'' predicts Daily Variety's financial wizard A.D.
Murphy. ``Even more encouraging than ticket prices is the number of
admissions: 1.5 billion versus 1.08 billion last year. It's the
highest in five years.''
   While the number of tickets sold has held steady for 28 years at
around 1.1 billion, that is not a stagnant figure, Murphy said. Ten
years ago, theater rentals represented half of the studios'
receipts from feature films. This year, the income from theaters is
one-quarter of the lifetime receipts, the rest coming from such
markets as videocassettes, television network and syndication
sales, cable and pay TV.
   ``Much of the reason for the big box office this year comes from
the increase in screens,'' adds John Krier, president of Exhibitor
Relations, which monitors box-office figures. ``You can see the
difference in the number of new complexes that have opened in Los
Angeles and other cities. Many of them are large theaters.''
   As a sign of the times, Krier pointed out the record number of
films that have soared over the $100 million gross mark this year:
``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' ``Lethal Weapon
2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' and holdovers from late 1988 _
``Rain Man'' and ``Twins.''
   In addition, three films have sold more than $90 million worth
of tickets and may hit the magic mark: ``Dead Poets Society,''
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' and ``Parenthood.'' The October
release, ``Look Who's Talking,'' has made more than $85 million in
five weeks and seems certain to climb over $100 million.
   Despite negative reviews, Eddie Murphy's ``Harlem Nights'' has
the same potential.
   Here are some of the major enticements for the holiday moviegoer:
   _``Back to the Future Part II,'' more time travel with Michael
J. Fox and the mad professor Christopher Lloyd.
   _``The War of the Roses,'' a black comedy with Michael Douglas,
Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito, directed by DeVito.
   _``Glory,'' Edward Zwick directs Denzel Washington, Matthew
Broderick and Morgan Freeman in story of a young, white Civil War
colonel and his all-black regiment.
   _``Always,'' Steven Spielberg's venture into sentimental
romance, a remake of ``A Guy Named Joe'' with Richard Dreyfuss and
Holly Hunter.
   _``Valmont,'' Milos Forman's version of ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses,'' starring Colin Firth and Meg Tilly.
   _``We're No Angels,'' Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn in a remake of
the Humphrey Bogart-Aldo Ray comedy.
   _``Enemies, a Love Story,'' Paul Mazursky's look at a
relationship starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver.
   _``Handmaids Tale,'' the film version of Margaret Atwood's
celebrated novel, starring Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall.
   _``She Devil,'' with Meryl Streep as a romance novelist who
steals the husband of Roseanne Barr, who exacts a fiendish revenge.
   _``Henry V,'' Kenneth Branagh stars and directs in Shakespeare's
play about the embattled British king.
   _``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Tom Cruise as the disabled
veteran in a contemporary drama directed by Oliver Stone
(``Platoon'').
   _``Blaze,'' Paul Newman as Gov. Earl Long in a passionate affair
with a strip teaser (Louise Davidovich).
   _``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,'' Chevy Chase and
Randy Quaid in another gag-filled romp.
   _``Tango and Cash,'' Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell in a
fast-paced buddy picture.
   _``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman and Dan
Aykroyd in a movie version of the hit play.
   _``Family Business,'' a generational saga with Sean Connery,
Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick as bank robbers.
   Why do the studios send so many top attractions into the
marketplace at the end of the year? Partly it's in hopes that
Academy Award voters will be impressed.
   History _ especially last year's Oscars _ has proved that films
released late in the calendar year have a far greater chance of
Academy consideration.
   Murphy cites the commercial reason: ``Twelve percent of the
year's box office comes in the next six weeks. That's amazing
because it's really two hot periods, Thanksgiving and the Christmas
holidays, with a huge chasm in between. That's when people are
shopping and kids are still in school. Some pictures are unable to
bridge that chasm and they disappear.''
   The year-end results will be carefully watched by all the
studios as they calculate their share of the movie market. For the
year through Nov. 19, Murphy figures Warner Bros. ahead with 17.3
percent, thanks in large part to ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon
2.'' Columbia-Tri-Star follows with 15.9 percent, then comes
Universal at 15, Paramount at 14.6 and Buena Vista (Disney) at
14.2. Orion, Fox and MGM-UA languish in single digits.
   Warner Bros. seems likely to maintain its lead, as long as the
Chevy Chase and Stallone-Russell vehicles perform well. But if
``Back to the Future Part II'' breaks as big as Universal hopes,
the company could take over the lead.
   Since most of the other films are being released in middle to
late December, they probably won't affect the final tally.
