   In his first motion picture project for
Walt Disney Studios, Bill Murray will star in Touchstone Pictures'
``What About Bob?''
   The new comedy is written by Tom Schulman, who has been
nominated for an Academy Award for ``Dead Poets Society.''
   The movie is scheduled to begin production this summer.
   Murray plays Bob, an excessively neurotic man who resorts to
desperate measures when his psychiatrist takes off on an extended
family vacation.
   ``Bill is a gifted actor and Tom Schulman's script is
tailor-made for his unique comedic talents,'' said David Hoberman,
president of Touchstone Pictures.
   Murray recently made his directorial debut (with co-director
Howard Franklin) on the Warner Bros. caper comedy ``Quick Change,''
co-starring Geena Davis, Jason Robards and Randy Quaid. ``Quick
Change'' is to be released this summer.
