<LEADPARA>  EXPECT more date-juggling and cancellations in the weeks ahead as distributors
size up the competition. But at this juncture, your best bets would seem:;  
(check) "Love Crimes" (Miramax, mid-September). Sean Young, once billed as a
player in a "real-life 'Fatal Attraction' case," plays a tough prosecuting
attorney who discovers she likes it rough as she's drawn under the spell of a
serial rapist. Feminists should have a field day with this one.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) "Deceived" (Touchstone, Sept. 27). Goldie Hawn in one of her two
fall movies (the other is "Alone Together") plays an art restorer who
discovers some very unsettling truths about her late husband. With John
Heard.;   (check) "The Fisher King" (Tri-Star, Sept. 27). A cockeyed urban
odyssey by Terry ("Brazil") Gilliam. Jeff Bridges plays a New York "shock
jock" who falls in with Robin Williams' erudite street crazy. Together, they
make like King Arthur on his quest for the Holy Grail.;   (check) "Stepping
Out" (Paramount, Oct. 4). Real life and reel life merge in fascinating ways in
this mix of "A Chorus Line" and "Rocky." Liza Minnelli, who hasn't had a
decent screen vehicle since "Cabaret," attempts a comeback as a Buffalo, N.Y.,
dance teacher who learns new self-worth while putting a handful of amateurs
through their paces for a local charity event. Directed by Lewis ("Alfie")
Gilbert.;   (check) "Frankie &amp; Johnny" (Paramount, Oct. 11). Al Pacino as a
short-order cook? Michelle Pfeiffer as a mouthy waitress in a New York City
diner? Garry ("Pretty Woman") Marshall is the director-producer and Terrence
McNally the writer.;   (check) "K-2" (Miramax, mid-October). Michael Biehn and
Matt Crave co-star as temperamentally opposite climbers who have time to
reflect on past sins, mistakes, etc., as they cling for life on the side of a
mountain. Directed by Franc ("Lords of Discipline") Roddam.;   (check) "Love
Field" (Orion, Oct. 18). An interracial romance set in the Kennedy '60s. It
co-stars Pfeiffer and Dennis Haysbert, and is being directed by the
always-interesting Jonathan ("Heart Like a Wheel") Kaplan.;   (check) "The
Butcher's Wife" (Paramount, Oct. 25). A quirky comedy-romance about a New York
butcher who, while on a fishing trip, meets and weds a clairvoyant named
Marina. Demi Moore, Jeff Daniels and Mary Steenburgen co-star.;   (check)
"Grand Canyon" (20th Century-Fox, October). Lawrence Kasdan, the man behind
"Body Heat" and "The Big Chill," returns with another "deadly serious"
ensemble piece with everyone asking, "What's it all about?" Danny Glover,
Steve Martin, Kevin Kline and Mary McDonnell of "Dances with Wolves" co-star.;
  (check) "Hard Promises" (Columbia, Nov. 1). The too-little-seen Sissy Spacek
returns in this adult comedy that sounds more than a little like "The
Philadelphia Story" or one of those old Doris Day romps. William Petersen
("Manhunter," "Cousins") co-stars as the missing husband who returns on the
eve of his ex-wife's nuptials.;   (check) "Bugsy" (MGM at Thanksgiving).
Warren Beatty forever buried his pretty-boy image when, in 1967, he played
folk hero Clyde Barrow and helped oversee the watershed "Bonnie and Clyde."
Here, he's a flashier, if not deadlier, mobster "driven by love" to create a
gambling mecca in the Nevada desert. The estimable Barry ("Rain Man") Levinson
is in the director's chair.;   (check) "The Addams Family" (Paramount, Nov.
22). Cartoonist Charles Addams' macabre eccentrics return in this "darkly
humorous" satire starring Anjelica Huston as Morticia, Raul Julia as Gomez and
Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester. Trouble-plagued from the start (first-time
director Barry Sonnenfeld was hospitalized during production), this stylized
mix of high camp, romance and horror is seeking the same crowd that flocked to
"Beetlejuice.";   (check) "Cape Fear" (Universal, November). Martin Scorsese,
a longtime fan of classic film noir, finally gets to try his hand at updating
one of the best: J. Lee Thompson's 1962 thriller about an attorney and his
family who are terrorized by a former client just released from the slammer.
Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro have the roles formerly played by Gregory Peck
and Robert Mitchum, who can be glimpsed in cameos here.;   (check) "An
American Tail: Fievel Goes West" (Universal, November). Sequel to one of the
most successful animated features of all time reunites much of the original's
technical and acting talent. Immigrant Fievel pursues his dream of becoming a
rodent Wyatt Earp in this installment. With the voice talents of John Cleese,
Dom DeLuise, Amy Irving, Jon Lovitz and James Stewart. A Steven Spielberg
production.;   (check) "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe"
(Universal, December). Consecutive best-actress Oscar winners Jessica Tandy
and Kathy Bates appear in this adaptation of the Fannie Flagg novel about
friendship and murder in rural Alabama.;   (check) "Star Trek VI: The
Undiscovered Country" (Paramount, Dec. 13). In what is being called the swan
song of the original "Star Trek" gang, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, et al.
pour on the coal and warp-speed their way into Klingon territory. After the
disappointment of the last installment (overseen by Shatner), the series'
creator is promising a return to nuts-and-bolts adventure.;   (check)
"Medicine Man" (originally titled "The Last Days of Eden," Touchstone,
Christmas). This sounds like the adventure-romance to beat this winter. Sean
Connery plays an irascible research scientist in the Brazilian rain forests.
His personal Eden is threatened by the arrival of a pharmaceutical-lab snoop
(Lorraine Bracco) and greedy developers. Written by Tom ("Dead Poets Society")
Schulman and directed by John McTiernan ("Die Hard," "The Hunt for Red
October").;   (check) "For the Boys" (20th Century-Fox, Christmas). Bette
Midler and James Caan sing and dance their way from Pearl Harbor to Vietnam in
what is being billed as "a bittersweet musical comedy." Mark ("On Golden
Pond") Rydell directs.;   (check) "Hook" (Tri-Star, Christmas). Spielberg
shelved his traditional remake of the perennial children's story and came up
with a sequel of sorts. This one takes place 80 years later, with a grown
Peter Pan (Williams again) winging to the aid of "Gran" Wendy. Dustin Hoffman
is on board as Captain Hook; Bob Hoskins plays First Mate Smee; and Julia
Roberts flits from cliff-hanger to cliff-hanger as that jealous sprite Tink.
Longtime Spielberg collaborator John Williams is composing the score.;  
(check) "Basic Instinct" (Tri-Star, Christmas). Another high-concept thriller
from writer Joe ("Jagged Edge") Eszterhas, who is here teamed with
splatter-artist supreme Paul ("Total Recall") Verhoeven. Described as an
"erotic thriller," this San Francisco-set mystery has been tagged
"homophobic." Michael Douglas plays a homicide detective faced with a serial
killer or killers.;   (check) "Prince of Tides" (Columbia, Christmas).
Producer-director-star-songwriter Barbra Streisand's adaptation of the complex
Pat Conroy novel about a New York psychiatrist (Streisand) and a sidelined
football coach (Nolte) from a dysfunctional South Carolina family. The word
from preview screenings has been good; so expect Streisand and Nolte to cop
Oscar nods. If this comes to pass -- and Streisand is recognized for her
directing by the Academy -- it will be a first for an American woman.  </TEXT>
