<LEADPARA>  ROBIN WILLIAMS; (box) He won't grow up, he'll just lose weight; Lately, he's
tempered his manic image with restrained performances in films such as Dead
Poets Society and Awakenings. Which has led some people to wonder which is the
real Robin Williams. Maybe Williams wonders that himself. As he told Rolling
Stone, his wife "gets asked that all the time: 'He must be really wild at
home!' The truth is that if I were, she wouldn't be alive. That type of
freneticism is insane." Williams will next be seen in The Fisher King and at
Christmastime in Steven Spielberg's Hook, in which as almost everyone knows,
he plays a grown-up Peter Pan. "Let's just say the tights are full," he
comments about the role. "I have to drop 25 pounds. People's image of Peter
Pan is not, you know, Porky Pan."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   KATEY SAGAL; (box) That trash is nothing but flash; She's not a tramp, she
just plays one on TV, the ineffable Peg Bundy of Married . . . With Children.
Of course, it helps that she was once in Bette Midler's backup group, the
Harlettes, and that may have gone into the creation of Peg. "I did go through
a rock 'n' roll -- I mean serious, you know, leather/spandex rock 'n' roll
period," Sagal told Interview. "So I think that she comes from a little bit of
that. I had my hair red with black streaks, like a raccoon, sort of. I had
that for a while. I used to have this boyfriend who . . . the cool thing about
him was that he would do this big pompadour thing with my hair and we would go
out. And I had this convertible car at the time, and we'd spray it with --
what's that hairspray? There's one hairspray that's the best extra-super-hold
something. I don't know, it works really good . . . and our hair wouldn't move
in the convertible, so that's a little bit Peg Bundyish -- you know, she's got
that trash appeal.";  ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.; (box) Notes from the underground;
Downey's parents were experimental filmmakers. "When your mom's making
underground films," he told Movieline, "four out of five dentists surveyed say
she doesn't put on the shawl and drive you to work every morning: 'I'm sorry,
your father and I have to go to Florida to shoot a beach sequence that just
came to his mind.' " But his haphazard upbringing may have made Downey one of
young Hollywood's more eccentric if endearing personalities. "A lot of my peer
group think I'm an eccentric bisexual, like I may even have an ammonia-filled
tentacle or something somewhere on my body. That's OK. Being relaxed about
sexuality is something you're born with. It's just part of your personality
before you show up.";  PATTI DAVIS; (box) Here's to the lady who "lunched"; It
was inevitable that Vanity Fair should ask Nancy Reagan's daughter about That
Book. "Someone once said my father's like Teflon," Davis replied. "Well, my
mother's like flypaper. But there's such a contradiction between her image and
reality that it confuses people. Then along comes this 600-page Kitty Kelley
book full of all this bad stuff and you're supposed to believe that one little
woman who weighs about 15 pounds is running the country. People don't have a
well-rounded portrait." As for her mother's celebrated "lunches" with Frank
Sinatra, Davis has reasons to be skeptical. "They had him escort me to some
governor's inaugural thing when my father first got elected. When I read about
my mother and Sinatra in Kitty's book I thought, 'Well, God, I spent this
whole evening with him and he never came on to me.' Of course, I was jailbait
at the time, but he was very gentlemanly. We talked about music; he was going
to teach me to sing. And then I thought, 'Maybe he did come on to me, and I
just didn't recognize it.' Maybe there was something to those singing lessons
after all."  </TEXT>
