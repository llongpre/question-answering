In the village where I grew up, there were movies to be seen in the summertime, 
but there were no summer movies in the modern sense. Hammondsport, N.Y., was so 
far down in the releasing pattern that even a movie released in early summer 
would have been unlikely to get to the Park Theater before late autumn at the 
earliest, and, more likely, it would have been winter, spring or, entirely 
coincidentally, the following summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Park was what distributors call a subsequent-run house, and we were such a 
subsequent run that by the time the prints got to us they would be jumpy with 
splices, the last frames of every reel a snowstorm of scratches where the tails 
had been allowed to flap during changeovers. The splices would fail and the 
screen would go white, and then black, amid terrible groans from the audience 
and roars of rage from the projection booth. 
</P>
<P>
After a delay, the picture would resume, somewhat further on into the story. I 
hardly remember a movie that went from start to finish without a break. 
</P>
<P>
But they were movies, and that was all that mattered. And the movies were then, 
far more than they are in the age of television and automobiles (scarce in 
Depression days), a window on other worlds, other lifestyles. Big cities, not 
less than the Wild West, were illuminated for us at the Park. The window may 
have been rose-tinted and full of distortions, but it offered a thrilling 
glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
If we didn't get summer movies as such, promptly, the movies of summer 
nevertheless had a very particular excitement. Presuming you had a sufficiency 
of dimes (that being all too briefly the price of the pre-adult ticket), you 
could go any night of the week, there being no school the next day. Otherwise 
it was Friday or Saturday night only. (The Park had no matinees.) 
</P>
<P>
The bill changed three times a week. Friday and Saturday we almost invariably 
had a Western, a newsreel, a cartoon or a live-action comedy short and a 
serial, which was itself often a Western. With luck, the feature and the serial 
would both star my favorite, Charles (Buck) Jones. I even remember a Buck Jones 
double feature plus a Buck Jones serial, a sort of one-night festival. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday most often gave us a musical or a comedy. When those 
legendary madcap comedies came along, they opened Sunday (two shows, 7 and 9). 
The prime reward of school-less summer movie-going was the chance to see those 
Sunday features, because they included such treasures as the Fred Astaire 
musicals, the Dick Powell-Ruby Keeler musicals and the W. C. Fields comedies 
and other items that have stood the test of time for their nostalgic appeal but 
also for their creativity and their craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Midweek -- Wednesday and Thursday -- were given over to drama and melodrama. It 
was the least appealing change of program to the young viewers, of whom I was 
one. They were apt to star the likes of Warner Baxter, George Brent, Kay 
Francis and Bette Davis, and a high proportion of them seemed to come from 
Warner Bros. Many of them were about romance, a low-appeal screen subject in 
grade school, material dismissed as intolerably mushy, what with people 
misunderstanding each other or being separated for one reason or another but 
eventually getting back together again, usually outdoors at sunset or on the 
terrace of a penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, I wish I had been precocious enough to want to spend more summer 
nights seeing those midweek attractions. I can catch up with them now, of 
course, at 3 in the morning, generally interrupted by commercials for all the 
ingenious things you can buy by calling an 800 number. 
</P>
<P>
The summer movie as a kind of sub-genre within the movies has come into its own 
in more recent times. In earlier years, there was never a time that wasn't 
right for action pictures, raucous comedies and horror flicks calculated to 
make you shiver on the hottest summer nights. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the monopoly of mindless fun within the summer-release schedule has 
never been total. Just as you couldn't really detect any significant 
differences between summer and winter programming in Hammondsport (Buck Jones 
was a man for all seasons), so there are always surprises within the summer 
fare now. 
</P>
<P>
My memories of summer movie-going do not end at the Park Theater and its 
non-upholstered and stern-testing seats. With a little prompting from the 
files, I've been remembering some of the later films that I first watched when 
they came out in the good old summertime. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's summer success, "Dead Poets Society," caught the industry by 
surprise. It was thought to be anything but escapist stuff. It was a dark 
drama, although with comedic overtones, and it involved the suicide of a 
sympathetic figure. It was also about school, of which the young target 
audience had presumably had enough by then. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on the up side, the story was enormously sympathetic to the young (and a 
good deal less so to their elders, represented by a nasty headmaster and an 
obsessive father). And the film had a big lure in Robin Williams as its star. 
Not least, it was, by the standards of any month, a superior film. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the triumphant release, and of the film itself, was never 
underestimate the young. The wider moral is, or ought to be, don't sell summer 
audiences short at all. They are ready for more than distributors and 
exhibitors sometimes give them credit for. 
</P>
<P>
You'd have said that certain high-quality films were inevitable summer fare. 
You can't imagine that matchless ode to youth and summer, "American Graffiti" 
(July, 1973), for example, appearing at any other time. Nor "Roger Rabbit" 
(June, 1988) nor the Beatles and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (July, 
1978) nor "Alien" (May, 1979) or "Aliens" (July, 1986). 
</P>
<P>
"Stand By Me," Rob Reiner's warm and dramatic tale of four boys on a purposeful 
summer hike, was well-placed in August, 1986, and so was a slick thriller, 
"Stakeout" (August, 1987), with its strong doses of comedy and romance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there have been other summer releases that were less predictable in terms 
of conventional wisdom, and with varying consequences. I suspect that 
"Chinatown" (July, 1974) would have been a success at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Allen's "Zelig," released in July, 1983, was not a box-office smash, but 
it is a fair guess that his technically ingenious film did at least as well in 
summer release as it would have in another season, and perhaps better. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Coppola's "Tucker" was released in August, 1988, perhaps on the 
reasonable ground that summer is high season for automobiles, and what better 
time to celebrate a Detroit-defying car maker? But despite Coppola's name and 
some enthusiastic reviews, the film fared poorly. Would it have done better in 
late fall or mid-winter? The question, as they say, is moot. 
</P>
<P>
"Carnal Knowledge" came out in July, 1971, and while sexiness is a desirable 
criterion for summer fare, that film's view was many shades darker and more 
cynical than the norm. But it found audiences. Yet "Portnoy's Complaint," 
another summer release (July, 1972) with a comparably dark view of 
relationships, disappointed commercially. 
</P>
<P>
"A World Apart," with Barbara Hershey's excellent performance as a courageous 
white South African journalist imprisoned for her views, opened in June, 1988, 
and despite fine reviews did not find audiences. Would it have been more 
successfully placed somewhere between Labor Day and Easter? The answer is 
unknowable. 
</P>
<P>
The marketing of movies has struck me as an art struggling to become a science, 
hoping to supplant hunches and experience with preview samplings and exit 
polls. My hunch is that the idea of what makes a summer release is under 
review, following the evidence of "Dead Poets Society" that a summer picture 
not less than a winter picture can engage the mind and the heart. 
</P>
<P>
My corollary hunch, which began to form years ago on the Park Theater's 
splintery seats, is that a good picture will find audiences in any season. It's 
probably true that in Upstate New York the appeal of escapist fare was stronger 
in winter than in summer. But the real joy of summer movies was that you didn't 
have to walk home in the snow.
