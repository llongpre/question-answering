   West Germany approved $3.6 billion in
aid for East Germany on Wednesday to keep its economy afloat and
prevent its citizens from fleeing in frustration until the two
nations become one.
   Another $1 billion was approved to resettle East Germans who
come to the West. Though the money is earmarked for specific East
German programs, none of it will go directly to the government of
Communist Premier Hans Modrow, who likely will be ousted when the
country holds its first free elections March 18.
   Modrow, whose two-day summit here concluded Wednesday, had
requested $9 billion in immediate direct aid Tuesday but was turned
down by the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Wednesday
for legislative backing for a stronger presidency and said it was
vital to his reforms, but wary lawmakers refused to be stampeded
into setting a timetable.
   Once again, the 542-member Supreme Soviet proved itself a force
to be reckoned with in the new Soviet political game, which under
Gorbachev has shifted more from closed-door sessions of the Kremlin
leadership to elected government bodies.
   After a two-month break, the fledgling Soviet legislature
reconvened for the third time in its less than one-year history.
Lawmakers approved a 22-item agenda to debate bills designed to put
flesh on the skeleton of Gorbachev's economic and social reforms,
including legalization of private property.

   The African National Congress
insists on full black voting rights, but it is open to compromise
on other constitutional issues and to considering guarantees for
whites, Nelson Mandela said Wednesday.
   Mandela, who plans to consult soon with ANC leaders in Zambia,
did not elaborate on what compromises might be reached.
   ``I think it be most presumptuous of me to speak for the ANC,''
he said. ``It is the ANC who would decide what compromises it
should make. ... We are ready for honorable compromises without
surrendering our principles.''
   During a conversation with a small group of reporters, Mandela
was asked whether the ANC was willing to negotiate about its demand
for a one-person, one-vote system, which would lead to black
majority rule.

   President Bush will refuse to meet with
Peruvian coca growers at the Colombian drug summit and will travel
to Cartagena with a sharply reduced staff because of concerns for
his safety, White House officials said Wednesday.
   On the eve of the one-day meeting of four hemispheric nations,
the White House also retreated from previous suggestions that Bush
would revive a proposal to send U.S. Navy warships into South
American waters to track cocaine-trafficking planes.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater denounced the
kidnapping of two American citizens in Colombia on Tuesday by
leftist guerrillas who said they were protesting Bush's impending
visit.

   The bittersweet ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' carried off a leading nine Academy Award nominations
Wednesday as Oscar voters passed over box-office blockbusters and
maverick movies with equal abandon.
   ``Daisy,'' which traces the relationship over the decades
between a testy Jewish widow and her tolerant black chauffeur in
the South, drew nominations for best picture and actors Morgan
Freeman, Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's account
of Ron Kovic's painful passage from blind patriotism to unselfish
protest by way of a Vietnam injury that left him a paraplegic, got
eight nominations, including best picture. Also nominated in the
top picture category by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences were ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Field of Dreams'' and ``My
Left Foot.''

   An Indian Airlines Airbus jet that had
been in use only three months crashed onto a golf course and burned
Wednesday short of a runway in southern India, and 91 of the 146
people on board died, officials said.
   The Airbus-320 grazed a clump of trees on its final approach to
Bangalore airport and caught fire when it hit the ground, about 50
yards from the runway, officials said.
   The flight originated in Bombay, 530 miles northwest of
Bangalore. The officials said 139 passengers and a crew of seven
were on the hour-long flight and at least 55 people survived the
crash, including two Americans, the airline said.
