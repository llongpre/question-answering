   Lights! Camera! Action-adventure! That seems
to be the movie ticket for the winter and spring as the film
industry moves into 1990 with hopes of another record-breaking year.
   Comedy is king this summer, and drama plays a strong role in the
Oscar-conscious fall and holiday season. The first five months of
the year (Memorial Day is the official opening of the summer
season) brings a host of action-adventure from the major studios.
   There will be cop movies galore, and the streets of Los Angeles
will again be littered with cars demolished in high-speed chases.
Among this season's officers: Jamie Lee Curtis, Brian Dennehy,
Steven Seagal, Tom Berenger, Lou Diamond Phillips, Gene Hackman and
Dan Aykroyd.
   ``White Hunter, Black Heart'' is also likely to draw attention.
It is based on Peter Viertel's novel about an adventurous film
director (obviously John Huston) on location in Africa. It's an
offbeat role for Clint Eastwood, who also directed.
   The most eagerly awaited adventure is ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' the first of Tom Clancy's novels to be filmed. Sean
Connery stars as the Russian sub commander and Alec Baldwin is the
CIA analyst probing why the sub is approaching the eastern U.S.
seaboard.
   The police sagas include: ``Loose Cannons,'' Hackman as a
hard-boiled cop and Aykroyd as his partner, who switches
personalities under stress; ``Hard to Kill,'' Steve Seagal as a
detective who seeks revenge after seven years in a coma; ``The Last
of the Finest,'' Brian Dennehy as a suspended cop who uncovers drug
millions; ``Love at Large,'' Tom Berenger and Elizabeth Perkins as
two detectives who fall in love; ``The First Power,'' Lou Diamond
Phillips in pursuit of a serial killer; and ``Blue Steel'' with
Jamie Lee Curtis also in pursuit of a serial killer.
   Adventure of a more exotic sort will be offered with ``Mountains
of the Moon,'' about the search for the origins of the Nile by two
19th-century explorers.
   Want to be scared? Paramount Pictures is presenting ``Tales From
the Darkside: The Movie,'' with stories by Stephen King, Arthur
Canon Doyle and others. ``Roger Corman's Frankenstein Unbound''
marks Corman's first direction in 20 years. William Friedkin (``The
Exorcist'') returns to horror with ``The Guardian.''
   Robert De Niro is back in the Mafia scene in ``Good Fellas.''
Arnold Schwarznegger finds action in the year 2075 in ``Total
Recall,'' directed by Paul Verhoeven (``Robocop'').
   Among the comedies, ``I Love You to Death'' holds promise with
stars Kevin Kline, Tracey Ullman, William Hurt and River Phoenix.
The latest ``Saturday Night Live'' comic to join the movies is Dana
Carvey, the Church Lady, who plays his own gender in ``Opportunity
Knocks.'' SNL alumnus Bill Murray co-directs himself and Geena
Davis in ``Quick Change.''
   Marlon Brando resumes with the Mafia in ``The Freshman,'' as a
mobster who befriends student Matthew Broderick. Dudley Moore stars
with Daryl Hannah in ``Crazy People,'' a comedy about the ad world.
There is Southern Gothic humor in ``Daddy's Dyin' (Who's Got the
Will?)'' with Tess Harper, Beverly D`Angelo and Beau Bridges. Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan star in a romantic comedy with the unlikely
title of ``Joe Versus the Volcano.''
   Two added attractions are ``Ernest Goes to Jail'' and ``The Gods
Must Be Crazy II.''
   The long-delayed ``The Two Jakes'' will certainly draw attention
among the dramas. It's Jack Nicholson's followup to ``Chinatown,''
also starring Harvey Keitel and Meg Tilly.
   Bette Midler revives the old Barbara Stanwyck tearjerker
``Stella Dallas'' in ``Stella.'' Hot star Kevin Costner courts
trouble in ``Revenge'' when he falls in love with the wife of a
powerful Mexican (Anthony Quinn). In ``Texasville,'' Peter
Bogdonavich traces the later history of ``The Last Picture Show''
people.
   Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro fall in love when she teaches him
to read in ``Stanley and Iris.'' Jessica Lange learns to cope with
widowhood in the big city in ``Men Don't Leave.'' Nick Nolte and
Debra Winger get involved in murder and corruption in ``Everybody
Wins.''
   More drama: Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in ``Pretty Woman'';
Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney in ``Miller's Crossing''; a young
cast in a new version of ``Lord of the Flies.''
   The season seems to offer films for every taste; there's even a
movie about volleyball, ``Side Out.'' Except for ``The Hunt for Red
October'' and ``The Two Jakes,'' none of the films seems to have
the smell of a sure winner. But then, neither did ``Dead Poets
Society,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Look Who's Talking,''
the unlikely hits of 1989.
