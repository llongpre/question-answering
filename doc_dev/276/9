   ``Dead Poets Society'' (Touchstone. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG)
   
   ``Dead Poets Society'' was a surprise theatrical hit last year,
winning Academy Award nominations for best picture, actor (Robin
Williams) and Tom Schulman's original screenplay.
   Williams gives a tour de force performance as John Keating, a
highly unorthodox and inspiring English teacher at an affluent New
England prep school in the 1950s. He encourages his students to
take risks and to believe in themselves and all possibilities.
   The real stars are the boys themselves, who revive a secret
literary society, on which the movie hinges.
   This is a fulfilling video, one that will inspire the entire
family.
   Another recent student-teacher video on the market is MGM's
``The Blackboard Jungle.'' This 1955 black and white movie stars
Glenn Ford as a teacher in an inner city school filled with punks
and thugs. A young Sidney Poitier plays a student.
   Here's a brief list of other noteworthy student-teacher videos:
   _``Goodbye, Mr. Chips'' (1939): Robert Donat gives an
Oscar-winning and heartwarming performance as the Latin teacher
Chips. Greer Garson is his wife.
   _``Cheers for Miss Bishop'' (1941): A warm and touching story in
the tradition of ``Goodbye, Mr. Chips.'' The movie Stars Martha
Scott as a Midwestern schoolteacher who devotes her entire life to
teaching.
   _``The Corn Is Green'' (1945): Bette Davis stars as a school
teacher who tries to help a young miner win a scholarship.
   _``Tom Brown's Schooldays'' (1950): Life at a boys school during
Victorian England. Robert Newton is wonderful. Cedric Hardwicke and
Freddie Bartholomew star in an earlier version (1940) titled ``Tom
Brown's School Days.'' Limp compared to 1950 film, and filled with
Hollywood cliches.
   _``Up the Down Staircase'' (1967): Sandy Dennis as a ditsy
teacher in a New York City high school.
   _``To Sir With Love'' (1967): Sidney Poitier woos and wins over
a bunch of trashy punks in London's East End.
   _``Children of a Lesser God'' (1986): An Academy Award-winning
performance by Marlee Matlin as a deaf woman who falls in love with
her teacher.
   _``Stand and Deliver'' (1988): Edward James Olmos was nominated
for an Oscar for his portrayal of Jaime Escalante, who led his
inner city math students to victory with the Advanced Placement
test in calculus.
   _``The Chocolate War'' (1989): A student takes on a secret
society at his Roman Catholic high school and his sadistic teacher.
