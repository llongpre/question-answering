   Robin Williams traverses the country, ridiculing
Republicans. Ronald Reagan is ``the world's largest Muppet.'' Dan
Quayle is ``the Stepford candidate.'' George Bush is a political
hypnotist: ``T'ousand points of light, watch de watch.''
   People laugh. They reward Williams with ovations. And they elect
Bush.
   ``I don't know, I can't understand it,'' Williams said, in a
recent interview. ``Bush still got elected. ... It was like, `What?
Wait a minute, why?' I kept doing joke after joke, firing. Quayle is
too easy. I mean, it's like shooting bullets into a dead horse.''
   He intends to keep on firing _ at such targets as the Supreme
Court (``some of what you see is trying to write the Constitution on
an Etch-A-Sketch'') and the imperial presidency (there is an effort
to ``turn Congress into this kind of benign boys club. They pass a
law, and it's like ... `What laws? We don't need no stinkin'
laws.''')
   The jokes keep coming, but there is an underlying seriousness to
Robin Williams' wacky world. One measure is the political material
that has been incorporated in his act in recent years; another is
the charity benefits in which he participates.
   This March he will appear on the third-annual HBO ``Comic
Relief'' to raise money for the homeless; on Feb. 6, he will appear
at a New York benefit to raise money for housing and for medical
vans to treat homeless children, a project sponsored by singer Paul
Simon. Tables for the show at the Sheraton Centre sell from $10,000
to $25,000. That kind of ticket puts a lot of pressure on a
performer.
   ``You know the chicken's not what they're paying for,'' he said.
   Williams, 38, is coming off his biggest screen success, ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' in which he portrayed an irreverent Saigon
deejay. He's just completed work on a new film, ``The Dead Poets
Society,'' about a teacher at a private boys school in the 1950s.
   But it was Williams' artistry as a stand-up comic that launched
his career and made him an enormous success.
   He's much in demand on the benefit circuit. His main charities
involve AIDS and the homeless, and he finds himself turning down
worthy causes.
   ``The problem is you don't want to end up being like someone who
would go to the opening of an envelope,'' he said.
   ``You diminish your power; you also diminish your ability to help
the cause if you start doing every cause. Then people go, `Oh, it's
him.' There was a time when I did do every benefit. `Save the
Shrimp' _ he's there! `People, people, listen _ cocktail sauce is a
horrible fate, people!'''
   He tries to find out as much as he can about his causes and
candidates. ``You better know about it, or you'll get creamed.
They'll start asking, `Do you know his stand on the basic budget
deficit?'''
   In a child's voice: ``No. He's a nice guy though. Drives a good
car.''
   He picks his causes from ``gut feeling'' and experience. He has
watched as acquired immune deficiency syndrome struck his friends, a
generation of performing artists. ``It was everybody _
choreographers, designers, everything, gone,'' he said.
   He is proud of a ``Saturday Night Live'' bit he did on condoms.
   ``I was trying to reach people other than people who know about
them, trying to reach 14 year olds: `It's a balloon. I know, it's
difficult. (blowing sound) Use it. Inflate it. Put it on. It's a
bathing cap of love. Don't be afraid.' `Uh, well, I'll lose my
sensitivity.' `Yeah, you're real sensitive. SLAP! Wake up! Wise up,
Sparkie!'''
   Homelessness, too, is an issue he has observed personally. Most
recently, while in New York to perform in Lincoln Center's
production of ``Waiting for Godot,'' he was stopped by panhandlers
each night on the way to the theater.
   ``New York looks like Bombay,'' he said. ``People are stepping
over other people. Two people froze to death last night. You go to
Grand Central Station and people are stacked like cord wood. People
are stepping over them, and there's (Mayor Edward) Koch, kind of
like Mayor (Elmer) Fudd, saying, `I feel like de pwabwem will go
away uhhhhhh.''
   He is shaken by the city shelters. ``For me, the most horrifying
thing is that there are children. You can't not be moved when you
see a child in these shelters, when they're living in these big,
open dorms,'' he said.
   Children play an important role in Williams' thinking. He traces
his involvement in causes to the birth of his son, Zachary, nearly
six years ago. Fatherhood, he says, ``connects you immediately with
everything.''
   ``I want the world to be at least slightly better for him, to
make it a little bit better so that he will not have to live
underground with a two-headed dog,'' Williams said.
   He uses comedy, he said, ``to lash out, to cut through things _
to cut through the illusion of things, that everything is all
right.''
   This is not always well received. Some audiences balk at
political humor, and ``they'll look like a deer in the headlights of
a Peterbilt (a tractor-trailer).''
   Williams says there are few things that do not lend themselves to
comedy.
   ``Part of being a comic is that you're forced to laugh at
everything,'' he says. ``It makes it difficult to live with one. ...
There is dark humor, too. And everybody has that dark humor, even
about the darkest and bleakest things.''
   He tries to avoid cruelty _ a line he admits to having crossed
more than once. He describes a ``bad comic-good comic'' battle
within.
   ``That's cruel, that's unnecessarily cruel,'' the good comic says.
   ``Yeah, but it's funny. Yeah, it's cruel, but it's REAL funny,''
says the bad comic.
   ``It's cruel.''
   ``Yeah, but ya gotta laugh. Go with it. Don't be afraid!''
   ``No, no, no.''
   ``Oh, shut up.''
   Then, says Robin Williams, the middle mind says: ``Yeah, it's
funny.''
