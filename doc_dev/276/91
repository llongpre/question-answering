   His career encompassed film classics from ``Oh,
Mr. Bankrobber'' to ``Rebel Without A Tie.''
   With Noel Coward, he adapted ``Hamlet'' - ``Very nice,
Denmark,'' went the dialogue. He sang ``You've Got To Heat the
Pot'' in the rollicking 1960s musical, ``Keep Your Hair On
Daddio.''
   Sir Norbert Smith is perhaps the most illustrious British actor
who never existed. Fans of British comedy at its nuttiest will love
the tribute, ``Sir Norbert Smith: A Life,'' broadcast Friday on
public television's ``Great Performances.''
   ``It's an affectionate send-up,'' says 29-year-old Harry
Enfield, who dons a flowing white beard and genially bled
manner to play the distinguished octogenarian.
   The script by Enfield and Geoffrey Perkins traces Sir Norbert's
life from childhood - ``his father was a man, his mother a woman,''
we are told - through excerpts from films such as the gentle
``Rover Returns Home'' and the angry ``Carry On Banging,'' about
nuclear disarmament.
   No movie genre escapes unscathed, from the dopiest of film
biographies to Britain's grim working-class films of the 1960s.
   Will Americans find it funny?
   ``It depends on how many British films they've seen,'' Enfield
said in an interview.
   Sir Norbert is seen being questioned by Melvyn Bragg, the
television personality who conducted a celebrated interview with
Laurence Olivier in 1985.
   But Enfield said Sir Norbert is meant less as a specific Olivier
parody than as a synthesis of British greats. Aficionados will spot
references to Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole and Donald Sinden,
among many others.
   The actors not sent up in the Sir Norbert character get their
comeuppance from fictitious colleagues such as Will Silly and Sir
Donald Stuffy.
   ``I put in every British actor that I've ever met,'' said
Enfield, who worked six years ``off and on'' on the script, and
found periodic unemployment a great help.
   ``I used to watch a lot of afternoon TV,'' he said. ``I started
imitating the movies then.''
   ``Sir Norbert Smith: A Life'' marked a change of pace for the
performer, who studied politics at York University before making
his theater debut at the Edinburgh Festival fringe in Scotland in
1982.
   ``It was the first time I'd had to do comedy acting rather than
overacting,'' he said of Sir Norbert. ``It's part of the difference
between Robin Williams on stage and Robin Williams in `Dead Poets
Society.' ''
   In 1986, his career was launched playing Loadsamoney, an
avaricious working-class Yuppie, on ``Friday Night Live,'' a weekly
comedy series.
   The character touched such a nerve with the British that the
word was later cited in Parliamentary debates about Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's ``loadsamoney economy.''
   Enfield later created the character of Stavros, a Greek kebab
salesman with opinions on everything.
   In contrast to Loadsamoney, described by Enfield as ``a loud
git,'' Sir Norbert demanded a more subdued, concentrated style of
acting, with a chameleonic ability to switch from the aging
thespian to his younger cinematic selves.
   A new series, ``Harry Enfield's Television Program,'' began this
month on the BBC. Enfield takes on 15 roles, ranging from a
13-year-old with a speech problem to a pair of married slobs, Wayne
and Waynetta.
   The son of a local government officer from East Sussex, south of
London, Enfield seems moderately surprised by the direction his
life has taken. But he views it with a Loadsamoney kind of
pragmatism.
   ``It's something I fell into,'' he said. ``I'll stop doing it
when they stop paying me.''
