<TEXT>  She's played vixens and victims, Cinderella and a shopping bag lady. But in
Hollywood someone who's that good is likely to be labeled "character actor" --
i.e., not under consideration for leading roles. Warren says she doesn't care,
though. "Listen," she told Movieline, "I've been a character actress right
from the beginning. I was no more like Cinderella in my real life than I was
like the neurotic poet I played a couple of years ago in Cop." Warren turned
45 last month, which makes her the same age as some other actresses who are
beginning to find they're not on the list for the top roles -- Diane Keaton,
Sally Field, Susan Sarandon. But Warren doesn't think this will slow her down:
"Age has nothing to do with being the kind of actress who relies not on a
magnetic personality, but on disappearing into the person you're playing
instead. For my money, Michelle Pfeiffer's a character actress -- it's got
nothing to do with looks, or age, or whether it's the leading role."; ETHAN
HAWKE; (box) On the road in Redford country; Dead Poets Society established
Hawke as a teen idol, and gave him the chance to star in films like White Fang
and Mystery Date. But he's not such a celebrity that he couldn't indulge in a
fantasy and make a cross-country road trip this summer with a couple of
friends from New York. "I tried to be Jack Kerouac for a couple of weeks," he
told Michael Szymanksi. "It was so refreshing to see small towns where there
are still soda fountains in drugstores. We all live in New York caves and we
wanted to see what the hell was going on in the nation." So tell us, Ethan,
what is going on out there? "There are people out there who are just now
hearing about Kevin Costner. They're still stuck on Robert Redford." Good
heavens, is education in the heartland that backward?; MERCEDES RUEHL; (box)
Are women about to get their turn?; Broadway gave her a Tony Award for Neil
Simon's Lost in Yonkers. In Hollywood Ruehl has played Tom Hanks' mother in
Big and Dean Stockwell's wife in Married to the Mob, and appears with Jeff
Bridges in The Fisher King. "With each job, each project, each play and film,
I'm not only finding out who I am artistically as an actress . . . I'm finding
out who I am period," Ruehl told Candace Burke-Block. "It works both ways."
The only problem is that oft-mentioned dearth of good parts for women. "The
film industry," she notes, "is still basically run by men (and) there is a lot
of concentration on the nature of men: men's problems with violence, men's
problems in general -- with each other, with sexuality and with women. But it
is going to come around. I think it already is starting on the other cycle.
After all, how many sexes are there?"; RUBEN BLADES; (box) Non-traditional
casting; Quick, name a Latino actor who isn't Edward James Olmos, Raul Julia,
Jimmy Smits or Ruben Blades. If all you can come up with is Ricardo Montalban,
you get the point. But to Blades even that many seems like progress. "Things
have begun to change," he told the Los Angeles Times. "When I began the only
name was Raul Julia." But Hollywood still assumes that though North Americans
play Latinos in movies, it can't work the other way around: "We are at a
disadvantage," says Blades, who was born in Panama. "When I say 'we,' I am not
only talking about Latinos, but anybody else who happens not to have English
as a first language. They don't come to me if they are going to do a Custer
movie and cast me as Custer. They say, 'He is not a North American. How can he
play Custer?' But there's not a moment's hesitation that someone like William
Hurt can play a Latino."  </TEXT>
