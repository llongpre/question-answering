   Singer David Crosby, comic Jay Leno and
wrestler Hulk Hogan straddled motorcycles Sunday and led thousands
of bikers on ``Love Ride 7'' to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.
   ``For some crazy reason we feel that if we all ride together
maybe we can come up with enough money and a miracle to whip this
disease,'' Hogan said before heading out for an afternoon
rendezvous in the Malibu hills.
   The wrestler said he got involved because he's a parent and
cares about kids.
   ``I've had mothers call me up and cry and kids beg me to help,''
Hogan said. ``I've seen it all.''
   Last year, the event attracted 7,000 bikers and raised more than
$500,000 for MDA. This year's crowd was estimated to reach 10,000
by the end of the day.
   The ``Love Ride'' is a 100-mile journey from a Harley-Davidson
dealership in Glendale to the Calamigos Ranch in the Santa Monica
Mountains north of Malibu. Participants pledge a minimum $40 and
are treated to an afternoon of food and music, including
performances by Crosby and Jackson Browne.
   Proceeds benefit MDA's six Los Angeles County clinics.

   NEW YORK (AP) - What's inspiration sound like in the brain of
comedian and actor Robin Williams? Something like ``Bing!''
   Williams says some of his happiest moments have been when his
improvisation comes together while he's doing a stand-up comedy
routine.
   ``When you find that new idea, when you come up with a concept
and find that it works, it's the creation of the moment that's so
incredible,'' Williams said in Sunday's The New York Times
Magazine.
   ``And you know, they've discovered there actually is a slight
endorphin release during creative moments,'' he said, referring to
a brain chemical. ``It's like, Bing! This is part of evolution.''
   Williams, who has been nominated for two Academy Awards for his
roles in ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``Dead Poets Society,''
stars in the movie ``Awakenings,'' which is due out next month.
   ``Awakenings,'' which also stars Robert De Niro, is based on a
book of medical case studies by the neurologist Oliver Sacks.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Andy Griffith says he'll take down his
lawyer's shingle after this season, his fifth as the title
character of NBC's ``Matlock.''
   ``I'm financially comfortable. I'm in my 60s and there's no
reason to stay around,'' the 64-year-old actor said in the Nov. 17
issue of TV Guide. ``After this season, I'm leaving, and that's
it.''
   But the show's executive producer, Fred Silverman, said he
thinks the odds are 50-50 that Griffith will sign for another
season.
   Griffith says Silverman is wrong.
   ``I know I want to go home, is all. ... I don't need any
pressure on me, people thinking they see an opening and coming
after me,'' Griffith said. ``I went through that, one season in the
'60s, and I lost all of my determination to quit then. I'd just as
soon not see that happen again.''
   Griffith planned on quitting CBS's ``The Andy Griffith Show'' in
1967 after seven seasons. His contract had expired and he hoped to
prove wrong those who attributed his success in the role of Andy
Taylor ``to some nonsense that I was only playing myself.''
   But the network offered him a salary figure he called
staggering, and he relented.
   Now, Griffith said, ``it's time to wrap it up.''
   ``I've enjoyed the show, but I don't need this grind anymore,''
he said. ``Time to move on. I want to go home.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - What's money, anyway, reasons Ray Charles, who
says that after all, he can sleep in only ``one bed at a time.''
   In the Nov. 17 issue of People magazine, Charles said he doesn't
buy into some of the praise his peers have heaped on him over the
years, such as Frank Sinatra's once calling him ``the only genius
in the business.''
   ``I'll get all the accolades, but at my best I will never make
half the money Sinatra has made,'' said Charles, known for such
hits as ``Hit the Road, Jack'' and ``What'd I Say.''
   ``But when you break it down, what does it matter? I can only
sleep in one bed at at a time. I can only make love to one woman at
a time,'' he said.
   Charles, 60, has nine children, ages 14 to 40, by seven women,
and seven grandchildren.
