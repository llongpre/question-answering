   The Tokyo International Film Festival, still a
fledgling event its third time around, is making its mark by
awarding the largest cash prize at any film festival to young and
first-time filmmakers from around the world.
   This year, Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso won the Sakura Gold
prize of $143,000 for ``Yaaba'' (``Old Woman''). The Sakura Silver
prize of $71,000 went to Shunichi Nagasaki of Japan for ``The
Enchantment.''
   The 30 million yen ($214,000) prize represents a significant
amount of freedom, said director George Miller (``Witches of
Eastwick,'' ``Mad Max''), a member of the jury that also included
actor Willem Dafoe.
   ``I don't know any young filmmaker who wouldn't regard that
amount of money as something very useful to their career,'' Miller
said. ``I think the Tokyo festival may become known as a major
attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the
recognition.''
   The 10-day festival ended Oct. 8 with ``Dead Poets Society,''
starring Robin Williams. It presented 133 movies, including Bill
Forsyth's ``Breaking In,'' Ron Howard's ``Parenthood'' and Yahoo
Serious' ``Young Einstein.''
   The grand prize went to ``That Summer of White Roses'' by Rajko
Grlic of Yugoslavia. A Special Jury Prize was given to
``Intergirl'' by the Soviet Union's Pyotr Todorovsky. Other winners
included: Elena Yakovleva, ``Intergirl'' (best actress); and Marlon
Brando, ``A Dry White Season'' (best actor).
   The Young Cinema Competition was established at the first Tokyo
festival in 1985 to encourage young directors with cash prizes of
$1.5 million.
   But the cash prize shrunk after festival organizers discovered
that some of the winners were constrained at home in using the
money solely for new film projects, and others subsequently
produced less-than-commercial movies with the money.
   Still, the competition is an attraction to young directors. Some
327 movies were entered in this year's festival, and the field was
narrowed to 17 films from 14 countries.
   The Tokyo Festival, held every other year, is still trying to
find its place among the more glamorous and prestigious film
festivals of the world, such as the Cannes Film Festival in France.
The Tokyo event is neither a center of behind-the-scenes dealmaking
nor a site of many important world premieres.
   ``The Tokyo festival is purely a matter of international
prestige,'' said Vincent Tolentino, Hollywood correspondent for the
French entertainment magazine Telerama.
   ``No one makes deals here, and most of the films have been seen
before at other festivals. Producers and film distributors might
touch base, but it's all public relations,'' he said.
   But festival organizers saw an opportunity to boost the film
projects of fledgling directors using one thing of which Japan has
plenty: money.
   ``We're certainly not the first film festival, so we started the
young cinema competition because we wanted to be known for
something special,'' said Michio Morioka, director of the
festival's ``Young Cinema Competition.''
   ``We regard it as very important to aid the abilities and
talents of young filmmakers,'' said Morioka, a former producer with
Toho Co., one of Japan's major movie companies.
   The fesitval costs about $5 million and about 10 percent comes
from the government. Because of the high costs, it isn't an annual
event such as most international film gatherings.
   The world's biggest and most publicity-prone film fesitval, at
Cannes, now gives $39,000 to the winner of its young director's
award, and the Montreal, Canada, festival awards 50,000 Canadian
dollars ($42,700) to the best first film.
   Another feature of the young cinema competition is that
directors, and often actors, attend public showings of their films
and appear onstage afterwards to discuss the movie with the
audience.
   During one such discussion, Eric Rochant, the 28-year-old
director of ``Tough Life,'' was told by a young man that in the
Japanese studio system, an aspiring film director must labor as
long as 15 or 20 years before getting the chance to make his own
feature-length film.
   Rochant said he, too, had to fight the odds, and to circumvent
the usual way of making a film in France to create ``Tough Life,''
the story of a young Parisian's alienation from life and love.
   ``In cinema, you must take risks like in everything else. The
only way to do it is to do it,'' he said.
