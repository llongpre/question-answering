<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "Oman Purchased the Tamara </F>
Radar System, but the Americans Are Assessing It"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Tamara passive radar system, a Czech 
state-of-the-art air-defense product, was evidently exported 
illegally to the United States in 1991. This statement was made 
by an Army source, who, with reference to his position, does not 
wish to be named. 
  He said that, according to the customs and commercial 
documents, Tamara should have been exported to Oman. However, 
it was not transported to the Arab sultanate but was exported 
from the Czech Republic to the United States via a Polish port, 
said the source. 
  The U.S. Department of Defense was interested in Tamara. 
According to the experts, the Czech radar system can reveal even 
the "invisible" Stealth aircraft, whose development cost the 
Pentagon billions of dollars. The U.S. Department of Defense, 
therefore, decided to have a look at Tamara. 
  However, Czechoslovakia would obviously not have sold Tamara 
to the Americans because U.S. research would have diminished the 
customers' interest in this product. 
  Jaromir Novotny, director of the Defense Ministry's Foreign 
Relations Department, has confirmed that the Americans now own 
Tamara. 
  The Trade and Industry Ministry has confirmed that, in 1991, 
a license was granted to Tesla Pardubice, the manufacturer of 
Tamara, to export the radar system to Oman. It is apparent from 
the documentation available that the Omani Defense Ministry had 
pledged to be its end user. 
  Germany is the only Western country to have this 
state-of-the-art radar system in its arsenal; it acquired it 
after the dissolution of the GDR National People's Army. 
Communist Czechoslovakia had sold Tamara and its predecessor, 
Ramona, only to the Soviet Union and Syria. 
  Josef Opocensky, the director of the Tesla Pardubice state 
enterprise, does not know anything about Tamara being exported 
to the United States and insists that it was sold to Oman.
