<TEXT>     The dominance of Metallica and Huey Lewis and the News was anticipated. The

Area's most popular acts.;   Fremont's Hammer, one of the top rappers in the
country, scored with three nominations based on his album "Too Legit To Quit."
And Isaak and his group Silvertone received four nominations.;   A notable

Cheese." (The group was nominated for Outstanding Group, and Les Claypool was
nominated for Outstanding Bassist.);   The nominations are solicited from a
