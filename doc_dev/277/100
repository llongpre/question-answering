   A Czechoslovakian rock band whose
leaders were jailed in the 1970s is touring the United States in
what its guitarist calls ``a sign of better times'' for Eastern
Europe.
   Initially denounced as ``moral filth'' by the government-run
Czech press, the band endured two decades of legal trouble before
obtaining official status last May and changing its name from
Plastic People of the Universe to Pulnoc, the Czech word for
midnight.
   The three-week American tour, which began Saturday in Chicago,
is the group's first opportunity to perform abroad and ``an
incredible turn of events that no one could have dreamed of even a
few years ago,'' said Timothy W. Ryback, a Harvard University
lecturer and expert on Eastern European rock.
   Although little known in the West, the group has attracted an
enormous following in Czechoslovakia through underground recordings
and small concerts under its original name, Ryback said.
   ``For 20 years, the Plastic People have been unquestionably the
premiere underground rock band in Czechoslovakia and probably all
of Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   At a nightclub here Sunday night, the band's lead singer and
only female member, Michaela Nemcova, traced haunting melodies over
a background of guitars, keyboards, drums and cello.
   The crowd, mainly students from nearby Mount Holyoke and Smith
Colleges, responded with three encores even though the Czech lyrics
were incomprehensible to most.
   ``We're not touring just for ourselves, but for everyone back
home,'' guitarist Milan Hlavsa, 39, said after the show. ``It's a
sign of better times, of hope, for our country.''
   Hlavsa, one of the band's original members, dedicated Sunday's
show to dissident playwright Vaclav Havel and the band's former
manager, Ivan Jirous, who are both in Czech prisons for political
crimes.
   But Hlavsa, who also spent six months in jail during a
government crackdown on rock bands in 1976, insisted the group's
message was not political.
   ``To us, rock 'n' roll means life, joy and creativity, and to
our fans, it means they can unwind, they can feel some sort of
freedom,'' he said through an interpreter. ``But I know it can be
dangerous, even if it's not political.''
   Hlavsa and guitarist Jiri Kabes formed Plastic People in 1968,
shortly after Soviet tanks rolled into the Czech capital to crush
the democratic social and political movement known as Prague Spring.
   At first, they were tolerated by the authorities. But in 1970,
their official status was revoked and they emerged as leaders in
what Jirous termed Czechoslovakia's ``second,'' or unofficial,
culture.
   Despite their popularity, all of the band members must work at
other jobs to support themselves. Keyboardist Josef Janicek is a
school janitor; drummer Petr Kumamdzas, a hospital orderly; cellist
Tomas Schilla, an X-ray technician.
   Ryback, the Harvard expert, said the band's recent acceptance of
official status has eased their circumstances, allowing them to
obtain top-quality equipment, to perform openly and, perhaps in the
future, to issue albums through the state record company.
   But, he said, the move was controversial.
   ``I think they have alienated some of their fans, because it
looks like they cut a deal with the state,'' he said. ``But that's
probably unfair, because they have gone through a hell of a lot.''
   The band also planned to go to New York, Knoxville, Tenn.,
Washington, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston, performing mainly in
nightclubs with a capacity of 100 to 400.
