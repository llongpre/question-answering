<LEADPARA>  A California Court of Appeal refused Tuesday to allow a former female student
to sue the University of California, Berkeley, over her alleged rape by four
university football players after a dormitory party in 1986.;    The court
rejected the former student's claim that the university was negligent for,
among other things, housing females on the same floor as males -- particularly
football players -- who, her attorneys alleged, were unusually prone to group
sex crimes.  </LEADPARA>

RAPE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     While condemning the "outrageous and reprehensible conduct" by the players,
the panel held 3-0 that the university may not be held liable for offenses
committed by its students.;    Through the years, campuses have moved away
from intensive regulations on student conduct and have become "microcosms of
society," the court said.;    "Unfortunately, sexually degrading conduct or
violence in general -- and violence against women in particular -- are all too
common within society at large," Appellate Justice J. Clinton Peterson wrote
for the court. "College administrators have a moral duty to help educate
students in this respect, but they do not have a legal duty to respond in
damages for student crimes.";    Pauline H. Tesler, a San Francisco attorney
representing the former student, said an appeal to the California Supreme
Court is being considered.;    "We think it's wrong that the university should
randomly place together young men and women who don't know each other, let
them drink alcohol, and then say, 'It's not our fault' when something like
this happens," Tesler said. "If that's the law, the taxpayers of California
ought to know about it.";    An attorney for the university, Peter W. Davis of
Oakland, welcomed the ruling. "When young people come to college, it's a time
for maturation, and we can't treat them like they were in kindergarten or high
school and achieve the goals you have in a university setting," he said.;   
Davis rejected the contention by lawyers for the former student that football
players should not be permitted to commingle with others in a coed dorm. "Such
a policy would condemn these athletes in advance and make them social
pariahs," he said.;    The dorm incident, which created a campus furor, took
place when the student was 17. She is seeking a master's degree at an
out-of-state institution. Although university regulations prohibit use of
alcohol by minors, the student and others at the party had been drinking,
according to court documents.;    The student said she was raped by one player
in a darkened stairwell, then taken to a room where she was raped by three
others. Alameda County authorities declined to prosecute the four players. In
separate campus disciplinary proceedings, the four underwent counseling,
performed community service and wrote letters of apology to the woman.;   
Attorneys for the woman brought a civil suit for damages against the
university, contending that its officials were negligent in permitting coed
housing and failing to take other steps that could have prevented the attack.
Citing sociological studies and news reports, the suit said the university
should have been aware that there is an inordinate likelihood of group sexual
attacks by closely knit groups of men -- such as football players or
fraternity members.;    Alameda Superior Court Judge Dawn B. Girard dismissed
the suit. The appeal court upheld the dismissal, with Appellate Justice John
Benson joining Peterson's 12-page opinion and Justice J. Anthony Kline filing
a separate concurring opinion.  </TEXT>
