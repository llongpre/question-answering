<LEADPARA>  There was little of the usual joy on the last day of the school year Thursday
at Granada High in Livermore.;    Students arriving to take final exams and to
clean out their lockers for the summer were greeted with the news -- if they
didn't already know -- that one of their classmates had been murdered, her
body left by the side of the road and set on fire.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The school district's crisis team was dispatched to help students and
teachers deal with the death of Jessica Ann McHenry, a quiet ninth-grader. The
teachers, in a meeting before school, were told to be as honest and factual as
possible in discussing the murder with students, according to vice principal
Bob See.;    "Students have different reactions," See said. "Some classes are
silent, others have a lot of questions.";    As of Thursday evening,
detectives were still looking for suspects and had few leads, according to
Sgt. Jim Knudsen of the Alameda County Sheriff's Department. Detectives would
not say how Jessica was killed, or if she had been sexually assaulted.;   
Investigators are exploring possible links between Jessica's murder and at
least two other incidents, he acknowledged.;    In January, a woman believed
to be in her 20s was killed with a blow to the head, her body dumped and set
on fire in Palomares Canyon, between Fremont and Castro Valley. The isolated,
hilly geography of Palomares Canyon is similar to that of Tesla Road.;    And
in May, a burly man grabbed a 13-year-old girl off a quiet street in Sunol and
forced her into his car. She escaped after a struggle and described him to
sheriff's deputies as a white man in his 40s with a pot belly. He had
collar-length, reddish-brown hair, a beard and mustache, and wore a hoop
earring in his right ear. His car was similar to a mid-1970s Chevrolet Monte
Carlo.;    Detectives learned a lot about Jessica from talking to students
Thursday, but nothing about who might have killed her, Knudsen said.;   
Although there have been deaths at Granada High School before -- the result of
car accidents and illnesses -- Jessica's murder was the first, See said. And
because it remains unsolved, there is fear that the killer could strike
again.;    But that fear, See said, seems to grip parents more than students.;
   "Kids just don't see this as happening to them. They see it as happening to
someone else. It's the parents who are really calling, fearful of their kids
being out in the community," he said.;    Outside the school, some students
lingered in groups. They described Jessica as a quiet, "nice" 14-year-old who
was not active in school affairs.;    "It's really sad," said one junior, who
asked that her name not be published.;    Jessica left school on foot around
12:30 p.m. Tuesday, carrying a green backpack with a school yearbook inside.
There were reports, See said, that she was seen an hour later, walking alone
near Livermore City Hall, about four miles away.;    Around 4 p.m. motorists
on hilly, rural Tesla Road, about 10 miles outside Livermore, spotted smoke
about 200 yards from the pavement and stopped to check on the source. They
found Jessica's body, the upper half still smoldering.;    Her death has hit
her family -- who have declined to be interviewed -- hard, Knudsen said. "I
wasn't at the home, but the detectives who were there said, as you can
imagine, it was pretty rough," he said.;    The sheriff's department is asking
anyone with information about the case to phone the department at 667-3600.  </TEXT>
