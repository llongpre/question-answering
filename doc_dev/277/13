   The Italian government has agreed to explore
possible collaboration in building the ``super collider'' atom
smasher planned by the Energy Department, Energy Secretary John
Herrington said Thursday.
   The agreement does not represent a commitment to contribute to
the cost of the $4.4 billion installation, but department officials
said collaborative projects could lead to concrete cost savings
even if no cash were given.
   The United States and Italy already collaborate in some energy
research. A joint statement issued Thursday by Herrington and
Gianni Ravaglia, deputy minister of industry, commerce and
handicrafts, at the conclusion of the annual review of the work
said the two men had ``endorsed the need to explore ways of
achieving joint undertakings'' to support the super collider.
   The administration is asking Congress for $363 million to begin
construction in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1., but there is
considerable resistance to the high overall cost. Some members have
asked Herrington to produce evidence that other countries will
contribute, or committments by them, to back up his assertions that
a quarter to a half the project cost could come from other
countries.
   A site for the machine, a 53-miles (85 km) around underground
tunnel, is expected to be chosen in November. Sites in North
Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado and
Tennessee are being considered.
   George J. Bradley, principal deputy assistant secretary for
international affairs and energy emergencies, told reporters that
smaller sums being mentioned in Congress would not convince
potential foreign contributors that the United States was committed
to the collider.
   Asked specifically about discussions about allocating $200
million for the project, he said, ``It's not enough.''
   If other countries are convinced the United States is going
ahead, they will undertake ``complementary program'' that might
include other types of less expensive high-energy accelerators. But
without a U.S. super collider, they might decide that they need to
collaborate on building one themselves _ and they need to make such
decisions in the coming year or so, Bradley said.
   Thus, he said, $200 million is not enough because ``the key here
is schedule slippage'' _ such a sum would delay the U.S. project
somewhat, and foreign countries would be forced to make decisions
without knowledge of U.S. intentions.
   He declined to specify a particular sum other than the $363
million as ``enough.''
   To explore the secrets of matter and energy, the super collider
would whirl beams of protons into each other at collision energies
20 times higher than the most powerful machines today.
   Italy's help might be particularly welcome, Bradley said,
because that country is the only one so far to build
superconducting magnets with a field strength anywhere near the
strength the super collider beam-bending magnets would use, about
6.6 Tesla or roughly 66,000 times the strength of the earth's
magnetic field. The Italian magnets are used at an accelerator near
Hamburg, West Germany.
   The most powerful U.S. magnets are about 4.4 Tesla. Scientists
have said they see no reason they can't build more powerful ones,
but the $363 million budget request includes about $32 million for
magnet research.
   ``If the Italians are willing to transfer that technology, you
don't have to spend'' that money, Bradley said.
   Italy's manufacturing capacity is only 500 magnets every three
years, while the super collider will require 10,000 magents
estimated to cost $100,000 each _ a $1 billion expenditure.
   If a magnet agreement were reached with Italy, U.S. firms, and
Italian firm or a joint venture might build a manufacturing plant
in the United States, Bradley said. Similar collaborations are
being discussed with several countries, he said.
   ``I can assure you it's not pie in the sky,'' Bradley said.
   Italy has a long tradition in advanced physics research, going
back to nuclear pioneer Enrico Fermi in the 1930s and extending
today to Carlo Rubbia, professor of physics at Harvard University
in Cambridge, Mass. and director-general of CERN (Centre d'Etudes
de Recherches Nucleaires), the multi-national European high-energy
physics reserach center near Geneva, Switzerland.
