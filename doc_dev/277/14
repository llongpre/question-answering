NOW HARD ROCKERS, RAPPERS SPREAD AIDS WARNING TOO 
</P>

The older, mainstream contingent of the pop world -- including Dionne Warwick, 
Elton John and Stevie Wonder -- has been active in raising public awareness of 
AIDS, but the hard-core rock community has been slow to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
That's why a Music Against Aids memorabilia auction on Sunday in Beverly Hills 
represents a breakthrough of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, will give pop fans a chance to bid on items 
donated by such mainstream stars as Michael Jackson (a Stetson fedora), Janet 
Jackson (jeans she wore in her "Rhythm Nation" video), Mick Jagger (a cape he 
wore on stage during the Rolling Stones' 1979 tour) and Prince (a 
limited-edition "Batman" CD). 
</P>
<P>
But Howard Portugais, a member of the board of governors of the academy's Los 
Angeles chapter and one of the organizers of the event, whose proceeds will go 
to the American Foundation for AIDS Research, feels it is especially 
significant that some anti-Establishment hard rockers and rappers are lending 
support. They include members of the groups Faster Pussycat and the Beastie 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in a position to change something or say something, it's kind of a 
cop-out if you don't," said Faster Pussycat's guitarist Brent Muscat, who 
believes some hard-rockers might fear that speaking about AIDS would chink 
their devil-may-care armor. 
</P>
<P>
Muscat got involved in Sunday's event -- he is donating a gold jacket that he 
wore on stage during the band's last tour and also serving as an event 
spokesman -- after seeing an MTV news feature in which Bangles member Susanna 
Hoffs talked about the auction and gave a phone number for volunteers and 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Wow! I wish I was involved,' " said Muscat, 22. "I've always been 
interested (in AIDS) and read up on it. The guys in my band talk about it a 
lot, and we're really concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people still view it as a gay and drug-user disease. But even 
if it was . . . it's everybody's problem. People are people. It's something 
that's gonna affect everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Hard-rock involvement with the issue has been checkered at best. Last spring 
Guns N' Roses was scheduled to headline a New York benefit for the Gay Men's 
Health Crisis organization. 
</P>
<P>
But gay activists, incensed at what they believed were anti-gay references in a 
Guns N' Roses song, insisted that the band be removed from the bill. 
(Representatives of Guns N' Roses did not respond to requests for interviews 
for this article.) Last year, members of Poison, discussing their computer log 
of groupies around the country, joked that safe sex meant not falling out of 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see groups that are really image-conscious saying they'd rather not 
talk about it," said Brian Wheat, bassist of the Sacramento-based band Tesla. 
"But, if the truth were to be known, I'm sure all those guys wear condoms. No 
one wants to die that death, whether you're a bad boy of rock 'n' roll or not." 
</P>
<P>
But Wheat -- who was unaware of the auction when contacted by The Times -- 
admitted that the storied rock 'n' roll life style calls for extra 
consideration in the face of AIDS. Though three of the five members of Tesla 
are married and Wheat has a steady girlfriend, he acknowledged: "Hard-rock 
bands are pretty promiscuous. . . . You can't go, 'It will never happen to me.' 
It has nothing to do with image." 
</P>
<P>
Portugais, a manager who has worked with Dusty Springfield, Groucho Marx and 
other show-business figures, and other organizers of Sunday's event said it is 
particularly important for members of the hard-rock community to speak out 
because of statistics that suggest that an it-can't-happen-to-me attitude is 
still prevalent among teens, the primary audience for hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
So why aren't many hard-rock stars speaking out against AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are a little ignorant," said Muscat. "For some of the hard-rock 
people maybe it hasn't hit home, but it's going to and people are going to wake 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Burt Bacharach, co-writer of the song "That's What Friends Are For," which has 
raised more than $1 million for AIDS research and education since it was 
released in 1985, agrees that teen hard-rock fans are the greatest challenge 
and the key target in the AIDS awareness campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Any major heavy-metal group saying that this is important, the attention it 
would call, the money it would raise," Bacharach said. "It would have a 
powerful impact on young people." 
</P>
<P>
But while Bacharach admits to "high frustration" at the failure to get the 
message to teens, he is optimistic that things will change as AIDS touches more 
young people's lives. He's already seen awareness grow around the country 
through the acceptance of "That's What Friends Are For." 
</P>
<P>
But the very nature of the teen mind-set and rock 'n' roll bravado provides a 
major stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up and losing my virginity or whatever," said Muscat, "it 
was a kind of time where I was going for it . . . when I was 16 and in my 
rebellious period. But, as you get smarter, you calm down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The auction will be presented in two parts Sunday at the Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel: a noon event open to the public (admission $20) and a 5 p.m. auction of 
higher-ticketed items ($150, including cocktails and a buffet). Information: 
(818) 843-8253.
