<F P=106> [Article by Kevin Drew: "Slovakia Pushes Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--Slovak leaders are stepping up their 
economic reform program, pledging to put 100 billion Sk ($3.3 
billion) worth of companies on the market when the second wave 
of privatization is launched in September. Around 300 
companies, representing 33 percent of all state-owned property, 
are slated to go on the auction block this fall. In comparison, 
only 3 percent privatized between June 1992, when Vladimir 
Meciar was elected prime minister, and last month, when 
parliament forced him out of office. 
  The drive towards privatization, timed to hit on the eve of 
the national elections scheduled for Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, is 
being urged along by government officials and economists who 
want to reinstill in the international community the confidence 
that Slovakia is committed to reform. "The aim is to push 
privatization so far that no future government could reverse it, 
not even Meciar," said one Western advisor who wished to remain 
anonymous. 
  Inheritors of the poorer half of the former Czechoslovak 
nation, Slovak leaders have managed to make some progress 
towards a market economy. The private sector now accounts for 
nearly 40 percent of economic activity and government debt is 
low compared to many other post-communist countries. 
  "It's not that Slovakia has backpedaled or done poorly," 
said 
Andreas Georgiou, resident representative of the International 
Monetary Fund. "Slovakia hasn't progressed as rapidly as it 
could have, but it has progressed." 
  Between 1989 and 1992, 30 percent of the Slovak economy was 
privatized. But soon after Meciar was elected prime minister in 
June 1992, the Slovak government announced it was slowing the 
pace of privatization, arguing that rapid reforms could backfire 
by creating skyrocketing inflation, unemployment and public 
discontent. 
  A number of the privatization projects carried out under 
Meciar's government have since been attacked as illegal. Early 
this month, for instance, the parliamentary committee for 
privatization found that 13 projects approved by the Meciar 
administration in February violated the government's own 
privatization rules by giving advantages to a select group of 
buyers. 
  The former government approved the direct sale of state 
companies to pre-selected buyers, even though the buyers of some 
firms such as Tesla Stropkov, Skloobal Nemsova, ZOS Vrutkz and 
ZOS Trnava could not demonstrate that they had enough financial 
resources to develop the companies. 
  The slowdown in privatization never achieved its goals, 
however. Under Meciar, unemployment and inflation shot up 
because the government never implemented a clear reform path. 
Budget deficits began to mount. 
  Unemployment in Slovakia now stands at 15 percent, compared 
to 3 percent in the Czech Republic; inflation is 15 percent, 
compared to the annualized Czech rate of 10 percent; and the 
average monthly income is $160, compared to over $200 in the 
Czech Republic. 
  The slowdown of privatization also sent warning signals to 
international investors initially eager to capitalize on 
Slovakia's well-trained and cheap labor poor. By mid-1992, only 
122 Slovak companies had U.S. investment, totaling just $20 
million. 
  "Investors don't like uncertainty," said Douglas Swaim, 
senior investment officer of the Slovak-American Enterprise 
Fund. "From the inside, we're convinced that Slovakia will 
stabilize. But from the outside, you have to wonder." 
  In the six months left before the fall elections, the new 
government hopes to assuage such fears. "We must finish our 
attempts at macroeconomic stability as well as microeconomic 
stability," Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus told reporters 
recently. 
  Government leaders intend to reduce this year's projected 
budget deficit from 23 billion Sk to 6 billion Sk, lower 
inflation to 13 percent and keep unemployment under 17 percent. 
Courting foreign aid and smoothing trade relations with the 
Czech Republic are also priorities. 
  "To some degree, Slovakia is a diamond in the rough," said 
Swaim. "If the country can get its act together with 
privatization and articulating a clear economic policy, it will 
have no trouble attracting investors."
