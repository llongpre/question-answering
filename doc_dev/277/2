<F P=106> [Article by Brendan McNally: "Passive-Aggressive Tamara: </F>
Tesla's `Stealthy' Radar That Could Revolutionize War-Making"] 
  [Text] In early 1992, members of the old federal parliament 
were amazed to hear senior military officer Oldrich Barak 
announce that the Czechoslovak army had a "stealth radar" called 
Tamara that had already demonstrated its ability to detect and 
identify the U.S. Air Force's multi-billion-dollar B-2 "Stealth" 
bomber. 
  Tamara surfaced again last summer when the Czech government, 
bowing to Western pressure, quashed an attempt to sell six 
Tamara systems to Iran. Since then, Tamara has rapidly become 
one of the Czech Republic's best-known pieces of military 
technology. 
  Despite being dubbed the "stealth radar," Tamara is in fact 
not even a radar. Radar systems "see" by actively bouncing radio 
waves off objects, while Tamara is a purely passive system that 
detects the radiation and electronic signals inevitably emitted 
by even the stealthiest aircraft. 
  "If a B-2 bomber uses even its altimeter, we'll see them," 
Barak said. 
  The ability to detect supposedly invisible aircraft like the 
B-2 sparks the popular imagination. But, for defense experts, 
Tamara's ability to "see without being seen" is a much more 
important quality. In the radar-dominated "electronic 
battlefield" that has existed since World War II, the ability to 
see has invariably meant being seen as well. 
  As a non-radiating passive surveillance system, Tamara has 
effectively broken away from this structure. As a result, some 
believe it could radically alter the balance of modern 
conventional warfare. 
  For this reason, some consider Tamara a potentially 
revolutionary "weapon." 
  Tamara uses artificial intelligence to correlate and 
evaluate 
information. It can even "teach itself" to discern new patterns 
and identify new targets, according to Barak. 
  When discussing Tamara, Barak likes to stress its 
non-military applications. Because the system does not radiate 
energy, Barak said Tamara could be an alternative to airport 
radars in residential areas, where radar saturation could pose 
health risks. Tamara could also be useful in monitoring coastal 
shipping routes such as the English Channel or the North Sea 
coast. 
  Tesla Pardubice began developing passive Electronic 
Intelligence--or ELINT--systems during the late 1960s with an 
experimental system called Kopac. This was followed in the late 
1970s by the second-generation system Ramona, at least one of 
which was sold to Syria. Tamara was developed during the late 
'80s. 
  Only a few Tamaras have actually been sold abroad, Barak 
said. "There are 15 sets within Russia [and] some in the Czech 
and Slovak republics. The German Bundeswehr (federal army) has 
one Tamara and one Ramona." 
  Barak said that attempts to sell Tamara to Iran began before 
he assumed his post. "We haven't had any discussions with Iran 
[since that time]," he said. "We cannot sell Tamara without the 
permission of the government." 
  To sell Tamara to Western militaries, Barak said he knows 
he'll have to break through both the West's prejudice against 
Eastern-bloc hardware and a more powerful prejudice known as the 
"NIH syndrome," which applies to products "not invented here." 
  Does Barak dream of the day when Tamara is part of the 
Pentagon's arsenal? Yes. 
  But, he said, "There is one already in the U.S. somewhere. 
It 
was bought from another country. I don't know from where."
