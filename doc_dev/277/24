<TEXT>     "He's not considered a suspect," Knudsen said. "We just want to talk with
him.";    Jessica's partially clothed body was found about 4 p.m. Tuesday
along Tesla Road, south of Livermore. It had been set afire, and was still
smoldering when police were called to the scene by passing motorists.;   
Knudsen said police have received tips that place the girl near College Avenue
and South L Street in Livermore at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday.;    Around that time,
police said, she may have gotten into a car with a male teen-ager with
medium-length dirty blond hair, wearing a baseball cap. The car is described
as a beige, older model, American-made two-door sedan.;    Police also are
looking for Jessica's teal green backpack, which she was reportedly carrying
before she was killed.;    Anyone with information in the case can call the
sheriff's department at (415) 667-7721.  </TEXT>
