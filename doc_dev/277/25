<LEADPARA>  Alameda County Sheriff's Department investigators say they've obtained
descriptions of two pickup trucks seen near Tesla Road in Livermore, the site
where a teen-ager's body was found June 11. Jessica McHenry, 14, was
strangled, and her body partially burned. Officials say one truck is a blue
Ford F150 full-size pickup driven by a white male. The second is believed to
be a two-tone red Ford F250 4x4 Lariat pickup with silver or white sides.
Investigators say the driver of the second vehicle may have been a 20-year-old
white male, cleanshaven, with brown hair and a tan. A passenger in that pickup
is described as a 20-year-old white male with brown hair and a mustache, and
wearing sunglasses. Investigators ask that anyone who recognizes those
descriptions call (415) 272-6909.  </LEADPARA>
