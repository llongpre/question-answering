  [Text] On 19 November, Toshiba Corporation announced that 
by successfully making a product out of a freezer unit with 
cooling capability down to the temperature of liquid helium 
(absolute temperature 4.2K, or -269ÎC), it had developed a 
small-scale superconducting magnet (see photo [omitted]) that 
does not use liquid helium. Until now, a niobium-titanium 
(Nb-Ti) superconducting magnet could not be used because direct 
cooling type freezers could not freeze below 10K. However, 
cooling down to 4.2K has become possible with the new freezer, 
and the size of the container also has been reduced to about 
one-third of existing units, so that a high magnetic field of 6 
tesla can be created in a large-diameter (internal diameter 18 
centimeters), normal temperature space. Toshiba claims that this 
will broaden substantially the sectors of commercial application 
of superconducting magnets. 
  The superconducting magnet system developed by Toshiba 
incorporates a small-scale freezer unit, which is a modification 
of the Gifford McMahon (GM) freezer that is used most widely 
today. Existing freezers could not cool below 10K, so it was 
necessary to use Nb[.sup]3[/], tin, etc., but on this 
occasion, cooling down to the 4K level was realized by such 
steps as finding magnetic material with high specific heat at 
temperatures below 10K for use as heat storing material. 
  In addition, an oxide superconductor, which has little heat 
conduction and feeds current even in strong magnetic fields, was 
used for the power lead through which current is fed to the 
superconducting coil, and this led to reduction of cooling 
temperature. 
  Because of this, it has become possible to realize a 
small-scale, high magnetic field with a Nb-Ti superconducting 
magnet, the most popular type that used to require liquid helium 
cooling, even by using a direct cooling type freezer. 
  The container that houses the magnet is 65 centimeters (cm) 
wide, 50 cm deep and 49 cm high, as small as a 25 cm television, 
and use has been simplified to just switching on the freezer. 
  Toshiba maintains that almost all superconducting magnets 
for 
both industrial and research use can be used with this freezer, 
and that the process can be freed from the complicated liquid 
helium cooling method.
