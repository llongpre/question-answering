  [Text] Toshiba Corp. (Fumio Sato, president) announced on 
19 November that it has developed a small superconductor magnet 
without using liquid helium, by commercializing a refrigerating 
machine that can cool to the temperature of liquid helium 
(absolute temperature of 4.2ÎK=-269ÎC). Since 
conventional refrigeration machines have not been able to go 
below 10ÎK, niobium titanium superconductor magnets could 
not be used, but since with this new refrigeration machine 
cooling to 4.2ÎK is possible and the container is 
approximately one-third the size of conventional ones, it is 
possible to generate a strong magnetic field of six tesla in a 
large diameter room temperature space, which has an internal 
diameter of 18 cm. Toshiba believes that there will be a great 
expansion in the fields using superconductor magnets. 
  The superconductor magnet system that was developed 
incorporates a small refrigeration machine that is an 
improvement on the Gifford-McMahon (GM) type refrigeration 
machines that are most commonly in use at present. Since 
conventional refrigeration machines could not cool below 
10ÎK, niobium 3-tin, etc. had to be used, but by finding 
regenerative materials with large specific heats below 10ÎK, 
Toshiba was able to attain cooling in the 4ÎK range. 
  In addition, an oxide superconductor which has low thermal 
conductivity and in which current flows well in a strong 
magnetic field is used for the power lead that brings current to 
the superconductor coil, and this is connected to the reduction 
in cooling temperature. 
  With this it is possible to use the main current niobium 
titanium superconductor magnet, for which liquid helium cooling 
had been necessary, with a direct cooling refrigeration machine, 
and a strong magnetic field can be generated with a small unit. 
  The container that accommodates the magnetic field is 65 cm 
wide, 50 cm deep and 49 cm high, a small size about that of a 25 
inch television set, and all that must be done when it is used 
is to turn on a switch. 
  Toshiba says that almost all superconductor magnets, such as 
those for industry and research, can use this refrigeration 
machine, and it will release users from the complexity of using 
liquid helium cooling.
