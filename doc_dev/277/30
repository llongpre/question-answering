  [Text] Bratislava, April 6 (CTK) -- The approval of 13 
privatization projects on February 15-16 by the government of 
former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar was illegal, according to 
a report by the parliamentary Committee for Privatization. 
  The report said that Meciar's government had violated its 
own 
privatization concept by agreeing without justification to give 
advantages to a select group of buyers. Committee member Jozef 
Zselenak read the report in parliament today. 
  After accepting the report, parliament asked the committee 
to 
look into the government's approval of privatization projects 
approved between February 17 and March 11, the date the Meciar 
government fell from power. 
  According to the report, the Meciar government approved the 
direct sale of state companies to pre-selected buyers even if 
the buyers could not demonstrate their ability to make the first 
payments. For some firms -- such as Tesla Stropkov, Skloobal 
Nemsova, ZOS Vrutky and ZOS Trnava -- the buyers could not 
demonstrate that they had enough financial resources for 
developing the company. 
  In several cases, direct sales were approved even when there 
were competing buyers, whose offers were often better than the 
approved buyer. 
  Deputies of Meciar's now-opposition Movement for a 
Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) attacked the report as subjective, misleading, 
and "full of lies." One HZDS deputy said the report reminded 
him of the nationalization of 1948. "I hope the elections are 
not nullified and the 1950s replayed," he said. 
  Privatization Minister Milan Janicina dismissed HZDS 
accusations that members of the new coalition government wanted 
certain privatization projects for themselves, and reassured 
deputies that all of the 13 enterprises, whose privatizations 
were rescinded, would be re-entered in the privatization process.
