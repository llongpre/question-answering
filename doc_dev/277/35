<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "There Are Disputes Going On </F>
Regarding Exports of the Tamara System"] 
  [Excerpts] Prague--Despite the various disputes regarding 
the details of the operational results of the Tamara radar that 
are going on, the world is interested in this system that is 
capable of monitoring all types of aircraft. The Defense 
Ministries interested in buying the system include those of 
India, China, Iran, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. 
  Nevertheless, some military officials are skeptical about 
the 
export of this top-ranking product. It is rumored in military 
circles that the United States is interested in the 
nonproliferation of this equipment because, as one of a very few 
systems, it has the capability of detecting the "invisible" U.S. 
Stealth reconnaissance aircraft. If Iraq, for instance, owned 
Tamara, the billions spent on the development of Stealth would 
be wasted. [passage omitted] 
  Tamara is an original Czech discovery that was 35 years in 
the works. It is a system that, as opposed to other radars, 
which emit radio waves and evaluate their reflection, only 
receives radio impulses. Regarding the usage, it neither 
competes with nor replaces radar but, rather, adds to the radar 
information such important data as recognition of the type of 
aircraft or ship, and facilitates the verification of the flight 
or navigation route by an alternative physical method. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Its Predecessor Was Ramona </H5>
  At the end of the 1950's, a new, original method was 
discovered at the research institute of the then Czechoslovak 
Army that facilitated an immediate, unequivocal, and extremely 
precise determination of the location of electrical signal 
transmitters. The method is based on the so-called 
time-hyperbolic [casove hyperbolicky] principle. 
  The discovery did not remain just theory but was very 
rapidly 
applied. Already in the early 1960's, the Czechoslovak Army had 
at its disposal the precise PRP-1 Kopac [digger] radiotechnical 
finder; in the 1970's, the second generation of this technology 
under the name Ramona; and, in the 1980's, the third generation, 
called "Tamara." 
  Tamara is a passive radiotechnical system that provides an 
immediate survey of the activity of ground, water surface, and 
aerial sources of radiotechnical signals to a distance of 100 
km, determines their precise location, and is able to 
concurrently follow the routes and recognize dozens of types of 
aircraft or ships of practically all known categories. 
  Experts claim that, if the Tamara system were used, such 
tragedies as the downing of the KAL-007 airliner by a Soviet 
Su-15 fighter jet over Sakhalin in the night hours in September 
1983, or the downing of the Iranian transport Airbus-300 
aircraft by a U.S. Navy missile (from the Vincennes cruiser) in 
July 1987 over the Strait of Hormuz would not have taken place. 
Both instances were allegedly caused by errors. In the former 
case, the aircraft was confused with the U.S. F-16 
reconnaissance aircraft. One can safely assume that, in either 
case, there was no technical system available with the 
capability to recognize the types of aircraft with the 
determination precision needed. 
  More than 50 Ramona and Tamara systems have been produced in 
Czechoslovakia. The vast majority were exported to the then 
USSR, and one to the former GDR.
