<F P=106> [Article by Brendan McNally: "Without Inducements, </F>
Multinational Moves In"] 
  [Text] An international electronics company's 
decision to relocate a manufacturing facility from Germany to 
east Bohemia casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that 
governments must vie with one another--through tax breaks and 
other concessions--to attract business and industry. 
  An international electronics corporation will invest more 
than $30 million (870 million Kc) into a Czech factory, making 
it the largest British investment in this country to date. 
  AVX, a Japanese-American conglomerate with its European 
operations based in Great Britain, decided to move its 
manufacturing plant from Germany to Lanskroun, east Bohemia, 
despite the Czech government's flat refusal to provide tax 
breaks or other financial inducements. 
  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, speaking at the official 
opening of the factory May 12, said the project's success was a 
validation of his own free-market philosophy. 
  "I am glad such a success could take place just on general 
achievements, without any help from the government. And this is 
the way we'd like to demonstrate that it's not necessary to ask 
for special advantages or for a new trade policy. I think [AVX 
Czech Republic General Manager Jiri] Skala doesn't need my help 
or my expertise, because I would not be able to give it," Klaus 
said in English to a crowd of Czech, British, Japanese and 
American company officials. 
  While clearly disappointed that the government would not 
offer help, AVX company officials already consider the project a 
success. In just three months, the factory has become one of the 
world's largest producers of tantalum chip capacitors, a 
component used in cellular telephones, hearing aids and other 
electronic products. 
  "There were no tax advantages, nothing," said Ernest 
Chilton, 
senior vice president for AVX's tantalum capacitors division. 
"Our only inducement was comparative advantage." 
  Cheaper labor costs in the Czech Republic as compared to 
Germany was one of many factors that led the company to move its 
operations to Lanskroun, Chilton said. 
  "There are places with lower labor costs than the Czech 
Republic. But if you take the skills and the education level, we 
found that this has been the best place we can come to," he said. 
  AVX's Czech and British personnel described the opening as a 
significant achievement because the factory was up and running 
in only nine months, 14 months ahead of schedule. 
  "When we made the decision to come here, we took a chance. 
We 
knew about the Czechs' great industrial tradition, but we didn't 
know if it had all been lost over the last 40 years," Chilton 
said. 
  The skill and willingness of AVX's Czech work force to solve 
the myriad problems they faced bringing the factory on line 
proved management had made the right decision, he said. 
  "Last June, we had an empty building, and in nine or 10 
months we built it up from zero," Chilton said. 
  "Bringing the factory on line was a daunting task," said 
Peter Collis, production manager for AVX Lanskroun. "Our plans 
were complex and required meeting certain deadlines without 
fail." 
  Collis characterized the modern global electronics industry 
as "a cutthroat business" in which manufacturers vie 
relentlessly to keep a competitive edge while continuing to 
maintain stringent quality control. As a rule, prices for 
components usually degrade by 15 percent each year, forcing 
manufacturers to find new ways to make parts better and more 
cheaply. This is what led AVX to Lanskroun. 
  Tesla Lanskroun had been building tantalum capacitors for 
the 
Eastern market since 1963. AVX hoped to take advantage of both 
the low labor costs and the expertise of the local work force in 
manufacturing these chips. 
  The first AVX representatives visited Tesla Lanskroun in May 
1990. Initially, the company considered a joint venture with 
Tesla, and in June 1992, AVX and Tesla signed a Tantalum 
Assembly Agreement and AVX began leasing floor space from Tesla 
for subcontracting operations. By June 1992, 400 Tesla employees 
were subcontracted over to AVX. 
  Ultimately, AVX rejected a joint venture with Tesla, 
choosing 
instead to start up its own company, AVX Czechoslovakia, which 
was headed by Skala, a former manager at Tesla. 
  "We propose to double our production in the next two years. 
It will increase our market share, but we certainly won't double 
it. The market is growing too fast," said Chilton. 
  AVX Lanskroun currently employs about 1,000 workers. 
  "The factory operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
We're only closed three days a year--Christmas, Boxing Day and 
New Years'. You can't do that in Germany," said Chilton. 
  Other Western high-tech companies may soon follow in AVX's 
footsteps, said Chilton. "For European companies, to use the 
Czech work force is a tremendous opportunity. Our biggest 
problem is learning the Czech language," he said. 
  AVX Czech Republic is a subsidiary of the U.K.-based AVX 
Europe, itself a subsidiary of the American AVX Corp., which is 
in turn a member of the Japanese Kocera Group. The Kocera group 
has some 26,000 employees worldwide and a yearly turnover of $30 
billion (870 billion Kc).
