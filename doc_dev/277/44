<F P=106> [Afrticle by Jaroslav Kmenta: "Iran Wants Tamara, but the </F>
Manufacturer Will Not Sell"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Islamic Republic of Iran has several 
times shown an interest in the Tamara passive radar system, the 
Czech state-of-the-art air defense product that, according to 
the experts, is even capable of detecting the "invisible" U.S. 
Stealth aircraft. This information has been confirmed by Ludek 
Stodulka, vice president of the HTT Group, which manufactures 
Tamara. He emphasized, however, that HTT will not sell it to 
this country. 
  Although Iran is not one of the countries to which arms 
exports are banned, many foreign politicians nevertheless 
consider it to be a very-high-risk region. "We respect the 
state's interest in not supporting the arming of this region," 
added Stodulka. 
  According to him, countries such as India, China, South 
Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand could purchase Tamara. France is 
also interested in it. 
  Tamara and its predecessor, Ramona, have only been exported 
to some of the countries of the former East bloc. At the 
moment, Tamara is also owned by the German Bundeswehr, which 
acquired it from the former GDR National People's Army, and the 
Americans. Apparently, they got it for trials from the Polish 
Army's weaponry. The former Czechoslovakia also sold Tamara to 
Syria. 
  The HTT Group has also developed a civilian version of 
Tamara, said Stodulka. He added that the company could supply 
Tamara, for example, to the police force or the taxi service. 
The radio impulses that the equipment receives from the 
atmosphere could determine precisely the location of vehicles in 
a city. 
  According to Stodulka, Tamara could even be used in the hunt 
for those who kidnap children. If a child were kidnapped along 
with its baby carriage, the radar system could monitor the 
culprit's movements. Stations that could receive and analyze 
the appropriate signals would have to be set up in a city for 
these purposes.
