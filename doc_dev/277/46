  [TEXT] An initial test cable should be ready for use in one 
year--Large-scaled use not for 50 years. 
  After about five years in development, the North American 
company American Superconductor in Westborough, Massachusetts, 
has introduced the prototype of a superconducting high-current 
cable made of high-temperature superconductors (HTSC) and 
measuring one meter [in length]. An initial test cable with a 
total length of about 30 meters should be completed in about one 
year in cooperation with the Italian company Pirelli Cable in 
Milan. 
  This cable will then be able to be used for the first time 
in 
practical tests in power supply companies. It is hoped that in 
two years a one hundred meter long cable will be completed, 
which could then be put into trial operation. The cable 
corresponds approximately to the requirements for smaller power 
supply grids in terms of currents to be carried and the 
resultant magnetic field intensity. 
  The developer reports that a direct current of 2,300 amps 
per 
fiber can be transmitted, which is approximately double the 
value of comparable HT superconductors from other developers. 
The magnetic fields in the order of 0.2 tesla resulting at these 
current intensities are sustained without the superconductor 
breaking at operating temperatures of 77 kelvin. 
  The cable now being introduced consists of oxides of 
bismuth, 
strontium, calcium and copper, which are filled in power form in 
tubes made of silver and then subjected to the required heat and 
acid treatment. Finally the tubes are drawn out to fine 
filaments with a diameter of 200 micrometers using a drawing 
process developed [by the producer]. 
  The test cable is then weaved together by hand from hundreds 
of the fine fibers. The North American superconductor company 
has so far been able to produce a filament of this type with a 
total length of nearly 1,000 meters. 
  In this collaboration, the Italian cable producer took on 
the 
task of putting together the cable with the electric and thermal 
isolation. The cable is to have a hollow space at its center 
through which the liquid nitrogen used for cooling will be 
pumped. 
  Pirelli also intends to develop with an Italian engineering 
company a new machine which can weave the fine filaments 
together automatically. 
  Energy experts estimate that power supply companies will be 
able to install the first shorter lengths of direct current 
cable in ten years at the earliest; however, the behavior of the 
cable will have to be closely monitored for some years before it 
can live up to all the technical and safety requirements. 
  [Experts] are also of the view that it will not be for about 
50 years at the earliest that we can think of replacing the 
high- voltage operated alternating current transmission supply 
lines with superconducting direct current cable, according to 
the American Superconductor Corporation (Westborough, 
Massachusetts 01581, USA).
