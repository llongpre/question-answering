<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Richard Wisdom -- Mercury News; Winter and spring stand in sharp
contrast for bicyclists enjoying a journey Friday along Tesla Road east of
Livermore, with the clouds adding a dramatic effect. Photographers and
sightseers alike were enjoying the vista along the route, which winds through
the hills to link Livermore with Tracy in the San Joaquin Valley. A new storm
is stalling off the coast, making a mostly dry Bay Area weekend likely. Story,
