  [Abstract] Interest in the state of water in biological 
systems under deep cooling and a lack of systematic studies of 
the effect of various types of cryoprotectors on water's 
nonfreezing component in the cells prompted an attempt to 
determine experimentally the quantity of nonfreezing water in a 
suspension of Yersinia pestis EV76 cells in the 
presence of both penetrating and nonpenetrating cryoprotectors 
and study the process of this component congelation with a 
decrease in the specimen temperature. The Y. pestis 
EV76 plague microbe is selected mostly due to the fact that 
preparation of the Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain 
involves freezing in a protective medium and lyophilic drying. 
The Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain of the NIIEG line 
is used in the experiment. The bacteria were grown on a solid 
nutrient medium at a 28ÎC temperature for 48 h. The 
experimental procedure is outlined. Nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectra were recorded by a BS 567 A high resolution Tesla 
spectrometer at a 100 MHz working proton frequency. The 
dependence of the NMR water signal strength on the temperature 
in the suspension of Y. pestis EV76 cells without and 
with a cryoprotector and in a system containing bacterial cells 
and the temperature curves of the cryoptotectant solutions are 
plotted. The dependence of the nonfrozen water NMR signal 
strength on the temperature in the Y. pestis EV76 
bacteria suspensions and in various cryoprotector media and the 
phase transition and congelation temperatures in cryoprotective 
media under various cooling and heating conditions are 
summarized. The study carried out within a 0 to -40ÎC 
temperature range with the help of the differential scanning 
calorimetry method reveals that the total amount of nonfreezing 
water within a range between congelation and melting points in 
cell suspensions with various cryoprotectors does not follow the 
simple additivity law with respect to the sum of hydration 
numbers of individual components. The findings attest to the 
complex effect of multicomponent protective media on the state 
of water's nonfreezing fraction in cell suspensions and point 
toward the possibility of producing material in a congealed 
state. This makes it necessary to determine the waster state at 
low temperatures experimentally in each specific case and in 
developing cryobiological practices, yet the congelation 
temperatures found in the study can be used for selecting 
optimum long-term Y. pestis EV76 cell specimen 
storage temperatures. Figures 2; tables 2; references 10: 8
