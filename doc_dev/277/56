With his broken wrist, rumpled suit and apologetic manner, Frantisek Valabek 
somehow personified the Communist Party for which he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
For Valabek, the problem was personal and immediate, but it spoke volumes about 
the state of affairs within the party. 
</P>
<P>
Standing awkwardly Friday in the press room of the party's Central Committee 
office, Valabek admitted his problem. A visit to the Tesla Hloubetin electric 
appliance factory in suburban Prague that he and a colleague had painstakingly 
arranged for two foreign reporters had just collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The trip had been set up so that the reporters could meet members of the 
People's Militia at the factory, a unit of the party's praetorian guard, which 
is being disarmed. The militiamen were eager to show off their new benign 
image. It fell to Valabek to inform the reporters that others were not so 
eager. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get in," he said. After a long pause he added, "They've taken the 
keys." 
</P>
<P>
Valabek, his eyes on the floor, explained that when members of the party's 
local district committee learned of the visit, they went to the factory and 
stole the keys to the rooms that contained the militia weapons and other gear. 
Not even the once-powerful Central Committee office could pry them loose. 
</P>
<P>
"A visit today will be impossible, I'm afraid," Valabek said. "You need to come 
back next week, after the elections." 
</P>
<P>
Party elections are to take place over the weekend, to choose new committees in 
preparation for the emergency party congress scheduled for Dec. 20-21. The 
party leadership hopes the elections will end the reign of the hard-liners, 
exemplified by the men who took the militia keys. Reform-minded committees 
could be expected to send delegates who are receptive to overhauling the party 
for the democratic age ahead. But the message of Friday's incident at the 
appliance factory is that the road ahead will not be smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing complaints made two days earlier by Karel Urbanek, the party general 
secretary, Valabek said that many regional and district party committees refuse 
to understand that their power is no longer absolute. "It's like a drug," he 
said. "Once you have it, it's hard to give up." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, the chief party spokesman, Jozef Hora, and a Politburo 
member, Vasil Mohorita, had become involved. But the keys were still not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is not possible," Hora said after discussing the situation with 
Mohorita. "Perhaps on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Disarming the People's Militia, which has been one of the most visible symbols 
of party supremacy, has been a traumatic experience for the militiamen. Many 
felt slighted when Urbanek ordered them to turn their weapons in by last Sunday 
in order to reduce the risk of violence in the tense political atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt they couldn't be trusted," Valabek said. "Their pride was damaged." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hora, the party spokesman, the People's Militia has 40,000 to 
50,000 members, all attached to factories and other institutions. The first 
units were formed in 1948, to defend such places against possible attack by 
counterrevolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
As communism itself has come into question, some militia units have voted to 
disband. Party secretary Urbanek announced that the militia will now be used to 
help in large-scale accidents or natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's that much to see anymore," Valabek told the reporters. 
"It's probably just a lot of empty shelves."
