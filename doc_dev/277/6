<F P=106> [Article by "(km)": "HTT, the Manufacturer of Tamara, Is </F>
Developing a More Advanced Passive Radar"] 
  [Text] Prague--Tesla Pardubice HTT, manufacturer of the 
Tamara passive radar, which, according to experts, can reveal 
even the "invisible" U.S. Stealth reconnaissance aircraft, is 
developing a more advanced new-generation passive radar. This 
information has been confirmed by Chief of the General Staff 
Major General Jiri Nekvasil. 
  Representatives from the Pardubice-based enterprise, 
however, 
do not want to divulge anything about this new system, which 
should be called Borap. "We will not discuss the things under 
research; they are taboo," declared Rudolf Barak, president of 
the HTT Group company. Nevertheless, he indicated that special 
enhancements to the current Tamara system are involved. 
  Tamara can reveal aircraft against which current radar 
systems are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS early 
warning system. However, as opposed to active radar systems, 
which emit radio waves and assess their reflection, Tamara only 
receives radio impulses from the atmosphere. 
  So far, the Army has refused to purchase more Tamara systems 
for its arsenal because it is waiting for the completion of the 
more advanced system. The Defense Ministry currently has at its 
disposal one Tamara radar and two of its antecedents, the Ramona 
system.
