<LEADPARA>  The badly burned body of a 14-year-old Livermore girl was found by the side of
a rural road Tuesday, an apparent slaying victim.;    It was the second time
this year the charred body of a woman or girl has been found in the southern
part of Alameda County. The slayings of six girls, whose bodies were found
along rural roads in the area during the 1980s, remain unsolved.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Investigators are trying to determine if the two cases this year are
related, said Alameda County sheriff's Sgt. Dale Toussaint.;    The body of
Jessica Ann McHenry, a freshman at Granada High School in Livermore, was found
about 4 p.m. Tuesday along Tesla Road, which runs through rolling grasslands
south of Livermore.;    Investigators would not release the cause of death or
say if they thought she was killed at the scene or elsewhere. They would not
comment on whether the girl had been killed first and then burned.;    "There
was a very small amount of evidence at the scene," said Sgt. Dal Toussaint.
"There were not gas cans lying around.";    Jessica was last seen by school
friends early Tuesday afternoon, according to the sheriff's department. When
she didn't arrive home after school, her mother reported her to police as a
possible runaway.;    Police are searching for a car seen on the road near the
body, but there is no indication that the car is linked to the crime,
Toussaint said. Sheriff's deputies were setting up roadblocks Wednesday to
search for witnesses.;    The circumstances of Jessica's death are similar to
the slaying of a young woman whose burning body was found in Palomares Canyon,
between Fremont and Castro Valley, in January. It is not clear if flammable
liquid was used to ignite the body in the January case, but a coroner's
investigator reported an "odor of diesel fuel" at the scene. She died from
head injuries from a blunt instrument, the investigator said.;    The woman
found Jan. 27, alongside Palomares Canyon Road, has not been identified,
Toussaint said. A coroner's investigator said the woman was 5 feet 6 and
weighed 91 pounds. Although no age has been determined, she was described as
"young appearing.";    He said there were no apparent connections between the
two burned bodies and the slayings of two women whose dismembered bodies were
found recently in the Oakland area.  </TEXT>
