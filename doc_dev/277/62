Superconductors Capable of Carrying More Load"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Application of the new high temperature 
superconductors (HTSL) still fails in many areas because the 
superconductivity is lost under the influence of comparatively 
weak magnetic fields. When ceramic materials under the influence 
of magnetic fields get a little below a Tesla, they are only 
superconducting at very low temperatures of a few Kelvin. For 
important practical applications superconductivity under 
magnetic fields can therefore only be used with metallic 
superconductors and by cooling with expensive liquid helium. 
  But physicists of the University of Birmingham (School of 
Physics, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom) have now succeeded 
in making the movement of the magnetic field lines in high 
temperature superconductors visible. Consequently, there is now 
an opportunity directly to observe the effect of measures 
against the drifting of the field lines. 
  With this discovery the developers of high-temperature 
superconductors hope to be able to solve the problem in a way 
similar to the comparable behavior for metallic superconductors: 
By doping the material, the field lines are "frozen," which 
makes the construction of high-performance magnets for computer 
tomography possible, for example. 
  The observation and image recording of the magnetic field 
lines in high temperature superconducting materials succeeded 
with a neutron-scattering method in a bismuth, strontium, 
calcium-copper oxide high-temperature superconductor. The 
methods used so far in order to determine the collapse of the 
magnetic field lines were based on indirect measurement 
processes which did not give an image. 
  With the neutron scattering method both the crystalline 
structure and the field line can be recorded. If the 
high-temperature superconductors being studied are under the 
influence of a magnetic field and the temperature is raised from 
a few degrees Kelvin, after a certain point there will be such 
large internal resistances that this causes the crystalline 
structure to be lost. 
  This has the result that the superconducting state is also 
abruptly halted. Because of this phenomenon the British 
physicists speak of a "melting away" of the magnetic flux 
structure (flux lattice melting). In the high temperature 
superconductors available today this will already take place at 
temperatures between four and ten Kelvin. 
  The continued development work by several research groups in 
Europe, the United States and Japan is now aimed at finding ways 
to prevent the "migration" of the magnetic field lines as far as 
the area of critical temperatures between 90 and 100 Kelvin. 
With the "old" metallic superconductors this could only be 
achieved by adding certain compounds. Nevertheless, it took 
almost 10 years before this doping technique had been mastered 
from the aspect of production technology. Whether this will be 
achieved for high-temperature superconductors in a similarly 
long development process, is something no one dares predict. 
  Meanwhile, the development work continues in the United 
States as well. With massive support from the U.S. Department of 
Energy, the development of efficient current limiters for public 
grids from high-temperature superconducting materials is to be 
accelerated. 
  As reported by the authority, a consortium of three 
enterprises and a government research laboratory headed by the 
General Dynamics company (San Diego, California 92186, USA) has 
been awarded almost 5 million dollars for these development 
studies. 
  These funds are to help the company develop operational 
current limiters in two to at most four years. The authority 
expects that by using the new type of current limiters energy 
losses on the order of 100 million dollars a year can be avoided. 
  Current limiters are relay-type switches which keep the 
currents in high-voltage grids within certain ranges. They 
reduce the network current if, for example, lightning strikes or 
if there are short circuits. They protect the power consumers 
against having their equipment damaged by excessively high 
current. 
  By installing superconducting current limiters in 
high-voltage networks, relatively simply constructed and cheap 
power interrupters and simple fuses can be used. The investment 
and operating costs of the supplying enterprises could thus be 
reduced and the production of excess power be avoided. 
  This way the output of the supply networks can take place in 
certain voltage ranges, which leads to considerable savings for 
the power supply companies even at relatively modest cost. 
  The new high temperature superconductors which are being 
used 
for this are not under the influence of magnetic fields at the 
limiter circuits. For that reason, even with the critical 
currents of high temperature superconductors reached today they 
can be used without any further difficulties. 
  Superconducting switching elements have the advantage over 
conventional current limiters that they regulate the supply 
currents with very short switching times, practically unnoticed 
by the consumer, and in this manner provide largely uniform 
currents.
