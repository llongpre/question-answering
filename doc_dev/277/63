<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Tamara Radar Could Monitor </F>
the Situation in the Middle East"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Czech radar, Tamara, which, according 
to the experts, can even detect the "invisible" U.S. Stealth 
aircraft, could participate in monitoring the situation in the 
Middle East. The manufacturer of this state-of-the-art air 
defense system offered it to the United Nations at the beginning 
of the year. 
  According to preliminary conjectures, the Tamara radar could 
be deployed in Cyprus. From this island, which is some 150 
kilometers from the coast of Lebanon, Israel, and other Middle 
Eastern states, the radar could monitor the airspace above this 
region. It could also partially monitor the transfer of 
military hardware on land and sea. Tamara has a range of up to 
450 kilometers. 
  Tamara can detect aircraft against which normal radar 
systems 
are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS [Airborne 
Warning and Control System] early warning system. However, as 
opposed to active radar systems, which emit radio waves into the 
atmosphere and assess their reflections, Tamara only receives 
radio impulses from the atmosphere. 
  Ludek Stodulka, vice president of the HTT Group, which 
produces the radar, told us that Tamara can detect air-defense 
systems and the precise coordinates of missiles, airfields, and 
warning systems. It can differentiate between the false and real 
locations of military hardware. It can distinguish types of 
aircraft, missiles, ships, and radars at great distances. 
  According to Stodulka, the Czech Foreign Ministry has 
described the company's initiative as encouraging. However, the 
appropriate UN offices have not yet responded to the HTT Group's 
offer. In the opinion of Army experts, the deployment of the 
Tamara system would have forestalled such tragedies as the 
shooting down of flight KAL-007 in 1983 by a former Soviet 
fighter bomber or the shooting down of the A-300 passenger 
aircraft by a U.S. Navy missile over the Persian Gulf. 
  Stodulka said that the HTT Group would like to apply to the 
Association for Czech Republic Quality Awards to grant the 
system a Czech Made trademark.
