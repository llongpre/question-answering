A Bosnian Serb leader yesterday signalled plans to push forward with the
creation of Greater Serbia by the end of next year, regardless of punitive
sanctions against Serb-led Yugoslavia.
Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of the Serb parliament, said he expected a
union of self-styled Serb states in Bosnia and Croatia with 'one government,
one parliament'.
The leaders of Bosnia's three warring communities at partition talks in
Geneva have already endorsed the creation of three republics, but Mr
Krajisnik's remarks indicate that, despite their formal agreement, Serb
leaders have no intention of backing the accord.
'Demarcation between national communities in Bosnia will be created soon and
the Bosnian Serb Republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina will create a
common state by the second half of 1994 at the latest,' Mr Krajisnik told
the Serb 'parliament' which met to debate whether to give the negotiating
team a new mandate at talks in Geneva.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has exerted pressure on his Bosnian
proxies to hand over land to their Moslem adversaries in exchange for the
easing of sanctions imposed on Belgrade 19 months ago for its role in the
partition of Bosnia.
Serbian authorities yesterday announced power cuts after coal miners went on
strike demanding their wages in hard currency. The miners at the Kolubara
mining basin on Wednesday stopped all coal deliveries to the Nikola Tesla
thermal power plant, which supplies half of Serbia's electricity. Diplomats
say Serbia still sells electricity to neighbouring countries in exchange for
hard currency.
Printing presses cannot keep up with inflation, which economists yesterday
said ran at 1m per cent in December, according to Belgrade radio.
Buses carrying 800 civilians evacuated from Sarajevo limped across the
Bosnian border into Croatia yesterday, Reuter adds. The buses left the city
on Tuesday after months of haggling between Moslem authorities and besieging
Bosnian Serbs.
