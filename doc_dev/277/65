  [Text] Belgrade, Dec 31 (TANJUG) -- Miners at Serbia's 
biggest coal mine Kolubara on Friday ended a three-day strike 
after negotiating a settlement with the authorities in the night 
between Thursday [30 December] and Friday. 
  Early on Friday afternoon, the Belgrade city transport was 
back to normal after its workers ended their several-hour 
stoppage. Like the workers in Kolubara, they went on strike 
demanding higher wages and better living standards. The strike 
of the 17,000 Kolubara workers in Lazarevac near Belgrade ended 
after the miners on Friday morning verified the agreement 
reached with the republic's electricity board and the government 
on Thursday night. The strikers demanded to receive their wages 
in German marks because of the galopping inflation which hit one 
million percent in December alone. 
  The disturbances in coal deliveries resulted in the 
suspension of operation of the thermal power plant Nikola Tesla 
in Obrenovac, which produces 50 percent of Serbia's overall 
electricity, due to which the Serbian electricity board started 
with several-hour brownouts on Thursday. Although the miners' 
strike has ended, it is not certain whether power supply in 
Serbia will be back to normal on Friday because of the 
disturbances in coal deliveries and electricity production or 
whether some parts of the republic will celebrate New Year's Eve 
in candlelight. 
  Dissatisfied with low wages, workers in the Belgrade city 
transport struck on Friday morning. The Serbian railways has 
been on strike for several days, along with some hospitals and 
gravediggers in Belgrade. A drastic fall in the living 
standards and record-high hyperinflation have been provoked by 
draconic U.N. sanctions introduced against Yugoslavia in late 
May of 1992. 
  Three-fourths of Serbia's industrial facilities have been 
standing still for months, while the remaining one-fourth 
operate at reduced capacities although they are not on strike. 
The average salary in Serbia is below 15 German marks, while 
one kilo of meat sells for 40 marks.
