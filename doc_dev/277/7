<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tesla in the Hands of Eriksson"] </F>
  [Text] After three months of negotiations among the Swedish 
telecommunications company Eriksson, the Croatian Government, 
and the Privatization Fund, the Fund's Board of Directors 
decided at a meeting to accept the Swedish firm's offer to buy 
Tesla. To meet the negotiated price of 70 million German marks 
[DM], the Swedes will pay DM20 million in cash, DM25 million in 
equipment, and hand over patent rights worth DM25 million. 
Eriksson's purchase of Tesla is considered one of the most 
important steps in the privatization process in Croatia in terms 
of the future of its employees rather than purely as a business 
deal. Over a five-year period the work force will be gradually 
reduced from 3,500 to 1,000, after the surplus employees have 
been retrained.
