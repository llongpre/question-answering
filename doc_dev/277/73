<LEADPARA>  A glass of wine, a baguette, live music and a bevy of artists who like to chat
up the observers: What better welcome to the laid-back summer art and wine
season than the 19th annual Art in the Vineyard exhibition in Livermore? The
event -- which attracts thousands each year -- runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Sunday at Wente Bros. Estate Winery.;    "It's always a beautiful day with a
fantastic crowd," said Edmee Acuna Keele, who has chaired the arts festival
for the past six years. She waved her hand around the empty courtyard at the
100-year-old Wente winery last week. "This will be full of wine booths, patio
chairs and umbrellas."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The paintings and sculpture on exhibit were created by 44 members of the
Livermore Art Association. You can watch them create more art before your very
eyes. The artists -- their sun hats anchored in place -- will go into action
with their easels and paints. "We encourage the artists to demonstrate their
work," Keele said.;    That gives the whole enterprise an educational value,
if you need an excuse to wander around in the sun with a souvenir wine glass
in your hand.;    "It's a sharing of knowledge and technique with the public,"
said Margo Kirkewoog, who founded the enterprise 19 years ago, along with Jean
Hawley. "It was a tremendous success right from the beginning.";    Both
Kirkewoog and Keele are prize winners in major shows. "We're the rebels of our
group -- we like to venture out and do less traditional things," said
Kirkewoog, a 22-year artteacher in the Livermore and Pleasanton area. She
paints in all media and has added paper-making to her portfolio.;    Keele, an
engineer/designer for Morton Salt in Newark, does watercolors and collages as
well as mono-prints and etchings.;    Easy listening and jazz entertainment at
Art in the Vineyard will be by Sue Gaughan, the Swing of Things, Pat Hagerty
and Ron Archer.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Art in the Vineyard will be from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Sunday at Wente Bros. Estate Winery, 5565 Tesla Road, Livermore.
Admission of $7 includes a souvenir wine glass and wine tasting. Snacks and
light lunches by Classic Catering will be available at moderate cost. For
information, call Michael Perry at (415) 447-3603.  </TEXT>
