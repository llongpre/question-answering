   Entertainment colossus MCA Inc. today bought
the last big independent music label, Geffen Records, the home of
such strong rock acts as Guns N' Roses, Don Henley, Cher, Aerosmith
and Whitesnake.
   Geffen's sole owner, David Geffen, will receive MCA preferred
stock worth about $550 million at today's share price. He may sell
it only over a four-year period, and thus will benefit if its price
goes up and suffer if it falls.
   He will stay on as chairman and chief executive of Geffen, which
he founded a decade ago in a deal in which Warner Bros. Records
distributed his recordings in return for half the profits. That
deal expires at the end of the year.
   Geffen had been negotiating with Warner, the British Thorn-EMI
and other companies. Geffen Records did about $225 million in
business last year.
   Asked why Geffen selected MCA, MCA President Sid Sheinberg said,
``I would suspect that the difference here is that he's dealing
with people he's known for many years, people with a broad basis in
entertainment, not just music.
   Sheinberg noted that Geffen is known as a brilliant businessman.
   ``I'm flattering myself, but I think he also felt this was a
very good security to own,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   In addition to Geffen's music business, his Geffen Films has
produced movies such as ``Beetlejuice,'' ``Little Shop of Horrors''
and ``Risky Business. Geffen Theatre co-produced ``M. Butterfly,''
which earned nine 1988 Tony Awards, ``Cats,'' ``Dreamgirls'' and
``Little Shop of Horrors.''
   MCA is not buying those businesses. But the Universal City-based
giant will acquire rights to Geffen's related music publishing
business, founded in 1987 as a vehicle for Geffen Records-related
projects. It has since expanded and its stable of songwriters now
includes Stephen Sondheim.
   As part of the deal, Geffen signed a 20-year ``standstill''
agreement that bars him from acquiring more MCA stock or engaging
in proxy wars.
   West Hollywood-based Geffen Records' artists also include Tesla,
Peter Gabriel, Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians, Rickie Lee
Jones, Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, Robbie Robertson, Jimmy Page,
Olivia Newton-John, Kitaro, Ric Ocasek, XTC, Christopher Williams
and Kylie Minogue.
   MCA, unlike other major labels, does not distribute its own
records overseas. Its foreign distribution agreement with Warner
Bros. runs out in March 1991, and Sheinberg said, ``Where we go
from here in the foreign area remains to be determined.''
   He acknowledged, however, that MCA's roster of country and black
artists is far stronger than its list of rock acts.
   ``Having Geffen certainly gives us a stronger package'' while
negotiating, he said.
   Geffen's salary wasn't revealed. The preferred stock he was
issued is the equivalent of 10 million shares of MCA common stock.
Each share paid a dividend of 68 cents last year.
   Geffen, who got his start as a talent agent, was 27 in 1971 when
he founded Asylum Records, the home of Joni Mitchell, the Eagles
and Jackson Browne. Within two years he sold Asylum to Warner
Communications, becoming chairman of Warner's resulting
Elektra-Asylum label.
