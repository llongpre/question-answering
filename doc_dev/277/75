FIFTY FOUR of London Weekend Television's present and former top managers
will split a Pounds 70m share payout next week - their reward for backing
the commercial broadcaster's successful franchise bid in 1991.
Sixteen will become paper millionaires overnight. Another nine will end up
with shareholdings worth Pounds 915,000 apiece.
The 54 will benefit under a share scheme which will give them a collective
holding in the company worth Pounds 70m. The scheme was set up after they
raised Pounds 3m in 1989 to back LWT's successful Pounds 7.58m broadcasting
franchise bid in 1991. It will take effect on Tuesday.
The biggest beneficiary will be Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman: 'The
only thing that has changed as far as I am concerned is that from Tuesday I
will own close to 2 per cent of LWT, but that's all paper.'
Another winner is Mr Melvyn Bragg, LWT's arts controller, novelist and
presenter of The South Bank Show arts programme. His shareholding is likely
to be worth some Pounds 2.9m.
Mr Greg Dyke, LWT's chief executive who once rescued breakfast television
station TV-am's collapsing ratings, stands to gain some Pounds 6.9m. He
said: 'Although this does not in fact take effect until next week what
matters most to me is that from next week I will own 1.5 per cent of LWT,
the company of which I am chief executive and the company where I spend my
working life. This is very exciting.'
LWT's institutional shareholders backed the share scheme in 1989 as a way of
giving the company's top management an incentive to spur them on to win
LWT's franchise bid.
Under the scheme, the 54 will be able to trade their unlisted management and
listed preference shares from Tuesday when they are converted automatically
into ordinary shares.
The scheme's payout has been triggered by LWT's share price staying above
278p for the 20 days since the company reported its half-year financial
results, on July 29.
Today is the last day; the average share price since July 29 has been
470.4p.
According to Mr Peter Coppock, LWT's head of press relations, the 54
managers have signed confidential agreements stating how many shares they
will sell on Tuesday.
The agreement commits them to make no further sales before August 1994.
Sir Christopher anticipated that selling on Tuesday will be minimal,
reducing management share ownership from 15 per cent to about 10 per cent of
the company and making it the third largest group of shareholders.
