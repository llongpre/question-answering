THE BBC'S head of Youth and Entertainment Features, Ms Janet Street-Porter,
is paid as a freelance through her own private company.
Janet Street-Porter Ltd is a company set up principally 'to provide and
promote the services of Miss Janet Street-Porter in broadcast, journalism,
films and television'.
The company had a turnover of Pounds 94,256 last year, according to records
which have been filed at Companies House. This would have included other
freelance earnings apart from her BBC salary.
The company had distribution costs of Pounds 9,775 and administrative
expenses of Pounds 39,364, leaving an operating profit of Pounds 45,117.
For the past four years Ms Street-Porter has been a senior programme
executive at the BBC, but is a freelance on two-year contracts. Last year
she paid corporation tax of Pounds 11,515.
Last night the BBC declined to discuss Ms Street-Porter's payment
arrangements.
Ms Street-Porter said in a statement that she had been 'a freelance for over
20 years, including broadcasting, writing books, journalism, television
presentation and television production'. She added that her last contract
with the BBC ran out at the end of December 1992 and that arrangements for a
new one were still under discussion.
It is apparently not unusual for heads of department at the BBC not to be
members of staff.
Mr Jonathan Powell, who resigned as controller of BBC1 in December, was
never on the staff of the BBC. His successor Mr Alan Yentob always has been.
London Weekend Television confirmed last night that four executives were
paid in part through private companies. They are Mr Marcus Plantin, former
director of programmes who is now ITV's network director; Mr Greg Dyke,
chief executive and also non-executive chairman of GMTV, the breakfast
television company; Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs; and Mr
Brian Tesler, former managing director of the company.
The LWT annual accounts make clear that part of the services of all four is
paid in this way. In each case it is believed the main part of the salaries
are paid to them as employees.
Mr Dyke's company, Vine Productions, had a turnover of Pounds 52,810 in the
year to March 1991 and made a profit of Pounds 32,503.
Payment through a service company in ITV has been less usual in recent years
because of the growth of share option schemes.
The Inland Revenue said that only employees and full-time directors of
companies are eligible for share options. Full-time directors of a company
cannot be executive directors of another company.
Other benefits such as profit-sharing schemes and redundancy pay are also
linked to employee status.
Meanwhile, there was widespread agreement yesterday, before Mr Birt's change
of heart, that his method of payment was untenable for a director-general of
the BBC.
Senior broadcasters who met yesterday to start the organisation of the next
Royal Television Society Cambridge convention saw it as 'extraordinary
behaviour'. They decribed it as a moral issue.
The political reaction to the revelations about Mr Birt's salary was
low-key. The general feeling at across the parties at Westminster was that
it was up to the BBC to determine the details of Mr Birt's remuneration
package.
