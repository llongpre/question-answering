  [Text] The Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL) has 
developed a high-temperature superconducting material that can 
generate magnetic force strong enough to levitate a linear motor 
car. The new material consists of normal conducting material 
inside superconducting material, and it can maintain an 
extremely strong magnetic force of 5 Tesla (unit expressing 
strength of magnetic force) at the temperature of liquid 
nitrogen (-196ÎC). SRL will proceed with application 
research aimed at use of this material in connection with the 
linear motor car. 
  The superconducting magnet being developed by the JR Group 
for the linear motor car must be cooled with liquid helium 
(-269ÎC), but the practicality of the linear motor car would 
be raised significantly if it could be cooled with liquid 
nitrogen. 
  When a magnetic field is applied to SRL's new material while 
in a superconducting state, a "pinning effect" is manifested in 
which the line of magnetic force is captured in the conductive 
material part, which itself becomes a permanent magnet. 
Substance composition and other details will be announced at the 
beginning of 1994, when the patent application has been 
completed. 
  With materials so far, 1.2 Tesla was the maximum magnetic 
force that could be maintained when material was made into a 
permanent magnet. The magnetic force of this new material 
actually was measured at 3 Tesla, but it is said that this can 
be raised to 5 Tesla. 3 Tesla is the level of magnetic force 
needed to replace the metal superconducting magnet for the 
linear motor car being built in Yamanashi Prefecture by the 
Railway Technical Research Institute, and this is the first time 
that barrier has been overcome. 
  Conversion from metal superconducting magnet to 
high-temperature superconducting substance is as easy as 
"changing a tire." Expressing his hopes regarding the new 
material, Railway Technical Research Institute Executive 
Director Masanori Ozeki says, "If we can switch to liquid 
nitrogen cooling, the practicality of the linear motor car and 
operating cost can be improved greatly."
