MR JOHN BIRT, the director-general of the BBC, yesterday backed down and
decided that he would become an employee of the Corporation for the first
time, six years after joining as deputy director-general.
Mr Birt's change of status follows revelations that he had been paid during
his time at the BBC through a private company, John Birt Productions.
After a meeting yesterday with Lord Barnett, the vice-chairman of the BBC
governors, Mr Birt said in a statement: 'The argument has been strongly made
in the past few days that it is inappropriate for the director-generalship
to be occupied by someone who is not an employee of the BBC.
'I recognise the force of that argument. And I have today told the BBC I
would like to accept their offer to change my status and to become a member
of the BBC's staff.'
On Sunday, the BBC was still publicly defending Mr Birt's role as a
'freelance' with his own service company and a senior governor made it clear
no pressure would be brought on Mr Birt from the governors to change his
mind.
The news of Mr Birt's change of heart comes as further information became
available about the private companies of other senior broadcasters, who
have, like Mr Birt, worked or still work at London Weekend Television. Such
arrangements are legal and have been accepted by the Inland Revenue.
Ms Janet Street-Porter, head of youth and entertainment features at the BBC,
has her own private company, Janet Street-Porter Limited. Ms Street-Porter
is not on the staff of the BBC and money from her contract is paid to her
private company. The company had a turnover of Pounds 94,256 last year,
although that would include other freelance earnings.
The BBC refused to discuss the details of Ms Street-Porter's contract last
night. Ms Street-Porter said she had been a freelance for over 20 years
including broadcasting, writing books, journalism, television presentation
and television production. She said her BBC contract ran out at the end of
last year and a new one was being negotiated.
The BBC emphasised yesterday that no other member of the current board of
management, apart from Mr Birt until now, was paid on a freelance basis.
However, Mr Jonathan Powell, until recently controller of BBC 1, was never
on the staff of the BBC.
LWT confirmed yesterday that four executives have been paid in part through
private companies. They are Mr Marcus Plantin, the former director of
programmes who now is director of the ITV network, Mr Greg Dyke, chief
executive of LWT, Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs, and Mr Brian
Tesler, former managing director. Mr Dyke's company, Vine Productions, had a
turnover of Pounds 52,810 in 1991.
The BBC said yesterday that following Mr Birt's appointment as
director-general, the Corporation 'preferred new arrangements for the post
of director-general. These have now been agreed and John Birt will become an
employee of the Corporation'.
It is not clear if Mr Birt will be compensated for the fact that he will not
be paid gross in future and is likely to have to pay more tax. The BBC
refused to discuss details of his new contract.
In his statement, Mr Birt said his particular arrangement had been agreed
with the Inland Revenue. 'I have always been entirely open about the basis
on which my services are provided,' he said.
