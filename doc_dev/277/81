<LEADPARA>  WHEN I GOT married, it was the year of the steak knife. This current wedding
season looks like the Year of the Mini -- the hand-held vacuum, chopper or
mixer.;    There's another trend moving in -- and it's a good one for second
marriages or mature couples who've long since established their own households
and don't need another coffee grinder. The idea is "Don't give it to us, give
it to charity."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE CHARITABLE SIDE OF MARRIAGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     One long-term couple -- whom friends thought would never marry -- recently
issued an invitation that compared their upcoming wedding to other unlikely
events such as "Elvis Found Alive" or "U.S. Balances Budget." They suggested
guests might contribute to the "Good Cause of your choice." (I considered a
contribution in the same spirit to, say, a home for retired circus acrobats,
but chose a charity closer than Florida.);    And when Nancy Sykes and George
Pagan, both of Newark, married on May 4, they asked guests to bring canned
goods for the poor instead of gifts. "We're not teen-agers," Nancy said, "and
we didn't need any wedding gifts. George had gone to a wedding where this was
done and I thought it was a wonderful idea.";    The 380 reception guests at
the Hilton responded with cases of ribbon-tied food, checks and gift
certificates. One brought a picnic basket full of food and champagne with the
instructions, "Give the food to the poor. Save the champagne and the basket
for your first picnic together.";    LOV-Newark volunteers hauled away the
truckloads of food and distributed to Second Chance, the Viola Blythe Service
Center and the Salvation Army.;    George, now retired, worked for the Fremont
and Newark school districts as supervisor of buildings and grounds. Nancy, a
former president of the Washington Hospital Service League, is an active
community volunteer.; (hbox);    TEE OFF: The Tri-Cities Children's Center is
the latest to sponsor fund-raising golf. Its first "Tee Off for Tots"
tournament and dinner will be June 15 at the Sunol Valley Golf Club. Fees of
$125 a person or $400 a foursome go toward child care needs of the homeless
and of teen mothers.;    Working chairwoman of the event is Paula Randall, but
there's a full political-management-labor spectrum of honorary chairs: Alameda
County Supervisor Ed Campbell, United Auto Workers Local 2244 President Tony
DeJesus; New United Motors President Osamu Kimura; and Fremont Councilmen John
Dutra and Gary Mello.;    While they're on a roll, the center announces its
first celebrity roast Aug. 23. "There've been roasts around here for people
who're retiring," notes Tri-Cities Director Paul Miller. But this roast is the
first to feature LIVE POLITICIANS STILL IN OFFICE.;    Subjects of the
multiroast will be Congressman Don Edwards, state Sen. Bill Lockyer and
Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin. Among those applying flames to their toes will
be former Fremont Mayor Gus Morrison, political organizer Mark Stein,
good-works organizer Gigi Stengard and former Fremont Councilman Bob Reeder.;
(hbox);    SALAD-CRAZED: Tri-City residents are descending in ravenous droves
on the salads, soups, pastas and fresh muffins at the NewPark location of the
fast-growing Fresh Choice chain. The Newark restaurant, which opened May 20,
already has a lunch-hour line that stretches out the door. Salad bar (under
$6) includes all the standards, plus such variations as Tex-Mex potato salad,
tabbouleh (the bulgur wheat salad), Chinese chicken salad -- and lots of
specialty dressings. I never figured out what the hickory sauce was for --
there were no ribs in sight. But it seemed to work fine over spinach and for
dunking corn muffins. Fresh fruit and comfort foods like tapioca pudding are
served, too.;    (hbox);    NUN CELEBRATES: Dominican Sister Mary Catherine
Schmidt of Mission San Jose celebrates her 100th birthday today. Not surprised
to learn she says her rosary a lot. But my convent spies also tell me she's "a
serious and fierce opponent in a game of cards."; (hbox);    BEST BETS: Art in
the Vineyard from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today at Wente Bros. Estate Winery, 5565
Tesla Road, Livermore . . . Ohlone College Wind Symphony and Evening Jazz
Ensemble from 1 to 3 p.m. today at the Gazebo, Lake Elizabeth. . . . Mission
Days 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. next Saturday and Sunday at Mission San Jose. Or come
