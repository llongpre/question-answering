FT  01 MAR 93 / Birt expected to keep freelance deal at BBC

MR JOHN BIRT, who became BBC director-general in January, is likely to
continue to be paid as a freelance consultant rather than as an employee,
just as he has since joining the corporation in 1987, it emerged yesterday.
A senior BBC governor said he did not expect there to be any pressure from
the board of governors on Mr Birt to change his status.
Financial details of John Birt Productions, a private company owned by Mr
Birt and his wife Jane, were disclosed yesterday.
Mr Birt's salary from the BBC, believed to be between Pounds 135,000 and
Pounds 140,000 in the year to August 1991, was paid gross to his private
company.
This meant the director-general was able to deduct more than Pounds 30,000
in administrative expenses and pay income tax only on the Pounds 59,000 he
was paid by John Birt Productions.
Mr Birt has not yet signed a contract with the BBC as director-general but a
committee of the board of governors, including Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the
chairman, has already agreed that Mr Birt can be paid in his normal way
through John Birt Productions.
The arrangement is legal and has apparently been accepted by the Inland
Revenue.
The revelation that Mr Birt is not being paid as a full-time employee of the
BBC is, however, likely to be controversial.
It is not unusual in the television industry for entertainers, presenters,
senior reporters, producers and directors to be paid as freelancers. With
the increase in independent production and the growing move to short-term
contracts, this is becoming more common. But it is extremely unusual for
senior executives of the BBC to be paid in such a way. The BBC said
yesterday that no other member of the corporation's board of management was
paid as a freelance consultant. That includes Mr Bob Phillis, who arrives
soon as deputy director-general.
Although there are examples of such practices in ITV - Mr Brian Tesler, the
former chief executive of London Weekend Television, is believed to have had
such a contract - they are still considered unusual at senior executive
level. In the past 10 years, for example, no directors of Thames Television
were paid on such a basis.
At director level, the trend has been the other way. Share options, which
have turned, or are about to turn, many ITV executives into millionaires are
difficult to arrange for those not employed directly. Redundancy money is
also available only to employees.
The BBC said in a statement: 'John Birt has either been a freelance or has
contracted his services through his own company on fixed-term contracts for
over 20 years. The same contractual arrangements that operated when he was
director of programmes at LWT applied when he joined the BBC as deputy
director-general.'
The arrangement means that Mr Birt will almost certainly be paying less
income tax than many of his subordinates.
The Inland Revenue said it would not comment on any individual's tax
affairs, Andrew Jack writes. But it said there was an official in every tax
office charged with determining whether individuals should be permitted to
be registered to pay tax as self-employed.
It is far easier to gain tax deductions under Schedule D, the tax system for
the self-employed, than it is using the pay-as-you-earn system. Many
allowances against tax - such as entertainment - are permitted if they are a
legitimate part of the business.
Under PAYE, by contrast, only items which are 'wholly, necessarily and
exclusively' work-related can be claimed against tax.
