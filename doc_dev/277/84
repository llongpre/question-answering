Philips, the Dutch electronics and electrical group, was one of the foreign
companies which seized the chance to return to Poland when the communist
regime collapsed.
Ending a 43-year break in close relations with Poland, forced by the
nationalisation of the company's operations in 1948, the Dutch group
established its base in the former eastern bloc in mid-1991. The re-entry
came through the purchase of a majority interest in Polam-Pila, a lighting
equipment manufacturer which, like so much of Polish industry, was
floundering for survival at the time of privatisation.
Philips paid Dollars 16m for a 51 per cent stake in the plant at Pila, 320km
north-west of Warsaw, and was granted a further 15.6 per cent interest worth
Dollars 5m in return for raising the plant and its surrounding area to EC
environmental standards. The stake was subsequently boosted to 87 per cent
by the purchase of a 20 per cent slice from employees.
These shares were sold to employees by the state at half the price paid by
Philips. The remaining shares are in the hands of the state treasury.
Philips also won a three-year tax holiday on profits - this runs until
midway through next year - and the right to have a 15 per cent duty waived
on imported machinery and equipment worth up to Fl37m and delivered in
Poland by the end of the year.
The transfer of ownership has bot been without difficulty. The terms were
criticised as being too generous and a short industrial dispute followed the
decision of the Dutch company to freeze wages against employees'
expectations and contrary to the example of several other foreign groups
which entered Poland at the same time.
But with this phase behind it the plant has become Philips's base for
eastern European expansion in the light fittings market. Its proximity to
the former Soviet Union and the associations established there in the
previous two decades are expected to offer it an especially high potential
across eastern frontier.
Mr Stanislaw Kozlowski, the president of the Polish company says that 'the
Russian market is our destiny.' At present 58 per cent of sales are to
export markets. Of this total the US and the UK buy a combined 48 per cent
with the former Soviet Union ranking down the list with other European and
Arab countries. Incandescent lamp fittings, its main product, scores a
significantly higher proportion of export sales than fluorescent fittings
and luminaries.
The Dutch company said earlier this year that its overall Polish operations
returned a net profit of Z75.4bn (Dollars 4.8m)in 1992. The result comes
from sales of Z777.5bn, of which Z647.2bn was generated by the Pila plant.
The plant in Pila was the biggest state-owned producers of lighting
equipment at the time of the takeover but inefficient production and a
mountain of debt had driven it to the wall.
Throughout the last two decades its state-designated function was as a
generator of foreign currency through exports. Heavy local bank loans were
ploughed in to sustain production, with little likelihood of their repayment
after servicing charges. The debt has been reduced dramatically since the
takeover, but interest payments remain a drain on the company.
In order to reach into the international markets during the 1970s and 1980s,
Polam Pila sought to establish ties with world indsutry leaders for the
purchase of equipment and advice. But these overtures were repeatedly
rejected, partly because of a concern that the technology might be passed on
to third parties, especially the then Soviet Union.
Desperate for a much-needed new glass plant, the Poles were forced to turn
to Toshiba of Japan, which completed a Dollars 25m project in 1984. The
Toshiba plant reached contractual standards, but has been virtually scrapped
and replaced with Philips equipment since the takeover, in an important part
of the plan to elevate production efficiency. Mr Kozlowski says that this
decision demonstrates the importance of becoming a part of one of the
world's industry leaders and so share in the latest technology.
Philips's historic ties in Poland, coupled with informal links in the two
previous decades, made the Dutch group a natural potential buyer as the
market in the former eastern bloc became split among the world's leaders.
Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens, is negotiating the purchase of Tesla in what
was formerly Czechoslovakia; and GE bought Tungsram in Hungry. Mr Kozlowski
says that the much bigger GE deal, which has run into significant problems,
has been instructive.
Philips, unlike GE, has not attempted a big, immediate about-face in
management and production techniques; where possible, local management has
been retained - to a point where foreigners have only a token presence in
specialist areas.
