   Before the Berlin Wall opened in a
symbolic breaching of the East-West business barrier, Salamander AG
had produced more than 50 million pairs of shoes for
fashion-starved East Germans and Soviets.
   Volkswagen, maker of some of Europe's best-selling cars, has for
nearly 20 years been fitting Golf and Polo sedans with headlights,
horns and engines made under contract in East Germany.
   From the Bertelsmann publishers supplying book clubs in Dresden
to the Asko department store managers in Bulgaria, Hungary and the
Soviet Union, West German merchants who nursed weak business
prospects through the frosty decades of East-West discord are best
positioned now to exploit opportunities in Eastern Europe.
   ``While many other European and other countries are trying to
get their foot in the door in Eastern Europe, we're already inside,
sitting on the sofa and having tea,'' Jochen Degkwitz, Deutsche
Bank assistant vice president for East European affairs, said in
describing his nation's commanding lead.
   West Germany's boldness primarily has benefited cousin East
Germany, and they seem to be moving toward economic reunification
with stunning speed.
   The West German mark, for example, could soon become the single
national currency, a monetary union that would give Bonn enormous
influence in rebuilding and reshaping the sickly East German
economy.
   West Germany already has the strongest economy in Europe, a
strategic location as the pivotal point between East and West, and
a long history as Eastern Europe's largest Western trading partner.
   When finally calculated, West German trade with the East bloc
for 1989 is expected to exceed the $31.7 billion level recorded the
previous year. It accounted for more than half of all business
volume between Western Europe and the East bloc, but only about 5
percent of West Germany's worldwide total.
   It's difficult to estimate the potential for new business and
industry in a region long locked in the vacuum of socialist
economics. But Eastern Europeans are starving for products ranging
from cars to can openers. Economists say this demand could
eventually translate into enormous profits for investors with the
money and patience to endure a transition that could last a decade.
   Heinrich Vogel, an economist who heads Cologne's Institute for
Eastern and International Studies, contends the consumer needs of
more than 400 million people in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
present international business with its best opportunity.
   ``The potential, in terms of an educated work force with
unsatisfied consumer demands and a broad technology gap, is
tremendous. Everyone is looking for new markets, and where else in
the world do you have a better chance to make money?'' Vogel said.
   Western Europe, which has more than 10 times the volume of trade
with Eastern Europe than either Japan or the United States, could
retain its edge because of proximity and shared history and culture.
   Most of the hundreds of cooperative ventures bringing Western
goods to Eastern buyers are between European partners.
   Philips of the Netherlands, for example, makes videocassette
recorders with Tesla of Czechoslovakia, while Sweden's Volvo sells
vans to East Germany. Austria's Wienerwald restaurant chain has
branched into Hungary, and a handful of Western automakers recently
have announced new projects, including a Volkswagen plant in
Karl-Marx-Stadt and a Renault venture in Czechoslovakia.
   Replacing costly imports with home-produced goods is the primary
aim of East Europeans, said Gerd Adomeit, East European trade
specialist with West Germany's Industry and Trade Council.
   ``We will contribute to their reconstruction mainly by
cooperation in joint ventures and by providing technology,
management skills and marketing skills to sell products in the
West,'' Adomeit said. ``However, import substitution is more
important to East Europeans now.''
   Many West German businesses, sensing what was needed long ago,
have been engrossed in efforts to help modernize Eastern Europe's
crumbling infrastructure. Some are expected to do quite well in
projects ranging from communications to power generation.
   Stock prices have shot up for firms like Siemens electronics, a
likely candidate to revamp the East bloc's woeful telephone
network. Upgrading of industrial plants will draw on the technical
know-how of Thyssen, Hoesch and Preussag, and Daimler-Benz's
transport expertise is in demand for the region's daunting rail
electrification needs.
   Most pressing and therefore most promising is the field of
environmental cleanup, as Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia
vie for the dishonor of the continent's most polluted state.
   West Germany has pledged more than $1 billion to 17 East German
cleanup projects. Asea Brown Boveri of Switzerland will be
producing steam turbines and other power plant equipment with
Poland's Zamech firm in one of the first projects aimed at
environmental improvement.
   Much of the West European interest in entering cooperative
projects with the East is stifled by indecision and inconsistency
in the laws regulating foreign investment.
   Some countries have yet to adopt clearly defined rules for joint
ventures and repatriation of profits by foreign companies, for
example. Even investments in tourism, considered an easy and quick
way to lure foreigners and their money, are hampered by poor
transportation and unmotivated workers.
   ``People who think they can come in and make a quick buck are
going to be very disappointed,'' said Eddy Buehlmann, senior vice
president for American Express Travel Related Services for Europe,
Africa and the Middle East.
   ``Service with a smile, or service with sentiment, as we say at
American Express, doesn't exist in Eastern Europe,'' Buehlmann said.
