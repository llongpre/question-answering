<LEADPARA>  JUST ABOUT the only law in the country seeking to protect workers who use VDTs
was attacked last week by two companies who filed suit to overturn the city
ordinance passed late last year in San Francisco.;   The companies, Zack
Electronics and Data Processing and Accounting Services, allege in their suit
that only the state of California, not individual cities or counties, has the
right to pass laws governing worker safety. They complain that the ordinance,
whose first major requirement takes force in January, is not only
unconstitutional but will cost them money and put them at a competitive
disadvantage with businesses in other parts of the state.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I only wish it were a simple matter of greed at work here. It's not unusual
for companies to consider their workers' health long after the health of their
bottom lines.;   But cost is not the real issue. Unfortunately for workers,
the VDT law appears to have become a convenient target in a much larger fight
between the city's business community and the supposedly "anti-business"
administration of San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos.;   The San Francisco
ordinance is clearly designed not to punish business but to provide the bare
minimum of protection to workers who use VDTs. It mandates proper furniture,
adjustable computer equipment and regular work breaks, all of which have been
demonstrated to cut down on the crippling injuries that are beginning to
plague regular computer users. It was even watered down at the last minute by
the business lobby so employers have four years before they must be in full
compliance, starting in January with the requirement that all new VDT
equipment they buy conform to the specifications in the ordinance.;   YET,
WHILE the two companies decry the cost of complying with the city ordinance,
both also say they would not object to the cost if an identical state law were
passed.;   "I'd (comply) in a minute," says Data Processing's owner, Bob
Tesler. "Healthy, happy workers are more productive for us.";   The motive,
instead, seems to be to stick it to City Hall.;   "The City and County of San
Francisco has no expertise in these matters. They drew up work-station (rules)
based on a lack of knowledge," says Michael LaPorte, CEO of Zack. "I would
trust an expert body like Cal-OSHA before I trust the Board of Supervisors."; 
 Who has the better expertise is certainly debatable. So is the issue of which
body would produce a law that was less motivated by politics and more by
concern for workers.;   What is clear is that this vital health and safety
issue has not been addressed at the state level, or anywhere else, for that
matter.;   WHILE some state VDT safety legislation was proposed in Sacramento
earlier this year, according to San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Elaine
Warren, it never got anywhere in a lawmaking body obsessed with interminable
political fights over the state budget and reapportionment.;   "The
combination of not getting anything out at the state level and the beginning
of implementation of the San Francisco law is probably the reason this suit
was filed now," she says.;   No doubt some businesses, faced with any
worker-safety regulation that might cost them money, will flee for the more
hospitable confines of "pro-business" states, where, say, chicken-processing
plants can padlock their fire doors. Others, I'm sure, genuinely want a single
state law that will keep the competitive field level.;   Perhaps, someday, the
state will get around to passing such laws. But the problems associated with
regular VDT use are well-demonstrated, and the health of users will suffer
only as long as protections are voluntary. At least San Francisco is doing its
part, and the law deserves to remain intact.  </TEXT>
