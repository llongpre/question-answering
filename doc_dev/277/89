<F P=106> [Article by Josef Stetka: "The Transformation of the Czech </F>
Republic Army"] 
  [Text] At his first meeting with rehabilitated soldiers, 
Defense Minister Baudys expressed his regret that the Army does 
not have enough money to retain the younger command personnel. I 
contradicted the minister and said that there is enough money, 
but that it is not being utilized purposefully. I was not alone 
in making this argument, so the minister was given a few 
specific examples, not only from the Defense Ministry, but also 
from the General Staff and the former Western Military Circuit 
[ZVO]. It is to his credit that he stopped squandering more pay 
on a gentleman (or rather, comrade) who was discharged from the 
Army despite stiff resistance from Mr. Pezl [former chief of the 
General Staff], resistance motivated by the fact that he was an 
"irreplaceable expert" (it could not be otherwise; after all, he 
was one of the main organizers of the Zasah and Vlna 
operations). Mr. Pezl expressed his opinion of this "expert" in 
an interview with editor Grunthalova in TELEGRAF. This comrade 
had duties pertaining to a senior officer, duties that in the 
Army correspond to the rank of captain, but he received the same 
pay as a deputy chief of the General Staff. It is not difficult 
to work out who was responsible for this. 
<H5>  A Mere 240 Million Korunas </H5>
  The minister's response to other disclosures, however, was 
not so unequivocal. The objection that new defense systems 
compatible with those of NATO are not being purchased for the 
Army, but personal Mercedes Benz cars are, was resolved by the 
cars being put in the garage for three months. However, they 
are now once more cruising along our highways. The minister 
also did not respond to the revelation that the former commander 
of Armaments and Technical Procurement should have been 
responsible for drawing on the authorized budgeted resources for 
the ZVO ("Our proposals were not taken into consideration in the 
1992 exercise year and, consequently, we consider an evaluation 
to be unnecessary bureaucracy"). The issue here involved a 
"mere" 240 million korunas and, so that the red tape did not 
grip too tight, all the documents were shredded before 9 
February 1993. This may be why this enemy of bureaucracy was 
appointed ZVO commander. 
<H5>  Distinguishable Oil? </H5>
  The retirement of various generals and administration 
commanders is another example of "purposefully" expended funds. 
I will cite one case for all of them. When General Barak 
retired, he kept for three whole months--when General Barta was 
already in office as his successor--his staff car and a 
secretary and used all the means of communication in the 
administration. That was mainly so he could increase his 
business activity and so that Tesla Pardubice would not cost him 
so much. You would think that someone would go back and review 
his business trips and find out who had authorized them? Why 
should we bother about such petty details since, after all, the 
Army does not care about them. 
  I would also like to mention that the retiring communist 
generals purchased from the defunct Warsaw Pact all the supplies 
of fuels, aircraft fuel, and lubricants stockpiled in our 
military stores--for peanuts. Did Czechoslovakia, as one of the 
members of this disintegrating organization, receive an 
appropriate amount for these bargain-basement fuels? However, 
since none of our government protagonists--including the prime 
minister--is familiar with dirty money, it is impossible to 
ascertain for what purpose these supplies were purchased. It is 
possible to ascertain, however, that they were sold not only to 
civilian enterprises, but also back to our Army. It should be 
easy to distinguish the 100,000 hectoliters of Warsaw Pact 
aircraft petroleum from the 100,000 hectoliters of CSFR Army 
aircraft fuel stored in the same tanks--or am I mistaken? 
<H5>  What Was Left by the Soviet Army </H5>
  It is unnecessary to say too much about the selling of 
military exercise areas [VVP] for ludicrous sums or even just 
for write-offs. However, at least something will act as an 
illustration: The deputy commander of the Military Housing 
Administration has carried out such economic regroupments that 
even U.S. managers may envy him. Did the commander of the 
administration or the chief of the General Staff know about 
this? Buildings vacated by the former Soviet Army in VVP 
Milovice were sold to Colonel Zbytek (by the way, he is the one 
who became famous at the United Agricultural Cooperative 
Congress in December 1989 for his demand to use force against 
those subverting socialism in the CSSR) for more than 140 
million korunas, although it says unequivocally in the 
agreements on the withdrawal of Soviet troops that all the real 
estate must be offered first to the Czechoslovak state. It is 
no longer necessary to mention his cooperation with former 
Defense Minister Vacek in the Ralsko Free Trade Zone. He was 
promoted to the rank of general for his "services" to the state 
and, when he retired, he was given a better appraisal by the 
supreme commander than any of those who fought in foreign armies 
in World War II. Or, the sale of the exercise ground in Karlovy 
Vary, where Colonel Salek--otherwise commander of the Regional 
Military Administration in Karlovy Vary--and his son 
distinguished themselves by managing to appreciate the value of 
one square meter by around 500 percent the next day. How much 
did they make, given that it was 100 hectares (of course, it was 
not to the Army's benefit)? Who gave them the go-ahead for 
this? The ministry's inspection team, led by Colonel Silhan, 
did not find anything suspicious about this deal. I do not know 
of any case that would have been submitted to the Prosecutor's 
Office for investigation--or, God forbid, for 
prosecution--during the time that this commander and Minister 
Dobrovsky were in office. Why be petty, the new budget will 
take care of it. 
<H5>  Incompatible Computers </H5>
  There are about 1,000 senior officers and civilian personnel 
in the General Staff, but there are also more than 1,000 
personal and other computers there that were purchased in an 
uncoordinated manner (let us exclude the intention) by various 
administrations, commanders, and so on. Of course, no one is 
capable of putting together a network from these 
computers--which, with a few exceptions, are incompatible--to 
handle not only command, but also communications logistics for 
the General Staff. Thus, the computers have been downgraded to 
luxury typewriters worth a cool 50,000 to 100,000 korunas each. 
I pointed this out to Mr. Pezl at the meeting with 
rehabilitated officers. But to no avail. In fact, the upshot 
is that last year--that is, 1993--incompatible computers were 
again purchased in an uncoordinated manner for millions of 
korunas. I will not publish the exact sum so that I am not 
suspected of revealing a military secret, if such economic 
management is a military secret. A novice economist may perhaps 
be able to work it out. 
  Apart from this computer shambles, there are X number of 
modems (the commander of the Communications Administration can 
supply the precise number) in the General Staff, which enable 
their addressees to have fax links from their workplaces in the 
General Staff to their apartments, businesses, and--of 
course--anywhere else. Why observe military secrecy when a 
classified or even a strictly classified document can be sent 
anywhere by modem, even to the KGB, for instance. However, I 
breathed a sigh of relief. I found out that the KGB has been 
abolished. 
<H5>  Illogical Logistics </H5>
  Support units were turned into "logistics" in the name of 
transformation, although no one there behaves logically. 
Instead of reducing the number of colonels and 
lieutenant-colonels and increasing that of the non-commissioned 
officer and warrant officer, they have begun to equip the 
offices with new furniture and carpets, including these 
computers. Illogically, not one new defense system has been 
purchased and technical equipment for the Military Police has 
been shelved so that it cannot point out this illogicality--or 
anything else. The gentlemen at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff are acting like Marshall Russworth in the 
Emperor's Baker--they are buying trinkets and 
feathers for their overgrown administrations and departments. 
If they think this is the correct way to transform the Army, 
they are certainly quite mistaken. We can imagine how they 
contribute to the Army's credit in the eyes of the taxpayers. 
Probably they do not; otherwise they would not run things like 
this. 
<H5>  Impatient NATO </H5>
  I am aware of how NATO is burning with impatience to take us 
into its bosom. An Army that does not know that, if it retains 
an intolerable number of senior officers and does not transfer 
funds to the lower command levels, it cannot undergo any 
transformation, an Army without compatible defense systems, an 
Army that cannot stick to its annual budget and must survive to 
the detriment of the following year? An Army in which to this 
day there are more than 2,000 former political staff, more than 
half of whom work in the units and offices dealing with the 
training of young people? An Army in which a "university" 
education obtained at the Vokovice Sorbonne or at another 
Marxist-Leninist-type political college of a similar level is 
enough for the rank of colonel? An Army in which not one KGB 
agent has been uncovered and that applied to communist generals 
to draw up its transformation plan? This transformation plan is 
a mockery of a defense doctrine, including the one whose author 
is, allegedly, a former chief of the General Staff. An Army 
whose senior command is--according to a recent statement by the 
defense minister--made up of traitors, because anyone who after 
1968 agreed with the Soviet aggression is a traitor. Mr. 
Minister, these are not my words, they are your evaluation! You 
should draw conclusions from your own statements! 
<H5>  The West and Russia </H5>
  In 1938 we had one of the better equipped and trained armies 
in Europe, an army that could have been one of the decisive 
factors in the clash with the "brown plague." Despite this, our 
allies did not include us in the anti-Hitler coalition and 
peddled us in return for a dubious attempt at preserving the 
peace for their own countries. To think that we would be more 
attractive for them today is an unforgivable error. Everyone 
knows how the elections in Russia have turned out, and I do not 
just mean Zhirinovskiy. The "democrats" Yeltsin and Kozyrev 
speak just as unequivocally. If the West again needs to make a 
concession to preserve the peace for its countries, a new Yalta 
will be formulated and we will be surrendered to another 
plague--a red one. We recently learned that we should not 
submit our request for admission into NATO in Brussels, but in 
Moscow. Obviously, will be able to tell the next day whether 
Partnership for Peace prevents it. 
<H5>  The Tradition of the Minister's Advisers </H5>
  It has become one of the traditions of our "post-revolution" 
Army that a retiring senior Army functionary acts as an adviser 
to the new defense minister. Obviously, he is supposed to 
advise him in such a way that it can be passed on that it was 
not like this under us. Mr. Vacek was an adviser to Mr. 
Dobrovsky and, during this period, he got better at tennis and 
swimming and even managed to write his first socialist literary 
work--Why I Should Keep Silent. Why would he prefer not to keep 
silent? He could still be giving advice today. The minister's 
current adviser is Mr. Pezl. What is he advising him? How, at 
a time of dire peace, to acquire four general's stars in just 
under three years? On the basis of a query made in the Military 
Historical Institute, this is a completely unknown phenomenon in 
the history of the modern military. Perhaps it was necessary to 
increase the Army's prestige in the eyes of the civilian 
population. Or, how to maintain the highest possible number of 
protagonists of the former regime in senior posts, including 
those who took part in the Zasah and Vlna operations? I would 
add the Order of Victorious February to his last general's star 
for saving those who shared the same ideals as him. Mr. Pezl 
often blamed shortcomings on the communists' 40-year reign. Has 
he forgotten that he himself played no small role in this 
government--before 1968 and again after 1989? It is not, 
General Pezl, just the 40 years of communist government; you 
have to add to this the three years when you were chief of the 
General Staff. You did not resign from the party of the 
Bolsheviks, you had to be expelled from it; otherwise you would 
probably still be there today. Or, perhaps you are advising the 
minister how to discharge the senior officers faced with 
screenings and to give them 3,800 korunas per month until they 
reach retirement age--and then hire them again at the Defense 
Ministry or the General Staff and place them on the 11th pay 
scale as civilian employees, who are not subject to screening? 
<H5>  How To Make Money Privately on the Ministry's Budget </H5>
  In every normally managed entity, an order is placed with an 
enterprise that is able to do the requested work or to fill the 
order. The work is invoiced after it is completed or partly 
completed. Invoicing before completion is only done in 
exceptional cases, for example, in filling foreign orders and so 
on. Why are things different at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff? I can cite the specific example of how a former 
senior officer gets together with four other people, amasses 
100,000 korunas, and registers a shareholding company--the 
officer places an order with it for the Army worth 1 million 
korunas for delivery and assembly. The newly established 
shareholding company buys materials from this million korunas 
and invoices them with the work for the Army. A profit is 
guaranteed and is divided. How? In a legal procedure, the 
shareholding company would have to borrow money, for example, 
from a bank and pay the interest out of its profits. I do not 
believe that it would be too difficult to find out in how many 
cases business was conducted this way in the Army. 
<H5>  One Should Respond to the Criticism, Not to the Critic </H5>
  This does not make pleasant reading, and I will certainly be 
attacked for criticizing too harshly. Unfortunately, this is 
far from everything, it is merely the acclaimed tip of the 
iceberg. First of all, it should be ascertained whether it is 
really the truth, and only then should action be taken. I am 
not writing this to discredit the Army, but as proof of why I 
have no faith in how the Soviet-type army is being transformed 
into an army that could be admitted into NATO. 
  When Mr. Baudys came into the Army, he issued such 
statements 
that I came to believe in him. But when the year was over and 
reality did not match up to his statements, I began to have my 
doubts. I now know that I am unable to change or correct 
anything myself, but I cannot let it pass without comment. I 
have never been in favor of across-the-board solutions, but I am 
also not in favor of a thick line under the past. After all, 
there is a considerable difference between an employee in the 
political apparatus who distributed newspapers and the behavior 
of a hardened ideologue paid not for his military knowledge, but 
for his party work in the irreconcilable class struggle. I 
think, Mr. Minister, that you have squandered the opportunity to 
set down this difference in the recent assessments of the corps 
of commanders. Just as you squandered the approval of the law 
on the illegality of the communist regime. 
<H5>  And What Does the Parliament Have To Say? </H5>
  I would like to address my final appeal to another 
institution, which in fact is most responsible for the twists 
and turns of this whole transformation process, even though it 
does not want or know how to acknowledge this. I cannot 
understand, given the number of critical articles concerning the 
Army lobby, why our parliament's Defense and Security Committee 
has still not dealt with these issues. It is impossible to 
leave the Army--one of society's power-wielding elements--to 
self-control and self-regulation. Why in other armies do the 
inspector generals enjoy the support and even respect of 
parliament, the government, and the supreme commanders, while in 
our country--where the Army is tossed about by its ideological 
heritage and by corruption of unknown proportions--the attitude 
of a "dead beetle" is adopted? 
When I said in OBRANA LIDU in 1991 that the post of inspector 
general is essential for the Army, I was considered to be a 
simple idealist: Come on, man, the Army will be democratized, 
why the supervision? The facts show that this issue has been 
severely underestimated and if it is again left to the 
discretion of Army officials, in the next two or three years we 
will have to scrape together several more tens of billions of 
korunas to put right what we neglected now. With all due 
respect for the high IQ of the possible candidate from the 
Christian Democratic Party, Vaclav Benda, I think that the 
bargaining among the parties for a functionary for this post has 
to proceed from more than party criteria. 
<H5>  We Need an Army Inspector General </H5>
  I do not know if Mr. Tigrid's appointment as a minister was 
merely a campaign move by the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party or indeed a glimmer of better 
times, but I pray that he was not the exception that confirms 
the rule. He has assumed a great deal of responsibility, and I 
hope that he proves that we do not just have "personalities" in 
the political parties. 
  Esteemed deputies, I am turning to you, to the 
representatives of those who want to again believe that the army 
is protecting them and that their money will not be frittered 
away, but really used for what it was intended. Do you think 
that when you leave the Army to self-maintenance and 
self-regulation you are doing your voters a service? Certainly 
not. I am asking you to draft a law on an inspector general, 
without unnecessary procrastination. 
  We all know that now, after the offer of Partnership for 
Peace from the West, the Defense Ministry along with the Foreign 
Ministry has to submit to our future alliance partners our 
concept for this partnership. Do you think that generals reared 
by the Warsaw Pact's military doctrine have the best concept for 
this partnership? Minister Zieleniec gave the best answer to 
this question in Sunday's Arena program when he said that there 
has to be civilian supervision of the Army. Under the current 
legal arrangement, I cannot imagine anything other than 
parliamentary supervision.
