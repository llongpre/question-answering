Republic"] 
  [Text] Prague/Paris--At the beginning of June, military 
exercises will be conducted with a French company in the Czech 
Republic and at the same time a Czech company in France. It is 
also expected that French experts will be commissioned to Czech 
military schools. That is one of the results of the three-day 
visit by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys to France. The 
delegation also met with the representatives of a leading 
electronic concern, Thomson-CSF, that was seriously interested 
in Pardubice Tesla once. Minister Baudys admitted the 
possibility of cooperation with this firm in the development of 
the electronic equipment for the Czech light multipurpose L-159 
aircraft currently in the works, the modernization of air 
defense, and the T-72 tank. After the talks, Baudys confirmed 
that the Czech Republic enjoys great credibility in the 
industrial world. This fact, according to him, makes it 
possible for the Republic in the modernization of the Army not 
to purchase only finished products but rather opt for supplies 
of state-of-the-art technology and utilize the capacity and 
possibilities of the Czech firms.
