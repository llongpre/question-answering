<F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta report: "Iran Has Apparently Manifested an </F>
Interest in Products From Czech Arms Factories"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Representatives from Skoda Plzen, which 
is part of the RDP Group arms consortium, held talks during 
their visit to Iran in autumn with officials from the Iranian 
Army at the country's Defense Ministry. A diplomatic source 
informed MLADA FRONTA DNES of this yesterday. He added that 
this was supposed to have been an informative meeting concerning 
possible cooperation in the arms industry. 
  Skoda Director General Lubomir Soudek has not denied this 
report; at the same time, however, he has not confirmed it. "I 
am not saying yes or no. I do not think it is anyone's business 
what the talks were about, how extensive they were, or with whom 
they were held. When the talks assume a specific form, we will 
proceed in accordance with the laws," he said. 
  The Iranian regime is described by some countries -- for 
example, by Israel -- as a terrorist regime. 
  Lubomir Soudek denied contacting the Iranians to offer them 
surface-to-air missiles or the Tamara passive radar system. 
  According to the most recent issue of the weekly RESPEKT, 
there exists an internal memorandum by Lubomir Soudek from the 
trip to Iran in which he writes about a meeting at the Defense 
Ministry and about talks with the army. 
  According to this document, the Skoda director was, for 
example, supposed to have briefed Iranian Deputy Defense 
Minister Vaheed on the RDP Group, the Czech company involved in 
the production and sale of weapons. The Iranians were supposed 
to have shown an interest in the new generation of 
surface-to-air missiles, the Tamara radar system, and modernized 
tanks. 
  Soudek has confirmed that a memorandum from his visit to 
Iran 
exists; nevertheless, he said that it is not available to 
reporters. The Skoda director told us the following in 
connection with the talks on the Russian T-72 tank, in whose 
modernization the plant will participate: "So far, we have not 
modernized a single tank; we have nothing to offer. However, if 
Iran is on the list of countries to which the export of special 
materials is prohibited, of course, we will not consider 
exporting there." 
  The Foreign Ministry, according to our source, will ask 
Lubomir Soudek for an official report on his company's 
activities. Czech diplomats do not know anything about 
representatives from Skoda Plzen holding talks with army 
officials in Iran. According to our source, the ambassador of 
the Czech Republic to Iran was only informed of the Skoda 
delegation's visit to the Agriculture and Energy Ministries. 
  "If Skoda Plzen negotiated in Iran as it was alleged to have 
done, then after 1 March -- when the law on arms trading should 
come into force -- it would be possible to regard such activity 
as an offense," said our diplomatic source, without giving any 
details. 
  Lubomir Soudek has emphasized that he held talks in Iran on 
-- for example -- plans for a joint enterprise in the sugar 
refining industry and on the founding of a company to 
manufacture Skoda trolley buses for the Teheran public 
transportation system. "If some people want to turn the 
business trip into a scandal, then they should not be surprised 
if the number of unemployed increases," declared Soudek.
