  [Text] Prague, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
has neither been informed about Skoda heavy engineering company 
General Director Lubomir Soudek's negotiations in Iran last 
November nor has it been approached by anyone from the Iranian 
side, ministry spokeswoman Lucie Pilipova told CTK today. 
  The latest issue of the Czech political weekly RESPEKT 
reported that during the visit to Iran, the delegation from the 
Plzen, west Bohemia-based Skoda company led by Soudek negotiated 
with the Iranian Defense Ministry and Army representatives on 
the possibility of supplying Iran with weapons and military 
systems. The weekly said that representatives from the Czech 
Foreign Ministry had also been present at the talks. 
  Pilipova declined to comment on the published article or on 
other reports on the topic that have appeared in the Czech media 
recently. 
  Neither has a spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Prague 
commented on the article, citing a statement issued by his 
embassy in December. At that time Iranian Ambassador in Prague 
Rasul Movahedijan distanced himself from the information on his 
country's alleged efforts to obtain nuclear technology from the 
Czech Skoda company. At the same time he spoke in favor of 
closer contacts with the company, emphasizing that this 
cooperation was directed solely towards peaceful projects. 
  Skoda representatives admitted in December that Soudek had 
negotiated on the possible nuclear project -- the construction 
of a nuclear power plant -- during his November visit to 
Teheran, but added that no agreement was concluded. 
  Israeli Ambassador to the Czech Republic Moshe Yegar, in an 
interview with CTK in December, voiced the view that any 
supplies for nuclear energy projects to Iran were 
extraordinarily dangerous and voiced doubts about Iran's 
sincerity in connection with the presentation of its nuclear 
program as solely peaceful one. 
  RESPEKT wrote that during the November talks with Skoda 
representatives, not only were supplies for nuclear energy 
projects discussed, but Iran also showed interest in Czech 
supplies of "special technology" -- ground-to-air missiles, 
modernized T-72 tanks, and the Tamara detection system, which 
can track aircraft equipped with special anti-radar devices.
