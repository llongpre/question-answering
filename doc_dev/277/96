   Six months after Soviet tanks
began rolling out, the Rolling Stones have rolled in, marking a
high point for the new cultural freedom long denied by the
country's ousted Communist rulers.
   The band plays for the first time in Czehoslovakia today at
Prague's Strahov Stadium, listed in the Guiness Book of World
Records as the world's largest, with a capacity for 240,000 people.
   ``It's a great opportunity for us to play to people who could
never hear us before,'' Keith Richards, the band's lead guitarist
said in a documentary aired Thursday on state television.
   Proceeds of the concert will go to the Czechoslovak Children's
Foundation, which benefits handicapped children, Romanian refugees
and victims of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, according to
media reports in London. The charity is headed by Olga Havel, wife
of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel.
   Unused for the last five years, the stadium was given a new coat
of paint before technicians started assembling the mammoth sound
system and elaborate stage for the Rolling Stones concert.
   Close to 100,000 thousand people are expected to enjoy
``Sympathy For The Devil,'' ``Jumping Jack Flash'' and other hits
from the band's 25-year-long career, rarely heard publicly in
Czechoslovakia under Communist rule.
   On Feb. 26 Soviet tanks began leaving Czechoslovakia, ending two
decades of military occupation and sealing the fate of
Czehoslovakia's hard-line Communist rulers, ousted in a popular
revolution late last year.
   And on Aug. 12, the first truck of The Rolling Stones world tour
started rolling into Prague, marking the new winds of
liberalization after forty years of Communist rule and
state-decreed culture.
   The impact of the Stones' arrival has been dramatic in Prague,
where over the years fans have had to buy the band's albums at
inflated prices on the black market.
   ``It's a dream come true, something I never hoped to see in my
life,'' said Ivan Kadanka, a 43-year-old drummer, whose band will
perform as a support act to the Rolling Stones show. ``It's a
unique experience, something I am going to tell my children and
grandchildren about.''
   If the emotional content of the performance is overwhelming for
musicians, the sheer size of the show exceeds the imagination of
Czech promoters.
   ``When we started talking about it in May, we were six people
who put together $400 of capital, and started daydreaming about a
show that costs $1.5 million to produce,'' said Milan Pesik of Mars
Productions, a promotion group.
   Pesik said the Stones thought the promotion group was ``a bunch
of phonies who wanted to have fun at the band's expense.'' It was
only the invitation of President Havel that got things moving, he
said.
   Soon an unprecedented publicity campaign was unleashed in the
country's media, a stranger to the hype of big-time show business.
   ``Hi, I'm Mick Jagger. The Stones are rolling into Prague,'' the
band's singer and leader said in Czech to millions of TV viewers
for two weeks, several times a day. That message established Jagger
as a household name in a country that in the past had virtually
banned rock music.
   A gigantic red tongue in a huge mouth _ the Stones's traditional
logo _ appeared atop a hill where a statue of Soviet dictator
Joseph Stalin once stood. The hill, the summit of which is called
Letna Plain, looks out over the city center.
   A video screening of the show on the American leg of the show
was held on Prague's Old Town Square Monday and attracted about
10,000 viewers.
   Supraphon, the state record company and Bonton, its newly born
private competitor, released the band's latest album, ``Steel
Wheels,'' on unusually short notice in a country where world hits
usually reach the charts years after their popularity has faded in
the West.
   But for some, the Stones concert has a particular meaning at a
time Czechoslovakia struggles to implement market and democratic
reforms.
   ``The important thing I see in an event like this is not only
... the fun and razzle dazzle,'' said Cenek Petak, a veteran
saxophone player. ``It's a way of showing the people that it takes
years to become that good. It takes tradition, positive attitude
and lots of hard work.
   ``It's something you cannot achieve overnight by waving a magic
wand, and that I think is a message this country should hear right
now,'' Petak said.
