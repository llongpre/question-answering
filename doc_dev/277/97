<F P=106> [CTK report in the "From the Political Scene" column: "Milan </F>
Adam Elected Chairman of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party"] 
  [Text] Pardubice -- Milan Adam, 66, former minister of 
education in the post-November 1989 government, was elected 
chairman of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party [CSS] at the 27th 
CSS Congress in Pardubice. The participants in the congress 
also approved party statutes and the program of this 
extraparliamentary party. In the adopted documents, the 
Socialists have subscribed to the traditions of the CSS since 
1897 when the CSS' predecessor "was born of the will of 
nationally and socially minded workers." 
  However, the status of legal successor to the pre-November 
CSS was also claimed by Hirs' Liberal National Social Party 
[LSNS] when it was founded in May 1993. Unlike the present CSS, 
the LSNS emphasizes the tradition of Benes' National Social 
Party.
