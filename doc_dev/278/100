<LEADPARA>  Forget pepperoni and cheese -- the pizza of the 90s will be topped with
everything from cactus to sauerkraut.;    Shakey's Pizza has fired up a test
kitchen in the company's South San Francisco headquarters and is trying out
all manner of concoctions to delight the palate and boost lagging sales.  </LEADPARA>

SHAKEY'S BIDS TO REVIVE BUSINESS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We wanted to create some excitement," said President Gene Stone.;   
Shakey's started out in 1954 in a converted grocery store in Sacramento and
eventually became the nation's first franchised pizza chain, Stone said.
Business peaked in the early 1970s with about 500 outlets, mostly in the
West.;    In recent years, Shakey's has fallen to seventh place in profits
nationwide. The operation has 188 outlets throughout the country and another
188 stores overseas, including ones in Singapore and Saudi Arabia, according
to spokesman Eric Wildermuth.;    Tailoring some pizza specials for holidays,
Shakey's is offering an Octoberfest pizza with sauerkraut, Canadian bacon and
maybe even some bratwurst.;    "It's quite tasty," Stone said. "It adds a
little crunch to the pizza.";    Other holidays merit their own pizzas, too.
For the Fourth of July, the All-American Cheeseburger Pizza is offered -- with
a pizza crust covered with sesame seeds and garnished with fresh tomato,
lettuce and dill pickle.;    For Cinco de Mayo, there's the Taco Pizza,
complete with refried beans and rice replacing the usual pizza sauce.;    And
just how do they come up with these ideas?;    "Usually we start with a theme
and from the theme comes the pizza," Stone said. "We really have hundreds of
varieties.";    Stores in foreign countries have spawned their own particular
taste treats, such as squid on the Singapore and other Southeast Asia menus.
In Mexico, cactus slices and other local treats became favorite toppings.;   
"It fools you sometimes what works and what doesn't," he said.;    Some,
believe it or not, never get out of the test kitchen. One recent failure was
cheese and chow mein pizza -- just plopping the noodles right down. One taste
and the verdict was in: nope.;    "In research and development, more stuff
hits the trash can than ever gets out," Stone said.  </TEXT>
