<HEAD>Man Who Took Pizza Workers Hostage Believed Upset Over `Noid' Commercials</HEAD>

   A man named Noid who held two pizza
employees hostage for five hours at gunpoint was angry over the
pizza chain's ``Avoid the Noid'' commercials, the man's uncle said
Tuesday.
   Kenneth Lamar Noid, 22, was arrested Monday after the five-hour
standoff at a Domino's pizza store ended with the hostages' escape.
   He was being held Tuesday on $250,000 bond in the DeKalb County
jail pending a Feb. 17 hearing on two counts of kidnapping, two
counts of aggravated assault and theft by extortion.
   Noid had expressed anger to his mother, Julia, about the
commercials, ``but I guess she didn't think it would rise to this,''
his uncle, David Noid, said.
   Domino's national television advertising campaign features the
``Noid,'' a red-hatted gremlin who tries to foil Domino's pizza
deliveries but always fails.
   Chamblee Police Chief Reed Miller said Kenneth Noid told police
that he thinks Tom S. Monaghan, owner of the Detroit-based pizza
chain and the Detroit Tigers baseball club, ``comes in his apartment
and looks around.''
   Investigators believe Noid was ``having an ongoing feud in his
mind with Monaghan about the `Noid' commercials,'' said Sgt. Mark
Bender, a Chamblee police detective. ``Apparently, he thinks they're
aimed at him.''
   Police said Noid, armed with a .357-caliber Magnum, entered the
suburban Atlanta store Monday and made one of the employees call
Chamblee police to tell them he had taken hostages and to stay clear
of the area.
   When police arrived, Noid fired four warning shots into the
ceiling of the store, Capt. Dave M. Perkins said. Police did not
return the fire.
   Noid demanded $100,000, a getaway car and a science fiction book
titled ``The Widow's Son,'' police said. He also ordered and ate a
pizza.
   The two employees, Sean Burnsed, 22, and Darrell L. Wilson, 25,
escaped unharmed while Noid's back was turned. Noid gave up minutes
later, police said.
