<HEAD>Friends of Dead Driver Protest Pizza Chain's Delivery Promise</HEAD>

   Domino's Pizza Inc.'s 30-minute delivery
guarantee is being challenged by area residents after an accident
that claimed a 17-year-old's life, the latest in a series of wrecks
involving company drivers.
   The dead youth's relatives and friends are circulating petitions
asking Indiana's congressional members to seek federal restrictions
on Domino's promise to deliver an order within 30 minutes or cut the
price by $3.
   ``I don't want another mother to have to go through what I've
been through,'' said Suzanne Boutros, whose son, Jesse Colson, died
June 3 while speeding to deliver a pizza for a Domino's store in
Mooresville almost 18 miles southwest of here.
   The Plainfield youth's small pickup truck went off a
rain-slickened road and hit a utility pole two miles east of
Mooresville, authorities said.
   ``It's awful,'' Ms. Boutros said Sunday. ``But there are still
thousands of kids all across the country out there doing the same
thing.''
   She called Domino's guarantee ``an invitation to break the law,
to speed.''
   Domino's officials said its drivers do not have to speed to make
the deadline.
   The night before Colson's death, a Domino's deliveryman in
Shelbyville nearly 30 miles southeast of Indianapolis was involved
in an accident near there, but no one was seriously injured.
   Three Domino's drivers were involved in traffic accidents last
year in Hendricks County alone, said authorities in Colson's home
county.
   Domino's does not keep accident totals, spokesman Ron Hingst said
from the 5,000-store chain's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Colson, a Plainfield High School junior, had worked as a
deliveryman since January.
   ``We had discussed it,'' Ms. Boutros said. ``He didn't like it; I
didn't like it.''
   Colson's girlfriend, Kelly Lowe, 17, who also works for Domino's,
said workers who tallied the largest number of late deliveries
received a badge that read ``King of Lates.'' Colson had never
received the badge.
   ``He didn't like to have late pizzas,'' Miss Lowe said. ``He
always talked about how he never had any lates.''
   Domino's maintains its pizzas are made in 10 to 15 minutes,
allowing ample time for orders to be delivered.
   ``If people would go visit our stores and see this system in
action, I think it would help them understand. That's where the
speed of our system is,'' said Hingst.
   Steve Osmun, who owns the Mooresville franchise, said he urges
employees to offer the discount before endangering their lives.
   ``We don't advocate anyone speeding,'' Osmun said.
   He said he was unaware of the ``King of Lates'' badge and does
not approve of it.
