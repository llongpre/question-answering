   Domino's Pizza Inc. advertises
``Domino's delivers,'' and the company delivered its annual report
this year in an unmistakably shaped 12\-inch-by-12\-inch flip-open
box.
   ``That would be a small medium,'' said Ron Hingst, one of those
involved in what has become a tradition of non-traditional annual
reports.
   The 1986 version was in the form of a spiral school-style
notebook with tabbed dividers for different subjects. An earlier
report came with a set of dominos.
   ``It's a chance for the financial guys to play marketing,''
Hingst said.
   This year's pizza-style box contained a cardboard jigsaw puzzle
of the Domino's Pizza name and trademark, and the report, with a
quotation from Thomas S. Monaghan, chairman and founder, on the
cover: ``1987 was the year we worked hard to pull all the pieces
together.''
   Along with sections on areas such as development and service,
the report gave financial results reported earlier: net income of
$7.7 million on total revenue of $883.7 million for 1987, up from
$7.1 million on revenue of $721.6 million for 1986.
   Because Domino's is privately-held, its annual report goes to
suppliers, media contacts, and other people and companies it deals
with, Hingst said.
