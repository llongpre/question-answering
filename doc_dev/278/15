   Domino's Pizza Inc., the subject of
criticism for a series of fatal traffic accidents involving its
delivery drivers, has told its stores to fire or reassign drivers
who are under the age of 18, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Domino's spokesman Ron Hingst said federal law prohibited the
comapny from hiring drivers younger than 18, but in some cases
people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering pizzas.
   Company-owned stores were being told that employees under 18 who
drive should be fired or given other jobs, Hingst said. The move
will affect about 300 employees at Domino's company-owned stores,
about one-third of the Domino's 5,000 stores nationally, he said.
   The remaining two-thirds of the stores are franchises, which were
being urged to make the same move, Hingst said.
   The company's directive led to confusion at a Miami, Fla.,
Domino's store that gave pink slips to all its under-18 employees on
Wednesday. Those under 18 who don't drive were rehired later that
day, the company stated.
   ``There was some miscommunication on our part,'' Hingst said.
   Domino's has acknowledged 20 fatal accidents in the last year
involving its drivers, but denies the company's 29-year-old promise
to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a telephone order encourages
employees' reckless driving.
   A 17-year-old Domino's driver, Jesse Colson, was killed earlier
this month when his small pickup truck skidded on a rain-slicked
Indiana road and hit a utility pole.
   His mother has claimed he was speeding and that Domino's
guarantee was ``an invitation to break the law.''
   Domino's has stated it knows of 20 fatalities involving Domino's
drivers, pedestrians and others last year, but that accidents were
bound to happen with such a large fleet, believed to be about 75,000
to 80,000 drivers.
   Hingst said the directive on drivers under 18 was ``a reminder to
follow the guidelines.''
