   Domino's Pizza Inc., under fire for a
series of fatal traffic accidents involving delivery people, plans
to stop hiring employees under 18 although current workers can stay,
a spokesman said Thursday.
   The decision came after Florida parents complained about layoffs
following an earlier directive to re-assign or fire drivers under 18.
   But Domino's will recommend that its stores not hire people under
18 for driving or non-driving jobs in the future, spokesman Ron
Hingst said.
   The earlier move led to confusion when at least one Domino's
outlet in Miami gave pink slips to all employees under 18 on
Wednesday.
   Domino's Florida division gave instructions to discharge all
workers under 18, but modified them later Wednesday after parents
complained to the company's regional office in Pompano Beach, Hingst
said.
   ``Some of our people jumped the gun,'' he said. ``There was some
miscommunication on our part.''
   Hingst said it was Domino's policy to comply with federal law
prohibiting the hiring of drivers younger than 18. In some cases,
however, people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering
pizzas, he said.
   Domino's has acknowledged 20 fatalities in the last year in
accidents involving its drivers, but denies the company's
29-year-old promise to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a
telephone order encourages employees' reckless driving.
   Federal child labor laws forbid hiring people under 18 for
several hazardous occupations, including drivers. The law doesn't
rule out occasional driving for younger workers, however.
   Domino's re-examined its hiring practices after June 3, when
deliveryman Jesse Colson, 17, died in a one-vehicle accident in
Indianapolis.
   His mother has claimed he was speeding and that Domino's
guarantee was ``an invitation to break the law.''
   But Hingst said the hiring directive was ``a reminder to follow
the guidelines. We decided to have everybody review their employees
on individual basis.''
   The U.S. Labor Department examined the Indianapolis accident and
would have directed regional officials to talk to Domino's if a
wider problem was suspected, said a department spokesman in
Washington, D.C.
   The department's assistant district director for Michigan,
Valeria Sobecki, said she hadn't been told to take up the question
with Domino's.
   Hingst said Domino's has talked with the Labor Department about
driver age requirements before. ``We had all our paperwork in
order,'' he said.
   The review will affect about 300 employees at company-owned
Domino's stores who are under 18, he said. Company-owned stores
comprise about one-third of Domino's 5,000 stores nationwide.
   The remaining two-thirds of the stores are franchises. Hingst
said franchise owners were being urged to make the same move.
   ``It is highly recommended to the franchises, but it isn't
contractually binding,'' he said.
   Domino's company-owned stores and franchises combined have about
150,000 employees, including 70,000 to 80,000 delivery drivers,
Hingst said.
