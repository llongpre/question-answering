   Thomas Monaghan, the mercurial chairman and owner of
Domino's Pizza Inc., retook control of his company by ousting
the men he put in charge two years ago.
   The pizza putsch is an about-face for the 54-year-old
entrepreneur, who had been steadily withdrawing from the
company that he founded and built into the nation's largest
pizza-delivery chain. Two years ago he even tried to sell
Domino's, but couldn't find a buyer at his $1.2 billion
asking price. After that, Mr. Monaghan said he would step out
of the company's day-to-day affairs to pursue philanthropic
and Catholic causes.

   But Domino's has struggled lately. Its dominance in the
pizza-delivery business has come under attack from archrival
Pizza Hut. Pizza margins have been slashed in recent years
because of discounting, particularly by smaller chains such
as Little Caesar's.
   And the heady expansion Domino's experienced while fanning
out nationwide in the 1970s and '80s has slowed to a crawl as
the company finds fewer new U.S. markets to exploit. The Ann
Arbor, Mich., company has tried to supplement its faltering
franchise growth through new ways of selling pizza. But those
efforts have been largely unsuccessful to date.
   So now Mr. Monaghan is back.
   "It is easier to be hands-on when you aren't separated
from your franchisees by another layer of management," Mr.
Monaghan said in a prepared statement.
   Among the four men ousted was David Black, 42, the
company's president and a former Domino's store manager and
franchisee who had become a Monaghan protege. The others were
Kevin Williams, vice president of operations; Douglas Dawson,
director of international operations, and Timothy Carr, vice
president of finance and administration.
   Messrs. Dawson and Carr will continue to work for Mr.
Monaghan as officers of his baseball team, the Detroit
Tigers, according to the Detroit Free Press. The future of
Messrs. Black and Williams was uncertain. Domino's officials
couldn't be reached to comment.
   None of the men could be reached to comment. Earlier this
year, however, the now-dismissed executives had insisted they
were in charge of the company's daily operations, while Mr.
Monaghan was essentially relegated to acting as goodwill
ambassador to franchise owners -- this despite Mr. Monaghan's
publicly stated desire to reassert control over his company.
It isn't clear whether this apparent friction led to the
shake-up.
   The changes at Domino's cap what has been a year of
assertive, and often controversial, moves by Mr. Monaghan.
His Tigers have waged a running feud with Detroit and Wayne
County officials about where to build and how to pay for a
new baseball stadium for the team. The Tigers prefer a site
in the suburbs, while city and county officials want any new
stadium to be built in or near downtown Detroit.
   What's more, Mr. Monaghan, a devout Catholic, appears to
have done a lot of soul-searching this year. In a recent
lengthy interview with the religion editor of the Detroit
News, Mr. Monaghan -- who has shelled out millions of dollars
to build an impressive collection of antique automobiles --
said he had been excessively materialistic in the past.
   As penance, he said, he now fasts on bread and water two
days a week. And he said he refuses to occupy a luxurious new
office he recently had built at Domino's headquarters at a
cost of $2 million.
   It isn't clear what new recipe Mr. Monaghan has in mind
for Domino's, but the company clearly needs something. Last
year Domino's had profit of $5.4 million on sales $2.65
billion. Those sales were up only 6% from 1989, and company
officials have said they expect this year's sales to be flat
with last year.
   Domino's, which owned 70% of the U.S. pizza-delivery
market five years ago, has seen its share in this segment
erode to 60%. The winner has been PepsiCo's Pizza Hut, which
entered the delivery market late and has taken a 20% share.
In retaliation, Domino's officials set plans to press the
marketing of pan pizza, a type for which Pizza Hut is
popular.
