<HEAD>Domino's Signs One-Year Test for Pizza in Four Burger Kings</HEAD>

   You won't be able to have it your way
just yet, but this September Burger King will begin test marketing
6-inch Domino's pizzas at four South Carolina hamburger restaurants.
   The one-year experiment is aimed at McDonald's Corp.'s test of
its own pizza in 200 of its eateries.
   A licensing agreement was signed last week between Burger King,
the nation's second largest fast-food chain, and Domino's newly
created Pizzazz Division. It calls for test marketing at four
restaurants in Columbia, S.C., Domino's spokesman Burke Cueny said
Tuesday.
   Cueny said toppings for the pizzas have yet to be determined and
the four stores will offer two or three kinds of pies at the start.
   ``There may be a point where we will offer larger-style pizzas
down the road,'' he said. There are 22 Burger King outlets in the
Columbia area, which is home of the University of South Carolina.
   McDonald's, the nation's largest fast-food chain, currently
sells 14-inch pizzas in about 200 restaurants located in and around
Evansville, Ind., Las Vegas, Hartford, Conn., and Fresno, Calif.,
said company spokesman Chuck Ebeling.
   ``The test is going very well and we think the future of that
product looks bright,'' he said. Ebeling refused to say when
McDonald's would decide whether to expand the program.
   McDonald's pizzas, which the company makes itself, come with
cheese, sausage, pepperoni or a combination of those toppings. They
cost between $6 and $10, depending on toppings and markets, Ebeling
said.
   Burger King, bought last year by Grand Metropolitan PLC, has
about 6,000 stores nationwide. Domino's, which owner Tom Monaghan
has said is up for sale, has about 5,000 kitchen and delivery
outlets, and is the largest pizza delivery company in the nation.
   ``Whether the company is being sold or not, we're making some
good long-term decisions,'' said Pizzazz Vice President Glenn
Mueller. ``(Domino's President) Dave Black and the management at
Domino's Pizza is getting back to growth. They're trying new and
innovative ways.''
   Domino's hopes Pizzazz will add 1,000 new outlets and $500
million in annual sales by 1993. Some of Domino's Pizzazz stores
will have tables and chairs, some will be drive-through and others
may offer carryout services.
