   Pillsbury Co. is expected to sell its Godfather's Pizza chain shortly, perhaps for $50 million, but the food giant is finding solutions to its other restaurant problems more elusive. 

   While investors led by Godfather's senior management say they have nearly completed negotiations to buy the 580-store unit, the transaction apparently won't be completed before Pillsbury closes its books on a very disappointing fiscal year next Tuesday. 
The prospective buyers are led by Herman Cain, president, and Ronald B. Gartlan, executive vice president of the Omaha, Neb.-based chain. 
The $50 million sale-price estimate comes from analysts. 

   Selling Godfather's could provide a much-needed boost to Pillsbury's results. 
The company has taken more than $140 million in restructuring charges in recent months. 
It reported a $107.8 million loss for the quarter ended Feb. 29 and said at the time that it was putting Godfather's up for sale. 
Pillsbury is expected to post only a modest profit for the fiscal year. 
A year earlier, it earned $182 million. 

   Burger King USA, Pillsbury's biggest single business, also remains its largest problem. 
Despite a management shake-up and an expensive new advertising campaign, franchisees report disappointing sales. 
"Let's just say, it's not a roaring success," said one West Coast franchisee of the "we do it like you'd do it" promotional theme. 
"A successful ad campaign will drive sales, and we don't see that happening." 
A Pillsbury spokesman said Burger King sales in the fiscal fourth quarter have been "flat." 

   Analyst L. Craig Carver, who tracks Pillsbury for Dain, Bosworth &amp; Co. of Minneapolis, says, "The franchisee is a bigger problem than the ad campaign. 
Getting them geared up again, firmly supporting the program, that's another set of circumstances." 

   Godfather's is the fourth restaurant operation that Minneapolis-based Pillsbury is shedding. 
Earlier it signed a letter of intent to dispose of its 16-unit Bay Street seafood chain. 
It is negotiating the sale of the two Key West Grill Caribbean-style restaurants and eight Quik Wok outlets. 

   Pillsbury also recently sold a small vegetable cannery and is closing a pizza plant in Tennessee. 
The company now expects to take in about $100 million from asset sales over the next year. 

   Despite speculation that Pillsbury might also dispose of its 166-unit Steak &amp; Ale and 212-unit Bennigan's chains, the company said, "They are not for sale." 
Previously, Pillsbury said it was determined to retain the 5,400-unit Burger King operation. 

   A Pillsbury spokesman said company representatives are "actively talking with candidates" to succeed William H. Spoor as chairman and chief executive officer. 
Mr. Spoor emerged from retirement to serve as interim chief executive after his hand-picked successor, John M. Stafford, resigned under fire Feb. 29. 
But the spokesman said a new chairman isn't likely to be named for several months. 

   Godfather's was one of Mr. Stafford's first acquisitions, and came as part of the 1985 purchase of Diversifoods Inc., a large Burger King franchisee. 
That acquisition cost Pillsbury about $400 million. 

   The pizza chain's portion of that amount hasn't been disclosed. 
Mr. Carver said $50 million would be "a good price" for the chain, which Pillsbury said recently has made "meaningful progress" in turning around but lacks the near-term potential to be a major strategic asset. 

   As pizza wars intensified, with the rise of Domino's and other national chains, Godfather's gradually has shrunk. 
When Pillsbury acquired it, there were 671 outlets. 
Last year that dropped to 605, and in the quarter just ended another 21 units closed, while nine new ones opened. 

   With estimated sales of $261 million in 1987, the Pillsbury unit ranked fifth, behind Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesar's and Pizza Inn. 
By contrast, Pizza Hut, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., reported sales of $2.5 billion last year. 

   Pillsbury stock rose 87.5 cents yesterday to close at $36.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
