First it was burgers, then fried chicken, and now pizzas, as the Indian
government continues to attract international fast-food companies to the
country's newly-liberalised markets.
Pizza Hut International, a subsidiary of the US food and drink conglomerate
PepsiCo, has been given permission to establish a 100 per cent-owned company
in India, which will set up a chain of pizza restaurants with an investment
of some Dollars 40m spread over seven years.
The approval follows the clearance in November of a similar Dollars 40m
proposal from Kentucky Fried Chicken, another PepsiCo subsidiary, to extend
the world's largest chicken restaurant system of 9,000 restaurants in 68
countries to India.
Earlier last year, McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain, received
permission to set up shop in India.
Meanwhile, Burger King, the second-largest fast food chain in the US, has
been exploring, the Indian market, but has yet to finalise its plans for
India, which may include a local partner.
The American fast-food giants, which have successfully expanded their chains
of outlets to new markets in China and Russia, are confident that India,
with its burgeoning middle class, provides excellent potential for the food
industry.
A detailed feasibility study by Burger King has illustrated that India is a
more suitable market for fast foods than China.
This explains PepsiCo's decision to make New Delhi the venue of its largest
restaurant yet - a 600-seater flagship store that will house both Pizza Hut
and Kentucky Fried Chicken under one roof.
The company says the decision to combine the chicken and pizza outlets is
the result of market research, which showed that Indians preferred a variety
of foods to be served in a restaurant, and that single-fare outlets would
not do well in the Indian market, where large families eating out prefer
multi-cuisine restaurants.
This is best illustrated by Nirula's, a Delhi-based fast food chain which
offers a range of foods and cuisines, from burgers and pizza to kebabs and
curries.
Nirula's has contributed substantially to introducing middle-class Indians
to western-style 'junk' foods. The family-owned company would rather not
disclose its turnover, but an indication of its size is that it serves over
40,000 customers each day through its 11 outlets in Delhi, and has three
busy restaurants in Nepal and one in Muscat.
Nirula's has held its ground to competition from foreign entrants such as
Wimpy's, the UK chain, which enter-ed India through a local Indian partner
several years ago, but has had difficulty break-ing into the market.
'The Indian market is extremely tempting but there are very real problems
here, and the foreign chains have no idea what the odds against them are,'
says a successful Indian restaurateur.
One hurdle for foreign chains is the unavailability of some western
ingredients, and religious taboos on others.
McDonald's and Burger King earn a large chunk of their revenue from beef and
pork burgers, which would not find favour with Indian clients, who prefer
goat or lamb if they eat meat.
Kentucky Fried is not too happy about the quality of chicken and fat for
frying in the local market. And Pizza Hut will have to set up its own
factory for a steady supply of Mozarella cheese.
Indian wheat is too soft for pizza bases, and so hard wheat will have to be
grown or imported. And specialised kitchen equipment will also be subject to
government licensing.
'Our main problem is to set up a supply chain for pizza toppings, chicken,
fat and wheat,' said a PepsiCo executive. Both subsidiaries will need until
at least September to launch their chains.
