   Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan
said Friday he may sell the biggest slice of his pizza delivery
business to employees.
   Domino's has retained Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
to study the feasibility of an employee stock ownership plan,
Monaghan said in a news release.
   He said he will decide whether to implement an ESOP on
completion of the study, and will remain as chairman of Domino's if
one is adopted.
   Monaghan, 52, said in September he was considering selling
Domino's to spend more time on charitable activities. He founded
the company in 1960 and owns 97 percent of it.
   He has considered alternatives that include creation of an ESOP,
sale to a corporate buyer or taking the privately held firm public
by selling stock, spokeswoman Judy Boulter said.
   Under an ESOP, Domino's would borrow money, lend it to employees
as a group to buy a majority share in the company, and distribute
stock to employees as a benefit redeemable as the loan is paid off.
   Doug Dawson, treasurer and vice president of finance and
administration, has had discussions with employees about the
possibility of an ESOP. ``I think they're very excited about it,''
he said.
   He said it hadn't been determined how many of Domino's
approximately 5,000 full-time employees would be eligible to
participate. The investment bankers would look into that, he said.
   Monaghan has said he wants to spend more time on work with the
Roman Catholic Church and other philanthropic activities, including
Legatus, a group he founded for Catholic chief executive officers.
   Some industry observers speculate Monaghan is considering an
ESOP because of trouble finding outside buyers who are interested
in the company.
   ``The problem is, it's not a very profitable company,'' Milford
Prewett of Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication in New
York, said this week.
   Domino's, the nation's second largest pizza chain behind Pizza
Hut, reported it earned $6.1 million last year on sales of $2.3
billion.
