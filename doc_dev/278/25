   McDonald's has flipped billions of
burgers and tossed chef salads for the masses, but now it's toying
with pizza-craving palates in a move aimed at giving Pizza Hut and
Domino's pepperoni heartburn.
   The latest addition to McDonald's menu is a 14-inch pizza, served
as an experiment in a few test markets. It's designed to woo
families and couples, who might not normally frequent the fast-food
giant for supper.
   So far the pizza made of quick-cooking crust and fresh toppings
seems to be getting good reviews, partly because it's ready in a few
minutes, faster than fastest Pizza Hut or Domino's pizza car.
   The experiment began July 10 at a McDonald's in Evansville. Now
16 stores in Evansville and nearby Owensboro, Ky., are serving
McDonald's Pizzas daily after 4 p.m.
   McDonald's won't say how sales are going and the company hasn't
decided whether the pizzas will earn a permanent place on the menu.
   ``It's very preliminary testing at this point,'' said Terri
Capatosto, a spokeswoman at McDonald's Corp.'s headquarters in Oak
Brook, Ill.
   Ms. Capatosto said pizzas aren't sold until late afternoon
because market research indicates pizza is eaten by families or
couples, usually at dinnertime. She declined to explain why the
product was being introduced now.
   ``We tested salads for 12 years before we rolled them out
nationally last year,'' Ms. Capatosto said. ``We tested McNuggets
for two years.''
   Fast-food industry analysts said they weren't surprised by the
McDonald's pizza experiment, partly because the company has a
history of menu innovations to lure new customers during slack hours.
   ``Their main day business is lunch and breakfast is pretty
successful,'' said Robert Bernstein, who follows McDonald's for
Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., a St. Louis-based investment company.
   ``Their evenings aren't as crowded,'' Bernstein said. ``Let's say
it's not as strong as they would like it. Chicken and burgers are
finger food on-the-go. Pizza food is sit down and enjoy the evening
meal. They think that could improve their overall business.''
   The pizzas come in four varieties _ cheese, pepperoni, sausage
and deluxe, which includes pepperoni, sausage, green peppers,
mushrooms and tomato slices. Prices range from $5.84 to $9.49.
   Test stores have been remodeled to include a special ``Pizza
Shoppe,'' where customers can watch employees spread the ingredients
on ready-made dough brought in from bakeries.
   ``It's weird to go into McDonald's and order a pizza,'' said
Julie Bales, a 16-year-old customer from Owensboro munching on a few
slices of pepperoni pizza. ``But you don't have to wait. I only had
to wait about three minutes.''
   ``People hang out here, and you have to buy something to stay
here,'' she said. ``You might as well get pizza.''
   A friend, Amanda Hagan, 16, of Owensboro, said she also sampled
the pizza.
   ``That crust tastes kind of like cardboard, but I like the
topping,'' she said.
   Rene and George Jones of Rockport, Ind., said they were
pleasantly surprised by the taste.
   ``It's in between frozen and the kind you buy at Pizza Hut,''
said Mrs. Jones, 25. ``It's a lot better than frozen for what you
pay.''
   Jones, 31, said ``It's not as spicy as other pizzas. But it
doesn't taste greasy.''
   McDonald's experimented with small individual pizzas in test
markets a few years ago, then evidently dropped the idea. This is
the company's first foray into large pizzas aimed at attracting more
than one eater.
   Regardless of whether McDonald's Pizza becomes a permanent item,
the tests are enough to have the giants of the pizza-restaurant
business worried that McDonald's, with 8,300 stores nationwide,
could grab a piece of their pie.
   ``We certainly don't take McDonald's lightly,'' said Roger
Rydell, spokesman for No. 1 Pizza Hut Inc., a 7,000-chain network
with sales expected to reach $3.2 billion this year. ``It's an
enormous company with tremendous resources. We're going to have to
deal with it and we'll be fierce competitors.''
   Rydell said Pizza Hut has prepared a marketing plan to deal with
the competition.
   ``We would not want to tip our hand,'' he said. ``But we are
going to treat the tests in that particular market the way we treat
any encroachment.''
   Domino's Pizza, Inc., ranked No. 2 with 5,020 outlets and
expected 1989 sales of $2.1 billion, also is watching the McDonald's
experiment closely, said Michael Raymond, divisional vice president
of marketing.
   ``Any time you have a company the size of McDonald's with the
marketing clout McDonald's has, you have to go on full alert,''
Raymond said.
   But he said McDonald's isn't considered a direct threat, partly
because Domino's has concentrated much of its strength on pizza
delivery to homes and offices. McDonald's doesn't deliver pizza as
part of its experiment, while Domino's, Raymond said, is ``a phone
call away.''
