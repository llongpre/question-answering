<LEADPARA>  AT&amp;T and Domino's Pizza are testing a new service that could revolutionize how
consumers obtain goods and services by telephone, from ordering fast food to
getting emergency road repairs.;   The service is a toll-free nationwide
telephone number that does not require a caller to dial an area code. Calls
are routed to the most convenient branch office or franchisee of a national
chain, just as though the caller had dialed the local office directly.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Easier numbers; The new service seems to have several advantages over
widely used "800" numbers, which connect callers to a central bank of
telephone operators. Called Store Finder, it uses just seven digits, not 11,
and all will start with "950." That makes the number easier to remember and
therefore easier to advertise.;   Using innovative computerized map-reading to
match callers' telephone numbers with stores, Store Finder takes seven to 11
seconds to complete a call -- only a few seconds more than a normal call. It
is also much faster than the several minutes it might take for a human
operator to answer an 800 number, consult a map, find a store and confirm that
the caller's location and the store are really in the same area.;   Likely
users; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has not yet started marketing the
service but says almost any national business that depends on a network of
outlets might be interested. Rental car agencies, florists, clothing stores
and repair centers, even insurance companies and auto dealerships, would be
among the most likely users.;   "This service provides a company with a way of
establishing a national identity, but with a local feeling," said Priscilla
Cronin, product manager for AT&amp;T Transaction Services, which is developing the
service.;   Domino's idea; It is no coincidence that Domino's Pizza Inc., the
nation's largest pizza-delivery company, is the first to test Store Finder.
Domino's, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., came up with the idea. AT&amp;T is providing
the equipment and computer know-how to make it work. The service has taken two
years to develop.;   Domino's, which is privately owned, is facing pressure
from an aggressively expanding Pizza Hut and is eager to develop the service
to keep its edge over its rival.;   Domino's still has a 50 percent share of
the pizza-delivery market, which last year totaled more than $5 billion. But
where it once had that market nearly all to itself, it is now getting big
competition from the much larger Pizza Hut, a Pepsico Inc. subsidiary with
nearly $5 billion in revenue worldwide last year and now with nearly a quarter
of the delivery market as well.;   The results so far in a three-month trial
of Store Finder in Jacksonville, Fla., are promising, according to AT&amp;T.;  
But a few bugs remain. Like a panicked short-order cook, in the rare instances
when it is overwhelmed by calls, the system can shove out store assignments at
random. Mobile telephones and unlisted numbers pose some problems, too.
Accordingly, AT&amp;T and Domino's researchers still must determine whether the
system can work under all likely conditions. If the continuing tests are
successful, AT&amp;T immediately will begin trying to sell Store Finder to other
companies.;   Domino's, which last year sold nearly $2.7 billion worth of
pizzas and sodas, estimated that Store Finder would cost less than $10 million
to install nationwide and about $30 million a year to operate but would be of
incalculable benefit in customer good will. In addition, Domino's would save
perhaps $2.5 million annually in lower expenditures for local Yellow Pages
advertising.  </TEXT>
