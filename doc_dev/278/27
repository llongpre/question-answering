<HEAD>Pizza Chain to Stress Speed in Kitchen, Not on Streets</HEAD>

   Domino's Pizza Inc., accused of
endangering motorists as its drivers hustle to make deliveries
within 30 minutes, will begin telling its side of the story on its
pizza boxes.
   The nationwide publicity campaign will focus on Domino's claim
that it puts a premium on speed in its kitchens, not on the streets.
   In a letter to be attached to 21 million Domino's boxes, company
President Dave Black writes in part, ``Yes, a 30-minute delivery is
important, but safe delivery is more important.''
   The campaign follows a lawsuit filed in Pittsburgh by a couple
who claim they were injured in a collision with a Domino's delivery
car and that the store manager was more concerned about haste in
delivery than the accident.
   The store manager rushed to the scene and said: ``Let's get this
pizza on the road,'' according to the lawsuit filed earlier this
year by Frank and Mary Jean Kranack.
   The company has denied the allegation that the manager was more
worried about the pizza than the wreck.
   The Ann Arbor-based chain said its 75,000 to 80,000 drivers were
involved in 20 fatal accidents in 1988 and three so far this year.
