'Location is what makes the difference in this business, then quality of
service,' says Mr Paul Tsouloufris of Food Plus, which took over the Pizza
Hut franchise for Greece two years ago.
Pizza Hut, part of the Pepsico group, had made little progress in Athens
under its first franchisee, although pizzas were already popular in Greece
and other foreign franchising operations were growing fast.
Since Food Plus acquired the franchise the number of outlets has grown from
two to six. Most are situated in the Athens suburbs in order to exploit
opportunities for home delivery and take-out services.
Mr Tsouloufris says that Food Plus differs from other Greek franchisees in
seeing Pizza Hut as an investment opportunity rather than a source of quick
returns. The company is putting Dr1bn (Dollars 4m) into developing the Pizza
Hut network - considerably more than any other local franchise operation in
Greece.
'Pizza could become the number one fast food in Greece by the end of the
decade,' he says. 'We decided we should operate and manage all the outlets
ourselves, although it meant that growth would be slower.'
Turnover this year is forecast at about Dr2bn, up from Dr570m in 1993.
Profits are projected at about Dr200m, against a loss of Dr200,000 last
year.
Food Plus aims at opening another 20 Pizza Hut outlets around Greece in the
next three years. By then, Mr Tsouloufris says, it should have become
Greece's leading pizza chain in delivery. Food Plus also aims at achieving
standards of service which will set Pizza Hut apart from other fast-food
chains.
Its outlets are designed to compete with restaurants and attract customers
in their 20s and 30s, Mr Tsouloufris says. 'Eating in is how the brand gets
established, so we want to impress people with quality, both product and
service. At the moment, too, Greek customers will pay a premium for good
service.'
The list of reminders for Pizza Hut waiters includes details often
overlooked in Greek tavernas, such as opening the door for customers or
offering to hang up their coats.
Mr Tsouloufris says that a few concessions are made to Greek tastes in
pizza, including one that features olives and feta cheese, 'but the concern
is really to maintain a consistent product. The great advantage is having
access to Pizza Hut's knowhow. In Greece we're bad at organising, and that's
where the franchisor really helps.'
