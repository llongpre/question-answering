<LEADPARA>  The nation's school lunch program may be calling out for fresh pizza before
long.;    The House Agriculture Committee has approved an amendment that would
allow the U.S. Department of Agriculture to change regulations that have kept
the fresh pizza industry from delivering their meat-topped pizzas to school
cafeterias.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The change means pizza purveyors such as Pizza Hut and Domino's could get a
slice of the school lunch program, which served up more than $432 million in
frozen pizza last year. The prospect has the pizza makers salivating.;    "All
we want is to be able to compete in that marketplace," said Larry Whitt, vice
president of public affairs for Pizza Hut. "And clearly we think this is a
marketplace with very good possibilities for our continued growth.";    The
fresh pizza industry has fought for years for an exemption to statutes that
require additional federal inspection of fresh meat pizzas if they are to be
served in a school.;    Meat already has two federal inspections -- the
slaughterhouse and at the processing plant -- before it is sprinkled on a
pizza, the industry says.;    Restaurants are exempted from the inspection
clause when selling meat dishes -- including pizza delivered at home --
directly to a customer.;    The pizza chains also complain the school
inspection requirement is unfair because a number of other products with meat
served in the school lunch line, such as sandwiches and hamburgers, have a
USDA exemption.;    The pizza makers already sell cheese and vegetable-topped
pizzas in the schools without the extra inspection, but meat pizzas --
particularly pepperoni -- are what the kids crave.;    Many of the chains are
selling a modified pepperoni pizza to school systems around the country, but
with so little pepperoni the companies are able to skirt the inspection
regulations. Pizza Hut officials, for instance, estimate they sell that kind
of pizza to 1,300 schools.;    "We're dealing with outdated regulations that
keep fresh pizza out of the market. There's no health and safety issue here,"
said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., sponsor of the amendment and the Congress
member whose district includes Pizza Hut's headquarters in Wichita.  </TEXT>
