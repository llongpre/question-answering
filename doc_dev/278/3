   Two familiar giants are squaring off in Evansville, Ind., and it looks like McWar. 

   Pizza Hut Inc., the nation's largest pizza chain, is launching an advertising campaign that attacks McDonald's Corp.'s entry into the pizza business. 
Thirty-second television commercials, which were to begin running last night in the Evansville market, combine humor and nastiness in knocking McDonald's for using frozen dough. 

   The spots liken McDonald's dough to a hockey puck being slapped around the TV screen. 
"Don't be McFooled," the ad counsels. 
Noting that PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut uses only fresh pizza dough, the commercial advises viewers, "Get a fresh-baked pan pizza from Pizza Hut." 
When McDonald's, the world's biggest fast-food chain, tried another pizza product in 1987, its frozen dough "received a cold reception," the spot claims. 

   A McDonald's spokesman said the company wanted to thank Pizza Hut "for giving our own ad campaign some extra topping." 
The spokesman added that "customers seem to be loving" the McDonald's pizza, though he wouldn't be more specific about how the new product is faring. 

   McDonald's is testing pizza in Evansville as part of an effort to entice customers in during the dinner hour -- its slowest time of the day. 
In Texas, McDonald's is testing a fried chicken product. 
So far, Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., another PepsiCo unit, hasn't gone after McDonald's with any ads. 
But, says a spokesman for the chicken chain, "We're certainly watching the test closely." 

   Though Pizza Hut's spots are done with what the company's marketers say is a "wink," the chain is serious about stopping McDonald's before it rolls out a competing product nationwide. 
Pizza Hut, based in Wichita, Kan., now has 22% of the $14 billion-a-year market for pizza, which doesn't include sales at grocery stores. 

   Two other big pizza chains say they're taking a wait-and-see attitude toward McDonald's new product. 
"We want to wait for {McDonald's} to establish their initial effort before we have something to react to," says a spokesman for Domino's Inc., No. 2 in the pizza market with a 17% share. 
The delivery-based chain says it will research the impact of McDonald's test in Evansville on Domino's 12 area outlets, as well as where the McDonald's pizza customers are coming from. 

   The Evansville franchisee for Little Caesar's, the nation's No. 3 pizza chain, is taking a more relaxed attitude toward McDonald's pizza rollout, which has become one of the most closely watched tests ever of a fast-food product. 

   "McDonald's will sell some pizza," says B.T. Atherton, vice president of L&amp;A Ventures Inc., which operates a dozen Little Caesar's restaurants in the Evansville area. 
"But," he adds, "as with most things, when people think of pizza, they don't necessarily think of McDonald's -- just as they don't think of them for steak or barbecue." 
Mr. Atherton has sampled McDonald's product. 
His verdict: "It's very apparent that the crust is not made fresh daily." 

   Pizza Hut is hammering away at that point in print ads in the Evansville papers. 
"Great-tasting pizza is nothing to be clowned around with," the full-page ad says. 
It isn't "McFrozen. 
We offer a choice of three great crusts. 
Not just McOne. 
We have 12 toppings. . . . 
They McDon't. 
And finally, we have great pizzas for lunch and dinner. 
Not just after McFour o'clock." 

   The ad carries a line describing it as "a public service message." 
A Pizza Hut marketing official says that was done in jest, but a spokeswoman for the Advertising Council, a New York-based group that places public service ads for a variety of nonprofit organizations, questions whether it's appropriate. 
"I'm surprised they're allowed to leave that on there. 
Usually a public-service ad can't promote a product," she said. 

   In July, McDonald's began testing four varieties of a 14-inch pizza in two stores and in recent weeks expanded the test into 24 company-owned stores in and around Evansville. 
McDonald's is the latest of several companies to choose the Evansville area, which has representative demographics, as a test market. 
Evansville also is where Procter &amp; Gamble Co. first tested its Crest toothpaste. 

   As part of that test, McDonald's is blitzing the market with advertisements that emphasize the speed with which its pizza is baked. 
It will take no more than 5 1/2 minutes, promise the ads, which take a swipe at the longer time people normally wait for a restaurant pizza. 

   "It's just unreal how they've hit this market," Mr. Atherton says. 
"They run {ads} just about every hour, day and night. 
They've pulled out all the stops." 

   Though McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., says this pizza may not be any more successful than others it has tried, some small pizza operators in the test market aren't waiting. 
Coupons offering several dollars off competing products are available. 

   Pizza Hut isn't cutting prices, but it is doing just about everything else to trip up McDonald's, including taste tests with hundreds of customers, says David Novak, senior vice president of marketing. 
"We had overwhelming taste preference," Mr. Novak says. 
"It was hard to find people who didn't like our pizza better. 
Our crust is superior, our toppings are superior." 
Mr. Novak describes McDonald's product as "frozen pizza, a little bit better."
