   Domino's Pizza Inc. founder and owner Tom
Monaghan has resigned as president of the fast food empire, saying
he wants to serve the church instead of serving up more than $2
billion worth of pizza a year.
   Monaghan told thousands of Domino's employees via closed-circuit
television Monday that he would remain chairman and chief executive
officer, but was relinquishing the presidency.
   ``I love the day-to-day work at Domino's, but I want to serve the
church more,'' said Monaghan, 52. ``I always wanted to be a priest.''
   Monaghan, who owns the Detroit Tigers baseball team and is known
for his collection of classic cars and devotion to architect Frank
Lloyd Wright, holds 97.5 percent of Domino's stock. But said he
would consider selling the company if the transaction benefited
Domino's Pizza Foundation, which runs Monaghan's philanthropic
efforts.
   The foundation supports a Roman Catholic missionary priest in
Honduras, where Monaghan has dispatched planeloads of dentists,
doctors and medical supplies.
   ``We're building dams, teaching farming, setting up a medical
clinic and spreading the gospel,'' said Monaghan, who spent his
childhood in a Catholic orphanage and attended a Grand Rapids
seminary. He also founded Legatus, a group of Catholic business
executives who monitor business ethics.
   Monaghan said he plans to devote more time to Legatus and to
other church-related activities.
   Monaghan said he will concentrate on long-range planning and
leave daily responsibilities to David Black, 40, the company's new
president after eight years as vice president of operations.
   The last time Monaghan turned over Domino's reins was in 1975,
when Leroy Russell Hughes was named president. Hughes didn't last
long in the job.
   ``It just didn't work out,'' said Monaghan, adding that he
believed it was a mistake to hire an outsider. He said this time it
should work out because he hired a company veteran for the job.
   Monaghan founded Domino's in 1960. The pizza-delivery chain has
grown to 5,000 outlets in all 50 states and 16 countries, becoming
the nation's second-largest pizza maker after the Pizza Hut unit of
Pepsico Inc. It reported a 1988 profit of $6.1 million on sales of
$2.3 billion.
