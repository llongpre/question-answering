<HEAD>Domino's Pizza Sued For Firing Employee With Long Hair</HEAD>

   Domino's Pizza Inc.'s policy of requiring male
employees to keep their hair cut above the collar is discriminatory
because women are permitted to have long hair, a lawsuit filed
against the pizza chain says.
   The Wayne County Circuit Court lawsuit was filed Thursday by
Michael Pitt, an attorney appointed by the American Civil Liberties
Union to represent Scott Bedker, 17, of St. Clair Shores. Bedker
was told in January that he must cut his shoulder-length hair or
lose his job.
   The suit names RPM Inc., the franchisee; Domino's, the parent
company, and owner Thomas Monaghan. It seeks to get Bedker's job
back and end the company's policy about hair.
   Pitt said Bedker's hair in January was shoulder-length and
well-groomed, the style he had when he was hired in November 1986.
Bedker was told when hired to wear a cap with his hair folded under
for sanitary reasons. Women in similar jobs were instructed to
treat their hair the same way, Pitt said.
   ``But in January 1988 when the edict from Mr. Monaghan came down
that men had to cut their hair, there was no similar edict for
women,'' Pitt said. ``Scott was subject to different work standards
because of his sex.''
   Bedker, who recently graduated from high school, remains
unemployed and wants his job back at Domino's, where he made pizzas
and answered phones, Pitt said.
   Ron Hingst, Domino's national director of public relations, said
company attorneys hadn't seen the lawsuit and wouldn't comment, but
he added, ``We believe in our policies.''
