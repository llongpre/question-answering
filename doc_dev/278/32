<LEADPARA>  AT&amp;T and Domino's Pizza are testing a new service that could revolutionize how
consumers obtain goods and services by telephone, from ordering fast food to
getting emergency road repairs.;   The service is a toll-free nationwide
telephone number that does not require a caller to dial an area code. Calls
are routed to the most convenient branch office or franchisee of a national
chain, just as though the caller had dialed the local office directly.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new service seems to have several advantages over widely used "800"
numbers, which connect callers to a central bank of telephone operators.
Called Store Finder, it uses just seven digits, not 11, and all will start
with "950." That makes the number easier to remember and therefore easier to
advertise.;   Using innovative computerized map-reading to match callers'
telephone numbers with stores, Store Finder takes seven to 11 seconds to
complete a call -- only a few seconds more than a normal call. It is also much
faster than the several minutes it might take for a human operator to answer
an 800 number, consult a map, find a store and confirm that the caller's
location and the store are really in the same area.;   American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. has not yet started marketing the service but says almost any
national business that depends on a network of outlets might be interested.
Rental car agencies, florists, clothing stores and repair centers, even
insurance companies and auto dealerships, would be among the most likely
users.;   It is no coincidence that Domino's Pizza Inc., the nation's largest
pizza-delivery company, is the first to test Store Finder. Domino's, based in
Ann Arbor, Mich., came up with the idea. AT&amp;T is providing the equipment and
computer know-how to make it work. The service has taken two years to
develop.;   Domino's, which is privately owned, is facing pressure from an
aggressively expanding Pizza Hut.;   Domino's still has a 50 percent share of
the pizza-delivery market, which last year totaled more than $5 billion.;  
Domino's is testing the system in Jacksonville, Fla.  </TEXT>
