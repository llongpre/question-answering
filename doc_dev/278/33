<HEAD>Pizza Hut Launches Advertising `McWar' Against McDonald's Pizza</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pizza Hut Inc., evidently alarmed by a
McDonald's Corp. experimental marketing foray into pizza, has
launched an all-out advertising attack that accuses the fast-food
giant of using frozen dough.
   ``If you're looking for great pizza, make no Mcstake,'' say ads
that have been running in newspaper for the past few weeks in the
Evansville area, where McDonald's outlets have been selling pizza.
   ``We always use dough that's made fresh daily. Not McFrozen,''
the Pizza Hut ads say.
   The nation's largest pizza chain expanded the attack to
television commercials Thursday night.
   Pizza Hut launched the campaign in response to the addition of
pizza to menus at 24 McDonald's restaurants in southern Indiana and
western Kentucky earlier this summer. The McDonald's experiment is
aimed at attracting families and couples during the dinner hour, a
slack period in many fast-food outlets.
   The pizza, which comes in four varieties and ranges in price from
$5.84 to $9.49, is promised within 5{ minutes after customers place
an order.
   Although Pizza Hut owns about 22 percent of the $314
billion-a-year pizza market, it's not taking the McDonald's test
lightly.
   ``The television commercial is very humorous. We're being,
however, very serious to our approach to the McDonald's threat,''
said Roger Rydell, a spokesman for Pizza Hut in Wichita, Kan.
   ``We want to make it clear to them that we are very strong
competitors and make sure people are aware of the quality difference
between our two products,'' Rydell said Friday.
   Pizza Hut officials have not determined how long the advertising
campaign will last, Rydell said.
   ``It really depends on how long the test takes. Once we see
there's really no need to continue it, we'll discontinue it.''
   Rather than fighting back, McDonald's is ``McDelighted that they
noticed how good our test product is,'' said company spokesman Chuck
Rubner.
   ``We want to thank them for giving our own ad campaign some extra
topping,'' he said.
