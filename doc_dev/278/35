   After a Domino's Pizza delivery car hit Frank
Kranack's station wagon outside a suburban Domino's store, Kranack
said the manager rushed to the wreckage and demanded, ``Let's get
this pizza on the road.''
   ``With all the damage there, I just didn't believe he was worried
about the pizza,'' Kranack said this week.
   Kranack, 42, an accountant, claimed whiplash injury in the
October 1985 accident. His wife, Mary Jean, 42, claimed neck and
back injuries and says her right arm, nearest the impact, is
permanently disabled.
   The couple's attorney, Kenneth R. Behrend, filed a lawsuit for
damages _ not against the 18-year-old driver, but against Domino's
Pizza Inc., claiming in part that the company encourages dangerous
driving with its trademark 30-minute delivery guarantee.
   ``People are being injured all over the country,'' Behrend said.
``These drivers are trying to deliver pizzas within 30 minutes and
sometimes it's just not physically possible. They may run a stop
sign, go over speed limits or make illegal turns.''
   Domino's denies Behrend's charge, says the company constantly
reminds its drivers that safety is important and disqualifies
delivery people with three or more serious moving violations.
   Behrend said he has gathered information on at least 30 serious
accidents in recent years related to Domino's speedy delivery.
   Ron Hingst, Domino's spokesman at its Ann Arbor, Mich.,
headquarters, said the company knows of 20 fatalities involving
Domino's drivers, pedestrians and others last year, but that
accidents are bound to happen in such a large fleet, believed to be
about 75,000 to 80,000 drivers.
   Jesse Colson apparently was Domino's most recent death this year.
   Colson, 17, of Plainfield, Ind., a Domino's driver working 18
miles southwest of Indianapolis, was killed June 3 when his small
pickup truck skidded on a rain-slicked road and hit a utility pole.
His mother, Suzanne Butros, said he was speeding and called Domino's
guarantee ``an invitation to break the law.''
   Ed Kelley, police chief in St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., said in
1987 his department had to crack down on speeding Domino's drivers.
   ``When we catch them, it's going to be one driver to go,'' Kelley
said at the time.
   Hingst said the Domino's dominance of the home-delivery pizza
business is based on its famous 29-year-old promise to deliver pizza
within 30 minutes of a telephone order.
   Last year, Domino's sold about 230 million pizzas, delivering
about 90 percent, from about 5,000 owned and franchised stores in
the United States, Hingst said.
   The company has grown from just 300 outlets in 1980 in part on
its boast it would deliver the pizza for free if its drivers were
late, within a specified radius.
   Now, Hingst said, Domino's gives a $3 refund for a late pizza
because some customers, particularly college students, deliberately
gave imprecise directions just to get free food.
   Behrend and other lawyers are trading information about Domino's
and its delivery guarantee.
   ``I want to see the 30-minute guarantee stopped and my client
wants it stopped,'' Behrend said.
   Hingst said said Domino's works on speed in the store to get the
pizzas out within 12 or 13 minutes after the order.
   ``We emphasize hustle once they get to the store. But once they
get into the car, there should be common-sense safe driving,''
Hingst said. ``Some people say we're encouraging these kids to race.
But, no, we're encouraging them to hustle. There's a difference.''
   Behrend charged some drivers are given as many as five pizzas to
deliver within about 15 minutes.
   ``That's rare,'' Hingst said.
   He denied that Domino's system, in which mileage and tips
supplement wages, encourages recklessness.
   ``We ask drivers to volunteer to their customers that the pizza
is late and, if they're real courteous about it, they may get a tip
and it may be to their benefit,'' Hingst said. He said the $3 refund
comes from the store, not the driver's pocket.
   Behrend said Domino's encourages drivers to run to and from their
cars, and it awards its top driver an all-expenses-paid trip to the
Indianapolis 500, where the company has a race car.
   ``What is the mental attitude they're encouraging? The model of
that race car sits in a lot of their stores, encouraging the
impression of a race car driver.
   ``That will be a great story when it's time to talk to a jury,''
Behrend said.
   Hingst said the Indianapolis trip was discontinued four years
ago. He said a recent incentive program involving the opening of
Domino's 5,000th store rewarded all drivers with at least 5,000 safe
driving hours.
