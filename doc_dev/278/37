   A man named Noid, apparently annoyed by
Domino's Pizza's ``Avoid the Noid'' ads, held two Domino's employees
at gunpoint for more than five hours before they escaped and he
surrendered, authorities said.
   Kenneth Lamar Noid, 22, told police he thinks Tom S. Monaghan,
owner of the Detroit-based pizza chain and the Detroit Tigers
baseball club, ``comes in his apartment and looks around,'' said
Police Chief Reed Miller.
   Investigators believe Noid was ``having an ongoing feud in his
mind with Monaghan about the `Noid' commercials,'' said detective
Sgt. Mark Bender. ``Apparently, he thinks they're aimed at him.''
   Domino's national TV advertising campaign features the ``Noid,''
a red-hatted, red-caped gremlin who uses every trick he can to make
sure the pizza is not delivered hot and fresh but is never
successful.
   Police said Noid entered the suburban Atlanta store shortly
before 11 a.m. Monday and made one of the employees call police to
tell them he had taken hostages and to stay clear of the area.
   When police arrived, Noid fired four warning shots into the
ceiling of the store, Capt. Dave M. Perkins said. Police did not
return fire.
   ``He said he didn't want to kill them, but if the police came in
he would shoot them,'' Perkins said.
   Noid demanded $100,000, a get-away car, and a science fiction
book titled ``The Widow's Son.''
   He also ordered and ate a pizza.
   One hostage fled the store after 5{ hours and the second escaped
about 15 minutes later while Noid's back was turned, authorities
said.
   Noid gave up minutes later and was charged with two counts of
kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault and theft by extortion
for demanding the $100,000 from Domino's, Perkins said. He was held
today on $250,000 bond.
