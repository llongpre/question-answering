   Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan's
disclosure that he may sell the company comes at a time when the
fast-food concern's fast-rising star may be dimming, an industry
analyst said Monday.
   Domino's, the No. 2 pizza-maker in the nation behind Pizza Hut
Inc., is the leader in pizza deliveries.
   But analysts say the privately held company's sales growth rate
has slowed, and its profit reportedly declined last year from the
previous year.
   ``Domino's has been on such a fantastic growth rate,'' said Gary
Stibel, founder of New England Consulting, a marketing and
management consulting firm in Westport, Conn.
   ``Companies like Domino's cannot continue to grow at their
pace,'' he said.
   Monaghan, who owns 97 percent of the Ann Arbor-based pizza
delivery company, sent a letter last week to about 800 franchise
owners, 16 regional offices and 300 employees at corporate offices
that he is exploring a sale so he can spend more time doing charity
work.
   But Stibel said there may be another reason.
   ``Domino's has become principally concerned about the cap on (the
growth of) this business,'' he said. ``Their share of the total
universe is beginning to start to flatten out.''
   Domino's spokesman Ron Hingst said Monday he knows of no active
sale negotiations. ``He hasn't even made a decision to sell it or
not to sell it,'' he said.
   ``He (Monaghan) has had a number of offers over the years,''
Hingst said. ``Ten to 15 years ago he had an offer from Pizza Hut
and turned it down.''
   Although it is second to Pizza Hut in overall pizza sales,
Domino's is the world's largest in pizza deliveries with 1988 sales
at $2.3 billion. Pizza Hut had overall sales of $3.2 billion in 1988
but only 20 percent to 30 percent of that was for consumption
outside its stores.
   Hingst said Domino's sales have set company records every year
since the early 1980s as the number of its stores grew. Now,
Domino's operates or has franchised 5,200 stores worldwide.
   The company is privately held and does not publicly report its
earnings, but Hingst did not dispute news reports that its profit
fell to $6.1 million last year from $7.7 million the previous year.
   Domino's dominance of the delivery business is being threatened.
   Pizza Hut, with 7,000 restaurants, began a delivery service out
of existing sit-down restaurants and other delivery-only storefronts
in 1985.
   Pizza Hut spokesman Jim Schwartz said from corporate headquarters
in Wichita, Kan., that sales from the delivery stores is growing at
an annual pace of 15 percent to 16 percent.
   Detroit-based Little Caesar's Pizza, with about half as many
stores as Domino's, is the nation's third-largest pizza company and
had sales last year of about $908 million.
   Domino's has been struggling with some damaging news this year.
   Its guarantee of 30-minute delivery has come under criticism for
putting delivery time ahead of safe driving. Domino's conducts
driver safety classes for its deliverers.
   Monaghan has come under fire from women's groups critical of his
outspoken opposition to abortion, and the National Organization for
Women has organized a national boycott of the chain.
   The 52-year-old Monaghan supports the Roman Catholic Church, C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan
School of Architecture. He also founded the Domino's Foundation,
which has supported health-care agencies and educational and
cultural groups.
   He also owns the Detroit Tigers baseball team.
   ``The thought of selling Domino's Pizza is not a pleasant idea,''
Monaghan wrote in his letter. ``I must emphasize that it is only a
possibility at this point.''
