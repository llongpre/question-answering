   Domino's Pizza offered a $10,000 reward
Wednesday in the slayings of two employees who were found shot in
the head and dumped in a back room of the restaurant.
   A third employee was critically wounded in the apparent robbery
Tuesday night at the downtown take-out pizzeria.
   Police investigators say they have few clues and no witnesses.
   ``We're working as hard as we can following up on everything
we've got,'' said Deputy Police Chief Roland Wood. ``The trouble is
we don't have too much to go on right now.''
   An undetermined amount of money was found missing from the cash
register and there were no signs of forced entry into the store,
which was just two blocks from the police station, said Police
Chief James Gabbard.
   ``The way they were shot leads us to believe more than one
person was involved,'' he said.
   To help in the search for suspects, Domino's offered the reward
for information leading to a conviction, and sent four of its
crime-prevention investigators to the scene, said Ron Hingst, a
spokesman for the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based pizza chain.
   ``It's a tragedy when something like this happens because we try
to take every precaution,'' Hingst said. ``We ask that back
entrances be locked, we have a time-delayed safe and we don't keep
that much money around.''
   Investigators have not had a chance to interview victim Matthew
Boornoosh, 27, who was in surgery overnight for the head wound and
remained in critical condition Wednesday at Indian River Memorial
Hospital.
   Killed were Domino's management-trainee Bill Edwards, 27, and
his wife, Frances, 29, employed as a driver at the store, the chief
said.
   The bodies were discovered about midnight when Dan Lawing drove
to the store after waiting more than 45 minutes for the delivery of
his pizza.
   ``The front of the store was dark, but you could see lights on
in the back,'' said Lawing, 29. ``The door was open, so I just
poked my head in and yelled `hello' a couple of times. I knew
something was wrong, so I got the police.''
   ``My heart's still beating,'' said Lawing. ``I just keep
thinking that if I had gotten there just a couple of minutes
earlier, that could have been me shot.''
