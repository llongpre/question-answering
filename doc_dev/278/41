<LEADPARA>  Where's Aretha Franklin's R-E-S-P-E-C-T for Detroit?;   The Queen of Soul will
strut through TV football games starting today belting out in commercials for
pizza delivery. But she'll be singing for Wichita-based Pizza Hut Inc.,
archrival of hometown favorites Domino's Pizza and Little Caesar's.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Franklin will sing "Deliver Me" to the tune of Fontella Bass' 1965 hit
"Rescue Me.";   Pizza Hut spokesman Roger Rydell swears that choosing
Detroit-born Franklin was not a dig. "We hired her because we thought she was
great," he says.;   The campaign is another skirmish in the delivery war
between Pizza Hut and Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Domino's. In just five years of
delivering, Pizza Hut has gained 25 percent of the delivery market, compared
with 45 percent for 31-year-old Domino's.;   The Franklin commercials are tame
compared with Pizza Hut's holiday ads last year that made fun of Domino's
delivery people and enraged Domino's officials.  </TEXT>
