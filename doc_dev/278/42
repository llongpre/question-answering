   ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- When Domino's Pizza Inc. was booming
in the 1980s, founder Thomas S. Monaghan had a $2 million,
two-story office built for himself, with leather floors and a
fireplace.
   But Mr. Monaghan never occupied the suite. Instead, he
works out of a tiny nearby room.

   Last week, Mr. Monaghan, who virtually invented the modern
pizza delivery business when he founded Domino's in 1960,
executed a more dramatic aboutface. He declared that he's
putting many of his prized assets up for sale, including the
Detroit Tigers baseball club, a Lake Huron resort, and a
large chunk of closely held Domino's itself. Domino's says
it's hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to handle the sales.
   For Mr. Monaghan, a devout Catholic who sometimes hands
rosary beads to visitors and donates generously to church
causes, the decision to dismantle his billion-dollar empire
is another chapter in a long, personal odyssey.
   Mr. Monaghan steered Domino's through early financial
problems and emerged as one of the leading entrepreneurs of
the 1980s. He spent his pizza profits lavishly, snapping up
exotic cars, paying $53 million for the Tigers in 1983, and
amassing works by his cultural idol, architect Frank Lloyd
Wright.
   But recently, Mr. Monaghan appears to have intensified his
struggle to reconcile his wealth and his religious
convictions. Two years ago, Mr. Monaghan declared he would
relinquish daily control of Domino's and devote himself to
church work. He tried to sell his company, but couldn't get
the $1 billion to $1.2 billion asking price. Then, this past
December, Mr. Monaghan did another turn. He fired his
handpicked president, David Black, and put himself back in
charge.
   Now, Mr. Monaghan, 54 years old, plans to offer as much as
a 49% stake in Domino's to the public by the end of the year.
It's part of his plan to pass on his fortune to his family
while minimizing estate taxes, says Domino's chief financial
officer, John McDevitt. Mr. Monaghan declined to be
interviewed for this story.
   But the move to take Domino's public comes as the company,
and some of Mr. Monaghan's personal ventures, face tougher
times.
   Domino's and its franchisees have about 5,000 stores and
control 46% of the delivery pizza market. But that's down
from a 56% share three years ago. Meanwhile, Mr. Monaghan has
endured bitter criticism in the Detroit press for his
management of the Tigers, and his bid to get a new, publicly
funded stadium. His resort on Drummond Island was
unprofitable and closed in the fall.
   Now, Mr. Monaghan is looking to give Domino's a financial
boost by selling other assets. Although he probably will book
a loss on Drummond Island, Mr. Monaghan could double his
money on the Tigers. That will help pay down Domino's $160
million in debt, Mr. McDevitt says. To make itself more
attractive to investors, Domino's also took a $41 million
noncash charge last year to cover the closure of unprofitable
stores and took other actions to clean up its balance sheet,
Mr. McDevitt says.
   Domino's has run its business to minimize earnings for tax
purposes, company executives say. Last year it had pretax
earnings of $11.8 million. However, company executive say the
company will report earnings of $40 million to $70 million a
year after non-pizza operations are sold.
   Still, analysts are reluctant to predict what price
Domino's stock would fetch because many financial details of
the closely held company remain unknown. Analysts also
express concern about Domino's competitive position.
   PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut unit is aggressively challenging
Domino's in the delivery business with a better reputation
for quality pizza. Meanwhile, Little Caesar's Enterprises
Inc., a closely held firm based in Detroit, is undercutting
Domino's with its low-cost carryout pizza.
   "Little Caesar's and Pizza Hut define the only two
rational positions that can exist over time, one being the
cheapest and the other being higher quality at a reasonable
price," says Robert Perkins, Pizza Hut's senior vice
president of marketing.
   Domino's is fighting back. In early February, the company
launched a reformulated pizza with more cheese, a thicker
crust and meatier toppings. In a few months, the company
plans to introduce an improved pan pizza, which accounts for
about 65% of Pizza Hut's sales.
   "Pizza Hut has been executing so well the last couple of
years, they've taken share from Domino's," says Caroline
Levy, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. "But if Domino's
gets its act together, they can take it back."
