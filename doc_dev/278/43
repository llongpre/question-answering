   A man named Noid who believed he was the
target of Domino's Pizza's ``Avoid the Noid'' advertising, was ruled
mentally incompetent Wednesday to stand trial for holding two
Domino's employees hostage.
   Kenneth Lamar Noid, 22, of Albany, Ga., could be tried later
under an order entered by Superior Court Judge Curtis Tillman. For
the next 90 days, he is to be evaluated by the state Department of
Human Resources.
   The department ``will decide whether he's likely to become
competent,'' DeKalb County Public Defender Larry Schneider said.
``We don't know at this point what Mr. Noid's prospects are.''
   Police said Noid apparently believed that the advertising
campaign, which features a mischievous animated character called
``The Noid,'' was directed at him.
   He held two hostages at gunpoint for nearly six hours Jan. 30 at
a Domino's Pizza outlet in Chamblee, east of Atlanta, and at one
point fired four shots into the ceiling. The hostages finally
escaped when he turned his back.
   During the standouff, Noid demanded $100,000, a getaway car and a
science fiction novel. He also ordered and ate a pizza.
   Chamblee Police Chief Reed Miller said Noid told police that he
thinks Tom S. Monaghan, owner of the Detroit-based pizza chain and
the Detroit Tigers baseball team, ``comes into his apartment and
looks around.''
   A grand jury indicted Noid on two counts of aggravated assault,
two counts of false imprisonment, one count of possessing a firearm
in the commission of a crime and one count of attempted theft by
deception.
