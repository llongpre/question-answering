   A surge in cheese costs, triggered in part by Uncle Sam,
may bring an end to the prolonged pizza price war.
   Supermarket shoppers also are likely to see cheese prices
climb soon. Two of the country's biggest processors, the
Kraft General Foods Inc. unit of Philip Morris Cos. and
Borden Inc., this month notified wholesalers of price boosts.

   Pizza makers already are feeling the cheese squeeze. For
more than two years they've battled for business by
discounting pies while wooing customers with extra layers of
cheese. "Everybody wants more and more and more {cheese}, so
it puts strains on capacity," says a spokesman for Domino's
Pizza Inc., based in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   But rapidly rising prices for a pizza's most expensive
ingredient -- nearly half the cost in many cases -- could
lead to pricier pies. "It's ushering in a new era of
pricing," says restaurant analyst Caroline Levy of Shearson
Lehman Brothers. "Discounting in pizza will mitigate if
cheese prices continue to increase."
   So far, no one wants to raise prices first.
   "The competition won't let you," says Jim Lewis, director
of procurement at Godfather's Pizza Inc., a 525-unit operator
based in Omaha, Neb. Cheese is costing Godfather's 19% more
than a year ago, which translates into a 9% jump in total
ingredient costs per pizza. "We're not about to jeopardize
quality by reducing our cheese, so there's not a lot we can
do," Mr. Lewis says.
   Nevertheless, if cheese costs remain high, as expected,
retail prices eventually are bound to follow. Already some
restaurateurs have capitulated.
   "We had to raise prices on anything that has cheese," says
Frank Palermo, owner of Palermo's Italian Restaurant &amp;
Pizzeria in Chicago. Cheese now costs him between $800 and
$1,000 more a week. "You've got to sell a lot more pizzas to
make that up," he says.
   Cheese suppliers say they're seeing some pizza-parlor
operators switch to imitation cheese or cheaper blends.
   Already, profits are plummeting. Just last week, National
Pizza Inc., the nation's largest franchisee of the Pizza Hut
unit of PepsiCo Inc., warned investors that earnings in the
current quarter would be down because of soaring cheese
costs. Since spring, mozzarella has gone to $1.65 a pound
from $1.30 -- a 27% jump -- says J.J. Fitzsimmons, National
Pizza's chief financial officer. He holds the government
largely responsible.
   "Guilty as charged," replies John Campbell, the deputy
undersecretary of agriculture who oversees government cheese
purchases. In fact, prices began rising shortly after the
department last May announced intentions to help alleviate
what it called "hardship for our dairy farmers."
   The price of cheese is largely determined by that of milk
-- it takes about 10 pounds of milk (slightly more than one
gallon) to make one pound of cheese. Since spring, the price
paid by cheese plants for milk has jumped nearly 10%, because
the milk supply is shrinking. Low prices earlier this year
forced some farmers out of business, and others complain that
prices still haven't reached profitable levels.
   Among other steps, the government promised to accelerate
cheese purchases for the nation's school-lunch programs. But
perhaps because of that announced intention, prices rose so
fast that the idea has been shelved.
   "We think we've had some impact," Mr. Campbell says. While
he notes that cheese prices typically climb this time of
year, in advance of the high-use fall-winter holiday season,
"the slope is steeper than in the past." Since early this
year, the processors' cost of cheddar cheese, a benchmark for
other varieties, has climbed about 20%.
   Officials say cheese prices last year were "ridiculously
low," as one put it, so that the current increase should have
been anticipated.
   Nevertheless, pizza chains weren't prepared for such a big
jump. As a result, "We'll have to exercise very shrewd
management," says a spokesman for Pizza Hut. Similarly,
Domino's spokesman, acknowledging "some price pressure"
already, predicts more is coming. He says profit margins at a
typical store could fall as much as 25% if current prices
hold.
   Cheese also is a major ingredient in Mexican food. But
while a spokesman for Taco Bell, another PepsiCo unit, says,
"We certainly have seen an escalation in the cost of cheese
in recent months," it has no plans to pass on higher prices
to customers. A spokeswoman for Burger King Corp., the
hamburger chain owned by London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC,
expressed similar vows.
   But consumers will begin to see higher cheese prices at
the supermarket this fall. Kraft confirms it is raising
prices an average of six cents a pound on 70% of its cheese
line. It says that for competitive reasons it didn't raise
prices on its Velveeta loaf and natural-cheese products.
Archrival Borden, citing rising commodity costs, quickly
followed suit.
   Those increases will "filter down to the consumer," says
Roger Robbe, corporate director of frozen foods and dairy for
Super Valu Stores Inc., who says the wholesaler's
private-label cheese supplier also is raising prices.
   For the near term, though, frozen pizzas sold in grocery
stores probably won't cost much more. Grand Met's Pillsbury
Co. unit, producer of Totino's and Jeno's pizza brands, has
no plans to pass on what a spokesman calls the "significant"
increase in its cheese costs.
