   Bad news for recession-watchers: If the state of newspaper
advertising is any indication, the end to this downturn is
still a long way off.
   First-quarter results for major newspaper publishers are
dismal, and the outlook for the balance of the year is more
of the same. Economists predicting a recovery this year
should be forewarned: Industry executives say that newspaper
advertising, a particularly sensitive barometer of the
economy, isn't expected to turn around until the second or
third quarter of 1992.

   "There's no light at the end of the tunnel," says Tom
Ferguson, president of Washington Post Co., whose
first-quarter ad revenue saw a double-digit percentage
decline. Adds Larry Strutton, publisher and chief executive
officer of Denver's Rocky Mountain News, "I think the
situation is worse than the government is letting on -- and I
don't see anything that's going to turn things around."
   Three major newspaper companies -- Washington Post Co.,
Times Mirror Co., and Tribune Co. -- yesterday reported
first-quarter profit declines. And most of the country's
major newspapers saw steep drops in ad linage during the
first quarter, as advertisers shaken by the Persian Gulf war
and the recession stopped spending. At the New York Times,
linage was down 19%; at Times Mirror's Los Angeles Times, it
declined 19.1%; and at The Wall Street Journal, it was off
21.2%.
   "With the Persian Gulf invasion, you could just see it
turning off. Everything came to a screeching halt," says H.
Kenneth Clouse, director of advertising for the Arizona
Republic and the Phoenix Gazette.
   The major weakness is classified advertising, which is off
between 5% and 30% at most newspapers, says John Morton, an
analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan. Help-wanted, real estate
and automotive classified advertising are all off sharply, he
says -- and the economy won't turn around until those areas
start recovering. Classified advertising is the heart of most
papers, accounting for 42% to 45% of the average newspaper's
total ad revenue.
   Newspaper advertising generally improves before a
recession is over, acting as a sort of early sign, Mr. Morton
says. "But we don't see any improvement for this year," he
says. "I think the economists are wildly optimistic."
   Executives said they have seen some small signs of
strengthening since the war ended at the end of February,
particularly in the travel category, which had stopped
advertising altogether. But if the recession were really
going to end this summer as many economists predict, "we
should be seeing some signs now," says Mr. Strutton of the
Rocky Mountain News, an E.W. Scripps Co. publication. He
isn't seeing any, so he's placing his bets on the second
quarter of 1992 instead.
   At The Wall Street Journal, published by Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
Peter R. Kann, publisher and president, says, "Advertising
has picked up somewhat in the Journal in recent weeks, but we
aren't yet touting a trend."
   Other executives were reluctant to predict when their
advertising situation -- and the economy -- will turn around.
At New York Times Co., a spokeswoman says, "We don't see a
turnaround in sight this year" and that "it's too hard to
predict" beyond that. Cathleen Black, publisher of Gannett
Co.'s USA Today, also declines to read the tea leaves. The
newspaper's ad linage was off 8.2% in the first quarter; it
wasn't hit as hard as other newspapers because it isn't as
dependent on classified advertising.
   What optimism there is might best be described as
"guarded." At the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette,
published by Central Newspapers Inc., Indianapolis, Mr.
Clouse says he is encouraged by the arrival of some new local
retailers, but he still doesn't expect ad linage to show a
quarter-to-quarter increase until next year. And Joseph
Ungaro, president and chief executive officer of the Detroit
Newspaper Agency, says he has seen an uptick in travel,
automotive, real estate and national advertising since the
war ended. The agency manages the combined business
operations of Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Detroit Free Press and
Gannett's Detroit News.
   The advertising slide is the real culprit in the poor
earnings results at the country's biggest newspaper
publishing companies. Times Mirror's first-quarter net
plunged 49% to $23.3 million, or 18 cents a share, from $46
million, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Circulation rose in its
newspaper group, but ad revenue for the group slid 12%.
   Washington Post, where ad volume at the flagship paper
fell 23%, posted a 65% drop in earnings to $13.6 million, or
$1.15 a share, from $39 million, or $3.16 a share.
   At Tribune, net fell 37% to $21 million, or 26 cents a
share, from $33.5 million, or 43 cents a share. Tribune said
the 1991 losses at the New York Daily News, which was sold to
Robert Maxwell, were recorded in Tribune's 1990 statements.
   "It isn't getting any better," says Mr. Morton, the
analyst. "Nobody is expecting any fundamental improvement
this year."

   MOVIE PROMO: Paramount Pictures, to promote its slate of
summer movies, released details of a sweepstakes involving
Costa Cruises, Chrysler, Hardee's, Goodyear, Kmart and USA
Network. The studio, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.,
will give out 20 million "scratch-and-win" game cards, mainly
at theaters, from late June through August. Prizes, which
range from Caribbean cruises to ice cream cones, will be
redeemable at the theater or the sponsor's retail outlet.
Cable service USA Network will plug the promotion with spots
during programming.
                                                                                                       

   RESTRUCTURING: CBS Television Network restructured its
sales organization into three units in a bid to "increase
efficiency and improve service to advertisers," the CBS Inc.
unit said. The three units are prime-time and late-night
sales, to be headed by Daniel J. Koby, vice president; news,
daytime and children's sales, to be led by Robert I.
Silverberg, vice president; and sports marketing and sales,
which will continue to report to Harold Trencher, vice
president. All three units will report to Joseph D.
Abruzzese, who was named senior vice president, television
network sales, last month.
                                                                                                       

   PIZZA WARS: Pizza Hut today takes another swipe at
Domino's Pizza in its effort to muscle in on the
home-delivery market. Pizza Hut, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., is
sending a pie to everyone it could find whose last name is
Domino. The pizza chain plugs its ploy with an ad in USA
Today bearing the tagline: "Today, Domino's everywhere will
get a special delivery from Pizza Hut."
