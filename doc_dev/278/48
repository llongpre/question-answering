   A large Pizza Hut franchisee, escalating its dispute with
the pizza chain and its parent, PepsiCo Inc., said it will
switch softdrink suppliers -- from Pepsi to arch-rival
Coca-Cola Co.
   Pizza Hut has gone to court in an effort to strip Arturo
Torres, the principal owner of Pizza Management Inc., of his
franchise. Pizza Hut has said Mr. Torres violated his
franchise agreements when he sued Pizza Hut unsuccessfully in
an attempt to take his restaurants public in 1986. Pizza
Management, based in San Antonio, Texas, has 240 Pizza Hut
restaurants.

   Larry Klenda, an attorney for Pizza Management, said that
if Pizza Hut was "going to continue in this rather ferocious
fight, it was time for Pizza Management to quit using Pepsi
products as a matter of principle."
   A spokesman for Pizza Hut said that, although its
franchisees have no contractual obligation to buy Pepsi soft
drinks, more than 95% of the 7,000 Pizza Huts in the U.S.
serve Pepsi. The switch to Coke wasn't surprising, he said,
adding that Mr. Torres has "been threatening this kind of
action for years."
