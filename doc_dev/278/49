<LEADPARA>  I am writing you concerning a flier I received on my front door. It is a
coupon from Domino's which offers you a free pizza if you order one from
Domino's and Pizza Hut at the same time and the pizza from Pizza Hut beats
Domino's in a race to your house.;    Such an offer is dangerous to the public
safety and, if not borderline criminal, then definitely irresponsible on
Domino's part.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     We live in a fairly quiet, residential neighborhood. One of our street's
most dangerous problems are the pizza delivers who have absolutely no regard
for the safety of others and drive at reckless speeds to deliver a pizza in
less than 30 minutes. On our street we have had several close calls involving
children who have almost been hit by careless drivers. Several pets have been
killed and injured in the last couple of years.;    Guaranteeing first
delivery of a pizza is a disaster waiting to happen. It virtually guarantees
that an innocent pedestrian or driver will be seriously injured or killed for
the sake of a pizza race. The driver will most likely be a young male driver
who is under pressure to win the race for the sake of his job and a tip.;   
Is it worth getting a pizza two minutes faster if this means disregarding
basic traffic safety laws and endangering public safety?;    I hope Domino's
seriously rethinks the intelligence and integrity of this delivery guarantee.
As a large corporation it has an obligation, not only to their stockholders
but to the community it serves, to act in a responsible manner.;    I do not
feel I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. Averting a tragedy will be too
late if this delivery guarantee is retracted after an accident.;    -- David
