<HEAD>Pizza Chain's Founder Says He May Sell Domino's</HEAD>

   The chairman of Domino's Pizza Inc. says
he may sell the company he founded in 1960 and built into the
nation's largest pizza delivery chain so he can devote more time to
charity work.
   ``I am in a position to help various charities that I deeply
believe in,'' said Tom Monaghan in a letter last week to corporate
employees and franchise owners. ``I have discovered that this is a
very big job and it is not fair to give divided attention to
Domino's Pizza and my foundation work.''
   The letter was sent to 800 franchise owners, who own about
two-thirds of the more than 5,100 Domino's stores in 17 countries.
It also went to Domino's 16 regional offices and to about 300
employees at its Ann Arbor headquarters.
   ``They haven't put a value on the company and I think that's what
he meant by exploring the possibility of a sale,'' Domino's
spokesman Ron Hingst said Sunday. He emphasized that a sale is only
a possibility, but said, ``We felt we owed the employees and
franchisees a letter.''
   Domino's, a privately held company, is the world's largest pizza
deliverer. Its sales reached a company-record $2.3 billion in 1988.
Its net income fell to $6.1 million from $7.7 million in the
previous year, according to news reports that Hingst did not dispute.
   Monaghan, who also owns the Detroit Tigers, supports the Catholic
Church, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor and the
University of Michigan School of Architecture. He also is the
founder of the Domino's Foundation, which has supported health-care
agencies and educational and cultural groups.
   ``The thought of selling Domino's Pizza is not a pleasant idea,''
Monaghan wrote. ``I must emphasize that it is only a possibility at
this point.''
   Monaghan, 52, remains chairman and chief executive officer of the
company but gave up running day-to-day operations earlier this year.
He holds about 97 percent of the stock in Domino's.
