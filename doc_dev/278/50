   The mother of a Domino's Pizza driver who
was killed when his truck crashed has made a video for Domino's
franchise holders asking them to consider the hazards their drivers
face trying to beat the clock.
   ``It's really to make an impact on them, on the danger aspect
and the safety aspect,'' Suzanne Boutros said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Boutros said she agreed to make the video when she and the
pizza-maker came to an understanding after they ``agreed to
disagree'' about the company's 30-minute delivery guarantee that
she has campaigned to have scrapped.
   The video was shot at her home last weekend in anticipation of
the company's annual meeting of franchise owners in Detroit this
week, but spokesman Ron Hingst said it could not be edited in time.
Instead, it will be used as part of training materials for the
company based at Ann Arbor, Mich., he said.
   The video evolved out of talks Mrs. Boutros has had with company
officials since the June 3 death of her son, Jesse Colson, 17.
   His company-owned truck hit a utility pole along a wet highway
near Mooresville, southeast of Indianapolis. He was delivering a
pizza at the time, and his mother believes the pressure to get it
to the customer on time contributed to the accident.
   ``Domino's contacted me and we sat down and had some
discusssion,'' said Mrs. Boutros, a resident of suburban
Plainfield. ``They had mentioned that (the video) as a possibility,
and would I be interested? I thought it was some way I could make a
contribution.
   Mrs. Boutros said the small amount she was paid for making the
video would be used to buy a marker for her son's grave. She would
not say how much she was paid.
   ``The people I have talked to are very sincere,'' Mrs. Boutros
said. ``That was a big factor why I decided to go ahead and work
with them.''
   Domino's has started an advertising campaign in which 21 million
box lids are printed with a safety message from company President
Dave Black.
   In his message, Black says a Domino's pizza is usually ready for
delivery within 12 minutes of receipt of the order. That leaves
drivers 18 minutes to get to a customer's home. Delivery areas
average two miles or less, Black says.
   ``Incidentally, if for some reason we miss our 30-minute
guarantee, we pay the $3 refund, never the delivery person,'' Black
adds in the message.
   Domino's also asks its customers to call a toll-free number to
report driving incidents involving company employees.
