   Pizza is great in 30 minutes, but better late
than never, says a highway patrolman who has been lecturing
delivery drivers on how to arrive with pizza and driver in one
piece.
   Managers of the 35 Domino's stores in the Pittsburgh area
suspended their delivery service for four hours Tuesday night so
drivers could listen to Mississippi state trooper Lt. Pete Collins.
   ``I don't know a thing in the world about selling pizzas, but I
do know one subject better than anyone in this room,'' Collins
said. ``That's dying.''
   Critics say the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's guaranteed
half-hour delivery has caused accidents by encouraging employees to
drive recklessly. Company officials admit haste has contributed to
some fatal accidents.
   Attorney Kenneth R. Behrend, who is representing a couple
injured when a Domino's car collided with their car, said the
company should drop its guarantee.
   ``It was a great public relations gimmick. It got them their
market share,'' said Behrend, president of the American Trial
Lawyers Association. ``But ... it is causing more problems to the
American public than are needed.''
   Behrend said he knows of 140 accidents where victims or their
survivors have filed suit, are preparing to file suit or are trying
to negotiate a settlement.
   ``We probably have a perception problem,'' said Domino's
spokesman Ron Hingst.
   ``Most people don't know that you can have a pizza out and fully
cooked in 8 to 12 minutes, and that leaves time for driving. If
there's a way we can save 10 seconds in the production of the
pizza, we'll do it,'' he said.
   Hingst said in 1988, half of the 20 accident deaths involving
company drivers had nothing to do with Domino's guarantee.
   Domino's defends the guarantee, which helped spur its explosive
growth in the 1980s. The policy, established in 1973, says if a
pizza is delivered late, Domino's will refund a minimum of $3.
   The company bills itself as the world's largest pizza delivery
company. It sold 250 million pizzas in 1989, posting $2.5 billion
in sales, Hingst said.
