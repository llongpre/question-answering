   His baseball team is beating up on the
New York Yankees, his classic car collection is growing, and his
quick-delivery pizza empire is pushing a billion dollars in annual
sales.
   To say that all is right in Thomas S. Monaghan's world these
days is a bit of an understatement.
   The 51-year-old Monaghan, listed by Forbes magazine as one of
the 400 richest Americans, is a man of many passions and the money
to pursue them _ thanks mainly to his pizza.
   Domino's Pizza Inc., billed as the world's largest pizza
delivery company, has grown from one Ypsilanti pizza store in 1960
to a 4,279-store operation with $883.8 million in revenues last
year.
   Monaghan's share of the operation, estimated by Forbes at about
$300 million, has given the one-time seminary student the dough to
live out several of his youthful fantasies:
   _He never became an architect, but the influence of his idol
Frank Lloyd Wright is apparent in the buildings at Domino's
300-acre headquarters complex.
   _He wanted to be a baseball shortstop when he was a kid. Now, he
owns a team, the Detroit Tigers, that was leading the American
League's East division at midseason and boasts the league's
All-Star shortstop _ Alan Trammell.
   _His devotion to architect Wright also extends to a collection
of classic cars, two of which were once owned by Wright. In
addition, Monaghan collects Wright-designed furniture, the crown
jewel of which is a dining table and chairs purchased for $1.6
million.
   _Monaghan is even starting his own subdivision on the outskirts
of Ann Arbor, with a Robert Trent Jones golf course and a
requirement that houses be designed by architects from a list of 30
drawn up for him by a panel of architectural experts.
   The first house _ for himself, wife Marjorie and their four
daughters _ will appropriately contain ``the very best of
everything,'' he says.
   ``No regrets,'' he said of his decision to pursue pizza over
architecture some 30 years ago. ``I think it's more fun being a
client, a patron. It's a hobby rather than a vocation.''
   Monaghan's success has allowed him to do _ and buy _ almost
anything. He reportedly spent $53 million to buy the Tigers in
1983, and his car collection includes an $8.1 million Bugatti
Royale among other gems.
   ``It was the best car in the world,'' he said. ``It was in the
Rose Bowl Parade with Gregory Peck riding in it.''
   Somehow he finds the time to keep expanding Domino's, the
nation's second-largest pizza company after Pizza Hut, and the
largest delivery operation.
   It all started when he and his brother, James, borrowed $500 to
buy the little Ypsilanti outfit. Still a freshman in college,
Thomas soon decided to quit school and traded a Volkswagen for his
brother's share of the business. The expansion began almost
immediately.
   Domino's opens about 50 stores a month in the United States and
eight foreign countries. Monaghan says sales are 7 percent ahead of
last year, and Domino's accounts for half the pizzas delivered in
the country.
   Despite the owner's fancy tastes, business at Domino's stays
pretty basic.
   ``It's the same old operation. Pizza only,'' Monaghan said.
   But there are innovations, such as ``mystery customers.'' The
company pays more than 8,000 people _ two per store _ to
anonymously buy a pizza a month and file detailed reports on the
pizzas and the delivery service, which is promised in 30 minutes
from the time the order is taken.
   Many stores offer $3 off if the pizza is late.
   With thousands of drivers delivering pizza to all kinds of areas
day and night, the business has its problems. The biggest is
security, followed closely by driver safety.
   The company has established a security force, based in its 13
regional offices, that pursues investigations when company stores
or drivers are robbed.
   Monaghan insists that speeding delivery drivers are not a
problem, contrary to some legal claims accusing them of causing
accidents. He said people tend to sue the company because of its
deep pockets.
   ``I found out when I first got in the business that driving over
the speed limit doesn't help you get the pizzas there any faster.
You're just stepping on the gas and putting on the brakes at the
next light,'' he said.
   Domino's has its challengers, such as companies promoting
hamburger delivery, but Monaghan has already tried and given up on
that idea.
   ``It's too small a ticket item, for one thing. And there's too
much variety. Every order's different. I just don't think you can
do it profitably,'' he said.
   Monaghan has learned many lessons the hard way. He grew up as a
foster child and was tossed out of seminary school in Grand Rapids
for bad behavior.
   ``They kicked me out of 10th grade. For mischievousness. They
told me I didn't have a vocation,'' he said.
   He later went to live with an aunt in Ann Arbor, graduated from
St. Thomas High School there, and enrolled briefly in Ferris State
College before leaving to join the Marines. After his time in the
service, he returned to Ann Arbor and enrolled in the University of
Michigan for a short time.
   His hard-knocks upbringing perhaps inspires some of the
straight-laced rules at Domino's, which in addition to cracking
down on the speed limit also requires male employees to keep their
hair cut above the collar.
   And Monaghan's religious roots still provide spiritual balance
for his own fast-lane approach to life. He was instrumental in
founding a growing international group of Catholic corporate chief
executives with at least 50 employees and $4 million in annual
sales.
   Legatus, Latin for ambassador, holds meetings that feature a
dinner, a speaker and a Mass.
   ``The purpose is to have the members be better Catholics and
more ethical business people,'' said Monaghan, hinting at the
strains of his considerable ambition.
   ``The businessman who has a sizeable organization and he's the
head of it, he has a lot of unique problems and a certain kind of
loneliness.''
