   WHAT RECESSION? Some franchisers boldly expand.
   While some franchisers put growth on hold, others think
it's time to invest, at least for them. "Everything's up --
advertising, capital spending," says Gary L. Copp, president
of Speedee Oil Change Systems Inc., Metairie, La. Speedee,
whose overall budget for 1992 has increased 30% from last
year, says its headquarters staff has grown to 20, from 12 a
year ago. Mr. Copp says U.S. consumers are keeping cars
longer-so they'll have to take care of them more. Speedee,
meanwhile, aims to start its first foreign operations, in
Brazil, Mexico and Taiwan.

   Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
says it and franchisees in 1992 will again add more than 400
video stores, exclud- ing acquisitions. Despite the poor
economy, it says same-store sales are rising. Sbarro Corp., a
Commack, N.Y., operator and franchiser of Italian
restaurants, recently added its first four managers devoted
to franchising. Sbarro sees "a good opportunity throughout
the '90s," as an aging population seeks alternatives to
burgers, says Frank Montano, senior vice president.
   Maaco Enterprises Inc., a King of Prussia, Pa., franchiser
of auto-repair shops, has increased its franchise-sales force
to eight, from six. Anthony A. Martino, president, says,
"When you have a lot of middle-level people laid off, a lot
more people are looking for their own business."

   PIZZA HUT may buy out Arturo Torres, ending a legal flap.
   PepsiCo Inc. and its Pizza Hut Inc. unit are negotiating
with Mr. Torres, one of the nation's best-known Hispanic
business owners, to buy the approximately 240 Pizza Hut and
Taco Bell franchises held by Pizza Management Inc. The
company, whose sales approach $150 million a year, is owned
principally by Mr. Torres, a Cuban immigrant who began at
Pizza Hut as a dishwasher in 1965. His attorney, L.D. Klenda
in Wichita, Kan., says: "The parties are actively engaged in
discussions," over the possible sale of the franchises. He
declines to comment on possible terms. But industry people
value each Torres franchise at about $500,000 or more.
   A buy-out would end an acrimonious battle. Mr. Torres
attempted to take his restaurants public in 1986 -- a move
that Pizza Hut opposed because more than 50% of Pizza
Management stock would have been sold, thus diluting control
of the franchise operation, according to Pizza Hut. Mr.
Torres sued the franchiser over its restrictions on public
offerings. Countersuing in Wichita federal court, Pizza Hut
seeks to revoke Mr. Torres's pizza franchises.
   A spokesman for PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y.,
confirmed that the talks are taking place.

   NEW COURT RULINGS add to confusion over no-compete
clauses.
   Within limits, some courts back franchisers who attempt to
block former franchisees from turning into direct
competitors. For example, a federal court in Houston late
last year ruled in favor of Meineke Discount Muffler Shops
Inc. in a dispute with former licensees Wesley and Marion
Jaynes of Houston. Chief Judge James De Anda said the
Jayneses had breached a covenant not to compete with Meineke;
they operated a muffler shop within a year of breaking away
from the Charlotte, N.C., franchiser. In November, the court
ordered the couple to pay $7,430 in damages -- plus more than
$570,000 to cover Meineke's legal costs.
   But many noncompete clauses in franchise contracts are
toothless tigers because of differing state laws; some courts
refuse to enforce them. David J. Kaufmann, a New York lawyer,
says covenants not to compete are illegal in California. In
federal court in San Francisco, franchiser Snelling &amp;
Snelling Inc. of Sarasota, Fla., was prohibited last year
from enforcing a noncompete agreement against California
former franchisees who operate personnelservices businesses.
In New York, however, such covenants "are enforceable if
they're reasonable in time and geographic scope," Mr.
Kaufmann says.
   "It's an extremely confusing situation right now for
franchisers and the franchise bar," the attorney adds.

   MILITANCE GROWS among franchisees at yet another chain.
   Worried franchise owners at Little Caesar Enterprises
Inc., a huge, rapidly growing pizza chain based in Detroit,
have formed a franchisee group, A.L.C.F. Inc., hoping to
influence the franchiser. Gary G. Smith, a northern Florida
franchisee, says a major concern is the spread of Little
Caesar pizza to new restaurants inside Kmart Corp. stores,
under a joint-venture pact set last May. That program --
expected to reach 400 Kmarts by summer and more later --
already hurts many existing franchises near the first 150
Kmarts to sell pizza, Mr. Smith says. Weekly sales for one
such California outlet have plunged to $8,000, from $13,000,
he adds.
   "Franchisees are very, very scared about their future
growth and incomes," Mr. Smith says. Momentum to form
A.L.C.F. began building in 1990 when Little Caesar increased
-- to 4% of revenue, from 3% -- the amount it takes from
franchisees for national advertising. It also receives
royalties equal to 5% of revenue. Now franchisees want a say
in how the ad dollars are spent, Mr. Smith says. A.L.C.F.,
which says 70 of the company's 500 franchisees have joined
it, holds its first formal meeting Sunday, in Las Vegas, Nev.
   A Little Caesar spokesman says, "We would never do
anything to hurt our franchisees." He adds that the Kmart
program has had "no negative, only positive" effects -- such
as making the pizza more widely known to consumers.

   BRIEFS: Sales for franchised businesses in the U.S. rose
6.1% last year to $757.8 billion, or more than 35% of total
retail sales, according to industry figures. . . . Sunny Palm
Desert, Calif., is the site of the International Franchise
Association's convention next month.
