When Peter Boizot brought authentic Italian pizza to Britain in the
mid-1960s some early customers suggested he put chips on the Pizza Express
menu. Others mistook the oregano for grass.
But Boizot stood firm and ultimately his recipe for high-quality pizzerias
proved a classic marketing success. From a single Soho restaurant in 1965
the Pizza Express chain has grown to include 68 company-owned and franchised
restaurants which generated Pounds 1.5m in operating profits on turnover of
Pounds 16.3m last year and sold 6.5m pizzas.
Today its shares will begin trading on the stock exchange for the first time
following a complex reverse takeover by the publicly quoted Star Computer
group worth almost Pounds 15m.
Mintel, the independent market researchers, said in a report last autumn
that since 1987 the size of the pizza/pasta market in the UK has more than
doubled to an estimated Pounds 694m last year.
Pizza Express has become Britain's most popular pizza chain despite spending
little on advertising. Instead it has relied on its predominantly upmarket,
loyal customers to spread the word.
Along the way Pizza Express has succeeded in trouncing a handful of
look-alike rivals including Pizza Hut, the market leader in terms of
outlets, PizzaLand and Deep Pan Pizza. So what is the secret?
David Page, who ran the largest group of franchised Pizza Express
restaurants and is managing director of the new publicly quoted group,
believes the success is due to Boizot's refusal to compromise on quality or
authenticity.
For example, Boizot insisted on using real Italian pizza ovens which provide
a very hot, dry heat. The Pizza Express interiors have all been designed by
Enzo Apicella to exploit the character of each individual building.
Similarly the menu has changed little in the last 28 years - even the
introduction of cappucino coffee machines has been resisted - and only
genuine mozzarella cheese and Italian tomatoes are used.
Robert Bird has been in charge of food quality control for 14 years and the
group runs a 'secret eater programme' designed to check everything from
quality of food and service to the tiling in the toilets.
Aside from pizza, Boizot's other passions include Venice, hockey and jazz,
all of which have become associated with the group. More than Pounds 300,000
has been donated to the Venice in Peril appeal fund from a 25p surcharge on
Pizza Veneziana.
It might be tempting for Pizza Express's new management to try to squeeze a
few more margin points out of the business by scaling down some of these
activities, or tinkering with the formula.
But Page, Luke Johnson and Hugh Osmond, who put the Star Computer deal
together, insist there are no plans for change. 'It has been successful
because it is authentic,' says Page.
