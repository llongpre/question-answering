   Domino's Pizza Inc. says it will trim
jobs and cut back health benefits in a cost-cutting effort that was
stepped up when founder Tom Monaghan said he might sell the pizza
delivery company.
   Domino's will lay off nearly 100 employees in departments
including public relations, accounting, legal and video at its Ann
Arbor headquarters and 13 offices throughout the country, spokesman
Ron Hingst said Tuesday.
   Costs of health care benefits, now paid by the company, will be
shared by employees. Hingst said he didn't know how much the
employees would have to pay.
   ``This is based on an ongoing review of the business plan that
will guide Domino's Pizza into the next decade,'' company President
Dave Black said in a letter mailed Tuesday to employees.
   The company decided in 1987 to cut costs and stepped up the
effort recently when Monaghan announced he would consider selling
the privately held company to focus on charity work.
   Dominos, the second-largest pizza company after Pizza Hut,
employs about 40,000 people worldwide, and said it earned $6.1
million last year on sales of $2.3 billion.
