   Stacy McIntire and her visitors wanted
something with cheese and sauce, so they did the obvious thing at a
not-so-obvious place.
   They went out for pizza - at McDonald's.
   ``We had company over and we fed four people on two pizzas for
something like $12,'' she said. ``We went to the drive-through and
didn't even have to get out of the car. We got it in five
minutes.''
   Pizza, in the land of all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce,
cheese, pickles, onions and sesame-seed buns? Is this a fast-food
induced nightmare?
   Not at all. McDonald's, which for years counted its hamburger
sales in the billions, may soon be counting pizza, pasta and other
non-traditional offerings in an attempt to boost sluggish U.S.
dinner sales.
   Owensboro's four Golden Arches and 10 others across the Ohio
River in Evansville, Ind., are among 240 restaurants nationwide
which are test-marketing tomato pies. The 12-inch pies also are
being tested in Las Vegas; Hartford, Conn.; Fresno, Calif.; and
suburbs of Chicago.
   Fresh carrots and celery sticks are being test marketed in
Pennsylvania and California, and McDonald's also is experimenting
with fresh fruit and soups.
   ``Our customers are interested in a little more variety and more
choices,'' said Melissa Oakley, spokeswoman at McDonald's Corp.'s
Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters. ``But we have to be very careful in
what we choose. We're still committed to serving a limited menu.''
   McDonald's, held up by many as a model American corporation, has
long been committed to test marketing. Salads, the McDLT and
Chicken McNuggets made the grade; the Hulaburger, two slices of
cheese with a slice of grilled pineapple on a toasted bun, did not.
   Ms. Oakley noted that McDonald's tested salads for 10 years
before introducing them in all of its 8,500 U.S. restaurants.
   But Michael Mueller, a Montgomery Securities Inc. analyst who
specializes in restaurants, says McDonald's has reasons to press
ahead with pizza now - investors' complaints about the company's
recent U.S. sales growth.
   A pattern of progressively weaker domestic sales growth began in
1988 after peaking at 11.6 percent in 1987. A selloff of the
company's stock followed release of second quarter results showing
domestic sales of $6 billion for the first half of 1990, a
3.3-percent increase from the first half of 1989.
   ``From their standpoint they have to do something to boost
dinner sales,'' Mueller said. ``This (pizza) is better than
nothing.''
   But is it better than Tony's, or Vito's, or Sal's?
   ``If you like pizza, it's just not right,'' said Elaine Lillpop
of Rockport, Ind. ``It's a hurry-up job.''
   She complained that the pepperoni pizza she bought in Owensboro
tasted burned and didn't have enough cheese. Her 8-year-old
daughter, Kari, said she didn't like it either.
   Gail Thompson of Owensboro said she won a free pizza and liked
it, but wouldn't buy another.
   ``I love pizza but I don't particularly like eating it in this
atmosphere,'' she said between bites of a burger. ``It's not fast
food to me.''
   That, says Mueller, is the problem. Pizza doesn't follow the
rules that helped make McDonald's the world's largest restaurant
chain.
   ``In the past they've been successful introducing products that
are cheap, easy to eat, and come with quick service at the
drive-through window,'' said the San Francisco-based analyst.
``Pizza is expensive, hard to eat in the car, and takes five
minutes or more to get.''
   Pizza also requires special ovens and is more difficult to make.
And there are lots of competitors already established in the pizza
market, Mueller said.
   Another restaurant analyst, Roy Burry of Kidder Peabody in New
York, acknowledged the problems. But he expressed confidence that
McDonald's would find a fast-food pizza that works.
   ``They've been on track for five or six years with this,'' he
said. ``It takes a long time to get it right, which of course they
will.''
   Pizza was a logical choice, Burry said. The demand for more
traditional fast food is not keeping pace with the number of new
restaurants, he said.
   ``Pizza is the only fast food product that's growing,'' he said.
``It's a mammoth market. It offers major potential for them.''
   Burry predicted the pizza might be ready for a national rollout
within two years. The test likely will be expanded to more markets
next year, he said.
   Ms. Oakley said McDonald's has not yet decided the product's
fate.
   She said pizza is doing ``very well,'' although the company
won't discuss sales figures. Pizza Hut, the largest pizza chain,
maintains that McDonald's holds only 2 percent of sales in the
Owensboro-Evansville market.
   Evansville workers said sales have been sporadic. A cheese pizza
recently sold there for $4.99. The Deluxe, with cheese, sausage,
pepperoni, green peppers, onion, tomato and mushrooms, sold for
$7.99. Some restaurants sell pizza only after 4 p.m.; some offer
quarter-pie slices for lunch.
   The Owensboro restaurants lure pizza buyers with glass windows
that allow customer to watch sausage and pepperoni being spread by
hand. But they don't see dough lovingly kneaded and tossed.
   McDonald's sacrificed fresh dough for frozen in its attempt to
make pizza a fast food. Some customers say the dough will be the
pizza's downfall.
   ``It tastes like cardboard,'' said 16-year-old Josh Hamburg of
Owensboro.
