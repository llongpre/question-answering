Thomas Monaghan is a postmodern American entrepreneur. Where the old-style 
capitalist built railroads, made steel and dug for oil, the contemporary type 
produces nothing durable. Ray Kroc's McDonald's is the best-known of the 
postwar fortunes made from the new service economy. Fast food is more 
profitable than steel and a lot cheaper to produce. Monaghan's Domino's Pizza 
business grew from one store in Ypsilanti, Mich., run by him and his brother in 
1960, to a vast pizza empire. Gordon Bugbee's "Domino's Mansions" describes the 
chairman's self-conscious transformation from college dropout to a significant 
patron of American architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The story has been told at least once before. Monaghan and Robert Anderson 
chronicled the company's history in "Pizza Tiger" (1986). Why another book? 
Bugbee, described as a "Harvard-trained architect," has assembled a strange 
mixture of fact and legend in this beautifully illustrated book. He struggles 
to integrate the pizza baron's business success with his obsessive interest in 
Frank Lloyd Wright. Monaghan has bought houses, furniture and drawings of the 
architect. His new Ann Arbor corporate headquarters houses his collection in 
what he calls The National Center for the Study of Frank Lloyd Wright at 
Domino's Farms. But he is no ordinary collector. Monaghan has gone a few steps 
further and, in effect, hired Wright as a posthumous collaborator for Domino's 
ambitious building program. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering pizza in fewer than 30 minutes was the corporation's great 
conceptual breakthrough. Hiring Gunnar Birkerts, a competent modernist 
architect, to adapt some of Wright's unbuilt projects, specifically the early 
prairie-style McCormick House and his Golden Beacon, a 1950s tower on Chicago's 
Gold Coast, made Domino's an oddball mixture of art patron and corporate 
booster. Bugbee finds nothing unusual in any of this. 
</P>
<P>
He humorlessly recalls the story of how Wright's Taliesin Fellowship was asked 
to unearth the master's moribund plans for the Golden Beacon. Monaghan's grand 
plans for Domino's Farms call for a tower rising above both the Michigan 
flatlands and Birkert's low-slung Prairie-esque buildings. Bugbee's tone is 
ever respectful: "Tailoring the Golden Beacon to the needs of Domino's Pizza 
risked diluting the majesty of the concept. The company wanted a 30-story tower 
instead of the original 50-plus. (The number 30 has canonical meaning to 
Domino's Pizza; company policy insists that a pizza be delivered no longer than 
30 minutes after the order is taken over the phone.)" 
</P>
<P>
Bugbee's use of words like majesty and canonical is typical of the book's 
overinflated rhetoric and a key to its essential dishonesty. Had this work been 
presented as a pure exercise in vanity and self-promotion or just a catalogue 
to Monaghan's remarkable cache of Wrightian objects it might have joined a long 
list of glorified self-presentations from Andrew Carnegie's to Donald Trump's. 
But Bugbee is involved in a serious confusion of motives. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to mind-numbing portraits of Monaghan, Birkerts and a gaggle of 
Domino corporate officers, he offers a condensed history of modern American 
architecture. This is a confusion further encouraged in a foreword to the book 
by Yale's celebrated architectural historian, Vincent Scully. He too joins the 
uncritical celebration of the chairman's love of the automobile, the land and 
all things American. 
</P>
<P>
Domino's includes a working farm next to its Ann Arbor headquarters. Prof. 
Scully volunteers his own imprimatur to establish at least a rhetorical link 
between the Monaghan-Birkerts-Wright project and the more complex history of 
modern architecture. Bugbee goes on at length to insinuate this project into a 
list of acknowledged masterpieces that include Louis Sullivan's Guaranty 
Building (1894), Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower proposal (1922), and Ludwig 
Mies van der Rohe's Crown Hall (1952-56) on the campus of the Illinois 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Scully adds to the list, "When fully occupied by a number of going business 
concerns, and accompanied by its complementary tower, the long, low-rise office 
building between the superhighways will inevitably be read as a bold emblem of 
Broadacre City itself and a glorification of Wright's beloved image of urban 
decentralization along the automobile roads." Wright's Broadacre City was to be 
a democratic experiment out in the country. It was not to be a city owned by 
one man. In real admiration for their subject, Bugbee and Scully twist history 
into an ornament for the top of Monaghan's tree. This kind of gassy promotion 
makes you run for relief under the Golden Arches or to the soft kitsch of the 
red-and-blue dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan should be encouraged in his quest for "quality" and "excellence." His 
Domino's Farms complex is in the tradition of sterile campus corporate 
headquarters pioneered by the General Motors' Technical Center (1951-57) 
designed by the Saarinens with whom Birkerts apprenticed. 
</P>
<P>
Bugbee misses the opportunity to question the assumptions that led Thomas 
Monaghan to locate his business away from the city and in a 19th-Century 
fantasy pastoral of cows and happy workers. One of the illustrations has this 
caption: "The EBA Club is an upgraded cafeteria where all Domino's Pizza people 
may feel at home. Once a month, all Domino's Pizza staff don the uniform of 
pizza throwers as a gesture of solidarity with the franchises." It's this kind 
of goofy stuff that makes this book entertaining. "Domino's Mansion" is neither 
an objective history of Domino's nor American architecture, but more like a 
pizza, a messy mixture of cheese, sauce and dough.
