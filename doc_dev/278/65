 Managing Travel: As travel costs continue to escalate, more companies are 
hiring travel managers, up from less than 10% in 1982 to 30% in 1988. These 
managers work with travel agencies to guarantee the best bargains in lodging 
and transportation. The big hotels and major car rental agencies are open to 
volume discount negotiation, and the airlines, while not admitting it openly, 
will also "work with" companies for lower fares. Midway Airlines, in a bold 
departure from implicit policy, announced publicly in July that it will 
provide, in its words, "long-term packages with discounts based on travel 
volume." Now that the cards are on the table, and as prices continue to rise, 
more companies are likely to get into the game by hiring their own travel 
managers, and then the airlines really will have to deal. (Tampa (Fla.) 
Tribune)

Circuit City Expands: In the midst of an industrywide slowdown, Circuit City is 
expanding rapidly in the Philadelphia area. The area's first four stores opened 
in November, and another four are scheduled to open within a year. The retailer 
of electronic items hopes eventually to have 15 stores in the Northeast, from 
Philadelphia to Atlantic City, where company insiders expect Circuit City to 
gain 15% to 20% of the market. Despite existing chain competition, Circuit City 
looks to its wide selection, knowledgeable sales force and slick presentation 
to help establish the chain in the Northeast. (Philadelphia Inquirer)

Encyclopedia on a Cassette: Franklin Computer Corp., the company that gave us 
the electronic Bible and other hand-held, computerized reference works, has 
plans for a new video tome. It has acquired the rights to the Concise Columbia 
Encyclopedia, a single-volume work, which it expects to produce electronically 
as the first of its kind. Marketing of the new reference work will follow 
tried-and-true channels -- mail order, specialty department stores and college 
bookstores. No date has yet been set for its debut. (Newark (N.J.) Star Ledger)

Trend Toward Premium Liquor: Looking for a holiday gift for the person who has 
everything? Brown-Forman is hoping you'll turn to its bottled libations, 
particularly its pricier premium liquors such as Gentleman Jack, for the 
answer. Retailing at about $20 a bottle, the premium whiskey is targeted at 25- 
to 45-year-olds and those who invest some ego in their liquor purchases. 
Brown-Forman is counting on status-seeking consumers to pull this beverage out 
to impress friends with the taste as well as the price. The company hopes that 
the trend toward premium liquors will continue to pick up steam as exports grow 
and as aging baby boomers pick up dad's drink of choice, as long as it's a 
choice drink. (New Orleans Times-Picayune)

The Pizza Push: In their race to catch up with the burger biggies, pizza 
purveyors are striking out in new directions. A pizza chain in the Southwest, 
Nunzio's, has developed and built its first Nunzio's Express in Albuquerque, 
N.M. This drive-up outlet, which takes up about as much space as a Fotomat 
booth, promises a $1.79 pizza in one minute. Outlets are planned for Denver and 
Phoenix for next year. At the same time, Pizza Hut has taken the cue from 
McDonald's and entered the arena -- literally. McNichols Sports Arena in Denver 
is the first stadium to sell Pizza Hut products, with Detroit and Cleveland 
next on the list. Although it's not expected to be extremely profitable, the 
exposure will be worth millions. (Rocky Mountain News, Nation's Restaurant 
News)

Money for Mementos: Baseball cards are a booming business these days, and the 
cards you kept in a shoe box under the bed may be worth a lot more than the 
sentiment attached to them. Collecting the cards is the fastest-growing hobby 
in the United States, and 30% of card purchases are made by adults, which is 
one reason prices are skyrocketing. The card for San Francisco Giant Will Clark 
when he was a rookie, for instance, went for a nickel in 1986 and now sells for 
$26. Topps, the biggest name in baseball cards and the company that brings you 
Bazooka bubble gum, will introduce its Topps magazine in January, a quarterly 
aimed at the 2 million serious collectors in the country. (Chicago Tribune)
