FT  07 APR 92 / Whitbread takes charge for pub debts

WHITBREAD, the UK brewer and retailer, yesterday announced its 1991-92
after-tax profits would be reduced by Pounds 25m because of 'abnormally
high' charges for bad debts among its loans to recession-hit pubs and bars.
At the same time, the group said it will not invest further in the Pizza Hut
franchise in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, which had been seen as an
area of growth.
The double blow to the group's retailing business knocked 19 1/2 p off
Whitbread's shares which closed at 358 1/2 p. Analysts revised their
estimates of pre-tax profits from Pounds 260m to Pounds 223m-Pounds 230m.
Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief executive, warned five months ago that
the risk of bad debts among its free trade customers - then estimated at
about Pounds 10m - was worsening due to lower consumer spending and the fall
in property prices.
After a review of Whitbread's Pounds 250m loan portfolio, Mr Jarvis said
yesterday, it had been decided an exceptional charge of Pounds 37m would be
needed to cover bad debts. This would reduce after-tax profits  - which
totalled Pounds 151.5m last year - by Pounds 25m.
About 3,000 of its 11,000 free trade customers are experiencing
difficulties. Most of the accounts at risk were opened during the late 1980s
when Whitbread sought new business as property prices were soaring and beer
volumes grew rapidly.
Whitbread's decision not to invest further in the European franchise
development of Pizza Hut, the PepsiCo-owned pizza chain, had been taken
'with regret', Mr Jarvis said.
Whitbread and Pizza Hut International had been unable to agree revisions to
their franchise agreements which Whitbread considered were necessary to
safeguard the long-term interests of its shareholders.
The 45 outlets in France, Belgium and the Netherlands make little
contribution to profits, but were seen as an important source of growth.
'Expansion required a huge investment and we were unable to obtain
satisfactory terms for recovering those assets if at any time we wanted to
quit the business,' said Mr Jarvis.
The two companies are exploring alternative ownership arrangements and
remain committed to their joint venture in the UK which operates 300 Pizza
Hut outlets.
