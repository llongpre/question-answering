   WASHINGTON -- Hungry for pizza? You may want to check into
a Marriott hotel.
   In a move that will bring fast food into some rather
refined settings, Marriott Corp. said it's teaming up with
Pizza Hut in a plan to offer the restaurant chain's pies to
hotel guests. Marriott, which recently completed a test of
the program in one of its San Francisco hotels, said a
minimum of 65 of its kitchens will offer Pizza Hut pizza by
next July.

   Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed. Pizza Hut is a
division of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc.; Marriott
already offers Pepsi products in many of its facilities.
   Marriott said Pizza Hut ovens will be installed in its
kitchens, and employees will receive two weeks of training
from the restaurant chain. Each hotel will have the option of
offering the pies as part of room service, in restaurants and
bars, or as part of a catering service.
