   By the time Tom Monaghan made it official,
Domino's Pizza Inc. employees already knew pizza no longer was the
founder's reason for being.
   Monaghan, 52, rich beyond his dreams, is at a crossroads.
   Church, charitable work and other outside interests are more
important than pepperoni, double mozzarella and guaranteed delivery
in 30 minutes or less.
   ``It is not fair to give divided attention to Domino's Pizza and
my foundation work,'' he said.
   His personal activities _ including work against abortion and
speaking in favor of the Contras in Nicaragua _ also attract
attention to the company he nurtured for 29 years.
   What he had hinted before, he told employees and franchise
holders in a letter earlier this month. Monaghan would consider
selling the company and other personal properties, such as his
antique cars _ an $8.1 million Bugatti among them _ for the right
price. He's keeping the Detroit Tigers baseball team, which he
bought for $55 million in 1983.
   The letter generated a flurry of publicity about the possible
sale _ front-page stories in Detroit's newspapers for several days.
Last week Monaghan stopped talking, and the focus turned to choosng
an investment banker to handle the sale. The low-end estimate of its
worth is $250 million; the high end is $1 billion.
   Monaghan had talked about selling before. In June, he named David
Black, vice president of operations since 1981, as president and
chief operating officer, giving Black most day-to-day
responsibilities while Monaghan retained the posts of chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``I love the day-to-day work at Domino's, but I want to serve the
church more. I always wanted to be a priest,'' he told thousands of
employees at that time via closed-circuit television.
   And, he said then he would consider selling the company if it
would benefit his Domino's Pizza Foundation.
   Monaghan said in a July 1988 interview that pizza wasn't his
first priority even when he started Domino's in 1960 by trading a
car for a controlling interest in a pizza store in Ypsilanti, Mich.,
west of Detroit. His real goal, he said, was an architect career.
   Domino's has grown into the nation's second-largest pizza chain
with 5,100 stores in 17 countries and estimated annual sales of $2.1
billion, figures from the National Association of Pizza Operators
show. Pizza Hut is No. 1 with 7,000 restaurants and estimated annual
sales of $3.2 billion.
   Monaghan has become one of the nation's wealthiest people, using
that money to pursue youthful interests. Forbes Magazine estimated
his net worth last year at $480 million.
   Architecture books line his office shelves and he owns a
collection of furniture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, including a
$198,000 chair, a $264,000 dresser and a dining room set purchased
for $1.6 million in 1987.
   Monaghan's collection of classic automobiles numbers about 300,
including the 1931 Bugatti Royale Berline de Voyage bought in 1986
for $8.1 million and a 1942 Buick Roadmaster convertible that is his
favorite to drive.
   In 1985, he began construction on the 300-acre, $250 million
Domino's Farms headquarters complex in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The company also has a resort on Drummond Island in Michigan's
Upper Peninsula where employees and other guests are housed in a
Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired lodge and entertained on the 173-foot
schooner Domino Effect.
   Monaghan has pursued Roman Catholic church work with equal zeal.
As a foster child, he attended a Catholic school in Traverse City,
and for a time he attended a seminary school in Grand Rapids until
kicked out in 10th grade for misbehaving.
   Now his Domino's Foundation supports a Catholic missionary priest
in Honduras, and Monaghan twice has met Pope John Paul II.
   He founded Legatus, an international organization for Catholic
corporate chief executives that schedules events from dinners with
Mass and a speaker to workshops on business ethics. He said last
year, ``It's the thing that I feel best about of anything I do.''
   Monaghan's conservative Catholic activities have had
repercussions. The National Organization for Women supports a
Domino's boycott because of his financial support for anti-abortion
causes.
   Company spokesman Ron Hingst says the protests don't hurt sales.
Rockwell wouldn't speculate on their impact, though he said outside
activities can distract a chief executive.
   ``It's certainly possible an individual can spend too much time
away from a company,'' he said.
   The pizza business itself has attackers, too. Domino's attorneys
are contending with damage suits by traffic accident victims who
blame pizza drivers hurrying to meet Domino's 30-minute delivery
deadline to avoid giving a $3 discount on the pizza they are
carrying.
   Security is another problem. Carrying money and pizza can make
drivers robbery targets. One driver was killed in 1987 in a
confrontation with gang members in San Bernardino, Calif.
   Monaghan told The Detroit News the sale announcement was based
strictly on personal reasons.
   ``I've got just about everything I've ever dreamed about,'' he
said, ``and the great lesson of that is it's not that big a deal.''
