   Domino's Pizza promises delivery in 30
minutes or less, but some of the nation's neighborhoods are so
violent the company won't let its drivers venture into them.
   ``It's not worth risking a driver for a $10 pizza,'' said Robert
Rutick, night manager for the Domino's store in Irvington.
   At least three Domino's drivers were killed last year.
   Recent incidents such as a driver being robbed of a pizza at
gunpoint and the throwing of rocks and bottles at cars led to the
cutting off of night service to parts of Irvington, just west of
Newark, where some neighborhoods are so dangerous they've never had
any service.
   ``The only times we stop delivery to an area is when there have
been a number of incidents,'' said Rutick.
   Delivery constitutes the majority of Domino's Pizza sales, with
only a small amount of take-out business. Many Domino's outlets
around the nation do not offer any eat-in service.
   In Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, service
is limited to only a few well-lighted areas with round-the-clock
security like hospitals and the Rutgers University campus, said
Robert Lermanis, night manager for a store that serves parts of
Camden and Burlington counties.
   ``Many drivers are leery of delivering into Camden because it's
a high-crime area,'' Lermanis said. ``We couldn't get anybody to
work here if we went into Camden.''
   Customers whose areas are cut off are told they can always come
to the store to pick up a pizza, said Dennis Obert, security
director for the Domino's region that includes Southern California,
Hawaii, Arizona and Nevada.
   One driver was killed in Obert's region last year when three
gang members confronted him after he delivered a pizza in San
Bernardino, Calif.
   John Gomez, night manager for a store in San Bernardino, said
the crime rate in the city 50 miles east of Los Angeles is
``staggering,'' even compared with his native New York City.
   ``Most of my drivers are scared anyway,'' Gomez said. ``But I
understood myself coming from a low-income family that those people
deserve the same service as the rest of the city. We just have to
tell them because of the area we can't deliver at night.''
   Domino's policy is not shared by at least one of the national
parcel delivery services, but they would not normally deliver at
night.
   ``We have no company policy against not delivering to certain
areas,'' said Betty Todd, a customer service agent at Federal
Express' regional headquarters in Memphis, Tenn. ``Our couriers
deliver to the address on the package.
   ``Our couriers don't carry money. It's not like pizza deliverers
who might have $25 on them to make change.''
   United Parcel Service offices in Newark and New York City were
closed Sunday and officials could not be reached for comment.
   In Chicago, Domino's manager Donnie Crown said he won't allow
drivers in certain large areas.
   ``The cops didn't tell us not to go there _ it's just common
sense,'' Crown said, citing incidents where delivery people had
been robbed at gunpoint.
   Ron Hingst, a spokesman for the main Domino's office in Ann
Arbor, Mich., said there was about one security-related incident
for every 400,000 deliveries last year.
   Domino's has a 3-year-old program of having a security director
in each of its 13 regions to teach delivery people and managers
ways to avoid becoming a crime victim.
   Such advice includes being wary of telephone numbers with a
fourth digit of eight or nine, which usually indicates the call was
placed from a telephone booth.
   In some instances, police have posed as drivers to capture
would-be assailants in areas where a rash of attacks and robberies
have occurred.
   However, Obert said, ``Most departments don't have the time.''
   Two people were killed in the company's Southeast region last
year, said Larry Jerue, regional head of security in Atlanta.
   In one case in Vicksburg, Miss., a delivery man was killed after
being robbed of two pizzas and $4. Five people apparently disposed
of the body and spent the money on beer to go with the pizza,
investigators said.
   ``We kind of mirror society,'' Jerue said. ``Violent crime is
going up and, unfortunately, we've had drivers shot and killed.''
