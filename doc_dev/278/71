<HEAD>Human Relations Panel Sues Pizza Chain For Refusing to Hire
Bearded Sikh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Human Relations Commission has
charged Domino's Pizza Inc. with religious discrimination for
refusing to hire a Sikh man, whose religion requires him to wear a
beard.
   The nationwide chain has a policy that all employees must be
cleanshaven, but no Maryland health law prohibits food service
employees from having beards.
   The June 28 commission complaint said that Prabhjot S. Kohli, of
Catonsville, was refused employment when he applied for a job as
manager of a Domino's store in December 1987.
   Herb James, personnel director of LOOC Inc., the Domino's
franchise that interviewed Kohli, said the complaint was ``a slap
in the face to us when we are desperately trying to work things out
with this individual.''
   James, quoted in Saturday's Baltimore Sun, said Kohli knew the
dress code and policies when he interviewed for the job and that he
also was unwilling to work the weekend and night hours required. He
said other company jobs that did not involve contact with the
public were available, but Kohli refused to consider them.
   Kohli, now an engineer with the State Highway Administration,
said he applied for the advertised position of senior manager
because he had 18 years' experience as a salesman. He said he was
not interested in the other jobs.
   In its complaint, filed with the state administrative hearing
examiner, the Human Relations Commission asked that Domino's pay
Kohli for two years of lost earnings and that he be hired as a
Domino's manager. The examiner's office will hold a public hearing
later.
   A week ago, the commission won a case that ordered the
University of Maryland to reinstate and pay back pay to a campus
policeman who refused to shave his beard because of a skin
condition.
   That case, decided by a state administrative law judge, involved
charges of racial discrimination because the skin condition,
pseudofolliculitis bearbae, usually afflicts black men. Men with
the ailment suffer scarring and lesions when they shave.
