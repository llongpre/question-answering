   No sign marks Doskocil Cos.' corporate headquarters here. 
Inside the abandoned hardware store-turned-office building, executives wear open-neck shirts and jeans. 
And after work, its chairman, Larry Doskocil, bikes outside his country home followed by two dogs, three cats and two goats. 

   This unpretentious, bucolic setting in central Kansas seems appropriate for Doskocil's quiet, shy founder. 
But there is nothing shy about Mr. Doskocil's game plan for this modest, pizza-toppings and sausage maker. 
He intends to feed the company's growth through more acquisitions and by developing new products and entering new food markets. 
"We want to be a leader" in food production, the 57-year-old Mr. Doskocil says. 

   He may be on his way. 
Doskocil recently made a $115 million offer to buy Wilson Foods Corp., an Oklahoma City-based pork processor that would increase Doskocil's revenue six-fold. 
His initial offer was rejected by Wilson's board, but 64% of Wilson shares have been tendered. 

   There aren't many more unlikely participants in the fast-track world of takeovers and acquisitions than Larry Doskocil. 
In 1961, he started his company in an abandoned chicken hatchery, slaughtering a hog at night, sleeping on a cot in the plant and delivering whole-hog sausages to stores the next day. 
These days, he remains less interested in finance than in trying out new recipes in his home kitchen and designing equipment for his plants. 

   But the low-key Mr. Doskocil will have more to worry about than new recipes if he succeeds in acquiring Wilson. 
He would then be butting heads with giants like Geo. 
A. Hormel &amp; Co., ConAgra Inc., Sara Lee Corp. and General Foods Corp. Mr. Doskocil says he's ready for that. 
"As we get into new businesses, it will be a different ball game," he says. 
"We may be going from softball to hardball, but we know what it takes to play hardball." 

   His timing is right, say analysts. 
The meat industry is consolidating and reorganizing into slaughtering companies and processing companies, says Kevin Skislock, analyst with Rotan Mosle Inc., Houston. 
"I think there are plenty of opportunities for new players to take advantage of the changes in the industry," he says. 

   Mr. Doskocil has always seemed to have good timing. 
In 1963, he stopped for a late lunch at a new pizza chain, Pizza Hut, in Hutchinson, and overheard the manager muttering about having to cook pizza sausages when he'd rather be with his softball team. 
Mr. Doskocil offered to supply his sausage. 
Eventually, he supplied toppings to many of the fast-growing Pizza Hut chain's stores and other chains as well. 

   In 1982, he decided he needed some liquidity for himself and the senior management, to whom he had given part-ownership of the company. 
He hired William Rogers, a partner then with Peat Marwick, and they planned a strategy to take the company beyond its humble origins. 

   Mr. Rogers contacted the Bass brothers of Fort Worth, who owned a majority of Aeicor, a publicly traded, reorganized New York company with few assets except a $70 million tax-loss carry-forward. 
Aeicor bought Doskocil, giving Doskocil Aicor's tax losses, making Doskocil a publicly traded company and broadening its access to capital. 
In 1986, it bought Stoppenbach Inc. of Jefferson, Wis., nearly doubling revenue to $215 million a year and pulling it into the delicatessen-meats business. 

   But the first big test of the firm's ability to bring its growing ambitions to fruition may be its takeover battle with Wilson. 
Doskocil faces opposition from Wilson, which said its initial, $12.50-a-share bid was too conditional, and from the United Food and Commercial Workers union. 

   The union would have a hard time painting Mr. Doskocil as a heartless capitalist, however. 
An entreprenuer at heart, he encourages other small food manufacturers who may some day fit into his business, supplying them with technical advice, test-kitchens and money. 
And in 1983, he gave $1.3 million of company stock to non-management employees to thank them for helping build his company. 

   Mr. Doskocil doesn't boast about his generosity. 
"We're just trying to pick up the world and shake a few nickels out of it into Hutchinson, Kansas," he says.
