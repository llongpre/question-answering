Pizza Boycott: A group of Detroit Tiger baseball fans trying to preserve Tiger 
Stadium called for a boycott of the Domino's Pizza chain owned by Tigers' owner 
Thomas Monaghan. The Tiger Stadium Fan Club said it took the action because of 
Monaghan's support for the construction of a new, open-air stadium. Monaghan 
came out in favor of a new stadium on Thursday, saying it would be in the best 
interest of Tiger fans.
