<HEAD>State Cites Pizza Shop Owner in Delivery Boy's Death</HEAD>

   The owner of a Domino's pizza franchise has
been charged with violating two state labor regulations and could
be fined $1,000 in connection with a delivery boy's death, state
officials say.
   It is the first time the store owner has been cited in the June
3 death of Jesse K. Colson, 17, of suburban Plainfield. Colson was
making a pizza delivery on a rain-slicked road in Morgan County
when his company-owned truck struck a utility pole.
   His mother, Suzanne Boutros, has criticized Domino's policy of
guaranteeing a pizza delivery within 30 minutes or less, a policy
she believes contributed to her son's death.
   Cross Country Pizza Inc. of Brownsburg, which owns three
Domino's outlets including the one in Mooresville where Jesse
worked, violated two rules of the Indiana Department of Labor,
officials said Friday. Mooresville is 10 miles southwest of
Indianapolis.
   Cross Country owner Steve Osmun did not immediately return a
telephone call placed to his office Saturday seeking comment.
   After Jesse's death, Domino's Pizza Inc. maintained that the
company met a 30-minute delivery guarantee by speedy preparation of
the food at its stores, and did not encourage its drivers to speed.
   In their citations, officials maintained Cross Country ``did not
furnish a place of employment which was free from recognized
hazards that were causing or likely to cause death.'' The second
citation accused the company of failing to promptly report the
boy's death to the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   Cross Country has until mid-December to file an appeal.
   On Friday, Boutros questioned whether a $1,000 fine was
sufficient penalty.
   ``I'm glad to see some action has been taken, but I think that's
a small fine to pay,'' she said.
