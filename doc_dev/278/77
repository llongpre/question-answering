   Domino's Pizza Inc. says it has pulled
advertising from NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' comedy show because
of complaints about objectionable language on a recent episode.
   The pizza chain withdrew four 30-second commercials scheduled
for the show and planned to cancel remaining commercials intended
to be aired during the weekly program, Domino's spokeswoman Kerry
McNulty said Tuesday.
   ``We've had a lot of complaints,'' said Sam Fine, director of
marketing for Domino's.
   A major religious group, the American Family Association based
in Tupelo, Miss., said it had called Domino's attention to a Dec.
28 program in which actors got some laughs by using the word penis
more than a dozen times in one skit, according to the Rev. Donald
Wildmon, executive director of the AFA.
   Wildmon said Ralston Purina Co. and General Mills Inc. earlier
assured the group that they had pulled ads from ``Saturday Night
Live'' after the AFA had called their attention to this skit and
anothger it found offensive.
