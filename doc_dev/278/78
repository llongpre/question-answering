   Pizza Inn Inc. said it signed a three-year pact for
Coca-Cola Co. to supply nearly 400 of the chain's stores with
CocaCola Classic and other Coke products.
   Pizza Inn, Dallas, and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola declined to
estimate the value of the contract. But Jeffrey Rogers, Pizza
Inn's president, said the agreement covers more than 90% of
the chain's 425 stores, as well as "all new stores" to be
built during the contract. Pizza Inn said it had total sales
of about $165 million in 1990.

   Mr. Rogers said the agreement ends a relationship with
PepsiCo Inc., Purchase, N.Y., under which PepsiCo had
supplied a portion of the chain's stores. A PepsiCo spokesman
downplayed the significance of the agreement, saying PepsiCo
had served no more than 25% of Pizza Inn's outlets.
   Mr. Rogers said that Coca-Cola would help Pizza Inn's
marketing efforts and that some franchisees were concerned
about competition from Pepsi's Pizza Hut unit.
