   Pizza Hut will soon join Kentucky Fried Chicken
in bringing American fast food to China's capital.
   The American chain will open China's first pizza restaurant by
the end of the year, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
Thursday. Kentucky Fried Chicken, which opened in November, was the
first Western fast-food chain to open in China.
   The restaurant has been a big hit with the Chinese, who daily
buy the equivalent of 1,300 chickens. Business has been so good
that two more restaurants are planned in Beijing.
   The Amit Co. Of Hong Kong and the Beijing International Services
Co. signed the Pizza Hut joint venture contract Wednesday, Xinhua
said. The Amit Co. Will provide 60 percent of the $6 million for
the project, it said.
   Processing techniques and management expertise will be provided
by the Pizza Hut chain.
   Pizzas are now available in China only in hotels catering to
foreigners. The Pizza Hut restaurant will be the first to serve the
general public.
   The report did not say where the restaurant would be or how much
the pizzas will cost.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken, which has its largest restaurant in the
world in China, is southwest of central Beijing's Tiananmen Square,
overlooking Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum.
