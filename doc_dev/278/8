   Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan
intends to sell not only the nation's largest pizza delivery chain
but also most of the rest of his multimillion-dollar holdings, a
spokesman says.
   Monaghan said last week in a letter to Domino's franchisees and
employees that he might sell the chain to leave him with more time
for charitable work. Monaghan also said the sale could protect the
company from controversy surrounding his outside activities,
including opposition to abortion.
   But there is more on the block, company spokesman Ron Hingst said
Tuesday.
   ``Everything's up for sale _ except the Tigers and his wife
Margie,'' Hingst said. Monaghan bought the Detroit Tigers in 1983,
and the American League club went on to win the World Series the
next season.
   Besides Domino's, which reported sales of $2.3 billion in 1988,
Monaghan owns 3,000 acres of property on Drummond Island in northern
Lake Huron; Domino's Farms, the company's $250-million headquarters
outside Ann Arbor; computer software companies; about 300 classic
automobiles; and about $30 million worth of furniture and
memorabilia by architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
   Domino's has been flooded with calls from investment bankers
interested in helping Monaghan sell the pizza chain, but there have
been no recent bids from buyers, Hingst said.
