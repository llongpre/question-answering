   The introduction of Pizza Hut to Moscow
will also see the introduction of Margy Trcka from little
Coralville, Iowa, to her first taste of life in another country.
   Trcka, manager of the Coralville Pizza Hut, is part of a
five-member team leaving Aug. 1 to train 300 Soviets to make pizza
for the chain's next restaurants.
   ``I've never been overseas. It will be quite the adventure for
me,'' she said. ``It's kind of a mystery. I can picture myself
lying on the beach in Mexico, maybe, but I can't see myself in
Moscow.''
   When she learned last spring that she had been selected from
5,300 managers to make the trip, Trcka enrolled in an eight-week
language class at Kirkwood Community College.
   ``The thing I fear most is the language barrier. My favorite
phrase is going to be `I do not speak Russian,''' Trcka said. The
management team will train Soviet employees through interpreters.
   Pizza Hut, owned by Pepsico Inc., plans to open two restaurants
in Moscow by the end of August.
   One Pizza Hut will be in surburban Moscow and will seat 325
people. ``It's about five times the size of my little Coralville
Hut,'' Trcka said.
   The second will be near the recently opened McDonald's and will
seat about 80 people.
   It won't be the first time Muscovites have been exposed to
pizza. Two New Jerseyites, Louis Piancone Sr. of Newark and
Ukranian-born entrepreneur Shelley M. Zeiger of Moorestown, entered
a joint venture with Soviet officials in 1987 to take the company's
Astro Pizza mobile concession truck to Moscow. The truck began
selling to tourists and Soviet customers in April 1988.
   Trcka, along with managers from Florida, Illinois and New York,
will spend three weeks training the 300 workers selected to staff
the two Pizza Huts from about 6,000 applicants. In Coralville, a
suburb of Iowa City in eastern Iowa, Trcka oversees a crew of 25.
   ``I've heard the Soviet people are very friendly and really take
to Americans,'' she said. ``McDonald's broke some ground as far as
smiling and such. They're getting used to Western culture.''
   But while McDonald's emphasizes fast food, ``We're going to
concentrate more on service and family dining.''
   The restaurants will offer carryout service, ``a totally new
concept for the Soviet Union,'' Ms. Trcka said. ``If all goes well,
they'll consider delivery, too.''
