   After months of persistent negotiations, Interpublic Group
of Cos. has finally landed the sought-after shop that put
jocks Michael Jordan and Joe Montana into underwear
commercials.
   Interpublic yesterday signed a letter of intent to buy
Long, Haymes &amp; Carr, based in Winston-Salem, N.C. With about
$100 million in billings, Long Haymes is considered one of
the best regional shops in the country. Its heavyweight
clients include RJR Nabisco and Sara Lee's Hanes apparel
unit, for which it creates the jock-heavy underwear spots.
Started as a one-man agency in 1949, Long Haymes broke into
the national spotlight in the 1960s by dressing up Joe Namath
in Hanes pantyhose -- and has been competing with the big
guns of Madison Avenue ever since.

   Interpublic plans to fold Long Haymes into its Lintas
unit, though the North Carolina shop will keep its name and
separate identity. The two agencies have a lot in common:
Long Haymes's two biggest clients, RJR and Hanes parent Sara
Lee, are also clients of Lintas, which has billings of over
$1.7 billion.
   The two agencies, in fact, were first introduced earlier
this year by Sara Lee. The big advertiser is gearing up to
take its Hanes line international, but Long Haymes doesn't
have any overseas offices to advertise the brand abroad.
Lintas has an extensive international network and is keenly
interested in acquiring more Sara Lee business.
   "We're going to make {Long Haymes} a lot more competitive,
and they'll afford us the opportunity to drive businesses
internationally. The fit is perfect," said Spencer Plavoukos,
president of Lintas's worldwide operations.
   Terms of the proposed transaction weren't disclosed. But
industry executives believe Long Haymes will receive
Interpublic stock currently valued at about $7 million, with
potential future cash payments of an additional $5 million to
$7 million, based on performance, over the next three to five
years.
   Lintas now becomes a far more significant player at Sara
Lee. The two agencies combined would handle close to $90
million in Sara Lee business, industry executives estimate,
with $60 million of that coming from Lintas and the remainder
from Long Haymes.
   The acquisition could give an even bigger boost to
Lintas's RJR billings. Lintas currently handles just $15
million or so for RJR, primarily for its Planters peanuts
brand. Long Haymes oversees an estimated $40 million of RJR
business, including cigarette brands Doral, Magna, Sterling
and Century, as well as some food products. A spokeswoman for
RJR's tobacco unit said the company was "delighted Long
Haymes was able to strengthen their world-wide position in
this manner."
   The proposed merger calls for Donald Adams, chairman and
chief executive officer of Long Haymes, to report to Lintas's
Mr. Plavoukos. The combination will allow Long Haymes to do
more for clients as the clients themselves grow larger, Mr.
Adams said, adding that "this whole thing was driven by
change."

   Domino's Goes Ordinary
                                                                                                       

   Domino's Pizza takes a deliberately middle-of-the-road
tack in a new campaign breaking next Friday, in the
home-delivery chain's first effort from Grey Advertising.
   The campaign, which introduces a jingle, "Nobody knows
like Domino's how you like pizza at home," focuses on the
pizza itself and real-life eating situations. Domino's
delivery speed -- the hallmark of earlier campaigns -- is
mentioned only in passing. Funky ads like the clay-animation
"Noid" figure of a few years back are a thing of the past.
   The ads bear a strong similarity to much of Grey's work
for packaged-goods clients -- ads that have won the agency
the favor of many clients and the disdain of many in the ad
community. TV spots show lots of close-ups of steaming food
and smiling eaters and make no attempt at cleverness. "The
ads are straight-ahead and honest-looking," said Stephen
Novick, executive vice president of creative services at
Grey, which won the $50 million-plus account from Ross Roy
Group's Group 243 unit in April. "We wanted to get back to a
sense of reality."
   Beaming staffers at Domino's stores also figure
prominently in the ads, since "most people's contact with
Domino's has just been the telephone and the delivery boy,"
said Edward Meyer, Grey's chairman and chief executive
officer. The growing threat from giant Pizza Hut, the PepsiCo
unit that has been muscling in on Domino's home-delivery turf
over the past two years, isn't mentioned. Still, competitive
pressures are visible; the first spots discuss a "Pepperoni
Pizza Feast" promotion, and subsequent ads also are expected
to focus on discounts as well as image.
