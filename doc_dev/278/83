   An assistant restaurant manager fed up with
hordes of teen-agers at her Pizza Hut locked the doors and
collected $1 each from youths unaccompanied by adults, but the
national chain ended the policy.
   Susan Gamlin, manager of the Pizza Hut in Baden, about 15 miles
northwest of Pittsburgh, said her assistant instituted the cover
charge because unruly teens were disrupting the eatery after
football games and high school dances.
   ``We didn't think a dollar was too much to ask from kids who
destroy our dining room every Friday night,'' Ms. Gamlin said.
   ``The kids dump the salt and pepper shakers, only order bread
sticks and water, try to bring in food from McDonald's, don't wait
to be seated and then complain about not having a waitress.''
   She declined to name the assistant, who no longer works at the
restaurant. She would not say whether his departure was related to
the incident.
   Roger Rydell, a spokesman at the chain's Wichita, Kan.,
headquarters, said it was wrong to collect the fee.
   ``There are no cover charges at Pizza Hut,'' he said. ``And
there won't be any locked doors until we close for business for
good.''
   Judy Campbell, whose son, Brian, was one of the youths who paid
the fee Friday night, said she was ``very upset.''
   ``The kids in this area have no place else to go,'' she said.
   Baden Borough Secretary Sue Blum said she contacted Fire Chief
Gene Miketa about parents' complaints. Police Chief Frank Tavern
also was investigating.
