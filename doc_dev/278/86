   WASHINGTON -- Congress, by voting to waive federal
inspection requirements for all meat-topped pizza sold to
nonprofit institutions, has opened up a multibillion-dollar
market for Pizza Hut Inc. and other fresh-baked pizza
purveyors.
   At the same time, approval of the so-called Pizza Hut
amendment is seen as setting a legislative precedent for
tearing down regulatory barriers that have largely thwarted
McDonald's Corp., Taco Bell Corp. and other fast-food giants
from entering the huge institutional market, which includes
the national school lunch program, hospitals, prisons and
colleges.

   The amendment -- denounced by opponents as the biggest
exemption in the 85-year history of federal meat inspection
-- will break the frozen pizza industry's virtual lock on
meat pizza sales to schools and other institutions.
Currently, only frozen pizza meets the longstanding
inspection requirement for all meat products that are
distributed to restaurants or institutions for resale.
   Lobbyists for the National Frozen Pizza Institute argued
unsuccessfully that the exemption will undermine public
health safeguards and unfairly spare fresh pizza makers from
having to spend millions of dollars to upgrade their kitchens
to meet federal standards and from having government
inspectors looking over their shoulders. "The real issue
isn't health and safety," counters William Lesher, lobbyist
for Pizza Hut. "They just don't want any competition."
   Mr. Lesher says pepperoni and other precooked meats on
pizza are twice inspected -- at the slaughterhouse and then
the processing plant -- and don't need further inspection.
Opponents maintain that Congress should have left the
complicated issue for regulators to decide after sounding out
consumer groups and scientists in public hearings.
   The issue has divided the $25 billion pizza industry into
two hostile camps for more than two years. PepsiCo Inc.'s
Pizza Hut unit, based in Wichita, Kan., enlisted the help of
its congressman, Democratic Rep. Dan Glickman, and other
lawmakers after failing to persuade the Agriculture
Department to waive the inspection requirement. The efforts
of Pizza Hut and its industry allies, meanwhile, had
behind-the-scenes support from McDonald's, PepsiCo's KFC Inc.
unit and other companies interested in broadening their
market opportunities.
   Opponents contend that Pizza Hut always had something more
ambitious in mind than its avowed goal -- opening up the
school lunch program to fresh pepperoni pizza made to its
specifications.
   "Look at PepsiCo's annual report," says John Bode,
lobbyist for the frozen pizza industry. "It says Pizza Hut's
marketing strategy is to convert from sit-down restaurants to
a pizza-distribution company."
   As it turns out, the House-Senate conferees gave Pizza Hut
and closely held Domino's Pizza Inc., based in Ann Arbor,
Mich., the kingpins of delivered pizza, access to much more
than the $500 million pizza market for school cafeterias. The
amendment, quietly adopted this week as part of a farm-law
technical corrections bill, directs the agriculture secretary
to issue rules by next August that allow the delivery of
fresh-baked meat pizza to not only schools but to any other
private and public nonprofit institutions.
   Schools alone represent a "potentially enormous business
for us," says Roger Rydell, a Pizza Hut spokesman. "We'd like
to have every one of our {4,000} delivery-capable units
nationwide serving at least one school." The pizza will be
prepared at restaurant locations and delivered to the
schools. The company also envisions a rapid expansion into
the institutional market, he adds.
   By all accounts, there is big money to made. "The
insitutional market is a multibillion-dollar category," says
Howard Miller, government relations manager for Schwan's
Sales Enterprises Inc., a closely held company that sells its
Tony's brand frozen pizza nationwide. "If you just got into
college programs, it's got to be $1 billion," adds William
Birtcil, a vice president of Grand Metropolitan PLC's
Pillsbury Co., which markets several frozen pizza lines,
including such brand names as Totino's, Jeno's and Pappalo's.
   Fresh meat pizza is hardly the first meat product to be
exempted from federal inspection. Pepperoni rolls, dehydrated
beef soup and chicken broth, for example, all have similar
exemptions under the theory that they either contain minimal
amounts of meat or historically haven't been viewed as meat
foods. And now both sides in the pizza battle expect to see
more bids for exemptions.
   "I think there's a fair chance in the next Congress we're
going to see a burrito amendment, a stromboli amendment, a
calzone amendment, a taco amendment and an eggroll
amendment," asserts Mr. Bode, a partner in the Washington law
firm of Olsson, Frank &amp; Weeda.
   Meanwhile, Kellogg Co. didn't fare very well in the
high-stakes cereal battle on Capitol Hill. The company has
been trying for years to open up the Agriculture Department's
nutrition program for women, infants and children to
Kellogg's Raisin Bran. The $150 million WIC market has long
been dominated by General Mills Inc., maker of Cheerios. To
Kellogg's frustration, the department had taken the position
that the sugar in the cereal itself, combined with natural
sugar in raisins, exceeds its nutritional standards for
cereals that low-income women can buy with WIC vouchers.
   The Battle Creek, Mich., company and Sun Diamond Growers,
the big California cooperative that produces Sun Maid
raisins, turned to the Michigan and California delegations
for help in seeking a waiver of the sugar limit. But they
were no match for a political coalition assembled by General
Mills. Congress merely directed the agriculture secretary to
look into the issue and report back by the end of the year,
explaining the rationale for the no-Raisin Bran policy.
   At the same time, the egg industry came away from Congress
with legislation to its liking in the technical-corrections
law -- an egg-safety provision designed to reduce the risk of
food-poisoning outbreaks caused by salmonella enteritidis, a
bacterium. Under the legislation, egg packers and shippers
will be required to store and transport eggs at 45 degrees
Fahrenheit. The Food and Drug Administration has imposed
similar refrigeration requirements on retailers, restaurants
and food services.
   "This will help end unsafe practices such as leaving eggs
on shipping docks during warm weather," says Sen. Wyche
Fowler (D., Ga.), sponsor of the measure.
