FT  24 NOV 93 / Observer: Pizza the action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some companies have learned to their cost that gimmicky promotions can
backfire - viz Hoover's disastrous free flights offer . . .
Pizza Hut, the Pepsico-owned restaurant chain, is possibly now regretting
its latest marketing foray at New York's Madison Square Garden, home to the
New York Knicks, America's top basketball team.
At Knicks' games Pizza Hut is offering free pizzas to everyone in the crowd,
so long as the Knicks' opponents fail to score at least 85 points. This is
quite a gamble, given that every game is a sell-out to a capacity crowd of
20,000 fans, and the Knicks are the best defensive team in the league.
Several times so far this season visiting teams have struggled to make 85
points, putting the heat under those Pizza Hut executives responsible for
the idea. Their personal career version of pizza-to-go almost arrived in
last week's game against Miami Heat.
Thousands of hungry New Yorkers howled 'pizza, pizza, pizza' as the final
seconds of the game against Miami - on a puny 82 points - ticked by.
Miraculously, Miami reached 85 points as the whistle blew.
Pizza Hut executives also blew - a sigh of relief - but it vanished as
quickly as the smile on the face of a New York waiter who sees a tip of less
than 12.5 per cent.
For although the execs had avoided a jumbo-sized payout, their promo had
nevertheless clearly bombed. New Yorkers to the core, the disappointed fans
stopped screaming for pizza and instead started yelling abuse at Pizza Hut.
