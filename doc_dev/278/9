   Thomas S. Monaghan, who rose from a childhood in orphanages to become a multimillionaire fast-food baron, is considering selling his company, Domino's Pizza Inc. 

   Mr. Monaghan has notified employees and franchise owners that he may sell his 97% stake in the nation's largest pizza delivery company. 
Estimates of the price vary widely because the company's profits haven't matched its explosive growth, but guesses run as high as $500 million. 

   In a letter to employees and franchisees, the 52-year-old Mr. Monaghan said selling Domino's would allow him to devote more time to charity work, as well as simplifying estate planning for his family. 

   "I am in a position to help various charities that I deeply believe in," Mr. Monaghan wrote. 
"I have discovered that this is a very big job and it is not fair to give divided attention to Domino's Pizza and my foundation work." 
Mr. Monaghan is an active supporter of several causes including the Roman Catholic Church, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. and the Domino's Foundation, which backs health-care agencies, as well as arts, educational and cultural groups. 

   Domino's officials said Mr. Monaghan hasn't received any offers yet for the company and he hasn't hired investment advisers to determine its value. 
Domino's 17% share of the U.S. pizza market trails only PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut subsidiary, which has a 20.7% market share. 
Domino's has 5,100 outlets world-wide, two-thirds of which are franchised. 

   "At this point, he's only letting people know that he's exploring and evaluating the possibility of selling," said Domino's spokesman Ron Hingst. 

   Industry analysts said the sales price for Domino's could range from about $250 million to $500 million. 
They said it is difficult to determine its precise value because profits have been lean in recent years despite the company's strong brand name. 
During the 1980s, Domino's revenue grew 20-fold thanks to an explosion in demand for home-delivered foods. 
Last year, Domino's topped $1 billion in revenue for the first time. 
But earnings have been lackluster the past three years, falling from $7.7 million in 1987 to $6.1 million last year. 
In addition, the company last year undertook a $5 million cost-reduction program. 

   A number of companies are rumored to have an interest in buying Domino's, with speculation focusing on soft-drink giants Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo. 
Officials of both companies declined to comment, but analysts discounted the value of Domino's to either concern. 
PepsiCo's full-service Pizza Hut chain has already geared up to challenge Domino's in the delivery business. 
Coca-Cola, meanwhile, has shunned moving into the restaurant business and has shown no real interest in competing against restaurant chains that buy its soft drinks. 

   "Any buyer is going to have to recognize that Domino's will soon have to decide how to make its next major growth spurt with additional products," said George D. Rice, chairman of GDR Enterprises, a Chicago marketing and research consulting firm. 

   "It's a good time for Tom Monaghan to take a step like this," Mr. Rice said. 
"Domino's hasn't saturated the market yet and he can get out before the company has to reach for a new dimension." 

   In June, Mr. Monaghan signalled that his involvement with Domino's might wind down when he turned control of daily operations over to Dave Black, the company's first chief operating officer. 
But the thought of Domino's without its founder remained difficult to contemplate. 

   Mr. Monaghan's rags-to-riches story has produced enormous publicity for Domino's, especially after he bought the Detroit Tigers baseball team and wrote an autobiography titled "Pizza Tiger". 

   Domino's and its founder remain as closely identified as McDonald's Corp. and Ray Kroc. 
Many of Mr. Monaghan's outside interests have found expression through the pizza business. 
The company's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich., for example, is inspired by designs by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, one of Mr. Monaghan's early heroes. 

   Other interest, though, have produced controversy. 
Last year, Mr. Monaghan publicly backed efforts to end state-funded abortions in Michigan, putting him in the center of a storm over that issue.
