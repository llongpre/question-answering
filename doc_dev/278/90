   The newest pizza outlet in the state won't
promise delivery within 30 minutes, but the owners have an excuse _
their new shop is a boat.
   The 32-foot ``Pizza Tug O'' is due to make its maiden voyage
Tuesday. It will ply the waters of southeastern Alaska, where
almost every town is on its own island and pizza delivery was out
of the question until Helen and Fred Tallmadge decided that where
there's a wave there's a way.
   The Tallmadges, who came to Alaska on their honeymoon seven
years ago and never went back, opened the first Domino's Pizza
franchise in Juneau in February 1987 and a second shop six months
later.
   Their third shop, the $125,000, custom-made boat, has a top
speed of 14 miles and 17 pizzas an hour. The onboard kitchen has
been specially designed to meet regulations for safe food handling
in restaurants.
   The boat will make weekly voyages from Juneau, population
28,000, to the smaller communities of Haines, Skagway, Hoonah and
Angoon. It also will drop anchor near commercial fishing grounds.
   The landlubbers at Domino's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
Tallmadge said, ``were dubious about it at first. I think mostly
they wanted to protect me. But I was persistent and finally they
approved it.''
   Domino's claims to be the world's largest pizza delivery company
with more than 5,000 stores. Its new Juneau outlet is the only
floating one, said spokeswoman Moira McDermott.
   Tallmadge said he expects to run the pizza boat regularly from
April through October, and there may be some winter runs when
weather permits. Pizzas will be a couple of dollars more expensive
aboard ship than on land, and the company's 30-minute delivery
guarantee will not apply.

   Most sixth-graders work on science
projects, but few receive the results 11 years later from 250 miles
away.
   Barb Spence, formerly of Battle Creek, was 12 years old in March
1978 when she put a note into a baby food jar, sealed it with black
tape and threw the jar into the Elkhorn River.
   The note included instructions to contact her if the jar was
found as part of her sixth-grade science project.
   Over the years, Miss Spence grew up, married and moved to
Tallahassee, Fla. But the jar apparently continued its slow journey
down the Elkhorn, into the Platte River and finally the Missouri
River.
   Last month Bill Jeffrin of Orrick, Mo., found the jar almost
hidden on a sandy shore of the Missouri River southwest of Kansas
City. The note inside was still legible, so Jeffrin contacted Miss
Spence's parents, Lyle and Rosie Spence of Battle Creek.
   ``We couldn't imagine that the note had survived. I thought it
was a joke at first,'' Mrs. Spence said. ``But Mr. Jeffrin seemed
so excited and sincere that we gave him Barb's phone number.''
   At first, Mrs. Spence said, her daughter thought Jeffrin ``was
pulling her leg.'' But then the memory of the project came back.
   ``She thought it was incredible to get the results of that
project so many years later. She was thrilled,'' Mrs. Spence said.
   The find also surprised Loren Kment of Norfolk, the teacher who
assigned the science project 11 years ago.
   Kment, who is now an insurance salesman, said the project was
intended to combine a science lesson on river currents and an
English lesson on communication.
   ``It's wonderful to realize that my lessons are still having an
impact on the students, even 11 years later,'' he said.
