<HEAD>Driver Training Took a Bite out of Domino's Pizza Profits</HEAD>

   Domino's Pizza Inc. tried to cut down on
legal actions last year by giving its delivery people driving
instruction, but the safety effort also helped steer profits down
16.4 percent.
   The Ann Arbor-based company also said launching a new product,
pan pizza, led to a drop in 1989 profits to $5.1 million, compared
with net income of $6.1 million in 1988.
   Domino's has been the defendant in a series of legal actions
blaming traffic accidents on drivers rushing to meet the 30-minute
pizza delivery deadline. The company said costs come out of store
budgets and not drivers' pockets.
   A videotaped driver-training program was instituted in 1989.
   The privately held company's 5,200 stores, two-thirds of them
owned by about 800 franchisees, sold an estimated 250 million
pizzas in 1989, Domino's President Dave Black said.
   Systemwide sales rose 9.6 percent to $2.5 billion, compared with
$2.3 billion in 1988, and Domino's corporate revenue rose 9 percent
to $1.14 billion from $1.05 billion a year earlier, the company
said.
