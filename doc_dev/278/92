CITY CENTRE Restaurants, which owns, among others, the Garfunkels and Deep
Pan Pizza chains, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.32m to Pounds 4.76m
in the six months to June 30.
However, Mr Phillip Kaye, chief executive, described the group's growth in
the first half as 'slight'.
In particular, London, home of the 35 Garfunkels outlets, had been dreadful
until July 1, he said, when tourists seemed to arrive.
This was not helped by the fact that most of the Garfunkels restaurants had
been refurbished in the period under review, using most of the Pounds 3m of
capital expenditure.
The group had no borrowings and cash balances of Pounds 12m at the end of
June. This should rise to about Pounds 16m by the end of the year, said Mr
Kaye.
He ascribed the profits rise mostly to the just under 100-strong Deep Pan
Pizza chain.
As a volume business, he said that the promotions the chain had been running
for the past two years had been crucial. He added that margins under the
promotions - whereby you could eat as much as you liked from the pizza and
pasta buffets for Pounds 2.50, now risen to Pounds 3.25 - were 'not as tight
as you'd think. They are only tight when you don't have the volume'.
A further benefit of the promotions has been that 'they destroy the
competition'.
Some 40 Deep Pans are attached to cinemas, and Mr Kaye said that the film
Jurassic Park had done wonders for the trade in those outlets.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 42.1m) and operating profits to
Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 4.06m). The interim dividend is traditionallynot
increased at half-time and is again 0.45p, payable from earnings of 1.68p
(1.57p).
COMMENT
City Centre Restaurants, now valued at about Pounds 160m, has rather sneaked
up on the rails, and this sums up the style of the group. It has ridden out
the recession by quietly, carefully getting on with its business, which Mr
Kaye describes as 'one of the most straightforward and tidy ones you could
find. We just run restaurants'. The group resisted the temptations to which
many others in the leisure sector succumbed in the late-1980s, and
consequently has not fallen at any fences. Mr James Naylor, once of First
Leisure and latterly Whitegate Leisure, is set to take the reins from Mr
Kaye in October, and one hopes he will not feel it necessary to divert the
group from its track. Pencilled in pre-tax profits of about Pounds 12.5m for
the year give a multiple of just over 19, a deserved premium.
