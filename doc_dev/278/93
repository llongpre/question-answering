National Pizza Co. has filed suit in Sedgwick County District Court against 
Pizza Hut, which is trying to block National Pizza's attempt to acquire a chain 
of fast-seafood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
National Pizza, based in Pittsburg, Kan., is the largest U.S. franchiser of 
Pepsico Inc.'s Pizza Hut restaurants. Its sole business has been operating 
Pizza Hut franchises. 
</P>
<P>
The company last month made an unsolicited offer to buy Skipper's Inc. for 
$9.25 a share, or approximately $27 million. Skipper's, which operates 213 
restaurants in the western United States and British Columbia, has rejected the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pizza Hut officials advised National Pizza in a letter that the 
acquisition of Skipper's would violate its franchise agreement with Pizza Hut, 
said J. J. Fitzsimmons, chief financial officer for National Pizza, which 
operates more than 225 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"We responded asking for specifics on how it would violate the agreement, and 
they declined to provide details," Fitzsimmons said. Rather than wait for Pizza 
Hut to respond, National Pizza went to court on Tuesday in an effort to resolve 
the matter, Fitzsimmons said.
