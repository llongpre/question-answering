   Domino's Pizza owner Tom Monaghan
wants to help the 500 residents of this bucolic island make some
dough, and he's not just talking pizza.
   Monaghan, who owns a vacation home and corporate retreat on the
island, plans to create a bank to serve residents, a spokesman said.
The island has a credit union but no commercial bank, aide Dick
Brunvand said Wednesday.
   The entrepreneur will apply next month with the state and hopes
to open the bank by mid-1989, Brunvand said. Monaghan, who also owns
the Detroit Tigers baseball team, expects to be chairman of the bank.
   Monaghan owns 1,700 acres on the island off the eastern tip of
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The land is mainly used as a vacation
spot for Domino's employees and includes a golf course and compound
for three orphaned bear cubs.
   The pizza magnate is dredging the harbor to make room for his
sailing ship, the Domino Effect.
