   When Victor Posner decided to stand up a powerful group of his Arby's Inc. franchisees last month, Leonard H. Roberts, then president of the roast-beef-sandwich chain, urged the financier to reconsider. 

   "Just meet with them, or we'll have a crisis on our hands," Mr. Roberts recalls telling Mr. Posner. 
But the franchisees wanted the meeting so they could make an offer to buy the fast-food chain. 
Mr. Posner, chairman of the chain, would hear none of it on their terms, which included bringing a lawyer. 

   Now, as Mr. Roberts predicted, Arby's has a crisis on its hands. 
The canceled meeting and subsequent events have brought to a boil franchisee frustrations that had been simmering since Mr. Posner acquired the chain five years ago. 
In the past two weeks, Mr. Posner rejected a $200 million buy-out offer from a franchisee group, fired Mr. Roberts -- who had won the hearts of the franchise owners by engineering the chain's remarkable turnaround -- and installed a new president the franchisees find objectionable. 

   The uproar at Arby's is the latest example of the growing activism and rebelliousness of today's franchisees. 
"Franchisees are beginning to realize they have more economic power," says Don Boroian, chairman of Francorp Inc., a franchise consulting firm in Olympia Fields, Ill. 
Rupert Barkoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's Forum on Franchising, adds: "The leverage franchisees get in {buy-out} transactions is often the only way they have to protect their interests." 

   Sometimes, when franchisee concerns are ignored, the resulting rebellion can deliver a parent company into unwanted hands. 
Burger King's franchisees, already rankled by what they saw as Pillsbury Co.'s short-term outlook, banded together in loud opposition to Pillsbury's plan to spin off the struggling fast-food chain as a way to thwart a hostile takeover attempt by Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain. 
At the time, the spinoff plan seemed sure to doom Burger King by loading it with debt. 
Within weeks, the franchisees' opposition effectively derailed the plan. 
Pillsbury, lacking other substantial defenses, succumbed to Grand Met. 

   When franchisees aren't consulted on major management changes, the resulting rebellion can usher in new management. 
More than 100 Manpower Inc. franchisees, shocked at the sudden, forced resignation of longtime Chief Executive Mitchell Fromstein, met last December to try to bring him back. 
Partly because of their virulent reaction, the temporary-services company's new parent, Blue Arrow PLC of Britain, dumped its top executive and replaced him with Mr. Fromstein. 

   "You can't make radical changes that will affect {franchisees}, or may affect them, without bringing them into the loop," says Mr. Fromstein, who met with franchisees in 1975 asking their support before he took Manpower's top job. 

   But the Arby's case also shows how precarious a franchisee revolt can be. 
As today's franchisees become bigger and more sophisticated, franchisers increasingly make a point of giving them a stronger voice in system-wide decision-making. 
But when an owner, such as Mr. Posner, decides to take a hard line, both sides become engaged in a giant game of chicken. 

   "Posner is fighting with the people he really needs," says Leenie Ruben, president of Marketing Spectrum Inc., an Arby's marketing consultant. 
The franchisees, meanwhile, risk slowing Arby's growth and drawing retaliation from Mr. Posner if, say, they eventually decide to withhold royalties -- one option that has been considered. 
For now, the franchisees are mulling over their options and waiting. 

   Arby's franchisees have been wary of Mr. Posner since he acquired the chain in 1985 through a unit of his DWG Corp. 
His domineering style, his troubled businesses, his well-known distrust of most outsiders -- all spread fear throughout the Arby's system. 
Says Charles Hyslop, president of Sybra Inc., Arby's second-largest franchisee: "His reputation preceded him." 

   But Mr. Posner quickly scored points with big franchise owners by appointing Mr. Roberts, a former Ralston Purina Co. executive, to head Arby's, and, more importantly, by giving him operating autonomy. 
The move paid off. 
Under Mr. Roberts's direction, Arby's brought in hundreds of new franchisees and launched an aggressive ad campaign, challenging the bigger, better-known burger chains. 
Last year, sales for the chain's 2,100 resaurants rose 18% -- three times the industry's average gain -- to $1.16 billion. 

   But behind the scenes and the rosy numbers, Mr. Roberts says, he was continually fighting Mr. Posner's centralized system and strong-willed ways. 
Persistent battles over Mr. Posner's efforts to delay bonuses and incentives led Mr. Roberts to threaten to resign. 
Ira Hermann, a former Arby's executive who now is president of the Rax chain, says he is still waiting for his 1988 bonus. 

   Former executives say Mr. Posner also has tried to force a move of Arby's headquarters from Atlanta to Miami Beach, Fla., where Mr. Posner runs DWG and the rest of his far-flung empire. 
The franchisees and former executives say moving the company out of town would be costly and cause several key managers to leave. 

   A spokeswoman for Mr. Posner says plans to move Arby's were made with the "full cooperation of management." 
She says she doesn't know about the dispute over bonuses and couldn't comment. 
Mr. Posner couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Because Mr. Posner has a practice of holding on to cash as long as possible, according to people familiar with his operations, he required that checks over $500 be funneled into Miami Beach for signatures. 
That and other cash-flow maneuvers that slowed payment of bills prompted some suppliers to require some Arby's company-owned restaurants to pay cash for deliveries. 
Mr. Posner's spokeswoman plays down the significance of the check practice, adding that it didn't hurt Arby's. 

   But such maneuvering didn't escape the attention of Arby's franchisees, a close-knit fraternity. 
They became increasingly wary of Mr. Posner and began to develop contingency plans to counter moves they expected him to make. 
AFA Service Corp., the chain's franchisee-owned marketing arm, had plans for a rapid relocation out of Arby's headquarters to independent offices in Atlanta if Mr. Posner ever tried to move Arby's to Miami. 

   Concern over recent DWG litigation, though, is what finally pushed the franchisee group to launch a buy-out offer. 
For months, Mr. Posner's holding company has been fighting a $572 million hostile bid from New York investor Andrew Heine. 
DWG and Mr. Heine have now locked horns in litigation surrounding that takeover, the outcome of which, the franchisees worry, could eventually hurt Arby's -- for instance, if Mr. Posner has to pay a settlement. 

   The franchisee group, R.B. Partners Ltd., also made the offer because it worried that the Arby's senior executives who led the turnaround would be snapped up by other fast-food companies. 

   But the buy-out group, made up of eight large franchisees that own about a quarter of Arby's restaurants, met only Mr. Posner's firm rejection. 
Adding injury to insult for the franchisees, Mr. Posner last week replaced Mr. Roberts with Irving Riese, a principal at Riese Organization, a closely held New York company that controls more than 500 restaurants and realestate operations. 
Says Joseph Smalz, chairman of AFA Service, "How would you like someone who is your direct competitor to be your president?" 
Also, franchisees suspect that Mr. Riese is negotiating to buy Arby's from Mr. Posner, despite Mr. Posner's denials. 

   Despite all the commotion, it isn't clear how far, in the end, the franchisees will be able to push Mr. Posner. 
Even if they fail in their own buy-out attempt, the franchisees could end up exerting considerable influence over other possible transactions. 
Franchisee resistance, for example, could scare off a potential suitor or a lender. 
As Francorp's Mr. Boroian says: "A franchisee can be an animal whose hostility grows with every royalty check he writes."
