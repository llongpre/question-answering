   Princess Anne took a riding lesson during the
1989 World Cup show equestrian jumping championships, then
dismounted and sidestepped sensitive questions.
   The princess, whose marriage of 15 years to Mark Phillips is
said to be in trouble, maintained a low profile during her
three-day visit for the championship that ended Sunday.
   During a 15-minute session with reporters at the Florida State
Fairgrounds, the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II declined to comment
on Saturday's melee at a British soccer stadium that left at least
94 people dead.
   Reporters asked about the tragedy although they had been told to
limit their questions to horse-related matters.
   Earlier, she took a morning ride at the Bob Thomas Equestrian
Center under the direction of George Morris, a leading equestrian
trainer.
   A small crowd, consisting mostly of photographers and
plainclothes guards, watched the lesson, which Princess Anne said
was ``a very interesting experience and no doubt will do me a world
of good.''
   The princess presented the World Cup trophy to Ian Millar, who
successfully defended his title.

   Former actress Audrey Hepburn has given
emotional testimony on the hunger, starvation and death she
witnessed during a mercy mission to Sudan.
   Describing new arrivals at a refugee camp near the center of the
war-torn country, the goodwill ambassador of the United Nations
Children's Fund said Sunday:
   ``They have nothing left _ not even their bodies. They are so
emaciated. It seems that all they have left are their souls.''
   Ms. Hepburn spoke at a news conference in Nairobi, the first of
many she will conduct to publicize a massive U.N. Relief effort for
the southern Sudan.
   That effort has been plagued by delays caused by political
problems, weather and lack of equipment. U.N. officials have all
but conceded they will not meet their initial deadlines.
   They had hoped to move 105,000 tons of food, medicine and other
supplies into southern Sudan before the start of heavy rains in May
that close most roads and all but a few airstrips.
   With time running out before the storm season, directors of the
$172 million Operation Lifeline Sudan are considering air drops to
isolated and stranded villages.
   Ms. Hepburn, 59, visited three refugee camps in Sudan last week.

   Director Alan J. Pakula's latest film is about
the difficulties of a couple in their courtship leading to a second
marriage _ a subject he knows from personal experience.
   It is no accident that ``See You in the Morning'' is the first
film Pakula has written, directed and produced because the question
of personal control and vulnerability is key to the project.
   Pakula, director of such films as ``Klute,'' ``All the
President's Men,'' and ``Sophie's Choice,'' slipped into the second
person tellingly while discussing the film with The New York Times.
   ``Coming out of a bad experience, a relationship that failed,
there's a part of you that matures underneath that,'' Pakula said
in the interview published Sunday. ``But there's a part of you that
goes back to younger kinds of insecurities and vulnerabilities.
Rejection can do that to you.''
   In the film, which opens this week, Jeff Bridges and Alice Krige
play a couple whose previous marriages have failed. The film relies
on flashbacks to reveal how the two are haunted by the past as they
encounter one another.
   Pakula's first marriage, to the actress Hope Lange, ended 20
years ago. His current wife, biographer Hannah Cohn Boorstin, was a
widow when they met. They married in 1973.
   Pakula's troubles took place in California, while the film is
set in New York, and the couple portrayed are in their mid-30s,
younger than he was while he endured his own tough times, Pakula
said.
   ``I deliberately did not place them in a setting that would be
literally familiar to me,'' Pakula said.

   Tom Monaghan owns the Detroit Tigers
baseball club and one of the biggest pizza chains in the country,
but he always wanted a farm.
   So Monaghan, owner of Ann Arbor-based Domino's Pizza Inc.,
joined with a retired Alabama agriculture professor in a project
they hope will prove there's still money in small farms.
   Monaghan is financing the 25-acre spread three miles outside of
Ann Arbor. The soggy fields began their transformation last fall
under the supervision of Booker T. Whatley, author of the book
``How to Make $100,000 Farming 25 Acres,'' The Grand Rapids Press
reported Sunday.
   The goal is to show that farms of 10 to 200 acres can succeed as
well as family-run operations of 200 to 1,000 acres and
agribusiness concerns of 1,000 acres or more.
   ``This country can and should support all three categories,''
said Whatley, 73, formerly of the faculty of Tuskegee Institute and
publisher of the Small Farm Technical Newsletter.
   Monaghan read about Whatley in The Wall Street Journal. Seeing a
chance to fulfill his own dream, he introduced himself at a
speaking engagement by the agricultural theorist in Lansing.
   Since fall, workers have dug a trout pond, established a fallow
deer herd and begun building a 1-acre sinking garden for vegetable
production, farm manager Michael Trout said.
   Whatley's book argues that small farms can succeed if they
provide a year-round daily cash flow, produce at least 10 different
products with no one product making up more than 10 percent of the
gross, and produce goods that have definite markets.
   Monaghan said he will give his Domino's headquarters employees
the option of spending occasional days at the farm instead of
working their desk jobs.
