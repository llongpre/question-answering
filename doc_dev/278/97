<HEAD>National Pizza Files Suit Against Pizza Hut</HEAD>

   National Pizza Co. has filed suit in
Sedgwick County District Court against Pizza Hut, which is trying to
block National Pizza's attempt to acquire a chain of fast-seafood
restaurants.
   National Pizza, based in Pittsburg, Kan., is the largest U.S.
franchiser of Pepsico Inc.'s Pizza Hut restaurants. Its sole
business has been operating Pizza Hut franchises.
   The company last month made an unsolicited offer to buy Skipper's
Inc. for $9.25 a share, or approximately $27 million. Skipper's,
which operates 213 restaurants in the western United States and
British Columbia, has rejected the offer.
   On Monday, Pizza Hut officials advised National Pizza in a letter
that the acquisition of Skipper's would violate its franchise
agreement with Pizza Hut, said J.J. Fitzsimmons, chief financial
officer for National Pizza, which operates more than 225 restaurants.
   ``We responded asking for specifics on how it would violate the
agreement, and they declined to provide details,'' Fitzsimmons said.
   Rather than wait for Pizza Hut to respond, National Pizza went to
court on Tuesday in an effort to resolve the matter, Fitzsimmons
said.
   ``They want us to be a single-purpose franchisee. After the way
Pepsi has been growing ... they don't want us to grow,'' he said.
``We believe their interpretation of the franchise agreement is
discriminatory and unenforceable,'' he said.
   The lawsuit asks the court to rule whether the acquisition of
Skipper's would violate the franchise agreement between the two
pizza companies. A hearing to determine whether an injunction should
be issued is scheduled for Thursday.
   Roger Rydell, a spokesman at Pizza Hut's corporate headquarters
in Wichita, said a 1984 amendment signed by the two companies
``reconfirms the franchise agreement requirement that National Pizza
limit its business activities to operation of Pizza Hut system
restaurants.''
   ``We believe the proposed acquisition of Skipper's Inc. is in
direct violation of our agreements with National Pizza,'' he said.
   Gene Bicknell, chairman of the board of National Pizza Co., said
Pizza Hut is trying to manipulate National Pizza's future at the
expense of its shareholders.
   ``This investment in Skipper's by National Pizza Acquisition
Corp. will have absolutely no effect on the ability of National
Pizza Co. to continue to operate as the largest and most successful
Pizza Hut franchisee,'' Bicknell said.
   The lawsuit asks for a ruling before the Skipper's tender offer
expires on Feb. 28.
