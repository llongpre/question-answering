   A former Pizza Hut employee confessed
to burglaries at 58 of the chain's restaurants in three states in
the last year, authorities said.
   Larry Chamness, 22, of Granite City, was arrested last week on
suspicion of burglary in a break-in at a car wash. During
questioning, he confessed to a string of Pizza Hut burglaries in
southern Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky, police said.
   Chamness apparently chose Pizza Huts as his targets because he
``knew the system,'' said Detective Sgt. Richard Schardan of Granite
City police.
   Chamness was held Saturday in the Madison County Jail at
Edwardsville on $100,000 bond, in part for robberies at a chain
restaurant in Illinois. He was charged Friday in two burglaries at a
Pizza Hut in Missouri where he once worked.
   Police said Chamness told them he burglarized 58 Pizza Huts from
March 1988 to this month. He indicated he might have committed the
burglaries to get money to buy drugs, police said.
   In all, about $15,000 to $20,000 was taken from cash registers,
vending machines and safes in the restaurants, Schardan said.
