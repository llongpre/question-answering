   Sequoia celebrates its
centennial Tuesday as the second-oldest national park with its
superintendent hoping the home of the world's biggest trees will be
even better 100 years from now.
   A 13,255-foot mountain, one of thousands in the Sierra Nevada
range that forms California's spine, will be named Centennial peak
during a brief ceremony honoring both Sequoia and its slightly
younger cousin, Kings Canyon National Park.
   However, most of the celebration was on Sunday when people were
invited to visit the adjacent parks free and learn about their
history and future. Sequoia, 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles,
became a national park six days before Kings Canyon and their more
celebrated neighbor 80 miles north, Yosemite.
   President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation on Sept. 25,
1890, making Sequoia the second national park. Yellowstone was
established in 1872.
   At first, only 500 people a year visited the California parks
because they were so remote in the days before cars. Now, more than
1.6 million people a year visit Sequoia and Kings Canyon.
   That has caused park officials to start reducing human impact by
moving public facilities out of Sequoia's Giant Forest area, a
process that will take at least until the beginning of the 21st
century.
   ``We want to avoid designing facilities that lure people to one
spot and cause a crowd,'' Superintendent J. Thomas Ritter said as
he stood near the General Sherman tree, the largest living thing in
the world at 272 feet tall and containing 63,664 cubic feet of
lumber.
   The goal, he said, is to disperse people to points of interest
and programs spread throughout the park. ``If we are successful
today and the next 100 years, we will have overcome our biggest
potential problem,'' he said.
   Ritter noted that the task of dispersing people is easier over
the large area of Sequoia-Kings Canyon than at Yosemite, where
almost all the 3 million visitors a year want to visit narrow
Yosemite Valley.
   Visitors to Kings Canyon can travel to Grant Grove and look at
the General Grant Tree, officially the Nation's Christmas Tree, or
camp and hike along the John Muir Trail to high country lakes
formed by melting snow.
   Others can head south through the tall pines and firs of Sequoia
to the even taller and broader trees, many of them growing since
before Jesus was born.
   People can take a healthy hike a few hundred feet up to Moro
Rock and look over the western divide or a much longer, harder hike
up Mount Whitney, at 14,495 feet above sea level the tallest
mountain in the contiguous 48 states.
   ``The people clearly have to come on the natural terms of the
park,'' Ritter said. ``But the geography is in our favor.''
