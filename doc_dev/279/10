<LEADPARA>  IT'S HARD to reconcile the idea of planning a camping trip to a national park
with calling an 800 phone number to reach a Ticketron office.;    But that is
how camping reservations for the 14 busiest parks in the federal system are
being made.;    The toll-free number was instituted in February, replacing
last year's 900 super-toll number.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new number is (800) 452-1111, usable in all 50 states, seven days a
week from 8 a.m. to midnight, central time.;    From outside the United
States, a toll call must be made to Chicago: (312) 902-1919. Before 1990,
those wanting to reserve campsites had to apply in writing. Written
applications are still acceptable at those 14 parks on the new 800 number;
applications may be sent to Ticketron, Box 617516, Chicago, Ill. 60661-7516.; 
  Duncan Morrow, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said they were
reluctant to adopt any reservations system, but discovered that first-come
first-served meant that in busy parks visitors not in line by 6 a.m. did not
get a site.;    These are the camping areas where credit-card holders may
reserve by phone:;    Grand Canyon in Arizona, 310 sites on the South Rim and
83 sites on the North Rim; Yellowstone in Arizona, 420 sites at Bridge Bay;
Death Valley, 253 sites in Furnace Creek and Texas Spring; Joshua Tree, 100
sites at Black Rock Canyon; Sequoia-Kings Canyon, 250 sites at Lodgepole;
Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity, 150 sites at Oak Bottom; Yosemite, 1,172 sites at
eight areas; Rocky Mountain in Colorado, 393 sites in Moraine Park and Glacier
Basin; Acadia in Maine, 306 sites at Blackwoods; Assateague Island off
Maryland and Virginia, 152 sites at Oceanside and Bayside; Ozark National
Scenic Riverways in Missouri, 195 sites at Big Spring; Cape Hatteras National
Seashore in North Carolina, 136 sites at Ocracoke; Great Smoky Mountains in
Tennessee and North Carolina, 517 sites at Smokemont, Elkmont and Cade's Cave;
and Shenandoah in Virginia, 217 sites at Big Meadows.;    In addition to the
camping fees, which range from $8 to $16 a night, people booking through the
800 number must pay a $4 handling fee.;    According to Tom Largi, the
National Parks expert at Ticketron, the average toll paid last year on the 900
number was $2.75, and the Park Service, which has a contract with Ticketron
for the reservations work, had no objection to a standard $4 fee.;    Camping
reservations for families and individuals may not be made more than eight
weeks in advance; group reservations may be made 12 weeks ahead.;    When
calling for a reservation, be ready to give your name, address, telephone
number, the number of people and types of pets in your party, the equipment --
tent, trailer, recreational vehicle -- and its size, and the campground you
want.;    Visa and Mastercard only are accepted for charges; people without
these cards may request an application form and mail it in with a check.;   
Largi said that if the reservation is made well in advance, a printed
confirmation is mailed along with a flier summarizing information on all 14
Ticketron-reservable parks. If there is not enough time, the reservation will
be held at the park entrance.;    First-time National Park campers can browse
through options with the help of a somewhat outdated paperback Government
publication, "The National Parks: Camping Guide 1988-89.";    It includes a
map locating places under Park Service direction that have camping areas,
describes parks and sites, with charts on available amenities, and health and
safety warnings. It is $6.95 from Consumer Information Center, Department
151W, Pueblo, Colo. 81009.;    Michael Frome's large format "National Park
Guide" for 1991 is available. Published by Prentice Hall, it covers all the
parks, not just those with camping areas. More narrative and personal, it does
not provide details on campsites. It costs $15 in paperback.;    During the
Gulf war, prognosticators were betting that 1991 would see a big rise in use
of national parks. Indeed, according to Largi, reservations at year-round
parks in the first two months of the year were up 143 percent over the first
two months of 1990.;    But this may not all be because of the war. At
Yosemite, for example, which is busy all year, 1991 reservations were 79
percent over the first two months of 1990: 3,637, up from 2,024. Largi
attributed this to two causes: a mild winter at the park, and a fire last fall
that kept campers out.;    The 233 camping sites at the South Rim of the Grand
Canyon sell out for Easter every year, no matter how early Easter is,
according to Morrow.;    The Park Service keeps precise annual records of
visitors to the 355 areas under its supervision -- parks, monuments, historic
sites, seashores.;    Ken E. Hornback of the service's Socioeconomic Studies
section in Denver said that attendance at some was at saturation now, citing
Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Golden Gate National Recreation Area near San
Francisco.;    Some park statistics show contradictory trends. Back-country
camping permits, for people who stay overnight with what they can carry in on
their backs, have remained steady: 1,621,776 in 1989 and 1,650,346 in 1990.;  
 Permits for camping in recreational vehicles peaked in 1987 at 4.1 million
overnight stays, Hornback said, and are still on the decline: 3,884,740 in
1989 and 3,794,044 in 1990.;    Tent camping was at 3.5 million in 1985,
"popped up" to 4 million in 1987 and has pretty much stayed there. Concession
lodging, meaning inns and cabins operated by park concessioners, has risen
from the 3.5 million recorded in 1985 to nearly 4 million in 1990.  </TEXT>
