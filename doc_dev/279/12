   Forest fires this week in California's Yosemite National Park
have cooked up memories of 1988, when flames swept across another
cherished piece of the West: Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
   The fires have a lot in common. Both were aggravated by extreme
drought and a decades-long buildup of dry, downed wood. And fires
in both parks are considered natural _ even essential _ ecological
forces.
   But Yosemite officials are glad of one big difference: They have
so far escaped the harsh criticism that Yellowstone's fires focused
on the National Park Service's policy of letting some forest fires
burn.
   During the virtually rainless summer of 1988, fires swept
through nearly half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres. The unusual
drought surprised Yellowstone managers, who clung for weeks to
their standing policy of letting most natural fires burn if no
human lives or property are threatened.
   By mid-July, when officials declared war on all fires within the
park, it was too late. Only the cooler, wetter weather of autumn
stopped the flames.
   The controversy raged even longer, as the Park Service took heat
for what critics called a ``let-it-burn'' policy.
   This past week in Yosemite, fire has charred more than 18,000
acres and caused more than $10 million in property damage. While
small compared to the Yellowstone fires, the fires have been
especially destructive in the popular park, where almost every
feature of the landscape is treasured by visitors.
   Fire destroyed 66 homes in Foresta, a vacation village near the
park. Four other communities were evacuated, and the 759,000-acre
park has been closed to visitors since Friday.
   But criticism of the Park Service has been light.
   Like Yellowstone, Yosemite has a policy of letting
lightning-struck fires burn in some areas. But the fires this
summer are burning in ``suppression areas,'' where fires are fought
automatically because of their proximity to roads or buildings,
said Sue Fritzke, a Yosemite fire official.
   ``There was no question of policy at all,'' she said.
   It also helps that Californians are more accustomed to drought
and wildfire, she said. While Yellowstone's fires were a
hundred-year event, the Yosemite fires are the result of a
four-year statewide drought, and are by no means California's worst
blazes this summer.
   ``California was made to burn,'' Fritzke said. ``People here
understand that fire is a part of the ecosystem.''
   In both parks, officials blamed the intensity of the fires on
100 years of unenlightened management. ``You always thought fires
were bad and you put them out. That was in the days before we
understood the role fire plays in forest ecology,'' said Joan
Anzelmo, a Yellowstone spokeswoman.
   By not allowing periodic, small fires to sweep the forest clear
of fallen dead wood and underbrush, managers set the stage for
huge, destructive fires. That practice changed in the early 1970s,
but there's still a buildup of downed wood and underbrush left over
from earlier days.
   Huge sequoias in Yosemite, for example, have survived 2,000
years of periodic fire and drought. But they are susceptible to
intense crown fires that roar through the canopy of the overgrown
forest, so crews this week sprayed the majestic sequoias with flame
retardant chemicals.
   Normal fire policy is on hold in both parks. In Yosemite,
managers are waiting for more manpower and cooler weather before
resuming theri controlled burns. In Yellowstone, all blazes have
been fought since 1988, pending adoption of a new, stricter fire
management plan due out next year.
   Officials in both parks said fire demonstrates nature's amazing
recuperative ability. After the 1988 fires, Yellowstone researchers
watched in wonder as plants poked up through ash and wildlife
wandered back to begin a new cycle of life.
   In Yosemite this week, the persistence of human nature was also
apparent.
   Doug Martin, a Foresta resident whose home burned down, is
calling neighbors this week to tell them of damage to their homes.
Most of them don't care so much about how the town looks or if it's
safe to return. Martin said their first question is: ``Are we going
to be allowed to rebuild?''
