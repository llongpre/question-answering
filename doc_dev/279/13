Dave Brower is America's most charismatic conservationist. Some say -- I among 
them -- that he has accomplished more through the force of one man's will than 
any of his breed since John Muir. At age 77, he leads the pack for the title of 
America's most arrogant, opinionated, pig-headed and autocratic conservationist 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Brower is never dull. This man John McPhee so aptly dubbed nature's "Archdruid" 
has been trying, by his own admission, to produce an autobiography for years. 
"For Earth's Sake" is half the loaf, revved up to make the Earth Day 
publication tie-in; Part II is scheduled for fall. 
</P>
<P>
What Brower offers is mostly recycled essays from his years of editorializing 
for the Sierra Club Bulletin and Friends of the Earth's Not Man Apart, spliced 
with contemporary annotation and transition. Another environmental curmudgeon, 
Edward Abbey, used the same recycling trick time after time and got away with 
it for the same reason that Brower will in "For Earth's Sake": It's damned good 
material. Pieces dating back more than 40 years will now find a larger audience 
than Sierra Club historians. 
</P>
<P>
Brower grew up in Berkeley, where his father taught at the university. The 
unspoiled hills and streams behind campus were his introduction to nature, and 
some of Berkeley's larger boulders his initiation into climbing. For all I 
know, Brower's ascents of Founder's Rock may have marked the founding of that 
city's renown for its mountaineers and rock climbers. He was an avid butterfly 
collector, and made his acquaintance with scientific terminology, population 
biology, and ecology in that way. By age 6, he was car-camping with his family 
in the Sierra Nevada. Brower also loved fast cars: His claimed record of 3 
hours 25 minutes from Yosemite to Berkeley in a 1934 Plymouth nearly matches my 
own reckless time on modern wheels and freeways! 
</P>
<P>
Brower failed in one area about which he is still sensitive: He dropped out of 
UC Berkeley as a youth and never did graduate from college. That failure may 
have catalyzed Brower's view of himself -- despite his fame -- as outsider, and 
initiated his chronic distrust of experts, especially governmental ones. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Sierra Club that focused Brower's unformed conservation and provided 
his first and most important platform. He returned the favor by molding a local 
nature and outdoor club into a sophisticated and powerful nationwide force for 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Dams loom large in Brower's legend, and they were the anvil on which Brower 
hammered the club into a modern social force. Preceding Brower, the damming of 
Yosemite's Hetch-Hetchy Valley had ripped the nascent Sierra Club apart. When 
the wounds had healed, the legend of Hetch-Hetchy gave the club the courage to 
oppose damming the Kings River, and gave us Kings Canyon National Park instead. 
</P>
<P>
Imminent drowning of Dinosaur National Monument by the proposed Echo Park dam 
and reservoir in 1954 fully brought out Brower's immense talent at writing, 
speech making and playing politics. For the first time, he ruthlessly dragged 
agencies such as the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corp of Engineers into 
the public arena and damned them. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, in a bid to appear more conciliatory and in dire fear of 
losing the Grand Canyon itself, the club and Brower traded away Glen Canyon 
Dam. It was a terrible mistake, says Brower: "I asked Dave Brower why he just 
sat, and have continued to ask him. He has no answer. . . . It was not that he 
had not heard, from those who knew, how beautiful Glen Canyon was. It was not 
that he thought Glen Canyon Dam was necessary, because he knew it was not. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Those were heady years. By way of expiation, the Sierra Club published an 
exhibit format book about Glen Canyon: "The Place No One Knew." Brower: " . . . 
the moral is simple: Progress need not deny to the people their inalienable 
right to be informed and to choose. In Glen Canyon the people never knew what 
the choices were. Next time, in other stretches of the Colorado, on other 
rivers that are still free, and wherever there is wildness that can be part of 
our civilization instead of victim to it, the people need to know before a 
bureau's elite decide to wipe out what no one can replace." Not blind 
opposition to progress, but opposition to blind progress. 
</P>
<P>
When flooding Grand Canyon became an issue again, Brower was ready with another 
book, "Time and the River Flowing: Grand Canyon." Full-page ads in major 
newspapers were the next weapon Brower tried. The ads brought waves of new 
members to the Sierra Club, people who joined for conservation rather than 
hiking company, and they cost the club its tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
By no means all who experienced the transition were grateful. In 1969, 
revolution completed, the Sierra Club fired Brower as executive director and 
premier -- an episode which Brower headlines "How the Sierra Club Misuses Power 
and Talent, or How to Avoid the Four-Letter B-Word (BOLD)." The club is so 
eager to appear reasonable that it goes soft, undercuts the strong grass-roots 
efforts of chapters, groups and other organizations -- as if the new 
professionalization and prioritization require rampant tenderization. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Brower created Friends of the Earth in his own radical image. 
Scarcely a decade later, a mature and successful organization, FOE would 
likewise toss out Brower. FOE could no longer function as his fief. Today, 
Brower's mouthpiece is Earth Island Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In his eighth decade, Brower is utterly unbowed. A few years back he was among 
the first to back Interior Secretary Hodel's proposal to drain Hetch-Hetchy. 
The conservation groups were late and weak in supporting it, not trusting Hodel 
and his motives. "The city's total revenue from power from its Hetch-Hetchy 
project's origin until now has far exceeded the cost of the facilities to 
produce it," he writes, "and that excess has in effect been a free ride for San 
Francisco at a substantial cost to the people who have been denied the 
intangible benefits of Hetch- Hetchy Valley for all these years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about just 'a campground,' as Mayor Feinstein is reported 
to have described Hetch-Hetchy. We are talking about an integral part of a 
national park that belongs not to San Francisco, not to California, not to the 
United States but to the world as part of the World Heritage. San Francisco 
owes us this one. It took Hetch- Hetchy under false pretenses in the first 
place. The city claimed that no other site would do, and that was false. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Brower's whimsy and casual approach to facts, his assumption that agency 
employees are Philistine can be maddening. At times, Brower is simply 
inexplicable. For some perverse reason of his own, he credits improvements in 
Yosemite Valley to the Curry Co., fabled in profit margin, rather than to his 
much benighted National Park Service, which has fought Curry to reduce the 
traffic and its impact. 
</P>
<P>
Brower once lived in Yosemite Valley for three years, working for Yosemite Park 
and Curry Co. He was fired by the company, yet is "impressed by its managers' 
concern for the valley. Even more so now, as I marvel at the genius with which 
the impact of 6 million human feet is kept to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what we would have done without him.
