<LEADPARA>  Private businesses operating at national parks and other U.S.-owned recreation
spots are so loosely controlled that fraud and abuse are possible, a
congressional investigator said today.;    Keith Fultz, of the General
Accounting Office, told a House panel that the concessioners are not closely
watched by agencies such as the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest
Service.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Fultz, repeating figures obtained Wednesday by the Associated Press, said
the concessioners -- under legal agreements with U.S. agencies -- return less
than 3 percent of their gross revenues to the government.;    The investigator
told the House Government Operations environment subcommittee that there is
poor central record-keeping on the contracts and on the performance of the
private businesses.;    Fraud, abuse questions;  "They (the agencies) really
aren't managing the concession agreements," Fultz said, adding that with such
poor "internal controls . . . questions always are raised about fraud and
abuse. This is a very loosely controlled program.";    The agencies will have
a chance to renegotiate hundreds of contracts over the next few years, federal
documents show.;    More than 100 concession contracts negotiated by the
National Park Service alone are expiring by 1994, giving the agency the chance
to demand higher returns.;    Fultz said the concessioners' gross earnings
topped $1.5 billion in 1989. "I would find it difficult to conclude the
government is getting its fair return," he said in an interview Wednesday.;   
Rep. Mike Synar, chairman of the subcommittee, is pushing the agencies to
increase the concessioner payments in future negotiations.;    'Taxpayers
ripped off';  "We want a fair return for these concessions," the Oklahoma
Democrat said Wednesday. "Taxpayers are being ripped off. These are taxpayer
assets.";    But Allan Howe, Washington representative of the 150-company
Conference of National Park Concessioners, said Synar's plan to charge the
private operators 22.5 percent of revenues "would put a lot of concessioners
completely out of business.";    GAO data obtained Wednesday by the Associated
Press said low concessioner payments -- $32.2 million of the more than $1.5
billion earned last year -- was compounding budget woes in national parks and
forests.;    The National Park Service deferred $1.9 billion of maintenance in
1988, the GAO said. The U.S. Forest Service has deferred $650 million worth of
maintenance and reconstruction as of October 1989, the investigative arm of
Congress reported.;    Some contracts expiring;  The fees paid by the
concessioners were legally negotiated between the private operators and
federal agencies. Contracts expiring during the next four years include
agreements for some of the best-known national parks and seashores: Rocky
Mountain, Bryce Canyon, Cape Cod, Cape Hatteras, Death Valley, the Grand
Canyon, Grand Teton and Sequoia-Kings Canyon.;    Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan has ordered a review of the way the agency sets concessioner fees. The
department's inspector general a year ago issued a stinging report criticizing
the low return to the government.;     Fees vs. receipts;  Some fees paid by
concessionaires at individual sites:; (box)Yosemite Park and Curry Co. had
gross receipts of $76.5 million and paid a franchise fee of $590,195.;
(box)AMFAC Hotels and Resorts at the Grand Canyon took in $48.7 million in
gross receipts, paying $1.2 million in fees.; (box)The Circle Line-Statue of
Liberty Ferry in New York City had $9.2 million in gross receipts, paying a
fee of $925,222.; (box)The capital's Tourmobile Inc. had gross receipts of
$6.3 million and paid fees of $255,720.; Source: 1988 Park Service figures  </TEXT>
