<LEADPARA>  Yosemite National Park is developing a drought contingency plan to deal with
possible water shortages this summer.;    While no parkwide closing is
anticipated, services probably will be reduced in areas dependent upon surface
water. Areas of major concern center on Wawona, Tuolumne Meadows, White Wolf
and Tioga Pass, among the favorite visitor areas away from Yosemite Valley.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Yosemite Valley, the prime visitor attraction, should not face major
water-related problems because it is supplied from deep wells.;    Len
McKenzie, a park official heading a drought task force, said one of the
options under consideration is "dry camping," in which portable or chemical
toilets would be used in place of regular flush toilets in campgrounds.;   
Other options include developing new water sources, trucking in water and
phased cutbacks.;    "It's likely that we will close some facilities as the
summer goes on, but we do not anticipate a total park closure," McKenzie
said.;    "Our goal is to conserve the water sources we have and provide the
highest possible level of visitor services and still protect the park
resources," he said.;    The drought plan is patterned after one announced two
weeks ago at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks. It calls for campgrounds and
other park areas to be closed in phased stages as water supplies become
marginal.  </TEXT>
