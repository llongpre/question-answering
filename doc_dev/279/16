<TEXT>     The museum will contain a bus like the one on which Rosa Parks touched off
the civil rights movement in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955, when she refused to
move to the back.;    Also on display will be a reproduction of a lunch
counter representing those that were the scene of the sit-ins that took place
in subsequent years. The museum will offer several audiovisual programs and
sound-and-light displays.;    The Lorraine Motel, on Mulberry Street, is near
Beal Street and the downtown district of Memphis. The museum will be open
Tuesday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and, Sunday from 1 to 6 p.m.
(closed 5 p.m. September to May). Admission is $5; $4 for seniors and students
and $3 for children aged 6 to 12. Information: (901) 521-9699.; Beverly Hills;
 (box) The Peninsula Beverly Hills, the first hotel to be built in the city
limits of Beverly Hills for more than 20 years, is scheduled to open Aug. 8.
The hotel, at Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevards, is about 20 minutes from
Los Angeles International Airport and within walking distance of Rodeo Drive.
It has 200 rooms, including 32 suites in the main building and 16 suites in
two-story villas set in gardens. Every room will have a safe and two
telephones (one in the bathroom) with two lines and speaker, plus hookups for
fax and computer modem. All suites will have fax machines and compact disk
players.;    Daily room rates will be $265 to $295, and suites, $340 to
$2,500. Information: Peninsula Beverly Hills, 9882 Santa Monica Boulevard,
Beverly Hills 90212; (800) 462-7899.; Yosemite;  (box) Yosemite National Park
has been added to a National Park Service recycling effort that collected 86
tons of recycled material last year in the Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains
and Acadia National Parks.;    The effort at Yosemite includes "bear-proof"
recycling bins designed to take plastic, glass and aluminum. The recycling
message is being incorporated into the park service's 75th anniversary
observances. Other parks in the Pacific Northwest, Florida and Washington,
D.C., are being considered for the recycling program. More than 250 million
people visited national parks last year.; Hawaii rental taxes;  (box) Renting
a car in Hawaii may get more expensive. The state legislature has passed a
bill that, if signed into law, would add a $2 surcharge for each day that a
car was rented. Car-rental bargains abound in the tourist state, and with
$89-a-week deals not uncommon, the surcharge could amount to a 10 to 15
percent increase.;    In addition, the legislation increases the state tax on
gasoline to 16 cents, from 11 cents per gallon. It also increases annual
rental vehicle registration fees and sets a tour bus surcharge, both of which
are likely to be passed on to consumers.;    The fuel tax hikes take effect
July 1, registration hikes Oct. 1 and surcharges Jan. 1.  </TEXT>
