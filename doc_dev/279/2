Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, which abut each other in the Sierra, 
are the first in the nation to resume a policy of letting some lightning fires 
burn themselves out, officials reported. A National Park Service policy of 
letting selected fires burn naturally was suspended last year after a decision 
to let wildfires go uncontrolled in Yellowstone National Park was criticized. 
The suspension has been lifted only at Sequoia and Kings Canyon after approval 
by regional director Lew Albert of the park service of a revised fire 
management plan for the two parks, spokesman William Tweed said. Fires will be 
allowed to burn only within specific ranges of temperature, wind speed and fuel 
moisture, Tweed said. Enough firefighters must be on hand to put out a fire if 
necessary. "The goal of the program is to perpetuate the role of natural fire 
in park ecosystems without threatening public safety or property," Tweed said.
