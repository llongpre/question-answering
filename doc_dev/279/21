   California firefighters face a long, hot weekend with multiple
wildfires that charred more than 150,000 acres of timber and closed
Yosemite National Park, while other Western states battled
persistent blazes of their own.
   Idaho, Washington and Oregon were other targets of electrical
storms that brought a week of fire-sparking lightning bolts to the
Pacific Northwest.
   Fifteen major fires raged in California today, combined with
hundreds of smaller blazes. Seventy-two buildings were burned
several areas were evacuated.
   A National Guard helicopter crashed Friday while lifting water
from a pond. One crew member suffered minor injuries and two others
aboard escaped without injury, officials said.
   The helicopter crew was working to douse the Pine Creek fire,
which has charred 70,000 acres of forest. It was among the largest
of the blazes plaguing drought-stricken California, where more than
21,000 lightning strikes hit last week.
   More thunderstorms were predicted this weekend, along with hot
temperatures and high winds, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Gary Lipari.
   Fires near Yosemite closed the park and burned 12,000 acres of
forest, charring 66 structures and 14 vehicles. Rangers sent 10,000
park visitors packing.
   Other large blazes roared at the Lassen County town of Ravendale
and in Tehama County and Sequoia National Park.
   Firefighters were spread so thin that only an 18-person crew was
fighting a 2,500-acre wildfire in the King Mountain Range, a
federal wilderness area on the north coast that includes habitat of
the endangered spotted owl.
   Wind-driven flames racing through dry brush and trees made
firefighting dangerous. Two crews were overrun, one in Yosemite and
another in Sequoia National Forest, but the firefighters escaped
serious injury by scrambling into heat-resistant tents.
   A reinforced army of 8,000 federal and state firefighters isn't
enough, officials said. The U.S. Forest Service late Friday asked
the military for 1,000 servicemen to join firefighting forces.
   In Washington and Oregon, firefighters mopped up older,
dwindling fires as new, lightning sparked blazed cropped up. Most
were small, measuring less than an acre late Friday.
   In Idaho, crews got a reprieve from five days of triple-digit
temperatures as they battled three huge range fires in the southern
part of the state, including the 66,000-acre Thorn Creek blaze.
   Humid air Friday and cooler temperatures helped turn a raging
monster into a slow-moving snake that blackened sagebrush and grass
along an 18-mile swath.
   Farther south, a 12,000-acre blaze burned toward a fire line,
pushed by winds gusting to 50 mph, said Sawtooth National Forest
spokesman El Waldapfel.
   To the north, hundreds of firefighters were scattered through
national forests where more than 60 fires burned after three
straight days of lightning. ``Our problems are like everybody
else's _ limited resources,'' said Salmon National Forest spokesman
Tom Patten.
