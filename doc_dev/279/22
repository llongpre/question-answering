   The number of pine trees
in Yosemite Park damaged by ozone has increased more than five-fold
in the last five years, according to a new study.
   The report, released this week, says 29.7 percent of Yosemite's
pines now show mottling caused by damage from ozone, a colorless,
odorless gas produced by auto and industrial emissions. A similar
study in 1985 found 5.7 percent of the trees had suffered damage,
the National Park Service reported.
   Officials at Yosemite, which celebrated its 100th birthday as a
national park Oct. 1, said they need to study the 1990 findings
before they can comment on ways to alleviate the problem. But a
decade-old master plan for the park in the central Sierra Nevada
calls for eventually abolishing vehicle traffic by tourists into
Yosemite Valley, their prime destination.
   No timetable has been announced for the plan to force tourists
to switch to trams or buses and leave their cars above Yosemite
Valley.
   But National Park Service Director James Ridenour has promised
that park maintenance facilities will be moved out of the valley,
perhaps starting as early as the 1992 fiscal year.
   The effects of ozone in the Sierra Nevada first were noticed in
the 1970s at Sequoia National Park, 100 miles south of Yosemite and
less than 150 miles north of Los Angeles. The Park Service has
commissioned research to determine if ozone affects giant sequoias
as it does pine trees.
   Diane Ewell, Sequoia's air quality specialist, says officials
may start a system to warn visitors when the park's ozone is high,
much like the alerts in smogbound cities such as Los Angeles.
