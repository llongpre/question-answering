<TEXT>  (box) DISTANCE: 13 miles round trip.; (box) DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate,
but don't try to do it in wet weather.; (box) DETAILS: Go 0.2 miles from the
Lone Oak picnic area to Raccoon group camp, which is the start of the Loop
Trail. Follow Loop Trail to Wildcat Creek Trail and into Wildcat Regional
Park. At the intersection with Belgium Trail, bear right and climb sharply for
nearly a mile to the junction of Clark Boas and San Pablo Ridge trails. Ignore
the unmarked road to the right and continue past the Clark Boas Trail several
hundred yards to the San Pablo Ridge Trail cutoff to the right. The ridge
trail follows the ridge line for the next 1.3 miles and then goes downhill to
Nimitz Way. You can either stay on the paved Nimitz Way to Inspiration Point
and Meadow Canyon Trail back to your car, or you can exit on the less-used
Conlon Trail and descend to Wildcat Creek Trail, where you turn left and
retrace your steps to the parking lot.; Source: "Mountain Biking in the Bay
