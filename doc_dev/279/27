   Tom King plans to marry Vivian Taylor
this Saturday. Right after the ceremony, he'll jump off a bridge.
   King is one of 300 parachuting daredevils who plan to leap off
North America's second-highest bridge 876 feet into the New River
Gorge, a canyon slicing through the heart of the Appalachians.
   The wedding, on the New River Gorge Bridge, falls on the 11th
annual Bridge Day. That's the one day a year the span is closed to
traffic so pedestrians can enjoy the view and the autumn foliage -
and parachutists can jump off.
   The event attracts the largest number of parachutists who belong
to the U.S. BASE Association. BASE stands for building, antenna,
span and earth.
   ``For most of the jumpers, this is it,'' said Jean Boenish,
BASE's executive director. ``They take their vacation time, save
their pennies and wait to get out to West Virginia.''
   The U.S. 19 bridge, completed in 1977, is the longest steel arch
bridge in the world and the second highest in North America, after
the 1,053-foot Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado.
   About 100,000 spectators are expected, said Cindy Whitlock of
the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce. Hotels have been booked for
months in Fayette County and are selling out fast in Raleigh and
Kanawha counties, Whitlock said.
   King, 39, a real estate agent in Memphis, Tenn., brought Taylor
to Bridge Day last year and ``she literally loved the place.''
   ``I fell in love with her. She fell in love with me. She fell in
love with the bridge,'' he said.
   ``It seemed logical at the time'' to plan a wedding there, King
said.
   Taylor, 34, a registered nurse, said the wedding will be as
traditional as it can be on a bridge. She will wear a gown, the
groom will wear a tuxedo, and there will be five bridesmaids and
groomsmen.
   After the ceremony, King, two groomsmen and a few guests will
leap off the bridge. Taylor said that for her, just watching is
enough. She called last year's experience ``a natural high you just
can't explain.''
   But King, a veteran skydiver, said there's nothing to worry
about, even though three people have been killed in leaps from the
bridge, two during Bridge Day festivities. The last death was in
1987.
   ``It's fun. It's a sport. It's challenging,'' King said. ``We
don't think it's dangerous. Nothing's dangerous if you know what
you're doing.''
   Boenish said most BASE jumpers are trained skydivers. She
described the experience:
   ``As soon as you jump off, you're kind of suspended, and then
you start falling, and you get through that and what you start to
get into is that familiar comfort of high air speed.''
   King describes the bridge jump as ``high anxiety followed by
total euphoria.''
   ``The jump itself is extremely nerve-racking, but as soon as the
parachute opens and everything's OK, it's beautiful,'' he said.
   The jumpers leap from the bridge's center and fall at speeds
nearing 60 mph before slowing down to land on a sandbar, Boenish
said.
   Parachutists were prohibited from taking the plunge last year
because the river, which is also popular with white-water rafters,
was running dangerously high following heavy rain. But about three
dozen jumpers went off the bridge anyway and a few were arrested.
   The river under the bridge is under federal jurisdiction as the
New River Gorge National River. While BASE jumping is banned from
federal properties like Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, no one
will be banned from jumping into the gorge this year if conditions
are favorable, National Park Service Chief Ranger Bill Blake said.
   But parachutists who jump when it's not legal face up to six
months in prison, a$$5,000 fine, and would be banned for life from
jumping off the New River bridge, Blake said.
   Boenish expects 300 jumpers from six countries, including
Australia and South Africa.
