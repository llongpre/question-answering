   The federal government should move all hotels
and other concessions out of the national parks, an environmental
group said Tuesday in releasing a report on what it considers the
10 most threatened parks.
   George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society, also urged
the government to end subsidies for activities of other federal
agencies that could hurt the parks.
   ``Motels and hotels and that kind of thing should go outside the
national parks,'' Frampton said at a news conference. ``Jails and
concession stands don't belong in a sound master plan.''
   In its section on Yosemite National Park in California, the
report noted that plans call for a beauty parlor and a jail.
   Frampton's remarks were the latest in more than 60 years of
controversy over what the national parks should contain. There have
been hotels in the parks since the earliest days of the National
Park Service, which was founded in 1916 _ and calls for their
removal almost as long.
   Denis Galvin, deputy director of the service, said the agency
did not want to add any hotels in parks. But he said it believed
``the level of development in the traditional parks is appropriate
and provides an opportunity for a park experience that's rapidly
becoming unique. ... and just as valid as the backpacking
experience. We aim to provide both.''
   The society's report was timed to coincide with the beginning of
the summer vacation season that could bring record visitor loads to
many parks, and to precede the first meeting in 12 years of all
park superintendents, scheduled for next month at a lodge near
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
   The Wilderness Society and other advocacy groups have stepped up
campaigns in recent years for protective measures to be taken
outside park boundaries. ``These lands should have been in the
parks in the first place,'' Frampton said.
   ``We are losing $200 million to $300 million every year selling
our trees,'' frequently from Forest Service lands near national
parks, Frampton said. Much of this logging destroys habitat for
wildlife that roams freely across park boundaries, opponents say.
   ``The transfer of $100 million from this activity would make an
enormous difference without costing the taxpayer a cent,'' Frampton
said.
   More than $100 million is needed, Frampton said. He noted that
the Wilderness Society is part of a lobbying coalition that seeks
enactment of a trust fund for federal, state and local park and
recreation land that would eventually yield $1 billion a year.
   Galvin said the service believes logging is acceptable with
proper safeguards such as preservation of critical wildlife habitat.
   Here is the society's list of the 10 most threatened
installations, listed alphabetically because no ranking was given,
and the major threats in the group's view. All are national parks
except the Manassas battlefield, a national battlefield park, and
the Santa Monica Mountains, a national recreation area.
   _Everglades, Fla.: changes in water quality and quantity because
of agricultural and uran development, also planned low-altitude
fights by the Air Force.
   _Glacier, Mont.: oil drilling, logging and construction nearby.
   _Grand Canyon, Ariz.: noise from sightseeing flights, expected
to be reduced by forthcoming regulations, as well as mining nearby
and operation of the Glen Canyon Dam upstream for peaking power,
disturbing flow in the Colorado River.
   _Great Smoky Mountains, Tenn. and N.C.: logging nearby, air
pollution and destruction by wild boars brought to the area in the
1920s.
   _Manassas, Va., a shopping center planned on 542 acres adjacent
to the Civil War battlefield.
   _Olympic, Wash.: nearby logging and destruction by non-native
wild goats.
   _Rocky Mountain, Colo.: overcrowding and nearby logging and
condominium construction.
   _Santa Monica Mountains, Calif.: potential development on
private lands within the boundaries. The federal government may
never be able to afford the $3 billion or so it now will cost to
buy those lands, originally planned for purchase, officials have
testified.
   _Yellowstone, Wyo., Mont. and Idaho: nearby logging, oil
exploration and winter use by snowmobilers.
   _Yosemite, Calif.: congestion in Yosemite Valley, tourist
flights and nearby logging.
   Galvin of the park service said the society could be performing
a service calling attention to threats that might not be visible to
park visitors, ``but I don't know that we'd pick the same 10 parks.
... I don't know what purpose such a list serves except publicity.''
