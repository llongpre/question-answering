<LEADPARA>  AMERICA has a love affair with its national parks, and rightly so. They
preserve some of the most beautiful scenery in the country, and often
inexpensively.;    Camping is possible at most and, for those who prefer a
roof overhead, there are other bargains. Even the activities -- hiking,
fishing, climbing and boating -- tend to be inexpensive. One caveat, however:
Book as early as possible; lodgings can fill up months in advance for the
summer season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK -- Yosemite's fans consider the California
park the most beautiful place in the world, even when summer crowds fill
narrow Yosemite Valley. The scenery is spectacular, the waterfalls majestic.

electricity, the rate for two is $28.50 a night. Add $2 for each child through
age 12 and $4 for ages 13 and older. Shower and toilet facilities are nearby.
Also in the valley are cabins, a lodge and the luxurious Ahwahnee Hotel, where
the top rate is $421 a night. (209) 252-4848.;    (check) SHENANDOAH NATIONAL
PARK, Virginia -- The park is laced with interesting trails, many of them

CANYON NATIONAL PARK, South Rim, Arizona -- Many visitors take in the views of
the mile-deep canyon at midday and then depart. To see the canyon at its best
-- at dawn and dusk, when the colors are most intense -- you should plan to
stay overnight or for several days. Trails lead along the rim or down to the
Colorado River. At Bright Angel Lodge on the rim, a cabin for two without bath
is $33 a night. A cabin for four without bath at Maswik Lodge, a couple of
blocks back from the rim, is $40. Plushier accommodations on the rim are in
lodges and the historic El Tovar Hotel, where the top rate is $222 a night.
(602) 638-2401.;    (check) BRYCE CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Utah -- The canyon is
a fantastical world of spires, hoodoos, arches and other odd geological
formations all lavishly splashed in reds, pinks and oranges. You can explore
on escorted trail rides or on your own afoot. A room for two at Bryce Canyon
Lodge is $59.15 a night. A deluxe cabin is $69.90. Children 12 and under stay
free; add $5 for anyone 13 and older. (801) 586-7686.;    (check) YELLOWSTONE
NATIONAL PARK, Wyoming -- Old Faithful is the geyser everyone knows. But
Yellowstone is a geothermal wonderland, the biggest of its kind in the world.

Springs begins at about $20 a night for two people. Children 11 and under stay
free, and the rate is $7 for age 12 and older. A cabin with bath ranges from
$40 to $55 for two. The most expensive accommodations are at Lake Yellowstone
Hotel, where a room is $89 to $99 a night for two. (307) 344-7311.;    (check)
GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, Montana -- On back-country trails, hikers wear jingle
bells so they won't surprise the grizzlies. But don't let the wildlife
frighten you away. Glacier preserves a stunning array of glacially carved
lakes set at the base of a rugged ridge of mountain peaks. Cabins without bath
at Swiftcurrent Motor Inn begin at $21 a night for two, and a two-bedroom

226-5551.;    (check) MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, Washington -- Glacier has
the name, but you will see far more impressive glaciers on the slopes of
14,410-foot-high Mount Rainier, and they are easier to get to. At the
gorgeously rustic Paradise Inn, a room for two without bath is $50 a night;
with bath, $70. Add $9 for each child over age 2. (206) 569-2211.  </TEXT>
