   Tourists anticipating a
vacation weekend in majestic Yosemite National Park saw their plans
go up in smoke Friday as lightning-sparked fires ravaged thousands
of acres.
   An estimated 10,000 people were held inside the park overnight
because fires blocked roads in and out of the preserve. They were
escorted out Friday morning; some just ended their travels early
and headed home and others headed elsewhere.
   Fires triggered by more than 21,000 lightning strikes during the
week burned more than 100,000 acres across California, including
12,000 acres and 66 structures in Yosemite by Friday. Initial
estimates of the number of buildings consumed by the fires was much
lower but after an inspection Friday, officials determined many
more had burned.
   A National Guard helicopter crashed Friday evening while the
craft was scooping water out of a pond in Tehama County, where a
wildfire was burning, officials said. One of the three crew members
suffered minor injuries, they said.
   ``They suspect that it may have been engine failure,'' said
National Guard Major Patricia Antosh. ``The crew was able to
evacuate themselves through the cockpit and get to shore.''
   The aircraft remained two-thirds submerged with the tail section
down, according to Antosh.
   Norbert and Edith Fischer of Mission Viejo, Calif., had planned
to spend two days in Yosemite, which is observing its 100th
birthday this year. Instead, they decided to move on to Sequoia
National Park, 170 miles to the south.
   ``I'm a lot disappointed because I read a chapter about it in my
social studies book,'' said their 10-year-old daughter, Lori. ``The
teacher told me to go up and see it. Now, I can't see it.''
   Her father promised to drive the 300 miles from Los Angeles back
to the park again, ``hopefully next year.''
   Besides the Yosemite fires, a fire in northern California's
Tehama County had burned 39,000 acres and one in the Sequoia
National Forest affected 17,000.
   Fires also raged in parts of Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada,
Utah and Washington state. Nearly 16,000 lightning strikes were
reported in the Western states in 24 hours, according to the Boise
Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates fire control
efforts. The center said 19,000 firefighters were at work in the
West.
   Three villages in the Yosemite area were evacuated at various
times, and 66 structures burned in one of them, known as Foresta,
in the Merced River Canyon. Most of the structures were probably
summer cabins, said Lisa Boyd, spokeswoman at the state Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection command center in Sacramento.
   Many people were anxious to leave Yosemite on Friday because
most lights were out in the valley Thursday night. Some people
unable to get back to their campsites had to sleep on makeshift
beds on hotel floors or in their cars.
   ``I felt sorry for people up just for the day who couldn't get
out,'' said Joe Salazar of Santa Fe Springs, Calif. ``There were
lines and lines of traffic trying to get out of the valley. We've
been coming here for 17 years, from the driest to the wettest. I've
never seen so much lightning.''
   His wife, Vivian, said the experience of vacationing behind fire
lines ``was interesting. It was also frightening, though.''
   Rachel Chang and Michael Zheng of Fremont, Calif., slept in
their car in Yosemite Valley for two nights after the road to their
campground was closed. After they were escorted out, they returned
to the gate to ask how they could retrieve their tent, sleeping
bags and clothes.
   Park Ranger Kevin McMillan advised them to ``sit tight and keep
waiting.'' He took Chang's name, address and telephone number.
   ``I know it's a big inconvenience, but we've got to be glad we
don't have people trapped up there,'' McMillan said.
   Salazar said he would return to the park some day.
   ``By the time I come back, they'll have trees again,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in the West, government land managers in southern
Idaho banned campfires and smoking outside of campgrounds beginning
at midnight Sunday. In Washington state, the Department of Natural
Resources banned all outdoor burning in Pierce, Mason and Kitsap
counties to reduce the risk of forest fires.
   A 60,000-acre range fire had ripped an 18-mile-long path through
sagebrush and grass about 35 miles northeast of Twin Falls in
southern Idaho.
   ``It looked like a cyclone with black clouds and a wall of flame
rising about a thousand feet in the air,'' said Bureau of Land
Management spokesman Dale Chatterton.
   A 73,700-acre complex of fires in Oregon had burned to within
one mile of the town of Riley and within three miles northwest of
Burns, a town of about 3,000, and its southern neighbor, Hines, a
town of about 1,500, officials said.
   The few residents of Riley were evacuated Wednesday night.
   ``Burns is still prepared for an immediate evacuation, but for
the moment it doesn't appear to be necessary,'' fire information
officer Don Jackson said Friday.
   There were nearly 1,000 people battling the fires Friday morning
and officials said two 500-member battalions from the Army's 1st
Division were scheduled to arrive in Burns during the weekend.
