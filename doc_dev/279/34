<LEADPARA>  Some conservationists have criticized a proposal to renovate the east
auditorium of the Visitor Center in Yosemite National Park to accommodate a
large film screen, saying a new movie about the park will degrade the park
experience.;   Marc Francis, the new chairman of the Sierra Club's Yosemite
Task Force, said the conservation club opposes a park-service plan to produce
a "sensationalized, Hollywood-style" film.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     No cost to government; In February, the National Park Service signed an
agreement with Multi-Image Corp. of Southern California to produce the $4
million film -- at no cost to the government.;   Len McKenzie, the chief park
interpreter, said the 70-mm film -- which is twice the size of the average
feature film -- would contribute to visitors' understanding and interpretation
of Yosemite.;   "It would be no different from the automatic audio-visual
presentation we now have in the park," he said.;   However, Francis accused
the Park Service of attempting to increase park visitation at a time when
Yosemite Valley already has too many visitors.;   "Why are they doing this? It
will only short-change the visitor and cheapen the Yosemite experience," he
said.;   The Sierra Club official suggested that the film would lead to some
type of "industrial tourism.";   McKenzie disagreed, pointing out that the
Park Service will have full control over the script and filming.;   The Park
Service already has made a number of reviews of the script and several more
draft versions are anticipated, he explained.;   The film would augment the
slide presentations on the park that Eastman Kodak Co. has done over the
years. There have been "very few complaints," McKenzie said.;   The selection
of Multi-Image as the producer also drew complaints from Francis and Al Runte,
a former Yosemite ranger, author of "Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness," and
frequent park critic.;   Both questioned why there was no open solicitation or
request for a proposal by other potential producers or film makers.;   "Where
are the film makers with a proven environmental record, such as Ken Ruth,
Robert Redford or Al Runte?" Runte asked.;   "Why was the selection not a
public one? I don't trust a secret process.";   He also said the big-film
approach is not what park interpretation is all about.;   'Hollywood
production'; Runte suggested that the film would be a "Hollywood production,"
rather than one that emphasized park values of preservation and protection.;  
"It's all smoke and mirrors.";   Under the tentative agreement, Multi-Image
has agreed to raise $3 million from corporate sponsors to produce the film and
$1 million to convert the existing auditorium in Yosemite Valley.;   In
return, the company would have the right to sell prints and videocassettes of
the film anywhere in the world except in Yosemite or other Park Service
sites.;   Filming could begin as early as this winter and conclude in 1993. As
for increasing park visitation, the park official said "it's already heavy,
and at some time day-use limits are going to be imposed.";   McKenzie said no
decision has been made whether to charge park visitors to see the film. If
there is a charge, revenues would go to the Yosemite Association, a non-profit
organization that supports park activities.;   He said the Park Service signed
a memorandum of understanding with Multi-Image Corp. earlier this year,
following discussions that have been under way for more than a year.;  
Seventy theaters around the world are capable of projecting large-format
films, including Grand Canyon and Yellowstone national parks.  </TEXT>
