   Tourists casually packed
their cars and evacuated the Old Faithful complex today as a
wind-blown wildfire roared less than a mile away, while a river of
fire flowed within feet of two small towns on Yellowstone's
northern border.
   It was the first time in Yellowstone's 116-year history that
evacuations had been ordered near Old Faithful, park officials said.
   The tourists at Old Faithful couldn't see any flames today
because a ridge blocked their view, but park spokeswoman Marsha
Karle said the smoke in the park made it ``harder and harder to
breathe.''
   The 500 to 600 visitors and non-essential employees at the hotel
and campground complex near the park's most popular attraction were
ordered to leave for safety reasons and to allow firefighters the
access they need to protect structures, says spokeswoman Joan
Anzelmo.
   ``This is not a panic at all,'' she said.
   Wendy Morrison of Scottsdale, Ariz., said a bellman knocked on
her door at 6:45 a.m. and told her the National Park Service was
evacuating the area.
   ``We kind of figured it was coming so it was not too much of a
shock,'' Morrison said. ``We got in yesterday and were planning to
stay through tomorrow.''
   Winds gusting to 30 mph pushed the 144,700-acre North Fork blaze
to within three-quarters of a mile of the complex early today.
Embers carried by the wind started spot fires even nearer to the
famed geyser.
   Firefighters in Cooke City, Mont., where the giant Storm Creek
fire surged out of the park, hoped today that a stiff west wind
wouldn't shift enough to fan the flames across a 20-foot firebreak
separating the fire from the tiny tourist towns of Cooke City and
Silver Gate at the park's northeast corner.
   Overnight, wind blew parallel to the narrow east-west firebreak,
and firefighters channeled the fire past the northern edge of
Silver Gate.
   By this morning, the fire's leading edge was past Silver Gate
and within a quarter mile of Cooke City, but still following the
10- to 20-foot-wide firebreak channel.
   sked how close the fire was to buildings, fire information
officer Dave McMorran said: ``Zero. It's right up behind the
buildings.''
   Officials hoped the fire's scorched path would protect the towns
from a return.
   At the Old Faithful complex, officials are confident they can
protect structures from the advancing flames. These include the
historic, wooden Old Faithful Inn, two other lodges, hundreds of
cabins, a general store, a service station and a clinic.
   On Tuesday, soldiers laid a 4,000-foot irrigation line to wet
down the area to divert the flames.
   The blaze is among 13 major fires that have burned roughly 1
million acres this summer in Yellowstone and the surrounding
national forests in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Inside the 2.2
million-acre park, 634,000 acres are charred.
   Firefighters wetted down buildings in Cooke City and Silver Gate
as the 63,000-acre Storm Creek fire surged out of the park. Both
towns, with a combined year-round population of 150, were ordered
evacuated earlier Tuesday as the fire threatened from 1{ miles away.
   Wind-blown embers landed on buildings but were quickly doused by
firefighters, who waged a nightlong effort to save the community.
   Some firefighters sprayed rooftops just above a portable sign
that read: ``Give it hell, guys. It ain't over 'til it's over.''
   Firefighters cut Silver Gate's power Tuesday night to prevent
the downing of live power lines. The town was lit only by
spotlights, and the orange glow of the spot fire 200 yards away was
bright enough to read by.
   David Liebersbach, fire commander at Silver Gate, estimated
firefighters had a 25 percent chance of saving the town.
   Other Montana fires also forced evacuations.
   The 66,000-plus-acre Canyon Creek fire in west-central Montana
grew so quickly that officials had no accurate idea of its size,
said Jane Weber of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The growth
prompted an evacuation of an undetermined number of cabins.
   More than 30 cabins southwest of Augusta were ordered evacuated,
Weber said. To the southwest across the Scapegoat Wilderness, the
Canyon Creek fire forced evacuations north of Ovando, about 75
miles northwest of Helena. And officials evacuated about 10 homes
near a new fire eight miles west of Glacier National Park.
   In southwest Montana, firefighters began evacuating 12 to 15
homes west of Darby as the Little Rock Creek fire spread to more
than 1,000 acres in the Bitterroot National Forest. The fire was
about two miles from Darby today, but the town was not considered
threatened, said fire information officer Paul Gyles.
   Gov. Ted Schwinden on Tuesday banned all outdoor recreation
outside Montana's cities and towns due to the fire danger.
   Elsewhere, a fire in parched grass and pine in central
Washington exploded from 160 acres Monday to more than 25,000 acres
Tuesday, sending firefighters fleeing, destroying at least one
house and forcing the evacuation of a dozen others. State officials
closed, but later re-opened, 40 miles of nearby U.S. 97 due to
smoke.
   The fire, the largest of several in Washington, burned toward
some of the state's prime fruit orchards.
   In Idaho, wind whipped a fire in the Nez Perce National Forest
from 25,900 acres Monday to 36,780 by Tuesday night.
   Campgrounds were evacuated about 225 miles north of San
Francisco in the King Mountain Range, where a 1,150-acre fire was
burning and firefighters continued today to mop up the remnants of
wildfires that blackened more than 25,000 acres in Southern
California. Forests and grassland also burned in Oregon and Utah.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, the coordinating office for
firefighting in the West, said fires this year have charred 3.65
million acres, an area larger than Connecticut. Slightly more than
2 million of the acres are in Alaska. During the last big fire
season, 1985, 2.8 million acres burned. The fire center has called
this the worst fire season in 30 years.
