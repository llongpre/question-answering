   Firefighters contained
several major forest fires Wednesday and experts said they were
confident the blazes will soon be fully controlled.
   Three big fires in Yosemite National Park were all expected to
be contained within lines of bare earth by Friday night, officials
said. The park was closed to visitors Aug. 9 because of the fire
danger.
   The park will be partly reopened Friday, officials announced. A
highway through the park across the Sierra Nevada range will be
opened, but Yosemite Valley, the main tourist destination, will
remain closed until at least Monday.
   For the third day in a row, fire bosses gave highest priority to
the Finley Lake fire in Tehama County in northern California, which
had burned 21,880 acres as of Wednesday and was 70 percent
contained. There was no estimate of when the fire burning 230 miles
northeast of San Francisco would be contained, said Dwayne Collier
of the California Department of Forestry.
   The Finley Lake fire, which threatened about 1,600 homes earlier
this week, was within four miles of the town of Manton but it
didn't appear to pose a threat, Collier said.
   Forest and range fires also burned in parts of Alaska, Arizona,
Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon and Washington state, said the
National Fire Information Center in Boise, Idaho. So far this year,
the Boise Interagency Fire Center has shipped 1.9 million tons of
firefighting supplies at a cost of $11.3 million, officials said.
   In Yosemite, the A-Rock fire, which burned across 17,000 acres,
was 70 percent contained Wednesday and was expected to be fully
contained by Friday evening, said Collier.
   The Steamboat fire, which burned 4,400 acres and was 60 percent
contained, was expected to be fully contained by Thursday evening,
he said.
   The T-Grove 4 fire, covering 4,700 acres, was 90 percent
contained with full containment expected by Thursday night, Collier
said.
   Other small fires also burned in the 757,000-acre park, but none
on the valley floor where tourists congregate. A total of 22,100
acres in the park had been burned as of Wednesday, Collier said.
   The T-Grove 4 fire was less than two miles from Merced Grove, a
stand of ancient sequoia trees, but didn't pose an immediate threat
to the grove, Collier said.
   However, smaller trees burning along the park's roads might keep
the park closed, officials said.
   Burning trees were still toppling onto roads, said Janet Buzzini
of the U.S. Parks Service.
   ``We cannot open the park until we get those closest to the
roads down,'' she said, adding that falling rocks, crews and
equipment posed additional hazards. ``It's really not safe yet.''
   The first of 1,200 Army troops from the 4th Infantry Division in
Fort Carson, Colo., began arriving Tuesday to help with the Finley
fire.
   Tehama County, the Campbell complex fire _ the largest of the
siege of fires that spread across the northern part of the state
this month _ had burned across 115,000 acres and was 85 percent
contained Wednesday, Collier said.
   In the community of Foresta near Yosemite, 66 homes were burned
earlier this week.
   A total of 250,956 acres of California has been burned by an
estimated 1,300 wildfires since Aug. 3.
