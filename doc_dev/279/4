   Sequoia and Kings Canyon
national parks, which adjoin each other in the Sierra, are the
first to resume a policy of letting some lightning fires burn
themselves out, officials said Monday.
   A National Park Service policy to let selected fires burn
naturally was suspended last year following criticism over letting
wildfires get out of control in Yellowstone National Park.
   The suspension has been lifted only at Sequoia and Kings Canyon
following approval by Regional Director Lew Albert of a revised
fire management plan for the parks 200 miles north of Los Angeles,
said spokesman William Tweed.
   Based on an environmental assessment, Albert found that resuming
the policy would have no signficant environmental impact.
   Fires will be allowed to burn only within specific ranges of
temperature, wind speed and fuel moisture, Tweed said. Enough
firefighters must be on hand to put a fire out if necessary.
   ``The goal of the program is to perpetuate the role of natural
fire in park ecosystems without threatening public safety or
property,'' Tweed said in a statement.
