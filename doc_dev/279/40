   Here is a summary of developments in forest and brush fires in
Western states:

<HEAD>WYOMING:</HEAD>

   Fire gutted 17 buildings at Yellowstone National Park's Old
Faithful geyser complex Wednesday. About 200 firefighters protected
other structures, including the historic Old Faithful Inn.
   Overnight visitors to Old Faithful were asked to leave Wednesday
morning in the first-ever evacuation of the most popular tourist
attraction at the 116-year-old park.
   The nearby 165,000-acre North Fork fire is one of 13 major
blazes covering more than 1 million acres in and around Yellowstone.
   East of Yellowstone, Shoshone National Forest officials
evacuated at least 50 ranches and summer homes in a sparsely
populated area because of rapid growth of the 260,000-acre Clover
Mist fire.

   Two men were reported missing west of Glacier National Park
early today as flames raced near their remote home.
   The blaze, discovered Tuesday, expanded to an estimated 7,500
acres by early today and moved into the park. There it burned a
ranger station complex and numerous cabins.
   Four hikers in the park were rescued by helicopter Wednesday
after flames cut off their escape route. More than 100 people were
evacuated because of the blaze, and two park campgrounds were
evacuated and closed.
   Along Yellowstone's northern border, high winds drove a
deliberately set backfire along the northern edge of Cooke City and
nearby Silver Gate. The fire singed the fringes of the Montana
towns but created a buffer zone of charred timber in advance of the
119,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire.
   Elsewhere, winds sent wildfires boiling through timber in the
Bitterroot Range near the Idaho line, northeast of Ovando along the
Continental Divide, and in a wide area to the north and south of
Augusta along the Rocky Mountain Front. Dozens of people were
evacuated from homes in the paths of the blazes.

   A number of fires in the Frank Church-River of No Return
Wilderness reached nearly 60,000 acres. To the north, seven fires
continued to burn out of control in the Nez Perce National Forest,
covering nearly 89,000 acres.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Prime fruit orchards were spared from a raging forest fire in
central Washington state by farmers turning on their irrigation
systems, by a shift in winds and by cooler weather.
   The dampened apple and pear orchards near the Columbia River
town of Entiat helped keep the spreading 32,000-acre fire from all
but one home, which was destroyed.
   About 700 firefighters used bulldozers in an attempt to ring the
fire, while aircraft and helicopters bombed it with water and flame
retardant. The fire is the largest of a half-dozen in Washington
that burned 65,000 acres.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters declared the lightning-caused Teepee Butte fire in
northeastern Oregon under control after it burned nearly 60,000
acres of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon
National Recreation Area over the past two weeks. It was the
state's largest blaze.

<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Crews set a backfire north of Shelter Cove to protect the
coastal tourist town from a stubborn blaze that swept out of
control over 1,600 acres of the rugged King Mountain Range, about
225 miles north of San Francisco.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UTAH:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters contained a 5,400-acre brush fire east of Salt Lake
City, but scrambled to battle seven new fires in the state,
including one that destroyed a cabin and a barn north of White
Rocks in eastern Utah.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COLORADO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Five wildfires whipped by gusting winds spread rapidly Wednesday
along Colorado's northeastern mountains and foothills, forcing
evacuation of 25 homes north of Golden and an undetermined number
of people from a Boulder County Boy Scout camp.
   There were no reports of property damage, and a total of about
4,800 acres were charred statewide.
