   A fire that has charred a
35-mile swath across the heart of Yellowstone National Park
threatened one of the park's most picturesque areas and forced out
hundreds of visitors, officials said Wednesday.
   The rapidly burning North Fork fire, which started July 23 in
Idaho's Targhee National Forest, grew to nearly 100,000 acres and
forced the closure Wednesday morning of the Canyon area.
   Winds expected to reach 50 mph Wednesday in the park failed to
materialize, and by nightfall the fire remained one mile to the
west of the area, which is located a bit north of the center of the
60-mile-square park.
   Elsewhere, crews southeast of Helena, Mont., said they expected
to contain the 37,600-acre Warm Springs Creek blaze by Friday
evening; and in Idaho, air tankers and fire crews fought a surging,
1,000-acre blaze on the slopes of Hells Canyon, the nation's
deepest gorge.
   The closure of Canyon, Yellowstone's largest development with
600 cabins and 280 campsites, sent more than 700 visitors and
employees to other parts of the park.
   ``My children are all excited about it,'' said tourist Allen
Jones, of Staffordshire, England. ``It didn't detract from our
visit at all.''
   By midmorning Wednesday, only firefighters and reporters
remained at Canyon, and the buzzing of chain saws filled the air as
crews hurriedly removed downed trees and undergrowth. Smoke in the
air partially obscured the view of the 308-foot Lower Falls and
109-foot Upper Falls.
   Fire officials said they hoped to keep the North Fork fire
burning to the north of the Canyon area, but feared that embers
could bring the blaze right into Canyon.
   Michelle Rotter, a park service public information officer, said
the North Fork fire could then conceivably burn from Canyon and
into the area blackened by the Clover Mist fire some miles to the
east, in effect cutting the park virtually in two.
   Although not the biggest of the 10 fires that have burned more
than 354,000 acres in Yellowstone, the North Fork blaze has become
the most dangerous to structures. Firefighters previously had come
near to containing the fire, but the lack of rainfall combined with
winds gusting to 60 mph repeatedly have fanned it out of control.
   The 156,500-acre Clover Mist fire earlier this week swung into
the Shoshone National Forest east of Yellowstone. In the national
forest, 635 Army regulars were working with professional
firefighters to halt the advance.
   The so-called Snake Complex of fires, which includes the Red,
Shoshone and Falls fires in southern Yellowstone, spread over
80,000 acres by Wednesday. While forcing the closure of the Grant
Village area and the park's south entrance, the fires were not
threatening any structures.
   Fires also posed threats both north and south of the park.
   To the south in Grand Teton National Park and the Bridger-Teton
National Forest, firefighters dwarfed by 150-foot walls of flame
battled to keep the 12,600-acre Huck fire from crossing into
Yellowstone about 1{ miles away. The fire had more than doubled in
size from Tuesday to Wednesday.
   Just over the Montana line north of the park, nearly 600
additional firefighters and a top-level fire-management team from
Alaska arrived Wednesday to take over the 27,000-acre Storm Creek
fire. The blaze is burning out of control in a wilderness area
seven miles north of Cooke City, a town near the northeast corner
of the park.
   Near Helena, crews had expected to contain the 37,600-acre Warm
Springs Creek blaze Wednesday night, but pushed the deadline back
two days because of one troublesome area along the fire lines, fire
information officer Bob Krepps said. The 2-week-old fire has burned
more than a dozen structures.
   ``Once that's done and held, there's nothing much left to cause
us any problem,'' Krepps said Wednesday. ``We're getting close. The
noose is tightening.''
   In Idaho, more than 400 firefighters were committed to the Eagle
Bar blaze in Hells Canyon, which was burning out of control with no
containment target in sight. The blaze made two significant runs
Wednesday, moving into the Deep Creek drainage containing 12
million board feet of timber and toward the base camp at Kinney
Point.
   In southern Oregon, a fire in Crater Lake National Park that
charred 85 acres Tuesday grew to more than 1,000 acres Wednesday,
burning across the park boundary into neighboring Winema National
Forest.
   In central Oregon, firefighters nearly contained a blaze that
charred 110 acres and forced the brief evacuation of three homes,
but several lightning-caused blazes elsewhere in the state were
reported out of control.
   In southwestern Washington, calmer winds and cooler temperatures
allowed firefighters to cut a containment line around 75 percent of
a 500-acre fire 30 miles southwest of Mount Rainier National Park,
officials said. The fire grew from 60 acres to 500 on Tuesday
thanks to gusty wind, 100-degree air and low humidity.
