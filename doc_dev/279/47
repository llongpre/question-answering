   Author Stephen King may be a master of
the macabre, but he's not so bad at one-liners.
   ``People want to know why I do this, why I write such gross
stuff,'' King told 2,300 fans at City Hall on Tuesday night. ``I
like to tell them I have the heart of a small boy, and I keep it in
a jar on my desk.''
   King, who was taking part in the city library's centennial
celebrations, said some people pay psychiatrists to tell them
``their most twisted fantasies.''
   ``I, on the other hand, write them down, and they pay me. It's a
great way to live,'' said the author of such chillers as
``Carrie,'' ``The Shining,'' ``The Dead Zone,'' and ``Cujo.''
   ``People want to know if I have nightmares,'' he said. ``Of
course not. I give them to you.''
   Then there are those who are curious about King's reading habits.
   ``Somebody will walk up to you, usually in a restaurant _ I
usually read a book when I eat _ and say, `How come you're not
reading one of your own?'
   ``Think about it. Because I know how they come out. Every last
one!''

   Environmentalists want Bob Hope to donate his
7,400 acres of land in the Santa Monica Mountains to a national
preserve, but the 86-year-old entertainer wants to turn a profit.
   Hope, the largest private landholder in the coastal range north
of Los Angeles, has optioned most of the land he acquired in the
1950s to developers who plan golf courses and high-priced homes,
said Payson Wolff, an attorney for Hope.
   ``Mr. Hope regards his properties as investments, and he is
fully entitled to a fair return on them,'' Wolff said Tuesday.
``It's presumptuous for people to say that he should give his land
away. ... If he wants to sell it, more power to him.''
   Supporters of a vast Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area, which includes an ocean-front stretch near Malibu, say
acquiring Hope's land is crucial, because the National Park Service
cannot compete with developers.
   ``Of all the lands you can get in the mountains, Hope has the
critical ones,'' said Joseph T. Edmiston, director of the state-run
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which works with the park
service to acquire land.
   One 339-acre oceanfront tract in Malibu's Corral Canyon is under
option to a company that plans a golf course and resort. Another,
the 1,300-acre Jordan Ranch in the Agoura Hills, has been valued at
$20 million to $30 million.
   The park service has set aside $12 million this year for
acquiring land in the Santa Monica Mountains, and $15 million has
been contributed by the conservancy.

   The state Supreme Court on Wednesday
upheld Johnny Paycheck's seven- to 9{-year sentence in the 1985
shooting of another barroom patron in southern Ohio.
   Authorities said Paycheck, best known for his 1978 hit ``Take
This Job and Shove It,'' pulled out a pistol in the Hillsboro
lounge on Dec. 19, 1985, and fired a shot after interpreting a
remark as an insult, wounding Larry Wise in the scalp. Paycheck was
sent to the Chillicothe Correctional Institute on Feb. 7, 1989,
with no chance of parole for at least five years and eight months.
   The country crooner originally was charged with felonious
assault involving the use of a gun, but a jury convicted him of a
lesser offense of aggravated assault. He also was convicted of
tampering with evidence.
   In an appeal, lawyers for Paycheck argued that he should not
have been given a mandatory three-year sentence for use of a
firearm. They contended the lesser charge did not provide for the
firearm specification.
   The court ruled that a firearm specification in the assault
charge applied to other lesser charges against him. The opinion
said that when a person is charged with a felony, the indictment
``necessarily and simultaneously charges the defendant with the
lesser offenses as well.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has accepted Brown
University's invitation to speak on campus, a State Department
official said Wednesday, but the school is refusing to comment.
   The State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that Gorbachev had agreed in
principle to speak at the Ivy League school, but it was unclear
whether the Soviet president would be available to speak at Brown's
commencement in late May.
   ``The timing of Brown's commencement does not coincide with
plans for the summit,'' said the official.
   Gorbachev and President Bush plan to meet in the United States
in June, but probably not until late in the month.
   School officials have refused any comment since reports of
Gorbachev's possible visit surfaced Tuesday.
   ``We still don't feel we can say anything,'' said Robert
Reichley, when told about the State Department official's comment.
``I can't tell you what the reason is.''
   On Tuesday, a congressional source also said Gorbachev had
agreed to accept an honorary degree from Brown, but no date had
been set.

   The family of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
criticized the British musical ``King,'' saying it trivializes the
legacy of the slain civil rights leader.
   A spokesman for the King family said Tuesday the family ``feels
strongly that there has been no meeting of the minds'' despite
years of discussions with a team of writers, producers and
directors.
   ``The family believes that the musical falls short of the
historical authenticity and that it trivializes Dr. King's
legacy,'' spokesman Kent Matlock of Matlock &amp; Associates Inc. said
in a statement.
   Matlock said the King family would provide no authorization for
the musical or the stage play soundtrack.
   The statement indicated that musical is produced by the London,
England-based production group, Multi Media AG and Hargitay Group
Holdings AG.
