<TEXT>     As impractical as it may be, the closing of Yosemite might be what is
needed to trigger a serious movement to save it and other national parks that
are overrun by tourists and concessionaires.;    The "endangered" parks most
frequently mentioned along with Yosemite are Yellowstone and Grand Canyon.
Even though vast areas of the parks lie mostly untouched -- except by
pollution, much of it created by motor vehicles -- there are those who worry
that the most heavily used areas of the parks have become too busy and
commercial.;    Yosemite, with such splendid wonders as El Capitan, Half Dome,
Sentinel Rock and the 620-foot Bridalveil Fall, appears to have been
transformed into a rideless amusement park themed to forests, mountains and
glaciated valleys.;    The U.S. Department of the Interior's National Park
Service was created 75 years ago to protect our wilderness areas as a natural
legacy. In reality, the government has allowed commercialism to cater to
ever-growing numbers of visitors. In the process, it has helped to create the
mini-malls in parks that erode the idyllic experiences it is supposed to
protect.;    A plan is needed;  Granted, it would be difficult, though not
impossible, to trash Yosemite's 761,757 acres of wilderness. But 94 percent of
Yosemite's more than 3 million annual visitors cram into California's Yosemite
Valley, seven miles long and a mile wide -- an area that's less than 1 percent
of the park.;    On any given day, there are 10,000 to 20,000 people in the
valley, said Kris Fister, a Yosemite spokeswoman, who acknowledged the park
"needs a better transportation plan without damaging the resources.";    By
not curbing attendance, the park service and Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., the
concessionaire that caters to tourists, have created a monster -- too many
cars, people and concessions in a limited space with inadequate controls.;   
As the park service marks its 75th anniversary, more critics are viewing the
parks more closely. What they see, they don't like.;    "There are too many
people coming to parks doing the wrong things," said Michael Frome, author,
professor and national park expert. "They treat the parks like popcorn
playgrounds. They don't understand what the national parks mean.";    'Solemn
cathedral';    Yosemite, described by President Theodore Roosevelt as a
"great, solemn cathedral," recently was the focal point of an ABC News
"Nightline" program, "Our National Parks in Danger." Guests included Robert
Redford, actor/environmentalist; Alfred Runte, environmental historian; and
James Ridenour, National Park Service director, an Indiana political associate
of Vice President Dan Quayle's.;    Yosemite Valley still retains its natural
wonders, but its solemnity disappears when you're locked in bumper-to-bumper
traffic that's more akin to Los Angeles. The sense of place has changed, based
on the "Nightline" report and other accounts. The sheer number of people and
cars vying for space leads to frustration and diminishes the "cathedral"
atmosphere.;    "There's a very urban feeling here," Leslie Estes of Yosemite
Action, an environmentalist and former park ranger, said on "Nightline.";   
What followed in the "Nightline" report stirred anger: that within Yosemite
Valley are 10 stores that sell souvenirs, 20 places that sell liquor and
another 14 where you can buy food.;    Michael Finley, Yosemite's
superintendent, defended the concessions on "Nightline." He said, "The most
serious problems are not visitors. Our most serious problems are external in
nature, as are most problems to parks -- air quality, air pollution.";    "But
the people in the valley and the cars in the valley and the campfires in the
valley are part of the problem too," Estes countered.;    The traffic
generates big business for Curry Co., whose 30-year sweetheart concession
contract expires in 1993. "Nightline" reported that Curry pays the government
about 75 cents on every $100 it makes. Last year Curry made an estimated $85
million and paid the government $635,000.;    Another distressing fact that
colors today's Yosemite:;    Yosemite has a 22-bed jail that holds an average
of five prisoners a day. The park has a full-time U.S. magistrate. Murder,
rape, assault and drug dealing are among the crimes park rangers must cope
with, instead of interpreting nature to visitors.;    Redford lamented that
Yosemite lost its purity since he first saw the park years ago, the result of
development unchecked.;    Runte, the environmental historian, blamed the
original park legislation that set aside the land for preservation, public use
and recreation for all time, but then allowed concessionaires 10-year leases
to provide food and lodging.;    Ridenour conceded that "you probably don't
need all that stuff and that's what our goal is, to begin to reduce the
footprint not only of the concessionaires at Yosemite, but of the National
Park Service as well.";    What should be done to save Yosemite and the other
national parks? Runte and others have suggested that the park service be
removed from the politicized Interior Department and be administered by a
private citizens' commission, as the Smithsonian Institution and Library of
Congress are.;    Some have suggested that access to the parks be limited.;   
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said on another ABC news show a few days later
that he didn't think it was a good idea to remove the park service from
Interior, nor did he see the possibility of limiting access.;    "Yosemite
National Park. Closed"? Despite what Lujan said, it's not impossible.  </TEXT>
