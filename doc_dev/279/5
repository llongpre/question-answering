   A record number of
tourists visited Yosemite National Park last year while nearby
Kings Canyon and Sequoia parks came close to their best years ever.
   Yosemite attracted 3,429,619 visitors, a 3 percent increase from
1988, said Michael V. Finley, the park's new superintendent, who
said 70 percent of the visitors come from California, 20 percent
from abroad and the remaining 10 percent from other states.
   Both Kings Canyon and Sequoia national parks, south of Yosemite
in the central Sierra Nevada, topped 1 million visitors in 1989 for
the fourth straight year, the parks' statistics showed.
