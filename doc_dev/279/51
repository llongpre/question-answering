   Fires raged out of control in eight states today and more than
600 people fled a Nebraska park where a lightning-sparked blaze
burned to within a half-mile of the historic fort where Sioux Chief
Crazy Horse was killed.
   A blaze also threatened the ancient Indian cliff dwellings of
Mesa Verde in Colorado, and an arson fire swept toward the Ventana
wilderness in the mountains rising from Big Sur, 120 miles south of
San Francisco.
   Major fires also were burning in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
Oregon and Wyoming.
   Cooler temperatures and rain helped nearly extinguish wilderness
fires in Montana and Alaska.
   In northwestern Nebraska, about 100 firefighters battled the
biggest fire in the West, a 50,000-acre blaze that leapfrogged along
a 22-mile front at Fort Robinson State Park. About 30 National
Guardsmen entered the fray after Gov. Kay Orr declared a disaster
area.
   The flames leapt through the rugged canyons, leaving splotches of
charred ground mixed with stretches of grass and stands of timber.
   ``There's a limit to what humans can do to fight a fire when it's
in those canyons,'' said state Sen. Sandy Scofield, who lives
nearby. ``Those pine trees are like kerosene-drenched torches.''
   Four patients were evacuated from a hospital and 25 from a
nursing home in Crawford, a nearby town of 1,300 people. One
firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation, but his condition was
not serious, said deputy state fire marshal Jerry Larson.
   ``The main body of the fire has been contained, but there are
fingers burning out there'' still out of control, he said this
morning.
   By early today, the fire had consumed nearly half the 22,000-acre
park and spurs of the fire were within half a mile of Fort Robinson,
the former cavalry post where Crazy Horse was killed by guards in
1877. The fort now serves as a lodge.
   The fire made a mushroom-shaped cloud of smoke that could be seen
from Scottsbluff, about 90 miles away.
   ``It's not a pretty sight, but these people have things well
under control,'' said Orr, after flying around the edges of the
blaze.
   ``We could see whole lines of trees exploding,'' said Marc
Anthony, a state game and parks commissioner who also flew over the
area.
   More than 600 people were evacuated from the park because of the
dense smoke, said Fort Robinson Superintendent Vince Rotherham. Most
were campers.
   Near Big Sur, in California, 600 firefighters using bulldozers,
helicopters and air tankers struggled with heavy brush on the steep,
roadless hillsides. They expected to have the blaze controlled by
tonight, said Lonnie Smith, a forestry spokesman in King City.
   The fire was set with an incendiary device, Smith said Sunday.
   ``There was no fog this morning, so that helped the fire just
romp all night,'' he said.
   A wind-fanned wildfire charred 3,500 acres of remote brush and
destroyed seven buildings in Lassen County, about 300 miles
northeast of San Francisco, and another consumed 2,000 acres of
timber in the nearby Plumas National Forest.
   A brush fire scorched more than 3,000 acres Sunday in the Laguna
Mountains, 40 miles east of San Diego.
   In Arizona, rain helped firefighters contain a 9,200-acre fire in
and around the Saguaro National Monument east of Tucson, and four
other fires were nearly under control late Sunday. But about 40,000
acres of forest and range land, from the Grand Canyon to Mexico,
burned on. A 1,000-acre blaze briefly threatened President Theodore
Roosevelt's hunting cabin in Grand Canyon.
   A brush fire eight miles west of Boulder, Colo., destroyed 42
structures and forced 200 people to flee. Two firefighters were
treated for smoke inhalation.
   Gov. Roy Romer issued an executive order Sunday night banning all
open fires west of Interstate 25, which bisects the state.
   In Mesa Verde National Park, archaeologists were helping
firefighters protect ancient Indian cliff dwellings from a fire that
had grown to 2,350 acres. The 12th century structures are among the
oldest in the United States, built by an unknown people who later
disappeared.
   The Diamond Creek fire, which consumed some 12,500 acres in
eastern Utah, was 80 percent contained by Sunday morning, said Mary
Plumb, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Land Management's Moab
District.
   Higher humidity and less wind helped firefighters get the upper
hand on a 10,000-acre fire in the Gila National Forest in
southwestern New Mexico.
   A fire in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming slowed
thanks partly to cooler weather Sunday.
   More than 350 firefighters fought two blazes in Fremont National
Forest in Oregon.
