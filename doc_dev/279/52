<LEADPARA>  IF THE idea of spending half your vacation time cooped up in a car with
feuding kids in the back seat makes you weary, take heart -- there are plenty
of getaways that can take you far away from family routines without
necessarily taking you too far from home. For example:;    (check) HOUSEBOAT
IN THE SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN RIVER DELTA -- You can live a lifetime in
Northern California without ever experiencing the otherworldliness of the
delta, but why should you? More than 1,500 miles of navigable waterways and
nearly as many islands await -- but you have to have a boat to explore them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Numerous companies make that possible with houseboat rentals that let you
meander through the delta at your own pace. You can stop to fish or swim
wherever the waters seem most inviting, tie up at an island for an evening
barbecue and sleep either in the cabin or under the stars on deck.;   
Three-day houseboat rentals through Delta Country Houseboats in Walnut Grove,
(916) 776-1741, start at $700 for a 47-foot craft. The weekly rate is $1,400,
but the boat sleeps 10, so two families could go together. Paradise Point
Marina in Stockton, (209) 952-1000, charges $430 until June 13 or $625
thereafter to rent a 46-foot boat for three days. The weekly rate is $1,050;
the boat sleeps six.;    Fuel costs extra for a houseboat rental (figure about
$40 for three days, unless you do more than the average amount of cruising).
Some companies also charge separately for generator use, so be sure when
shopping around to find out what's included. Renters must supply their own
linens. For leads on other companies that rent houseboats, check with the
chambers of commerce in Stockton, Walnut Grove, Petaluma, Isleton, Rio Vista
or other delta communities.;    (check) GO TO CAMP -- If a family getaway in
the mountains sounds inviting, but the thought of preparing meals and washing
dishes every day sounds like a drag, you can always opt for middle ground and
choose a family camp.;    If you really feel like spoiling yourself, try
Montecito-Sequoia High Sierra Vacation Camp, between Sequoia and Kings Canyon
national parks, 65 miles east of Fresno on Highway 180. Visitors can choose
accommodations in the main lodge or in rustic or screened cabins. There's a
small lake on the property for canoeing, sailing or water skiing, plus a
swimming pool, tennis courts and an extensive activities program. Weekly rates
(including meals) are $450 per adult, $425 for ages 13-17, $400 for ages 3-12
and $220 for kids under 3 for the least expensive accommodation in low season.
More affordable is the opening miniweek (June 17-21) package, priced from $255
per adult, $240 ages 13-17, $225 ages 3-12 and $100 for kids under 3. Miniweek
packages also are offered on selected dates in July and August. For details,
call the camp at (800) 227-9900.;    (check) TAKE A TRAIN TO SAN FRANCISCO --
Can't afford to roam too far this year? Maybe it's time to take the kids to
San Francisco and do all those things you've been promising to do on that
someday that never comes. Visit the Exploratorium and the zoo, hike across the
Golden Gate Bridge, tour the ships at Hyde Street Pier. Instead of driving,
though, consider making it a real adventure by taking CalTrain or Amtrak.;   
CalTrain service up the Peninsula to Fourth and Townsend streets in San
Francisco runs 10-12 times a day on weekends (27 times weekdays); the fare is
$6 round trip or $3.50 one way; those over 65 and children 12 and under pay
$3.50 round trip or $1.75 one way. For more information, call (800) 558-8661.;
   If you're willing to pay more for something out of the routine, Amtrak
trains make one trip daily in each direction between San Jose and San
Francisco. Round-trip fares are $23 for adults; children 2-15 ride for half
price. Passengers transfer in Oakland to an Amtrak shuttle bus that delivers
them to the Trans-Bay Terminal at 425 Mission (near First) in San Francisco.
For more information, call (800) USA-RAIL.;    To find a San Francisco hotel
that won't break your budget, you might contact San Francisco Reservations, a
booking agency that maintains information on scores of properties in all price
ranges, at (800) 333-8996.;    (check) GIVE IN TO DISNEY -- If the kids have
been clamoring for Disneyland and you've been resisting because it would cost
too much, maybe its time to reconsider. Numerous hotels near Anaheim's
granddaddy of theme parks offer family packages that can keep costs down. The
Harbor Inn Travelodge, for example, has a package for $229.88 that includes
two nights' lodging for a family of four, four one-day admissions to
Disneyland, shuttles between hotel and park and continental breakfast.
Additional hotel nights are $59.94. The same package at Raffles Inn costs
$252.08; extra nights are $71.04. Information: (800) 233-6583.;    Travel
agents should be able to provide information on other packages that include
hotel accommodations and admission to Disneyland or other Los Angeles-area
attractions.  </TEXT>
