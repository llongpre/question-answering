   Powerful thunderstorms whipped across Texas and Louisiana on
Saturday and scattered showers dampened the Plains and Rockies.
Snow fell on both Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks.
   A tornado was reported near Knox City, Texas, and a tornado
watch was posted for a large part of central Texas, including the
Dallas-Fort Worth area. The severe thunderstorms that pummeled
central Texas were the result of daytime heat meeting cold weather
aloft.
   Thunderstorms also were scattered across the lower Mississippi
Valley, with an intense thunderstorm along the Louisiana coast late
in the morning.
   Widely scattered showers reached from the central Plains to the
northern and central Rockies. Snow fell at Yellowstone National
Park in northwest Wyoming and was forecast near the north rim of
Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona.
   Moderate to heavy snow closed the road leading to the east
entrance of Yosemite National Park in California.
   Scattered rain continued in the Northeast, prompting a flash
flood watch for most of Maine, where recent rains have totaled 6
inches in some areas.
   A low pressure system was blamed for cloudy, cool weather from
western Pennsylvania across Ohio, Indiana and southern Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 91 degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   The low in the nation Saturday morning was 17 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Record low temperatures for the date were recorded in a few
cities, including 34 degrees in Asheville, N.C., 41 in Augusta,
Ga., 38 in Greer, S.C., 60 in Hollywood, Fla., and 38 in Knoxville,
Tenn.
   The forecast for Sunday called for rain across New England, the
Appalachians, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes. Showers and
thunderstorms were expected from Florida across the Gulf Coast
states to the Tennessee and middle Mississippi valleys, and from
eastern Texas across the central Plains to the northern and central
Rockies. Widely scattered thunderstorms were forecast for the
intermountain region.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s over the
northern and central Rockies and the central Appalachians, and into
the 80s from coastal South Carolina to Florida and from Louisiana
across most of Texas to the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs were
expected in the 60s and 70s.
