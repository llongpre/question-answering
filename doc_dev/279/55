   Hundreds of tourists
packed their bags this morning and filed out of Yellowstone
National Park's Canyon area, forced from the cabin development by
flames from one of the park's 10 fires.
   Crews near Helena, Mont., aimed to contain a 37,000-acre blaze
by tonight; firefighters in Idaho tried to rein in a 750-acre fire
on the slopes of the nation's deepest gorge in Hells Canyon, and a
rash of wildfires broke out Tuesday in Oregon, including a small
blaze ignited by a plane crash that killed three.
   In Yellowstone, a finger of flame from a 91,700-acre fire in the
park's western section edged to within 2 miles of the Canyon area,
the largest development in the country's oldest national park.
   Park spokeswoman Robbie Blackwell said 306 tourists and as many
as 275 staff members spent Tuesday night in the development, which
also contains a visitors center, a general store and a campground.
   ``Nobody wanted to rattle beds and get people up. As the people
are getting up this morning they will start going through checkout
procedures, have breakfast this morning and then start leaving the
Canyon area,'' said the spokesman.
   The fire, one of 10 in the park involving some 350,000 acres,
was the only one to post major advances Tuesday despite winds
gusting to about 30 mph. Low temperatures aided some 4,000
firefighters and 1,200 soldiers battling flames.
   Several other areas in the park are closed, including its Grant
Village complex containing a campground, hotel, visitors center and
staff dormitories.
   Many of the guests who had reserved spaces at Canyon's 600
cabins were moved to other park lodgings Tuesday night, said Steve
Tedder of TW Services, Yellowstone's concessionaire.
   ``Everything has been very orderly,'' he said. ``This has almost
become business as usual, as we've lived with it (the fires) for
about seven weeks.''
   Reservations are off about 25 percent this summer, Tedder added,
almost certainly because of this year's fires, the worst in memory
in Yellowstone.
   In Idaho, 400 firefighters battled to keep a fire from moving
over a ridge and into area with 12 million board-feet of timber the
National Forest Service wants to sell.
   Firefighters at a 156,500-acre blaze in Yellowstone's
northeastern corner were aided Tuesday by about 600 soldiers from
Fort Lewis, Wash. Another 600 Fort Lewis soldiers were to help
clean up a 4,300-acre fire in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National
Forest and adjacent Grand Teton National Park.
   In Montana, winds Tuesday pushed a blaze away from the towns of
Cooke City and Silver Gate, officials said.
   In mountains southeast of Helena, nearly 3,000 firefighters
gained a foothold in a two-week battle to contain the 37,600-acre
fire that destroyed more than a dozen structures.
   ``There are no problems on the line that we've heard of, and
we're still hoping for containment by 8 p.m.,'' said Gordon Gray, a
fire information officer.
   In the west-central Oregon town of LaPine, three families were
briefly evacuated Tuesday night because of one of a series of small
fires in the state. Lightning was blamed for at least 50 of the
blazes.
   Near Morton, Wash., gusty wind and 100-degree temperatures
allowed a forest fire to grow from 60 acres to 500 within a few
hours Tuesday, officials said. The blaze burned mostly on land
owned by the Murray Pacific Co., a timber firm.
