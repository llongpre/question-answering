   Lightning fires have
burned more than 200,000 acres of California forest in the past
week, and experts said Sunday it could get get ``much, much worse''
because of the lengthy drought.
   In Yosemite National Park, off limits to tourists since Friday,
two fires had burned more than 15,000 acres. Flames were within two
miles of the Merced Grove, a stand of giant sequoias, and within
two miles of the Badger Pass ski area.
   Across the state, 14 fires were listed as major.
   Fires also burned Sunday in parts of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Utah
and Washington state, said the Boise Interagency Fire Center in
Idaho; a fire in south-central Montana was controlled late
Saturday. The national firefighting command center said nearly
20,000 firefighters were at work on fires that had covered 856,000
acres, more than half of that acreage in Alaska.
   About 2,800 Army soldiers have begun firefighting training at
bases in Washington state and Colorado. About 100 soldiers left
Fort Lewis, Wash., on Sunday to relieve fatigued firefighters in
Oregon. About 1,100 more were to follow Monday, said Maj. John
Lundberg, a base spokesman.
   California's worst fire was in Tehama County about 200 miles
north of Yosemite, where two fires not far apart had burned a total
of 124,000 acres. In the Sequoia National Forest, southeast of
Yosemite and northeast of Bakersfield, a fire had burned over
24,000 acres and firefighters worked to protect the communities of
Kernville and Alta Sierra.
   ``The 200,000-acre figure for the state is probably pretty
conservative,'' said Karen Terrill of the California Department of
Forestry. ``What I hear the experts saying is that this could get
to be much, much worse.''
   The largest Tehama County fire, called the Campbell Complex,
covered 112,000 acres.
   ``It's probably going to become twice that,'' Chris Parker of
the CDF said. ``What we're seeing is the culmination of four years'
drought.''
   The Campbell fire was considered only 40 percent contained. The
Finley Lake fire six miles away was burning uncontrolled over
12,000 acres and was expected to join the bigger one, Terrill said.
State Highway 36 in the fire area, east of Red Bluff, was closed
Sunday.
   ``The Campbell is the most difficult to fight, is eating up the
most acreage, and is in an area that hasn't burned for about 50
years,'' she added. ``The Finley Lake fire is incredibly smoky.''
   The Finley Lake fire by Sunday had destroyed 13 trailer homes,
two houses and 27 outbuildings. A total of 127 structures have been
consumed by fires since Aug. 3 across the state, including 66 of
the 84 houses in the town of Foresta, at Yosemite.
   People allowed back into Foresta on Sunday saw the black trunks
of trees rising out of smoldering white ash.
   A firefighter surveying the ruins drove a stake three feet into
the earth, then pulled it out. The end was burned from ground
temperatures of 300 degrees.
   ``To save this town, it would have taken a massive sprinker
system,'' said Len McKenzie, chief naturalist at Yosemite.
   Yosemite firefighters took special precautions to protect the
sequoia trees, some of them 2,000 years old, in Merced Grove. This
included cleaning up forest debris in the area and treating the
trees with a fire retardant.
   But the thick-barked sequoias have lived through other fires,
Terrill noted, and probably could make it easily through another.
   Elsewhere in Yosemite, ``there's a degree of peacefulness, if
you are not caught up in the frantic business of firefighting,''
said Jeff Nicholas, 39, curator of Yosemite's Ansel Adams photo
gallery.
   ``This is the way it should be, quite and peaceful, without the
sound of tour buses,'' he said. The park normally has up to 25,000
tourists visiting on summer weekends.
   The Yosemite fires were about 10 miles west of Yosemite Valley,
the heavily visited site of Half Dome, El Capitan and Bridalveil
Falls.
   In 1987, summer fires in California burned more than 750,000
acres.
   ``Last week, we were saying this would be nothing like 1987.
There was very little humidity then,'' Terrill said Sunday. ``But
it also wasn't the fourth year of drought in the state then.''
   Lightning strikes _ almost 24,000 were counted by detection
equipment from Aug. 3 through the weekend _ were believed to have
caused all of the California fires.
   Elsewhere, firefighters appeared to be winning the battle Sunday
against five major groups of lightning-caused fires that have
burned across 119,420 acres of remote eastern Oregon forest and
range land.
   The town of Burns, Ore., was about four miles from the Pine
Springs Basin Complex of fires that had burned 73,700 acres. The
blaze was 75 percent contained Sunday morning and full containment
was expected by Monday evening.
   Firefighters took advantage of a break in the hot, dry weather
and contained Idaho's larger range fires, including the 65,000-acre
Thorn Creek blaze that damaged several outbuildings.
