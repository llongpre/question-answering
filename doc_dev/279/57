   Musicians Carole King and John Oates joined
environmentalists Wednesday in search of a congressman who will
sponsor a bill to outlaw logging and mining on 13 million
wilderness acres in five Northwest states.
   The rock stars, appearing on behalf of the Alliance for the Wild
Rockies, said taxpayer money is being used to drill, build roads
and clearcut trees on U.S. national forests.
   ``If we stopped spending federal money to destroy our public
lands maybe we wouldn't have to raise the taxes that President Bush
talked about this morning,'' said King, a Grammy-award winning
songwriter and singer.
   The environmental group based in Missoula, Mont., wants to ban
logging, mining and road-building on public lands stretching
through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington.
   Its proposed legislation also would protect 917 miles of
potential wild and scenic rivers and launch studies on nearly 2
million acres of national park candidates.
   Representatives of the organization met with a half dozen
lawmakers on Tuesday and scheduled meetings again Wednesday.
   ``Some environmental groups are like the unpopular kids at a
high school dance who stand around in the corner because no one
wants to dance with them,'' said Oates, of the band Hall &amp; Oates.
   ``I'm here to see if I can't get someone to dance with them,''
he said during a news conference in front of the Capitol.
   Executive Director Mike Bader, a former ranger at Yellowstone
National Park and a specialist on the grizzly bear, said there were
no formal sponsors so far, but he was optimistic there soon would
be one.
   Bader said King, Oates and Grateful Dead band member Bob Weir
have asked what they can to do to help further the group's cause.
   ``These celebrities are real people. They have real concerns.
They have seen the destruction that has happened on our public
lands and they want to do their part to help,'' he said.
   Oates and Weir joined actor Bill Curry on a bicycle ride through
Montana this summer to view the effects of clearcutting on the
region's forests.
   ``A few months ago, I didn't know the difference between a
national forest and a national park,'' Oates said. Logging is
allowed on national forests, but not on national parks.
   Curry said he got involved in the issue when he moved from New
York City to Montana's Bitterroot Valley about 18 months ago.
   ``I bought lands near a national park and they clearcut 300
acres behind my house. When I learned that I paid for that in
taxes, I was outraged,'' he said.
   King said efforts to defeat environmental legislation are based
on concern about the impact on jobs. But she said the group's
proposal would create new jobs for restoring the health of the
land.
