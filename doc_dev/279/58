   When Steve Falacy saw
open flames near the Virginia Cascade in fire-ravaged Yellowstone
National Park recently, he stopped his truck, ran into the
blackened woods with a shovel and attacked the hot spots.
   ``I'm from Montana and I won't let it burn anymore,'' said
Falacy, who grew up in Missoula and lives in Albuquerque, N.M.
   He shouldn't have done it, because he had no firefighting gear
or protective clothing and because snags are dangerous, but his
wife, Becky, said she couldn't stop him.
   ``He's really upset,'' she said.
   The Falacys were in Yellowstone to check out the damage from the
worst forest fires in centuries. Nearly half the park's 2.2 million
acres have been charred by wildfires this summer.
   ``It was about what I expected, but Steve just couldn't take it
when he saw the flames,'' Becky Falacy said. ``He saw flames and
went right down there. You couldn't stop him.''
   Falacy's typified the reactions of people from the Yellowstone
neighborhood _ the states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.
   ``I didn't realize how much damage there is until we saw it for
ourselves,'' said Bonnie Townsend, of Bozeman, Mont. ``It was bad
enough reading about it. This is so awful I can't describe it.''
   Living near the nation's oldest national park generates a
proprietary interest in its welfare, and there is much anger over
the events of the summer.
   However, tourists from distant parts of the United States and
overseas are less emotional about the damage and say they expected
to see far worse.
   ``When it all grows back it will be twice as pretty,'' said Jack
Quiggle, of Huntington Beach, Calif.
   Quiggle said television coverage of the fires had led him to
believe that ``all I'd see was burned trees. They made it sound
like the whole park was scorched to the ground.''
   Forest fires burn in a scattered pattern called a mosaic by
foresters. Acres of blackened trees are interspersed with untouched
stands. Other sections are burned at ground level, but foliage is
untouched.
   Many of the park's most popular attractions have escaped the
fires. No damage is visible at the falls near Canyon, Artist Point
and the north shore of Yellowstone Lake. Old Faithful, however, is
partially surrounded by scorched trees.
   A tour group from Australia marveled at the parts of the park
that remain _ at least so far _ undamaged.
   ``We thought it might be worse,'' said Val Ellerington of
Cokedale, New South Wales. ``But it's a beautiful place.
   ``We've been able to see the falls and Old Faithful and what we
wanted to see, and we're so glad we could see Yellowstone at all,''
she said.
   Milton and Marie Wright of Nashville, Tenn., said they, too,
expected more damage.
   Gazing out over the spectacular canyon and the falls of the
Yellowstone River, Marie Wright said she hated to see the burned
trees visible from some roads, but wasn't disappointed with the
park.
   ``The main reason to come to the park is the things like Old
Faithful, the canyon, animals and geysers, and all these things are
here,'' she said. ``There's a lot left.''
