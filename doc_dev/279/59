THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

The appointment of a career National Park Service official as superintendent of 
Yosemite National Park has, happily, squelched for now fears that politics 
would be injected into the selection of administrators of the nation's two 
oldest and most-revered national parks, Yosemite and Yellowstone. But that does 
not mean the job facing 42-year-old Michael V. Finley will not require a leader 
with a keen political sense. All of the divergent forces that come to bear on 
the operation of the national parks converge on Yosemite, where years of study 
and planning have failed to reconcile conflicts that sometimes seem to be 
irreconcilable. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone in the National Park Service is up to the job, it should be Finley. 
He has gotten rave reviews during his three years as superintendent of 
Everglades National Park, which is considered the most threatened in the park 
system. "He seems to thrive on tough jobs. He's a real pro," said Paul C. 
Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation Assn. Finley may be 
just the sort of person who is capable of developing creative methods of 
handling the problems of Yosemite, particularly the tremendous visitor 
pressures on Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Should that be the case, it will be because Finley has come up through the 
ranks of the Park Service and is intimately familiar with the conflicts 
involved in trying to achieve the park system's congressional mandate: to 
preserve the natural features of the parks while also making them available for 
the people's enjoyment. He knows how to deal with the concessionaires who run 
the hotels and other money-making ventures in the parks, with the 
environmentalists, and with the Park Service bureaucracy. And while he has had 
a short career with the agency, he also knows the importance of tradition and 
morale among the ranger corps. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent at Yosemite might not know those things if he or she 
instead had been drawn from the senior executive service, a federal management 
super-corps that consists of both career federal officers and political 
appointees. Such a proposal has been kicking around the past few years in the 
Department of the Interior, the Park Service's parent agency. The idea surfaced 
at about the same time the department's top-level political appointees began 
meddling in personnel affairs of the Park Service in violation of traditional 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite and Yellowstone apparently were singled out because they are such 
visible natural catalysts for political controversy. An example was the intense 
criticism unjustly heaped on Yellowstone Supt. Robert Barbee during the 1988 
fire season. If the Yellowstone and Yosemite appointees came from outside the 
Park Service and did not plan full careers in the parks, they might be more 
subject to political manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. apparently has decided this was a bad idea 
and has dropped it. Good. There should be no further thought given to political 
tinkering with the parks. Superintendents must have the freedom to offend 
powerful political groups and economic interests, if necessary, in fulfilling 
their responsibility to protect the natural integrity of the park lands. Only 
if that independence is maintained will the nation's park system have the 
benefit of talented people like Michael Finley.
