<LEADPARA>  A SMALL group of snowshoers, ignoring lightly falling snow, trudged slowly
behind a ranger-naturalist through a dense grove of redwoods in Sequoia
National Park.;    The group of men, women and children stopped at the base of
a mammoth sequoia and the ranger began describing both the tree and the
surrounding terrain. While the hikers listened, they also stared in awe at the
monumental General Sherman Tree -- one of the planet's largest living things.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Such a free, guided snowshoe walk is just one of the many outdoor
activities available to winter visitors to four of California's national
parks.;    Summer crowds are gone;  Winter often is the best season for
visiting Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Lassen and Yosemite National Parks. The summer
crowds are gone, which means the lodges, visitor centers and roads are no
longer congested.;    Among the winter options in the state's snow-blessed
national parks are ice skating, snowcat touring, snowboarding, sledding,
cross-country touring and downhill skiing.;    As might be expected, Yosemite
offers the most varied program.;    For those who prefer to ride in a
motorized vehicle while sightseeing, Yosemite features an open-air snowcat
tour. All tours leave from Badger Pass, California's oldest downhill ski
area.;    Badger Pass has six lifts, nine runs, an 8,100-foot summit and a
900-foot vertical.;    Oldest cross-country center;  Yosemite also boasts the
Far West's oldest cross-country center. Before World War II, Yosemite excelled
in wilderness outings. These were focused on ski hut tours, mountaineering
treks, snow camping and back-country survival experiences.;    Yosemite
recently discovered the popularity of groomed trails. Free cross-country track
and skating lanes now are groomed on scenic Glacier Point Road from Badger
Pass to Glacier Point, a 21-mile round trip 3,200 feet above the valley
floor.;    Part of the Glacier Point Trail follows the valley's rim, with
commanding views of Half Dome, El Capitan and Cathedral Spires. Reservations
are required for visitors who ski to Glacier Point and then stay overnight in
a cozy hut -- with meals prepared by a guide.;    Altogether, Yosemite offers
350 miles of skiable trails and roads, with 90 miles beginning from the Badger
Pass Cross-Country Center.;    Each winter day at 11 a.m., a ranger-naturalist
leads an easy, 90-minute snowshoe walk to Clark Range Vista. That's a scenic
overlook with a spectacular view of the high Sierra.;    Although it closes
for the season this weekend, one of the nation's biggest outdoor ice skating
rinks is situated on the valley floor with an incredible view of Half Dome,
the park's most distinctive landmark.;    Far to the north is Lassen National
Park, situated on State Route 89 about 50 miles east of Red Bluff. Just a mile
inside Lassen's southwest entrance is a busy activities center for snowshoe
walks and cross-country touring. Because of the lack of snow earlier in the
season, the downhill area at Lassen decided to stay closed, even though snow
since has fallen in abundance.;    "Free ranger-guided snowshoe tours to a
giant thermal area called the Sulfur Works are offered at 1:30 p.m. each
Saturday, Sunday and holiday. The distance is about one mile in each direction
and the three-hour tours are open to all ages, with free snowshoes available,"
reports John Koeberer. He's owner of the Lassen Park Ski Area.;    A popular
seven-mile cross-country trail to Lake Helen also begins near the front door
of Lassen's Chalet Building.;    Koeberer explains, "Lassen has no groomed
cross-country trails. Most nordic skiers head out on the park road, which is
closed to vehicle traffic at the ski area during the winter months.";   
Hidden away on the western slope of the southern Sierra are Kings Canyon and
Sequoia national parks. Joined end to end, they extend 65 miles north to
south. Sequoia is the oldest of the state's national parks, founded five days
before Yosemite in 1890.;    Kings Canyon is situated east of Fresno on State
Highway 180 while Sequoia is northeast of Visalia via State Route 198. Ski
touring is the biggest activity in both parks.;    At Kings Canyon, two
concessionaires offer a variety of guided tours, lessons and rentals. Sequoia
Ski Touring in Grant Grove at 5,000-foot elevation has access to 75 miles of
back-country skiing. In nearby Wilsonia, Wilsonia Ski Touring offers 100 miles
of trails. That includes skiing to a wilderness hut with dormitory lodging.;  
 Thirty-five miles of ungroomed trails in Sequoia National Park -- ranging
from flat meadows for novices to strenuous terrain for experienced skinny
skiers -- start at Wolverton. That's also the site of a nordic center offering
rentals and lessons.;    Wolverton, with a base elevation of 7,000 feet, also
has a snowplay hill for sledding and tubing (bring your own gear) and a small
downhill ski area.;    "We offer ranger-led snowshoe walks every weekend and
on holidays in both parks," says Malinee Crapsey, a national park ranger.  </TEXT>
