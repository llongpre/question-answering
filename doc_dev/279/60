   A Yale history professor
with a passion for America's national parks told their
superintendents today they are stewards of the world's greatest
university.
   ``I take the national park service of any society as a series of
symbols about what a people chose to take pride in,'' Robin Winks
told 300 National Park Service managers on the second day of an
extraordinary, four-day conference.
   ``These are the testimonials, the building blocks that Americans
believe they have done historically. You begin to get into a heart
of a people by viewing what they have chosen to preserve,'' said
Winks, who has visited 315 of the 342 units of the National Park
system and is a frequent participant in park service training
sessions.
   ``Every superintendent in the National Park system is president
of a small university, keeping the flame of an historical event of
which we are proud,'' Winks said. ``You are stewards over what I
view as the single greatest university of the world.''
   On Wednesday, park managers at the first such conference in 12
years said America's national parks are in better condition than
ever.
   Superintendent Bob Barbee, Park Service Director William Penn
Mott and others agreed that budget constraints have forced them to
find new solutions to old problems, such as deteriorating
maintenance and substandard housing.
   Environmental and citizens' groups have said threats to the
parks include logging, oil drilling, pollution and commercial and
residential development near parks.
   ``I get tired of all this `Chicken Little' stuff,'' Barbee told
reporters. ``We've made a lot of improvements.
   ``There is more control and management of the resources and some
people don't like that because they don't like control, but the
good side of that is ... we are more sensitive to the integrity of
the resources than we have ever been,'' said Barbee, whose park,
Yellowstone, was the world's first national park.
   ``I would contend that in Yellowstone (National Park),
biologically, today we are in better shape than we were 75 years
ago,'' he said.
   He noted that 75 years ago a dairy herd, slaughterhouses,
garbage dumps and other things needed to support staff and park
visitors produced tons of pollution.
   ``As late as 1970, 80,000 pounds of wet garbage _ pizza crusts
and slop _ was available to bears in open dumps. Now there are zero
pounds of wet garbage, the dumps are gone, it's all hauled long
distances out of the park,'' Barbee said.
   He said Yellowstone's physical plant is also in better shape
than it's ever been, even though an estimated $300 million is
needed to repair deteroriated facilities.
   At Grand Canyon National Park, wild burros were once a problem,
said Superintendent Dick Marks.
   ``Today there are no burros in the park, the Big Horn sheep are
making a comeback'' and conflicts between people on the ground and
those making canyon overflights ``are being worked out,'' Marks
said.
   During the far-ranging session with reporters, Mott denied
accusations by critics in environmental groups and Congress that he
may have held back his best professional advice because of
admininstrative opposition.
   ``No one, not even (Interior Department Secretary Donald) Hodel,
has personally throttled me on what I personally feel,'' said Mott.
   The administration's commitment to the parks system was one of
the issues discussed earlier in the day.
   William Horn, assistant secretary of the Interior for Fish,
Wildlife and Parks, said he was tired of ``a continuing drumbeat of
critics claiming the administration is anti-park and committers of
sins.''
   He pointed out that the administration has proposed a $734
million operating budget for the Park Service for the next fiscal
year, compared to $391 million in 1980.
   ``That constitutes the largest operating budget in the history
of the National Park Service and represents 29 percent
post-inflation, real growth over the past seven years,'' Horn said.
   Further, the Park Service employs 16,414 people, the highest
level in its 72-year history, Horn said.
   ``These numbers bespeak a commitment to a first-class national
park system,'' he said.
