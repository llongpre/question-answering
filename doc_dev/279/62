   The teen-agers listened spellbound as Rachelle
Horowitz recalled the sweltering day when Martin Luther King Jr.
stood just a few feet away down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
   For these budding historians, children of the me-decade '80s,
the civil rights movement had been an abstraction in a textbook.
   But the 17 students from high schools in 15 states and the
District of Columbia walked away from the memorial with a sense of
awe that they can convey to the millions of tourists who climb the
same steps each year.
   ``It's more exciting here than learning it in school,'' said
Barbara Burnette, a 19-year-old senior at Edison High School in
Minneapolis.
   ``With books, you're like, right, oh yeah. You've got to be
there to really get into it.''
   The students were selected to help the National Park Service
plan and raise money for a new museum inside the Lincoln Memorial
to honor the legacy of Lincoln, King and the nation's other leaders
in civil rights.
   ``I used to think Lincoln was just a great man who was tall and
wore a hat,'' said Maureen May, 17, of Copley, Ohio. ``But now I
want his ideals to come alive. I want everyone to know about his
legacy and to use it.''
   The students spent the past week in the Washington area talking
to park service planners, touring historic sites and listening to
people like Horowitz, who participated in the 1963 March on
Washington and other major demonstrations.
   Horowitz, then 23, was the transportation director for the March
on Washington.
   She pointed around the corner inside the memorial where U.S.
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a black student protest leader at the time,
hurriedly rewrote one of the opening speeches. She pointed down the
steps to the very spot where King stood and told the world, ``I
have a dream.''
   ``He silenced a quarter of a million people on a hot August
day,'' she told the students.
   Horowitz provided the students with the sights, sounds and the
sense of the throng spread out before King.
   The National Park Service has involved the students in planning
the Lincoln Memorial museum in a way that it has never used the
public before, said Jane Radford, a park service planner.
   ``This is not done in the museum business,'' she said. ``This
was particularly appropriate and very exciting because Lincoln's
legacy is often carried on by the youth of this country in protest
and demonstration.''
   The proposed museum capped a two-year effort begun by a
Scottsdale, Ariz., high school history class. The students were
upset that their state wouldn't honor King with a holiday.
   The students were picked by the American Federation of Teachers
and other organizations to represent a cross-section of ethnic
backgrounds. Their selection was based on a demonstrated interest
in Lincoln and good communication and leadership skills.
   Later they will coordinate a student drive to raise $300,000 for
the exhibit by collecting pennies.
   The students visited the park service's interpretative design
center in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., where they submitted their proposal
for an exhibit featuring interactive videos, continuous films,
computer quizzes, artifacts and recordings.
   The students came from high schools in Alabama, Arizona,
Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington.
