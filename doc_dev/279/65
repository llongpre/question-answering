   Smoke-filled air and
reduced access to parts of Yellowstone National Park because of
forest fires have reduced the numbers of tourists and prompted the
early closure of some of park lodgings.
   The 296-room Lake Hotel on the north shore of Yellowstone Lake
usually stays open through late September
   But just 76 of the recently renovated hotel's rooms were filled
Saturday night, and on Sunday visitors were told the hotel was
closing as of 11 a.m.
   Nearby Lake Lodge, with 180 rooms, will remain open for the time
being.
   With access to the Lake area restricted to only the east
entrance of the park, and the famous Old Faithful Geyser
inaccessible, except from the north and west entrances, it wasn't
profitable to keep the majestic victorian hotel open, said Steve
Tedder, vice president and general manager of TW Recreational
Services Inc., Yellowstone's concessionaire.
   ``Basically the overall situation is, with the current fire
condition, unpredictable road conditions, the smoke conditions,
business has declined significantly over the past week,'' he said.
   At nearby Fishing Bridge, just 16 of the 320 recreational
vehicle sites were filled, he said.
   Lake Hotel is the latest Yellowstone lodging facility closed in
recent weeks by forest fires that have charred roughly 400,000
acres of the country's first national park.
   Earlier this month, the Grant Village complex, which contains a
hotel, a campground and employee dormitories, was closed when the
Red and Shoshone fires approached from the west.
   Last week, the Canyon area was evacuated when flames from the
33,265-acre Wolf Lake fire burned to within one-half mile of the
complex, which now houses a firefighters' camp.
   While the flames have stayed away from the Lake area, the smoke
has not. Guests go to sleep at night smelling smoke and wake up in
the morning to the acrid stench.
   Flames can be seen from Canyon, and the road from Canyon to
Norris and south to Madison Junction is lined by acre after acre of
charred, smouldering trees. In some areas, burning trees can be
seen from the roads, and snags _ burned-out trees that have toppled
_ occasionally line road shoulders.
   Tourists determined to see Yellowstone despite the fires can
stop along the few roads that are open, to watch herds of elk and
bison grazing in unburned meadows or to see columns of smoke rising
thousands of feet into the sky.
   The tourist drought has not yet seriously affected the Old
Faithful area, which Tedder called ``one of the least smoky areas
of the park.''
   On Friday night 296 of the 320 rooms in the Old Faithful Inn
were filled, while Saturday night, 192 of the rooms were taken, he
said.
   However, getting from one side of the park to the other is
impossible at times, Tedder said.
   ``At this point, there is no access to the interior of the
park,'' he said.
   The drop in business has cost TW Services more than $1 million
in sales, although Tedder didn't have an estimate of the overall
drop including the reduction in lodging reservations.
   The company is negotiating with its insurance companies to see
if some of the losses can be recouped, he said, and talks also will
be held with the National Park Service to see if the
concessionaire's contract can be altered.
   Under that contract TW Services is required to pump 22 percent
of its gross sales back into Yellowstone in maintenance and
improvements.
   The company also has a 5 percent profit cap in its contract,
whereby any profits above 5 percent must be funneled back into the
facilities, said Tedder.
