   Environmentalists have won a preliminary round in
their fight to block construction of a second hotel on the
little-developed North Rim of the Grand Canyon.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Rosenblatt granted a preliminary
injunction Friday at the request of the Sierra Club Legal Defense
Fund, which claims the Park Service failed to conduct a proper
environmental impact study for the 200-room project.
   Sierra Club attorneys also argued the $5 million hotel would
detract from the experience of visiting the Grand Canyon.
   Park Service officials have said an environmental assessment they
performed was sufficient because the hotel site is located at an
already developed area, near the existing 200-room lodge, the only
lodging on the North Rim.
   The Park Service contended that it complied with legal
requirements and that the new hotel is needed because current
lodging doesn't meet demand.
   The preliminary injunction will allow construction of employee
housing by TW Recreational Services, the company contracted to build
the hotel.
   ``We're extremely pleased,'' said Fern Shepard, a lawyer for the
Sierra Club. ``We think that this is really an important decision
for the Grand Canyon.''
   ``We hope the Park Service will now go back and prepare an
environmental impact study and look to see if this project was
really even necessary in the first place,'' she said.
   ``I'm very dissapointed,'' said Gene Cohen, the attorney
representing TW Services, adding that the judge ``doesn't address
the arguements that we made.''
   ``He was concerned in the opinion that the 1984 contract was
executed before the environmental assesment was done. That seems to
have troubled the judge,'' Cohen said. ``As we understand it, there
is nothing wrong with that.''
   Jack Davis, superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park, said
Park Service officials would meet this week to decide whether to
appeal or go to trial on the Sierra Club suit.
   Cohen said the delay has already cost TW Services valuable time
because the North Rim, more than 7,000 feet above sea level, allows
only a brief summer building season and the hotel will take two
seasons to construct.
