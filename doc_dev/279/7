The three national parks in Central California are already filling for the 
Labor Day holiday, the last long weekend of the summer. Officials in Yosemite, 
Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said they expect all three to be filled 
by midday today. "Anyone without reservations for a camping spot, tent, cabin 
or hotel room will have to leave the park at night," said Lisa Dapprich, a 
National Park Service spokeswoman in Yosemite. "We still have a few campsites 
on a first-come, first-served basis, but they'll be gone by Friday morning." 
Officials in Sequoia and Kings Canyon reported similar conditions and said they 
expect the parks to be heavily used by holiday crowds during the three-day 
weekend.
