   Firefighters battling blazes that charred
nearly 6,000 acres of brush said they were confident the flames
would not burn a shelter for exotic animals or burn the area around
giant trees in Sequoia National Park.
   Barring sudden gusts, the 3,300-acre fire northwest of Los
Angeles did not present a threat to the Wildlife Way Station or a
home for 125 emotionally disturbed children, said U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman Kim Vanderhaar.
   The flames were 1{ miles away from the animal shelter and about
3 miles beyond the home for children in Little Tujunga Canyon, she
said.
   Officials at the wild animal shelter were cautious but confident.
   ``All the animals are confined, because we can't guard a
free-roaming animal very well,'' said Martine Colette, spokeswoman
for the animal shelter about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles.
   The shelter houses alligators, tigers, bears, horses, giraffes
and a variety of other abandoned exotic pets and wild animals that
wandered into neighborhoods.
   The fire in the Angeles National Forest, which was 30 percent
contained as of early today, forced evacuations of seven homes.
   Two firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the
blaze, which officials estimated will be surrounded at 6 p.m.
Wednesday and extinguished 24 hours later.
   More than 800 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and
three helicopters that began dropping water and fire-retardant
chemicals at dawn Monday as the blaze burned dry brush in
inaccessible mountainous terrain.
   Three Los Angeles men were booked on $2,500 bail for
investigation of starting a forest fire with an illegal campfire,
but they were released Monday and no charges were to be filed, said
Deputy Hal Grant of the Sheriff's Information Bureau.
   ``It appears a 10-year-old boy has admitted to it,'' Grant said.
``He told arson investigators he started a campfire that got out of
control.''
   The fire was one of several _ including a 1,500-acre fire near
trees up to 2,700 years old in Sequoia National Park _ that erupted
during the weekend as an autumn heat wave blasted California with
temperatures near 100 degrees in some areas and sent dry desert
winds gusting to 30 mph.
   In Sequoia, 600 firefighters worked to make sure the fires kept
away from the 3-square-mile Giant Forest, a grove of trees
considered the largest living things on Earth, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Michele Case. The fire was burning away from the trees
as of today, she said.
   The trees can generally survive forest fires because their soft
bark can withstand considerable heat and flame, although ``a
sequoia tree is fire-resistant, not fireproof,'' Case said.
   Elsewhere in California, other blazes consumed about 1,300 acres
of brush.
