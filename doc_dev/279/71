   Hundreds of firefighters Saturday battled forest fires in
Colorado, California and Utah that consumed nearly 10,000 acres.
Officials were concerned about the potential for further blazes as
thousands headed for parks for the Fourth of July weekend.
   More than 250 firefighters worked to contain four
lightning-sparked blazes that had charred about 1,250 acres in
bone-dry western and northern Colorado by Saturday. One building was
burned and people evacuated from more than half a dozen homes
southwest of Grand Junction when the newest forest fire erupted.
   In California, a new fire burned near the Sequoia National Forest
as experts began restoring 8,200 scorched acres south of Los Angeles.
   In Utah, a 200-acre fire in the Ashley National Forest's Rough
Canyon, 23 miles west of Duchesne, had been contained on Thursday
but burst into flames again Friday when 20 to 25 mph winds from the
southwest pushed the burning embers into fresh vegetation. Northwest
of Rough Canyon, a blaze dubbed the Three-Mile Fire had blackened
300 acres. Eighty firefighters, ferried to the remote site by two
helicopters, were on the lines.
   In Colorado, BLM spokesman Doug Huntington said the newest fire,
a 300-acre blaze in the Glade Park area about 15 miles southwest of
Grand Junction, was being battled with crews operating half a dozen
fire engines, three air tankers and helicopters.
   ``Numerous other structures, homes and barns, are threatened,''
he said.
   He said the fire was noticed about noon, and within four hours
had grown to 300 acres.
   Mesa County Sheriff's Capt. Bob Silva said all the residents of
the satellite community near Grand Junction had been contacted and
asked to evacuate. He did not know how many evacuees there were.
   The most damaging fire in Colorado consumed about 800 acres, but
was about 70 percent contained in a small canyon about 10 miles
north of Grand Junction, said U.S. Bureau of Land Management
spokeswoman Keele Keeler.
   A 275-acre blaze in the Poudre Canyon northwest of Fort Collins
was about 30 percent contained, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jeff
Chandler said.
   Chandler said the fire threatened some structures near Rustic,
but no property damage was reported.
   Firefighters believe they have the upper hand on a 175-acre blaze
along a mountain ridge north of Dinosaur that began Wednesday, said
BLM spokesman Jim Anderson.
   Authorities posted a high to extreme fire danger advisory
statewide, and urged outdoor recreationists to use caution during
the holiday weekend.
   Officials also warned against celebrating the Fourth with
fireworks.
   In California, more than 600 firefighters were on the line
against a 227-acre fire south of the Sequoia National Forest, said
state Department of Forestry spokeswoman Donna Atwood.
   ``It's in real steep, brushy terrain ... but there are no reports
of high winds, which is helpful,'' Atwood said. Along with the
firefighters, two aerial tankers and two water-dropping helicopters
worked to douse the flames.
   The national forest and its preserve of giant trees were not in
danger from the fire.
   No homes or other buildings were damaged or threatened, and there
were no reports of injuries, Atwood said. The fire was about 150
miles north of Los Angeles.
   Firefighters planned to contain the Lake Elsinore fire, which
burned 11 homes, and left more than 8,200 acres scorched, including
1,000 acres of the Cleveland National Forest.
   Nearly 2,300 firefighters were on the line earlier this week at
the height of the blaze 65 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
