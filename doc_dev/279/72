<LEADPARA>  A CALIFORNIA company is proposing what may be the ultimate wilderness
experience for those who think that "roughing it" means looking at mountains
and canyons through the windshield of a car.;     Tourists can come to remote
towns such as this, on the edge of the great American national parks, view a
magnificent film about the park on a giant wrap-around movie screen, stay
overnight in an adjoining motel and then leave without having to set foot in
-- or damage -- the park itself.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although it is hard to say exactly how many people might do this, the
company -- World Odyssey of Los Altos -- is planning to build such a project
here amid the deep canyons and steep red sandstone cliffs and spires of Zion
National Park and at many other parks and monuments around the country.;    
"It is conceivable that whole busloads can come to Springdale, have the Zion
experience and be in Las Vegas that night -- it blows my mind," said Louise
Excell, a native of this Southwest Utah hamlet through which more than 1.5
million visitors pass every year to enter the Zion National Park.;     "They
won't have to sweat or get their heart rate above armchair level," she added.
"There's a market for this. It may be possible again some day to bicycle up
Zion Canyon without being run off the road by a tour bus.";     Excell is a
leader of a local faction opposing the project, not because of the movie
theater concept but rather because of its proposed location on an 11.2-acre
meadow in front of the main park entrance.;     Critics say the planned
theater, motel and retail complex would be too imposing and should be placed
closer to the center of this tiny town so that campers and visitors inside the
park are not directly confronted by them.;     World Odyssey is owned by Keith
Merrill, a film maker, who won an Academy Award for best documentary feature
in 1974 for "The Great American Cowboy," which he produced and directed, and
David Mariani, a real estate developer.;     They are adapting a film
technology known as Imax, which uses a screen 50 feet high and 70 feet wide to
give viewers the feeling of almost being in the scene. It is familiar to
millions who have seen the film "To Fly" at the Smithsonian Institution.;    
It will be a startling addition to tiny Springdale, which has no parking
meters, telephones with four-digit local dialing and not a single movie house
in town.;     The idea, Merrill said, is to "extend and expand" the park
experience with a technology that can "suspend the audience in place and time
and take them back through history.";     Although environmentalists do not
know whether to applaud or complain about the concept, Merrill argued that it
offered benefits both to visitors and to the fragile parks.;     "About 80
percent of the visitors at national parks have no opportunity to run the
rivers or hike the canyons or camp in a wilderness area," he said, adding that
many are too old or handicapped.;     "And part of our motive is to alleviate
pressure on the parks themselves by creating an experience that precludes an
undue number of people from trampling all over the wildflowers.";     World
Odyssey has built similar projects near the rugged Grand Canyon National Park,
near the Alamo and near Niagara Falls. The Grand Canyon theater attracts
600,000 visitors a year at $6 each.;     "These projects play a really
positive role to aid the national park in its charter, which is to provide an
interpretive experience for visitors, which is usually just a little video in
the bookstore," Merrill said.;     The company has plans for theaters near
Yellowstone and Great Smokey Mountains national parks. These projects have
stirred no particular disputes.;     But the plans here for a 350-seat
theater, 80 motel rooms and 275 parking places has been a different story.
Nearly everybody in this chronically depressed region, where tourism is the
main industry, welcomes the project and the jobs and income it will bring. But
not so its location, backing directly on the park's Watchman campground and
abutting the entrance station.;     "Our concern is the location, the visual
impact," said Larry Wiese, assistant superintendent of the park. "The
aesthetics at the entrance of the park would be changed dramatically. The size
of the project just overwhelms that site.";     The issue has forced tiny
Springdale, with a population of 300 and complex politics that belies its
size, to come to grips with the kind of development it wants.;     Skeptics
such as Excell fear that Sprindale will start to acquire the garishness of
Gatlinburg, Tenn., outside the Great Smokey park, and West Yellowstone, Mont.;
    World Odyssey has disarmed much opposition by agreeing with its critics
and redesigning the project so it is less visible from an adjoining highway.; 
   "While the screen is very, very large, we essentially bury the buildings to
keep a low profile," Merrill said. "It's not nearly as obtrusive as
environmentalists would like to suggest."  </TEXT>
