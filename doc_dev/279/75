<TEXT>     Park officials have signed a contract with a private film maker to create a
jaw-dropping, high-tech film to feature in a new 200-seat movie theater in
Yosemite Valley. The film could generate as much as $1 million annually for
Yosemite, the film makers say.;    But reaction has not been all positive
since the Park Service began circulating copies of the initial script this
month.;    "This is fine for Steven Spielberg. It's not fine for Yosemite,"
said Alfred Runte, a parks historian who was asked by the film maker to
comment on the script.;    "This will just, for all the wrong reasons,
increase visitation," said Lee Stetson, who has portrayed Yosemite explorer
John Muir in a live theatrical performance that has played in Yosemite for
nine years.;    Leonard McKenzie, Yosemite's chief park interpreter and a
proponent of the film, admits "not everyone agrees with me on this proposal.
Almost everything that's done in Yosemite sparks some disagreement.";   
Nonetheless, the Park Service signed a pact with Southern California-based
Multi Image Corp., which has a year to generate an estimated $4 million in
corporate sponsorships needed for the project.;    About $1 million is needed
to build the movie theater in an existing auditorium just behind the valley's
visitors center. The other $3 million would fund the film. In return, the Park
Service has agreed to lift its ban of low-flying aircraft over Yosemite for
the film makers.;    A helicopter equipped with a special 70-millimeter camera
would shoot the sweeping, swooping footage of the valley, surrounding peaks
and high country.;    Supplying the cameras is Iwerks Entertainment, whose
large-format film technology is similar to the big-screen movies that show
outside the Grand Canyon and in the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum. But in
Yosemite, the screen will be no larger than the existing auditorium wall.;   
"A plunge of 3,000 feet from Glacier Point to the valley floor has the
audience holding on to their seats," reads the script from writer Jay Groen. A
narrator then guides the viewer on an aerial journey throughout the park and
back into Yosemite history.;    Among the scenes: Explorer John Muir, jawing
with President Theodore Roosevelt during their 1903 Yosemite back-country
hike. And legendary hunter James Capen "Grizzly" Adams, shooting a grizzly
bear, his muzzle still smoking as he walks out from the bushes.;    "There are
some very strong themes, the preservation theme, conservation, the fact that
the federal government is necessary," Groen said of his script. "We've used no
creative license in terms of history. The history is entertainment enough.";  
 In return for producing the film at no cost to the Park Service, the private
backers want the rights to show it outside the park, Groen said.;    A
proposal to build a four-story movie theater just outside Zion National Park
in Utah, in order to feature a film about Zion, has stirred outrage from both
outside and inside the Park Service. But in Yosemite, the government's
attitude is lights, cameras, action.;    "It will have some theatrical
qualities, there's no doubt about it," McKenzie said. "It will also have some
strong interpretive values. If it didn't, we wouldn't be participating in
it.";    The Park Service has yet to decide what price, if any, a ticket to
the movie would cost.;    But Runte, the Yosemite political historian, said he
fears the introduction of the silver screen to the valley.;    "What I see
happening is that everybody will come into the park to see the film that makes
their stomach turn," said Runte, "instead of stepping outside to hear what a
ranger has to say."  </TEXT>
