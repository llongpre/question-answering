A LESS-GRAND OPTION NEXT DOOR

If you've got a hankering to live at the Galleria, but don't care to disclose 
your financial status, there is a less-grand option. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Lodge motel, next door to the Grand, rents rooms furnished with 
king-size beds for as little as $32.95 per night. Instead of a marble lobby, 
you'll have to settle for inexpensive mobile home-style paneling and a faux 
brick motif. But your king-size bed may feature a fancy red Naugahyde headboard 
and your walls come complete with framed posters of Yosemite, the Grand Canyon 
and other scenic wonders.

A household of two requiring only one bed will pay $34.95 per night (about 
$1,083 a month before tax) plus a $3 key deposit and a $20 phone deposit (both 
refundable). Your monthly total comes to $1,061.45 before tax -- slightly more 
than for a one-bedroom place next door at the Grand -- and you don't get a 
kitchen. But utilities and color TV are thrown in free, you don't have to show 
that you make more than $3,000 a month and, best of all, you can pay your rent 
with a credit card. PAT DOUGHERTY
