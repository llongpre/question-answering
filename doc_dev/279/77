   About once a week, Milan Tait dons his "Save Acadia" T-shirt and drives past the new kiosk at Maine's Acadia National Park without paying the $5 entrance fee. 
Until this year admission was free, and Mr. Tait is protesting the charge. 

   "I was hoping they'd arrest me," says the Bucksport, Maine, janitor, who refuses to pay more than a $5 "donation" that he made in May. 
But so far, he says, the rangers just watch. 

   Visitors to many of the 337 national parks this year will face new or higher entrance fees. 
The Interior Department's Park Service has begun charging such fees at 71 parks and doubled or tripled charges at 62 parks that already had them. 
The fees, which range from $1 to $5 a week for each person or vehicle, are generating revenue -- and controversy. 

   Most Park Service officials say the entrance charges are reasonable. 
Benjamin Clary, assistant superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, where fees have risen to $5 a vehicle from $2 last year, says: "When you think of what it costs to go to a Disneyland, or whatever, it's not very much." (Disneyland's daily admission: $20 per adult, $15 for children ages 3 to 11.) 

   But like Mr. Tait, some people object on principle. 
"It is unfair to force taxpayers who have paid for these parks with their hard-earned tax dollars to accept a fee to enter them," says Democratic Rep. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii. 
Congress, which has approved many of the Park Service's changes, is moving to block charges at some sites and has stipulated that any added fee revenue be spent on the parks. 

   One of the sharpest criticisms came from within the Park Service itself. 
Hobart Cawood, superintendent at Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park, denounced plans to charge a $2 entrance fee there, especially during this year's Constitution bicentennial. 
"I felt this was a part of the system that was above money," he says. 
After a House committee voted to bar the fee there, the Interior Department dropped the idea, at least for this year. 

   Heartened, Sen. Bill Bradley attacked a planned $1 fee at the Statue of Liberty. 
Quoting her inscription, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," the New Jersey Democrat added, "She does not say, 'And give me a dollar.'" 
The Senate voted an exemption, which the House yesterday approved and prepared to send to the president. 

   Now South Dakota officials are battling to preserve a 58-year-old statutory ban on visitor fees at Mount Rushmore. 
A recent House bill would abolish the ban, but Republican Sen. Larry Pressler argues that Mount Rushmore "is not a recreational service for which fees should be charged. 
It is a patriotic experience, an education in American history, a lesson in art and an inspiration to all who visit there." 

   But further fee increases may be afoot. 
The Reagan administration wants to raise charges at 12 "crown jewel" parks -- including Yellowstone, Grand Teton and Grand Canyon parks -- to $5 a person or $10 a vehicle for a week. 
It is seeking increases at about eight other sites. 
And it wants new fees at 22 more parks. 

   The House bill would block many of these changes. 
It would exempt from fees 26 urban sites, including the Washington Monument. 
It would freeze charges for most parks at current levels, though it would allow the rises sought for Yellowstone, Grand Teton and Grand Canyon parks. 
Generally it would also let the Park Service charge $15 for an annual pass to one park and $25 for a pass to all of them. 
More support for the increases is expected in the Senate, which plans to consider the issue in committee soon. 

   A Park Service spokesman says the current fee structure will produce $40 million in revenue this year, up from $10 million last year. 
The additional changes would raise the total as high as $60 million next year. 
But the funds won't help trim the budget deficit -- even though, by most accounts, White House officials proposed the changes for that very purpose. 
Congress has ordered instead that the new fee revenue be added to existing spending levels on the parks. 

   One result will be more attractions for visitors. 
At Yellowstone, the added money is paying to hire more staff to conduct trail walks, explain geysers and run visitor centers. 
Acadia Park is repairing buildings, studying environmental problems and improving horse and carriage trails. 
Cabrillo National Monument, near San Diego, is giving more lecture tours of tidal pools teeming with octopuses, abalone, crabs, sea hares and other wildlife. 

   William Mott, the Park Service's director, says the fees also yield indirect benefits. 
Litter has diminished, trimming the service's $15 million annual pickup bill. 
"I guess psychologically," Mr. Mott says, "when (visitors) pay, they feel they have some responsibility for the park."
