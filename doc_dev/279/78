   Here is a brief outline of forest fires in the Western states:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WYOMING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight forest fires are burning in Yellowstone National Park and
four in the surrounding national forests in northwestern Wyoming.
   Flames from the 90,000-acre North Fork fire at Yellowstone moved
to within a quarter-mile Tuesday of the Canyon hotel and campground
complex. A military helicopter dropped foam on the Canyon visitors
center and other buildings.
   The fires have charred about 450,000 acres of the 2.2
million-acre park. Officials said they have spent $54.4 million
fighting them and about 8,400 firefighters, including hundreds of
soldiers, are at work.
   The largest fire outside Yellowstone, the Mink Creek fire,
covers 108,000 acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest.

<HEAD>MONTANA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight major fires had burned about 188,000 acres of Montana
forests by Tuesday. Four were in designated wilderness areas,
including one that has spread into Yellowstone National Park.
Ranchers near the growing, 46,000-acre Scapegoat Wilderness blaze,
the state's largest, were warned they may have to evacuate today.

   More than 2,500 firefighters and dozens of National Guardsmen
were fighting 17 major fires over 70,000 acres.
   Crews were expected to use bulldozers to dig fire lines today
around ranches in the Caribou National Forest threatened by the
7,000-acre Trail Creek blaze. Crews also were protecting summer
homes from the 17,000-acre Battle Axe wilderness fire northeast of
Challis and a communications site from the 3300-acre West Jay fire
in the Clearwater National Forest east of Lewiston. More than $3
million in commercial timber has been lost, mostly to the
7,500-acre Eagle Bar fire near Hells Canyon on the Oregon border.
   The terrain is parched by a second straight year of drought, and
Gov. Cecil Andrus put the entire state under an extreme fire
emergency.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forces battling Oregon's biggest forest fire, the 35,700-acre
lightning-sparked Tepee Butte blaze in the state's northeastern
corner, were more than doubled Tuesday to 679 people.
   In the state's eastern high desert, firefighters expected to
contain today the Shirttail Creek fire, 30 miles southeast of
Baker. The fire broke out Monday in an industrial area and burned
5,000 acres of rangeland.
   More than 52,000 acres have burned since lighting storms touched
off fires last week.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Monday and early Tuesday ignited
more than 170 brush and timber blazes in California, a year after a
similar storm spawned devastating fires.
   Although most of the fires were kept to an acre or less,
firefighters said hot, windy weather in the drought-parched forests
hindered their work.
   In the San Francisco Bay area, fire swept through dry brush and
trees Tuesday in Orinda, destroying five houses and badly damaging
two others. Police believe an electronically ignited toy rocket may
have sparked the blaze.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Favorable weather helped thousands of firefighters gain a handle
on major fires burning on more than 23,000 acres of trees and brush
in eastern Washington state.
   Winds were light Tuesday as crews cut trails around nearly 70
percent of separate major fires on the Colville Indian Reservation
and the Colville National Forest.
   The state's largest fire was on the Indian reservation, where
9,250 acres of timber and brush burned.

<HEAD>UTAH:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters predicted imminent control over a 525-acre fire
near northern Utah's Pineview Reservoir. Crews also were getting
the upper hand on two small fires, the 60-acre North Millcreek
blaze, in eastern Utah's Uinta Mountains, and the 30-acre
Butterfield Canyon fire in Salt Lake County.
   Also in northern Utah, Salt Lake County crews used shovels to
put the finishing touches on a 100-acre brush and grass fire in
Butterfield Canyon.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALASKA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As of Tuesday, 30 fires still smoldered on 2 million acres in
rural Alaska, the federal Bureau of Land Management said.
   Fires have charred 2.1 million acres in Alaska this year.
