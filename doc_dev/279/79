<LEADPARA>  Summer is the season for raucous families to emerge from their homes and
populate the national parks. It is therefore a good time to stay as far as you
can from these Edens and instead cocoon in your living room with a stack of
movies shot on location in America's playgrounds.;    Whether your taste runs
to Death Valley ("Zabriskie Point") or Niagara Falls ("Niagara"), the Grand
Canyon ("National Lampoon's Vacation") or the Grand Tetons ("Shane"),
moviemakers have made the trip so you don't have to.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even though they pay taxes just like the rest of us, Hollywood production
companies can't just reserve campsites and go off shooting. No fee is required
of production companies for access to the parks (though some have made
generous -- and unsolicited -- donations), but film makers do need permission,
and that permission is not always forthcoming.;    While the rules governing
film-crew access are, in the main, predictable -- opposing damage to resources
or interruption of visitor activity -- the right to film in any specific
jurisdiction is controlled by the region's superintendent. And, according to
George Berklacy, chief of public affairs for the National Parks Service,
"superintendents are given considerable latitude in setting policies.";    Or,
as Fran Wigglesworth, spokesperson for the Washington, D.C., regional
headquarters for the National Parks Service, puts it, "A park that doesn't
have the Lincoln Memorial sitting in it would probably have different rules
from one that does.";    She points out, for instance, that "national wildlife
refuges have very stiff criteria for usage . . . relating to the reproductive
seasons of the specific animals there." Such archaeologically sensitive sites
as Colorado's Mesa Verde National Park, home to prehistoric cliff dwellings,
also have been strictly protected.;    Some film makers have managed to get
their spectacular location shots by using sites, such as Indian reservations,
that look like more famous national parks. John Ford's beloved Monument
Valley, for one, isn't under the purview of the Parks Service and therefore
makes a convenient look-alike for the Grand Canyon.;    Still, the placing of
discretion in the hands of individual superintendents can create unforeseeable
obstacles for film companies. Film makers are prohibited from using the Grand
Canyon, for instance, to depict what a spokesperson there euphemistically
refers to as "illegal activity not a normal part of park use" -- drug dealing,
say.  </TEXT>
