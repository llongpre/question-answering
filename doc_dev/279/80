   Pro-democracy demonstrations around the world and
fear gripping the Southeast after recent mail bombings are adding
meaning to this year's celebrations honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
   Bells in 144 countries and the 50 United States will ring out
simultaneously and Wall Street will pause for a moment of silence
Monday on what would have been the slain civil-rights leader's 61st
birthday.
   For the first time, King's birthday will be celebrated on a
large scale in white-ruled South Africa. A weeklong celebration
will climax Jan. 20, when about 10,000 people are expected at a
Johannesburg event honoring black leaders including Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak.
   In this country, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire have not
recognized the day as a state holiday. But organizers said bells
will ring in those states, and in the 47 states with King holidays,
at 12:30 p.m. EST, when the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia is tapped.
   In King's hometown of Atlanta, the center of King Week
celebrations, the 1990 holiday comes amid death threats that
followed last month's mail bombings of civil rights and judicial
targets in three Southeastern states.
   ``With the Klan and the mail bombs, this year it has a more
special meaning for everybody,'' said state Sen. Arthur Langford,
who portrays King in a yearly production of Langford's play ``Life
of a King.''
   ``People must understand that, in the words of Dr. King, we must
learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will perish
together as fools.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said she will try to deflect
attention from the racial violence.
   ``To talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind
of violence,'' she said last week in announcing the week's events.
``It needs to be dealt with, but it needs to be dealt with in the
proper manner.''
   Mrs. King said she instead would emphasize pro-democracy
movements in Eastern Europe.
   ``The same philosophy, strategy and tactics of non-violence that
we used to break down the walls of segregation are now being used
to tear down the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain,'' she said.
   King Week 1990, sponsored by the King Center for Nonviolent
Social Change and the King Federal Holiday Commission, culminates
Monday, the first time the holiday has fallen on King's actual
birthday.
   King led a non-violent movement for racial equality in the 1950s
and 1960s that led to passage of federal legislation ending
official discrimination and segregation. He was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.
   In addition to the three states without King holidays, an
official King Day in Arizona is on hold. Wyoming's will be
celebrated for the first time, but only this year.
   In Arizona, Gov. Rose Mofford last fall signed into law a bill
to create a paid state holiday. But opponents filed petitions
calling for a referendum, keeping the law from becoming effective
until the vote. A King Day breakfast in Phoenix, however, is
expected to draw 1,500.
   Wyoming's Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan bucked the wishes of the
Republican-controlled Legislature and issued an executive order
calling for the holiday. However, the order only applies this year.
   Events scheduled in Atlanta this year include the unveiling of a
sculpture at the King memorial center and a speech by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
   A parade along Peachtree Street will conclude Monday's events
and will be nationally televised for the first time.
   Stoney Johnson, King Center media director, said security will
not be increased during any of the center's King Week activities
despite the mail bombs.
   ``It's so intense anyway that we don't need any more,'' he said.
   But Danny Levitan, executive director of the Center for
Democratic Renewal, which tracks hate group activity, warned that
violence may erupt in Atlanta just after King Day and the rest of
the nation ``should expect some attempts to disrupt events or
commit acts of violence'' Monday.
   On Jan. 20, Mississippi white supremacist Richard Barrett plans
a protest on National Park Service property across from King's
crypt in Atlanta. Park Service lawyers are reviewing the plan but
are expected to grant Barrett a permit, agency spokesman Paul
Winegar said.
