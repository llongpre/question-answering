   Here is a brief outline of forest fire conditions Tuesday in the
Western states:

   Eight forest fires are burning in Yellowstone National Park with
four in the surrounding national forests in northwestern Wyoming.
   The Yellowstone Fires, some of which have spread out into the
forests, had charred about 450,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre
park. The largest fire outside Yellowstone, the Mink Creek fire,
covers 107,960 acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   Yellowstone officials said they have spent $54.4 million
fighting fires and about 8,400 firefighters, including hundreds of
Army soldiers, are working in the area.
   Unusually dry weather and a rash of lightning storms opened the
fire season early this year, with the first Yellowstone fires
reported in June.

   Eight major fires had burned 177,000 acres of Montana forests
Tuesday, including two that erupted into serious threats overnight.
They ranged in size up to 41,000 acres. Four, totaling 128,700
acres, were in designated wilderness areas, including one that had
spread into Yellowstone National Park. Firefighters were gaining
the upper hand on most, however, and no populated areas were
threatened.

   More than 2,500 firefighters, backed up by dozens of National
Guardsmen, were on the lines against the worst of 17 fires burning
over 70,000 acres from the Panhandle National Forest to the Caribou
National Forest on the Wyoming border.
   No structures were in imminent danger, but crews were protecting
summer homes from the 16,000-acre Battle Axe wilderness fire
northeast of Challis, a communications site from the 330-acre West
Jay fire in the Clearwater National Forest east of Lewiston and
ranches from the 5,000-acre Trail Creek fire near the Wyoming
border in the Caribou. Some $3 million in commercial timber has
been lost, mostly to the 7,400-acre Eagle Bar fire near Hells
Canyon on the Oregon border.
   The terrain is parched by a second straight year of drought, and
Gov. Cecil Andrus has put the entire state under an extreme fire
emergency.

   Forces battling Oregon's biggest forest fire, the 31,000-acre
lightning-sparked Tepee Butte blaze in the northeastern corner of
the state, were doubled Tuesday to 545 people, said spokesman Ron
DeHart.
   The Walker Mountain fire outside Grants Pass was contained
Monday night at 2,150 acres.
   In the eastern high desert, a fire at a cement plant in Durkee
quickly burned through 5,000 acres of rangeland, and a trash fire
touched off 527 acres on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.

<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>

   Nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Monday and early Tuesday ignited
more than 100 brush and timber blazes in California, a year after a
similar storm spawned devastating firestorms, officials said.
   Although most of the fires were kept small, to the size of an
acre or less, firefighters said they were by hot, windy weather in
the drought-parched forests.
   The town of Portola in the northern Sierra Nevada, about 180
miles northeast of San Francisco, narrowly escaped flames Monday
night when lightning-caused fires swept together. The fires that
had burned about 1,000 acres were 60 percent contained Tuesday.

   The Forest Service said it battled fires on an estimated 22,530
acres during the past week, said Ron DeHart of a multi-agency fire
regional fire coordinating center at Portland, Ore.
   Tim Boyd of the state Department of Natural Resources said that
agency had fought 690 fires on 5,557 acres of private and state
land as of Sunday. That figure does not include the 1,500-acre
Aeneas Creek blaze northeast of Republic, nor several smaller fires
of less than 100 acres in eastern Washington.

<HEAD>UTAH:</HEAD>

   Firefighters hoped to declare control over a 525-acre fire near
northern Utah's Pineview Reservoir. Crews also were getting the
upper hand on two small fires, the 60-acre North Millcreek blaze,
in eastern Utah's Uinta Mountains, and the 30-acre Butterfield
Canyon fire in Salt Lake County.
   No injuries or damage were reported in any of the fires, and
authorities said no structures were threatened.

<HEAD>ALASKA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As of Tuesday, there were 30 fires still smoldering on 2 million
acres in rural Alaska, the federal Bureau of Land Management said.
   ``We're monitoring them, but not fighting them,'' said Sue
Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the agency. ``I don't think we have any
blazing, active fires right now.''
   So far this year, fires have charred 2.1 million acres of land
in Alaska.
