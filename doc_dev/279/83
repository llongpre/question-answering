   Martin Luther King Jr. ``would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs'' if he were living,
Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan said today at an observance
of the slain civil rights leader's birthday.
   ``There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There
is no dream,'' Lujan told an overflow crowd in the 850-seat
auditorium of the Interior Department.
   ``There is only the nightmare of the fatal consequences of drug
use,'' he said. ``Martin Luther King would not stand for drug use
and neither should we.''
   ``Part of our commitment to educating young Americans must
include programs to discourage them from the deadly scourge of
drugs,'' Lujan told the audience.
   ``If Dr. King were alive today, he would be marching
hand-in-hand in the war against drugs, fighting to stop the next
generation from destroying itself,'' he said.
   C.T. Vivian, a former member of King's staff who now heads the
Black Action Strategies and Information Center, told the crowd in
which black people were in a slight preponderance, ``We would not
be meeting in this room right now if it were not for Martin King.''
   ``We knew the central prophet of our time,'' said Vivian. ``He
created the atmosphere in which we grew.''
   Later, a slightly smaller crowd gathered for a wreath-laying
ceremony outside the Lincoln Memorial, where King delivered his
celebrated ``I have a dream'' speech in the climax of a civil
rights march in 1963.
   James M. Ridenour, director of the National Park Service, told
the group, ``The sound of Dr. King's words still rings in our ears.
As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can feel his
presence.''
   King, leader of the black civil rights movement in America, was
shot to death April 4, 1968, in Memphis. James Earl Ray is serving
a life sentence for the slaying. King's birthday is being observed
Monday as a federal holiday. He was born Jan. 15, 1929.
