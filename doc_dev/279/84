   Wildfires Sunday threatened centuries-old
giant sequoia trees in the state's mid-section and crackled toward
homes along the mountain ridges surrounding Los Angeles.
   The fires erupted during another California fall heat wave with
temperatures nudging 100 degrees in many areas and Santa Ana winds,
dried and heated by inland deserts, reaching 30 mph.
   More than 3,500 acres were blackened in the fires, several of
them man-caused, authorities said. A wind-pushed 2,000-acre blaze
in the Angeles National Forest endangered homes in the path of the
flames 30 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The fire's huge brown smoke plume, rising 7,000 feet skyward,
could be seen 50 miles away at Los Angeles International Airport.
   Mountain residents of the northeast San Fernando Valley were put
on alert but no evacuations were ordered. About 200 firefighters
were battling the blaze and hundreds more were on the way late in
the afternoon.
   ``This one is giving us real problems,'' said U.S. Forest
Service spokesman Bruce Bundick. ``It's going in about three
different directions faster than we can corral it.''
   About 160 miles northwest, firefighters battling a 600-acre fire
in Sequoia National Park were optimistic a buffer zone cleared in a
previous controlled burn would save the magnificent trees in the
3-square-mile Giant Forest, said park spokesman Bill Tweed.
   The ancient trees are considered the largest living things on
Earth.
   ``These are certainly one of the biological wonders of the
world,'' Tweed said. ``The fire will inevitably reach the edge of
the Giant Forest. We think that because of the steps taken, we can
prevent it from going into the forest.''
   About 100 campers fled the flames, which started at 8 a.m. in
Potwisha Camp Ground about 30 miles northeast of Visalia. A
careless camper or angler was the suspected cause of the blaze,
Tweed said.
   Another fire 85 miles southeast of Los Angeles in Riverside
County charred 800 acres near Hemet, but firefighters were gaining
the upper hand and containment was anticipated by dawn Monday, said
Joanne Evans, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Forestry.
   Two smaller fires erupted in the mountainous eastern portion of
the Angeles National Forest. One, started by children playing with
matches and a cigarette lighter, destroyed a house.
