   Fire-plagued Yellowstone National Park reopened its south gate
Thursday for the first time in almost two weeks, but was forced to
close the west entrance late in the day when a 109,100-acre blaze
flared up.
   Elsewhere in the West, officials took measures to keep hunters,
fishers and campers out of the woods over Labor Day weekend.
   In eastern Oregon, officials banned recreational users from 3.8
million acres of state-protected forest and range land, effective
Friday _ the first day of the long holiday weekend. Already closed
are 2.8 million acres of land in western Oregon.
   ``The state needs to limit the risk of wildfire, and this has
proven to be an effective way to do that,'' State Forester James E.
Brown said.
   Last year, 10.3 million acres in western Oregon were closed to
the public for 11 days because of extreme fire danger. In that
period, fires blamed on human activities dropped from six to one a
day, said Kathy Apling, a state forestry spokeswoman.
   Strict fire restrictions have also been imposed throughout
Washington state, said Kathy Albert, a Forest Service spokesperson.
   ``Our message to everyone is no campfires unless in developed
campsites, with the exception of using a pressurized-liquid gas
camping stove,'' she said.
   Fires also burned Thursday in Montana, Utah, Washington, Idaho
and California.
   In Montana, the hunting season was scheduled to begin Thursday,
but a reluctant state Fish and Game Commission agreed _ at the
request of Gov. Ted Schwinden _ to postpone the start of all
hunting seasons until Sept. 16 because of the fire danger.
   The delay affected as many as 75,000 hunters, state officials
said.
   Schwinden had succinct advice for people who were thinking about
going to the woods over the weekend: ``Find some asphalt.''
   Ten major fires burned in the state Thursday.
   One of two huge fires north of Yellowstone tore through a fire
line late Wednesday and continued burning toward a dude ranch, fire
officials in Montana said.
   ``We've got major fires on both sides of the Silvertip Ranch,''
fire information officer Chris Comstock said Thursday. The Storm
Creek and the Hellroaring Creek fires in the Absaroka-Beartooth
Wilderness have charred more than 90,000 acres and were only three
miles apart.
   ``Down-canyon'' wind blew the flames of the Storm Creek blaze
through a 5.5-mile fire line that crews had spent four days
building in rugged country, fire information officer Nick Tafoya
said.
   Near West Yellowstone, Mont., crews used bulldozers to carve a
12-foot wide fire line between the gateway town and the western
flank of the North Fork fire inside the nation's oldest national
park. The gray sky seemed to be raining ash Thursday afternoon,
with visibility was down to a half mile and a light breeze keeping
the snow-like ash in the air.
   By nighttime, ``slop-over'' from the fire line reached within 1{
miles of West Yellowstone.
   ``There's a lot of flame and a lot of smoke out there. The fire
is extremely visible from town,'' said Kathy Good, a U.S. Forest
Service spokesman in West Yellowstone.
   All five gates to the park and all roads within it were open for
a tim Thursday, until the worsening conditions caused the closure
of the west entrance. Park spokesman Bill Stalker said the west
entrance was expected to reopen within a few hours once the spot
fires were taken care of.
   The park's chief naturalist, George Robinson, said officials
anticipated that the fires ``will keep burning until the first
heavy winter snows.''
   In Oregon, the Tepee Butte fire, the state's largest wildfire
this year, has burned 40,316 acres of grass and timber in the
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon National
Recreation Area, said Ron DeHart, spokesman for the multiagency
fire coordination center in Portland. The fire will grow to 59,000
acres before it reaches fire lines, DeHart added.
   Firefighters struggled to contain five major fires in the
mountain ranges of Northern California.
   A 6-year-old boy playing with matches started a fire Wednesday
that destroyed two homes and charred 560 acres south of Mariposa, a
town 150 miles east of San Francisco, said Kary Weaver, a state
department of forestry spokeswoman. About 100 people were evacuated
from the neighborhood, she said.
   One of three major fires in northeastern Washington state roared
through containment lines, but authorities reported progress in
containing the other two blazes. Wildfires have charred more than
24,500 acres in the state.
   In Idaho, more than 3,000 firefighters remained on the lines of
the worst of the 17 major fires burning over 70,000 acres.
   Overnight winds whipped a once-controlled fire near northern
Utah's Pineview Reserevoir into a fast-moving inferno that jumped
fire lines and more than doubled to 1,200 acres by Thursday, fire
officials said.'
