   The voice of Martin Luther King rang out once
more at the Lincoln Memorial on Friday as government officials and
school children joined in a birthday observance highlighted by a
recording of the slain civil rights leader's ``I have a dream''
speech.
   ``As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can
feel his presence,'' James M. Ridenour, director of the National
Park Service, told a crowd of several hundred assembled in chilly,
windy weather at the memorial.
   Effi Barry, wife of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry,
blinked back tears as the recording came to the climax of King's
speech, ending with the words, ``free at last, free at last, thank
God almighty, we are free at last.''
   Later, Ms. Barry joined Ridenour and two children representing
District of Columbia schools in laying three floral wreaths at the
memorial in honor of King.
   King was shot to death April 4, 1968, in Memphis. Had he lived,
he would be 61 on Monday. His speech at the memorial was the climax
of a civil rights march in 1963.
   As King's voice spoke of his dream that ``little black boys and
black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and
little white girls as sisters and brothers,'' a massed choir from
the district's public elementary schools stood on the memorial
steps. All but a few of the youngsters were black.
   Earlier, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. told an
overflow crowd in the 850-seat Interior Department auditorium, ``If
Dr. King were alive today, he would be marching hand-in-hand in the
war against drugs, fighting to stop the next generation from
destroying itself.''
   ``There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There
is no dream,'' Lujan said. ``There is only the nightmare of the
fatal consequences of drug use. Martin Luther King would not stand
for drug use and neither should we.''
   C.T. Vivian, a former member of King's staff who now heads the
Black Action Strategies and Information Center, told the crowd,
``We would not be meeting in this room right now if it were not for
Martin King.''
   ``We knew the central prophet of our time,'' said Vivian. ``He
created the atmosphere in which we grew.''
