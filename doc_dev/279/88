   Giant 2,000-year-old
sequoias were treated with fire retardant to protect them against
flames advancing today through the majestic forest that
photographer Ansel Adams captured on film.
   In Oregon, 1,200 Army soldiers were being sent to take up
firefighting positions. Fires also burned in Alaska, Washington,
Idaho and Utah.
   Drought and the threat of more lightning in California worried
fire officials after more than 200,000 acres burned statewide in
the past week.
   ``More lightning means more fires,'' said Forestry Department
spokesman Chris Parker. ``What we're seeing is the culmination of
four years' drought.''
   Yosemite was declared off limits to tourists Friday. By Sunday,
more than 2,200 firefighters were battling two fires in the park
that have burned 17,000 acres. The flames were about 10 miles from
landmarks like El Capitan, Half Dome and Yosemite Falls, and within
two miles of a stand of giant sequoias.
   Workers tried to protect the trees by clearing debris and
undergrowth from around their trunks and applying a chemical fire
retardant.
   Seventy-five people fled a park settlement Sunday to escape the
one of the fires.
   Fires have burned 127 structures since last week in California
ranging from outbuildings to homes. Sixty-six were in Foresta, near
Yosemite. The park, which usually gets 25,000 weekend visitors, was
empty of tourists.
   ``There's a degree of peacefulness, if you are not caught up in
the frantic business of firefighting,'' said Jeff Nicholas, curator
of Yosemite's Ansel Adams photo gallery.
   More than $10 million in property has been destroyed by the
fires, Yosemite fire officials said Sunday. The cost of fighting
the fire had passed $1.5 million Sunday evening.
   The park's chief naturalist, Len McKenzie, called the fires
catastrophic and blamed past park management for the size and
intensity of the blazes. By suppressing all wildfires in the
forest, he said, a huge buildup of dead wood, dry grass and other
fuel built up.
   ``We overprotected the forest,'' he said.
   Thunderstorms like those that brought 24,000 recorded lightning
strikes last week to California were expected to return by Tuesday.
The state has had below-average precipitation since the mid-1980s.
   In Tehama County, about 200 miles north of Yosemite, two blazes
have charred a combined 130,000 acres of forest. In Sequoia
National Forest, about 100 miles south of Yosemite, a fire had
burned more than 24,000 acres.
   ``The 200,000-acre figure for the state is probably pretty
conservative,'' said Forestry Department spokeswoman Karen Terrill.
``What I hear the experts saying is that this could get to be much,
much worse.''
   More than 12,000 firefighters were on duty around the state,
most of them battling 14 major fires.
   More than 6,000 people worked Sunday to corral five lightning
fires that have burned more than 120,000 acres of eastern Oregon,
said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Guest. About 100 soldiers
from Fort Lewis, Wash., were sent to Oregon on Sunday. A total of
1,100 more were to follow today after some quick training.
   A mule deer and its fawn returned to a charred area after
surviving the largest of the Oregon fires. ``It's nice to see the
animals come back,'' said Risa Lange-Navarro, a Forest Service
field observer.
   Oregon's two largest fires, measuring 73,700 acres and 18,925
acres, were expected to be encircled by fire lines today. A third
was surrounded late Sunday and firefighters reported making headway
in trying to control the two others.
   Several smaller lightning-sparked fires kept Washington
firefighters busy. A rash of forest and range fires that broke out
in Idaho last week were brought under control Sunday.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates
the fighting of forest fires around the country, said nearly 20,000
firefighters were at work Sunday on fires covering 856,000 acres,
more than half of that in Alaska.
   The weather cooperated with firefighters battling blazes
throughout Utah as rain and higher humidity helped crews contain
the state's two biggest blazes and slow the spread of several
others.
