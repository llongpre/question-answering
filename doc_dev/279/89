Huddled on the snowy bank of the Snake River at Moose, Dornan's may be the 
world's most scenic bar. Before its picture window, skiers gather to sip Irish 
coffee at sunset and pay homage to the stunning mountain panorama. Peaks and 
jagged pinnacles tower over this valley like a Gothic cathedral. The Grand 
Tetons, a choir of majestic granite spires, trumpet their beauty through the 
high country basin called Jackson Hole. 
</P>
<P>
While Jackson Hole offers an unspoiled paradise for winter recreation, the 
region resounds with a sanctity and power that enrich the spirit. Dramatic 
vistas and wildlife abound. The valley is part of the largest chunk of 
wilderness left in the world's temperate zones. 
</P>
<P>
Named for Davey Jackson, a beaver trapper who claimed this "hole," or valley, 
his territory in the 1800s, Jackson Hole is hemmed in by mountains. The flat, 
mile-high valley reaches south from Yellowstone National Park for 50 miles, 
holding some of the West's most spectacular country, terminating here in the 
town of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Snow is powdery from Thanksgiving to Easter, and terrain to ski and explore 
remains virtually unlimited. Wide trails follow the course of the Snake River, 
a fertile habitat for wildlife. Flocks of ducks and teams of trumpeter swans 
honk their greetings as the fish-filled river winds its way along the valley

floor from headwaters deep in Yellowstone. In this primitive environment you're 
more likely to meet a moose than another skier. 
</P>
<P>
Ski beneath the Tetons and experience nature's symphony. Wind whistles in steep 
glacier-carved canyons where streams chime with melting snow. A chain of lakes 
shimmer; chickadees carol in meadows at the foot of misty gabled peaks. The 
refulgent landscape is a balm and benediction. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to some farsighted folks, the region remains a living paradigm of 
primordial Western America. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Rockefeller donated much of the land now included in Grand Teton 
National Park. Local writer Margaret Murie, 87, energetically carries on the 
conservation cause. 
</P>
<P>
Only 3% of Teton County is privately owned, and the rest is protected within 
the national park, Bridger-Teton National Forest and the National Elk Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation efforts do not keep out modern recreation. The pleasures of high 
mountain helicopter and downhill skiing, snowmobiling, ice skating, snowshoe 
hiking and dude ranching are plentiful. You can take a moonlit sleigh ride, go 
by dog sled to dinner or drive a snowmobile to Granite Hot Springs for a soak 
in nature's own Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide-Open Spaces 
</P>
<P>
Downhill skiers have a profusion of wide-open spaces. Three major ski areas 
include more than 5,000 acres of slopes and trails and an aerial tram. Snow 
King Mountain, imposing backdrop for the colorful town of Jackson, is Wyoming's 
oldest ski area. 
</P>
<P>
At family-oriented Grand Targhee Resort on the west side of the Tetons, snow is 
so light and deep that few slopes even need grooming. Targhee averages more 
than 500 inches of annual snowfall and claims the best powder skiing in the 
northern Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole Ski Resort at Teton Village boasts the longest vertical drop in 
the nation. Towering 10,000 feet over the village, the resort's Rendezvous 
Mountain offers a kaleidoscope of trails -- through powder bowls, gladed 
meadows and fragrant forests. 
</P>
<P>
All three resorts stage annual torchlight parades down mountain slopes as part 
of their Christmas and New Year's Eve festivities. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the area's stark, pastoral elegance, Jackson has a lively Wild 
West character. Covered wooden walkways, Western storefronts and a cluster of 
cowboy saloons create a rustic atmosphere. Huge arches of elk antlers mark the 
Jackson town square and serve as the Jackson logo. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants such as the Silver Sage (on the south side of the square) and the 
Sojourner Stockman, at the Sojourner Inn at Teton Village, specialize in steaks 
and barbecue. Others pride themselves on their au courant atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mangy Moose Saloon 
</P>
<P>
 Off-Broadway (30 S. King St., one block from the square) creates trendy fresh 
seafood and pasta dishes. The Cadillac Grille (on the west side of the square) 
fiddles with nouvelle cuisine in Art Deco interiors. You can sip a cappuccino 
at cozy Cafe Varnet (82 S. King St.) or nurse a beer at the popular Mangy Moose 
saloon at Teton Village. 
</P>
<P>
For country music, check out the bands at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar on the 
square or the Silver Dollar Bar in the historic Wort Hotel. The bars are 
embedded with silver dollars and the dance floors are swinging night spots. 
</P>
<P>
The largest herd of elk in North America winters on the northern edge of 
Jackson, protected by the National Elk Refuge. Schedule a picturesque sleigh 
ride into their midst at the refuge visitor center for close views. You'll see 
thousands of the animals in their own habitat, stags cracking horns, then 
locked in battle. 
</P>
<P>
Elk is what brought Margaret E. (Mardy) Murie here. Her husband, Olaus Murie, a 
field biologist for the U.S. Biological Survey, came to study the declining elk 
herd in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preservation Role 
</P>
<P>
His studies soon became world famous, and the two stayed to raise their family. 
Olaus Murie played an important role in preserving two major wilderness areas: 
Grand Teton National Park and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Murie made her own mark as teacher and author. ("Two in the Far 
North," describing her Alaskan childhood, is still in print.) 
</P>
<P>
With her special warmth and humble eloquence, Mardy is known as the 
conservationists' "grand doyenne." The salons in her log house tucked beneath 
the Tetons, on a bend in the river near the park visitor center in Moose, 
attract well-known political figures and naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem now is not the amount of lands that are under state, private or 
federal jurisdiction, but whether we can keep our souls receptive to the 
message of peace this unspoiled landscape offers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole celebrates the grandeur of nature and the spirit of people acting 
for a noble cause. What's more, it's tops for winter recreation. 
</P>
