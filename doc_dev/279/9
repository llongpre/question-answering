<LEADPARA>  Not since the days of John Muir have so many people spoken so loudly about the
Sierra Nevada.;   Almost everything about the Sierra -- its forests, streams,
wildlife, national parks, small towns, ski areas and air quality -- is under
scrutiny.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SUMMIT TALKS TO FOCUS ON FUTURE OF THE SIERRA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Tense words are in the air. One group worries about ozone pollution and
overcutting on national forests. Another fumes about "enviro-wackos" and "land
grabs.";   The catalyst for all the attention is a historic, state-sponsored
"Sierra Summit," set to begin Sunday at the Stanford Sierra Camp at Fallen
Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe.;   The summit, prompted by a series of articles in
The Sacramento Bee newspaper earlier this year, is expected to bring together
top officials from federal, state and county agencies, the state Legislature,
private industry, the University of California and the conservation
community.;   At issue is the future of one of North America's most majestic
mountain ranges.;   Pioneers feared it. Early conservationists, led by Muir,
worshiped it. The forty-niners plundered it. Today, everybody from timber mill
owners to tourists want a piece of it.;   Among those expected to attend are
the regional directors of the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, the regional forester for the U.S. Forest Service, the
executive director of the California Ski Industry Association, presidents of
the California Farm Bureau and California Forestry Association,
superintendents of Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks,
conservationist David Brower and many others.;   California's Secretary for
Resources Doug Wheeler, organizer of the conference, has said he hopes the
summit will provide a forum to discuss the need for long-range reform in the
Sierra.  </TEXT>
