<LEADPARA>  Walt Disney in Yosemite National Park?;    The king of theme parks is
apparently interested in the crown jewel of America's national parks, where
the restaurants and hotels are for sale by the new Tokyo-based owner who
worries about an anti-Japanese backlash, an Interior Department source said
Thursday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Representatives of the Walt Disney Co., along with Marriott Corp. and Time
Warner Inc., have all called the Interior Department over the last few days
and "expressed interest" in bidding on the park's concession monopoly,
according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.;    Meanwhile,
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and MCA Inc. President Sidney Sheinberg
continued their public mudslinging over Yosemite on Thursday. Up and down the
television dial, each accused the other of foul play since Tokyo-based
Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp.'s $7.5 billion takeover Saturday of
American entertainment giant MCA Inc., which also owns the Yosemite Park and
Curry Co.;    Lujan wants the Curry concession -- valued at anywhere from $40
million to $300 million -- donated to the Park Service and raises the specter
of the Japanese owning a national treasure.;    "This is such a small part of
their overall deal," he said.;    Sheinberg accuses Lujan of "Japan-bashing"
and says MCA isn't giving away its concession. MCA and Matsushita also hired
two Manhattan investment banking firms to expedite the sale.;    "They have
already started their search," the Interior Department source said. And the
apparent suitors are all competitors of MCA, either in Hollywood or Yosemite.;
   Disney, with $700 million in profits in 1989, has battled MCA's Universal
Studios with its own film subsidiary, Touchstone Pictures, and is a veteran in
the resort business with its California and Florida theme parks.;    "We don't
comment on rumors," Disney spokesman Tom Deegan said Thursday. "We wouldn't
say anything unless we had an announcement to make.";    New York-based Time
Warner is another Hollywood film rival of MCA's.;    The Washington,
D.C.-based Marriott Corp. in June opened a 242-room motel just outside the
Yosemite park boundary on Highway 41 in Fish Camp.;    Company spokesman Terry
Souers said he hadn't heard of Marriott's being interested in the Yosemite
concession.;    Asked if MCA was searching for a Curry Co. buyer, spokeswoman
Christine Hanson said: "We're not going to not look." Asked about the three
reported suitors, she said: "I have no comment on that.";    After Matsushita
announced its plans to purchase MCA in November, the two firms sought Lujan's
approval to place the Curry Co. in a special escrow arrangement that would
allow MCA to sell the Curry Co. to a "qualified American buyer." While looking
for the buyer, MCA pledged to donate all the profits Curry made to the
National Park Foundation.;    The companies thought the plan would appease
Lujan's concern of Curry's becoming the first foreign-owned park
concessionaire. But Lujan has refused to go along with the deal, instead
pushing for a donation. MCA said no.;    Saturday, without Lujan's approval,
Matsushita officially became the owner of the Curry Co. and all of MCA. It
hasn't placed the Curry Co. in escrow.;    Lujan has asked his staff to
determine whether the Curry Co. breached its government contract by changing
owners without his approval. If so, he has threatened to find a new
concessionaire.;    Longtime park activists fear a for-profit corporation
might try to increase commercialism in Yosemite in order to pay for the
purchase of the Curry Co.;    While Lujan and MCA continue their tirades on
television, the two sides apparently aren't talking in private. MCA had no
direct conversations with the government Thursday, Hanson said.;    And
Congress now wants a say in all this. U.S. Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman
of the House national parks and public lands subcommittee, announced plans to
hold a hearing next week over the Yosemite contract. Vento said he was
concerned about foreign ownership of facilities at one of the major national
parks, but acknowledged there is no law against it.;    "Most of these laws
(on park concessions) were set up to deal with mom and pop organizations," not
international conglomerates, he said.  </TEXT>
