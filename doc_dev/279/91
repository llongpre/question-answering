   From Independence Hall to Yosemite National
Park, America's best known landmarks are already feeling the sting
of the federal budget crisis.
   The roof at Independence Hall leaks. Yosemite had to scale back
its 100th birthday party. And a Texas memorial had to cancel a
popular folk festival for the first time in 18 years.
   Things could get worse.
   The cash crunch threatens to make the Washington Monument into a
massive symbol not only of America's first president, but of a
government unable to operate its historic treasures.
   Absent a congressional budget agreement before Monday, the
monument would have to close on the two days producing the least
number of visitors - probably Mondays and Tuesdays, the National
Park Service said Thursday.
   For years, the park service has been accused of ``gamesmanship''
by threatening to close such a visible and popular monument, said
park service spokesman Duncan Morrow.
   ``The Washington Monument has been the great symbol of the
budget game for several years. But under the basic rules of
Gramm-Rudman (the budget deficit law), each park is a separate item
that has to get the same degree of cut,'' Morrow said
   The Statue of Liberty would also shut down two days a week, the
park service said.
   Budgets are already lean at national parks and monuments. But
administrators are preparing for the possibility that the president
may have to order automatic spending cuts Monday, the first day of
the government's 1991 fiscal year.
   That would force most government agencies, including the park
service, to trim expenses by 32.4 percent.
   Already, Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park
has announced the indefinite closing of the Second Bank of the
United States, the Marine Corps Museum, the Army-Navy Museum and
Old City Hall.
   The park's most popular attractions - the Liberty Bell and
Independence Hall - remain open. But Independence Hall's roof is in
disrepair, prompting an urgent plea from Rep. Thomas Foglietta,
D-Pa., not to allow ``a vital part of this country's history'' to
``slide into ruin.''
   Provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit law
require the park service to impose reductions evenhandedly on its
nearly 600 parks, programs and activities. Parks could choose to
absorb the cuts in different ways.
   At Grand Canyon National Park, the 32.4 percent cut would
probably mean reductions in the number of seasonal staff, said
spokesman Chuck Lundy. That could jeopardize operation of the park
entrance stations, which collect $5 fees from motorists.
   In Hawaii, the USS Arizona memorial to Americans killed at Pearl
Harbor would close one or two days a week, said chief ranger Gary
Warshefski.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan would be unable to attend
Yosemite's long-planned 100th anniversary celebration, scheduled
for next week.
   ``How can you justify to a furloughed worker the price of a
plane ticket to fly across the country for a ceremony?'' Morrow
asked.
   Administrators of the Chamizal National Memorial in El Paso,
Texas, canceled next week's $70,000 music and dance festival
celebrating a bridge of U.S. and Latin American cultures. The
memorial marks the settlement of an American-Mexican border
dispute.
   ``It's sort of a heartbreaker to everybody. After 17 years, we
were starting to think we were secure,'' said memorial
Superintendent Frank Smith.
