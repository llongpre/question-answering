A 10-mile stretch of California 94, from downtown San Diego to its interchange 
with California 125 in La Mesa, was formally christened Monday as the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Four green-and-white signs, each 14 feet long by 3 1/2 feet wide, along the 
state route were unveiled Monday at a press conference officially acknowledging 
the name change, San Diego's latest effort to find a permanent memorial for the 
slain civil-rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, the memorial issue has thrust the city in a racially and 
politically divisive debate. The renaming of the freeway has been one of the 
least favorite choices of San Diego's black community. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, a black community leader who has fought to have the 
San Diego Convention Center named for King, said at the unveiling that, 
although he supports renaming the freeway, he isn't satisfied, and that San 
Diego must still deal with what he called racism and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, the San Diego City Council decided against seeking a name 
change for California 94 and instead voted to designate Market Street as Martin 
Luther King Way. But, a year later, San Diego voters rescinded that decision by 
overwhelmingly approving a referendum that restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, a private group, led by members of the Chamber of Commerce, 
worked with black leaders to find another replacement, settling on a 
scholarship fund and King statue to be built in Balboa Park. Fund raising for 
the $750,000 goal has stalled at about $150,000, civic leaders said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Also attempting to move ahead was the City Council, which called on the Board 
of Port Commissioners to name the new convention center in King's honor, a 
recommendation pushed by the King Tribute Advisory Board. The group held a 
series of eight poorly attended public hearings before voting on its 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
By last July, the port board decided by a 4-3 vote to keep King's name off the 
center, which opens to the public Friday as the San Diego Convention Center. A 
Stevens-led group has promised to protest and picket the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
It was after that vote that Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and state 
Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula Vista) introduced a resolution asking the 
Legislature to rename California 94. The Legislature approved the request in 
September, specifying, however, that private donations be used to pay for the 
new signs. 
</P>
<P>
The Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway Committee was formed to raise the money. Its 
chairman is Bishop George McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God in 
Christ on Imperial Avenue. Sharing the leadership of the group are Gordon C. 
Luce, chairman of Great American Bank; Kim Fletcher, chairman of HomeFed Bank, 
and Deddeh. 
</P>
<P>
The group has raised $1,400 of the $2,700 needed for the signs, according to a 
committee spokeswoman.
