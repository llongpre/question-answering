</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Distance runner Dan Berkeland of Canyon High has made an oral commitment to 
compete in cross-country and track at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeland said he chose the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. school because 
of its architecture program as well as its traditionally powerful cross-country 
and track teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang men's cross-country team has won the past two conference titles and 
has placed fourth or better in three of the past four NCAA Division II national 
meets. Cal Poly SLO also won this year's CCAA track and field title. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeland finished fifth in the state Division I cross-country championships 
last fall and timed 9 minutes 7.52 seconds for 3,200 meters in the Southern 
Section 4-A Division track meet in May. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover High's Creighton Harris and Gunnar Miller, major contributors to the 
Tornadoes' track and field team, have committed to attend Wisconsin and 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a Wisconsin native, qualified for the state meet in the 1,600 meters 
and has a personal-best 4:14.33 in the event. He also timed 1:58.60 for 800 and 
9:21.4 for 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 runner on Hoover's Pacific League championship cross-country team, 
Harris chose the Big Ten Conference school for its recent success in 
cross-country. The Badgers have won three NCAA Division I titles in the past 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Miller accepted a $12,000-a-year academic scholarship to Harvard, Hoover Coach 
Greg Switzer said, and will compete in the pole vault. Miller led regional 
vaulters with a 14-foot 6-inch mark. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Macias, the latest to pass through the revolving door of the Notre Dame 
High cross-country program, will coach the Knights this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Macias, who helped coach cross-country and track at Bell-Jeff the past two 
years, becomes Notre Dame's seventh cross-country coach in the past eight 
years.

Marcus Reed, a high-scoring guard for Canoga Park High, will attend College of 
the Sequoias in Visalia, according to Canoga Park Coach Jeff Davis.

Reed (5-foot-10, 155 pounds) averaged 20 points and 6.3 steals a game last 
season. Sequoias, coached by former Cal State Northridge assistant John 
Boragno, was ranked fourth in the final state junior college poll last season.

of new Coach Joe Harper as the Kingsmen's offensive coordinator.

Lutheran.

athletic scholarship, Canyons Coach Len Mohney said.

two other area players, Shon Tarver and Dedan Thomas, on the team.

basketball season, has committed to play at Antelope Valley College next 
season. Briggs, a 6-3 forward, averaged 16 points and seven rebounds for the 
Antelopes.
