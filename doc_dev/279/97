<HEADLINE>  2 BOYS STILL MISSING IN ICY YOSEMITE RIVER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A great-aunt of the boys, age 5 and 3, drowned early Saturday after she
apparently fell asleep at the wheel and missed a curve while they traveled to
a family reunion, said Kris Fister, a Yosemite National Park spokesman.;   
The youngsters, their 7-year-old sister, their grandmother and the great-aunt
climbed through a window onto the top of the car, which landed about 20 feet
from shore in the swollen Merced River.;    The boys jumped into the swift
current after passers-by threw a rope to the half-submerged vehicle and were
pulling their sister to safety, Fister said.;    "The little boys, seeing the
sister jump out, thought that was how they were going to be rescued and they
did jump in after her.";    The great-aunt, 44-year-old Elaine Watson, died
trying to rescue the boys. Fister identified the older boy as Lance Thomas Jr.
and his brother as Mario Thomas. Their grandmother, Pearl Watson Jordan, 62,
and their sister, Sequoia Thomas, survived. All are from Compton.;    Divers
searched shallow pools, and a dog that can sniff human scents through water
was led along a 2 1/2-mile stretch of river, said park ranger John Dill.
Searchers also scanned rough terrain from a helicopter.;    The success of the
search depended on how quickly snow melted in the high country and swelled the
already swift river, Dill said. Temperatures in Yosemite Valley were in the
mid-70s.;    "The river is running very fast, it's real cold and there are
trees and brush underwater that can trap people," Dill said.;    Dill said if
the bodies are caught by submerged debris in rougher waters, they may not be
recovered until the river dries up later this summer.;    The great-aunt's
body was recovered downstream and she was pronounced dead at Yosemite Medical
Clinic. The grandmother was rescued from the car by rangers. She and Sequoia
were treated for mild hypothermia at the clinic and released.  </TEXT>
