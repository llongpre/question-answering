   Black activists Tuesday pitched tents on Liberty
Island, forcing the closing of the Statue of Liberty, to mark the
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
   They also said they want to rename the city for the slain civil
rights leader.
   Separately, black construction workers drove a honking caravan
of trucks and backhoes to City Hall in a demand for more jobs.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a flamboyant and controversial activist,
and Lenora Fulani, who is running for governor on the New Alliance
Party ticket, led about 100 people from City Hall down Broadway to
Battery Park City, a skyscraper development at the lower tip of
Manhattan.
   ``We want to rename New York City, Martin Luther King City,''
Fulani said at a rally at Battery Park City. ``We want to reclaim
the city for our people.''
   They later headed out to Liberty Island, where Sharpton and an
estimated 40 to 80 supporters forced the closing of the Statue of
Liberty, said spokesman Manny Strump of the National Park Service.
The demonstrators pitched tents there in support of the homeless,
said Sharpton ally C. Vernon Mason.
   Strump said the island was closed at 2 p.m. for the remainder of
the day _ it normally closes at 5 p.m. Tourists were taken off the
island, he said.
   At about 5:15 p.m., 14 of the demonstrators, including Sharpton,
were ticketed for demonstrating without a permit, said Strumpf. The
14, who face $50 fines, then left the island peacefully on a park
service boat, Strumpf said. The rest of the demonstrators had left
on their own before the tickets were issued.
   On Aug. 28, 1963, King gave his ``I Have a Dream'' speech before
200,000 people in Washington.
