   Cold, damp weather retarded blazes and chilled firefighters at
Yellowstone National Park, and firefighters in California worked
Wednesday to put out hot spots and make Gold Rush County, where
nearly 100 homes burned, ``wind-proof.''
   But experts cautioned that the West's worst fire season in
decades wasn't necessarily over yet.
   The fires that have devastated nearly a million acres of the
nation's oldest national park have grown together to form a single
blaze, but cold, wet weather has helped firefighters, officials
said.
   ``It's been so cold out there the firefighters are coming in to
get warm, and that's really good if they can't stay warm fighting a
fire,'' said Denny Bungarz, a fire commander at Yellowstone, where
temperatures had dipped as low as the upper 20s overnight.
   Elsewhere, firefighters worked to complete lines around a
stubborn blaze in Glacier National Park in Montana, where afternoon
temperatures climbed into the 70s but winds stayed relatively calm.
Army reinforcements began arriving Wednesday for a final assault on
the giant Canyon Creek fire in west-central Montana.
   Fires also continued in several other Western states, including
Washington, where firefighters Wednesday took advantage of calm
weather to dig more lines around a blaze in Olympic National Park.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel confirmed Wednesday that the
forest service's widely criticized policy of letting naturally
caused fires burn was being revised. The fires resulting from the
drought of 1988, which have charred more than 4 million acres, show
that the policy ``just doesn't make sense,'' he said in a
television interview.
   About 30,000 firefighters continued to battle 32 fires in eight
Western states, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   In northern California, officials of the state forestry
department said they were making plans to start sending
firefighters back to their home stations, although the first
significant pullout probably wouldn't take place until Thursday.
   The sudden brushfire that destroyed nearly 100 homes Sunday and
Monday ebbed almost as rapidly as it had spread, and all but a few
of an estimated 8,000 people who had been evacuated at one time or
another had returned home by Wednesday.
   ``The top priority today is to pick up all the remaining hot
spots that are left. We want to be wind-proof,'' fire operations
chief Ed Waggoner said, noting that stiffer winds are expected
again in the Sierras beginning Friday.
   At Yellowstone, low overnight temperatures forced humidity up to
almost 100 percent at times, Bungarz said Wednesday morning.
   ``The weather has really knocked this down,'' he said. ``So
unless the weather changes drastically, we're definitely in the
mop-up stage.''
   Although forecasts called for warmer, drier weather, the high
winds that last week allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres
each day were not expected.
   But Bungarz stressed that the fires have surprised firefighters
in the past. He would not call the blazes controlled or contained.
   ``This is ... tricky,'' he said.
   All the fires in the park have burned into one another, Bungarz
said, in essence creating one fire stretching from the park's
southern end to its northeastern corner.
   In all, fires in the greater Yellowstone area covered about 1.5
million acres, including land in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Montana,
and have cost more than $100 million to fight.
   With clouds that have covered the park since Sunday breaking up
Wednesday morning, fire officials prepared for warmer weather that
would let them see how well fire lines that have been built Sunday
would hold up, said park spokesman Steve Iobst.
   ``As long as things don't get crazy here again, a lot of
progress can be made by people on the ground,'' he said.
   In the Bridger-Teton National Forest southeast of the park,
officials said firefighters had contained 90 percent of the
225,500-acre Huck-Mink fire complex and estimated they would
control the 38,500-acre Fayette fire by Friday.
   Ed Christian, Grand Teton National Park assistant chief ranger,
said officials have started releasing firefighters from both fires.
