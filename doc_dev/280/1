<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Has Cancerous Tumor Removed</HEAD>

   Former first lady Nancy Reagan today had
a small cancerous tumor removed from just beneath her left nostril,
a family spokesman said.
   The basal cell carcinoma was discovered during a routine
dermatological examination at the Mayo Clinic and was removed by a
plastic surgeon at St. Marys Hospital, said Mark Weinberg,
spokesman for Mrs. Reagan and former President Reagan.
   In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital removed Mrs.
Reagan's left breast and adjoining lymph glands after a cancerous
tumor was found.
   The Reagans arrived at the Mayo clinic on Monday for what
Weinberg said were routine physical examinations as part of their
annual checkups.
   Physicians found the Reagans in otherwise excellent health and
they planned to return home to Bel-Air, Calif., today, Weinberg
said.
   Weinberg issued a statement on Mrs. Reagan's condition and did
not return a phone call seeking further information. A Mayo Clinic
spokeswoman said all information would have to come from Weinberg.
   The Reagans were scheduled to visit Germany, Poland and the
Soviet Union on a trip beginning Sept. 10, Weinberg said Tuesday.
It was not known if Mrs. Reagan's surgery would affect that
schedule.
   Reagan, 79, was at the Mayo Clinic last September, when doctors
performed neurosurgery to remove a pool of blood that formed on his
brain after a fall from a horse.
