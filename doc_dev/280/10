   President Reagan and his wife Nancy will
undergo annual physical examinations and routine post-cancer-surgery
tests at Bethesda Naval Medical Center on Friday, the White House
announced Thursday.
   Col. John Hutton, the presidential physician, said in a statement
that neither has shown any recurrence of cancer.
   Reagan, who turns 78 in February, had a two-inch cancerous polyp
removed from his colon in July 1985.
   The 67-year-old first lady had her left breast removed in October
1987 after a cancerous tumor was detected.
   Hutton said the couple's exams are scheduled to begin around 1:15
p.m. EST and conclude around 5 p.m. EST. They are slated to travel
from the Maryland hospital to their weekend retreat at Camp David,
Md., afterward.
   Hutton's statement also included a plug for the importance of
such routine examinations.
   ``The first lady continues to emphasize the importance of
mammography (breast X-ray) for early detection of cancer of the
breast. The mammogram remains the most essential diagnostic test for
early detection of a malignancy. Both the president and the first
lady have remained completely asymptomatic, with no clinical
suggestion of recurrance,'' Hutton said.
   The president faces a wider battery of exams than his wife.
   Hutton's statement said Reagan will have a colonoscopy, a chest
X-ray, a CAT scan, a cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function
evaluation.
   The first lady will have her second mammogram since undergoing
the surgery, a modified radical mastectomy.
   Physicans involved in the evaluation will include Hutton and a
colleague in the White House medical unit, Dr. Martin Bacon; Dr.
Bruce Lloyd, a cardiologist; Dr. Thomas Walsh, a specialist in
pulmonary disease; Dr. David Hartman, a radiologist; Dr. Rocco
Volpe, a specialist in gastroenterology; and Dr. Elsworth Weatherby,
a specialist in nuclear medicine. All on the naval hospital staff.
   Also participating will be Drs. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo
Clinic surgeon; his son, Dr. John Randolf Beahrs, who is a physician
in private practice in St. Paul, Minn.; and Drs. Robert and David
Utz of the Mayo Clinic, the statement said.
   The elder Beahrs is an old friend and associate of Mrs. Reagan's
stepfather, the late Dr. Loyal Davis of Chicago.
   In the president's initial cancer surgery, doctors removed the
two-inch cancerous polyp and nearly two feet of colon, as well as
the surrounding tissue.
   Since 1985 and up until last January, Reagan has undergone a
colonoscopy every six months to check for any recurrence of cancer.
In that procedure, a long, flexible instrument that uses fiber-optic
technology is inserted in the large intestine to allow doctors to
see inside the bowel.
   Each time, doctors found polyps _ or small, fleshy growths _ and
removed them. In each procedure, the polyps were found to be
non-cancerous.
   The growths generally cause no serious symptoms but, if left
alone, can grow into cancerous lesions such as the one removed in
1985.
   No polyps were found in Reagan's last colonoscopy, conducted last
January, and he did not have such a checkup at the usual six-month
point over the summer.
   In January 1987, Reagan underwent successful prostate surgery to
relieve what a spokesman called a ``mild, recurring discomfort,''
apparently due to an enlarged prostate gland.
