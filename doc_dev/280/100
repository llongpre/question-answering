<HEAD>Court Restores Oregon Surgeon's Antitrust Award Against Fellow
Doctors</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court, in a ruling it acknowledged
could make doctors reluctant to serve on ``peer review'' panels,
today restored an Astoria, Ore., surgeon's $2.2 million antitrust
award against fellow doctors in his city.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices said a federal appeals court
wrongly wiped out Dr. Timothy A. Patrick's victory.
   Patrick sued partners of The Astoria Clinic in 1981, alleging
that they conspired to revoke his staff privileges at the city's
only hospital because they resented his opening a private practice
in competition against the clinic.
   A federal jury awarded Patrick $1.95 million against the clinic
and three of its physician partners. The presiding judge ordered
the people Patrick sued to pay his lawyers $228,000.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the
ruling.
   The appeals court ruled that because Oregon law required doctors
at Astoria's only hospital, Columbia Memorial, to maintain peer
review of staff physicans, their actions taken against Patrick
represented the kind of governmental action immune from federal
antitrust law.
   Invoking what lawyers call the ``state action'' doctrine, the
appeals court threw out Patrick's victory.
   But writing for the high court, Justice Thurgood Marshall said
the ``state action'' doctrine does not apply in Oregon because no
state official reviews the doctors' peer-review decisions.
   ``Because we conclude that no state actor in Oregon actively
supervises hospital peer-review decisions, we hold that the state
action doctrine does not protect the peer-review activities
challenged in this case,'' Marshall said.
   He said the justices ``are not unmindful of the policy argument
that ... effective peer review is essential to the provision of
quality medical care and that any threat of antitrust liability
will prevent physicians from participating openly and actively in
peer-review proceedings.''
   But Marshall said Congress, not the high court, must take care
of that.
   In the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, Congress
insulated certain medical peer-review activities from antitrust
liability.
   Under the law, action by such medical panels escapes liability
if it was taken ``in the reasonable belief that it was in the
furtherance of quality health care.''
   But the law does not appear to immunize all peer-review actions
from antitrust liability, and it is not retroactive to Patrick's
lawsuit.
   ``If phsyicians believe that the act provides insufficient
immunity to protect the peer-review process fully, they must take
up that matter with Congress,'' Marshall said.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who once served as general counsel to
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disqualified himself from the
case, Patrick vs. Burget, 86-1145.
