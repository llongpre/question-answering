   Recovering rapidly from surgery to remove
fluid from the surface of his brain, former President Ronald Reagan
on Saturday joked with visitors and read several newspapers, his
spokesman said.
   ``He is in excellent spirits, telling baseball stories and joking
with his staff,'' Reagan's spokesman Mark Weinberg said.
   In reference to the removal of at least some of his hair for the
surgery, Reagan quipped, ``I guess my barber can have the week
off,'' Weinberg said.
   Shortly after awaking at 6:30 a.m. Saturday, Reagan underwent a
follow-up CAT scan to view the upper right portion of his head where
surgeons on Friday drilled a hole in his skull to remove a buildup
of blood. Weinberg said the problem stemmed from a July 4 incident
in which Reagan fell from a ``wildly'' bucking horse. It was
detected on a routine physical examination.
   The ``evacuation'' of the puddle of blood had progressed
``exactly as had been anticipated'' as of Saturday morning and
doctors removed the drain that had been placed on his skull at the
time of surgery, Weinberg said.
   Friday's hour-long operation was led by Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt,
chairman of the Mayo Clinic's department of neurologic surgery.
Sundt, editor of a leading medical journal on neurology, was
assisted by two neurologic surgeons, three nurses and an
anesthesiologist at the clinic, located about 70 miles southeast of
Minneapolis.
   Reagan's postoperative recovery room is located in an otherwise
unoccupied section of St. Marys Hospital which was under security
guard. Nancy Reagan spent the night in a room across the hall from
her husband and will remain at the hospital ``at least for the time
being,'' Weinberg said.
   He would not say when Reagan is expected to be released and Sundt
would not comment about any aspect of Reagan's care.
   Weinberg said Reagan spent part of Friday night watching the
Minnesota Twins play the Kansas City Royals on television. He ate a
breakfast Saturday of bran cereal, whole wheat toast, orange juice
and decaffeinated coffee and will continue to be able to choose his
own diet, Weinberg said.
   ``President Reagan read several newspapers and visited with Mrs.
Reagan and members of their staff,'' Weinberg said. ``President
Reagan will spend the rest of the day reading and resting.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said President Bush called
Reagan about 6 p.m. EDT and the call lasted about five minutes.
   ``The president wished him well.'' said Popadiuk. ``President
Reagan sounded strong and very well. He said he had no pain. He
stated that he hopes to get out soon and expressed his appreciation
for the flowers the president and Mrs. Bush had sent.''
   Among the others sending messages to Reagan were Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain, the Rev. Billy Graham, Henry
Kissinger and former presidents Ford and Nixon, Weinberg said.
   Also Saturday, delegates to a state Republican convention in
Mankato, Minn., received an unexpected call from Reagan.
   ``I'm being handsomely treated here in your state, and it's a
pleasure to be here,'' Reagan said. ``I'm going to be out on the
mashed potato circuit as much as I can.''
   A hospital employee who asked not to be identified said only a
mild pain killer was prescribed for Reagan. Weinberg said he did not
know if Reagan was taking any pain-killers.
   ``He looks great, he feels great, his spirits are terrific,''
Weinberg said ``No further treatment is now anticipated.''
   Several doctors not involved in the surgery or connected to the
Mayo Clinic said the type of surgery Reagan underwent was common.
They say the recovery period usually includes up to a week of
hospitalization.
   Weinberg said he does not know if the recovery period will limit
the former president's activities.
