   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, entered
Bethesda Naval Hospital today for physical exams and
post-cancer-surgery tests to see if they have remained free of any
malignancy.
   Both Reagans called out ``fine'' when reporters asked about their
well-being as they entered Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban
Maryland.
   Reagan, wearing bright blue running shoes, said he was ``going to
be on a tread mill'' as part of his battery of exams and therefore
had donned the footwear.
   Due to a light snowfall dusting the nation's capital, the
president and his wife dropped plans to fly by helicopter and
instead traveled by motorcade from the White House to the hospital.
   The president was to undergo a range of tests, including his
sixth colonoscopy, or examination of the intestine. The first lady
was scheduled to have her second post-surgery breast X-ray.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he did not expect a
report from the president's physicians until early in the evening.
The Reagans were slated to leave the hosptal for Camp David, Md.,
around 5 p.m. EST.
   Earlier in the day, the spokesman said Reagan has gotten a
positive report from his dermatologists, who examined him on
Thursday and pronounced him free of any new skin cancers.
   Reagan had skin cancers removed from his face in August of 1985
and again in June of 1986.
   Fitzwater said three physicians, including Capt. Theodore
Parlette, the chief of dermatology at the Bethesda Naval Hospital,
conducted a visual examination of Reagan's skin on Thursday and they
``did not detect a change'' in his condition.
   Col. John Hutton, the presidential physician, said in a statement
released Thursday that neither the president nor the first lady has
shown any ``clinical suggestion of recurrence'' of cancer.
   ``Both the president and the first lady have remained completely
asymtomatic,'' Hutton said.
   Reagan, who turns 78 in February, had a two-inch cancerous polyp
removed from his colon in July 1985.
   The 67-year-old first lady had her left breast removed in October
1987 after a cancerous tumor was detected.
   Hutton's statement also included a plug for the importance of
such routine examinations.
   ``The first lady continues to emphasize the importance of
mammography (breast X-ray) for early detection of cancer of the
breast. The mammogram remains the most essential diagnostic test for
early detection of a malignancy,'' he said.
   Hutton's statement said Reagan will have a colonoscopy, a chest
X-ray, a CAT scan, a cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function
evaluation.
   The first lady will have her second mammogram since undergoing
the surgery, an operation known as a modified radical mastectomy, in
which the entire breast is removed, along with some lymph nodes.
   Physicians involved in the evaluation will include Hutton and a
colleague in the White House medical unit, Dr. Martin Bacon; Dr.
Bruce Lloyd, a cardiologist; Dr. Thomas Walsh, a specialist in
pulmonary disease; Dr. David Hartman, a radiologist; Dr. Rocco
Volpe, a specialist in gastroenterology; and Dr. Elsworth Weatherby,
a specialist in nuclear medicine. All are on the naval hospital
staff.
   Also participating will be Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo
Clinic surgeon; his son, Dr. John Randolf Beahrs, who is a physician
in private practice in St. Paul, Minn.; Dr. Robert Beart and Dr.
David Utz of the Mayo Clinic, the statement said.
   The elder Beahrs is an old friend and associate of Mrs. Reagan's
stepfather, the late Dr. Loyal Davis of Chicago.
   In the president's initial cancer surgery, doctors removed the
two-inch cancerous polyp and nearly two feet of colon, as well as
the surrounding tissue.
   Since the 1985 surgery, Reagan has undergone five colonoscopies
to check for any recurrence of cancer. In that procedure, a long,
flexible instrument that uses fiber-optic technology is inserted in
the large intestine to allow doctors to see inside the bowel.
   Each time, except for the last such test in anuary, doctors found
small, fleshy growths known as polyps and removed them. In each
procedure, the polyps were found to be noncancerous.
   The growths generally cause no serious symptoms but, if left
alone, can grow into cancerous lesions.
