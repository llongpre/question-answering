   Former President Reagan left the hospital
for his home in Los Angeles today, tipping his hat to well-wishers
and revealing a shaved spot on his head where Mayo Clinic physicians
performed skull surgery a week ago.
   Reagan, 78, and his wife, Nancy, boarded a privately owned DC-9
jet, which took off shortly after 10 a.m.
   About 100 people, many of them travelers at the Rochester
airport, gathered as the Rochester Lourdes High School marching band
played while Reagan said good-bye to Mayo Clinic officials and to
retired Mayo physician, Dr. Oliver Beahrs.
   Beahrs, a friend of Mrs. Reagan's late father, who also was a
physician, said Reagan was returning home in good health.
   ``I'm just very happy for him and for her,'' he said. ``Any
operation is a serious one, but this was fairly simple and he came
through it very well.''
   Scott Patterson, pilot of the DC-9, said the weather from
Rochester in southeastern Minnesota to Los Angeles looked clear for
the 3{-hour flight. He said the plane belonged to a friend of the
Reagans', whose name he would not disclose.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said Thursday that the Reagans
would go directly to their home in Los Angeles after the flight.
   Weinberg also said Thursday that doctors were ``completely
satisfied'' with Reagan's recovery. The former president had been
recuperating at St. Marys Hospital since doctors on Sept. 8 drained
fluid that had built up on his brain after he was thrown from a
horse on July 4.
   On Thursday, Reagan met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who
was in the state to give a speech, and Soviet parliament member
Boris Yeltsin.
   ``It seemed as if he feels pretty good,'' Yeltsin said after the
20-minute meeting. ``We've never had a personal meeting before.''
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin was in Minneapolis for a private dinner
Wednesday with business leaders. He said he squeezed the Reagan
visit into his week-long tour of the United States ``simply as a
sign of respect for him and an opportunity to wish him a rapid
recovery.''
   Yeltsin brought Reagan a bouquet of red roses and, according to
Weinberg, told him: ``You gave the start to the very perceptible
warming of relations between the two countries. Your contribution to
this was enormous. You were very wise, courageous and tactful in the
way you went about it. I am very grateful to you for this.''
   Dumped as Communist Party chief in Moscow in 1987 after
criticizing some of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policies,
Yeltsin was overwhelmingly elected to parliament this year, running
as an outsider. He has been urging Gorbachev to quicken the pace of
reform in the Soviet Union.
   Yeltsin said he hadn't requested Reagan's help in his push for
Soviet economic change. ``I thought that would have been a little
tactless, since he's in the hospital,'' he said.
