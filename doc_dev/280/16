   The Rev. Billy Graham has been released
from a hospital following surgery in which part of a rib was
removed to check for cancer, the Mayo Clinic said Tuesday. No
cancer was found.
   Graham was released Monday from St. Marys Hospital and will
continue as an outpatient at the Mayo Clinic for the next week or
two, the clinic said.
   Graham, 71, entered the Mayo Foundation hospital April 10 after
clinic doctors observed a rib lesion on X-rays taken several weeks
after he fell. Graham had complained of persistent pain in his left
rib cage and upper back. Surgery was performed April 11 to remove
part of the rib and check it for cancer.
   ``It is felt that the lesion was related to the fall, that he
had fractured a rib and that was part of the healing process,''
Mayo Clinic spokeswoman Nancy Skaran said Tuesday.
   Graham's doctors have recommended he limit his schedule for an
undetermined length of time, saying he needs complete rest,
followed by gradual exercise.
   ``He was already physically weakened prior to surgery as a
result of an exhaustive schedule which included two recent trips to
Berlin,'' the clinic said in a statement.
   ``Mr. Graham is deeply grateful for the many letters, telegrams,
cards and flowers he has received,'' the statement added.
