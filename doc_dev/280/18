   The chief surgeon in the operation to
remove old blood from the brain of former President Reagan is an
international leader in vascular surgery and editor of a medical
journal on neurology.
   Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt of the Mayo Clinic led the one-hour surgery
Friday in which he and two neurologists assisting him drained fluid
that had collected on the top of the right side of the former
president's brain. The buildup was the result of a July 4 injury in
which Reagan was thrown from a bucking horse, said Mark Weinberg,
Reagan's spokesman.
   Weinberg said doctors considered the surgery a success, and
Reagan was conscious and resting in his hospital bed Friday night.
Reagan's condition was described by Weinberg as ``excellent and
stable.''
   Sundt said in a telephone interview he was assisted by Mayo
neurologists Michael J. Ebersold and Richard W. Marsh. Three nurses
also assisted in the operation, which ended about 5:15 p.m., Sundt
said. Ebersold said Roy Cucchiara administered general anesthesia to
the former president.
   Sundt said he and the other doctors will not comment on the
operation or the recovery stages.
   Sundt is the editor of the Journal of Neurosurgery and an expert
on the blood delivery system, Ebersold said.
   ``He would be recognized as one of the international leaders in
neurology,'' Ebersold said. ``His awards in neurosurgery are almost
too numerous to mention.''
   Sundt received his undergraduate degree from the U.S. Military
Academy in 1952 and served in the Army from 1952 to 1955. He
received his doctorate from the University of Tennessee College of
Medicine at Memphis in 1960 and interned at John Gaston Charity
Hospital in Memphis.
   Sundt entered the Mayo Graduate School for research training in
cerebrovascular diseases for one year in January 1965 and is now
Mayo's chairman of the Department of Neurologic Surgery.
   In 1984, Sundt was one of 120 doctors named by 400 peers across
the country in a Good Housekeeping magazine survey as the nation's
best physicians.
   Ebersold grew up in Alma, Wis., and received his doctorate from
the University of Wisconsin. He said his expertise is in skull-base
abnormalities, including abnormalities of the spine.
   After a residency at Mayo, Ebersold said he entered private
practice in Eau Claire, Wis., before returning to the clinic 10
years ago. He said he has worked frequently as a team with Sundt and
Marsh.
   Cucchiara received his doctorate from Louisiana State University
School of Medicine in 1969 and interned at Charity Hospital in New
Orleans. He entered Mayo Graduate School as a resident in
anesthesiology in July 1970.
