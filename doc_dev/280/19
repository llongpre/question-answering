<HEAD>Former President Returns Home After Skull Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Former President Ronald Reagan, in good
spirits after skull surgery in Minnesota, tipped his cap to
well-wishers on his way home to California and perhaps inadvertently
showed off his half-shaved head.
   His wife Nancy rubbed the shaved side of Reagan's head Friday as
he waved the Minnesota Twins baseball cap he was wearing when the
couple boarded a private jet in Rochester, Minn.
   Beaming ear-to-ear, the 78-year-old showed no other signs of the
surgery he underwent to drain fluid that built up on his brain
following injuries suffered after falling off a horse in July.
   By the time the plane landed at Van Nuys Airport about noon,
Reagan had traded the Twins cap for a University of Southern
California Trojans hat, which he kept on as he left the plane and
got into a car.
   ``He feels great and he's happy to be home,'' said Reagan
spokesman Mark Weinberg.
   The former president had been recuperating at St. Marys Hospital
since the Sept. 8 operation to treat a condition blamed on Reagan's
spill from a trail horse July 4 during a visit to a ranch in Mexico.
   Reagan is an avid horseman who rides regularly during stays at
his hilltop ranch in Santa Barbara County. After leaving the White
House, the Reagans moved into their home in the affluent suburb of
Bel-Air.
   About 100 people, many of them travelers at Rochester airport,
gathered as the Rochester Lourdes High School marching band played
while Reagan said good-bye to Mayo Clinic officials.
   Retired Mayo physician, Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a friend of Mrs.
Reagan's late father, said Reagan was in good health.
   ``I'm just very happy for him and for her,'' he said. ``Any
operation is a serious one, but this was fairly simple and he came
through it very well.''
