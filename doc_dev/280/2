<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, planned to arrive today for 
routine physical examinations at the Mayo Clinic, said Reagan spokesman Mark 
Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans have a longstanding relationship with Mayo physicians. Nancy 
Reagan's stepfather, who was a doctor, was a friend of Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a 
retired clinic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, a team of Mayo physicians examined Reagan for any recurrence 
of an earlier colon cancer and they performed surgery to correct an enlarged 
prostate. In October, 1987, two Mayo physicians were part of a team that 
treated Nancy Reagan's breast cancer.
