The horseback-riding accident that doctors believe produced the blood clot 
removed from former President Ronald Reagan's brain last Friday caused a 
similar but smaller clot last July that disappeared without surgery, Reagan's 
doctor has disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Monday's New York Times, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt, chief 
neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic and the head of the team caring for Reagan, 
said that the earlier clot had shown up in medical tests performed in Los 
Angeles several days after the accident, which occurred July 4 on a Mexican 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors watched the clot, called a subdural hematoma, in periodic brain tests 
until it disappeared spontaneously, Sundt told the New York Times. Sundt could 
not be reached Monday, but Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg confirmed the report. 
</P>
<P>
Because the clot had developed after the July head injury, Reagan's doctors at 
Mayo recommended repeating the brain test, called a CAT scan, as part of his 
routine physical examination last week to make sure the problem had not 
recurred, Weinberg said.

Reagan, 78, who is recuperating at St. Mary's Hospital, a Mayo Foundation 
hospital in Rochester, Minn., has reportedly received hundreds of cards and 
messages from well-wishers. He is continuing to make an excellent recovery from 
last week's surgery and may be able to return to California at the end of this 
week, according to a statement issued by Weinberg Monday afternoon.
