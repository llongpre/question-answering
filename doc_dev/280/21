<HEAD>Former President Continues Recovery From Surgery</HEAD>

   Former President Reagan is rapidly
recovering from surgery to remove fluid from the surface of his
brain but won't be released from St. Marys Hospital until at least
Tuesday, his spokesman said.
   Reagan will ``go home when the doctors tell him he can,''
spokesman Mark Weinberg said Sunday.
   Weinberg said he knows of no further procedures planned for
Reagan.
   The 78-year-old former president had a restful night and awoke
shortly after 6:30 a.m. Sunday, Weinberg said. After breakfast, he
read newspapers and visited with his brother-in-law Dr. Richard
Davis, then had lunch with his wife, Nancy, Weinberg said.
   Reagan also walked unassisted outside his room, watched football
on television, wrote letters, posed for a photographer while wearing
a Minnesota Twins cap and read some of the hundreds of greeting
cards he has received since entering the hospital Friday.
   ``The team of Mayo Clinic physicians and nurses managing
President Reagan's care ... report that he continues to make an
excellent recovery,'' Weinberg said.
   On Friday, surgeons drilled a hole in Reagan's skull to remove a
buildup of blood. Weinberg said the problem stemmed from a July 4
accident in which Reagan was thrown by a bucking horse and hit his
head. The fluid was detected during a routine physical examination.
   Reagan's neurosurgeon, meanwhile, said an earlier brain clot had
been detected but it had healed on its own without an operation, The
New York Times reported today.
   The neurosurgeon, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt, said Sunday the first
clot was smaller and in a different area of the brain than the one
removed Friday. Because of the first clot, brain tests were included
as part of the checkup, Sundt said.
   Reagan's spokesman had not previously disclosed the earlier blood
clot, detected in early July by doctors in Los Angeles, where Reagan
lives.
   The Reagans on Saturday sent a message of good wishes to Mother
Teresa, who was hospitalized in Calcutta, India, after suffering a
heart attack.
   President Bush telephoned Reagan on Saturday evening from Camp
David and spoke with his predecessor for about five minutes,
Weinberg said.
   ``The president wished him well,'' said White House spokesman
Roman Popadiuk. ``President Reagan sounded strong and very well. He
said he had no pain. He stated that he hopes to get out soon and
expressed his appreciation for the flowers the president and Mrs.
Bush sent.''
   Many others also have sent flowers, Weinberg said, including the
king of Morocco and the White House executive residence staff.
   Because of the limited space in Reagan's room, Weinberg said the
flowers were being shared with other patients.
