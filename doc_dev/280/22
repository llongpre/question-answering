   Actress Rachel Ward retreated to Australia
after the film ``Against All Odds'' and produced two children,
giving her the most demanding role of her life.
   ``There isn't much time for anything other than raising them, is
there? That just about takes up all of your time, if you're doing
it properly,'' Miss Ward said on a promotion tour for her new movie
``After Dark, My Sweet.''
   She said 5-year-old Rosie and 3-year-old Matilda are a handful,
but the high-profile life of a celebrity doesn't appeal to her.
   ``I didn't really feel that that was particularly rewarding,''
she said. ``If you do that you have a chance to be in a lot of
movies and stuff. But just being in the movies ultimately isn't
enough.''
   Last year, she portrayed an overly materialistic wife in ``How
to Get Ahead in Advertising.''

   Former President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, have returned to Minnesota to undergo routine physical
examinations at the Mayo Clinic, where he underwent skull surgery a
year earlier.
   The Reagans arrived at the Rochester airport Monday afternoon on
a private plane. Reagan waved to a small group of people gathered
at the airport, then police led them to their hotel in a motorcade.
   Asked how he thought President Bush was handling the Persian
Gulf situation, Reagan said: ``Fine.''
   Reagan, 79, lives in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles.
   ``Both President and Mrs. Reagan are feeling fine, and these
examinations have been on their calendar for several months,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in a statement.
   Reagan was at the Mayo Clinic a year ago for surgery to remove a
pool of blood that formed on his brain after a fall from a horse.
The surgery was performed Sept. 8 and Reagan left Rochester Sept.
15.

   Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the
world's first successful liver transplant, was released from the
hospital Tuesday, four days after undergoing heart surgery.
   Starzl, 64, underwent a coronary artery bypass operation Friday
at Presbyterian University Hospital, where he has performed
hundreds of transplant operations.
   ``He's doing very well,'' said Dr. Bruce Wilson, Starzl's
cardiologist. ``He walked up and down the halls yesterday.''
   Wilson said Starzl probably would rest at home for a couple of
weeks before returning to work.
   In 1967 at the University of Colorado, Starzl performed the
first successful liver transplant. In 1981, Starzl began work at
Presbyterian University Hospital, which he helped make one of the
world's premier transplant centers. Last year, the hospital
performed more than 460 liver transplants and 210 kidney
transplants.

   Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, whose film
``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams'' opened in New York last week to
excellent reviews, is at work on his next project, ``Rhapsody in
August.''
   The film, to be shot on location throughout Japan, tells the
story of a family's reconciliation with Japanese-American relatives
who have been long out of contact. It is scheduled for release next
summer.
   ``Rhapsody in August'' will feature the 85-year-old Japanese
actress Sachiko Murase and will also have American star Richard
Gere in a supporting role. Director Martin Scorsese appears as
Vincent van Gogh in ``Dreams,'' the 80-year-old Kurosawa's first
film in five years.
   Kurosawa's other movies include ``Seven Sumarai,'' ``Ran'' and
``Rashomon,'' which won the Academy Award for best foreign film in
1951.

   Legendary bluesman John Lee Hooker, who has
released more than 100 albums in his 60-year career, is the honored
guest at an Oct. 16 all-star benefit concert to benefit the Delta
Blues Museum.
   Hooker will play with an assortment of his contemporaries and
current performers, including Willie Dixon, Bo Diddley, Greg
Allman, Al Kooper and Albert Collins. The show is set for Madison
Square Garden.
   ``If you're feeling low, the blues pick you up like a spirit,''
Hooker said in explaining his longtime appeal. ``The blues are hot.
They're being appreciated the way they should have been appreciated
a long time ago.''
   Hooker, 71, was born in Clarksdale, Miss., which is now the home
to the Delta Blues Museum.
