   Joy Baker, the wife of former White
House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, has checked into the Mayo
Clinic, said a hospital spokesman.
   ``She is a patient at Mayo, but because of our policy of patient
confidentiality we won't release any more information,'' said Mary
Ellen Landwehr, clinic spokeswoman.
   On July 1, Howard Baker stepped down as chief of staff and said
he would return to his home in East Tennessee where his wife and
stepmother were in poor health.
   Mrs. Baker, 59, the daughter of former Senate Minority Leader
Everett Dirksen, entered the clinic Wednesday, said Ms. Landwehr.
   She was discharged earlier Wednesday from St. Mary's Medical
Center in Knoxville, Tenn., where she was treated since June 9 for
chronic back problems.
   Mrs. Baker has been treated previously at the Mayo Clinic for
that ailment.
   Two years ago she had surgery on a non-malignant intestinal
obstruction, and in 1982 she had a tumor removed from her right
lung.
