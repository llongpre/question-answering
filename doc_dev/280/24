<HEAD>6-Foot, 7-Year-Old Soviet Boy Undergoes Pituitary Tumor Surgery</HEAD>

   Surgery to stop the rapid growth of a
7-year-old Soviet boy who stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds
appears to have gone well, but surgeons say he may need more
treatment.
   In a three-hour operation Tuesday at the Mayo Clinic's St. Marys
Hospital, doctors removed all that was apparent of a large tumor on
Igor Ladan's pituitary gland.
   But surgeons said some cells of the tumor, which had resulted in
an overproduction of growth hormone, may remain, and additional
medication or radiation therapy may be needed to lessen the
likelihood that the tumor will grow back.
   Igor came to the clinic with his mother, Svitlana Ladan, in
September from their home in the Ukrainian city of Kiev following a
worldwide search for doctors who could treat the rare tumor.
   The tumor had risen up out of the pituitary gland and was
pressing on the brain, the clinic said in a statement.
   Doctors first used drug therapy to reduce the tumor by about 30
percent, then decided to operate when tests showed no further
reduction in the tumor's size, said Dr. Donald Zimmerman, a
pediatric endocrinologist who is part of the team treating the boy.
   Some of the possible complications from the surgery include
serious bleeding, blindness or vision loss and stroke, the clinic
said.
   ``Tumors similar in size to Igor's tend to grow around arteries
and vital structures of the pituitary making complete removal of
the tumor difficult or impossible,'' the clinic said.
   Mayo Clinic physicians have treated more than 60 children with
pituitary tumors.
