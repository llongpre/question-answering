   Former President Reagan, recovering from
skull surgery, should be able to return home in a few days and in
the meantime is working on paperwork and keeping up with the news, a
spokesman said.
   ``Physicians managing President Reagan's care are hopeful that if
the present rate of progress continues, President Reagan will be
able to return to California at the end of the week,'' Reagan
spokesman Mark Weinberg said Monday.
   He said no specific date has been set for Reagan, 78, to be
released from the Mayo Clinic's St. Marys Hospital.
   Mayo doctors Friday drilled a hole in the former president's
skull to remove a buildup of blood. Weinberg said the problem
stemmed from a July 4 accident in which Reagan was thrown from a
horse and hit his head.
   On Monday morning, Reagan read newspapers, watched morning
television news programs and did routine paperwork, Weinberg said.
   Later, Reagan spoke with Gen. Colin Powell, chairman-designate of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had telephoned over the weekend to
extend his good wishes, Weinberg said.
   Reagan has spoken several times by phone with his son Ron, and
has been looking through the hundreds of cards and messages he has
received, Weinberg said.
   An earlier blood clot was detected in Reagan's brain this summer
but it had healed on its own without an operation, Weinberg
confirmed Monday.
   Neurosurgeon Thoralf M. Sundt has said that the first clot was
smaller and in a different area of the brain. Because of the first
clot, brain tests were included as part of the checkup, Sundt said.
   Reagan's spokesman had not previously disclosed the earlier blood
clot, detected shortly after the horse-riding accident by doctors in
Los Angeles, where Reagan lives.
