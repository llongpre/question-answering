   Your Jan. 9 page-one article "Radical Gambit: Some Healthy
Women Undergo Mastectomies to Avert Breast Cancer" indicated
that prophylactic mastectomies are carried out at the Mayo
Clinic but are not tracked separately from those patients who
undergo surgery for cancer of the breasts. This is incorrect.
Every effort is made to track these patients, and we
recommend that they return or be checked on a yearly basis.
   We recently have completed a survey of subcutaneous
mastectomy patients. More than 1,700 subcutaneous
mastectomies have been performed at the Mayo Clinic in the
past 29 years. Many of these patients were at prohibitively
high risk for cancer like some of the patients quoted in your
article. Though our follow-up is incomplete because the
majority of our patients are from a long distance away and
are sometimes hard to track, only six patients have developed
cancer, and all are alive without evidence of cancer at
present. This is despite the high risk in many and the fact
that a small amount of breast tissue is left during this
procedure.

   At this institution we make a distinction between
prophylactic mastectomy and mastectomy for risk reduction.
Prophylactic mastectomy is a simple mastectomy that removes
essentially all breast tissue and theoretically reduces the
risk of cancer to zero. Subcutaneous mastectomy, or
risk-reducing mastectomy, leaves a small amount of breast
tissue, in our experience about 5%, and leaves the patient at
a small risk for cancer. That risk is indeed small, probably
less than 1%, though the data are not hard. In addition, the
small amount of breast tissue that remains is where it can be
examined very easily by patient and physician. At the time of
subcutaneous mastectomy, breast reconstruction is carried
out. In the overwhelming majority of patients a satisfactory
result can be achieved with soft breasts, reasonable symmetry
and appearance that with a brassiere on is essentially
normal. Many patients may look better than they did before.
   We are interested in Dr. Susan Love's statement that
having a body part removed preventively is "really crazy." It
is from women who literally live in terror of breast cancer
because of high risk that the impetus for the procedure
comes. We can testify that this procedure is performed
largely at the urgent request of patients, oncologists or
surgeons who are frustrated with the constant threat of
further biopsies or cancer. The majority of our patients are
gratified and grateful for the opportunity to return to
normal life without living with the constant threat of
cancer. We continue to carry out both simple (prophylactic)
mastectomy and subcutaneous mastectomy for patients who are
at high risk for breast cancer on the basis of the patient
and the oncologist's perception that this is appropriate. The
patients are the strongest advocates of this surgery.
