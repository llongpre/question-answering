   Cristina Ferrare says she worked so hard during
her last pregnancy that she could ``hardly wait to go into labor so
I could rest.''
   Ms. Ferrare was working as a host of three television shows
while pregnant with her fourth child, her second daughter with
entertainment executive Tony Thomopoulos. She had two children with
her ex-husband, automaker John DeLorean.
   ``I could hardly wait to go into labor so I could rest,'' she
said in an interview in the September issue of Good Housekeeping
magazine. ``A month after the baby arrived, I went back to work and
discovered I was simply burnt out.''
   One of her three shows, ``Incredible Sunday,'' was canceled and
she decided to leave the other two, ``A.M. Los Angeles'' and the
``Home Show.''

   Metropolitan Opera star Jessye Norman and
violinist Isaac Stern will pay homage this weekend to Marian
Anderson, the black contralto who once was banned from performing
in Washington.
   Fifty years ago, the Daughters of the American Revolution
refused to let Anderson sing at Washington's Constitution Hall and
first lady Eleanor Roosevelt resigned from the organization in
protest.
   Within days, Anderson was invited to sing on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial and her concert attracted a racially mixed
audience of 75,000.
   Anderson went on to become the first black singer to perform in
a leading role at the Metropolitan Opera. She sang at the
inaugurations of Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy and before kings
and queens.
   On Saturday, Anderson, 87, will be in the audience as Norman,
Stern, conductor Julius Rudel and the Ives Symphony Orchestra
perform for her.
   Besides being a musical tribute, the evening will benefit the
Marian Anderson Award, established to promote the careers of
promising young singers.
   Anderson lives in Danbury on a 100-acre farm that she and her
late husband, architect Orpheus H. Fisher, bought more than 45
years ago.

   Soul singer Aretha Franklin is offering to sing
in a benefit in a last-ditch effort to restore music programs in
Motown's public schools.
   ``They are already working on it,'' said Franklin's publicist
Tuesday.
   Superintendent John Porter said Franklin offered to do a benefit
to help raise $1.25 million for Detroit's middle and elementary
schools' instrumental music programs.
   The classes were eliminated in June when the deficit-riddled
school board approved $50 million in cuts to balance its budget.
School officials earlier set a Monday deadline to raise the money
but extended the date until Aug. 21.
   A tax increase goes before voters Sept. 12. It would restore
music to the schools, Porter said. If approved, any additional
money raised would be added to the music curriculum.
   Businessman and former Detroit Piston Dave Bing also is leading
an effort to raise funds to restore sports programs, which were
eliminated in the budget cuts. He already has committed $600,000.

   Chuck D., the leader of the rap group Public
Enemy, says the band has reunited after firing one member for his
anti-Semitic remarks and is ready to fight the power in an upcoming
album.
   ``After having taken time out for reorganization, Public Enemy
is back in action,'' Chuck D. said in a statement Wednesday. ``The
show must go on. Brace yourselves for 1990.''
   The group announced at the end of June that it was taking a
break after firing its ``minister of information,'' Professor
Griff, for anti-Semitic remarks made in a newspaper interview.
   Public Enemy's follow-up to their smash album ``It Takes a
Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back'' will be titled ``Fear of a
Black Planet.'' Their current single, ``Fight the Power,'' is on
the soundtrack of the Spike Lee film ``Do The Right Thing.''
   ``We're still pro-black, pro-black culture and pro-human race.
Please direct any further questions to (Guns N' Roses vocalist) Axl
Rose,'' said Chuck D.

   Former President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, will have their annual physicals at the Mayo Clinic later
this year, said a Reagan spokesman.
   Mark Weinberg, however, declined to specify when Reagan, 78, and
his 68-year-old wife would arrive at the famed hospital.
   The Reagans, who live in Bel-Air, Calif., have a long
relationship with Mayo physicians, stemming in part from a
friendship between Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo Clinic
surgeon, and Mrs. Reagan's late stepfather, Dr. Loyal Davis.
