   Trials of the first 30 hip replacement
devices designed at the Mayo Clinic show they are less painful to
their recipients and less likely to fail than today's standard
devices, a Mayo physician says.
   The new design is ``dramatically different'' from other implant
devices on the market, said Dr. Bernard Morrey, professor and
chairman of Mayo's Department of Orthopedics.
   Primarily, it is shorter than traditional devices and the
double-wedged, tapered design allows it to be affixed to the bone
without cement. It is less invasive and less of the patient's bone
must be removed to implant it _ important factors in case the
device must be replaced, he said.
   Mayo Clinic has performed about 20,000 hip replacements in the
last 20 years. In recent years, however, about one-third have been
second-time replacements because an earlier device failed.
   Morrey, a specialist in adult reconstructive surgery, has been
the only surgeon using the new device. Other Mayo physicians will
begin implanting it and if it proves successful, the device could
be widely available in about a year if the results continue to
prove successful.
   A Mayo team began designing the device in the early 1980s
because of the need for an implant that could be affixed to the
bone without relying on cement.
   Although cemented implants are successful with older patients,
they tend to crack and fail in more active people. When the cement
cracks, the implant loosens and the surgery must be redone.
   Initially, specialists thought an implant would need to be
large, with a large surface area, to be affixed without cement,
Morrey said.
   But there was concern the body would produce an adverse
biological or biomechanical response, he said. In fact, early
evidence suggested that bones could dissolve because the stress
they needed to be viable was taken by the implant instead.
   Mayo Clinic specialists designed the short-stem implant with a
working part of about three inches, about half the length of the
traditional device. Because of its shorter length, the bone
receives the stress it needs to avoid dissolving.
   The shorter length could explain why people don't have the thigh
pain that affects about one in 10 people with non-cemented
implants, Morrey said. Although the pain usually subsides in a
year, it can compromise the success of implants that otherwise look
perfect.
   The implement was designed to be easy to manufacture in hopes of
keeping costs down, Morrey said. The same implant can be used in
the right hip or the left hip so medical facilities can keep their
inventory low.
