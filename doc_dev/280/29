   Former President Ronald Reagan received a
surprise hospital visit Tuesday from his daughter, Maureen, as he
continued recovering from surgery to drain fluid from the surface of
his brain.
   Maureen Reagan had lunch with her father and his wife, Nancy, and
was arranging a special dinner for Reagan Tuesday night in Reagan's
hospital room, said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg.
   Weinberg said he knew of no other relatives who planned to visit
Reagan in Rochester.
   Reagan, 78, underwent the skull surgery Friday at St. Marys
Hospital and his recovery is progressing as expected, Weinberg said.
   ``We're still hopeful, if the present rate of progress continues,
he will be able to return to California by the end of the week,''
Weinberg said. ``There are no plans at this point for any additional
surgery.''
   Reagan followed his normal morning routine Tuesday, reading
several newspapers and newsmagazines and watching television news
programs, Weinberg said. Reagan also been going through the many
cards, letters and telegrams that well-wishers have sent, including
messages from entertainer Bob Hope, actress Claudette Colbert and
actor Jimmy Stewart, Weinberg said.
   Weinberg also said Reagan would be canceling a 10-day trip
scheduled later this month to New York, Ohio, Virginia, New Jersey,
Massachusetts and Arizona.
   Surgeons drilled a hole in Reagan's skull to remove a buildup of
blood caused by a July 4 fall from a bucking horse.
   The fluid was detected during a routine examination last week by
Mayo Clinic doctors. Reagan's neurosurgeon said an earlier brain
clot had been detected but it had healed on its own.
