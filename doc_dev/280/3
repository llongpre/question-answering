   Former President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, arrived for routine physicals at the Mayo Clinic.
   The Reagans were to undergo the examinations today before
returning to their Bel Air, Calif., home, said their spokesman, Mark
Weinberg, who accompanied the couple.
   As the Reagans' motorcade from the airport pulled up at the
Kahler Hotel on Wednesday, about 100 onlookers applauded. Reagan
waved as he got out of his car and entered the hotel.
   Asked by a reporter what he thought of the drug plan President
Bush outlined Tuesday night, Reagan said, ``It's fine. It's high
time.''
   The former president, who also was applauded by a crowd in the
hotel lobby and shook hands with a number of people, appeared to be
in good health.
   The Reagans have a long relationship with physicians at the
clinic in this city 70 miles southeast of Minneapolis. Mrs. Reagan's
doctor stepfather was a friend of Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo
surgeon.
   A team of Mayo physicians examined Reagan in January 1987 for any
recurrence of an earlier colon cancer, and performed surgery to
correct an enlarged prostate.
   In October 1987, two Mayo physicians were part of a team that
treated Mrs. Reagan's breast cancer.
   Reagan ``looks very healthy,'' said Leonard Harms of Reidsburg,
Wis., a hotel guest visiting the clinic who ran for his camera when
he heard the Reagans were coming. ``I got lots of pictures and a
picture of her.''
