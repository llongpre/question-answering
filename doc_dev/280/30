   The surgery that removed a small puddle of old
blood from the brain cavity of former President Reagan was among the
simplest of the procedures that could have been used according to
surgeons familiar with brain operations.
   A spokesman for the former president said doctors at St. Marys
Hospital removed a subdural hematoma after drilling a single burr
hole in Reagan's skull.
   Dr. Henry Brem, an associate professor of neurosurgery at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said before the surgery that if
doctors in the course of the procedure were able to find and drain
the fluid from a single hole then the operation could be
accomplished quickly and easily.
   He said that typically the patient would be placed under general
or local anesthestia and that an incision would be made through the
scalp to the skull. Then a hole would be drilled, giving surgeons a
view of the dura, a tough membrane that covers the brain.
   ``They'll open up the dura and let the fluid out and that would
be the end of it,'' the surgeon predicted just hours before the
operation. Based on a statement released by Reagan's spokesman,
that, apparently, is what happened.
   Brem was not involved in the care and treatment of Reagan, but
did describe how such surgery is accomplished on most patients.
   ``He should do extremely well,'' he said. ``Patients usually do
beautifully in something like this.''
   Doctors at the Mayo Clinic discovered the subdural hematoma
during a routine examination of the 78-year-old former president.
They attributed the collection of fluid on the top, right side of
the brain to a riding accident last July. Reagan was visiting a
ranch in Mexico when a bucking horse threw him to the ground. He was
examined at an Army hospital, but declined to remain overnight after
treatment for bruises and scrapes. The following day, Reagan was
reported to be sore, but in excellent condition.
   Brem said that a collection of fluid in the brain cavity is
``plausible'' after such an accident, even though there was no
obvious head injury.
   Dr. Edward Laws, chairman of neurosurgery at George Washington
University Hospital in Washington, said it would not be surprising
if the jolt from a fall, particularly with an elderly person, would
cause a collection of fluid on the brain.
   ``This is usually because a little blood vessel gets torn and
causes some blood to leak into the space over the surface of the
brain,'' he said. ``As it dissolves, it collects more fluid and
expands.''
   He said it is common practice to remove such fluid collections,
even if they are causing no problems.
   ``They usually continue to enlarge and could ultimately cause
symptoms,'' said Laws. He called the surgical procedure ``routine.''
   Laws said that when blood leaks in the brain cavity it can remain
there and slowly change from a bright red to a black or even yellow
fluid.
   If left untreated, the fluid pool could cause further bleeding
and pressure, which could begin to damage brain cells.
   Neither Brem nor Laws personally knew any details of the Reagan's
medical treatment, and they could not be reached for comment after
the former president's surgery.
   Earlier, Laws, who once worked at Mayo, predicted that the
simplest procedure possible would be used.
   ``My guess is that they will just make a couple of small openings
in the skull and allow the fluid to drain out,'' he said before the
operation. ``That'll take about an hour and a half.''
   According to the spokesman's statement, the surgeons actually
used only one drill hole and completed the procedure ``without
complications'' in just over an hour.
   The statement said ``no further treatment is anticipated,''
suggesting, as Laws had predicted before the operation, that Reagan
``should be good as new.''
