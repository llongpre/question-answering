   At 7, Igor Ladan is already about 6 feet
tall and weighs 200 pounds. He's come thousands of miles from his
native Soviet Union in hopes doctors can remove a dangerous tumor
from his skull and stop his abnormal growth.
   Mayo Clinic surgeons plan to remove a rare pituitary gland tumor
from the boy doctors call a ``pituitary giant.''
   Igor and his mother, Svitlana Ladan, arrived here three weeks
ago after she waged a worldwide letter-writing campaign from her
native city of Kiev to find treatment for her son. The costs of the
boy's care are being donated.
   ``I was so happy, I nearly died,'' Ladan said last week through
a translator.
   ``People think 6 feet, not 6 years,'' said Nina Sahulenko, a
relative from Phoenix who is translating for the Ladans. ``But he's
still a child. He likes to play. When there are children around, he
will find those his own age.''
   Like other kids, Igor loves apple juice and gum and bananas and
ice cream, she said. And like other kids, he reveled in the
surprise birthday party his new friends in Rochester had when he
turned 7 recently.
   Igor is taking drugs to shrink the tumor from its tennis-ball
dimensions to a size that doctors hope will allow surgical removal
in about three months.
   The benign but still dangerous tumor at the base of his brain,
as well as his unusual size, are caused by an overproduction of
growth hormone by the pituitary gland.
   Igor seemed normal at birth, according to the family, but by six
months, he was the size of a 1-year-old. At one year, he was
equivalent to a 3-year-old.
   When doctors in Kiev and Moscow had no treatment, Igor's mother
wrote to the Red Cross in Switzerland, which advised her to write
to doctors and hospitals in countries such as England and the
United States.
   ``There were times she thought it was the end of the world,''
said Sahulenko, who is staying with the Ladans in special housing
for children undergoing treatment at the clinic.
   But letter followed letter, inquiry after inquiry.
   ``She is a mother,'' said Sahulenko. ``What else could she do?''
   The glasnost-era easing of travel and other restrictions on
Soviet citizens also helped, she said. ``Otherwise he'd never be
here.''
   The family eventually was referred to the Mayo Clinic and Dr.
Donald Zimmerman, a pediatric endocrinologist they now call ``the
miracle doctor.''
   Because the family lacks money and insurance, Zimmerman asked
the clinic to absorb the costs of Igor's care, and a pharmaceutical
house agreed to donate medicine.
   ``People have been so good since the moment she stepped from the
airplane,'' Sahulenko said. ``That is something wonderful in
America.''
   After the operation, radiation and follow-up drug therapy should
complete the removal of the tumor and stop the excess production of
growth hormone, a Mayo Clinic spokeswoman said Sunday.
   Zimmerman said last week that the boy's overall health is good,
although there is concern the tumor could press on the optic nerves
and interfere with his vision.
   Even without a tumor, he said, people with excess growth hormone
can develop problems such as nerve and muscle disease, degenerative
arthritis and enlarged heart muscles, and sometimes have tremendous
psychological and social problems because of their size.
