   Surgery, like youth, should not be wasted only on
the young, or at least the elderly should feel free to undergo it,
say researchers who found patients in their 90s tolerate operations
relatively well.
   ``If surgery truly can improve the quality of your life, you
should not be inhibited by age,'' said Dr. Mark A. Warner,
co-author of a study on surgery patients 90 years old and older at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   ``In the past, people were not being operated on purely because
they were old, and people believed they were frail and they would
not survive the surgery,'' he said in telephone interview Thursday.
   ``We were surprised at how well they did and that the rate of
surgery has increased dramatically'' in the 90-and-up age group, he
said.
   Warner and his colleagues found the 30-day survival rate after
surgery was 91.6 percent among the 795 patients age 90 and older
who underwent operations from 1975 through 1985 at the Mayo Clinic.
   A year after their operations, 68.6 percent of the original
group were still alive, and five years later, 21.2 percent
survived, about the same percentage as would be expected to live
for five years among people the same age who had not had
operations, the researchers said.
   ``These data demonstrate that patients 90 years of age and older
tolerate the stress of a surgical procedure relatively well,'' the
researchers said.
   What the figures don't show is the major improvement in quality
of life _ even if only for a year or two _ that surgery can provide
for extremely elderly patients, Warner said.
   For example, a 95-year-old woman with colon cancer might not be
considered a good candidate for surgery because of the likelihood
the malignancy has spread, he said.
   But forgoing the operation will doom her to bowel obstructions
that will rob her of her independence and keep her bedridden and
miserable for the last six months of her life, he said.
   Surgery may well prolong her life two years, and though she will
likely succumb to spreading cancer, she will remain much more
independent and physically comfortable than she would without
surgery, he said.
   Nationwide, surgical procedures are performed almost five times
as often among 90-year-olds and older people as they were 10 years
ago, the researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   As many as 100,000 operations may be performed on the
approximately 1 million Americans in that age group this year,
Warner said.
   The study suggests a dramatic improvement in survival has
occurred in the last 20 years. Two decades ago, a 71 percent
survival rate was reported 30 days after surgery in 90-year-olds
and older undergoing similar procedures, the doctors said.
   Although the recent results are not directly comparable to the
earlier ones, the differences are ``sufficiently striking'' to
suggest that better procedures, anesthesia and medical care have
helped improve the survival rate, the doctors said.
   The most frequently performed procedures in the Mayo Clinic
study were repair of broken hips, heart pacemaker implants, surgery
on the digestive system, prostate operations and hemorrhoid
procedures, he said.
