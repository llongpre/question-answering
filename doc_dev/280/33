Dr. Charles H. Mayo II, the grandson of one of the founders of the Mayo Clinic, 
has been fined $4,000 by the Minnesota Board of Medical Examiners for not 
diagnosing illnesses in his patients. During his 16 years with Group Health, a 
health maintenance organization in the Twin Cities, Mayo failed to diagnosis 
lung cancer in one patient, leukemia in another, skin cancer in a third, and a 
broken forearm in a fourth, according to a document signed by Mayo and Dr. 
George B. Martin, chairman of the board's discipline committee.

Mayo, who is practicing with the board's permission in a clinic in Moorhead, 
Minn., said he thought he was being unfairly singled out for review. "I feel 
put upon," he said. Mayo, 59, said he thought the fact that he carries a famous 
name in medicine was a factor in the review.
