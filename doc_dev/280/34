   More than three-quarters of people
trying to quit smoking were able to do so with the help of nicotine
patches in a study at the Mayo Clinic, researchers reported today.
   In a six-week study that started last fall, 77 percent of the
people who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking, said Dr.
Richard Hurt, director of Mayo's Smoking Cessation Center and one
of the investigators.
   The silver-dollar-sized patches slowly release nicotine through
the skin to the bloodstream. A control group in the study wore
patches not treated with nicotine, and only 39 percent of them quit
smoking.
   ``There were remarkable differences between the two groups,''
Hurt said.
   While cautioning that a long-term follow-up study is needed,
Hurt said the patch could be a ``remarkable advancement'' as a tool
for helping people stop smoking.
   The patch, similar to those used for dispensing some kinds of
medicine, contains 30 milligrams of nicotine. About 1 milligram of
nicotine is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are
better able to cope with the withdrawal symptoms associated with
quitting smoking.
   The Mayo Clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for
possible Food and Drug Administration approval. Results of Mayo's
study of 62 people were the first to be reported, and were to be
released today during a national conference of the American Medical
Society on Alcohol and Other Drug Dependencies in Atlanta.
   Other studies have shown an 8 percent quitting rate over a
one-year period among people who use such methods as physician's
advice, nicotine gum and self-help programs to try to quit smoking.
The one-year quitting rate has been about 25 percent to 30 percent
among those who participate in a formal smoking cessation program.
   The patch was developed by Elan pharmaceutical company in
Gainesville, Ga. Hurt said researchers are not sure how long it may
take before the nicotine patch, if it proves successful, will be
available for commercial use.
