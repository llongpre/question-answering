   The jailed wife of convicted spy Jonathan J.
Pollard has been moved to the Mayo Clinic for tests to determine
whether her health is deteriorating, officials and family friends
said today.
   Anne Henderson-Pollard, who was sentenced in April 1987 to five
years imprisonment as an accessory in her husband's spying for
Israel, was flown May 9 from Lexington, Kentucky, to a Rochester,
Minnesota, medical prison facility, said Kathy Morse, spokeswoman
for the Bureau of Prisons.
   Mrs. Pollard, who suffers from a degenerative stomach disease,
will undergo tests at the nearby Mayo Clinic by her former surgeon,
Bernard Goldberg, said David Turner, who heads a group called
Justice for the Pollard.
   The group is seeking improved prison conditions for the Pollards
and a presidential pardon. Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy
intelligence analyst, is serving a life sentence.
   Turner said he believes a recent letter campaign by Israeli
parliament members and public figures to U.S. congressmen and
administration officials was having an effect. He said that for the
first time since the Pollards' imprisonment, a friend from Israel
was allowed to visit the couple at their prisons last month.
   The friend, Amnon Dror, wrote a letter to the White House saying
he was shocked by Anne Henderson-Pollard's condition. He said she
was so thin her bones showed through her skin, her skin color was
yellowish and she clutched her stomach in pain throughout the
11-hour visit.
