   More than three-quarters of people
trying to quit smoking were able to do so for six weeks with the
help of nicotine patches, researchers at the Mayo Clinic reported
Friday.
   In a preliminary study that started last fall, 24 of 31 people
who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking, said Dr. Richard
Hurt, director of Mayo's Smoking Cessation Center and one of the
investigators.
   The silver-dollar-sized patches release nicotine slowly through
the skin into the bloodstream. A control group in the study wore
patches not treated with nicotine, and only 12 of 31 participants
quit smoking.
   Hurt cautioned that a long-term follow-up study is needed, but
said the patch could be a tool to help people stop smoking.
   Dr. John Pinney, executive director of the Institute for the
Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy at Harvard University, said
the results are consistent with other research on the patches.
   But he agreed with Hurt that a follow-up is important to assess
whether the quitters remain non-smokers after a year. ``The relapse
rate begins to accelerate from three to six months,'' Pinney said.
   The patch, similar to those used for dispensing medicine,
contains 30 milligrams of nicotine. About 1 milligram of nicotine
is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are better able
to handle the withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking.
   The Mayo Clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for
possible Food and Drug Administration approval. The others are in
Maryland, New Jersey and Georgia.
   The 62 people who participated in Mayo's nicotine study were
randomly divided into two groups with 31 receiving nicotine patches
and 31 receiving placebo patches that looked identical but
contained no nicotine, Hurt said.
   All were monitored weekly by a nurse who checked carbon monoxide
levelsto confirm whether they had been smoking. After the six
weeks, 24 people with nicotine patches had quit smoking and 12 with
placebo patches had quit, Hurt said.
   Of those who still smoked, all who had nicotine patches and 15
of the 19 on placebo patches had reduced their smoking by more than
half.
   The people who wore the nicotine patches were, by chance,
significantly heavier smokers before the study, Hurt said. They
smoked a median of 30 cigarettes daily, compared with 25 smoked
daily by the placebo group.
   Both groups had smoked for about 20 years.
   Researchers will track the participants at three-month intervals
for a year to determine whether they continue without cigarettes.
   Hurt said research at the three other centers may show that
fewer people quit in both groups but there is still likely to be a
2 to 1 ratio of nicotine patch quitters to placebo patch quitters.
   The American Cancer Sociey estimates that cigarette smoking is
responsible for 83 percent of the cases of lung cancer. Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths.
