   Former first lady Nancy Reagan will pinch-hit
for her husband in an appearance next week here that was to have
been Ronald Reagan's first since undergoing skull surgery, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   ``To be on the safe side, his physicians have recommended he not
travel away from Los Angeles until the second week in October,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in a statement.
   He said the former president's recuperation ``continues to go
well and his physicians are fully satisfied with his progress.''
   Reagan was working at home and was expected to return to his
office in about a week, he said.
   Reagan had been scheduled to speak Monday at the California
Grocers Association annual conference here.
   It would have been his first address since he underwent surgery
Sept. 8 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to drain fluid that
had accumulated on his brain after he was thrown from a horse July
4.
   Grocers Association Vicki Vance said Thursday's cancellation
came as a surprise.
   ``We were told his doctors didn't want him to fly, so we said we
could limo him up from Southern California,'' she said.
   ``Then they told us they didn't want him to travel at all. I
guess they just tried to hold off as long as they could.''
