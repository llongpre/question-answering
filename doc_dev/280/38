The grandson of one of the founders of the Mayo Clinic has been fined $4,000 by 
the Minnesota Board of Medical Examiners for not diagnosing illnesses in his 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
During his 16 years with Group Health in the Twin Cities, Dr. Charles H. Mayo 
II failed to diagnosis lung cancer in one patient, leukemia in another, skin 
cancer in a third, and a broken forearm in a fourth, according to a document 
signed by Mayo and Dr. George B. Martin, chairman of the board's discipline 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The four cases were among nine on which the board criticized the 59-year-old 
family doctor, citing records provided by the health maintenance organization. 
Group Health submitted copies of its internal review of Mayo to the board in 
1987, about the time Mayo left to go into private practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like he had nothing but problems," Group Health spokeswoman Pam 
Effertz said. "He was getting good results with many patients. As a matter of 
fact, some people will tell you what a caring doctor he was, and how he would 
give some elderly patients a ride home himself." 
</P>
<P>
Mayo said he felt "put upon," and that his famous name was a factor in the 
review.
