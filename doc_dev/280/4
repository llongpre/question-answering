Former President Ronald Reagan will undergo surgery this weekend to remove 
fluid on his brain that apparently resulted from his horseback riding accident 
two months ago, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The fluid was found during a routine exam at the Mayo Clinic, said Mark 
Weinberg, a spokesman for the 78-year-old former President. 
</P>
<P>
"President Reagan was found to have a small collection of fluid on top of the 
right side of his brain," Weinberg said. "Physicians believe this is a direct 
result of President Reagan being thrown by a wild horse in July in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Although President Reagan has not experienced any symptoms, physicians have 
advised this fluid be removed in a routine procedure which will be performed at 
St. Marys Hospital, a Mayo Foundation hospital, this weekend," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Reagan's treatment is being managed by Mayo Clinic physicians, 
who said that he is otherwise in excellent health. Reagan's wife, Nancy, who 
also underwent routine tests, was found to be in excellent health, Weinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair arrived in Minnesota from Bel-Air on Wednesday and checked into the 
clinic Thursday. They left the clinic this morning.
