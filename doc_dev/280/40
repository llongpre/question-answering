   Supreme Court Justice William Brennan is undergoing tests at the Mayo Clinic for an enlarged prostate that may have to be removed later in the week. 

   The 81-year-old justice, the court's leading liberal, said in a statement released by the court, "I plan and fully expect to participate" when the court term begins Oct. 5. 

   A court official said Justice Brennan's doctors in Washington don't believe the problem is one of prostate cancer. 
In 1977, Justice Brennan underwent radiation therapy for cancer of the larynx. 
But doctors at Mayo, in Rochester, Minn., want to conduct their own tests before deciding whether surgery is needed or some lesser medical procedure would suffice. 

   Justice Brennan said his doctors had urged "for some months" that the prostate problem be corrected, but he put it off because of a full schedule at the court and on the lecture circuit. 

   Justice Harry Blackmun, who had surgery for prostate cancer in 1977, is undergoing periodic radiation treatments at Mayo for recurrence of cancer in the tissue where the prostate was removed. 
Former Justice Lewis Powell, who cited his health as one reason for his recent retirement, underwent surgery for prostate cancer in 1985.
