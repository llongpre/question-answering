   Two prominent eye doctors are examining
President Bush at Bethesda Naval Hospital to confirm an earlier
diagnosis that he has a mild form of glaucoma, the White House said
today.
   Bush's eyes were being checked today by Drs. Richard Brubaker of
the Mayo Clinic and Harry Quigley of Johns Hopkins Hospital,
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush's own physicians determined during an annual checkup at
Bethesda Naval Hospital on April 12 that he has an early stage
glaucoma. Bush began daily medication at that time.
   Quigley and Brubaker are experts on glaucoma.
   Fitzwater read a statement from Dr. Burton Lee, the president's
physician, saying:
   ``These experts in glaucoma will conduct a series of tests to
confirm our earlier diagnosis and to reevaluate the choice of
treatment. I wish to reemphasize that tere are no problems with the
president's vision. His vision remains excellent. But I feel that
it is prudent to have outside experts assess the treatment
strategy.''
   Fitzwater said the exam was expected to take 60 to 90 minutes.
   After the April 12 physical, Bush began putting drops of a
medicine called Betagen every 12 hours. His doctors said Bush would
need to take the medicine for the rest of his life.
   Glaucoma can lead to blindness if left untreated.
   Before the exam, Bush was also attending a 50th anniversary
ceremony nearby for the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad.
   Brubaker is with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Quigley is
with Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.
   The president's wife, Barbara, is also under treatment for
problems that have interfered with her vision. She has Grave's
Disease, which has caused persistent double-vision.
