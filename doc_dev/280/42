   Former President Reagan received a visit
from Soviet maverick Boris Yeltsin today at the hospital where he is
recovering from brain surgery.
   As Yeltsin arrived at St. Marys Hospital, the Soviet politician
said through an interpreter that he had ``no intention of discussing
any business'' with Reagan.
   ``It wouldn't be very tactful. He's recovering from an operation.
I just want to have a courtesy call, that's all,'' said Yeltsin, who
is on a speaking tour of the United States and had asked to meet
with Reagan.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said the 78-year-old former
president is recovering well from surgery Friday by Mayo Clinic
doctors to remove fluid caused when he was thrown from a horse July
4. Weinberg said Reagan might leave the hospital by the end of the
week.
   Reagan ``has been following the visit with interest because
U.S.-Soviet relations are of special interest and importance to him,
and it's an opportunity to get Mr. Yeltsin's observations on what he
has seen in the United States,'' Weinberg said.
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin, an outspoken critic of some of Mikhail
Gorbachev's policies, was ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in 1987 but was elected to parliament with overwhelming popular
support.
   He has been prodding Gorbachev to step up the pace of reform in
the Soviet Union.
   On Wednesday in Philadelphia, Yeltsin stopped at the Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall. Yeltsin said he discussed 10 trade proposals
during a brief meeting with President Bush on Tuesday. He would not
give specifics.
