   Barbara Bush's nettlesome Graves disease,
which causes teary eyes and double vision, isn't getting any
better, but doctors say it isn't getting any worse.
   ``It's fairly stable,'' Mrs. Bush's spokeswoman Anna Perez told
reporters after the first lady returned Tuesday evening from the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   ``The eyes have not gotten worse. She's not out of the woods
yet. She's not cured. She's still got the disease,'' Ms. Perez said.
   The doctors examined Mrs. Bush for two hours, performing tests
and putting two doses of drops in her eyes. They decided to vary
the doses of prednisone she is taking for the condition, Ms. Perez
said.
   Otherwise, there was to be no treatment change.
   ``Believe me when I tell you, nothing is worse, everything is
better, I'm going home with very good news for George Bush,'' the
first lady told the Rochester Post-Bulletin.
   The long-range prognosis is unclear, Ms. Perez said, adding that
Mrs. Bush was in ``fine spirits'' but acknowledged annoyance with
the disease.
   ``These are some of the best times of her life and sometimes it
is a pain to have to see everything twice,'' Ms. Perez said.
   Mrs. Bush's condition, which initially caused a noticeable
weight loss, was diagnosed earlier this year. She has regained some
weight through water retention due to the prednisone.
   She underwent a radiation treatment in April to treat the excess
hormone levels produced by her thyroid. That treatment was
successful and the hormone levels are now fine, Ms. Perez said.
   Two Mayo Clinic ophthalmologists _ Dr. Robert Waller and Dr.
John Dyer _ were on the team of physicians who earlier examined and
treated Mrs. Bush for the eye condition.
   Graves disease, thought to be related to the immune system,
brings on an overactive thyroid, which in turn produces excessive
amounts of certain hormones. Symptoms include fatigue, insomnia and
swelling of eye tissues, causing irritation.
   The cause of the disease is unknown, but it can be controlled
with drugs.
   After the tests Tuesday, Mrs. Bush stopped by a Rochester
library and read a story to a group of children before returning to
Washington.
