   Former President Ronald Reagan will leave
St. Marys Hospital on Friday, one week after skull surgery, his
spokesman said.
   Reagan, 78, who met Thursday with Soviet parliament member Boris
Yeltsin and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, was to fly directly to
Los Angeles on Friday and return to his home, said spokesman Mark
Weinberg.
   Weinberg refused to release details of the departure.
   The surgery Friday by Mayo Clinic doctors involved draining fluid
that built up on Reagan's brain after he was thrown from a horse
July 4. The medical team is ``completely satisfied'' with his
recuperation, Weinberg said.
   Mrs. Dole, who was transportation secretary under Reagan, met
briefly with the former president on Thursday morning, he said.
   Reagan met with Yeltsin for about 20 minutes in his hospital
room, Weinberg said.
   Yeltsin gave Reagan a bouquet of red roses and, according to
Weinberg, told him: ``You gave the start to the very perceptible
warming of relations between the two countries. Your contribution to
this was enormous. You were very wise, courageous and tactful in the
way you went about it. I am very grateful to you for this.''
   Afterward, Yeltsin said through an interpreter that he and Reagan
``discussed life in the United States, we also discussed the
situation with perestroika (Soviet economic reform) and the Soviet
Union.''
   ``We discussed the American Revolution, the Soviet revolution, we
discussed the American people and the Soviet people. We mentioned
the fact that, although there are differences between them, we have
the same kind of sense of humor,'' he said.
   Yeltsin, on a speaking tour of the United States, had asked to
meet with Reagan, who ``has been following the visit with interest
because U.S.-Soviet relations are of special interest and importance
to him and it's an opportunity to get Mr. Yeltsin's observations on
what he has seen in the United States,'' Weinberg said.
   Yeltsin, an outspoken critic of some of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's policies, was ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in 1987, but then elected to parliament with overwhelming popular
support in a contested election. He has been prodding Gorbachev to
step up the pace of reform.
