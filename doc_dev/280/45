   Coronary bypass can help victims of heart
disease live better and longer even after they reach their 80s, and
no one should be denied the operation simply because of age, says a
study released Thursday.
   However, doctors cautioned that this common form of surgery
should be limited to folks who are healthy and independent except
for serious chest pain.
   ``All 80-year-olds are not created equal,'' said Dr. Gail E.
Darling. ``People with a lot of other illnesses are not considered
good candidates for bypass.''
   But if the patient is otherwise in good shape, she said, ``age
alone should not be a factor in the decision to proceed with
coronary bypass surgery.''
   Darling, a heart surgeon, based her recommendation on a review
of 159 octogenarians who underwent bypass surgery in the past 12
years at the Mayo Clinic. She presented her findings at the annual
scientific meeting of the American Heart Association.
   Before the operations, 97 percent of the patients had severe,
disabling chest pain that occurred while resting or during such
simple activities as cooking or walking. Afterward, most felt
dramatic relief from their symptoms and could lead more active
lives.
   An estimated 284,000 bypass operations were performed in the
United States in 1986. Darling said that while the surgery has
become relatively common for people in their 70s, many doctors are
still reluctant to perform it on older folks.
   The operation typically costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Some
have questioned whether it makes economic sense for the very old.
   ``Considering the skyrocketing cost of medical care, it will
become more and more of a philosophical issue,'' said Dr. Kent W.
Jones of the University of Utah. ``When do people get so old that
we say enough is enough?''
   The main drawback to the surgery was a relatively high death
rate of 11 percent. However, if they survived long enough to be
discharged from the hospital, the patients did relatively well.
   Overall, 84 percent of those undergoing surgery survived at
least one year, and 70 percent were still alive after five years.
   Darling said this was as good as typical survival for people
that age and better than what would be expected for those with
serious heart disease.
   Between 1977 and 1983, less than one-half of 1 percent of all
bypass patients at the Mayo Clinic were over 80. Since then, this
has grown to about 3 percent.
   The patients suffered pain because the arteries that carry blood
to their hearts had become clogged. During the operations, surgeons
used pieces of blood vessel to detour blood around the blockages,
restoring free flow to the heart.
