<HEAD>Reagan Speaks to Car Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan spoke to a convention
of rental car agents in his first speech since undergoing skull
surgery last month.
   Reagan and his entourage were whisked in a side entrance and
ushered to a hall at the plush Caesars Palace resort where he spoke
Wednesday to several hundred rental executives and agents.
   The former president waved at two waiting reporters and said he
was feeling fine. On leaving, he was asked how he liked retirement.
   ``Pretty good,'' he responded.
   The media was not allowed to attend the event and no news
conference was held. Mark Weinberg, a Reagan spokesman, would not
disclose what Reagan said in the speech.
   Reagan later returned to Los Angeles.
   Reagan had surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., on
Sept. 8 to remove fluid that had accumulated on his brain. The
injury resulted from a July 4 accident in which he was thrown from
a horse.
