   A year after banning smoking in all
buildings, the Mayo Clinic is taking on a new pollutant _ microwave
popcorn.
   Employees cannot pop corn in breakrooms, and the clinic has
removed the microwave product from vending machines.
   The ban was prompted by complaints from patients who were teased
by the smell while fasting in preparation for exams, clinic
spokeswoman Meg Black said.
   ``The strong aroma would permeate to patient areas, and it
certainly wouldn't be fair to tell them they can't eat and then all
of a sudden have them smelling popcorn,'' Black said.
   ``I can sympathize with those patients,'' said Tom Elsen of
Jolly Time Pop Corn of Sioux City, Iowa. ``Our only hope is that
they return to good health in the future and again can enjoy
popcorn for themselves.''
