   Former President Ronald Reagan read
newspapers Monday as he continued his recovery from skull surgery
and spoke by telephone with the chairman-designate of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, a spokesman said.
   Doctors have not decided when to release the 78-year-old former
president from St. Marys Hospital, where he underwent surgery Friday
to remove fluid that had accumulated on the surface of his brain.
   But ``physicians managing President Reagan's care are hopeful
that if the present rate of progress continues, President Reagan
will be able to return to California at the end of the week,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in a statement issued by the
Mayo Clinic, which runs St. Marys.
   Reagan's doctors report that he continues to make excellent
recovery, Weinberg said.
   In addition to reading newspapers, Reagan watched morning
television news programs and attended to routine office paper work,
Weinberg said.
   ``Shortly after noon, President Reagan spoke with General Colin
Powell, chairman-designate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
telephoned over the weekend to extend his good wishes. After lunch
with Mrs. Reagan, President Reagan plans to speak with former
Secretary of State George Schultz, who also called to wish President
Reagan well,'' Weinberg said.
   On Friday, surgeons drilled a hole in Reagan's skull to remove a
buildup of blood. Doctors said the problem stemmed from a July 4
incident in which Reagan fell from a bucking horse and hit his head.
The fluid was detected during a routine physical examination.
   Reagan's neurosurgeon told The New York Times on Sunday that a
brain clot had been detected earlier but that it healed on its own
without surgery.
   Neurosurgeon Thoralf M. Sundt told the Times that the first clot
was smaller and in a different area of Reagan's brain than was
operated on Friday. Because of the first clot, brain tests were
included as part of a regular checkup at the Mayo Clinic, Sundt said.
   Reagan has spoken several times by phone with his son, Ron, and
has been looking at the hundreds of cards and messages he has
received, Weinberg said in Monday's statement.
   On Sunday, Reagan walked unassisted outside his room, watched
football on television, wrote letters and posed wearing a Minnesota
Twins cap for a Mayo Clinic photographer.
   Nancy Reagan is staying in a room across the hall from the former
president and will stay until her husband is released, Weinberg
said. They are in a section of St. Marys separate from other
patients' rooms and kept under guard.
   ``They have meals together and watch the news together,'' the
spokesman said Sunday.
   ``He's normal in every respect,'' Weinberg said, adding Reagan
was not in any pain. ``To talk with him you wouldn't know he has had
surgery at all.''
