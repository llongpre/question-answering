   You're never too old to quit smoking, say
researchers who found that even people in their 70s significantly
reduce their risk of heart attack and death when they kick the habit.
   Their study disputes the notion that old people have already
suffered too much damage from smoking to benefit from quitting.
   They found that over six years, the death rate of older folks who
continued to smoke was 70 percent higher than that of people who had
recently quit.
   The study was based on people who already had clogged heart
arteries, a condition that affects an estimated 3.9 million
Americans over age 54. Other research is under way to see if older
people with healthy hearts also live longer if they stop smoking.
   ``The message is that it's never too late to quit,'' said Bonnie
Hermanson. ``Older people with heart disease have just as much
benefit from quitting as younger people do.''
   The study, conducted by Hermanson and colleagues from the
University of Washington and the Mayo Clinic, was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. It was based on men and
women over age 54 who took part in the Coronary Artery Surgery
Study, or CASS, a major review of coronary bypass surgery.
   Cigarette smoking is considered to be the chief avoidable cause
of death in the United States. According to the national Centers for
Disease Control, smoking was responsible for 320,515 deaths in 1984.
About one-third of them were smoking-related fatal heart attacks,
strokes and cardiac arrest.
   ``There is some feeling that it's too late for older people to
quit, because they have had too much damage over the years,'' said
Hermanson. However, ``there is very little data dealing with elderly
people. Most smoking studies are done on those who are middle aged
or younger.''
   Dr. John H. Holbrook of the University of Utah said the new study
shows the advantage of quitting in people whose heart disease has
been carefully documented.
   ``No matter how old you are, no matter how long you've smoked,
there's a benefit to quitting,'' he said. ``And as far as heart
attack is concerned, the benefits begin to accrue within a few
months.''
   The risk of lung cancer, another major hazard of smoking, also
drops when people stop smoking, although the reduction is not as
fast as the fall in heart attacks.
   The latest study was based on a comparison of 807 people who had
quit smoking within the previous year and 1,086 people who continued
to smoke. During six years of follow-up, 210 of the quitters and 391
of the continuing smokers died.
   The differences cannot be blamed on more severe heart disease
among those who continued to smoke. In fact, the quitters were
actually sicker than the smokers, the researchers said.
   Dr. Bernard J. Gersh, a co-author of the study at the Mayo
Clinic, said the lower death rate among the quitters resulted
largely from fewer heart attacks.
   Among the study's conclusions:
   _ After the researchers adjusted their findings for severity of
heart disease, those who continued to smoke had a 70 percent higher
risk of death.
   _ Thirty-eight percent of the smokers died during the six-year
period, compared with 28 percent of the quitters.
   _ Among those over age 70, 50 percent of the quitters died during
the follow-up, compared with 68 percent of the smokers.
   _ The greatest difference in survival was among those with
moderate degrees of heart disease.
   _ The benefits of quitting were similar for men and for women.
   _ The advantages of giving up smoking that were seen in older
people were virtually the same as those in middle-age people.
   ``On the basis of these results,'' the researchers wrote, ``we
believe that it is worthwhile for physicians to encourage their
elderly patients with coronary artery disease to quit smoking as
strongly as they do their younger patients.''
