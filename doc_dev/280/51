   The life-saving benefits of quitting cigarettes
continue well into old age, according to a study that found that
even people in their 70s significantly reduce the risk of heart
attacks and death when they kick the habit.
   ``The message is that it's never too late to quit,'' said Bonnie
Hermanson, who collaborated with colleagues from the University of
Washington and the Mayo Clinic in the study. ``Older people with
heart disease have just as much benefit from quitting as younger
people do.''
   The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
disputes the idea that old people have already suffered too much
damage from smoking to benefit from quitting.
   The researchers found that during a six-year period, the death
rate of older people who continued to smoke was 70 percent higher
than that of people who had recently stopped smoking.
   The study was based on people who already had clogged heart
arteries, a condition that affects an estimated 3.9 million
Americans over age 54. Other research is under way to see if older
people with healthy hearts also live longer if they stop smoking.
   The work was based on men and women older than age 54 who took
part in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study, or CASS, a major review
of coronary bypass surgery.
   Cigarette smoking is considered to be the chief avoidable cause
of death in the United States. According to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control, smoking was responsible for 320,515 deaths in 1984.
About one-third of them were smoking-related fatal heart attacks,
strokes and cardiac arrest.
   ``There is some feeling that it's too late for older people to
quit, because they have had too much damage over the years,'' said
Hermanson. However, ``there is very little data dealing with elderly
people. Most smoking studies are done on those who are middle aged
or younger.''
   Dr. John H. Holbrook of the University of Utah said the study
shows the advantage of quitting in people whose heart disease has
been carefully documented.
   ``No matter how old you are, no matter how long you've smoked,
there's a benefit to quitting,'' he said. ``And as far as heart
attack is concerned, the benefits begin to accrue within a few
months.''
   The risk of lung cancer, another major smoking hazard, also drops
when people stop smoking, although the reduction is not as fast as
the fall in heart attacks.
   The study was based on a comparison of 807 people who had quit
smoking within the previous year and 1,086 people who continued to
smoke. During six years of followup, 210 of the quitters and 391 of
the continuing smokers died.
   The differences cannot be blamed on more severe heart disease
among those who continued to smoke. In fact, the quitters were
actually sicker than the smokers.
   Dr. Bernard J. Gersh, a co-author of the study at the Mayo
Clinic, said the lower death rate among the quitters resulted
largely from fewer heart attacks.
   Among the study's results:
   _After the researchers adjusted their findings for severity of
heart disease, those who continued to smoke had a 70 percent higher
risk of death.
   _Thirty-eight percent of the smokers died during the six-year
period, compared with 28 percent of the quitters.
   _Among those over age 70, 50 percent of the quitters died during
the followup, compared with 68 percent of the smokers.
   _The greatest difference in survival was among those with
moderate degrees of heart disease.
   _The benefits of quitting were similar for men and for women.
   _The advantages of giving up smoking that were seen in older
people were virtually the same as those in middle-aged people.
   ``On the basis of these results,'' the researchers wrote, ``we
believe that it is worthwhile for physicians to encourage their
elderly patients with coronary artery disease to quit smoking as
strongly as they do their younger patients.''
