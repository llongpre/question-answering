<HEAD>Depression, Anxiety May Cause More Chronic Fatigue Than Disease,
Study Says</HEAD>

   Chronic fatigue can be as disabling as a heart
attack, but it may stem more from depression and anxiety than from
any physical cause, a new study indicates.
   In a report in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Kurt Kroenke, assistant chief of medicine at
Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, said many
doctors don't take chronic fatigue seriously enough.
   Such fatigue, which he compared to lower back pain, can result
in impairment in day-to-day activities resembling that in people
recovering from a heart attack or suffering from other serious
diseases.
   ``Fatigue tends to be underestimated many times in the
physician's mind as a minor complaint,'' Kroenke said Thursday.
``Fatigue is a symptom that doesn't affect the patients' lifespan,
but it causes a lot of disability.''
   Kroenke and his colleagues said 24 percent of 1,159 adults who
answered questionnaires at base clinics in 1986 identified fatigue
as a major problem.
   He and his colleagues conducted further studies on 102 people
who complained of fatigue lasting at least 30 days but had no
identifiable illnesses.
   Fifty-seven of them showed evidence of depression on
psychosocial and physical tests, while 58 of them had scores
suggesting abnormal levels of anxiety, and a total of 82 people _
80 percent of the group _ had one or both.
   In a comparison group of 26 people who had suffered no chronic
fatigue, only three people, or 12 percent, showed abnormal levels
of anxiety or depression, the researchers reported.
   They said a cause-and-effect relationship doesn't necessarily
exist between fatigue and anxiety or depression, because fatigue
could result from an unrecognized illness. But the ``consistent and
powerful findings'' on psychological tests, combined with an
absence of significant differences in lab tests between fatigued
and non-fatigued groups, ``indicate that emotional factors play a
role in chronic fatigue,'' they said.
   Therapy for fatigue sufferers could include reassurance,
counseling, psychoactive drugs and exercise, they said.
   The study did not explore the possible connection between
tiredness and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes
mononucleosis and has been suspected as a cause of chronic fatigue.
   But another study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association found a test for Epstein-Barr virus ``not helpful'' in
determining the cause of chronic tiredness, said authors led by Dr.
Walter Hellinger of the Mayo Clinic's facility in Jacksonville, Fla.
   They found no significant differences between 30 fatigued
patients who tested high for levels of a substance indicating the
presence of Epstein-Barr virus and 30 fatigued subjects who the
test revealed had low levels of the same substance.
   One co-author, Dr. Robert Van Scoy of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., noted the study did not deal with all tests for
Epstein-Barr, but just with the test for the early antigen, or
indicator, of the virus.
   Other researchers had reported in 1985 they found the
early-antigen test ``very useful'' in establishing the link between
the virus and chronic fatigue.
