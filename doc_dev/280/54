More than three-quarters of the people trying to quit smoking were able to do 
so with the help of nicotine patches in a study at the Mayo Clinic, researchers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-week study that started last fall, 77% of the people who wore nicotine 
patches had stopped smoking, said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Mayo 
Clinic's Smoking Cessation Center and one of the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The silver-dollar-sized patches slowly release nicotine through the skin to the 
bloodstream. A control group in the study wore patches not treated with 
nicotine, and 39% of them quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
While cautioning that a long-term follow-up study is needed, Hurt said the 
patch could be a "remarkable advancement" as a tool for helping people stop 
smoking.
