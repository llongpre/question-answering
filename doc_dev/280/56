   Doctors and nurses scurry to make their
rounds and patients in wheelchairs and gurneys fill the halls. It
looks like an ordinary hospital but the patients are convicted
felons, among them swindlers and spies.
   The Federal Medical Center could just as easily be a college
campus with its open spaces, tree-lined walkways and outdoor
recreational facility that includes a basketball court, ice rink and
jogging path. The combined prison and hospital moved onto the
grounds of a former state hospital that closed in 1982.
   ``We want the appearance to be reasonably attractive,'' said
Warden Joseph Bogan. ``We think it would be unproductive and unwise
to tear down the trees, remove the grass and put in concrete.''
   The tranquil scene has its limits. The 55-acre center is
surrounded by a double razor-wire fence, patrol trucks carrying
armed guards circle the complex and computerized sensing devices
detect movement along the perimeter.
   But unlike most federal prisons, the Federal Medical Center
concentrates security on the perimeter and allows inmates relative
freedom inside the fences. There are no bars on the windows of the
low-to-medium-security facility and inmates do not need passes to
move about the campus.
   The prison, located in this southeastern Minnesota town of 60,000
that's home to the Mayo Clinic, admits federal convicts who need
medical or psychiatric care. The only similar institution, the
Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Mo., is a
high-security facility.
   In Rochester, guards within the perimeter do not carry weapons.
Inmates are aware of the prison's policy that it will not give in to
the demands of prisoners in the event of a hostage situation, John
Chreno, executive assistant to the warden, said recently. No one has
tried to escape since the first prisoners arrived in October 1984,
he said.
   ``You wouldn't even know you're in prison here,'' said Michael
Rosenow, who is serving a three-year sentence for tax evasion.
Rosenow works in the prison's business office during the day and
takes classes at night.
   Frederick Coffey, who is serving time for a fraud conviction,
described the atmosphere as ``much more relaxed'' than other prisons.
   ``My idea of being incarcerated was the bar (on the windows)
scene, but we're mostly free to move around here,'' he said.
   Bogan defended the prison against criticism that it coddles
criminals.
   ``Most of our inmates will be back among us eventually and it's
in society's best interests not to brutalize them,'' he said.
   The hospital, which employs eight full-time physicians, 57 nurses
and 72 other medical personnel, can treat most illnesses except
those requiring kidney dialysis, Chreno said. The prisoners often go
to the nearby Mayo Clinic for treatment, and clinic doctors come to
the prison for consulting work or to perform surgery.
   ``Patients come here for everything from severe mental disorders
to personality disorders to terminal cancer to orthopedic work,''
Chreno said. ``We represent a cross section of the illnesses of
society. There's nothing in society that's not represented by some
offender.''
   About half of the prison's approximately 580 patients work in the
kitchen, on the grounds crew or in a factory which makes cables for
the government.
   About 120 inmates are there for medical reasons, about 75 for
psychiatric treatment and others for chemical dependency.
   Criminals who have spent time at Rochester include FBI agent
Richard Miller, who was sentenced in January 1986 to life in prison
for spying for the Soviet Union; Lee Alexander, the former mayor of
Syracuse, N.Y., sentenced to 10 years for running an
extortion-kickback scheme; and Anne Pollard, who is serving a
five-year term for helping her husband sell documents to Israel.
   The prison drew opposition when the plans for it were announced.
Gertrude Tyce, who led the fight, said she still believes prisons
don't belong in neighborhoods.
   ``But it's here now and we're not going to sit and crab about it
forever,'' she said.
