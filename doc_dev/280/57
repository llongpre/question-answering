University of Utah researchers reported in today's Annals of Internal Medicine.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SMOKING TRIPLES THE CHANCES OF A WRINKLED
FACE, STUDY SAYS
COMBINING SUN AND SMOKE IS EVEN WORSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But the news may cause smokers who get a lot of sun exposure even more
worry lines: The two factors combined increased the risk twelvefold, the study
found.;    In an editorial accompanying the study, a Mayo Clinic physician
said the news for smokers may help sell the message that smoking is bad for
health.;    While the link between premature wrinkling and sunning was known,
the authors said their study of 109 white smokers and 23 white non-smokers was
the first to scientifically link cigarette smoking with "laugh lines.";    The
researchers said they weren't sure why smokers' skin wrinkled earlier, but
suggested that known changes in the blood vessels feeding facial skin may play
a role, as well as the direct exposure of skin to tobacco smoke.;    Lead
author Donald Kadunce said he's also not sure how smokers of other races
experience wrinkling due to cigarettes. And he did not know if the wrinkling
reverses if smokers quit.;    Health officials could take advantage of the
study's findings as a new way to advertise the dangers, said Dr. Thomas Kottke
of the Mayo Clinic. "You're going to be old and ugly before your time if you
smoke" may be "just the message that leads (smokers) to throw away their
cigarettes for good," he said.;    The dermatologist who invented the
anti-wrinkle cream Retin-A, Dr. Albert Kligman, said the study backed his
impression of smokers' skin as discolored, loose and wrinkled.  </TEXT>
