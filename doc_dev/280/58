   Allan Bakke will say he has been working two
years as an anesthesiologist in a southern Minnesota town best
known for the Mayo Clinic.
   But the conversation ends there. Bakke, who claimed reverse
discrimination 15 years ago when his application for medical school
was passed over in favor of minority applicants, has maintained
silence over the case by refusing all requests for interviews. Even
with his colleagues the subject is taboo.
   ``I just really don't want to do it at all,'' Bakke said to an
interview request when reached by telephone at the Olmsted Medical
Group in Rochester, where he went on staff Aug. 11, 1986.
   According to the state Medical Examiners Board, the 48-year-old
Minneapolis native earned his medical degree June 18, 1982, from
the University of California Medical School at Davis. He served a
four-year residency at the Mayo Clinic and was licensed to practice
medicine in Minnesota in 1983. His file at the Medical Examiners
Board is free of any disciplinary reports.
   ``It would have been unfortunate had he not been able to pursue
his career,'' said Dr. Gary Oftedahl, medical director at the
45-doctor Olmsted clinic. ``Like any of us he could be replaced,
but it would have been unfortunate.''
   Oftedahl said Bakke doesn't socialize with his colleagues at the
clinic and is known for his quiet demeanor.
   ``He does a good job making patients feel comfortable before
they go into anesthesia,'' Oftedahl said. ``He's conscientious.''
   Bakke once led a fight to keep a federal prison out of a
Rochester neighborhood, said Dr. Gertrude Tyce, who worked with
Bakke as a member of the Olmsted Citizens for a Better Community.
The group's effort failed even though a non-binding referendum on
whether the city should allow the prison drew a record number of
voters who overwhelmingly opposed the prison.
   Tyce said the referendum was Bakke's pet project.
   ``I think Allan is a great guy,'' she said. ``He's a very
straight-up guy. Right is right and wrong is wrong.''
   But like Oftedahl, Tyce noted that Bakke steadfastly avoids
discussing the 10-year-old U.S. Supreme Court decision that cleared
his path into medical school.
   ``We thought he was sort of a local celebrity and introduced him
as such,'' Tyce said. ``He changed the subject immediately.''
   The blue-eyed, blond-haired Bakke, who worked 11 years as a
research engineer for NASA before studying to be a doctor, lives in
a $210,000 house just outside the city limits which he bought in
October 1986 with his wife, Judith, according to Olmstead County
real estate records. The couple has at least two children, Oftedahl
said.
   According to records at the state Board of Medical Examiners,
Bakke attended high school in Coral Gables, Fla., and earned his
engineering degree from the University of Minnesota. From there he
joined the Marines, where he earned the rank of captain.
   He scored an 80.3 percent average on his national board
certification examination, more than 5 percentage points above the
passing threshold, according to his application for a medical
license.
