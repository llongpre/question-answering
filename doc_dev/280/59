   The National Cancer Institute says a drug
used to fight worms in farm animals may be an important new device
against colon cancer in humans.
   ``I think this is an important advance,'' Dr. Samuel Broder,
director of the NCI said Monday in announcing strong results for
the drug when used in combination with an anti-cancer drug. ``We
might now be able to reduce the death rate due to colon cancer by
as much as one third.''
   Levamisole, a drug widely used to remove worms from the
intestinal tract of cows, horses, goats, sheep and even elephants,
was used with a cancer drug to dramatically increase the survival
rate among colon cancer patients, NCI officials said.
   The levamisole was used in combination with 5-fluorouracil.
   Levamisole is not approved for human medical treatment in the
United States, and currently is available to American physicians
only through a NCI research program approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. The drug, developed by a Belgium pharmaceutical
firm, is used in Europe, however, to treat intestinal parasites in
humans.
   The other drug, 5-fluorouracil, or 5-FU, has been a standard in
chemotherapy for some cancers for 30 years.
   The drug combination was used successfully in a small clinical
test and then expanded to a national clinical trial involving about
1,300 patients, under the direction of Dr. Charles G. Moertel of
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The NCI sponsored the national
trial.
   Moertel said the findings showed that colon cancer patients at
an advanced stage of the disease called Duke C experienced about a
one-third reduction in death and cancer recurrence after five years
when compared to patients who received either no drugs or
levamisole alone. He said previous studies showed that 5-FU had no
effect on colon cancer.
   It was only the combination, said Moertel, that gave ``a
significant reduction in the death rate.'' Just how the two drugs
work together is not now understood, Moertel said.
   Until now, there has been virtually no successful treatment
available for Duke C colon cancer patients, he said.
   Duke C, or stage III of colon cancer, is named for a physician
who first characterized the progress of the disease. At this stage,
the cancer has penetrated the colon wall and spread to the lymph
nodes, but there are no tumor cells detected in other organs. Duke
C patients also have had the obvious tumors removed surgically,
along with the nearby lymph nodes.
   Broder said that about 110,000 patients a year are diagnosed
with colon cancer and 44,000 will die of the disease. About 21,000
of those deaths will be among patients who first received treatment
at the Duke C stage of the disease, he said.
   In the past, he said, medical science could offer such patients
only surgery and regular examinations to monitor the disease
progress. Five-year survival rate for these patients is 30 percent
to 40 percent.
   Among Duke C patients receiving the drug combination, 49 percent
were alive with no detected cancer recurrence after five years.
Among patients in the study treated with surgery solely, the
survival rate was 37 percent, he said.
   Moertel said the treatment has not been demonstrated to be
effective in other stages of the disease.
