<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan left the hospital today, tipping his hat to 
well-wishers and revealing a shaved spot on his head where Mayo Clinic 
physicians performed skull surgery a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, 78, and his wife, Nancy, flew back home to Los Angeles aboard a 
privately owned DC-9 jet. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people, many of them travelers at the Rochester airport, gathered as 
the Rochester Lourdes High School marching band played while Reagan said goodby 
to Mayo Clinic officials and to retired Mayo physician, Dr. Oliver Beahrs. 
</P>
<P>
Beahrs, a friend of Nancy Reagan's late father, who also was a physician, said 
Reagan was returning home in good health. Doctors last Friday drained fluid 
that had built up on Reagan's brain after he was thrown from a horse on July 4.
