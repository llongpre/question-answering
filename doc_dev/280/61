<HEAD>Lung Surgery Scheduled For Joy Baker</HEAD>

   Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican
leader Howard H. Baker Jr., will undergo lung surgery Wednesday, a
family spokesman said.
   Mrs. Baker was admitted Monday to St. Marys Hospital in
Rochester, Minn., said spokesman Tom Griscom. The facility is
affiliated with the Mayo Clinic.
   In 1982, Mrs. Baker underwent surgery for lung cancer. Griscom
said he did not think she had experienced a recurrence of the
disease, but that Baker wanted to wait until after the surgery to
provide any details.
   Mrs. Baker is the daughter of the late Senate Republican leader
Everett Dirksen. Howard Baker served in the Senate from 1966 until
1984 and then was White House chief of staff for President Reagan
from February, 1987 until July, 1988.
   The Bakers' primary residence is in Huntsville, Tenn., but they
also maintain a home in Washington, where Baker practices law.
