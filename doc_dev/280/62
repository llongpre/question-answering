   Former President Reagan and his wife Nancy
will visit the White House next week for the unveiling of their
portraits.
   The ceremonies will be held next Wednesday in the State Room,
followed by a reception, deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said
Wednesday.
   It will be the Reagans' first return visit since exiting the
White House last Jan. 20.
   Both Reagans' portraits were painted by New York artist Aaron
Shikler. The oil paintings were commissioned by the White House
Historical Association, a private group.
   Shikler redid Reagan's portrait after Mrs. Reagan expressed
dissatisfaction with the initial effort.
   The Reagan portrait was completed in August and originally was
to be unveiled in September, but it was delayed when Reagan
underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic for a head injury suffered
over the summer when he was thrown from a horse.
   Mrs. Reagan has already provided a glimpse of the portraits in
her newly published memoirs, ``My Turn.''
