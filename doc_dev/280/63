   Talk-show host Larry King is about to be married
for the third time, but he doesn't consider himself a two-time
loser _ the losers are those who marry only once, he says.
   ``We are shocked when people marry several times, but if society
would admit it, the truth is that many couples who've been married
50 years probably met other people and were afraid to move on,''
King, 55, writes in the Sept. 29-Oct. 1 issue of ``USA Weekend.''
   King is confident his marriage to Julie Alexander, 41, who runs
a lawyer-recruitment firm in Philadelphia, will last.
   ``What Julie and I both know _ and this is what experience gives
you _ is there can never be anything after this, or anything as
strong,'' he said.
   King says he married his first wife, Alene, ``because in '61 you
got married if you wanted a family.'' They divorced after having
one daughter, King said, because ``we really never understood each
other.''
   He married his second wife, Sharon, in 1976. That marriage
didn't work, he said, because they competed for attention.
   His relationship with Alexander, who is once-divorced, is
different, King says.
   ``This will be the first time I'm walking down the aisle with
not only someone I love but also someone I adore and who is my
friend,'' he said.

   Marlon Brando's performance as a trial lawyer
battling South Africa's apartheid system in ``A Dry White Season''
won a thumbs-up from the man considered to be the inspiration for
the role.
   ``He's a great actor, and I was truly moved,'' George Bizos, a
lawyer who has handled some of South Africa's most famous political
cases, said Thursday.
   Bizos represented Nelson Mandela in 1963 when the nationalist
leader was sentenced to life in prison, and was involved in the
inquiry into the death of black activist Steven Biko in 1976.
   Bizos, who was attending a conference this week examining a
post-apartheid constitution for South Africa, said the film
portrays ``a compressed reality'' of life in the country.
   ``It's improbable that all those things happened to just two
families,'' he said, ``but all the events in the film have happened
to South Africans.''

   Sotheby's is holding its first horse auction
this weekend, putting 98 of entertainer Wayne Newton's prized
Arabian horses on the block.
   The sale Saturday evening at Newton's plush Casa de Shenandoah
ranch, on the city's southwest side, should bring in about
$750,000, said Sealy Rodger, a Sotheby's spokesman.
   Newton has been breeding Arabian horses for 25 years and is
raising a herd of more than 250 on his ranch at Logandale,
northwest of Las Vegas.
   Newton's ``Aramus'' herd, named after a favorite Polish national
champion stallion owned by the entertainer, is considered one of
the top five Arabian herds in the world.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose country
has some impressive large structures of its own, was astonished by
the heights of the World Trade Center nonetheless.
   ``They are such huge buildings that I could see from the windows
here, the other big buildings look like small villas in
comparison,'' Mubarak said during a visit Thursday.
   Mubarak, in the United States to push President Bush to support
an Egyptian plan for bringing peace to the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, stopped here as part of an Egyptian fashion
exhibit at the 110-story building.

   Former President Reagan had to cancel his
first scheduled appearance since undergoing skull surgery, so his
wife, Nancy, will stand in for him.
   Reagan was to have spoken at the California Grocers Association
annual conference here Monday.
   ``To be on the safe side, his physicians have recommended he not
travel away from Los Angeles until the second week in October,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said Thursday.
   Weinberg said Reagan's recuperation ``continues to go well and
his physicians in Los Angeles are fully satisfied with his
progress.''
   Reagan underwent surgery Sept. 8 at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., to drain fluid that had accumulated on his brain
after he was thrown from a horse July 4.

   The Rolling Stones won't solve this town's
budget crunch with a three-day stand at Sullivan Stadium, but
revenue from the shows will help save some programs.
   The town receives 66 cents on each ticket sold in return for
giving the stadium a tax exemption. Michael Coppola, clerk of the
town Board of Selectmen, said Thursday the three sold-out concerts
today, Sunday and Tuesday would bring Foxboro $108,000.
   Despite the cash rolling in with the Stones, another $200,000
has to be cut from various town departments.
   ``When you consider our total budget is $22 million, it's not a
huge amount percentage-wise,'' Coppola said of the Stones windfall.
``But it helps, you bet.''
   About 55,000 people are expected to attend each performance.

   Mark Harmon made no secret of his admiration
for Elizabeth Taylor during filming of a television version of
Tennessee Williams' ``Sweet Bird of Youth.''
   ``I'm a tremendous fan of hers, and I told her that right from
the beginning,'' Harmon said. ``I think she was having fun, too. I
think she's always wanted to play Alexandra Del Lago,'' a fading
movie queen who hooks up with a gigolo played by Harmon.
   An actor's goal should be to reach a level where you can ``work
with the great people and say the great words,'' Harmon said,
adding he got the chance to do that working opposite Taylor in the
TV drama, which will air Sunday on NBC.
   Harmon, 38, said he deliberately seeks parts that play against
his clean-cut good looks to avoid being typecast in lighter roles.
   ``People in this business love to find a niche for you. But I
need the challenges and I need to do different things.''
