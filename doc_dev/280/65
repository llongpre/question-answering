<HEAD>Mrs. Baker Has Malignant Growth Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joy Baker, the wife of former Senate
Republican Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., had a small malignant growth
removed from her right lung Wednesday, a family spokesman said.
   The tumor was removed during a 90-minute operation by Mayo
Clinic doctors at St. Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minn., said
spokesman Tom Griscom.
   The growth, he said, was removed from the right lobe of her
right lung.
   A source familiar with her case, who did not wish to be
identified by name, said the growth was ``a low grade tumor'' not a
recurrence of the cancer that was removed from the same lung in
1982.
   Mrs. Baker was to remain in the intensive care unit for two or
three days, and in the hospital for another 10 days to two weeks.
   She is not expected to require additional treatment, the source
said.
   Mrs. Baker is the daughter of the late Senate Republican leader
Everett Dirksen of Illinois. Howard Baker served in the Senate from
1966 until 1984 and was President Reagan's White House chief of
staff from February 1987 until July 1988.
   The Bakers' primary residence is in Huntsville, Tenn., but they
also maintain a home in Washington, where Baker practices law.
