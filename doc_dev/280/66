   Researchers have started a year-long
study to find out why polio survivors with Type A personalities may
suffer more severe post-polio problems than less-stressed victims
of the disease.
   The study will try to determine if there is a physical reason
why the high-achieving, hard-driving Type A's become more disabled,
said Richard Bruno, a psychophysiologist at the Kessler Institute
for Rehabilitation in East Orange.
   Bruno theorizes that all polio victims suffered brain damage
when the virus struck some 35 years ago. That damage is now
beginning to show up. The condition is known as post-polio sequelae.
   ``It's like running electricity in the house with only one
fuse,'' said Bruno, chairman of the national Post-Polio Task Force.
``It worked for awhile, but they finally blew a fuse.''
   Compounding the problem, Bruno said, is that stress adds to the
damage that has already been done.
   In an earlier study, by Bruno and Nancy Frick of Harvest Center
in Hackensack, 676 polio survivors scored 18 points higher than the
norm for Type A personality characteristics.
   Bruno wasn't surprised.
   ``They have to achieve more just to be the same. They have to be
time conscious. It takes them twice as long to get dressed,'' he
said.
   The pressure to strive and excel started in rehabilitation
therapy virtually as soon as they began to recover, he said.
   The earlier study also found that 88 to 91 percent of all polio
survivors said they suffered some symptoms of extreme fatigue,
weakness and muscle pain, all occurring decades after the original
polio virus attack.
   The survivors who scored highest on the Type A test suffered the
most severe symptoms, Bruno said.
   ``These people are overwhelmed,'' he said. ``They can't focus,
they can't remember. Sleeping doesn't help.''
   Bruno said the medical community should have known that many of
the 1.6 million polio survivors would be struck by these symptoms
later in life.
   He cited the 1949 work of Dr. David Bodian of Johns Hopkins
University who ``showed that the virus killed brain cells in the
cortex that controlled motor functions. ... It wipes out nerves
that go to blood vessels.''
   Bruno wants to test his theory that nerve cells damaged by polio
are further impaired when survivors under stress release a large
amount of cortisol hormone which keeps nerve cells from using
glucose. He believes this increased damage causes the extreme
fatigue, and may account for some of the other symptoms.
   Dr. Anthony Windebank, neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., said the cortisol hormone theory ``was certainly
a reasonable hypothesis. At the cellular level it makes sense.''
   However, Windebank questioned whether personality type had
anything to do with the severity of the post-polio symptoms.
   Mayo researchers studied a random group of 50 from the 250
people still alive who were stricken with polio between 1935 and
1955 in Olmsted County, Minn., where the clinic is located. About
20 percent of the 50 had ``quite significant problems _ the muscle
pain, fatigue and increased weakness,'' he said.
   But there was no tie-in to personality traits, he said. ``When
we looked at the psychological factors, there was no difference at
all with people who were having problems and the people who
weren't,'' Windebank said.
