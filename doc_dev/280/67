   A new study says that health insurers constrain treatment
of cancer patients by refusing to pay for unapproved uses of
cancer drugs.
   The report, based on results of a survey of oncologists by
the U.S. General Accounting Office, reflects growing tension
in medicine between the search for remedies -- or at least
relief -- for patients with difficult diseases and efforts to
control health costs by paying only for effective treatments.

   Physicians have long used drugs approved for one illness
to treat another, a practice known as prescribing medicines
for "off-label" uses. Drug companies, either tacitly or
directly, have encouraged such practices in a quest for
increased sales.
   But as treatment costs soar, the federal Medicare program,
employers, and private-sector insurers are increasingly
scrutinizing off-label uses, and cancer treatment is a major
target.
   "The costs of some {cancer} drugs have absolutely
skyrocketed, and the costs of supportive care are
extraordinary," says Charles G. Moertel, an oncologist at the
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. But because cures aren't
available for most advanced cancers and there is little
agreement on standard treatments, use of off-label cancer
drugs is widespread. "Some people feel it's necessary to
treat even if there isn't anything around that's any good,"
says Dr. Moertel.
   The GAO study, published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, represented views of 681 cancer
doctors and treatments they prescribed to 2,018 patients. It
found that one-third of more than 5,000 drug treatments
prescribed were off-label and that more than half the
patients received at least one off-label drug.
   About half of the oncologists said a third-party payer had
denied reimbursement for a drug used for an off-label
indication; 62% said they had admitted patients to a hospital
rather than treat them less-expensively as outpatients
because off-label prescriptions would be covered under
hospital reimbursement practices. And as many as 40% of the
doctors said they altered treatment strategies out of concern
for reimbursement and other cost barriers.
   The study didn't consider the appropriateness of off-label
treatments or how well patients fared with or without them.
But the GAO researchers, Thomas Laetz and George Silberman,
noted that reimbursement policies restricting off-label uses
could force patients to pay for the drugs, "implicitly
rationing chemotherapy to those who can afford it" and thus
possibly denying access to treatment.
   Martin D. Abeloff, president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, said both doctors and patients should have
ready access to off-label treatments. He said insurers
frequently use the term "off-label" as "a means of making
reimbursement decisions that are {often} not in the best
interest of the patients." Off-label drugs are most often
prescribed for advanced disease and in cancers that are most
difficult to treat, he said. "Sometimes relief of symptoms is
the best you can do and it's a very desirable goal."
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Mayo's Dr. Moertel
said some critics of efforts to curb off-label treatments
ignore cost-containment problems and noted that at
recommended doses, therapies with little proven value can run
up enormous medical bills. In an unusual case, he said he
recently reviewed a claim for nearly $750,000 of off-label
drug treatment given to one patient dying of colon cancer.
   He argued that physicians and third-party insurers needed
to work to develop policies that would support patient care
and clinical research and that would "minimize the financial
burden" on the nation's health care system.
