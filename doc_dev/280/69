   Dick Clark is justifiably proud of
his place in rock 'n' roll history, but he admits he wouldn't have
minded being a headliner instead of a host.
   ``My only regret is that I didn't study more on the piano,''
Clark said in a recent interview. ``I've gotten awards where I'm
mentioned in the same company of musicians, and while it makes me
proud, it also humbles me.''
   Still, he said, ``I may not be a king of rock 'n' roll ... but I
certainly was there playing midwife.''
   Clark, who hosted ``American Bandstand'' on television for more
than 30 years, will play host to The Spinners, The Guess Who, The
Association and The Drifters in the ``American Bandstand Concert
Tour'' at Bally's Grand Hotel Casino on Saturday.
   The tour is one of Clark's first performing jobs since he gave
the reins of ``American Bandstand'' over to his hand-picked
successor, David Hirsch, 26, earlier this year.
   Clark, who was 26 when he took over ``Bandstand'' and now is 59,
concedes that he stepped down reluctantly.
   ``It's one of those things I didn't want to say goodbye to,'' he
said. ``But I was getting out of an age range with the kids that I
was comfortable with.''

   A 17-year-old girl who allegedly took part in a
pornographic videotape with actor Rob Lowe reportedly told her
next-door neighbor that she planned to blackmail the star for $2
million.
   The neighbor's statement was contained in a court affidavit
filed last summer in Cobb County Superior Court as part of the
girl's parents' divorce, The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution reported Wednesday.
   The girl's mother filed a civil lawsuit in Fulton County on May
12 seeking unspecified civil damages from Lowe, and prosecutors are
considering possible criminal charges against the 24-year-old Brat
Pack star for exploitation of a minor. The girl was 16 at the time
of the alleged incident.
   News reports have said the girl, who turned 17 in April,
apparently met Lowe in Atlanta during last summer's Democratic
National Convention.
   An acquaintance said in an affidavit filed in the Cobb County
case that the girl said she and another woman had sex with Lowe
``and that they all took turns filming each other,'' the newspapers
reported.
   Television stations that have aired edited portions of the tape
have said it depicts the girl and another woman having sex, with
Lowe directing them off camera. The stations also say the tape
contains scenes of the actor and a male companion having sex with a
third woman.
   Lowe's public relations firm issued a statement late Tuesday
that Lowe ``will have no comment until the matter is resolved.''

   Some seventh-graders at Cedar
Springs Middle School hoped President Bush would give a warm
reception to their suggestions for running the country. So they
wrapped them in long johns.
   The letters, mailed Tuesday, were part of a spelling project
initiated by English teacher Janet Wilson. Students studied various
national and international problems, then wrote Bush to offer their
solutions.
   Homelessness and drug abuse were the students' major concerns.
Several suggested hiring the unemployed to build housing for the
homeless.
   The mailing included a pair of personalized flannel long johns
for the president reading ``I'm behind America'' and a nightgown
for first lady Barbara Bush.

   A founder of H&amp;R Block Inc. and his wife
have donated nearly $1 million to create a park to honor cancer
survivors.
   Richard and Annette Bloch said the park would be the first of
several similar facilities in cities in the United States and
Canada with populations of more than 1 million.
   Bloch survived a bout with lung cancer that was diagnosed in
1978.
   Mrs. Bloch said the centerpiece of the Kansas City park would be
a life-size bronze sculpture with eight figures representing people
going through a maze denoting cancer treatment and recovery.
   The park is to be named the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer
Survivors Park.
   ``The important thing is to show that there is life with cancer;
there is life after cancer,'' Mrs. Bloch said Tuesday.

   The curator of Harvard University's
prestigious Nieman Fellowship for journalists is taking a medical
leave of absence, the fellowship office announced Wednesday.
   Howard Simons, 59, is suffering from pancreatic cancer,
according to Lois Fiore, the assistant to the curator. An interim
successor was not immediately named.
   Simons was a Nieman fellow himself in 1958, and then rose from
science reporter at The Washington Post to become managing editor
in 1971. In that role, he helped oversee the newspaper's Pulitzer
Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal.
   In 1984 Simons took charge of the Nieman program, a one-year
fellowship allowing mid-career journalists to pursue a year of
unrestricted study with a stipend.

   Ireland's deputy prime minister was
recuperating Wednesday after undergoing a liver transplant at the
Mayo Clinic, according to Irish Embassy officials.
   Brian Lenihan, 58, underwent the surgery Tuesday night, embassy
officials in Washington said.
   Neither the Mayo Clinic nor the Irish Embassy would identify the
nature of Lenihan's liver ailment. However, Angela Phelan, a
reporter and columnist with the Irish Independent, said Lenihan
suffered from hemochromatosis, a disorder that causes excess iron
in the tissues.
   Lenihan, who also is minister of foreign affairs, and his wife,
Anne, have been in Rochester since May 2, the Rochester
Post-Bulletin reported Wednesday.
