   Former first lady Nancy Reagan has
returned to her home in Los Angeles and won't need follow-up
treatment for the small cancerous tumor she had removed here, a
family spokesman said.
   The surgery will not affect the Reagans' scheduled visit to
Germany, Poland and the Soviet Union beginning Sept. 10, said Mark
Weinberg, spokesman for Mrs. Reagan and former President Reagan.
   The basal cell carcinoma was discovered just beneath Mrs.
Reagan's left nostril during a routine dermatological examination
at the Mayo Clinic. A plastic surgeon removed it Wednesday at St.
Marys Hospital, and the Reagans returned to California a short time
later, Weinberg said.
   A basal cell carcinoma is the least dangerous type of skin
cancer and usually is caused by too much sun, said Dr. Peter Lynch,
head of the University of Minnesota's dermatology department.
Though there's little danger of serious illness, early diagnosis is
important because, if untreated, a carcinoma can destroy the skin
around it, Lynch said.
   Mrs. Reagan, 69, and the former president, 79, had been at the
clinic since Monday for routine annual checkups.
   Weinberg said doctors found the Reagans in otherwise excellent
health. He said he didn't know how long Mrs. Reagan had the tumor,
and neither he nor the Mayo Clinic could give further details of
the surgery.
   In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital removed Mrs.
Reagan's left breast and lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was
found.
