   One of every four medical schools does not
require students to be immunized, contributing to outbreaks of
rubella and measles in hospitals and schools, according to a newly
reported survey.
   Not one medical school surveyed followed all federal vaccination
recommendations against preventable, infectious diseases,
researchers reported in an article in Monday's Annals of Internal
Medicine.
   The findings come as public health officials worry about a major
outbreak of more than 19,000 measles cases in this country in the
first 35 weeks of this year. The majority of the cases were
attributed to failure to vaccinate.
   Researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and the
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis surveyed 144 medical
schools in the United States and Canada; 115 responded. Their
report did not name any participating schools.
   The failure to require immunization has left students and
patients unprotected against preventable diseases, the researchers
said.
   ``When a medical student or doctor gets rubella, and sees a
pregnant woman, or child, or elderly patient, the outcome could be
deadly,'' warned the study's lead author, Dr. Gregory Poland of the
Mayo Clinic.
   The survey, completed in 1988, found that 28 percent of the
schools responding to the survey had no immunization requirements
of entering medical students, which number about 15,000 a year.
   Thirty-one percent of the schools had no rubella immunity
requirement, 40 percent lacked a measles immunity requirement and
44 percent did not require proof of polio vaccination.
   The researchers noted that 97 percent of all the schools
required at least one immunization before students began their
clerkships, a training period in which they help treat patients.
   Poland said he was shocked at the report's findings, calling
them ``unacceptable.''
   ``We're exposed to so much more than the general population,''
he said, adding that previous studies have found that medical
students in clerkships or residency are 13 times more likely to
contract measles than the public.
   Poland said hospitals and medical schools were ``lulled into
thinking these diseases weren't a problem anymore,'' because they
saw fewer cases each year. That lessened the perceived need for
vaccinations, he said.
   ``But these viruses are there all the time, waiting to come
back,'' he said.
   Since the survey was completed in 1988, Poland pointed out, the
country has seen an outbreak of measles and mumps, with cases
nearing pre-vaccination levels.
   Poland said the study was sparked by the researchers' earlier
findings, published in January, that identified medical students as
the source of 13 percent of reported measles and rubella outbreaks
from 1980-88.
   Poland said not one of the schools surveyed followed all the CDC
recommendations for vaccinations against measles, rubella, mumps,
tetanus-diphtheria, hepatitis B and polio. The CDC also urges
medical students to receive annual flu shots.
   Even when state laws required vaccinations, not all schools
complied, he said.
   The authors urged schools to establishimmunization policies
that include subsidized or free vaccines, methods for monitoring
student compliance, and required proof of vaccination from a
physician.
