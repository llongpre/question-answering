In your editorial does the reference to "the arrogant cant of unthinking 
zealots" include the criticisms of countless medical doctors who have spoken 
out against animal experimentation? 
</P>

Among these enlightened physicians was Dr. Charles Mayo, founder of the 
world-renowed Mayo Clinic, who said, "I abhor vivisection. It should at least 
be curbed. Better, it should be abolished. I know of no achievement through 
vivisection, no scientific discovery, that could not have been obtained without 
such barbarism and cruelty. The whole thing is evil."
