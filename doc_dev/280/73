   Health officials are investigating whether
an outbreak of a rare blood disorder that has affected 26 people in
five states is linked to a dietary supplement taken for stress and
premenstrual syndrome.
   Twenty-one cases of eosinophilia have been confirmed in New
Mexico over the past two to three months, Dr. Millicent Eidson,
environmental epidemiologist with the state Health and Environment
Department, said late Thursday.
   She said an additional case has been reported in Arizona. The
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said a Missouri man and a
Mississippi woman are being treated for the disease, and an FDA
official in Denver said two cases have been reported in Oregon.
   At least 19 of the patients had been taking L-tryptophan, an
amino acid commonly taken to relieve premenstrual syndrome, sleep
disorders, muscle tension and stress. The non-prescription tablets
are sold under a variety of brand names in health food stores and
pharmacies.
   Eosinophilia occurs when there is an abnormally high number of
eosinophils, a type of white cell, in the blood. It has been known
to be fatal, although officials said there have been no deaths
among the recent 26 cases.
   Ms. Eidson said of the cases in New Mexico and Arizona, 17 were
among women. Sixteen of the 17 women and one of the five men had
taken L-tryptophan, she said.
   Teams from the federal Food and Drug Administration and the
Centers for Disease Control came to New Mexico on Thursday to
assist in the investigation.
   Dr. Edwin Kilbourne, chief of the Health Studies Branch of the
Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects at the CDC,
said the out-of-state cases ``raises the ante a bit.''
   Kilbourne, who planned to arrive in New Mexico on Monday, said
all agencies are being very cautious about making a connection
between L-tryptophan and the cluster of eosinophilia cases.
   ``The problem is an epidemic association and as far as I am
aware it is not very solid,'' he said.
   Ms. Eidson said the New Mexico and Arizona patients suffered
severe muscle pain and 10 were hospitalized. She said today that
one woman was still hospitalized early this week but she didn't
know if the patient has since been released.
   New Mexico health officials have asked retailers to halt sales
of L-tryptophan.
   Dr. Gerald Gleich of the Mayo Clinic said both the Missouri and
Mississippi patients had taken L-tryptophan.
   ``The thing that's unusual is seeing so many patients with the
same pattern,'' Gleich said. ``It's not like we haven't seen the
likes of this before. What's different is there are so many at one
time, and they're all taking L-tryptophan.''
   Dr. LeRoy Gomez, director of the FDA in Denver, said Oregon also
has reported two cases, but he could provide no details except that
one of the cases apparently involved L-tryptophan. He planned to
contact the FDA in Seattle to investigate the Oregon incidents.
