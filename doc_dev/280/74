<LEADPARA>  A combination of cancer treatments widely available in hospitals has been
shown to reduce the number of deaths from rectal cancer by one-third and the
chance that the disease will come back by nearly half, according to a study
published in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.;    The
National Cancer Institute's leaders consider the results so important that
they mailed a "clinical announcement" describing the study to 150,000 cancer
doctors last week. The institute also held a news conference Wednesday to
spread the news to the public.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A few years ago, the National Institutes of Health, of which the cancer
institute is part, began using clinical alerts or announcements to tell
doctors directly about important new research advances. Normally, physicians
learn about the results of new studies from medical journals, but it can take
months for them to be published.;    The National Cancer Institute focused
special attention on this study because rectal cancer is a common and deadly
disease, Director Samuel Broder said. An estimated 45,500 Americans will
develop it this year, and more than half will die within five years.;   
Traditionally, this cancer is surgically removed but frequently comes back.
Five years ago, a research group led by Charles G. Moertel of the Mayo Clinic
showed that treatment with radiation and anti-cancer drugs immediately after
surgery improved survival.;    But, Moertel said, "the combined treatment was
not accepted by the medical community" because the study included a small
number of patients and was technically flawed -- the patients received a lower
than usual dose of radiation, for example.;    In the new study, 204 cancer
patients treated in local hospitals throughout the Midwest received radiation
treatments and two anti-cancer drugs, 5-fluorouracil and the experimental drug
methyl-CCNU, immediately after surgery and without intolerable side effects.; 
  After following the patients for seven years, Moertel's North Central Cancer
Treatment Group, which organized the study, found that the added therapy
reduced the cancer-related death rate by 36 percent and recurrence of the
rectal tumor by 46 percent.  </TEXT>
