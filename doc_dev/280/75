KING HUSSEIN of Jordan was confirmed as being free from cancer over the
weekend, by doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
A statement issued from the clinic by the king's personal physician said
post-operative tests had 'confirmed the complete success of surgery' last
August and doctors had found 'no abnormalities'. The king will have regular
check-ups.
Speculation that King Hussein was still suffering from cancer, despite the
surgery, had been rife in Jordan and the foreign press since a speech he
made to the nation on 5 November which many people interpreted as an
admission that cancer might take his life.
'One recognises that every living soul will meet its destined end,' he said.
'When the time comes no hour could be postponed or brought forward.'
The king left the hospital ahead of schedule and is due to spend a few days
in Washington, before returning to Jordan.
