<HEAD>Cancer Institute Says Drug Combination Aids Colon Cancer Patients</HEAD>

   A drug used to deworm farm animals combined
with a common cancer drug has been found to save the lives of
patients who would have died from an advanced type of colon cancer,
the National Cancer Institute announced today.
   NCI Director Samuel Broder said that a national study involving
about 1,300 patients with a stage 3 type of colon cancer showed
increased survival rates for those treated with a drug called
levamisole in combination with 5-fluorouracil, a cancer drug now in
common use.
   The study was directed by Dr. Charles G. Moertel of the Mayo
Clinic.
   At a news conference today, Moertel said that the study showed
49 percent of stage III colon cancer patients were alive five years
after therapy with the drug combination compared to only 37 percent
of such patients who received no drugs. Both of the patient groups
being compared had been treated with surgery, which revealed that
the colon cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes.
   In cancer therapy this stage of the disease is called Dukes' C.
   With today's announcement, Broder said that physicians are
encouraged to discuss this treatment option with patients at this
stage of colon cancer.
   He said the combination drug therapy is started three to five
weeks after surgery and is continued for about a year.
   Levamisole is a drug that is used by veterinarians to clear
worms from the intestine of barnyard animals. It is not now
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for any human use in
the United States.
   The drug, however, is commonly used in Europe to treat worm
infestation in humans and it has been used widely in experimental
treatment of cancers.
   Moertel said the drug combination of levamisole and
5-fluorouracil has not been proven effective against colon cancers
at an earlier stage in the disease or for those whose surgeries
occurred at a much earlier time.
   Broder said a specific description of this new treatment method
is being mailed to doctors around the country and that physicians
may obtain levamisole through the National Cancer Institute.
