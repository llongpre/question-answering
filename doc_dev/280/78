<LEADPARA>  It wasn't quite the Battle of the Bulge. More like the Battle of the Buttons.;
   A crowd of about 160 jammed Palo Alto City Council chambers Monday night,
wearing their impartiality on their lapels. One side sported "Palo Alto
Medical Foundation" buttons in support of the clinic's quest to expand its
facilities. The other side flaunted "Hold the Mayo" buttons, mocking the
foundation's drive to become the Mayo Clinic of the West.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     After nearly four years of give and take, it has come to this: a showdown
between the medical foundation and the city over the clinic's plans to expand
by 45,000 square feet.;    Tonight, the city council is expected to decide
whether to give the go-ahead for that proposal. On Monday, council members
heard a mouthful from a boisterous crowd as to what their decision should be.;
   Fear of growth;    "Our biggest fear is that the foundation will not
contain its growth," said Jeanne Moulton, who lives near the clinic. "We think
45,000 square feet is a bargaining chip. We think every additional square foot
is a degradation to our neighborhood.";    Neighbors of the clinic harbor
serious concerns that the clinic's expansion will exacerbate traffic and noise
in their residential neighborhood.;    Clinic representatives downplay those
concerns. Instead, they argue the expansion is necessary to serve their
102,000-patient clientele, which includes 40 percent of Palo Alto residents.; 
  "This is a real center of medicine. We take great pride in that," said Dr.
Robert Jamplis, president of the foundation. "We need this plan. We need it
for our patients.";    Size limit offered;    Although medical foundation
representatives originally lobbied the city for a 65,000-square-foot
expansion, they now say they could limit their expansion on their site south
of downtown to 45,000 square feet and look elsewhere to build the remaining
20,000 square feet.;    The city's planning commission, however, is
recommending only 35,000 square feet.;    The foundation wants to consolidate
its maze-like campus of 13 buildings and six parking lots spread over nine
blocks south of downtown. It wants to accomplish that by tearing down some
buildings and constructing new ones within a 2 1/4-block area along Homer and
Channing avenues between Ramona and Waverley streets.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;
Tonight's council meeting will begin at 7:30 in council chambers, 250 Hamilton
Ave., Palo Alto.  </TEXT>
