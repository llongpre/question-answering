<HEAD>Serrano Sworn in as Congressman from Nation's Poorest District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Moments after being sworn in, Rep. Jose
Serrano, D-N.Y., said the first thing he wants to do in his new job
is go home to the South Bronx and talk to children.
   ``Part of what I want to do is go right back into the classroom
and tell kids all about this experience,'' Serrano said.
   He took the oath of office Wednesday, the 38th anniversary of
his mother's arrival in New York from Puerto Rico to join her
husband and seek a better life.
   ``Let the message go from here today to those children who are
still in the projects and who are on the street corner that there
is a better tomorrow,'' Serrano told the House of Representatives
after the swearing-in.
   He was joined on the House floor with three of his five
children. His wife, Mary, brother, other children and about 200
campaign workers stood in the gallery and cheered.
   Serrano, 46, won a landslide victory in a special election March
20 to fill the seat vacated in January when Rep. Robert Garcia,
D-N.Y., resigned. Garcia was convicted of accepting bribes in the
Wedtech influence-peddling scandal.
   Serrano is the only voting Puerto Rican-born member of Congress.
His swearing-in came one day after Susan Molinari, a Staten Island
Republican, took her oath of office. At 32, she is the youngest
member of Congress.

<HEAD>Mrs. Baker Has Malignant Growth Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican
Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., has had a small malignant growth
removed from her right lung.
   The tumor was removed Wednesday during a 90-minute operation by
Mayo Clinic doctors at St. Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minn., said
spokesman Tom Griscom.
   A source familiar with her case, who did not wish to be
identified by name, said the growth was ``a low grade tumor'' not a
recurrence of the cancer that was removed from the same lung in
1982.
   She is not expected to require additional treatment, the source
said.
   Mrs. Baker is the daughter of the late Senate Republican leader
Everett Dirksen of Illinois. Howard Baker served in the Senate from
1966 until 1984 and was President Reagan's White House chief of
staff from February 1987 until July 1988.
   The Bakers' primary residence is in Huntsville, Tenn., but they
also maintain a home in Washington, where Baker practices law.

<HEAD>Outspoken Civil Rights Champion to Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., who came
to Congress at age 70 after a controversial career as civil rights
attorney and judge, says he will retire after his term expires next
year.
   ``There is a time ... when each man or woman must decide to
leave the day-to-day struggle to others,'' the 80-year-old chairman
of the House Western Hemisphere Affairs Subcommittee said Wednesday.
   Crockett had announced his candidacy for a sixth term but faced
at least two challengers for the Democratic nomination in his
predominantly black Detroit district, which could be eliminated as
districts are reapportioned in 1992.
   He said in an interview the prospect of a tough campaign did not
influence his change of heart. ``I've just gotten older and
wiser,'' he said.
   Crockett recently became the first member of Congress to
advocate decriminalizing drug use, the latest of many stands that
outraged conservatives and even made some fellow liberals uneasy.
   He gained national attention in 1949 for his spirited defense of
11 avowed communists charged with subversion in New York. His
clashes with the presiding judge landed him and four other defense
lawyers in prison for four months on contempt charges.
