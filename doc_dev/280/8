   Former President Reagan was in excellent
condition today after successful, hourlong brain surgery to remove
blood that accumulated following a horseback riding accident this
summer, spokesmen said.
   ``President Reagan is conscious and recovering in his room, where
he is comfortable and in good spirits,'' Mark Weinberg said, adding
that the operation went without complications.
   Weinberg said Friday he was unsure how long Reagan would remain
at St. Marys Hospital, which is part of the Mayo Clinic. ``When the
doctors tell him he can go home, he will,'' he said.
   The chief surgeon, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt, would not comment on the
operation or the outlook for recovery, but Weinberg said Reagan was
listed in ``excellent and stable'' condition after the one-hour
operation ended about 5:15 p.m.
   At midmorning today, Dr. Michael J. Ebersold, a Mayo Clinic
spokesman, said Reagan's condition was unchaged, describing it as
stable. He refused to elaborate.
   Nancy Reagan spent the night in a room across the hall from her
husband at the hospital.
   Weinberg said the 78-year-old former president ``will be
carefully monitored, although no further treatment is anticipated.''
   Henry Brem, a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University Hospital
in Baltimore who was not involved in the surgery, said normal
recovery periods for the type of operation Reagan received include
about a week of hospitalization.
   The fluid on the upper right side of the brain _ blood that
accumulated after Reagan was bucked from a horse July 4 _ was found
during a routine examination at Mayo, where the Reagans have
received annual checkups since their pre-White House days.
   The decision to perform the surgery was made Friday morning after
doctors reviewed the results of a CAT scan done Thursday as a
follow-up to the horseback riding accident, Weinberg said. Neither
the former president nor Mrs. Reagan objected to the surgery, he
said.
   Sundt, an internationally renowned specialist in the human blood
delivery system who also is editor of the Journal of Neurosurgery,
was assisted by two other Mayo neurosurgeons, an anesthesiologist
and three nurses.
   Although Reagan had not experienced any symptoms, physicians had
advised the fluid be removed by making a ``small burr hole'' in
Reagan's skull and draining the fluid, Weinberg said. The procedure
was performed under a general anesthesia.
   Weinberg's description of the president's problem as a ``subdural
hematoma'' indicated the fluid had collected underneath the dura, a
membrane that covers the brain inside the skull. A hematoma is a
pool of blood, as in a bruise.
   A checkup at the clinic found the former president in otherwise
good health.
   President Bush tried to phone his predecessor from Air Force One
en route from New Orleans to Washington, but Reagan had already
entered surgery.
   ``I hope it's all right, pray it's all right,'' Bush told
reporters.
   The Reagans arrived Wednesday in the southeastern Minnesota town
about 70 miles southeast of Minneapolis and checked into the clinic
Thursday.
   The horse riding accident happened while Reagan was visiting the
ranch of William Wilson, a friend, near Cananea, Mexico, about 30
miles south of the Arizona border.
   Reagan was flown to an Army hospital in Arizona and kept about
four hours, declining a doctor's suggestion that he remain overnight
for observation. He was described as suffering from scrapes and
bruises.
   During his two terms, Reagan was hospitalized several times,
recovering from various ailments at a speed doctors called
impressive for a man his age.
   On March 30, 1981, Reagan was wounded in an assassination
attempt. A bullet one inch from his heart was removed, but by Oct.
30 he was declared in excellent health. On July 13, 1985, he
underwent successful surgery for cancer of the colon. Later
examinations during the balance of his second term showed no
recurrence.
   He also had surgery during his second term for enlargement of the
prostate, for skin cancer and for Dupuytrin's contracture, a
condition that caused his left hand to curve inward.
