   Large bulges in the main blood vessel in the
abdomen should be repaired because they are likely to burst, but
most small ones do not require routine surgery, a study published
today concludes.
   These balloon-like bulges, known as abdominal aortic aneurysms,
are being increasingly spotted as people undergo ultrasound tests
to check for other problems, such as gallstones and cancer.
   About 40,000 Americans have surgery to repair these aneurysms
each year, but some doubt lingers about whether smaller aneuryisms
can be safely ignored. When the aneurysms break, massive bleeding
may result, and about half of all such victims die.
   The latest study, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, found that most
abdominal aortic aneurysms expand slowly, and small ones pose
little risk of rupture.
   ``Our data indicate that all small aneurysms do not need to be
routinely repaired,'' said Dr. John W. Hallett Jr., senior author
of the study. ``Their repair should be individualized.''
   He said that in some cases, repair of small aneurysms may be
considered reasonable, such as when patients suffer painful
symptoms or have other blood vessel disease. Overall, he estimated
that surgery is appropriate for about one-third of patients with
small abdominal aneurysms under 5 centimeters in size.
   For the rest, he recommended that doctors follow patients with
exams every three to six months.
   The latest study, based on a survey 370 aneurysm patients in
Rochester, Minn., was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Hallett said some surgeons recommend fixing all aneurysms
because of the belief that they will eventually expand and rupture.
However, several vascular surgeons said they are very selective and
limit routine surgery to patients with aneurysms larger than 4 or 5
centimeters.
   ``I don't think anybody has evidence that aneurysm surgery is
overused,'' said Dr. William Abbott of Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``I do exactly as they say. I am quite aggressive with
aneurysms over 5 centimeters and very selective on something that's
smaller. I don't think this will blow the medical profession away.''
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. E. Stanley
Crawford of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston recommended
surgery for aneurysms larger than 4 centimeters. He questioned the
selection and diagnosis of patients in the study and said he does
not believe it accurately reflects the natural course of aneurysms.
   In the study, doctors concluded that the risk of rupture after
eight years was 25 percent in people with aneurysms larger than 5
centimeters, 5 percent in those with aneurysms between 3.5 and 5
centimeters and zero in people with aneurysms smaller than 3.5
centimeters.
