   Details of a major new study showing that a
veterinary drug is the first medicine to save the lives of people
with advanced operable colon cancer should presuade doctors to
offer the treatment, a researcher contends.
   Dr. Charles G. Moertel of the Mayo Clinic estimates that routine
use of this approach for all potential patients could save about
5,000 lives annually.
   Doctors from the National Cancer Institute sent letters to
doctors outlining the findings last fall, but the first in-depth
account of the research appears in today's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   ``The data in this large trial are just overwhelmingly
convincing,'' said Moertel, who directed the study.
   The treatment uses levamisole, which is ordinarily given to
de-worm farm animals, and the standard cancer medicine
fluorouracil. When tested on 1,296 colon cancer patients, it
reduced cancer recurrence by 41 percent, and it lowered the death
rate by one-third.
   In October, the cancer institute wrote letters to about 35,000
doctors describing the findings of this and a smaller, earlier
study that was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
However, some doctors remained skeptical.
   ``With publication in a prestigious journal, they will review
this information and decide it is worth trying,'' predicted Dr.
Michael Friedman, chief of the cancer institute's therapy
evaluation program.
   Levamisole is not commercially available in the United States
for human use. However, since May the cancer institute has
distributed it without cost to physicians who wanted to use it for
colon cancer.
   Moertel said that about one-third of potential patients are
getting it this way. Another one-third with advanced operable colon
cancer are enrolled in experimental drug studies, and some of them
are also receiving levamisole as well as other medicines.
   Moertel said some doctors are probably not using the medicine
because of the extra paper work necessary to obtain it for
patients, while others were reluctant to adopt the therapy until
they saw detailed results.
   Last week, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended that Janssen
Pharmaceutica Inc. be given permission to sell the medicine for
routine use. Eva Kemper, an FDA spokeswoman, said Wednesday that
final approval should come within a month or so.
   Of the 110,000 Americans diagnosed with colon cancer annually,
about 22,000 have stage C disease. Their cancer has spread to
nearby lymph nodes but can still be removed surgically.
   Moertel said that 95 percent of stage C patients should receive
the two-drug combination.
   ``At the present time, with the known rate of occurrence of C
stage colon cancer, this could translate into saving about 5,000
lives annually who would now die of recurrent colon cancer,'' he
said.
   Studies are also under way to see if the treatment saves the
lives of people with less advanced colon cancer that has spread
into the wall of the colon but not invaded lymph nodes.
