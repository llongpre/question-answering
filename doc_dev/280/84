   Joy Dirksen Baker, wife of White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker, has had numerous hospital stays for
ailments ranging from back pain to lung cancer in recent years.
   Baker mentioned the health of his wife and his stepmother, Irene
Baker, in his announcement Tuesday that he will resign as White
House chief of staff.
   Joy Baker was listed in satisfactory condition with a chronic
back ailment Tuesday and, in a separate Knoxville hospital, Irene
Baker was in fair condition with stomach pains.
   Baker, a Tennessee Republican and former Senate majority leader,
will be replaced by his deputy, Kenneth Duberstein, on July 1,
White House officials said.
   Joy Baker, 59, was admitted to St. Mary's Medical Center on
Thursday for treatment of a back ailment, a condition that has
required hospitalization several times in recent years, said
hospital spokeswoman Janice Webster.
   In spring 1986, Mrs. Baker entered a North Carolina hospital for
evaluation and treatment of back pain. She has been admitted twice
in recent years to a Nashville hospital for back pain and has
traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for evaluation and
treatment of the back pain.
   Two months ago, she was admitted for treatment of acute
bronchitis at another Knoxville hospital. About a year earlier she
spent a few days in a Washington hospital for follow-up tests after
surgery in spring 1986 on a non-malignant intestinal obstruction.
   Mrs. Baker had a malignant tumor removed from her right lung in
1982 and also has been hospitalized for stomach ulcers.
   Baker, 62, had considered running for the Republican
presidential nomination but decided to accept the February 1987
appointment as White House chief of staff, succeeding Donald Regan.
He had said his wife's health would be a factor in deciding whether
to run for president.
   Joy Baker is the daughter of the late Sen. Everett Dirksen, an
Illinois Republican who held office from 1951 until his death Sept.
7, 1969, and had been the Senate GOP leader since 1959.
   Irene Baker, 86, was admitted to Baptist Hospital in Knoxville
this week and was undergoing tests for stomach pains.
   After Baker's father, Howard H. Baker Sr., died in January 1964,
Irene Baker won a special election to serve the rest of his term as
U.S. representative in 1964-65. The elder Baker was first elected
in 1951.
