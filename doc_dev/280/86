<LEADPARA>  Important advances in medicine can occur wherever there is the willingness to
try dramatic new techniques, said Dr. Christiaan Barnard, the South African
surgeon who in 1967 performed the first human heart transplant.;    "Just
think of the Mayo Clinic. It started in Rochester, Minnesota," Barnard said
Thursday before today's official opening of a regional laser surgery center at
Redding Medical Center.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "So I never say a place is too small to acquire new technology," Barnard
said. "This hospital is progressing because they have the guts to introduce
new techniques.";    Barnard is a consultant to fellow physician and South
African Stephen Joffe, whose company developed the laser center in Redding and
who said there is still some reluctance by physicians to use laser surgery.;  
 "It's fear of the unknown," Joffe said.;    Redding Medical Center has used
lasers on a limited basis for a number of years, primarily for
ophthalmological surgery, said hospital director Gerald Knepp. But the newly
expanded center will offer a comprehensive laser program, Knepp said.  </TEXT>
