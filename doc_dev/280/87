New research shows that a combination of two drugs given after surgery 
substantially reduces the death rate for patients with advanced colon cancer, 
the National Cancer Institute announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major advance," Dr. Samuel Broder, director of the cancer institute, 
said at a press conference. "The results suggest we might be able to reduce the 
death rate by as much as one-third." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials said the findings are so compelling that researchers 
have decided to discontinue comparison portions of the studies in which 
patients are under observation only with no drug therapy, and will urge those 
patients to consider taking the combination drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Alerted 
</P>
<P>
Also, Broder said, the cancer institute has alerted 35,000 physicians, surgeons 
and major institutions treating cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged about this," said Joanne Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the 
American Cancer Society. "There is definitely a need for more armaments in the 
war against advanced colon cancer." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, an estimated 107,000 new cases of colon cancer are expected. Excluding 
common skin cancers, the combined incidence of colon and rectum cancer -- 
estimated at a total of 151,000 new cases this year -- is second only to lung 
cancer in this country. About 53,500 colon cancer deaths are expected this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The studies used levamisole, a drug that has been available in this country 
only to veterinarians for the treatment of intestinal worms, and 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU), a well-known anti-cancer drug for more than 30 years. The drugs were 
started three to five weeks after surgery and given for one year to colon 
cancer patients whose cancer had spread to the adjacent lymph nodes, an 
advanced stage of colon cancer known as Dukes' C. About 21,000 people will be 
diagnosed this year with Dukes' C colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, 49% of the patients were alive five years after therapy, 
contrasted with only 37% of those who received no further treatment after 
surgery, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, 408 patients with Dukes' B -- an earlier stage -- or Dukes' C 
colon cancer were randomly chosen to receive either observation only after 
surgery, levamisole alone or the combination drug therapy. Compared to the 
post-surgical observation-only group, the patients who received both levamisole 
and 5-FU had "significantly fewer" tumor recurrences after five years, 55% 
versus 41%. In cases that did recur, those using the drug combination had 
longer delays before recurrence -- 23 months versus 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the combination therapy on Dukes' B colon cancer were inconclusive, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Patients Not Helped 
</P>
<P>
Also, the treatment is of no benefit to patients whose cancer has spread beyond 
the lymph nodes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The study was sponsored by the cancer institute and conducted by the North 
Central Cancer Treatment Group, under the direction of Dr. Charles G. Moertel, 
a cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The findings were 
reported in the current Journal of Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can come to you with great confidence and tell you we have a 
treatment of value," said Moertel, who was at the press conference. "I feel any 
patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if they are 
not offered this treatment opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A second, larger study that confirms these findings is expected to be published 
shortly "and provides data to suggest a one-third reduction in the cancer death 
rate at about 3 1/2 years" after surgery, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
This study, also sponsored by the cancer institute, used 1,296 patients between 
1984 and 1987, and, like the earlier study, showed that the two drugs taken in 
combination "reduced recurrence rates, delayed onset of tumor relapse and 
improved disease-free and overall survival for Dukes' C patients," the 
scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that levamisole used alone showed little benefit and that the 
combination therapy has not yet shown any value in other stages of colon 
cancer, or as a treatment for rectum cancer. 
</P>
<P>
5-FU has already shown some benefit in patients with digestive system cancers. 
Levamisole has been used for the past 20 years as a treatment for intestinal 
worms in humans and animals, although it is approved in this country only for 
use in animals. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, at the request of the cancer institute, the Food and Drug 
Administration approved the expanded use of levamisole for treating colon 
cancer under a mechanism known as a "treatment IND," for investigational new 
drug. The designation allows drug developers to release a potentially promising 
drug to desperately ill patients before it has been approved, and while 
research continues. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, made by Paul Janssen Co. of Belgium, will be available to U.S. cancer 
patients free through the National Cancer Institute until the FDA formally 
approves it for use in the treatment of colon cancer. 5-FU was developed by 
Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc. of Nutley, N.J.
