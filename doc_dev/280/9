Former First Lady Nancy Reagan today had a small cancerous tumor removed from 
just beneath her left nostril, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The basal-cell carcinoma was discovered during a routine dermatological 
examination at the Mayo Clinic and was removed by a plastic surgeon at St. 
Marys Hospital, said Mark Weinberg, spokesman for Nancy Reagan and former 
President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital removed Nancy Reagan's left breast 
and adjoining lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was found. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans arrived at the Mayo Clinic on Monday for what Weinberg said were 
routine physical examinations as part of their annual checkups and were found 
in excellent health.
