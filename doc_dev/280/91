   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis W.
Alvarez, a brilliant and wide-ranging scientist who helped develop
the atomic bomb and a theory that asteroids wiped out the
dinosaurs, has died at the age of 77.
   Alvarez, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968 for
his development of the liquid-hydrogen bubble chamber and for the
numerous elementary particles his team discovered using the device,
died late Wednesday at his Berkeley home.
   Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory spokeswoman Mary Barberia quoted
Alvarez's wife, Janet, as saying her husband's health had declined
since he underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor last fall, and
that he died from complications of a series of operations to treat
cancer of the esophagus.
   Alvarez, who did much of his research at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory but also was on the University of California at Berkeley
faculty, was noted not only for physics, but for his work in the
fields of archaeology, paleontology and astronomy
   During World War II, he was credited with inventing a number of
radar systems and an effective bomb sight. He also played a
significant role in developing the atomic bomb during the Manhattan
Project, invented several types of atom smashers and did a personal
analysis of evidence in the 1963 assassination of President John F.
Kennedy.
   But in the last decade, he was catapulted into headlines by the
dinosaur extinction theory he developed with his son, Berkeley
geologist Walter S. Alvarez, and Lawrence Berkeley chemists Frank
Asaro and Helen Michel.
   They argued that asteroids or comets struck the Earth 65 million
years ago, kicking up dust and smoke that blocked enough sunlight
to sharply lower surface temperatures, destroying food plants to
spur mass extinction of dinosaurs and many other species.
   The theory triggered rancorous debate that continues today and
relates to a theory that nuclear warfare would create enough smoke
to plunge Earth into a cold, dark ``nuclear winter'' that would
wipe out survivors of the nuclear exchange.
   While geologists and astronomers tend to support the dinosaur
extinction theory, biologists and fossil experts usually argue that
gradual climate change caused the mass extinction. Others argue
huge volcanic eruptions were responsible, or that asteroids caused
the mass extinction not by blocking sunlight but by triggering
intense acid rain or extreme global warming.
   University of California President David P. Gardner said he was
``personally saddened, as is the entire University of California
community, by the death of Professor Alvarez.''
   ``A creative and energetic scientist, he not only brought
recognition and honor to the university by receiving a Nobel prize,
but he also personally embodied the best of those qualities that
defined his chosen profession _ concern for the student, commitment
to meaningful and distinctive research, and devotion to the
betterment of society,'' Gardner said. `He will be missed.''
   Alvarez, born in San Francisco, was the son of Walter C.
Alvarez, a noted physician and medical columnist at Minnesota's
Mayo Clinic.
   As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Alvarez built
one of the first Geiger counters in the United States, which he
used as a graduate student to discover the East-West effect in
cosmic rays and prove that radiation from space consists mostly of
protons.
   In 1936, he began his work in Berkeley. Among his discoveries
were electron capture by nuclei, the radioactivity of tritium and
the magnetic moment of the neutron.
   He gained public notice for several applications of physics to
popular subjects. He X-rayed an Egyptian pyramid in search of
hidden chambers, only to find there were none. He developed
evidence regarding the assassination of President Kennedy which
supported the findings of the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey
Oswald was the lone assassin.
   In addition to his wife, Alvarez is survived by two sons, two
daughters, two sisters and a brother.
   Arrangements for a memorial service were pending.
