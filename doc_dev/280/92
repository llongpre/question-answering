   President Bush, declaring ``it's time to come
together,'' says he's willing to accept changes by Congress in his
anti-drug program to win broad bipartisan support.
   ``I understand nobody's going to do it exactly my way,'' Bush
said Friday, striking a conciliatory note after earlier lashing out
at critics.
   ``I would be very close-minded if I said you can't have this
change or another or we can't make this part of it better or
another. But this is no time for partisan carping.''
   Critics complain that Bush's $7.9 billion strategy is
under-funded and doesn't go far enough. The program emphasizes
tougher penalties for drug users and more money for jails and law
enforcement, as well as increased funds to attack drugs in countries
where they are produced.
   Bush made his comments in speeches in New Orleans before the U.S.
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the predominantly black National
Baptist Convention USA Inc.
   Bush said there can be differences on some issues, ``but not on
this one, not as our country tries to fight, come up with a national
strategy and then fight the narcotics that are ripping off and
killing the kids of this country, their very soul.''
   ``It's time to come together,'' he said.
   On his return to Washington Friday evening, Bush flew by
helicopter to the presidential retreat at Camp David for the weekend.
   En route to Washington, Bush tried to call former President
Reagan at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. However, Reagan
already was undergoing surgery to relieve an accumulation of fluid
on his brain, a condition doctors say probably resulted when Reagan
was thrown from a horse over the summer.
   ``We're all worried about it,'' Bush said as he awaited word on
the outcome of the surgery. ``I hope it's all right, pray it's all
right _ lovely guy, a lovely person.''
   A Reagan spokesman said after the hour-long surgery that the
operation had been successful and that the 78-year-old former
president was resting comfortably.
   Addressing the Baptists, Bush said the drug crisis and other
problems were related to another serious problem _ ``the decline of
the most basic institution of all, the decline of the American
family.''
   ``We must work together to save the American family,'' he said in
a crusade-like call to give children the love and support that will
prompt them to choose education over the ``easy'' money of crime.
   ``How can you teach respect for a hard-earned dollar when that
easy drug money flourishes out there on the streets?'' he asked as
the audience applauded. ``And how can you persuade young men and
women to have faith in themselves when their mother and dad have
lost all faith?''
   Bush flew to New Orleans a day after a Washington Post-ABC News
poll showed 75 percent of those surveyed approved of his handling of
the drug crisis and 82 percent approved of the proposals he
announced Tuesday.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters that September is the
critical month for the drug campaign as the administration labors to
gain support while Congress is working on the federal budget.
