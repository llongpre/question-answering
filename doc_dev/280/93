   Tailor-made antibodies can dramatically
reverse spreading melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, when
injected directly into the tumors, researchers say.
   The work, though still in its preliminary stages, suggests that
it may be possible to stop the disease by harnessing the body's own
built-in defenses.
   Antibodies are among the body's principal weapons for fighting
off a variety of foreign invaders, including cancer. In this case,
scientists crafted human antibodies in the test tube that were
specifically targeted against the cancer. Then they injected them
into cancerous growths on victims' skin.
   ``The lesions dry up and regress,'' said Dr. Donald Morton,
director of the John Wayne Surgical Oncology Clinic at the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   In initial studies, Morton and colleagues gave the injections to
28 people whose melanoma came back after initial surgery. In 18 of
them, the shots caused partial or complete disappearance of the
growths.
   The doctors injected three different kinds of antibodies. Each
recognizes a different chemical structure that is unique to cancer
cells.
   The antibodies latch onto these chemical structures, marking the
cancer cells for destruction by other patrolling white blood cells.
To the researchers' surprise, they found that the cancer patients
began making more of these antibodies on their own.
   ``We are actually stimulating immunity with this treatment,''
said Morton. ``We don't know why, but it is happening.''
   Morton presented his findings Monday at the annual meeting of
the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   ``I was quite impressed by the response rate,'' commented Dr.
Carol Westbook of the University of Chicago. ``It appears to be a
promising treatment that warrants further investigation.''
   However, Dr. Bruce Cheson of the National Cancer Institute
cautioned that melanoma is particularly hard to study. The course
of the disease can be difficult to predict, and the cancer may go
away for reasons that have nothing to do with the experimental
treatment.
   Melanoma is curable in about 90 percent of cases when it is
caught early. However, it is fatal if it progresses and spreads
throughout the body.
   Melanoma, like other, less dangerous forms of skin cancer, can
result from over-exposure to the sun, and people with light
complexions or irregularly shaped moles are at highest risk.
   An estimated 27,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the United
States this year, and the disease is believed to be increasing at a
rate of 3 percent or 4 percent a year.
   Among other research presented at the meeting:
   _The acne drug Accutane appears to significantly reduce the risk
of second cancers in people who undergo treatment for
smoking-related tumors of the mouth and throat. In a comparison
study on 100 people, Dr. Waun K. Hong of M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston presented evidence that the drug, a synthetic
form of vitamin A, suppresses abnormal growths from turning
cancerous.
   Also on Monday, medical experts advising the Food and Drug
Administration said stronger efforts are needed to make sure women
do not use Accutane during pregnancy because it can cause birth
defects. The advisory committees rejected the advice of some within
FDA who want Accutane withheld from all women to eliminate any risk
of birth defects from the drug.
   _Granulocyte colony stimulating factor, a genetically engineered
substance that speeds up production of white blood cells, can
offset a major side effect of cancer treatment. Often people
receiving chemotherapy must stop their medication because the drugs
lower their blood counts, leaving them open to infection.
   Dr. Jeffrey Crawford of Duke University Medical Center tested
the growth factor on 126 lung cancer patients and found that it
reduced low blood counts and infected-related fever by 44 percent.
   _A study by Dr. Charles G. Moertel and others from the Mayo
Clinic helps doctors handle the dilemma of how to treat colon
cancer patients whose tumors have spread through the bowel wall but
have not visibly invaded the lymph nodes. Since three-quarters can
be saved with surgery alone, doctors are reluctant to offer
chemotherapy.
   The new study found ways of identifying the 25 percent whose
tumors are highly likely to spread. Moertel found that those whose
tumors have unusual genetic characteristics or have perforated the
bowel would probably benefit from chemotherapy.
