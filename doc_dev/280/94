Two prominent eye doctors confirmed Wednesday that President Bush has a mild 
form of glaucoma, but said he need not continue using prescription eye drops. 
</P>
<P>
"Extensive testing of the eye, including detailed photographs, once again 
revealed no abnormalities and no visual loss," said Dr. Burton Lee, the White 
House physician. 
</P>
<P>
"It was decided to stop the Betagan eye drops and follow him closely for now, 
on no treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Other physicians earlier prescribed the drops every 12 hours and said Bush 
would have to use them for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hart, deputy White House press secretary, said the decision to take the 
President off the medication was "simply a difference of opinion" with the 
other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew by helicopter to Bethesda Naval Hospital in nearby Maryland to be 
examined by Dr. Richard Brubaker of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and 
Dr. Harry Quigley of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Both physicians are 
considered to be experts on glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
The President spent about an hour in the hospital. Wearing dark glasses as he 
left, he flashed a thumbs-up sign to reporters as he was driven past in his 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
During his annual checkup on April 12, Bush's physicians found the early-stage 
glaucoma. If untreated, glaucoma can cause gradual impairment of eyesight and, 
at worst, can lead to blindness. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's wife, Barbara, is being treated for double vision and other eye problems 
related to Grave's disease.
