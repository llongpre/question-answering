   The Food and Drug Administration approved a synthetic drug that can prolong the lives of people suffering from certain rare forms of intestinal cancer. 

   The drug, Octreotide Acetate, is traded under the name sandostatin. 
Manufactured by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, N.J., a unit of Sandoz AG, of Switzerland, the drug is a synthetic peptide that mimics somatostatin, a digestive-tract hormone. 
Sandostatin fights severe, life-threatening diarrhea associated with cancers that occur in one or two people per million annually in the U.S. 

   For many patients, the drug "will reduce or eliminate the frequent and devastating bouts of diarrhea that often require repeated hospitalizations for intravenous fluid replacement therapy," said Frank Young, FDA commissioner. 

   In a statement, the agency said that even when the cancers -- malignant carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors -- are found too late to be operable, patients can live as long as 15 to 20 years before succumbing to them. 
"But the diarrhea and associated weight loss can weaken the patients to such a degree that they are confined to wheelchairs, unable to perform the smallest tasks for themselves," it said. 

   The drug works quickly, according to specialists provided by the company. 
"Sandostatin usually stops diarrhea within the first 12-24 hours," said Larry Kvols, a physician at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. 
"The response with other classic symptoms is equally heartening. 
Intense facial flushing clears up, wheezing resolves and within a week or less, physical energy is measurably improved." 

   Side effects of the drug, while minimal according to the studies, include abdominal cramps and nausea. 
Because long-term treatment has led to gallstones in a few patients, the FDA recommends ultrasonic monitoring of patients taking sandostatin. 
The medicine is injected, and patients probably will be taught to administer it themselves. 
The company expects to put the drug on the market later this fall.
