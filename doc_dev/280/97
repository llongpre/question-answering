   Supreme Court Justice William Brennan was
released from the hospital Saturday, less than a week after surgery
to remove his gall bladder, a court spokeswoman said.
   ``He actually has gone home earlier than expected,'' said court
spokeswoman Toni House.
   She said she did not know when Brennan would return to his office
at the court but added that he has been doing some work while in the
hospital.
   Brennan, 82, was taken to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in
suburban Maryland on Dec. 8 for treatment of pneumonia. Doctors
later discovered that Brennan was suffering from gall bladder
disease, which can have symptoms similar to pneumonia.
   Surgery to remove his gall bladder was performed on Monday.
   No malignancy was found in the gall bladder, Ms. House has said.
   Brennan, the court's oldest and most senior member, was last
hospitalized in August 1987 for tests on his prostate gland. The
tests at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., showed he did not have
cancer.
