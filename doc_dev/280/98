   The rate of death and debilitating strokes from
blood vessels that burst in the brain can be significantly reduced
by immediate surgery and boosting patients' blood pressure,
researchers said Thursday.
   A study at Loyola University Medical Center found the two-part
treatment reduced stroke risk for patients with burst brain
aneurysms, which are bubble-like weak points in the brain's blood
vessels.
   The study was published in November's Neurosurgery, the journal
of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.
   Dr. Jack P. Whisnant, a neurological specialist not connected to
the study, said elements of the treatment have been used for some
time, but hadn't been tried together and should be studied further.
   An estimated 5 million Americans have brain aneurysms, and about
28,000 a year suffer ruptures. About half of those suffering
ruptures die within the first month after a vessel bursts, said
Whisnant, chairman of the Mayo Clinic's health sciences research
department.
   The Loyola researchers estimated about a third of patients with
burst aneurysms suffer serious strokes as a result.
   In their study of 43 patients with burst aneurysms, two died and
two others suffered strokes, according to the report issued six
months after the study ended.
   ``We initially found that early surgery for an aneurysm
minimized the risk of further bleeding, but did nothing to prevent
a patient from later suffering a stroke,'' Loyola neurosurgeon Dr.
Thomas Origitano, the study's lead author, said in a telephone
interview on Thursday.
   That early surgery consists of ``clipping'' the aneurysm by
shutting off the leaking blood vessel.
   Early surgery was critical to the two-part treatment's success,
the researchers said.
   Some neurosurgeons traditionally have waited seven to 10 days to
operate after a patient's aneurysm bursts, to see if circulation
will stabilize in the brain, Origitano said.
   Apart from early surgery, Loyola researchers diluted patients'
blood by removing red cells, allowing better circulation within the
brain, they said. They then pumped extra blood into the patients to
increase blood pressure.
   Quicker surgery and blood pressure treatment stabilizes the
brain's blood supply sooner and helps avert strokes, Origitano
said.
   Aneurysm patients run a high risk of stroke for two weeks after
a rupture because the brain's blood vessels fail to regulate
circulation. That allows pressure to drop and deprives the brain of
blood, said Dr. O. Howard Reichman, chief neurosurgeon at Loyola.
   ``If the blood flow falls below a critical threshold, a stroke
can occur,'' Reichman said.
   Of the 43 people in the 2{-year Loyola study, 30 were operated
on within two days of arrival at a hospital. Eight others were
operated on within a week. Five could not undergo surgery because
of unrelated medical conditions, the researchers said.
   Whisnant said elements of the approach taken at Loyola are
commonly used, but not as a comprehensive treatment. Diluting the
blood has been tried, but not necessarily in conjunction with quick
surgery and increasing blood pressure, he said.
   He called the Loyola report interesting, but said a larger study
is needed to determine the success of the approach.
