"Taking Back the Streets," airing at 7:30 tonight on KCET Channel 28, is heavy 
with allusions to war, continually speaking of the battlefield, armies, 
recruiting soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
This is not another PBS documentary on warfare, but the metaphors are 
nonetheless accurate, for the show's focus is on a group called Concerned 
Parents, fighting the battle of their lives against gangs in their communities. 
</P>

Founded in 1978 in response to the "cholo wars" on the Eastside of Los Angeles 
-- there were 24 gang murders that year in the Monte Villa housing project 
where Concerned Parents began -- the group linked mothers of children in 
different gangs for the first time. They formed an underground network -- 
keeping tabs on their children, breaking up the rhythm of the gang kids' life 
on the street. Ten years later, Monte Villa had zero gang-related deaths -- no 
mean feat in Los Angeles' worst year of gang warfare.

Writer-producer Martin Burns devotes most of "Taking Back the Streets" to a new 
group of concerned parents, who were given a small grant by the state to set up 
a program in South-Central Los Angeles. Particularly effective are a segment on 
the group meeting with -- and counseling -- gang members at a California Youth 
Authority facility and a segment that follows a young mother, Joyce Patrick, as 
she searches for her son, Tyrone, a teen-ager who ran away to live on the 
streets with his gang mates.

<P>
Part of the strength of Concerned Parents -- and the documentary -- is that it 
shows parents a way out, a way of fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
"Once one mother gets herself strengthened, then she can help another mother," 
says Eartha Vernon, a member of the South-Central group. "We're gonna have to 
recruit . . . until we get enough mothers that we're ready to walk the whole 
world if necessary."
