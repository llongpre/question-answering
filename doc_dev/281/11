   Jury selection began Monday in the trial of
two people charged with bilking 31,000 lonely men out of more than
$4 million by promising them a paradise called Chonda-Za filled with
naked women.
   Donald S. Lowry, 59, of Bettendorf, Iowa, and Pamala St. Charles,
24, of Moline, Ill., who operated the Church of Love, are charged
with multiple counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy and
unlawful use of fraud proceeds.
   Prosecutors contend letters were sent to prospective male members
telling them of the Church of Love, which they said was founded in
1965 by a teen-age Mexican girl named Maria Simona Mireles.
   The girl, known as ``Mother Maria,'' supposedly lived with young
women known as the ``Angels of Love'' in an old farm building in
northwestern Illinois. The letters said Mother Maria and the Church
of Love wanted to establish a valley paradise to be known as
Chonda-Za, where men could join the Angels, have all their wishes
fulfilled and spend the rest of their lives.
   Men who sent donations received personalized love letters, racy
audio casettes and photos of naked women identified as members of
the secret sect, prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors contend the paradise never existed and that money
they solicited was funneled to the personal use of the church's
founders and their employees.
   Defense attorneys say the organization was nothing more than a
lonely hearts club that provided fantasies for shy men.
   Indictments issued in December charged that Lowry and Ms. St.
Charles, under the guise of their COL Corp., mailed letters to the
men, asking them to send between $20 and $30 for a membership fee.
   The trial before U.S. District Judge Michael M. Mihm is expected
to last several weeks.
