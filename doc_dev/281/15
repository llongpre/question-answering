   ``Colors,'' the much criticized movie about
Los Angeles' out-of-control street gangs, opened nationwide Friday
at 425 theaters amid protests and tight security following
predictions of audience violence.
   It also drew mixed reviews.
   About 15 theaters nationwide dropped plans to show the film,
according to reports, and at some Southern California theaters,
police frisked young people as they entered.
   Afternoon showings went off without incident at the busy
Hollywood Pacific theater. ``It has just been business as usual,''
said manager Michael Schnell.
   The theater added security guards for the film's opening, but
that was more in anticipation of the crowds than out of fear of
violence, Schnell said. The line for an afternoon show snaked a
block down Hollywood Boulevard.
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Huntington Park, police said they
planned to assign at least a dozen officers to the Pacific Warner
Theater. Huntington Park is just a few miles from Watts, home area
of several gangs.
   ``There could be some fights inside the theater,'' said
Huntington Park police Lt. Stan Ramsey. ``We're taking this
seriously. We'll have officers inside the theater and officers
outside.''
   ``There will be gang members there,'' Ramsey said. ``Definitely.
No doubt about it.''
   Between Jan. 1 and April 4, there were 89 gang-related deaths in
Los Angeles County. Last year, there were 387 gang-related deaths
in the area.
   The management of the Laemmle Grand theater near the Sheraton
Grand Hotel, just a short distance from gang turf, decided not to
show the film after staffers pleaded for their safety.
   A United Artists spokesman who asked not to be identified told
the Pomona Progress-Bulletin a decision was made several weeks ago
to pull the movie from some UA theaters, including one in
Montclair, where police in the past two years have staged two major
raids against drugs and gangs.
   Two real Los Angeles gangs, the Crips and Bloods, and their
respective colors of blue and red, are depicted in the movie that
stars Sean Penn and Robert Duvall as two officers assigned to fight
the gangs.
   The Orion movie was directed by Dennis Hopper, who spent the
week defending the film against critics such as the
Hollywood-Beverly Hills Chapter of the NAACP and Los Angeles City
Councilman Nate Holden, who suggested it should not be shown
anywhere.
   ``I'm showing you a real problem that exists,'' Hopper said
Friday on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``When you show a real problem that
exists, you don't go to the City Council and try to get the movie
dismissed.''
   Hopper's home in the Venice area was picketed during the week by
the Guardian Angels, the New York-based civilian crime-fighting
organization.
   The Guardian Angels also handed out pamphlets Friday to
theater-goers at the UA Coronet in the fashionable Westwood section
of Los Angeles, said the Angels West Coast director Scott McKeown.
   ``We are not going to stop anyone from seeing the movie. But we
are going to be exercising our constitutional right to protest
it,'' he said.
   The Angels also set up a picket line in New York City outside
the large Loews Astor Plaza Theater, just off Times Square.
   In Chicago, the founder of a group called Mothers Against Gangs
praised and criticized ``Colors,'' saying adults should see the
film.
   ``A movie has appeared that makes us all witnesses to the daily
horrors of gang wars,'' Frances Sandoval said at a news conference.
The film ``has done what hundreds of pleading, crying and angry
voices of mothers of victims of gang violence could not. It has
drawn national attention to the brutal reality facing our youth.''
   However, she criticized the film for not showing the
after-effects of gang violence. ``When a child is murdered it is
not all over,'' she said. ``It is the beginning of a living
nightmare for the family ... for the mothers.''
   Late Thursday a Chicago Police Gang Crimes Unit patrolman said
all 14 unit officers assigned to the South Side would be instructed
to stick close to a theater showing the movie and would be on
``radio alert,'' ready to help out if any violence were to occur.
The patrolman would not identify himself.
   In Florida, Dade County and city of Miami special units were on
alert but did not expect violence. ``Our gang unit is going to go
to the theater to see the movie, then hang out to identify more
gang members,'' said police spokesman David Rivero. ``But I don't
think they are going to have any incidents.''
   Reviews were mixed, with many critics focusing not on the
violence but on the time-worn ``old-cop, young-cop'' conflict
between Duvall's and Penn's character.
   ``The most shocking thing about the film is not that the movie
glorifies gang violence _ it doesn't _ but that it's about as
conventional as an `Adam-12' episode,'' Los Angeles Herald Examiner
film critic Peter Rainer wrote.
   But The New York Times' Janet Maslin said Hopper ``has a superb
eye for the poisonous flower of gang culture amid ghetto life,''
and noted also that while the movie was accused of glorifying gang
violence ``its sense of frustration is much too strong to support
that claim.''
   Los Angeles Times' critic Sheila Benson called it ``a
disappointingly superficial'' movie.
