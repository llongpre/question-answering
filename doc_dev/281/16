Karen Reed has lived in the Harbor Hills Housing Project in Lomita for 22 
years, raised two daughters there, is close friends with her neighbors and has 
never worried about gangs or crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We sit out here and talk to our neighbors at night, our kids play in the 
streets," Reed said last week as she stood outside her apartment. "You just 
don't do that in infested areas." 
</P>
<P>
So Reed was more than a little surprised when she was handed a copy of a mailer 
that had recently been distributed in the middle-class neighborhood surrounding 
Harbor Hills. The mailer warned that gangs were moving into the 300-unit 
complex, turning it into "a spawning ground and haven for gang-terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
"Gang-terrorists In Harbor Hills County Housing Project!" its headline 
screamed. "Rolling Hills, Lomita and Rolling Ranchos Under Siege!" 
</P>
<P>
The mailer, purportedly put out by a group called the Citizens Anti-Terrorist 
Underground, preached that tax dollars were being used to support "the Crips, 
the Bloods, and other gangs with low-cost housing while they invade and destroy 
your neighborhood and your property values." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . These gangs are GROWING and EXPANDING, overflowing the boundaries of 
South Central Los Angeles, Wilmington and Harbor City and invading peaceful 
communities as far away as Iowa!" the mailer continued. 
</P>
<P>
Just who was responsible for the five-page pamphlet is as anonymous as the 
Manila envelopes in which they were mailed. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona -- the mailer carried a 
Phoenix postmark -- said they have never heard of such a group. A single 
individual could have been behind it, they said. 
</P>
<P>
And just how many mailers were sent out -- they were addressed simply to 
"resident" -- is also unknown. Several homeowners on nearby Hillcrest Avenue, a 
stone's throw away from the complex, said they received a copy; another woman 
who lives a few blocks away said she also got one. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hate mail, that's all it is, hate mail," said Milton Patterson, who 
oversees Harbor Hills for the county's Community Development Commission. ". . . 
I have no tolerance for it." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson and Los Angeles Sheriff's Capt. Dennis Gillard, who heads the Lomita 
station, said they are unaware of any organized gang activity at Harbor Hills, 
a sprawling complex that borders Western Avenue in the southernmost part of 
Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are gang members who live in or visit the complex, and there 
have been narcotic busts there, Gillard said that the more violent gang-related 
activities common in nearby communities such as Harbor City or Wilmington are 
non-existent at Harbor Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the last year, I think we have had more (gang problems) than in the 
past," Gillard said. "But when I say more, we're only talking a half-dozen or 
so incidents, and that is certainly very, very minor compared to the frequent 
daily activities we have elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer prompted only a phone call or two to the Lomita station from 
residents wondering whether its claims were true. "The phone hasn't been 
ringing off the hook. I think a lot of people recognize nonsense when they read 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case with one Lomita man, who requested anonymity. He said his 
mother had received a copy and showed it to him. Neither he nor his mother, who 
has lived in the neighborhood since 1949 without experiencing any crime 
problems, were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a waste of paper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Lomita woman who received the mailer said she was concerned about the type of 
people behind the pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer urged residents to organize into small groups to fight gangs and to 
"carry out in secret those activities to combat gang-terrorism that cannot be 
carried out in mass." The mailer stopped short of advocating violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary to me, it really was," said the woman, who also asked that her 
name not be used. ". . . I'm just as afraid of people like that as I am of the 
gangs. I think they are gangs." 
</P>
<P>
At Harbor Hills, about 10 residents interviewed one day last week appeared more 
bewildered than angered by the mailer's rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Katria Newsome, who was visiting her aunt at the complex, said that compared to 
the South-Central Los Angeles housing project where some of her relatives live 
and where she dreads to visit, Harbor Hills feels like a sanctuary from gangs 
and criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the quietest projects I have ever seen," she said as she tended to 
her two small children. "These are like apartments." 
</P>
<P>
Said Edna Young, who has lived at Harbor Hills for more than 30 years and 
raised five children there, "It's been really good in this project, thank God."
