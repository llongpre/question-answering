   A 16-year-old girl was killed in a new gang
shooting as authorities searched today for a parolee armed with a
Soviet-style assault rifle who is believed to have slain a
6-year-old girl in an act of vengeance.
   The parolee was identified Tuesday as George Carter _ also known
as George Taylor _ one of two men held responsible for spraying a
home with bullets Sunday night, killing Irma Saucedo.
   Her father, Salvador Saucedo, 39, died Tuesday from wounds
suffered in the attack, one of several recently in gang-plagued Los
Angeles neighborhoods.
   The Saucedos were apparently caught in a deadly grudge over a
blue baseball cap, which Irma's 13-year-old brother refused to turn
over to gang members, authorities said.
   The area's most notorious gangs, the Crips and the Bloods,
advertise their affiliation by wearing blue and red respectively,
and wearing the wrong colors on gang turf can prove deadly.
   A stakeout for Carter, 27, was called off late Tuesday after an
anonymous tip that he was seen in an apartment complex proved
unfounded, police said. A $10,000 reward was offered by the county
Board of Supervisors for information leading to conviction of the
killer.
   ``Carter was recently seen in possession of an AK-47-type
weapon,'' Sheriff Sherman Block said, referring to a Soviet assault
rifle favored by gang members rich from drug profits. ``That was
apparently one of the weapons used in this shooting.''
   The identity of the second gunman remained unknown.
   The girl slain Tuesday, 16-year-old Alejandra Melgoza, was
standing with friends on a street corner in suburban Paramount when
shots were fired from a passing Buick, said sheriff's Deputy Leo
Weitzel.
   ``It's just the luck of draw almost whether a young child is
seriously wounded or killed by these cowardly gang members. ...
They just have no value for the life of anyone else,'' said Cmdr.
William Booth, the Police Department's top spokesman.
   Gang violence in Los Angeles County has claimed the lives of at
least 93 people since the beginning of the year, according to
figures collected by the Los Angeles County sheriff's and police
departments.
   Miss Melgoza, who died at a suburban Compton hospital, was
friendly with gang members, the girl's sister Hilda told reporters.
   ``I guess the rest of the gangs knew that my sister was talking
to different gangs and wanted to get revenge or something, I don't
know,'' she told a local radio station.
   Also injured in the Sunday attack was Irma Saucedo's mother,
Maria Hernandez, 39, who remained in critical condition. The girl's
brother and cousin suffered relatively minor wounds.
