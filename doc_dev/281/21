A group of Orange County gang members, riding in a pickup truck and armed with 
automatic assault rifles, opened fire on a Garden Grove family leaving in 
several cars for the movies, killing a 17-year-old rival and a 4-year-old boy 
while wounding six others, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers, who had ventured onto turf controlled by a gang of bitter 
enemies, systematically shot at a dozen people at dusk Saturday outside a home 
in one of the bloodiest gang attacks in Orange County history, police said. The 
victims were preparing to see the movie "Lethal Weapon II." 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Miguel Lorenzo Navarro, 17, a warehouse clerk, and Frank Fernandez 
Jr., 4, whose 23-year-old mother, Irene, 2-year-old brother, Christopher, and 
18-year-old aunt, Inez Fernandez, were among those wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Fernandez and her surviving son were in satisfactory condition Sunday 
night -- the mother at Garden Grove Medical Center and her son at Fountain 
Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Also wounded in the Garden Grove attack were family friends Richard Rendon and 
Anthony Carmona, both 26, and Jennie Hernandez, 21, all of Santa Ana. Inez 
Fernandez, Carmona and Hernandez were treated for minor injuries and released. 
Rendon was in critical condition with leg wounds at the Fountain Valley 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police detectives and gang specialists from Santa Ana and Garden Grove were 
working together in the investigation. They believe members of a Santa 
Ana-based gang, known as 5th Street, carried out the attack, but they had no 
suspects in custody Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Such drive-by shootings are relatively rare in Orange County, where gangs are 
growing but thus far have not resorted to the kind of violence associated with 
the large gangs of South-Central Los Angeles, where children increasingly have 
become victims of shootings. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night along the 13800 block of La Bonita Avenue, less than a block 
from Santa Ana city limits in a working class neighborhood of second- and 
third-generation Mexican-Americans, a 30-year-old feud between two gangs was 
played out against a backdrop of what police say has been increasing activity 
and unrest among Santa Ana-area gangs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Never Forget' 
</P>
<P>
Residents have spotted gang members cruising the street in recent months but 
said there had been nothing to foreshadow the violent outburst Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be surprised if anyone sleeps on this street for a long time," said Ruth 
Macias, a La Bonita resident since the 1940s who lives three doors from where 
the shooting began. "You never forget the popping of the guns. Never." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Navarro was the primary target because he was a member of the 17th 
Street gang, which was blamed by the rival 5th Street gang for a recent 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The dark-colored pickup truck turned onto the 13800 block of La Bonita Avenue, 
across from a Pentecostal church, as members of the Fernandez family, several 
relatives and friends talked and laughed in front of a tiny stucco house. The 
late-model pickup rolled slowly by with the windows down and the occupants' 
guns blazing, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of gunfire were quickly replaced by screams and cries for help as 
the street and sidewalk were littered with bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 20 rounds were fired by the attackers who obviously had no 
concern about who their gunfire would harm," Garden Grove Police Sgt. Dan Lyons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors who had gathered outside to chat or share a beer on the muggy night 
scattered as the bullets riddled several homes and cars along a 50-yard stretch 
of La Bonita Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
One man was under his car, working on his transmission, when the gunfire 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"I just clutched my wrench and started praying," said Rodolfo Zepeda. "I just 
hugged the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, known as Smokey to his gang brothers, was sitting in the back seat of 
a black Nissan sedan parked on the street, police and witnesses said. When the 
shooting started, he lunged for the front seat, throwing his body over a 
terrified Inez Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Had a Chance' 
</P>
<P>
"If he hadn't shielded me, I would have been dead," said Fernandez, who was 
slightly injured when her neck was grazed by an errant bullet. "The truck was 
less than 20 feet away. Mike never had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's 4-year-old nephew, Frank Jr., was shot several times as he stood in 
the back of another car parked in the family's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Sr. had just taken his family to his mother's La Bonita Avenue house 
after an outing at a nearby park. They had gone there to meet the others, who 
were grabbing coats and sweaters for the regular Saturday night outing at a 
drive-in. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's wife was driving, and had left the engine running in the gray 
sedan, believing they would be stopped no more than a minute or two. Irene 
Fernandez, in an interview from the hospital, said she was about to back the 
car out, her three children in the back seat, when the bullets started flying. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like something big and fast," said Frank Fernandez, who described 
himself as a former gang member. "Everybody (outside the car) was yelling, 'Get 
down! Get down!' I tried to put everybody down, but my little boy was standing 
up in the back and he got shot through the chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was crying," he recalled. "My sister opened the back door and said, 
'Frankie's shot. . . .' I took my son in the car and drove to the hospital. I 
wasn't gonna wait for no ambulance. My first priority was my son." 
</P>
<P>
The assault, police said, was carried out by members of the 5th Street gang, 
decades-old rival of the 17th Street gang, in retaliation for a shooting 
several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Youths who identified themselves as members of the 17th Street gang denied any 
involvement in the earlier incident, and said Saturday night's shooting was 
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Are Rules' 
</P>
<P>
Chris Lovato, a 17th Street gang member, said he was on the phone talking with 
a friend at the Fernandez house when he heard someone yell through the 
receiver, "I've been hit! I've been hit!" He ran two blocks to the shooting 
scene to find his best friend, Navarro, bleeding profusely. 
</P>
<P>
"There are rules, and one of them is you don't shoot at women and children," 
Lovato said. 
</P>
<P>
The hows and whys mattered little to Navarro's mother, Micki Camacho, who wept 
softly Sunday while holding a picture of her son, "Mikey." 
</P>
<P>
"I tried and tried to get him to quit the gang," she said. "But he wouldn't 
listen. He said it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, his mother recounted, had been a gang member since he was 13. In 1986, 
the handsome, dark-haired teen-ager had been shot in the stomach as he stood 
outside his mother's house in another apparent gang incident. He was not 
seriously wounded, and a week later, she said, he began a 2 1/2-year sentence 
in a California Youth Authority facility for possession of a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, I felt better he was there than on the streets," Camacho said 
outside her Santa Ana home Sunday. "On the streets, I worried all the time. I 
used to spend night after night searching for him. I told him: 'This only leads 
to one thing, death.' " 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Navarro was freed and returned to live with his mother and 
younger brother and sister. Camacho said Navarro constantly warned his 
5-year-old brother not to get involved with gangs. "It's bad business. No 
good," she overheard him say. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro had even shown signs of mending his ways and "going straight," Camacho 
said. He had just begun a new job as a warehouse clerk and purchased his first 
car. Saturday night, Navarro said he would be home by 8 p.m., the curfew 
imposed by his mother. Camacho had gone to the video store to rent some movies 
that she and her son could watch when he returned. 
</P>
<P>
He was killed about 7:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It just rips families apart," she said as her 6-year-old daughter Esmeralda 
hugged her waist. "When will it stop?"

A pickup truck carrying several people suspected of belonging to the 5th Street 
gang in Santa Ana drove into a Garden Grove neighborhood Saturday evening and 
opened fire on several members of the Fernandez family and their friends. 
Police believe the target of the assault was a man who reportedly belonged to 
the rival 17th Street gang of Garden Grove.
