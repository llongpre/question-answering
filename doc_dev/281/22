Inglewood police were still searching Saturday for a 19-year-old man described 
as "armed and extremely dangerous" who they said is the suspect in the rape and 
shooting one week ago of a 14-year-old girl, her mother and another woman, who 
died two days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The mother and daughter, who are still in a hospital, told police that their 
attacker is a youth they had seen hanging out near their home on Doty Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the suspect as J. C. Metoyer, who goes by the nicknames "Man 
Man" and "May May." The Inglewood Police Department asked for the public's 
assistance in finding Metoyer, who they believe is still in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred June 3 in the neighborhood south of the Hollywood Park race 
track in a home that the 33-year-old mother shared with her daughter, a 
19-year-old woman and two younger children. 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer, who has no permanent residence, often visited his grandmother, who 
lived on Doty Avenue, said Inglewood police Sgt. Harold Moret. 
</P>
<P>
About 1 a.m. on June 3, Metoyer approached the 19-year-old woman in front of 
her home, pushed a small-caliber pistol into her back and ordered her inside 
the house, Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that once Metoyer was inside the house, he tied the hands of the 
two women and a 14-year-old girl, raped all three and then shot each at least 
once in the head. The suspect fled with a pillowcase filled with valuables. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old woman died Tuesday morning at Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center from a wound behind one ear. The two other victims are expected 
to survive, but the girl has lost the sight in her left eye after a bullet 
struck her there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Gangs 
</P>
<P>
Police said Metoyer has been affiliated with several different gangs and bears 
a scar on his stomach after being shot last year by a gang rival. Metoyer is 
described as 6-foot-1 to 6-foot-3, 180 pounds with a shaved head. 
</P>
<P>
He has lived in Compton and south Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Metoyer is also suspected of firing shots in late May at a 
15-year-old who was riding a bicycle through the same Inglewood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fellow who is out of control," Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents on Doty Avenue said they have not seen Metoyer recently, but 
the fear in the neighborhood is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman Frightened 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a woman told two maintenance men who appeared suddenly outside her 
window that they had frightened her. "Don't you know these women were shot just 
over here!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors fear reprisals if they talk about Metoyer, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this neighborhood are afraid," she said. "Why would they say 
anything, even if they knew where he was." 
</P>
<P>
Police said callers can give them information about Metoyer anonymously by 
calling 412-5210 or 412-5246.
