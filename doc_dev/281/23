<HEAD>Woman Sentenced For Using Morgue Body To Fake Own Death</HEAD>

   A woman who tried to fake her own
death by using an unclaimed corpse from the morgue has been
sentenced to two years in prison for falsely claiming a body.
   Among the many flaws investigators found in the scheme were the
fact the defendant weighed 65 pounds less than the corpse and
lacked its tattoos.
   Sandra P. Hall, 35, who is halfway through a four-year probation
term for welfare fraud, was sentenced Thursday in Los Angeles
County Superior Court for falsely obtaining an unclaimed body. She
had pleaded no contest to the charge.
   Her mother, Helen M. Tilch, 59, of the Los Angeles suburb of San
Fernando, has pleaded no contest to similar charges for helping Ms.
Hall in the scheme and faces a possible prison sentence.
   Deputy District Attorney Janice L. Maurizi contended the women
concocted the scheme to elude probation officers and creditors. Ms.
Hall, who told authorities she got the idea from a television
program, said she was trying to escape from an abusive ex-husband.
   ``The people you are dealing with here have been involved in
schemes all their lives,'' said Los Angeles police Detective
Stephen Fisk.
   Ms. Hall, who lives in Tulare County, and her mother obtained
the remains of Jane Doe No. 70, an unidentified, partly decomposed
body at the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.
   Identifying herself as Sharon J.T. Agee, Ms. Hall claimed that
the corpse was her sister, Sharon P. Hall. Her mother backed up the
story.
   After having the body cremated, they sent a copy of the death
certificate to probation officials.
   A probation officer reviewing the alleged death noticed the
physical discrepancies while reading the autopsy report, and
contacted police. Jane Doe No. 70 weighed 195 pounds to Ms. Hall's
130, and the corpse also had numerous tattoos.
   Further checks found the fingerprints from the body were
different from Ms. Hall's.
