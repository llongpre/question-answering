The sound of women wailing came out of the small yellow stucco house in East 
Los Angeles on Monday morning. A family birthday party had become a family 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, Maria Navarro's estranged husband, Raymond, 26, had burst 
into her birthday party uninvited and started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Now Maria, 27 to the day, was dead. Her aunt Francisca was dead. Elderly aunt 
Maria was dead. The close friend they called aunt Leticia was dead. Aunt Berta 
was in the hospital, barely alive. 
</P>
<P>
Maria's three children and their cousins had witnessed murder. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, brothers and grown nephews poured gallons of bleach onto the driveway, 
trying to scrub away the blood with brooms. Not satisfied, they added detergent 
until suds flowed down the driveway pure and white. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Family 
</P>
<P>
At last, the stains were gone. But the fabric of a large and close family had 
been torn. For 25 years, despite the fact that part of the family had lived in 
Mexicali and part had lived in Los Angeles, they had remained extremely close. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, relatives arrived at the modest home in the 3600 block of Lanfranco 
Street from both sides of the border. For several hours, all they knew was that 
four women were dead and one was barely alive. But, in the confusion, they 
didn't know who. All they knew was that no matter how it turned out, there 
could be no sighs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Porque? Porque? (Why? Why?)" cried Delia Fajardo when she arrived in Los 
Angeles from Mexicali Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she screamed: "Mi hija! Mi hija! (My daughter! My daughter!)" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps none lost more than Delia Fajardo. She was the mother of the slain 
young woman, the niece of the two elderly women who were dead, Maria Garcia, 
69, and Francisca Arizpe, 62, and sister to Berta Galvan, 47, who was in 
critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. Another woman who was so close 
to them all that they called her tia, or aunt, Leticia M. Dipp, 47, was also 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Francisca and Berta were not married, relatives said. Neither, they said, was 
Dipp, whom the family had adopted as one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Berta was like a second mother to Maria," said Fajardo, who spoke briefly to a 
reporter about her daughter before collapsing in tears. "I had always asked 
Berta to look after Maria." 
</P>
<P>
And Berta did. Especially after Maria Navarro had separated from her husband in 
early 1988, following complaints that he had physically abused her. Berta would 
stop by the house asking if there was anything Maria and the children needed. 
Often, she gave them money. 
</P>
<P>
They worked together too, along with Leticia Dipp, at the Plaza del Sol 
shopping center in East Los Angeles. Dipp was manager of the shopping center. 
Maria, in recent months, worked two jobs to make more money for her three 
children, Claudia, 7, Denise, 6, and Raymond Jr., 5. Berta wore a security 
guard's uniform but never carried a gun, co-workers said. 
</P>
<P>
The three women were strong and strong-willed, merchants and employees at the 
shopping mall said Monday as they tried to absorb the shock of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
"The three women ran the place," said Carmen Cortez, an administrator at the 
Latino Immigration Service. "We feel lost without them. They would help 
everyone. They were strong ladies. . . . Those ladies weren't afraid of 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Maria was pretty, the kind of young woman whom strong aunts felt they needed to 
protect, particularly from her jealous husband, friends and relatives said. 
They described Raymond as jealous and abusive, a man who prided himself on his 
weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High School Sweethearts 
</P>
<P>
He had married his Roosevelt High School sweetheart. A few years ago, friends 
said, Maria had been a contestant in the Miss Primavera contest in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, she had come to fear her husband. Her aunt Berta grew more 
protective. 
</P>
<P>
"Berta used to come with her because they were afraid of him," said Carlos 
Hernandez, owner of Sandwich Express at the shopping center. Maria worked from 
about 4 a.m. to noon at International Tour Service, a shuttle bus line between 
Los Angeles and Tijuana, as a receptionist. After she got off that job, she 
would go to work as an assistant to her aunt Leticia. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said Berta had told him she came to work at 4 a.m. with her niece 
because they were afraid of her husband. Once, he said, Raymond Navarro had 
followed her upstairs at the mall, kicking her. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her (Maria) once, 'Why don't you leave him?' " he said. He said she 
answered: " 'Because if I leave him, he would kill me.' That's what she told me 
about six, seven months ago."
