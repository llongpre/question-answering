Marvin Feldman says that when he heard the radio news report, he felt "like 
someone had hit me in the stomach." 
</P>
<P>
A man had broken into a home near Hollywood Park race track in Inglewood, raped 
two women and a girl, then shot each several times as they lay bound on the 
floor. A 19-year-old victim died, but her 32-year-old house mate and the older 
woman's daughter, 14, survived. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, a Van Nuys public relations consultant, did not know any of the 
victims, but he had a chance meeting with a friend of the murdered woman a few 
days after the June 3 attack and decided: "Let's do something." 
</P>
<P>
The result was formation of a group called Help Each Life Please, which so far 
has collected $4,500 in donations for the mother and daughter and for the dead 
woman's two orphaned children. 
</P>
<P>
HELP has also recruited a doctor, Santa Monica ophthalmologist Marshall J. 
Keyes, who will donate his services to help the teen-ager, who lost an eye in 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect, J. C. Metoyer, 19, was arrested in the Crenshaw District a week 
after the attack. The reputed gang member is scheduled to face a preliminary 
hearing next Friday in Los Angeles Municipal Court on 11 felony charges, 
including murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then I just sit and think, 'Why?' " the surviving mother said in 
a telephone interview. "I think, "Why me and why my daughter?' " She is living 
with her four children at a friend's house in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo Bank at 400 S. Market St. in Inglewood is collecting the donations.
