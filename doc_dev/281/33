After leaving the secure atmosphere of elementary school, what happens to 
Cambodian refugee children as they prepare to enter an adult world? Some simply 
trade war zones -- from the killing fields of Cambodia to the Asian gang wars 
of Van Nuys. Most find that adjusting to greater social freedoms in the United 
States, such as dating and extended friendships, depends upon their parents' 
attitudes toward those freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not supposed to have a boyfriend," said Pinthang Ouk, a sophomore at Grant 
High School in Van Nuys who entered Hazeltine Avenue School when she was 6. "In 
our way, if a guy likes you, your parents have to watch after you and stuff 
until you get married. If you go out with different boyfriends before you get 
married, it means you're not a real virgin -- even if you just go out on a 
date." 
</P>
<P>
Pinthang, 15, lives in the Vallerio Gardens apartment complex in Van Nuys with 
her mother, aunt, grandmother and two sisters. Six concrete buildings at the 
complex house about 300 Cambodians, who are packed 10 to 15 each into 
two-bedroom apartments. Central courtyards harbor fledgling gardens where 
scores of children play, spilling out into an alley that dissects the 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Pinthang said she agrees with her mother's and grandmother's attitudes about 
dating. "It's hard, because I can't usually go out with my friends -- my mom 
wants me around the house," she said. "But I wouldn't want to hang around a lot 
of girls who flirt and stuff. I want to stick with the girls who are just like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Pinthang said traditional Cambodian dance, which she learned in Phnom Penh, 
where she was born, helps her through adolescence. She now dances with a local 
troupe at festivals and schools. "My grandma's mother was a dancer in the 
temples for royalty in Cambodia," she said. "So now, when I dance, it's like 
generation to generation, we're passing the tradition down." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school, Pinthang is thinking of becoming a flight 
attendant or a "lady cop." 
</P>
<P>
"But my mom told me to forget it," she said, flipping the pages of "Dynamic 
Anatomy and Physiology" while her two younger sisters took turns combing her 
shoulder-length hair. "She said to work in an office or something. My grandma 
said that too. They want to keep me safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go to college, but my grandma doesn't want me to go. She doesn't 
think a girl needs that much education. Only guys do. I don't agree with her. 
I'm going to go anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Roatha Buth, 18, lives next door to Pinthang with his mother, an aunt, five 
sisters and three brothers. He was kicked out of 10th grade at Van Nuys High 
School earlier this year and later spent one month in juvenile hall for 
attempting to break into a car, a charge he denies. Roatha Buth has no plans to 
return to school, often thinks of getting a job as a fast-food cook in San 
Bernardino, where he has friends, and sometimes dreams of becoming a 
firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first come here, the gangs make me fight," he said, smoothing his 
T-shirt, emblazoned with a Corona beer label. His thick, black hair was pulled 
back with a blue rubber band and around his neck hung three gold chains, one 
sporting a dime-size Mercedes-Benz symbol. "Like they hit you up. They go, 
'Where you from?' I didn't know or understand who they were. First there were 
Mexican gangs, then Asian gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Roatha Buth said he was a member of the Asian Boys gang for two years when he 
was 14 and 15. "They jump you in, they jump you out," he said, describing the 
initiation process. "When they jump you in, three of them start to hit you and 
you got to hit back for 30 seconds. And then you start hanging around them. I'd 
rather be a fireman. Lots of action. But you have to graduate and all that from 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
Roatha Buth's immediate concern is his living arrangements. His mother recently 
told him he must leave the house unless he gets a job. "I just want to get out 
of this apartment," he said, glancing at a corner Buddhist altar laden with 
incense, mostly hidden by a towering ensemble of audio equipment. "I want to go 
somewhere far away. Too much trouble. Screaming, crying, arguments. Even Maria, 
my girlfriend, screams at me. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go nowhere. You can't get out of this place. Only like in Beverly 
Hills it's quiet, I think. There are no gangs over there. Or if you lived in a 
house, it would be quiet then, I think." R. DANIEL FOSTER
