   Weekend shootings that claimed 13 lives
forced police to deploy extra officers in one area and caution
against ``unrealistic expectations'' today at a second summit aimed
at ending gang warfare.
   Ten of the deaths were gang-related, police said. Three other
people were killed and one was critically wounded in three separate
shootings late Sunday night, but police said the three deaths
didn't appear to be gang-related.
   At least 17 other people were wounded in the shootings, police
said.
   The deaths of four people in three shootings in the
Harbor-Wilmington area south of downtown Los Angeles prompted
police to send extra officers Sunday to back up the usual force and
visit parents of reputed gang members, police said.
   Community leaders and clergy members, meanwhile, prepared to
bring warring gang members face-to-face today at a Los Angeles
church sharing a street corner with drug peddlers.
   A highly publicized round of similar talks last month led to
some job offers for gang members, but no end to the violence that
has claimed an average of one life a day in Los Angeles County.
Police cautioned people to keep their expectations low.
   ``Everybody is standing back and waiting for the seas to part
and all crime to fall between the cracks,'' said Los Angeles Police
Cmdr. William Booth. ``Those were unrealistic expectations that
were fanned really too much.''
   In the latest attack in the Harbor area, one woman was killed
and another wounded early Sunday morning in the parking lot of a
housing project, said Los Angeles police Sgt. James Allen. William
Oswald, 35, was booked Sunday in connection with the death of
Sherry Lytle, police said.
   A few hours earlier and a few blocks away, a gunman in a white
pickup truck shot a 30-year-old man, who later died at a hospital,
Allen said.
   Late Saturday night in the same area, two pedestrians _ a
16-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man _ were killed and four
others, including an apparently innocent bystander, were wounded in
a gang-related drive-by shooting, police said.
   One man was killed and two injured in a gang-related attack late
Sunday night in an area of South Central Los Angeles known for
narcotics sales, Sgt. Lee Bradford said.
   In southeast Los Angeles, an unidentified youth was killed
Saturday night in a gang-related shooting, said Lt. Doug Young.
   In nearby Riverside County, two 26-year-old men were fatally
shot early Saturday while sitting on the balcony at a condominium
complex 55 miles east of Los Angeles, said police Sgt. Mike Wilson.
   A 19-year-old man was fatally shot early Saturday while driving
to visit his mother in Compton, police said. The shooting occurred
in a known gang hangout, but authorities said they knew of no
motive for the crime.
   The same assailants were believed responsible for two shootings
Friday night in Inglewood that claimed the life of one teen-ager
and wounded two others, said Sgt. Ron Jackson.
