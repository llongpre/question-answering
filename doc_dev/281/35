   Drive-by shooters killed a young girl and
wounded four family members in a gang-infested neighborhood as
violence continued despite a police crackdown.
   A gunman got out of a car and fired up to 30 bullets into a home
in the unincorporated east Compton area Sunday night, killing the
6-year-old girl as she watched television with her family in the
living room, authorities said.
   ``Her mother and her father were badly wounded, and so were her
13-year-old brother and her 4-year-old brother,'' sheriff's Deputy
Hal Grant said.
   Authorities had not determined whether gangs were involved in
the attack, but it took place in a grafitti- and bullet-pocked area
that is home to street thugs, Deputy Roger Hom said.
   In another weekend attack, James Conrad Voldseth, 28, of Los
Angeles, was stabbed to death by two gang members during a drug
deal in the San Fernando Valley community of Pacoima, police said.
   The attacks came at the end of a generally quiet weekend of gang
activity. Feared violence associated with the release of the movie
``Colors,'' about Los Angeles street gangs, also failed to
materialize.
   On Saturday night, a 200-member police task force in Los Angeles
fanned out and arrested 147 people, 73 of whom were suspected gang
members, authorities said.
   Police and sheriff's deputies kept up a presence at theaters in
the Los Angeles area showing ``Colors.''
   Unruly crowds at a theater in Colma in Northern California and
at one in San Diego led to cancellation of the film at those
theaters. At the film's opening Friday, minor scuffles prompted 13
arrests in the Los Angeles area.
