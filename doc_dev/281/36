<LEADPARA>  A late '60s Chevy convertible roars down Atwood Drive in East San Jose,
screeching to a halt where the street comes to a dead end and some teen-agers
are hanging out.;   A young man leaps out of the car and fires shots at a boy
and girl, who fall mortally wounded. The car then speeds away while parents
run out of houses screaming, and an ambulance arrives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The shooting was filmed Wednesday, one of four 30-second anti-drug,
anti-gang TV spots being produced by Victory Outreach, a Christian church of
about 700 mostly Hispanic members who meet in hotel ballrooms.;   After the
shooting, Ed Morales, the church pastor who also drives the convertible in the
commercial, comes on screen with a message: "If you're not in this, don't get
in it. Play football, go to college, become a lawyer, anything. Just don't get
into this.";   The production, paid for with $25,000 in donations from church
members, is being filmed by West Coast Teleproductions of Los Angeles.
Director Paul Fabian is a 31-year veteran of Hollywood-produced TV programs
such as "Mr. Novak," " Gomer Pyle" and "I Spy." Half of the production crew
members and cast came from Los Angeles; the other half are amateur volunteers
from the church group.;   Airing the spots on Bay Area TV will cost another
$25,000. One depicts the funeral of a victim of a gang fight over drugs.
Another, which emphasizes that drug abuse is a multicultural problem, depicts
"some yuppies in an office" snorting cocaine, Morales said.;   A fourth spot
is aimed at ethnic stereotypes. It simply lines up several Hispanic youths
dressed alike in red and blue gang colors. The youths are not gang members;
they simply like the colors.;   "My goodness, look what it has coming down to
-- if you wear red and blue, you're a gang member," said director Fabian.;  
Wednesday's phony drive-by shooting was all too real to some spectators. Maria
Arostigui, 31, married and a mother, said she was known as "Little Mary" Perez
when she was 16 and a member of a South San Jose gang.;   "For two years I was
into gang fighting and confrontations with police," she said. "I hung around
with people who carried weapons, and I was addicted to drugs.";   When she
wanted out, she thought there was no escape, she said.;   "I was in despair,
entrapped with no way out," she said. "The end result was going to be death.
My dad was actually shot by a rival gang in a drive-by shooting at my house,
and my grandmother's house next door and my brother's car were shot up.;  
"And I was stabbed.";   Little Mary eventually did find a way out, however.
Her way was the church. Others may find different paths, she said, adding that
the TV spots won't preach. They will, however, have a strong fundamentalist
Christian approach.;   They'll also offer a toll-free number where people can
get peer and professional counseling, and information on such things as drug
rehabilitation and job counseling.  </TEXT>
