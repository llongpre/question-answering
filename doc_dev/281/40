   The gunfire comes from a passing car,
exploding just after the shouted gang slogans _ battle cries on the
urban killing fields where the medics move in to pick up the pieces.
   In the darkness, sometimes with the gunmen still looking on from
the sanctuary of a gathering crowd, the paramedics move in.
   They ignore red and blue gang colors and tattoos, tending wounds
sometimes reminiscent of war, radioing ahead to an emergency room
already overcrowded with the city's poor. There, an ER doctor will
treat yet another victim of the violence that claimed 351 lives in
Los Angeles County last year.
   Suburban counties are beginning to mount their own tolls.
   For Los Angeles County fire paramedics like Mike Siefert and Joe
Kinney the victims and shootings blur together. Only the most brutal
stand out.
   For Siefert, that was a bloody morning at Gage and Rugby avenues
in Huntington Park, a primarily Hispanic suburb where downtown
highrises loom in the distance like mirages of prosperity. The
attack was retaliatory. The victim was the mother of a gang member,
shot in the stomach with a shotgun.
   ``They assassinate one another,'' Siefert said.
   Sometimes the killers don't flee, forcing paramedics to work
under the eye of gang toughs who Kinney said often ``walk right back
up and watch; see if they killed them or not.'' Sometimes paramedics
must watch victims bleed, waiting until police secure the area.
   The Los Angeles City Fire Department will not even allow its
paramedics to be interviewed for fear that the attention will put
them at risk.
   In the heart of the violence is Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew
Medical Center, near Watts amid neighborhoods claimed by the Bloods
and Crips black street gangs.
   The most common operation at the hospital is an exploratory
laparotomy, to repair damage from a gunshot wound. In 1986, there
were 754 such operations _ nearly four times the number of
appendectomies, said Dr. Arthur Fleming, chairman of surgery.
   ``You give it your 102 percent and you patch them up and you send
them out to start the vicious cycle all over again,'' said Brenda
Allmond, the hospital's trauma nurse coordinator.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates has likened street warfare to conflicts
in Lebanon, Northern Ireland and South Africa. With attackers here
favoring Uzi submachineguns and AK-47 assault rifles, those on the
front line know the references to war are not so far-fetched.
   ``The trauma is exactly the same,'' said Kinney.
   Doctors say they see more shotgun and small-caliber handgun
wounds than those from Uzis. But they don't diminish the violence.
   ``They'll say to you if their loved one dies, `You're going to
get more business tonight' ... and the retaliation sets in,'' Ms.
Allmond said.
   Gang members 10 at a time have stormed emergency room doors at
King to get to the wounded. ``There were times the gang members
walked in ER and our doctors were shaking in their boots,'' said
Fleming.
   The violence did not always rate front-page headlines and
top-of-the-hour newscasts. But on Jan. 30, 1988 Karen Toshima _ a
27-year-old Long Beach woman who could have been anyone from the
comfortable suburbs _ was slain by gang crossfire while strolling
through Westwood, the upscale district of shops, restaurants and
theaters near the University of California, Los Angeles.
   With that began Los Angeles' 1,000-officer task force nicknamed
``The Hammer,'' which rounded up hundreds of reputed gang toughs;
the so-called gang summits with local ministers that brought a call
for jobs but no end to the shootings; and the ``city under seige''
news stories.
   Fleming, a former military man, says the solution is a job corps,
combining work and discipline for gang members. But he believes
police sweeps have had some success quelling violence.
   The day after a weekend sweep that netted 870 arrests, ``we had
one death in one 17-year-old and other than that it was relatively
quiet.'' The teen who died bore the MSC tattoo, initials of the Main
Street Crips. He was slain by a bullet that clipped the main vessel
leading into the bottom of the heart.
   Hundreds survive the violence. Some come to Rancho Los Amigos
Medical Center in suburban Downey for rehabilitation.
   In the hallway, Dr. Lance Stone, director of the adult brain
injury unit, passes a zombie-like young man, who shuffles slowly,
eyes focusing loosely when Stone says hello. The man was a bystander
to a gang fight. Bullet fragments hit him in the arm and head,
leaving him with nerve injury and extreme pain. He had been
attending college; now he can write, but no longer knows how to read.
   Stone estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of his patients bear
gang-related injuries. Dr. Douglas Garland, director of the spinal
cord injury unit, where the primary cause of injury is gunshot
wounds, puts the number near 35 percent.
   These men have seen patients unable to move because of
gang-related injuries, patients who will need wheelchairs the rest
of their lives, but still retain gang affiliations.
   ``We've had patients who have refused a red or a blue
wheelchair,'' said county social worker Wendy Ross.
   Ms. Ross' one ``success story'' is an 18-year-old who was shot
during his gang initiation about two years ago. The gang provided
the target, and Ms. Ross believes it was a setup. The target was an
undercover policeman, who drew his weapon and shot the boy, leaving
him without the use of his legs. The teen-ager has earned his high
school diploma, moved into his own place and is starting community
college. He wrote to thank Ms. Ross for her friendship and help in
beginning a life without his legs. Then added, ``But if that is what
it cost for me to change my ways and find good friend it worth it.''
   For others, there are few bright spots.
   Dr. Joe Morales, director of emergency admitting at Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center, sees more than a dozen gang victims, most
under the age of 25, come through hospital doors each week.
   ``If they're 7 or 8, we assume they're innocent,'' Morales said.
``Otherwise we lose all hope.''
