<LEADPARA>  PICTURE it: this highbrow-looking white lady from Pasadena with a man's name,
great cheekbones and a puffy dog nicknamed the Woofster driving around
South-Central Los Angeles scouting out "homeboys.";   "I speak
African-American gangbanger," says writer Leon Bing, so eventually these
members of the Crips and Bloods gangs confide in her.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They're kids like Faro, 17, homeless, proficient with an AK-47. He tells
her how he ambushed a rival gang member and his family because they strayed
into Faro's neighborhood.;   "I killed him -- shot his baby in the leg --
crippled his wife. She in a wheelchair now, I heard, wearing a voice-box,
'cause one of the bullets caught her in the throat. The baby OK.;   "I just
lit his whole family up and . . . It was like, damn, Cuz -- I killed him, that
was my mission, but still -- his whole family.";   Faro's mother died of a
drug overdose. His grandmother is a "cluckhead," or crack addict. His brother
died in a holdup at age 8. Faro figures he'll die, too.;    "I tell you this
-- you see enough dying, then you be ready to die yourself, just so you don't
have to see no more death.";   For four years Leon Bing -- she was named after
her grandfather -- repeatedly entered the teen-age gang world inhabited by
Faro, G-Roc, Bopete and others. The result is "Do or Die," published by
HarperCollins ($19.95).;   The New York Times calls it "a poignant, sometimes
chilling record of conversations with hard-core gang members.";   A Los
Angeles Times critic writes: "What makes 'Do or Die' a fascinating book, and a
frightening chronicle of Los Angeles' gang life, is the way the author slowly
strips away social and psychological veneers to reach fundamental truths about
some aspects of life in America. Those truths are very, very scary.";   "This
is the human face behind tragic headlines," writes Digby Diehl in Playboy. "A
sad, honestly reported story of kids at war with themselves.";   "A book that
should be read by everyone professionally involved or personally concerned
with the future of urban America," notes Publishers Weekly. "This highly
disturbing work marks the debut of a gifted writer with extraordinarily keen
reportorial instincts.";   Bing, a high-fashion model in the 1960s, became a
writer only five years ago, and developed an affinity for hard-luck kids.;  
She has written free-lance articles for LA Weekly about runaways and other
teen-agers living in abandoned buildings in Venice, and about the children of
wealthy, well-insured Westside residents being placed in psychiatric hospitals
for "acting like teen-agers.";   "No one ever really stops and asks kids what
they think about things," she says. "They're very rarely asked, 'Well, what's
your opinion of this?' And whether the opinions are informed or uninformed,
they're usually really interesting.";   Bing was drawn to gangbangers because,
"I wanted to put faces on these kids, on what people said was a social
problem, so you can see why 9- and 10-year-old kids turn into hardened
criminals by the time they're 14 or 15.";   The question Bing is always asked
is, "Weren't you scared?" Translation: What white woman in her right mind
would go deep into drug territory populated by tough black kids looking for
"homies," as the gang members call one another.;   Bing's answer cuts right to
the heart of her position: "I wasn't afraid; they weren't looking to hurt me.
They were real people, real kids. Please don't confuse them with pit bulls."; 
 Another part of the book's strength is that Bing not only talks directly to
the gang members but also to parents, parole officers, police officials and
juvenile-detention counselors about the grinding poverty, cutbacks in social
programs and racial prejudice that contribute to gang activity.;   Brotherhood
and brutality; In an incident from the book, a Crip catches a rival homeboy
talking to his sister, so he beats him up, drags him behind a car, then throws
him into a pen with two pit bulls.;   In another scene from the book, a
homeboy buys a pit bull, and, cradling it and cooing to it, immediately takes
the dog to a vet for $40 worth of shots and worm medicine.;   "Beyond the
inhumanity, I saw the love these guys have for each other," Bing says. "A lot
of homeboys are in wheelchairs (paralyzed in gang warfare). You should see the
love with which the other homeboys help them out of cars.";   In her book,
Bing presents an empathetic portrait of these gang members as "poor, young
American kids we've made unwelcome in their own country. They're doing what
society wants. They're staying in their own neighborhoods and killing each
other.";   Often she's appalled by what they do. More often she's appalled by
society's response.;   "We are apparently unable to directly confront an
entire generation . . . who are sub-literate and without marketable skills.
Who have virtually no options except the gangs. With an average life
expectancy of 19 years.";   Los Angeles police estimate there are 90,000 gang
members in that city. Tentacles of the major gangs have spread throughout the
country, bringing dope dealing, guns and fear.;   Some people think drugs are
at the root of the gang problem, but Bing doesn't believe it.;   Some people
think more jails are the solution, but Bing doesn't believe that, either.;  
The problem, she says, "is rage. They're angry. They see their mothers doing
without. Their enemy is the government.;   "The homeboys want things to
change. But you can't say change without giving these kids some options."  </TEXT>
