It was 7-year-old Kanita Haley's turn at bat. 
</P>
<P>
As the second-grader from Watts bent down to pick up a baseball bat, a car sped 
around a nearby corner, according to witnesses. A man pointed a gun out the 
passenger-side window, and the shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
Other children instinctively dove to the ground Wednesday night on the stretch 
of dirt and grass just inside the Imperial Courts housing project. But Kanita, 
just five days shy of her eighth birthday, panicked and ran. A bullet tore into 
her right temple. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center said Thursday that the 
girl was critically wounded and was being kept alive by life-support machines. 
Police believe she is yet another innocent victim of gang warfare and its 
savage toll of children and teen-agers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a 14-year-old boy was shot to death as he sat on a park picnic 
table in an unincorporated area of the city. And a 13-year-old in an unrelated 
incident was wounded as he stood on a street near Fremont High School. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning in Juvenile Court, a 13-year-old girl was convicted of the 
June 2 shooting death in South-Central Los Angeles of a 14-year-old girl. Two 
teen-age boys were convicted of the same charge in the slaying last February of 
an 11-year-old who had been walking from a store in the Pico-Union area with 
her aunt and sister. 
</P>
<P>
Last year 70 people 17 years of age or younger were the victims of homicide in 
Los Angeles alone. Police say most of the deaths appear to stem from animosity 
between warring gang factions. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, however, the intended targets go unscathed and the innocent 
die. And many of the innocent are young people like Kanita Haley, who happened 
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
In Kanita's case, the wrong place was a fenced yard within earshot of her own 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the gunman was traveling in a late-model 
beige-colored compact car with one other person, but no one had been arrested 
by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 8:30 p.m. near the corner of Mona Boulevard and 
115th Street, just as some Imperial Courts parents were getting ready to call 
their children in from the communal yard that separates the rows of two-story 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Coleman, 46, a longtime resident of the project, said that the impromptu 
baseball game had been going strong just outside her kitchen window for some 
time. She had just decided to turn off her porch light and end the game when at 
least six shots rang out. She hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman said the shooting continued the whole time she ran from her front 
door to her back door to admit her son, who was frantically trying to get 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old man said Thursday that the gunman appeared to have been shooting 
at him and a group of friends who had been standing outside the yard. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who did not want his name made public, said he turned and ran into the 
yard and dove to the ground. As bullets ricocheted off metal poles in the yard, 
he said, Kanita ran by. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into Line of Fire 
</P>
<P>
The man said he and another man tried to pull her to safety but the girl ran 
toward her own apartment. Her route took her into the middle of the yard and 
straight into the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kanita's mother, 26-year-old Myrtle Murray, spent most of the day 
keeping a grim vigil at the hospital. When she returned home, she spoke only 
briefly to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Kanita's 9-year-old sister, Sharrale, said that Murray brought her four 
children to California four years ago, but was planning to return to Indiana 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Kanita attended Grape Street Elementary School and brought home mostly A's and 
B's, her sister said. 
</P>
<P>
As Sharrale spoke to reporters, scores of other children and their parents 
stood nearby. Mothers shuddered and held toddlers close to them. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't even let them play in the yard. That's a shame," said one parent. 
"You can't even sit in a chair some nights when you're in your own house. The 
shooting gets so bad, you have to sit on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Fearful 
</P>
<P>
Most of the women said they will never let their children play outside at night 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Sutton, a longtime community activist, said later, however, that people 
cannot hide in their homes in fear. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great need for concern about the level of the violence that is 
permeating our cities," said Sutton, who works primarily with the Brotherhood 
Crusade, a support group for community-based agencies. "There appears to be a 
tolerance that stems from inertia, insensitivity or fear." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said the only solution is for people to take to the streets and reclaim 
their neighborhoods. Such an action is planned this month and next in a 
110-square-block area of South-Central. It is being sponsored by the 
Brotherhood Crusade, which has enlisted the support of churches, grass-roots 
community groups and scores of individuals.
