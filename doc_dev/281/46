Bobbie Owens lived the nightmare of California's worst measles epidemic in two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the Pomona mother was about to have her 11-month-old son 
vaccinated -- about the earliest recommended age for measles vaccination -- 
when he caught the highly contagious virus. 
</P>
<P>
"That still runs through my head, over and over: If he could have just hung on 
for a few days for that shot," Owens, a 37-year-old single mother, said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
For seven days she tried in vain to break his fever, bathing him in a small tub 
of cold water. Almost as soon as the measles began dotting his stomach, they 
turned black from the heat of his tiny body. 
</P>
<P>
Once hospitalized at Childrens Hospital of Orange County, Nathan Timothy -- 
named after Owens' brother who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- was 
heavily sedated, and clung to life for a month. 
</P>
<P>
"He never opened his eyes again after we got him there," said Owens, whose baby 
died at the hospital on July 10, 1989. "It got to a point where all I hoped for 
was for him to open his eyes just one more time, so we could look at each other 
one more time." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not easy for me to talk about even now," she added. "I'd just like to 
say how important these vaccinations are. I wouldn't want any mother to go 
through what I've been through. Nobody ever thinks they will lose their baby to 
the measles. My two oldest kids had them and (the measles) were gone in a few 
days." 
</P>
<P>
The Owens family's story underscores how devastating and arbitrary the measles 
epidemic has been for the handful of Southern Californians who have lost loved 
ones to a virus that for years seemed a little threat. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have been suffering from measles since 1987, in what state health 
officials say is the longest running outbreak in the country. Nationwide, 
public health officials say the epidemic is the worst since an immunization 
shot was developed in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Measles outbreaks have been reported in at least 23 states this year, and the 
number of reported cases is running 70% ahead of last year's record pace, 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1963, most American children caught the measles. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of measles victims recover without specific treatment beyond 
fever-reducing medicines and liquids. But in some cases, complications develop, 
including vomiting, dehydration, pneumonia and encephalitis, and sometimes 
patients die. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that are unexplained, there have been a higher percentage of 
serious complications and deaths in the current California epidemic than in 
previous epidemics in the state. California's measles outbreak has been 
compared by one national health official to that of a Third World nation. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County this year, measles has struck 141 people, killing two -- a 
7-month-old Santa Ana boy and an 10-month-old Anaheim girl. Both children were 
too young to be immunized, say health officials, who recommend vaccinations at 
12 months. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, health department officials say that measles have struck 
1,500 people this year, killing six. The dead are a 43-year-old, a 29-year-old, 
a 16-year-old, a 10-year-old cancer patient, and two children less than 3 years 
old. Statewide, the measles have afflicted 1,800 people, killing 24. 
</P>
<P>
Poor, inner-city children of preschool age -- primarily Latinos -- have been 
hit hardest by the epidemic. Lack of government funding has crippled efforts by 
public health officials to curb the outbreak, also known as red measles or 
rubeola. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys indicate that as many as 30% of California's children -- and 50% of 
minority children -- have not been vaccinated by age 2. Pediatricians generally 
advise inoculating babies at 12 to 15 months and again when they reach 
kindergarten age. 
</P>
<P>
So Bobbie Owens was ahead of schedule when she made a mid-June appointment last 
year for Nathan's measles shot. Separated from her children's father, she was 
living on state aid and having her medical bills paid by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just started learning to walk, saying a few words, like 'Mama,' and 
'Dada' and 'Digga Digga.' All those baby goo-goo noises," Owens said during an 
interview at her Pomona apartment. She did not know that measles vaccinations 
do not always take in children less than a year old. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Owens had already lost one son -- to Los Angeles gangs. When her 
eldest son, Terrell, was 13 and began saluting his junior high pals with gang 
signs, Owens feared that the peer pressure to join would be too great for a 
teen-age boy with no big brother or father at home. So she sent him to live 
with his grandparents in Louisiana. He would never see his only brother. 
</P>
<P>
These and other thoughts filled her head as she sat beside Nathan's hospital 
crib each day, 15 or 20 hours sometimes, talking and cooing to her baby. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept telling me there was nothing I could've done. But still, you 
wonder," Owens said. Her 10-year-old daughter, Lacreshia, a second mother to 
Nathan, has been devastated, too. She sometimes wanders out of the room when 
Nathan's name comes up. She will only occasionally mention missing her brother. 
</P>
<P>
Owens and her family have handled the ordeal by going to church frequently. 
There are plenty of pictures of Nathan around their apartment, among the other 
family photographs and an illustration of the Last Supper. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have got through this without praying," Owens said. "I have to 
think that for some reason this was meant to be."
