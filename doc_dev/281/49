   Joe Pantoliano of NBC's ``The Fanelli Boys''
says his career nearly ended before it started, when he almost
missed out on a role in his high school senior play because of his
third-grade reading level.
   The chance to act, and two dedicated teachers, gave him the
motivation to improve his reading skills.
   ``When I was cast in `Up The Down Staircase,' it was a major
victory,'' said Pantoliano, who launched a busy career in movies
with that high school play in New Jersey. ``I didn't read well. I
was really a bad student.
   ``When I auditioned for the play, I had a third-grade reading
equivalency. I'd memorized the text and made it look like I was
reading,'' he said.
   ``Acting was something I'd always wanted to do but had been
afraid of because of the ridicule I'd get from my family and
friends - which was soon forthcoming.''
   Pantoliano's new comedy series, ``The Fanelli Boys,'' is about a
boisterous Italian family of four grown brothers, whose misfortunes
send them back to live with their strong-willed mother and to run
the struggling family-owned funeral home.
   Pantoliano plays Dominic, a small-time hustler.
   ``With `The Fanelli Boys,' they sent me a script, I read it,
talked to them, and they offered me the job,'' he said. ``If it was
always that easy, I'd like this business.
   ``Dominic is an entrepreneur, a jack of all trades, a master of
none. His role models are Cary Grant and John Gotti. He's the kind
of man who would bend the law, but never break it. As we go along,
I'm less and less involved in the extracurricular activities.''
   Others in the cast are Ann Guilbert as the mother, and
Christopher Meloni, Ned Eisenberg and Andy Hirsch as the other
brothers. Richard Libertini plays the boys' uncle, a burned-out
Catholic priest suffering a mid-life crisis.
   The setting of the show, which is on Wednesdays opposite ABC's
``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' and CBS' ``Jake and the Fat Man,'' echoes
part of Pantoliano's upbringing.
   He grew up in Hoboken, N.J., where his father worked for 15
years for a funeral home.
   ``He drove a hearse, picked up bodies and acted as a
pallbearer,'' Pantoliano said.
   A family with problem characters is nothing new for Pantoliano,
who said his stepfather was a small-time gangster who served time
in prison.
   ``His father had been a wiseguy, and he aspired to be like
him,'' Pantoliano said at his home in the Venice area of Los
Angeles. ``He hijacked the Hoboken Ferry once. He was after three
liquor trucks on the ferry, but he couldn't get one of the trucks
started. So he took the ferry all the way to Poughkeepsie. That
made it interstate kidnapping.
   ``A year later, one of the gang members was busted. He didn't
finger my stepfather, but he (the stepfather) still got seven years
in prison. When he finally got out of prison, he was 50 and went
straight. He warned me never to become a gangster.''
   When Pantoliano left high school, he went across the Hudson
River and entered acting school in New York City. He landed his
first acting job at the age of 19.
   ``I got $10 a week, and it took $9 a week for food,'' he said.
``I lived over the theater in Compton, R.I. I got little bit parts
in movies in New York. I finally moved to Los Angeles because I
couldn't get arrested in New York.''
   In Los Angeles, he was cast in a series called ``McNamara's
Band.'' It folded after three episodes and he was out of work for
eight months. Next came ``Free Country,'' which ran six episodes.
   Then he landed the part of Angelo Maggio in the 1979 miniseries
``From Here To Eternity,'' the role that won an Oscar for Frank
Sinatra in 1953.
   NBC turned ``From Here to Eternity'' into a regular series and
offered to revive the role of Maggio - who died in the original -
but Pantoliano turned it down.
   ``They offered me a fortune, but I'd done the role,'' he said.
``I spent the next 12 months working as a waiter in an Italian
restaurant. Once I waited on Fred Silverman, the man at NBC I'd
said `no' to. I was broke, but even now I don't live
extravagantly.''
   Pantoliano's first role after that was in the theatrical movie
``The Idolmaker'' - and the first scene was filmed in the same
restaurant where he had waited tables.
   He has worked steadily since, appearing in such movies as
``Risky Business,'' ``Goonies,'' ``Running Scared,'' ``La Bamba,''
``Midnight Run,'' ``Empire of the Sun'' and ``The Mean Season.''
   He's also in the upcoming ``Zandalee,'' with Nicholas Cage and
Judge Reinhold, in which he plays a transvestite.
