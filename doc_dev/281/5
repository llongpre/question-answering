   The Church of Love promised Angels of Love
and a paradise called Chonda-Za, but federal prosecutors say it was
a sex-fantasy scam that bilked more than 31,000 lonely men out of at
least $4.5 million.
   Donald S. Lowry, 59, and Pamala St. Charles, 24, were scheduled
to go on trial on fraud charges Monday in federal court in Peoria,
with prosecutors saying they would attempt to prove the pair built a
money-making myth based on photographs of nude and semi-nude young
women.
   The operation was centered in the Quad Cities _ Moline, Ill., and
Rock Island, Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa _ where police called
the photos ``soft-porn provocative.''
   Federal authorities say the photos aren't the real problem.
``This isn't an obscenity trial, it's a fraud trial,'' said
assistant U.S. Attorney Tate Chambers.
   Indictments returned in December named Ms. St. Charles, Lowry and
his wife, Esther Lowry. All three were charged with multiple counts
of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy and unlawfully using fraud
proceeds. The charges against Mrs. Lowry were dropped recently, but
Chambers declined to say why.
   According to the indictment, Lowry and his wife formed the COL
Corp. in June 1974 while they were also operating a company called
Lydian Manor Publishers. In May 1986, Ms. St. Charles joined the
corporation and soon became Lowry's chief assistant.
   Meanwhile, COL allegedly began mailing out ``initial pitch
letters'' to men, asking them to send between $20 and $30 for a
membership fee, according to the indictment.
   The letters said the Church of Love was founded in June 1965 by a
teen-age Mexican girl named Maria Simona Mireles. Prosecutors say
Maria Mireles was played, when necessary, by Mrs. Lowry.
   ``Mother Maria,'' as she was called, supposedly lived with many
young women known as the ``Angels of Love'' on a farm near Hillsdale
just north of the Quad Cities, according to the letters.
   The letters claimed Mother Maria and the Church of Love wanted to
establish a valley paradise to be known as Chonda-Za, where men
could join the Angels, have all their wishes fulfilled and spend the
rest of their lives, the indictment states.
   To solicit funds, the COL made various misrepresentations,
including telling recruits that the Angels needed money for Mother
Maria's garden fund at the nonexistent retreat. The Angels depended
on the garden for food in winter, the letters explained.
   The case originally was scheduled for trial in the Quad Cities,
but was moved to Peoria because of extensive publicity. The jury
trial is expected to take five weeks.
