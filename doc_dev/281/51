   County supervisors considering joining the
city in banning semiautomatic assault rifles heard testimony Tuesday
about how the fatal shooting of a mother traumatized her husband and
children.
   Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has proposed a ban on the sale and
possession of the military-style rifles in unincorporated areas of
Los Angeles County. An anticipated vote was delayed, however,
because one supervisor was ill.
   Meanwhile, in Olympia, Wash., a Republican state senator who
strongly opposes gun controls bowed Tuesday to demands that the Law
and Justice Committee he heads consider restrictions on ownership of
semi-automatic weapons. Sen. Kent Pullen said he will hold a hearing
next Tuesday, but would wait for public response before deciding
whether to hold a committee vote.
   Several California cities have banned the guns and state
lawmakers have begun considering action since a man with an assault
rifle killed five children and wounded 29 others and a teacher at a
Stockton school Jan. 17.
   Although the vote was delayed two weeks, the county Board of
Supervisors listened to testimony about the victims of shootings.
   The Rev. Guy Wilson, pastor of Our Lady of Victory Church in
Compton, said that last year he lost 13 parishioners to gunfire in
the gang-ridden south central Los Angeles area. He brought with him
the children of one victim, Rosalinda Cisneros, 28, who was slain by
an assault weapon 18 months ago.
   ``The Cisneros family, the five children here with me, they saw
their mother gunned down,'' Wilson said.
   ``The mother had in her arms her 4-week-old child. When she heard
the shooting, she turned to protect the child, and she herself took
the shot through the heart and died,'' Wilson said.
   He said the father was so traumatized he turned to drink and is
now in prison for an alcohol-related offense. The five children now
live with another family who have eight children of their own,
Wilson said.
   Brian Baker, a member of the National Rifle Association, argued
against a ban. ``The issue is being touted as a law and order
concern, but I feel we're seeing a cynical attempt to accomplish ...
total gun confiscation,'' he said.
   Under the proposal, the assault rifles could still be owned by
museums, licensed dealers, law enforcement agencies and the military.
   The cities of Stockton, Los Angeles, Carson and Compton have
enacted bans on semiautomatic assault rifles, and one was proposed
Monday in San Diego.
   Colt Industries Inc. filed a federal lawsuit in Los Angeles on
Monday, saying the city's new law banning sales of semiautomatic
rifles will cause the firm financial harm and hurt its image. The
weapons company makes the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which is
included under the law.
