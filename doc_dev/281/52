'ANGEL TOWN' MISSES THE MARK

The awkward, tediously violent "Angel Town" (citywide) introduces former world 
kick-boxing champion Olivier Gruner as a new French graduate student at a 
fictional local university -- read USC -- whose martial arts skills come in 
handy when he takes on a Chicano gang terrorizing his landlady (Theresa 
Saldana), who lives in a large, run-down, turn-of-the-century house. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that some five years earlier Saldana's husband took a stand against 
gang violence in the neighborhood and paid for it with his life. 
</P>
<P>
Now the gang maintains a near nonstop harassment of Saldana's teen-age son 
(Frank Aragon) to try to force him to accept membership in the very outfit that 
murdered his father. It would seem that Gruner has arrived in the nick of time, 
yet before he's able to do his stuff effectively the gang manages to terrorize 
Saldana's mother-in-law into a fatal heart attack and rape Saldana besides. 
</P>
<P>
Writer S. Warren and director Eric Karson make no attempt to explore the gang 
phenomenon or psychology; the gang members are simply hateful figures of evil, 
the stereotypical ethnic bad guys whom the hero predictably defeats in the 
final reel. The wiry Gruner has presence, and when it comes to kick-boxers, is 
a better actor than the more monumental-looking Dolph Lundgren. 
</P>
<P>
The acting honors, however, go to Saldana, who suggests the cruel irony of the 
Chicano family who has worked hard to own its own home only to find the 
neighborhood disintegrating around it. "Angel Town" (rated R for violence) 
works up some exploitation-picture energy at the beginning, but it dissipates 
into protracted mayhem.
