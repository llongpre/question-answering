   A 3-year-old girl whose father committed
suicide rather than watch his family ravaged by AIDS has died of
the disease, a month after her mother.
   The death of Angela Folsom on Sunday left just one survivor in
the family of Jennifer Folsom, who made her battle with AIDS public
this summer to show the disease can strike the traditional family
in rural America.
   Mrs. Folsom's husband, Doug Folsom, committed suicide in June.
His wife said he was unable to bear watching the disease destroy
the family.
   Angela had never learned how to walk and moved in with her
grandparents after her mother died Sept. 3.
   ``She was just worn down,'' said Fred Kenney, her uncle. ``A lot
of it was the transition of losing her mother and moving to another
home.''
   ``I have mixed feelings,'' he said. ``Mostly I'm glad that she's
not in pain anymore, because she had been on morphine. Of course we
hate to see her go.''
   Mrs. Folsom believed she contracted the disease through a blood
transfusion during an emergency appendectomy in 1979. That was
before blood supplies were tested for the virus.
   She was diagnosed with the disease in 1988, and tests later
found that Angela also had AIDS. Another daughter, 5-year-old
Nicolette, has not tested positive for the virus and is the sole
surviving member of the family.
   Kenney said Angela was hospitalized for four days last month
after a feeding tube inserted into her stomach failed to heal
properly. In recent weeks, she had received 24-hour nursing care.
   ``Over the last three or four weeks she deteriorated just the
way Jennifer did,'' Kenney said.
   Kenney said Nicolette, who attended her mother's funeral, is
living with her grandparents but may move in with an aunt and
cousin.
   He said an art therapist visits Nicolette twice weekly. The girl
once drew a picture of the sky with a rope hanging down to the
house. She told her mother it was God sending a rope for Angela.
   But shortly after her father's suicide, Nicolette amended the
caption, saying, ``It was for Daddy.''
   ``She feels that she still has family,'' Kenney said. ``I'm just
hoping my parents can get through it and we'll go on from there.''
