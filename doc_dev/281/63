   ``Lost Angels'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R.)
   
   Southern California youth, Hollywood would have us believe, are
interested only in sex, drugs, alcohol, fast cars, good times and
having their own outtasight pads. They love to spend their parents'
money, except they're too stupid to really know how to count change
and bills, so they steal or hustle or use credit cards.
   These same spoiled, empty and ignorant teens pop up like
laminated paperdolls in Hugh Hudson's ``Lost Angels,'' a
superficial tale about some seriously disturbed young people and
their seriously disturbed parents.
   Unlike ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and other teen-oriented
movies in which irresponsibility and often crime are played for
laughs, ``Lost Angels'' takes a hard line and tells us that
trashing someone else's property, driving a car into a swimming
pool or physically abusing another youngster for being a good
student or a virgin just isn't very nice.
   Tim Doolan (Adam Horovitz) lives with his bloated mother and her
bloated second husband in an affluent housing development. Mother
snivels about how good stepdad is to take them in. Stepdad talks
about discipline but crudely urinates in a punch bowl during a
party.
   Tim hangs out with a gang called D.A.B. (Dead at Birth). They're
middle-class white kids who have nothing better to do with their
time such as read, develop a skill or hobby, get an after-school
job or do volunteer work, pursue cultural activities or sports. So
they adapt Hispanic names and rumble with the 10th Street Gang, a
group of Latin kids.
   When they're not fighting, hurling racial slurs or otherwise
trying to prove the superiority of the white race, they break into
the homes of vacationing families and destroy everything in sight.
Why? No reason, opines one D.A.B. member, it's just something to
do. These are kids whose parents have money, but do not have class,
values or culture.
   Tim is arrested and sent to juvenile hall after his girlfriend
gets high and parks her mother's new car in the family pool. He's
sent to Valley Acres, a center for troubled youth.
   This is where the filmmakers slip into ``David and Lisa'' land.
But the celebrated 1963 Frank Perry movie was an intelligent, case
history drama with a degree of authenticity. ``Lost Angels'' has
none of those qualities. Even Donald Sutherland as a tortured
alcoholic and committed doctor can not save this video, which is
not worth the rental.

   ``Pet Sematary'' (Paramount Home Video. Priced for Rental. Rated
R)
   
   Victims in horror movies have one thing in common: They lack
common sense and use bad judgment. In short, they're stupid.
   ``Pet Sematary,'' the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel,
offers a good look at the stupidity factor.
   Louis Creed moves his wife, Rachel, daughter, Ellie, and toddler
son, Gage, into a house on one of the fastest trucker speed strips
in Maine. The minute they arrive, the wife takes Gage out of his
car seat, sets him on the lawn and turns her back on him. Gage
wanders towards the highway to wave to a passing truck. A neighbor,
Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne), snatches the lad out of the jaws of
steel just in time.
   Do the Creeds put up a fence? Don't be silly.
   The stupidity factor escalates. During a family picnic, Creed
allows Gage to fly a kite and hands him the ball of twine. The baby
drops the twine and all watch as the kite runs away. Creed turns
his back on the baby, who dashes after the kite and into a truck.
   But that's not the end of Gage, and only the beginning of the
horror awaiting the Creeds.
   Because the movie's characters do so many misguided things,
their behavior and the film's action becomes more predictable and
less scary. Everything is neatly laid out in ``Pet Sematary,'' and
that's one of the problems; you don't feel the hairs twitching on
your neck. And what's the point of a horror movie if it doesn't
scare you?
   ``Pet Sematary,'' beautifully photographed by Peter Stein,
explores the human fear of death and dying, and the tempting notion
of bringing back the dead. But as Jud says, ``sometimes dead is
better.''
   Behind the crudely constructed cemetery for pets, which had been
made over several generations by children, is an ancient Indian
burial ground. Only problem, the soil has ``gone sour'' and the
place is evil.
   Creed finds out when Jud takes him there to bury Ellie's cat,
Church, who had also tap-danced with a truck. But Jud neglects to
tell Creed that what returns isn't always the same as what was
buried. Sweet and gentle Church returns as Pit Cat.
   So it is with a certain prescient horror that Creed takes his
dead son to the same burial ground. What comes back would make
Freddie and Jason proud.
   There's plenty of slicing and dicing in ``Pet Sematary,'' and
some clever special effects by Lance and David Anderson to show
spilled brains, severed heads, etc. There's also a campy turn near
the end as Creed finally kills the returned Gage. The baby, who has
just come off a killing spree, looks at him, pouts and says, ``no
fair.''
   Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby are just fine as Louis and
Rachel. But Gwynne upstages even Church the Pit Cat with his down
East flavor.
   King wrote the screenplay and tries to remain true to his book,
which was not necessarily a wise move because the story doesn't
move fast enough and, even at the slow pace, there are a lot of
holes.
   Still, it's an OK video for a rainy Halloween weekend.
