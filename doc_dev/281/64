   Twelve-year-old Sandy Rodriguez resisted to the end the death
that had stalked her since Christmas.
   When it took her in its clutches early Tuesday at her Elizabeth,
N.J., home, she enlisted her nurse to help her from her deathbed
and drive her to a hospital chapel.
   ``Dear God. This is Sandy,'' she pleaded aloud. ``Please help
me, God. Help me, please. I don't want to hurt anymore. I'm
scared.''
   Almost every part of her body, from her head to her
toothpick-thin legs, had been hurting from AIDS. The virus had
apparently slipped into her body through a transfusion needed when
she was born prematurely, her family says.
   Sandy, who succumbed later on Tuesday, was among the nearly
2,500 children under 13 who have contracted AIDS in the United
States since the epidemic began. More than half those children have
died.
   In the days before her death, those who loved Sandy were unable
to hold her because her 40-pound body and 4-foot-5 frame were so
brittle and so black and blue with bruises caused by the slightest
touch.
   At 3 a.m. Tuesday, she prayed in the chapel to realize a child's
dreams: to walk out of her bed without the pain in her belly and
legs, to go back to school and her friends, to have another party
like the big barbecue the aunt who raised her gave for her 12th
birthday on May 1, and to see New Kids on the Block.
   Her No. 1 wish was to fly to Puerto Rico to visit her
grandmother, Minga, and to see the clouds from the plane.
   She had fought to the very end to fulfill that wish, which
seemed to be within reach. Angel Pena, of Allendale, N.J., an
account executive for an electronics company, read of Sandy's
ill-fortune two weeks ago and visited her. He said he was helping
arrange the trip for her and her aunt. Instead, Sandy flies to
Puerto Rico in death for burial there.
   ``I don't want to die,'' her nurse, Holly Popovich, who took her
to the chapel, heard her pray from her wheelchair. ``I want to
live.''
   ``I think she knew all weekend,'' said Ms. Popovich. ``She
didn't want to sleep. She was afraid to fall asleep.''
   Sandy had told Ms. Popovich, ``You take me for a ride in your
car. I want to go to church. I want to talk to God. I want to
pray.''
   On her way out of the chapel, she blessed herself with holy
water and took some for her aunt, Carmen Candelaria, whom she
called her mother. Mrs. Candelaria took Sandy from her own sister
when she was born because the sister was unable to care for her.
   Sandy's mother died two years ago after mixing Valium and
alcohol at a party, Mrs. Candelaria said. She said she knows
nothing about Sandy's father. Her own husband, the man Sandy called
her father, was killed when she was 7 in a holdup in Puerto Rico,
where the family lived for five years.
   Fearing death, Sandy stalled it.
   After leaving the chapel, she insisted on going to an all-night
supermarket, where she bought candy, gum and a Mickey Mouse book.
   Upon returning home shortly after 5 a.m., she blessed her aunt
with the holy water. ``Mommy, I love you,'' she said.
   They kissed. Tears came to Mrs. Candelaria.
   ``Don't cry, Mommy,'' Sandy implored her.
   ``I just want you to lie down and sleep,'' Mrs. Candelaria told
her.
   ``No, Mom. I just want to do some coloring. Put the bed up. Give
me some crayons and a book.''
   Mrs. Candelaria put the crayons and book on the bed next to
Sandy. The girl loved to color and had painted many pictures for
her day nurse, Doreen Small, to make amends for taking out her
anger on her.
   She was too weak to use the crayons. She called out the names of
friends absent, her final roll call of goodbyes: ``Glissette,'' her
sister, ``Lues,'' her cousin, ``Doreen,'' her nurse, ``Wanda,'' her
friend.
   Shortly after 9 a.m., dressed in a New Kids on the Block
T-shirt, she slipped away to a place where, she had told a recent
visitor, everything is beautiful.
   ``You go to God, go to Jesus in a big place where he lives,''
she had said. ``My father is in there. Everyone who dies goes
there. ... I can walk in there. No pain in my stomach, no pain in
my knee and I walk again.''
