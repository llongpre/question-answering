   For the first time in 21 years, former
Black Panther Johnny Spain is out of jail, but the man convicted of
slaying two prison guards in the bloody 1971 ``San Quentin Six''
escape attempt is not yet a free man.
   Release of the one-time prison revolutionary has been opposed
consistently by the state. But his parole has been urged by
enthusiastic supporters, including Dennis Riordan, his attorney for
the past 12 years, two congressmen and two prison guards, one the
best friend of one of the slain San Quentin officers.
   While in prison, Spain, 38, earned a high school diploma, became
an electrician and has been a model prisoner in recent years. He
has had no disciplinary action against him since 1979, when he was
caught with marijuana.
   He left the California Medical Facility in Vacaville last week
after a series of court actions allowed friends and relatives to
post $350,000 bail for his freedom.
   ``I won't let anyone down who has supported me, and there have
been many who supported me,'' he promised upon his release, adding
that he expected life outside prison to be difficult. ``I'll deal
with it. I'm prepared. I've thought about it a lot.''
   However, Spain still faces a new trial on the prison murders and
a Monday hearing at which the state will argue against the order
calling for that trial. A 2-1 state Board of Prison Terms decision
to parole Spain next year also will be reviewed by the entire
nine-member board March 11.
   Spain had been behind bars continuously since his arrest at the
age of 17 in December 1966 for the first-degree murder and robbery
of a Los Angeles man.
   While on bail, authorities said Spain will live in San Francisco
and work as an electrician. He also will be allowed to travel
around the state and visit his wife and childhood sweetheart,
Pinkey, whom he married in 1977 while in prison. They have two sons.
   It was a twisting courtroom trail that finally opened Spain's
cell door.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson overturned the San Quentin
murder conviction in 1986, saying Spain had been deprived of his
right to a fair trial by being shackled in 25 pounds of chains in
every court appearance in the case.
   But Spain still had to remain behind bars because of the 1966
murder conviction.
   But Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Parker
ordered Spain paroled immediately for the 1966 murder-robbery.
Parker said he was eligible for release because the state Board of
Prison Terms improperly extended his sentence six years by applying
regulations passed in 1976 to disciplinary violations committed in
1970 and 1971.
   That action cleared the way for bail to be set in the San
Quentin retrial.
   During a trial that took almost five years, Spain was convicted
of murdering two San Quentin guards in a bloodbath that left one
other guard, prison militant George Jackson and two prisoners dead.
   Prison authorities said Spain was seen bolting from the
maximum-security unit with Jackson and helped plot the unsuccessful
escape attempt.
   Although no one said Spain actually killed guards Jere Graham
and Frank DeLeon, he was found culpable under state law because he
had conspired to escape with Jackson.
   Bullets hidden in hollow bars of soap and a map reportedly
showing escape routes were found afterward in his cell in a section
reserved for death row and problem inmates.
   Spain and Jackson, a Black Panther leader and author of the
book, ``Soledad Brothers,'' had become friends while incarcerated
together at Soledad State Prison before both were transfered to San
Quentin.
   Spain had a troubled childhood in Jackson, Miss. His mother was
a white woman married to a white man, but as Spain grew up, it
became increasingly clear that his biological father was a black
man, not his mother's husband. Segregated black schools refused to
accept him, as did white schools.
   His mother sent him at the age of 6 to live with a black couple
in East Los Angeles. He became a high school athlete, but also
joined a street gang and committed minor crimes that netted him a
stint in a juvenile facility before the 1966 robbery-murder.
