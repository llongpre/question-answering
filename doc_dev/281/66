   At 2 in the morning one day three
years ago, Barbara McFalls marched up to the door of a crack house
and demanded her daughter.
   If McFalls thought she'd left gangs and drugs behind when she
moved from East Los Angeles 14 years before, the horrible truth
came home that night. The daughter, now a successful career woman,
never returned to that scene, but the mother did _ picketing crack
houses, lecturing gang members and trying to save the children of
people who didn't care enough to do it themselves.
   ``We've got the LA connection, and it's bad,'' said McFalls, who
lives in the Meadowview neighborhood on Sacramento's south side.
   ``For Sale'' signs line her street, but McFalls has no intention
of running. Instead, she breaks up fights, corrals gang members to
help register voters and urges witnesses to gang violence to
testify. She persuaded two gang members wanted for crimes to
surrender, driving one to juvenile hall herself, and baked sweet
potato pies at the request of another who was being shipped to the
California Youth Authority.
   ``I get out there face to face with them. That's the only way
you can deal with them. And they respect you for it, too,'' said
McFalls, who walks amid the Bloods' red and the Crips' blue with
her own colors, the red and yellow of the Meadowview Improvement
Committee.
   ``You just can't be scared. You have to leave your fear tucked
away somewhere. If you let them know you don't like what's going on
in your neighborhood, they'll move.''
   Some 550 miles north on Interstate 5, Irine Tate never stops
letting them know how she feels. One day last winter, she painted
``NO DRUG PARKING'' in white block letters down the middle of her
Portland, Ore., street, on all four corners, along her retaining
wall and on her neighbor's garage door.
   ``They said, `We live around here, we pay rent.' I said, `You
don't pay no damn rent around here! So get the hell off my block!'''
   The gang members didn't like the dead-honest, drug-hating Tate,
but they had to respect her. She'd sit on her porch and watch their
comings and goings, listen to their deals and learn all she could.
Then she'd call the police, something her neighbors were afraid to
do.
   Tate and McFalls realize the risks they take in opposing the
lucrative drug trade. McFalls has a ``panic box'' in her home: push
the button and police surround her block within two minutes.
   Tate owns a bullet-proof vest. One day a gang member told her it
wouldn't do any good. ``We've got armor-piercing bullets,'' he
said. ``If we want you bad enough, we'll get you.''
   So far, the gangs haven't wanted to hurt either woman, both of
whom temper fear with faith. ``If God wants you to die, then you
die,'' Tate said. ``If God wants me to die with them shooting me,
then I'm going to die with them shooting me.''
   One Crip tried to buy her silence for $10,000, but she wasn't
selling.
   ``I could have paid my bills off and been sitting pretty if I'd
taken that money,'' she said over the drone of a TV soap opera.
``And whose life would I have ruined?
   ``I'd lose my own self-respect. I'd lose my dignity, my pride in
myself. And what would the kids think of me?''
   The kids see all, hear all. They know who's cooking, who's
selling and how much they're asking. Kids as young as 6 have become
lookouts and shills who steer crack customers to one gang's house
and away from a rival's.
   The answer, say McFalls and Ed Elmore, another member of the
Meadowview Improvement Committee, is to give kids guidance and
alternatives. Give them jobs in the summer and places to go besides
the streets. Put back into the community the money and hope that
crack dealers take out.
   A year ago, McFalls' street was crowded with gang members
dealing crack as openly as if they were selling T-shirts or
hamburgers. Now they've retreated indoors, paying rent to single
mothers and old people willing to turn their homes into crack
houses.
   Four California gang members moved in with one of Tate's
neighbors, and the young mother now smokes crack and wonders how to
get rid of her roommates. McFalls gets phone calls in the wee hours
from a woman who became an addict, gave birth to a one-pound baby
and now hears disembodied voices as she aimlessly rides buses
around the West.
   ``Don't you realize what you're doing to your own people?'' an
infuriated Tate once asked a gang member. ``You're ruining their
minds so they don't know how to think. You're killing them.''
   The Crip sat thinking for a long time. ``I guess you're right,''
he told her later. ``But I may as well be making the money as
somebody else.''
