   A man died Tuesday of wounds suffered in a
gang-related barrage of gunfire that killed his 6-year-old daughter
in their home.
   Meanwhile, a 16-year-old girl was slain on a street corner in an
apparent gang drive-by shooting Tuesday, authorities said.
   Salvador Saucedo, 39, died at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew
Medical Center two days after his daughter Irma was slain at their
home in what her 13-year-old brother said was a grudge over a
baseball cap of the wrong color.
   The Sheriff's Department continued its search for two men who
sprayed the home with bullets from a car Sunday night in Compton.
   Saucedo's wife, Maria Hernandez, 39, was in critical condition.
The girl's brother and cousin were slightly injured.
   ``It started with this hat,'' said Martin Saucedo, who suffered
a minor stomach wound. He said gang members had tried to take his
Kansas City Royals hat, which is blue, the color worn by the gang
the Crips.
   ``The guys that jumped me said it was a gang hat and I should
give it to them. I said no, I bought it with my own money at the
Paramount swap meet and it was mine,'' the teen-ager said.
   Martin's parents called deputies who broke up the fight, but the
gang members apparently returned, authorities said.
   On Tuesday, an unidentified 16-year-old girl was killed by shots
from a passing car in Paramount, southeast of Los Angeles, said
sheriff's Deputy Leo Weitzel. He said the slaying apparently was
gang-related.
   Gang violence has claimed at least 93 lives in 1988, according
to Los Angeles County law enforcement authorities.
