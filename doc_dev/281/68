   In the 30 years since fire at Our Lady of the
Angels School took the lives of 92 children and three teachers, the
neighborhood is changed, the school rebuilt. Stronger safety
measures are in effect at schools nationwide.
   But scars remain and sadness returns in the memories of those who
survived the elementary school disaster.
   ``I suppose it's a memory that will never go away,'' said Jean
Kobus, mother of two children who escaped the blaze.
   It was mid-afternoon on Dec. 1, 1958, when the fire broke out.
Authorities think it started in a pile of trash in a stairwell.
   Smoke and flames traveled quickly up the open stairwell,
spreading out on the top floor and trapping many of the school's
1,300 students and teachers in their rooms.
   ``The fire alarm went off ... and children were hanging out the
windows yelling `fire.' It was just mass pandemonium,'' recalled the
Rev. John Kobus, Mrs. Kobus' son, who was a 7-year-old second-grader
at the time.
   Efforts by firefighters, teachers and some neighbors couldn't
lessen the death toll that stands as the third worst in the city's
history.
   In the aftermath, sprinkler systems were installed in schools
with wood-based construction, Edward Prendergast, chief fire
prevention engineer with the Chicago Fire Department, said Wednesday.
   School systems nationwide also began requiring enclosed
stairwells, alarm systems, more fire-resistant material and more
fire drills.
   Kobus, now director of pastoral care at Chicago's St. Mary of
Nazareth Hospital, remembers escaping from his first-floor classroom
and being wet and cold outside.
   But his mother recalls the anxious moments of uncertainty as she
and her family searched for her children.
   ``We ... started running toward the school,'' she said in an
interview Wednesday from her suburban Glen Ellyn home. ``If we'd
meet anybody, we'd ask if they knew Milt (then a seventh-grader) or
John, and they'd say `no.'''
   Just outside the school, ``You could see the crowd was anxious
and frightened,'' she said.
   ``My father (finally) found John, who was kind of wandering
around,'' she said.
   Milton, now an executive with a technology school, had been
huddled with others in a second-floor classroom until a firefighter
knocked in the door, and made the children form a ``human chain'' to
walk to safety, Mrs. Kobus said.
   Milt's grandmother found him, his face black with soot, and took
him home.
   The effect on the Italian neighborhood was devastating. Mrs.
Kobus remembers visiting homes and talking to grieving mothers. She
estimates she went to at least 25 funerals.
   ``I felt guilty talking to them because I felt that my children
were safe, and I thank God for that, and they had to lose theirs,''
she said.
   ``All those closed coffins, pictures on the coffins. It was the
saddest thing in the world to see.''
   Sister Mary Fogarty was principal of then-nearby St. Mary's High
School, and was sent to the county morgue to identify the three
teachers killed. Children's bodies, and anxious relatives, also were
arriving, she said.
   She remembers a stunned silence among many family members she
consoled.
   ``They were so shocked and so crushed,'' she said. ``I don't
think they could work up hysteria.''
   ``We have never gotten over it,'' she said of herself and others
in the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary order of nuns,
which still runs the new Our Lady elementary school with 520
students.
   The Italian neighborhood has changed, and is now mostly black and
Hispanic, said the Rev. Michael Gabriel, pastor of the nearby Our
Lady of the Angels Church.
   He said a service to commemorate the victims will be in his
church Sunday.
   Despite the years that have gone by, he said, ``Our faith is the
only consolation in a tragedy like this.''
