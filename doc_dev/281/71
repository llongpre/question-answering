L.A. DISTRICT SUED FOR NOT ALLOWING TRANSFER;

A Watts mother of 10 has filed a federal civil rights complaint against the Los 
Angeles Unified School District for refusing to allow her son to attend a 
junior high school outside the gang-plagued neighborhood where they live. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed with the Department of Justice, alleges that the district 
violated Linda Lofton's right to "educate her child in a safe environment 
conducive to learning" when it would not bus her son away from his neighborhood 
to Nobel Junior High School in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton said she has kept her 12-year-old son, Ramon Atchison, at home since the 
beginning of the school year rather than send him to the local Charles Drew 
Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are bad, real bad," she said. "In our neighborhood there is always 
shooting. It's not safe. I just recently sent him to the store and some kids 
jumped Ramon, hit him on the head for fun and told him to 'watch your back.' I 
would love to send him to the neighborhood school, but I can't, not if I care 
about his life." 
</P>
<P>
School officials said Friday that Lofton must enroll her child in Drew before 
they can consider permitting him to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have is a non-enrollee," said Charles Palmer, the district's 
administrator for the area where Lofton lives. "She simply wants to transfer 
her child without first enrolling him. State law requires that the kid has to 
be enrolled. The school in her neighborhood has never had the child there on 
campus to be able to do anything for him." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Lofton enrolls her son at Drew, he would not attend school there 
because of overcrowding, Palmer said, but would be bused to Mt. Gleason Junior 
High School in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is not what she wants," Palmer said. "She wants to pick her own 
school." 
</P>
<P>
The children of Lofton, 35, range in age from 2 to 14. Of the seven who are of 
school age, three attend Lomita Magnet School in the Harbor area and two attend 
a local elementary school. Lofton said she would prefer that Ramon, who 
graduated last year from Lomita, go to Nobel, where her eldest son, Robert 
Atchison, 14, is a student. 
</P>
<P>
Ezola Foster, chairwoman of Black Americans for Family Values, a Watts-based 
group that filed the complaint Thursday on behalf of Lofton, said the worried 
mother is like many other South-Central Los Angeles parents who have turned to 
busing as a way to save their children from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible, and when you ask the school district for help they ignore you," 
she said. "She (Lofton) has been trying since the first day of school to enroll 
her child in a safe school, but she has been insulted and ridiculed and sent 
from one office to the next in violation of her rights." 
</P>
<P>
Foster's group filed similar complaints in February on behalf of parents at 
Jordan High School in Watts, who eventually were granted transfers for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Brown, principal at Drew, said her school is no different from any other 
school in the district. "We have occasional gang problems," she said. "(But) 
most of the kids are good kids, 98% are normal kids with average everyday 
problems. Our school is safe. If it weren't safe, we wouldn't be here."
