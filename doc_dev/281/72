Many people heard the barrage of gunfire that killed Andrea Denise Garrett in a 
housing project on the Eastside recently, but at first, few thought much of the 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always hearing stuff like that around here," said Michael, a 
self-described gang "associate," who was talking with friends several blocks 
away when the shooting occurred early on Feb. 12. "All I knew was, the bullets 
weren't coming at me." 
</P>
<P>
But even in the Aliso Village and Pico-Aliso city housing projects, considered 
by authorities to be among the most troubled public complexes in Los Angeles, 
the gunning down of an innocent person -- the 20-year-old Garrett, who was 
pregnant with her third child -- has shocked many who live in the aging, 
sprawling 2,400-resident mini-city that straddles East 1st Street in Boyle 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is -- oh, my God, she was pregnant," lifelong Pico-Aliso resident 
Breavon McDuffie said, echoing the sentiments heard throughout the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the death 10 years earlier of Communist organizer Damien Garcia, who 
was stabbed for allegedly sassing local gang members, have area residents been 
as upset as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant leaders, such as Anita Moore, have scoured the housing projects, talking 
to neighbors and strangers alike and urging cool heads. 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is another shooting for folks in Malibu to say, 'Well, those folks 
are at it again,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of fencing off the housing projects to outsiders, considered a major 
source of the trouble there, has surfaced as tenant leaders discuss possible 
solutions with city housing officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evictions Continue 
</P>
<P>
Also, evictions are continuing for residents who are involved in cocaine and 
other drugs. Authorities said drugs are usually to blame for most acts of 
violence, including Garrett's death, in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The area is commonly known to many as "Pico-Aliso," but there are two distinct 
housing projects. Aliso Village is north of 1st Street and the Pico-Aliso 
project stretches for a mile south from 1st Street to within the shadow of the 
Whittier Boulevard bridge. Community meetings to decry the violence have been 
organized but with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one gathering scheduled Friday by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) 
was canceled when authorities said the atmosphere in the aftermath of the 
shooting was too tense. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual show of force, even for the two 50-year-old housing projects, a 
special task force of more than 50 Los Angeles police officers and other law 
enforcement personnel in recent days has converged on Aliso Village to 
discourage any retaliation for Garrett's death. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just buying a few days of peace," said Lt. Sergio Robleto, who is 
heading the Hollenbeck Division investigation into the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Even the members of a local gang that police suspect was involved in the 
Garrett shooting are keeping a low profile, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they're going to get hit (in retaliation)," one veteran officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett was friendly with -- but not a member of -- the East Coast Crips First 
Street gang, a predominantly black gang that police officers say controls the 
cocaine trade in the projects. The area in the past was the territory of Latino 
gangs and police believe the shooting resulted from the growing tension between 
the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the middle of the showdown are the residents who, for the most part, 
seem to enjoy life in Pico-Aliso. Dolores Leyva -- a 22-year-old single mother 
of two whose $150-a-month two-bedroom apartment is next to a freeway on-ramp -- 
a lifelong resident, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up here," she said. "I know my neighbors and I have friends here. All 
that other stuff with drugs doesn't bother me. I'm not into drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Other Latinos, who make up an estimated 90% of the projects' residents, are 
more tentative, perhaps because they do not speak English or do not have legal 
residency in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Approached by a visitor, a group of chatty women hanging out their wash on 
clotheslines late one recent afternoon said they wanted peace and that they 
opposed the gangs. But in the next breath, several of them said they were 
powerless to prevent their sons' involvement in the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, senor, I try to do the best I can with my (four) sons," said Avelina 
Martinez. "But I can't be at all places at the same time to see if they're 
getting into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believes She's Stuck 
</P>
<P>
Ofelia Gomez added, "I just want to get out. But I can't afford to. I'm stuck, 
no?" 
</P>
<P>
Anita Moore, another Aliso Village resident, is more hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel safe here," the mother of five boys said, "I really do. Period." 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke -- several days after the shooting -- police officers raided 
several nearby vehicles, looking for a cache of semiautomatic rifles and other 
weapons. The noise of screeching tires and loud voices occasionally drifted 
into Moore's Spartan-looking living room, forcing a listener to lean forward to 
hear her words. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded of the police action outside, Moore, who has lived in the project for 
17 years, proudly said one son, Keith, has a steady job and her youngest, 
Marty, aspires to become a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"I know all the gang members around here and they give me respect," she said. 
"I could go out in the middle of a gang fight and they'd stop. I'm not a God or 
some kind of queen (because) maybe they may go fight somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay because I want to make them gang free. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the interview, however, Moore's upbeat mood turned to anger. One 
of her other sons had been arrested for stealing a car. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of Garrett has reinforced the need for more security and better 
accommodations at the Eastside projects, according to tenants' representatives, 
who are among the most vocal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Forces 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, city Housing Authority police and Hollenbeck Division 
officers provide the only security for the two housing projects. There are no 
physical barriers to keep out strangers who wander into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Most units, built during the flurry of post-Depression construction in Los 
Angeles, need painting, new floors and other repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives like McDuffie and Lucia Mendoza are constantly talking to 
neighbors, carrying their ideas to city housing officials, who promise to do 
their best to help them out. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Pico-Aliso units are currently being painted and anti-graffiti 
projects are an ongoing campaign. Some graffiti eulogizing the Garrett woman 
was among the first to come off the walls after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"That graffiti with her name is just plain vandalism," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
McDuffie has talked about erecting a fence around the housing projects to keep 
strangers out. The wide-open areas of grass between the apartments, the parking 
lots and the adjacent streets make it easy for outsiders to come in. 
</P>
<P>
But the fencing may give some residents, already down on themselves for living 
in public housing, further embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want people to feel fenced in," McDuffie said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza, the mother of three, is involved in organizing protests and community 
events to avert violence. She was among many residents who campaigned for more 
police foot patrols in the area and for citizen watch groups in her part of 
Aliso-Pico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peaceful Dance 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, on the night of the Garrett shooting, the 60ish-looking Mendoza 
helped organize a dance -- less than a mile from the crime scene -- where the 
evening passed peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone enjoyed themselves," she recalled. "There were even some gang members 
there and they, too, had a good time. I saw the police cars as I was leaving 
the dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know someone had been killed until the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
The best hope for the projects' residents, most agree, is the fight against 
drugs. But it's a struggle that few realistically expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Authority officials have evicted numerous residents of the projects for 
a variety of offenses in recent months, ranging from non-payment of rent to 
involvement in drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to stay on top of it but we need more help from the residents who can 
point out these people to us," said one Aliso Village housing official, who 
asked not to be identified. "In many cases, people who claim to be against 
drugs are harboring these dope dealers from the police." 
</P>
<P>
Frequent patrolling by Los Angeles police and Housing Authority officers scares 
away dope dealers for a while, but they return when the heat is off and police 
manpower is diverted elsewhere, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
The most disheartening side effect of the battle against the gang-controlled 
drug trade is is in how the projects' young are affected. 
</P>
<P>
"I was outside the other day," recalled Mendoza, "and this little chavalito, 
only 6 years old, says, 'I'm from TMC (a local gang that is allied with East 
Coast Crips). 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine . . . a 6-year-old boy saying that?"
