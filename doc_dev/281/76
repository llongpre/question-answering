Gloria Williams, the South Los Angeles mother who last month became the first 
parent to be arrested under a new state law that holds adults partially 
responsible for the gang-related crimes of their offspring, said that she tried 
discipline and even took a parenting class but was unable to steer her teen-age 
son away from gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I did all I could to help my son," Williams said in her first extensive 
interview since her arrest in late April. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has been accused by the Los Angeles city attorney's office of failing 
to "exercise reasonable care, supervision and control" of her 15-year-old son, 
who authorities said was a member of the Crips gang. The arrest was based in 
part on snapshots found in Williams' home, pictures that allegedly depict 
Williams posing with her son's fellow gang members and her other children 
brandishing weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview conducted over the weekend, Williams called the prosecutors' 
allegations "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"How could the police know about all the things I have done to try to help my 
son?" asked the petite, soft-spoken woman who works as an assembly line 
supervisor at an electronics plant. "All they see is a bunch of pictures of a 
party and some writing on the wall. They don't see everything my family has 
gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the photographs from family albums that police claim show her 
posing with teen-agers wearing gang colors do not prove that she condoned gang 
activity. Williams repeated earlier statements that the weapons pictured in 
other snapshots were not semiautomatics, but BB guns -- a contention under 
investigation by police. 
</P>
<P>
She said police spoke to her only on the telephone, and never made clear to her 
that she was suspected of committing any crime. The questions, she said, were 
all about the activities of her son, who is in custody, accused of 
participating in the gang rape of a 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Williams said, she never thought to volunteer to police that she 
had enrolled in a "skilled parenting" course that met each week at the 
Community Youth Sports and Art Foundation in the Crenshaw District. She 
received a certificate after completing 30 hours of course work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Participation Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
School officials confirmed her participation in the course. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested at her home April 29, Williams was charged formally two weeks ago with 
violating the parental responsibility law, which was passed by the state 
Legislature last year to combat gang-related crimes. If convicted, she could 
face a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
After her son's arrest, police searched the Williams home and allegedly found, 
in addition to the photographs, one of her children's bedroom walls covered 
with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after William's arrest, Deputy City Atty. Bruce Coplen 
said the evidence "proves without any reasonable doubt that Williams failed as 
a parent" because it showed that she knew about her son's gang affiliation, 
condoned it and may have even participated in his gang. 
</P>
<P>
Williams refused in the interview to discuss details of the charges against her 
son for fear of incriminating her son. 
</P>
<P>
But, wiping tears from her eyes, she insisted: "He is a good boy and we just 
want him home." 
</P>
<P>
Williams and her 20-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son live next door to her 
mother in a working-class neighborhood just west of Crenshaw Boulevard. Her 
15-year-old son, whose name has not been released because of his age, is being 
held at the Eastlake juvenile detention facility awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Dorsey High School, Williams said she moved into the small stucco 
house five years ago after separating from her husband of 17 years. Since then, 
Williams said, she has taken sole responsibility for raising the children. 
</P>
<P>
She said that her teen-age son took the parental separation hard -- and his 
troubles with the law began soon afterward. Police records indicate that over 
the last two years he has been arrested for crimes ranging from burglary to 
grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he was arrested, Williams said, she would "put him on punishment" by 
denying him telephone privileges and his house keys so that he could not leave 
their three-bedroom home without her consent. 
</P>
<P>
"I would ask him, 'What do you want to be? What do you want to do with your 
life?' " she said. "I took away his telephone and did not let him have any 
friends over." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she tried everything from scolding to spanking. "But when kids 
make up their minds to do something, nothing can stop them," she said. With a 
nervous pause, she added: "I hated to spank him because I was afraid that if I 
left a mark on him, I'd be in trouble for child abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that her son needed stricter guidance, she enrolled him last fall 
in a grass-roots alternative education program that provides classes for 
students expelled from high school because of criminal or bad conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors identified it as the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, 
the same facility where she took the parenting course. 
</P>
<P>
Chilton Alphonse, executive director of the foundation, described Williams as a 
naive mother who "did not know how to take control of her son so that he would 
stay out of the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she volunteered to take the weekly skilled parenting course and 
found it "helpful." She said when she heard "other parents talk about their 
kids running away or being sent to jail for drugs . . . I was shocked. I 
thought, 'Gee, my problems aren't that bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
But in April, three months after joining the class and just as she was 
preparing for a second marriage, Williams was stunned by successive shocks. 
First came her son's April 27 gang-rape arrest. Police alleged that the 
12-year-old victim was kidnaped from Williams' back yard and was raped by at 
least a dozen gang members over a three-day period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Whole Bunch of Police Cars' 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, she was arrested. "It was about 4 (p.m.) and I was making out 
some checks to pay bills, and getting ready to go pick up my wedding dress," 
Williams recalled. "My daughter yelled that a whole bunch of police cars were 
parked down the street. 
</P>
<P>
"When they came up to my house, I just thought they wanted to search the place 
again," she said. "They put the handcuffs on me and I looked at my (8-year-old) 
son. He just stared at me and I told my mother to take care of my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Williams was charged under a provision of the 1988 Street Terrorism Enforcement 
and Prevention Act. She spent four hours in jail at the Southwest Police 
Station and was released on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Debra Gonzales said police had interviewed Williams about 
her "failure to control" her son before her arrest, adding: "I know she was 
asked whether she knew her son was in a gang and if she realized the 
significance of the graffiti on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gonzales said she was uncertain whether police explained to Williams 
that they were looking for proof that she had tried to control her son. As a 
result, Gonzales acknowledged, the mother may have been hesitant to answer 
officers' questions, fearing that the information might be used against her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly how she was questioned, I wasn't there," Gonzales said. 
If, in fact, "she has made efforts to curb his gang activity, that information 
would certainly be relevant to this case," Gonzales added. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, said it 
appears that authorities failed to thoroughly investigate the facts before 
Williams was charged with parental neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the parental responsibility law "vague and ridiculous," Ripston said 
police and prosecutors "are desperate to try to make this law work, so they 
went out looking for someone to prosecute. They want to show that they are 
trying to do something about (the gang) problem, so they rushed to prosecute 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who is to be tried on June 22, said she has considered "quitting my 
job to keep closer watch on my kids, but we could have never made it on 
welfare. . . . If they put me in jail, then what's going to happen to my kids? 
Is that going to solve the problem?"
