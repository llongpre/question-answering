Joey Paul Bellinger -- the fugitive 16-year-old Long Beach youth charged last 
month with killing one deaf man and attempting to kill a second in a roadside 
confrontation in Granada Hills -- was arrested in central New York, authorities 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger -- who was described by police as an associate of a West Los 
Angeles-based skinhead gang -- was arraigned and held without bail Saturday at 
the Oneida County Correctional Facility in Oriskany, N.Y., said Sgt. Phil 
Brockway of the Oneida County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department Detective Mitch Robins, who worked on the case 
with New York investigators, was en route to New York on Saturday to 
participate in extradition proceedings against Bellinger, which are scheduled 
for early this week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was taken into custody without incident at an acquaintance's house 
around 11:50 p.m. Friday in Cassville, a village in the town of Paris, Brockway 
said. He was arrested by FBI agents working out of the Utica office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen had been sought as the alleged gunman in the Jan. 28 shooting of two 
brothers, Cesar and Edward Vieira, both of Palmdale. Cesar Vieira, 30, died the 
following day of chest wounds. Edward Vieira, 25, is still recovering from 
wounds to his hip and shoulder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was riding in a car with four friends when they pulled up next to the 
Vieira brothers, who were on a motorcycle at the intersection of Devonshire 
Street and Balboa Boulevard, police said. After a "stare-down contest" between 
the occupants of the car and the two brothers, the vehicles pulled into a 
nearby parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers -- who had limited speaking skills and usually communicated 
through sign language -- were apparently unable to understand what was 
happening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vieira brothers' mother, Bernice Cree, said Saturday from her home in 
Reseda that she was relieved with Bellinger's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God he's been caught," Cree said. "I hope he is punished as a man, and 
not as a juvenile. Now I can go to bed and sleep, because I haven't had a good 
night's sleep since this happened." 
</P>
<P>
Police charged Bellinger with the shooting after two teen-agers who were riding 
in the car talked to authorities. Those teens were not charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
At first, investigators thought that Bellinger had been staying with friends in 
the Hollywood-Fairfax area. He had left his Long Beach home about seven months 
earlier, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal warrant for his arrest was issued Feb. 12 after FBI authorities 
determined that Bellinger had friends and relatives living in Utica, and had 
apparently traveled there, an FBI spokesman said. The warrant charged Bellinger 
with unlawful interstate flight to escape prosecution, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Brockway said a tip provided to the FBI led to Bellinger's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was living with Susan Alguire, who said in an interview with the 
Utica Observer-Dispatch that she provided the youth with room and board at the 
request of his mother, a high school friend. "She didn't say, 'I want you to 
hide my son,' " Alguire said. "I'm in shock." 
</P>
<P>
Alguire said that Bellinger's mother, Phyllis Bellinger, said that she and her 
husband were planning to move back to New York to live. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Bellinger could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was brought before U.S. District Magistrate Gustave J. DiBianco on 
Saturday. At the hearing, an assistant U.S. attorney asked the court to turn 
Bellinger over to the Oneida Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
He was then taken before New Hartford Justice James Van Slyke and was charged 
with being a fugitive from justice, Brockway said, and then sent to the County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
During the court proceedings, Bellinger "did say he desires to return to 
California," Brockway said.
