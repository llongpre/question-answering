Alma Pixley Dean, believed to be the oldest native of Orange County, died 
Tuesday morning in an El Toro board-and-care home. She was 101. 
</P>
<P>
Because she was the oldest known county resident living at the time, her 
signature was placed on the new cornerstone of the renovated old Orange County 
Courthouse last November. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean was born in Orange on July 6, 1888, when the unincorporated town was 
still part of Los Angeles County, city historian Phil Brigandi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her father, D.C. Pixley, was probably the most prominent businessman and 
banker in Orange at the turn of the century," Brigandi said. Dewitt Clinton 
Pixley ran a general store and helped found the first bank, the First Christian 
Church of Orange and the defunct Orange News, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pixley Street in Orange is named after the family. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean was one of the original students when Orange Union High School opened 
its doors in 1903 in a store in downtown Orange, Brigandi said. She went on to 
graduate from Stanford University, an unusual accomplishment for a woman at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was always interested in education," said her daughter, Virginia 
Arthur, 69, a resident of Dana Point. "It was important to have her two girls 
and her grandchildren go to college." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother kept active until the end of her life, Arthur said. At age 101, she 
attended a reunion in June of five generations of the Pixley family. They 
gathered at the Big Bear cabin D.C. Pixley had built in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
"The family reunion was a great tribute to my parents," Arthur said. Her mother 
"had a great feeling of family continuity." 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was proud of her family heritage," Arthur said. "Her parents were 
prominent, but she never considered that a big deal. She had a lot of family 
pride and she imparted that to all of us, the cohesiveness and the loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother could recite every family member's birthday, Arthur said. "This was 
children, great grandchildren and all their spouses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the reunion, Mrs. Dean's husband, Argus, died from heart problems 
at age 98. They were married in 1917 in Illinois, where the two met. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Argus passed away, Alma just faded away after that," said Brigandi, who 
knew Mrs. Dean for several years because of their mutual interest in city 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean was the last of her generation of the Pixley family, he said. Her two 
brothers and two sisters, several of whom lived in Orange, have all died, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-story family house where the Pixley children grew up is still 
standing on the corner of Palm and Olive streets in Orange, Brigandi said. Her 
father's general store remains standing, also, but the facade has been altered, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
D.C. Pixley was a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors for one term 
in 1900. During his term, the old Orange County Courthouse was built and 
Pixley's signature was in the cornerstone that was removed last November. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean died of natural causes at the Regency Hearthside Home. A memorial 
service will be held for her at 2 p.m. Nov. 5 at Shannon-Donegan Mortuary in 
Orange.
