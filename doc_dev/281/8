mother deliver his baby sister.;    "I told my mother to push and she got
tired. So I told her to wait a little longer," said Robert Berry of Detroit,

<TEXT>     "He helped me out a lot," Angela Berry said from her bed at Samaritan
Hospital, where she and the baby were reported doing fine. "He was calming me
down and telling me to push.";    Berry awoke about 5 a.m. with labor pains.
Robert telephoned Angela's mother, Rosa Williams, who lives next door.
Williams called for an ambulance, and the operator told her she would tell
Williams what to do if the ambulance didn't come in time.;    "I got panicked
and I passed the phone to Robert," said Williams, 47, who ran out of the
house. "I was about to faint. It was too much for me.";    Robert took the
phone and listened to the operator. He also got a blanket for the baby. The
ambulance came about seven minutes later, after the baby arrived.;    "I was
shocked," Berry said. "Most kids, they would get upset.";    "I like to help,"
Robert said. "Especially when you're having a baby."  </TEXT>
