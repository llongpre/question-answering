More than 200 mourners, including friends and relatives wearing T-shirts 
adorned with his name, said goodby Saturday to Gabriel Soto, the 13-year-old 
victim of a shooting that occurred during a one-sided version of Russian 
roulette. 
</P>
<P>
After a Mass at Our Lady of Perpetual Hope Catholic Church, the boy's body was 
buried on a windy, steep hillside at Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall, 
where the crying of his family and the strains of traditional mourning songs 
were almost drowned out by noise from the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel's mother, Olga Soto, broke down and stretched over the coffin as the 
graveside ceremony drew to a close, and mourners and pallbearers placed white 
carnations on the ground. A girl wept into a handkerchief that enfolded 
Gabriel's school photo. 
</P>
<P>
At graveside rites, Father Robert Rankin, an associate pastor at Our Lady of 
Perpetual Hope, said: "Human life in God's mind is complete, no matter how long 
it lasts." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Soto had been one of the last family members to see the boy alive, as he 
was leaving the family's small home on Arch Street near the railroad tracks in 
Newhall on Tuesday morning to visit a friend. His classes at Placerita Junior 
High School did not begin until 1 p.m. She had told him not to be late.

Drawn Into Deadly Game 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel and a 14-year-old friend went to an apartment in Valencia where another 
classmate lived. Authorities believe that the third boy, also 14, drew the 
other two into a deadly game of Russian roulette, using a gun owned by his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have said the third boy always held the 
gun, allegedly pointing it at his own head and then at the other two boys. The 
suspect pleaded not guilty Friday to a murder charge, and a June 21 hearing 
date has been set. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
At his funeral, Gabriel was remembered as a fun-loving boy who joked, rode his 
bicycle around the neighborhood and played games "just like any 12- or 
13-year-old boy would do," said Francisco Orona, 17, a neighbor. "He was just 
like a little brother to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
He had had some difficulties at school, but family members said his grades were 
improving, and a special school seemed to be making a difference. His father, 
Edward Soto Sr., an auto mechanic whose specialty is electronics, said that 
Gabriel always had wanted to help him work on cars and that his son was saving 
his money to buy a motor bike. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Valenzuela, another mourner, said: "We're all like one big family" in 
the neighborhood where the Sotos have lived for 15 years. Valenzuela wore one 
of the T-shirts, which also had the date of Gabriel's death and the words "In 
Memory" across the back.
