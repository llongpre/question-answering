<TEXT>  HarperCollins, 277 pp., $19.95; LOS ANGELES: Capital of the Third World; By
David Rieff; Simon &amp; Schuster, 259 pp., $20; LOS Angeles is so big now, so
filled with the effluvia of modern life -- people, cars, pollution, crime --
that we tend to forget what attracted anyone there in the first place. It was
beautiful. After a visit in 1847, Army Capt. William Tecumseh Sherman wrote of
spending "several days very pleasantly in . . . the chief pueblo of the south,
famous for its grapes, fruits and wines. . . . Every house had its inclosure
of vineyard, which resembled a miniature orchard. . . . The climate was so
moderate that oranges, figs, pomegranates, etc., were generally to be found in
every yard. . . .";    Starting in the last quarter of the 19th century,
Yankee promoters who had moved there made certain that all the country knew
about its charms. They saw the Los Angeles basin, as well as the San Fernando
and San Gabriel valleys, stretching into the distance like blank checks,
payable to those who owned the vast parcels, with amounts to be filled in by
future residents and their commercial speculations.;    Except for those who
are in the business of selling it, Los Angeles has always been a difficult
place to describe, primarily because writers in the United States are mostly
from New York, the center of American media, and New Yorkers have always been
horrified by Los Angeles. It is the antithesis of urban culture as defined by
Europe and the American East, and worst of all, one of its major industries,
entertainment, doesn't take writers seriously: They're the ones who can be
lured away from their newspapers or magazines for pin money.;   Two new books
look at Los Angeles. One examines what is today its most famous (or, better,
infamous) brutal subculture; the other attempts to define both the city's
present, and also its future. The first succeeds; the second assuredly does
not.;   Heard on the street; Leon Bing's "Do or Die," about black kids in Los
Angeles street gangs, is a brilliant piece of work, reportage about the lives
of the disadvantaged that approaches the artistry of Dickens' novels. Bing
went into the ghetto, talked with gang members (as well as their parents,
parole officers, and workers in the juvenile detention centers that are often
these kids' first stop on a long road through the California penal system),
and wrote down what they told her.;   That sounds simple, until you think
about it: a white woman (a former fashion model, at that) going into black
neighborhoods to talk with kids whose very existence has put a pall of fear
over the city as palpable as its smog.;   Her ear and eye are acute, the
latter for the precise detail, the former to get these kids to tell her their
stories with a candor that sometimes makes the reader shudder. Best of all,
Bing has the good sense to stand out of the way and let the stories speak for
themselves.;   They are told by children who deal crack, who learn how to
murder at the onset of puberty, whose epic battles over turf have spread into
white neighborhoods, who kill and are killed so frequently that their life
expectancy is about the same as a medieval foot-soldier's.;   Their talk is
remarkably free of cant. They are matter-of-fact about the only discipline --
the rules of the gang -- they know and obey, and they are not at all
self-pitying about the wretched hand they have been dealt in life. None of the
young men Bing talked to lives in a home with his natural father, which helps
explain why the gangs are as important as they are.;   One cannot and should
not sentimentalize the gangs by pretending they impose honor as it is defined
outside those mean streets. The Crips (who dress in blue) battle the Bloods
(who dress in red), but there is internecine warfare between various Crip
"sets" (individual gangs), and always the possibility that one gang member
will not help another member of his own gang at a crucial moment.;   This is a
book in which the issues of gangs and crime are raised not as theory but by
the people we meet in its pages. Is there any hope for Faro, whose mother died
of a drug overdose and whose grandmother is addicted to crack? Or for Hart,
whose mother is on crack, and who seems, for a brief moment, to be trying to
find a life outside the gangs? Why wasn't Monster Kody lucky enough to cross
paths with probation officer Jim Galipeau or juvenile camp counselor A.C.
Jones, or would it have made a difference if he had?;   It is a measure of
Bing's talent that we care about the answers to these questions, that we no
longer see these kids, for all the explicit danger in their murderous ways, as
only the menacing, impersonal "they.";   You may, as I did, think that the
last thing you want to read about is the world of Los Angeles street gangs. Be
assured that the reward of "Do or Die," for all the sadness in its pages, is
that of having read a superb book.;   Perhaps the laws of physics apply to
book publishing: For every good book published, there must be an equal and
opposite reaction. That would explain David Rieff's "Los Angeles: Capital of
the Third World," as inferior a piece of goods as Bing's is splendid.;   Rieff
set out to explain Los Angeles, to give the big picture of the place. That's
the sort of conceit that catches the imagination of the New York book editor,
the chance to send someone out to the farthest reach of civilization and bring
back an explanation of what the natives are all about.;   The book is
inaccurate in its details, both historical and contemporary. Putting E.H.
Harriman (who controlled the Southern Pacific Railroad after Collis
Huntington) at the Santa Fe is like writing that Henry Luce was the head of
the New York Times. (I'm trying to create a parallel understandable even to
the most myopic New Yorker.) Rieff says that "no one had the slightest reason
to believe that L.A. would prove as enticing as San Francisco," which is to
prove his utter ignorance of California history. People were touting Southern
California in general, and Los Angeles in particular, as early as Sherman's
visit, as quoted above. San Francisco's dominance was established only with
the extraction of $300 million worth of ore from the Sierra Nevada during the
Gold Rush.;   There is no "Pacific Northwest" Airline flying to Tokyo. It was
not the city of Santa Monica, but Los Angeles, that blocked Armand Hammer's
scheme to drill for oil next to the beach. Rieff regards mini-malls both as an
aesthetic stain on the landscape (true) and as evidence of residents' greed
(making money from their construction) and civic lethargy in allowing them to
be built. In fact, while it took longer than it should, the Los Angeles city
council did place restrictions on the building of new mini-malls.;   I loathe
L.A.; Details, details! What about the big picture? Rieff paints it, dripping
condescension. He is particularly harsh in describing the (mostly white,
mostly well-off) residents of L.A.'s west side, who employ (mostly brown, not
well-off) servants without considering what life will be like in a few years
when brown, yellow and black faces will outnumber white faces two or three to
one in Los Angeles. Is it really news that rich people hire the poor to work
for them, or is Rieff unhappy because he's accustomed to the style of
Manhattan's Upper East Side, where rich New Yorkers prefer their "help,"
especially nannies, to be from Europe? Ah! There I go again, worrying about
details.;   The big picture here is that Rieff starts his book with all his
friends' lame jokes about Los Angeles, and ends it by comparing life in Los
Angeles with that in the Third World. Then he flies back to New York, where
what was once the premier shopping street in the world, Fifth Avenue, is now
so filled with street vendors of cheap merchandise that it resembles a North
African souk.;   Reading this book, I knew how the natives felt when
confronted by some 19th-century Brit, taking notes from his elephant for the
paper he'd deliver to the Explorer's Club.;   If there were real justice in
Los Angeles, there would have been a meeting between Rieff and some real
Angelenos, say the Crips' Rollin' 90s, or the Bloods' Six-Deuce Brims. That
would have been worth reading, but only if Bing wrote about it. (box)  </TEXT>
