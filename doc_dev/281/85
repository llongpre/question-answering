<LEADPARA>  SYLVIA Weller Carberry is 52 years old. She lives in Northern California and
her life is fixed and comfortable. She is searching, though, for someone who
holds memories of her past.;   Usually when you hear "desperately searching"
stories, they're about birth parents or ex-lovers. But Sylvia's story is
different, and perhaps one that will become more universal.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sylvia is looking for her nanny, the woman who helped her mother care for
her from the time she was 18 months old until she was 3 1/2.;   "I don't
remember much about her," Sylvia said, "only that we were very good friends.";
  She realizes this is ancient history, but it is her personal ancient
history, which can't help but have tendrils that have a long reach and grasp.;
  Her search came about after she began studying psychology and delving into
how the pieces of our pasts fit into the big picture. Next to her parents,
Gail Woodard was the person closest to her; a seminal figure in her formative
years.;   She wants to know more about her.;   She thinks that by knowing more
about her, she'll know more about herself.;   Sylvia ran classified newspaper
ads in search of Gail. If they don't pan out, she's planning to write to every
Woodard in the Los Angeles phone books.;   Her memories are sketchy, but here
are the facts.;   Gail went to work for the Wellers in 1939. The family lived
on Crest Drive in Los Angeles and, later, in Hermosa Beach.;   Fred Weller,
Sylvia's father, was an attorney. Her mother, Alice, was a homemaker.;   Gail
is black; the Wellers are white.;   Gail was 18 years old when she went to
work for the Wellers.;   "She lived in. She did cooking and everything,"
Sylvia said. "She must have been very capable.";   The best memory Sylvia can
muster is about the time when her sister was born.;   "I remember watching
from an upstairs window," Sylvia said. "It was the day my mother brought my
baby sister home from the hospital. I have a strong sense of a person standing
there and talking to me. She was holding back the curtain. That must have been
Gail.";   Gail left in 1941. Sylvia was told that she left because the war had
made a better job available. She thinks it odd that her memories are so
vague.;   "I don't think my family was very psychologically oriented," she
said. "I don't think they worked very hard to make me understand her leaving.
I think I was probably very, very sad when she left.";   Everything she knows
is hearsay. Her mother told her that Gail was cheerful and always made her
laugh. She has a snapshot to go by, and a sample of Gail's handwriting. These
will probably help her if and when Gail or her family tries to get in touch.; 
 Sylvia has had one response to her ad. Someone claiming to be Gail's grandson
called and provided the address of a post office box for a woman he said
remembers taking care of a little girl at the beach.;   "I don't know how
excited to be," said an obviously excited Sylvia.;   She has drafted a letter
and plans to send it. She doesn't know what she'll say if it is Gail, but she
knows what she wants to hear.;   She wants to hear stories. She wants to hear
the things an 18-year-old might remember that an 18-month-old would not.;  
She wants a piece of her past from a woman who was in it.;   Sometimes we
don't just pass through others' lives and on into the night.;   Whoever cares
for our kids -- a nanny, a teacher, a day-care worker -- can mean more,
provide more memories, than we ever realize at the time.;   I hope every
parent who hires someone for this all-important spot recognizes that a leaving
can be a loss.;   I hope Sylvia finds Gail. I want to hear those stories, too.  </TEXT>
