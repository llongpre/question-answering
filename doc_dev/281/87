The blood has dried on the living room sofa where 8-year-old Jacqueline 
Aguilera was nearly killed by shots that suddenly slammed through the walls and 
door of her parents' South-Central Los Angeles apartment early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard shots and then her screams," the child's uncle, Franklin Vallecillo, 
24, said, pointing out four large holes in the front door and walls, from 
bullets shot by unseen assailants for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
"She was screaming, 'Daddy, what happened to me? What hit me?' " her father, 
David Aguilera, 28, said. "She was covered in blood." 
</P>
<P>
The long-haired child, whose dancing eyes and big grin shone from a large 
photograph on a wall of the East 54th Street apartment, had been seated on a 
red velvet sofa a few feet from the front door. She had fallen asleep watching 
television, her uncle and father said, when she was wounded in the cheek, arm 
and legs. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center said the child was 
in stable condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Dennis Scherr said the family, immigrants from 
Nicaragua, had no known gang affiliations and the shooting seemed to have 
occurred without motive. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no witnesses," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been here four years, with no problems," Vallecillo said. "Nothing ever 
happened. Never." 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting started, Jacqueline's father, who is a construction worker, 
and 7-year-old brother, Dennis, were asleep in one bedroom and Vallecillo was 
asleep in another, he said. The child's 26-year-old mother, Savaluz, a postal 
worker, was at work. 
</P>
<P>
The shots rang out shortly after 12:30 a.m., Vallecillo said. When he ran to 
the living room, the uncle said he saw that Jacqueline had fallen from the sofa 
to the linoleum floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked her up and put her on a bed and tried to calm her until the 
paramedics came,." he said. 
</P>
<P>
The small three-bedroom apartment had been converted from the garage of a 
two-story apartment building. Thin wooden panels of garage doors make up most 
of the outer wall of the $400-a-month unit, which faces a back alley. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors contacted Thursday said they did not know the Aguilera family. 
</P>
<P>
Even though gangs are common to the area, "it's real quiet," Lupe Estrada, 58, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, another resident said a car "throwing bullets" drove through the block 
about half an hour before the shooting of the child. 
</P>
<P>
The building where the Aguileras live is a few doors from the location of the 
1974 police shootout with members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, when 
publishing heiress Patty Hearst was a fugitive.
