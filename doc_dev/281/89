   Rusty Hamer, the child actor in Danny
Thomas' popular 1950s and '60s television series ``Make Room for
Daddy,'' has died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. He
was 42.
   ``He hasn't really been happy since his early 20s,'' said
Hamer's brother, John. ``But he didn't show any signs of this
happening. It was just all of a sudden.''
   Hamer said his brother suffered debilitating back pain but
refused to see a doctor.
   He apparently shot himself in the head Wednesday with a
.357-caliber revolver, said Chief Detective Robert McCullough of
the Beauregard Parish Sheriff's Office.
   Thomas, reached by telephone Friday at his home in Los Angeles,
said he and Hamer had ``a marvelous association.''
   ``I raised him. I got him when he was about 5{ years old on the
TV show. His real father passed away not too long after that. I
remember him saying to me, crying, `You're the only daddy I have
left now.'
   ``There is no question in my mind he was the best boy actor in
comedy I ever met in my life.''
   Thomas said they kept in touch for a while after the show ended
but lost touch after he moved to Louisiana.
   John Hamer found his brother's body Thursday night in the
trailer where he lived near DeRidder, about 40 miles north of Lake
Charles in southwestern Louisiana.
   On the TV series, which ran from 1953 to 1964, Rusty Hamer
played the precocious child Rusty. Danny Thomas played his father,
a nightclub singer and comedian. Marjorie Lord played Thomas'
second wife, Kathy, and Angela Cartwright played her daughter,
Linda.
   It was one of television's most durable and popular situation
comedies. Most of the cast, including Hamer, returned in 1970-71
with a sequel sitcom, ``Make Room For Granddaddy,'' in which Rusty
was a married medical student. It lasted one season.
   Rusty Hamer got his first film role at the age of 5, appeared in
several Abbot and Costello films, and has a star on Hollywood's
Walk of Fame, his brother said.
   At age 20 Hamer was working for a Los Angeles messenger service
and was bitter and depressed, his brother said. After moving to
southwest Louisiana, his jobs included delivering a newspaper,
working offshore for Exxon, and occasional work at his brother's
restaurant.
   John Hamer, 47, said he began acting before Rusty but left
Hollywood when he was 17.
   ``I did not enjoy the industry. I felt the people in it _ the
majority were confused in their own lives,'' he said.
   John Hamer said he had moved to DeRidder to open a cafe and
Rusty moved there in 1976 to be near their mother, who had moved in
with John. He said he thought their mother's ill health took a toll
on his brother.
   The only survivors are his brother and their mother, Dorothy
Hamer, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is in a nursing
home. He will be cremated without services, according to Colonial
Funeral Home in DeRidder.
