An 11-year-old girl was killed and her aunt was critically wounded in the 
Pico-Union area west of downtown Los Angeles when they were struck by gunfire 
apparently intended for gang members standing nearby, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Jasmine Guevara Saturday night was one of six gang-related 
homicides recorded over the weekend in Los Angeles County, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the girl, her 14-year-old sister, Melda, and aunt Blanca 
Guevara, 42, were going home from a liquor store where they had bought candy 
and soda when several shotgun blasts were fired at 9:30 p.m. in front of an 
apartment house in the 1800 block of Orchard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire came from a passing auto, perhaps a Camaro. Melda Guevara was not 
wounded but several pellets hit Jasmine Guevara and her aunt, investigators 
said. The girl was pronounced dead at the scene. Her aunt was was reported in 
critical condition at County USC-Medical Center on Sunday with neck wounds, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive for the shooting is in all likelihood the usual gang retribution 
drive-by shooting and the victims were innocent victims," police Lt. Rob 
Watters said, adding that there were no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it was firecrackers," said Melda. "Then I looked down and 
I saw my aunt lying on top of my sister. I didn't want to believe my sister was 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, who heard the gunfire, rushed outside and found Melda screaming at 
her dead sister, "Don't die! don't die!" 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen pellets crashed into the downstairs apartment of Jose and Maria 
Vedal, who were watching television. Bullet fragments damaged kitchen furniture 
and shattered a mirror in the living room. "Luckily, we were all on the floor 
and none of us got hit," Jose Vedal said.

Shooting at Gas Station 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a 16-year-old suspected gang member was fatally shot Saturday night 
as he stood next to his car in a gasoline station at Florence Avenue and 
Figueroa Street in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Stacey Koon said Jesus Gutierrez was shot just before 9 p.m. by a gunman 
believed to be a member of a rival street gang. Gutierrez died two hours later 
at an Inglewood hospital. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Gunshots were fired in a fight between two rival gangs on a San Pedro street 
corner at about 11:15 p.m. Saturday, killing Ronald Rand, 28, of Long Beach, 
investigators said. Rand was not believed to have been a gang member, but his 
companions were, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Gutierrez, 28, was in critical condition after being stabbed by gang 
members at a party early Saturday at Treasure Island Park in Downey, police 
said. A 15-year-old boy was arrested in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspected gang members, Luis Chavez, 21, and Jose Leon, 18, were 
killed in separate incidents Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez was run over by a car and killed as he tried to run away from a fight 
that broke out in Bell, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Leon was killed and two others were wounded in a drive-by shooting in 
South-Central Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident with gang overtones, a man was killed Sunday after two 
robbery suspects led police on a high-speed chase and then slammed head-on into 
the victim's car. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the collision at 49th Street and Broadway was Carlos Diaz, 24, of Los 
Angeles, police said. The driver of the car being pursued, Anthony Francisco, 
22, was booked on suspicion of murder in the jail ward at County-USC Medical 
Center, where he was in serious condition. His associate escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy (Diaz) was totally innocent," Sgt. David Young said. "And then, with 
him lying there, the paramedics cut the suspect's (Francisco) shirt off to 
treat him and there were his gang insignias." 
</P>
<P>
Young said officers had tried to stop Francisco's car on Normandie Avenue after 
a license check showed the car had been used in a recent robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, LAPD officers arrested four men and two teen-age boys, all 
believed to be gang members, on suspicion of attempted murder in the shooting 
of a woman at the Chevy Chase Park Recreation Center in the Atwater area. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Montanez, 56, of Los Angeles, the mother of 10 children, was hit in the 
wrist and was treated at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Paul Herman said the woman confronted the suspects, who were creating a 
disturbance at the center, and asked them to leave. They returned later and 
shot her, he said.
