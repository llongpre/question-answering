DRUGS: THE PROBLEMS WILL BE COMPOUNDED IF WE FAIL TO SEE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS AN

By most accounts, the No. 1 crisis facing American cities is drug abuse. "For 
about 75 years," writes Howard Moody in the journal Christianity and Crisis, 
"we've been trying to prevent some of our citizens from using, abusing, 
importing and selling opiates and euphoriants. So far, the only real effect is 
more addicts, more drugs and more murder and mayhem on the 'mean streets' of 
our cities and, more recently, in our small towns." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, there have been about 750,000 drug-related arrests 
nationwide. Interestingly, 75% of them were not for dealing and selling, but 
for possession. Federal as well as local law-enforcement efforts are largely 
aimed at reducing demand. While this is certainly appropriate, failing to 
recognize that demand constitutes an unprecedented public-health crisis rather 
than a law-enforcement monopoly will only compound current problems. Public 
policy on addiction and abuse must be radically refocused. A federal report 
fingers street-gang members, often the victims of economic deprivation and 
inadequate education, as the entrepreneurs of the underground crack economy. 
</P>
<P>
Members of state and federal courts felt compelled recently to comment that the 
overburdened courts should be among the last resorts in the fight against 
drugs; they call for much more education, treatment, early intervention and 
research. Indeed, this addresses the demand issue in a more effective way. The 
punitive approach is too costly and reaps too few positive results. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is particularly sensitive for the California Supreme Court, which 
recently ruled against a mother whose child was born addicted to illegal drugs. 
With this attempt to protect the child, the court has cleared the way for the 
denial of custody to a mother who abuses drugs. 
</P>
<P>
This has far-reaching implications for the health-crisis dimension of drug 
abuse, documented by a recent report on infant mortality and low-birth weights. 
At a time when infant-mortality rates are declining nationwide, they are 
increasing in Los Angeles County. This phenomenon is most apparent among 
African American women and is traceable to the rise in crack cocaine addiction 
and the shortage of obstetric and prenatal care. The percentage of babies born 
weighing less than 5.5 pounds -- a key predictor of mortality and disability -- 
rose 17% overall and 32% among African American women in the county. 
</P>
<P>
This situation looks even grimmer in view of the paucity of services for 
addicted mothers. The possibility of the courts' removing children from 
addicted mothers only makes matters more ominous; as many as 2,500 drug-baby 
cases could enter Los Angeles-area courts annually. In the rush to criminalize 
everything and everyone associated with illicit drug use, Los Angeles could 
easily become part of the latest rash of copycat criminal prosecutions of 
drug-addicted mothers charged with endangering their fetuses -- three-dozen 
women have faced this ordeal nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
For African Americans generally, the problem gets worse because of the 
disproportionately low number of treatment centers in the very communities hit 
hardest by crack. According to Karen Bass, a physician assistant and clinical 
instructor at USC, since 1986, the year of the crack explosion, more than 50% 
of the 5,312 crack-related cases in the county involved African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of these cases came from the county's Southeast Planning Area, which 
had only three community-based treatment centers and one private provider, the 
lowest number of all six county regional planning areas. 
</P>
<P>
In light of these conditions, the African American community in Los Angeles has 
taken it upon itself to organize against what appears to be an intractable 
menace. In an unprecedented two-day conference today and Saturday, every sector 
of the community will concentrate on how to confront this crisis with more 
conviction, clarity and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after the successful Crack Cocaine and the African American Family 
Conference in San Francisco last year, this conference hopes to launch an 
extensive network of providers, community activists, corporate leaders, 
educators, social service agencies, media representatives, elected officials, 
parents, ex-users, clergy and law enforcement officials to attack this problem. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerned about one of the most serious crises to face the nation, this 
city and the African American community in particular refuse to be resigned to 
these miserable conditions and will not rely largely on a punitive approach. 
Instead, the call is for a comprehensive approach that rescues this nation from 
the catastrophic consequences of prevailing policies and arrests the problem 
that has gripped the lives of the guilty and innocent alike.
