   Charges were dropped Friday against a mother
who was the first to be charged under a new state law that holds
parents responsible for their children's gang activity, officials
said.
   Gloria Williams, 37, a South Central Los Angeles resident, was
charged May 1 with failure to exercise reasonable care, supervision
or protection of minor children.
   Her 14-year-old son, an alleged gang member, is accused in the
group rape of a 12-year-old girl who was abducted from Ms. Williams'
back yard.
   Further investigation showed that Ms. Williams took ``skilled
parenting'' classes at a nearby youth center and received a
certificate after she completed 30 hours of course work.
   ``While we will not hesitate to prosecute parents who demonstrate
a lack of interest in correcting their children's behavior, this law
was not designed to prosecute parents who are making an effort to
control their children,'' said City Attorney James Hahn.
   ``The new evidence we discovered in this case indicates that Ms.
Williams was making that effort,'' Hahn said in a news release.
   Ms. Williams, who works as an assembly line supervisor at an
electronics plant, told the Los Angeles Times in a published
interview: ``How could the police know about all the things I have
done to try to help my son?''
   She was arrested at home on April 29 after a search of her modest
home showed snapshots of her son in gang regalia and one the home's
bedroom walls filled with graffiti.
   Ms. Williams, also the mother of a 20-year-old daughter and an
8-year-old boy, maintained that her teen-age son ``is a good boy and
we just want him home.'' She refused to talk about the charges
leveled against her son for fear of incriminating him.
   ``We knew they didn't have a case,'' Ms. Williams' attorney Daye
Shinn said. ``I think that they didn't do their investigation. They
just panicked and made a big story out of this.''
   The charges were under a provision of the 1988 Street Terrorism
Enforcement and Prevention Act passed by the Legislature to combat
gang-related crimes. If she was convicted, she could have faced a
year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500.
