   Three boys removed from a religious
commune by court order and returned to their fathers, at least
temporarily, had been physically and emotionally abused by cult
leaders, the fathers say.
   Deputies surprised devotees of the Tony and Susan Alamo
Foundation communes in Saugus on Thursday, reuniting the children
with their fathers before a custody hearing in Orange County
Superior Court.
   ``There was a lot of confusion and cries of anguish from the
adults,'' Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. Larry Brakebush said.
``There were people everywhere, people running around the grounds
shouting.''
   The boys' mothers weren't at the Alamo Holy Christian Church
commune when the raid took place.
   Alamo gained notoriety when he vowed that his wife Susan, who
died of cancer in 1982, would be resurrected. He kept her embalmed
body on display for six months while followers prayed.
   The custody dispute involves brothers Carey and Robert Miller of
Orange, who were banished from the commune after 15 years as
members following a disagreement over control of a trucking firm
they operated in Arkansas.
   ``My wife is absolutely and completely brainwashed by Tony Alamo
to the extent that she has now consented to live with another man
as husband and wife,'' Carey Miller, 34, said in a sworn statement.
``I am given to understand that I was now an outsider and would be
prevented from seeing my wife and children.''
   The men filed court statements contending the children were
abused, physically and emotionally, by their mothers and cult
leaders, and that they feared their sons would soon be taken to
Canada if they didn't act to regain custody. Both have begun
divorce proceedings.
   They also said they were wrongly separated from their families
after a business dispute with church leaders, contentions the
commune's founder denied.
   ``They abandoned their wives and children, embezzled money from
the church and lied in court about it,'' Alamo said Thursday in a
telephone interview from New York.
   The foundation has sued the brothers for allegedly emptying the
trucking company's bank accounts when they left the commune. Alamo
said commune members agree to sign over all property to the church,
something the brothers balked at doing with their trucking company.
   Judge Ronald Owen granted the Millers temporary custody of the
boys, ages 11, 9 and 4, until an informal mediation session April 6
and a court hearing five days later to hear arguments about
permanent custody.
   Attorneys for the two mothers, Carol Ann and Susan Miller, and
the church said the women were in New York City selling clothes
made at the commmune northwest of Los Angeles.
   The Miller brothers said they fled the commune in fear of their
lives in September after an altercation with Alamo and church
officers.
   ``I never threatened anybody,'' said Alamo.
   Alamo and his wife started preaching on Hollywood's Sunset Strip
in 1966. They attracted numerous young followers and formed a
commune in Saugus, later moving it to Arkansas. Recently they moved
their headquarters back to California but still have centers in
Chicago, Miami, Arizona and Arkansas.
