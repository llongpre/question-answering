<LEADPARA>  A 19-year-old Army private just back from combat in the Persian Gulf was
killed Tuesday in a gang-related, drive-by shooting here that also left his
cousin dead and two neighbors wounded.;    Cesar Gardea, on leave after a
six-month tour of duty in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, had arrived at his cousin's
house Monday for a homecoming party and Fourth of July celebration this
weekend, family members said.  </LEADPARA>

19-YEAR-OLD WAS VISITING COUSIN'S HOUSE FOR
HOMECOMING PARTY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In letters to his girlfriend, who lives in Baldwin Park, east of Los
Angeles, Gardea told of being a tank driver on the front lines and said that
he feared for his life.;    "He saw the missiles and everything . . . bodies
and stuff," said Lorena Limon, 18. "He told me that he loved me and that he
hoped to live through it and come back and see me.";    But on his first night
back at the home where he spent his high school years, Gardea was gunned down
in the front yard by a passing car filled with suspected gang members,
sheriff's investigators said.;    "It was kind of like coming home to say
goodbye," Limon said.;    Armando Ortiz, Gardea's uncle, said, "This man, or
boy, is in action over there then comes back here and is shot. I think it is
more dangerous to be here.";    During Operation Desert Storm, 145 U.S. troops
died in combat. Last year in Los Angeles County, there were 1,962 homicides --
about 163 a month.;    Gardea had been playing billiards with several friends
in the back of his cousin's house, where he intended to stay before returning
to a German military base July 5. Shortly after midnight, as he went to the
front yard to say good-night to friends, a dark, foreign-made compact car
drove past several times, investigators said.;    On the third trip, the car's
headlights were turned off and at least five shots exploded from what sounded
like a .45-caliber handgun, according to relatives. Gardea, an only child
whose mother lives in Reno, died of multiple chest wounds about an hour
later.;    His cousin, Pablo Paez, 17, died of chest wounds later that
morning. Officers said that neither of the young men was affiliated with a
gang, but friends and family said that Paez dressed like a gang member,
although they did not believe that he was heavily involved in gang
activities.;    "He just dressed like a gangster," said Paez's cousin, Junior
Ortiz, 15. "But that's it. He had his head straight.";    Two neighbors
standing with them were also wounded in the attack.;    No arrests have been
made and the suspects have not been identified.;    Gardea joined the military
soon after his high school graduation in June 1990. His girlfriend, who is
studying law enforcement at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, described him
as a fun-loving young man who hoped that the Army would provide direction in
his life.;    "He really didn't know much about what he was going to do," said
Limon, adding that the service was a way to "figure out his goals and stuff.";
   In December, Gardea wrote to her from the 21st Replacement Detachment at
the Kilborne Kaserne base in Schwetzingen, Germany, saying that he expected to
be shipped to the gulf sometime between Christmas and New Year's Day.;    Once
in the Persian Gulf, he was sent to the front lines, the giddiness of his
training experiences gave way to the horrors of combat, he said in letters
home. He was given a big, heavy "Rambo gun," and "did a lot of shooting . . .
but he didn't think he hit anybody," Limon recalled him as saying.;    "He was
scared, very scared of dying," she said. "He said if he had known he was going
to Saudi Arabia, he would never have joined."  </TEXT>
