OUTRAGE OVER THE INNOCENTS;

<P>
VIOLENCE: WHEN FOUR CHILDREN DIED OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS IN NEW YORK CITY, THE 
ENTIRE CITY ROSE UP IN ANGER AND PAIN. BUT WHEN FOUR YOUNGSTERS DIED IN L.A. 
AND ORANGE COUNTIES, THE REACTION WAS FAR MORE RESTRAINED. WHY THE DIFFERENCE?

<P>
The image of 9-year-old Veronica Corales peered from New York newsstands with 
large dark eyes and a smile so innocent that she could subdue even the most 
shrill tabloid's front page. Still, the headlines screamed: 
</P>
<P>
STRAY SHOT HITS GIRL . . . HER GREAT ADVENTURE ENDS IN TRAGEDY . . . SLEEPING 
GIRL SHOT IN HEAD. 
</P>
<P>
So began a wave of tragedy this summer, heightened by media attention, that 
baffled even those New Yorkers accustomed to living with violence. Little 
children shot and killed by random gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
By August, the city was wrapped up in a collective outrage, shouted in the 
tabloid headlines: 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN IN THE WAR ZONE . . . IT'S NOT DODGE CITY, BUT . . .. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was just a slow news period that slotted little Veronica as the first 
victim of what Newsday later called the "slaughter of innocents." 
</P>
<P>
But more deaths came, one after the other. The ages of the victims became 
impossibly young: A 3-year-old shot as he slept on a fold-out bed; a 
9-month-old killed as he sat in a walker in his grandmother's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The city cried out, to the police, to Mayor David Dinkins: Do something! 
</P>
<P>
But while New York anguished over its "littlest victims," the summer has been 
almost as grisly in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
* A 6-year-old girl was shot by an angry 17-year-old gang member at a birthday 
party in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-year-old Wilmington boy was shot accidentally while he played with a gun 
belonging to his gang-member uncle. 
</P>
<P>
* A 12-year-old boy was shot on a Santa Ana street after a drug deal soured; 
the boy had nothing to do with that deal. 
</P>
<P>
Where, then, is Southern California's outrage -- the headlines, the grief, the 
uproar? Except for the tears of families and friends -- and a few tightly 
written or produced newspaper and TV stories -- Los Angeles and Orange County 
have not reacted with the collective intensity that New Yorkers have. 
</P>
<P>
The anguish is here, as sure as the increase in gang-related crime, police and 
media watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
But, they add, how New York and Los Angeles deal with children's shootings is 
as different as the cities themselves. The reaction, experts say, has been 
affected by such factors as: 
</P>
<P>
* Communities in New York are not separated by miles of interstate. 
</P>
<P>
* Competing tabloid newspapers there sell fast and furious, mostly on 
pedestrian rush-hour streets. 
</P>
<P>
* And, most importantly, although at least four Southern California children 
were fatally shot in one month, the area has not recorded the consecutive tally 
of child shootings -- four dead in nine days -- that sparked New Yorkers' fury. 
</P>
<P>
Where neighborhood violence -- particularly gang violence -- is concerned, it's 
becoming a banner year in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Gang violence, according to figures released last month by the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department, increased 69% in the first eight months of 1990 
over last year. 
</P>
<P>
Overall violent crime, the report says, is up 20%. 
</P>
<P>
And, as always, shootings often involve innocent bystanders -- families who 
learn duck-and-cover techniques the way most Southern Californians practice 
earthquake drills. Marie Felix, of the Gang Violence Reduction Project in East 
Los Angeles, reports that as many as 60% of victims of gang-related crime are 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
In New York so far this year, six of the 16 innocent bystanders killed by 
random bullets were children under 16. In 1988, homicide was the fifth cause of 
death of youngsters 14 and younger in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Although the New York Police Department has no statistics distinguishing 
children intentionally slain and those killed by stray bullets, one police 
spokeswoman suggested that misdirected gunfire accounted for only a handful of 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in Los Angeles County, cases of children struck down by gunfire are 
not filed under the circumstances of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all homicides," said a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
Still, according to coroners in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 91 children 
under 13 were homicide victims in 1989; of these, 30 were killed by gunfire. 
Authorities do not tally how many were gang- or drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
The counting occurs when newspapers and television reporters add up homicide 
totals -- and fuel public outcry by portraying related events as crime waves. 
</P>
<P>
Police here maintain that residents get angry -- and often call their offices 
seeking solutions to violence, whether the crime occurs in their neighborhood 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some apathy (in the public) towards crime, but to what degree, I 
think, depends on the community and the circumstances," said Lt. Robert Helton 
of the Santa Ana Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
With the killing of an innocent child, like Pedro Sanchez Hernandez, 12, in 
Santa Ana Aug. 14,the outcry increases, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, struck down by gunfire stemming from an unsuccessful drug deal, was 
simply walking down his neighborhood street with his brother, Gus, 16. 
</P>
<P>
Gus said he heard someone yell "drive-by" and "I ducked behind a car and I 
yelled for my brother to follow. I saw this car go by and then I heard four 
shots. I looked for my brother and there he was, dead." 
</P>
<P>
"There, the (public's) outcry was obvious to us," Helton said. "As the age of 
the victim decreases, the public speaks louder." 
</P>
<P>
And, it seems, nowhere was it louder this summer than in New York, where the 
killings began to overlap. Hardly was one child buried before the media told of 
another shooting. 
</P>
<P>
To firebrand columnists like Jim Dwyer of Newsday, the children are "a defining 
issue" for New York. "If you're dead to this issue, you're dead to all 
existence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most members of the New York press agree that the wave of public outrage over 
crime was picking up momentum far before Veronica was killed. The succession of 
child killings was "like a tornado touching down," Dwyer said. 
</P>
<P>
New York's three tabloids -- the New York Post, the New York Daily News and 
Newsday -- each repeatedly ran stories about the killings on their front pages. 
As papers that rely heavily on street sales to pedestrians in transit, the 
tabloids are often accused of pulling no stops to sell papers. 
</P>
<P>
But as the killings progressed, even the staid New York Times ran front-page 
stories on the public outrage surrounding the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasters also joined in the coverage. Where the tabloids were "expectedly 
sensational," said Dr. Everette Dennis, director of the Gannett Media Studies 
Center at Columbia University, "television has been breathlessly sensational" 
in covering the same story. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the media may have treated the young victims in so spectacular a 
fashion because other big stories seemed to have run their course, Dennis said. 
There was not much more to report at the time on the Central Park Jogger case; 
Donald Trump's financial woes had become old news; at the same time, the media 
had a heightened interest in the plight of urban children because of the Lisa 
Steinberg child abuse case. 
</P>
<P>
The journalistic gridlock broke with this summer's consecutive killings of 
children, Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, particularly Dinkins, became the media's prime targets. Dwyer, the 
first to ask Dinkins what he would do to protect New York's children from such 
senseless killings as Veronica Corales', said he was frustrated by the mayor's 
"tepid response." 
</P>
<P>
But while columnists made stinging commentaries about the city administration 
and Dinkins took steps -- such as hiring 1,058 new police officers -- the 
violence continued. 
</P>
<P>
While crime -- random drive-by shootings, in particular -- has become a big, 
poignant even topic of news coverage in Los Angeles, there are major 
differences between this market and New York, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief differences is geographic sprawl. Southern Californians do not 
live shoulder-to-shoulder and are not confronted with competing tabloid 
newspapers; when reading about crime in other neighborhoods, they may feel as 
if it is happening in someplace far removed. 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of outcry here does not reflect a lack of media attention to 
children's shooting deaths, said Edwin Guthman, a USC journalism professor. 
"We're dealing with two different cities," he said. "My impression is that Los 
Angeles has been given a lot of local media coverage to these shootings, 
especially when drive-bys involve innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
While the amount of public outcry can be related to the amount of media 
coverage given gang warfare, Guthman said, "I don't think Los Angeles feels as 
if it has been slighted. I'm certainly quite conscious of a lot of sad stories 
in this area. . . . I don't think we care any less about it than New York." 
</P>
<P>
Said Santa Ana police Lt. Helton: "What's played up in the news can bring the 
problem to the forefront, be the igniter of public outcry. After some of our 
recent violence, I wouldn't be surprised to see outcry escalate, with the right 
kind of rallying point. Here though, that particular case -- or cases -- hasn't 
come forward. We're fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
The random shootings that so often claim the lives of children are on the 
increase largely because the gangs have demonstrated that they no longer care 
about who gets in their way, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
What Helton and other law enforcement officials, see as a growing danger is an 
increasing lack of remorse in gang members and drug dealers, who rarely stop to 
decide who should and should not be shot. 
</P>
<P>
"From my experience, they (gang members) have very little if any remorse for 
innocent victims. When they are looking for somebody and an innocent bystander 
happens to wander in their path, there is no concern," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles, neighborhood gangs once followed a time-honored tradition 
of not involving innocent lives in their street wars. But at the Gang Violence 
Reduction Project, activists are noticing that (and other traditions) are 
beginning to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, from her work counseling current and former gang members in East Los 
Angeles, has noticed that "things are evolving," in traditional neighborhood 
gangs. "Meaning, that we didn't used to shoot in an area where innocents would 
be shot," she said. "Now things are at the point where gang members say 'I'm 
going to take care of it -- if someone else gets in the way, too bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Garry Adams, also of the Santa Ana police, said that even with the outcry 
surrounding Hernandez's death, the public -- and police -- may be overwhelmed 
by helplessness: "There's a certain amount of outrage, but how do you deal with 
it when you have random shootings such as these . . . when the gangs apparently 
aren't caring about who is on the other side of the wall they are shooting at? 
These are our questions to answer first, before anything can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Jones, of the Youth and Family Center in Inglewood, has watched news 
from New York with interest -- and sees parallels between New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a disease, starting with drugs, but certainly including 
everything else -- gangs, guns, violence," she said. "We are in need of new 
healing." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, a new Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment made 
up of community action groups from all across Los Angeles, along with USC, UCLA 
and the Department of Justice, has formed to reduce violence in crime-ridden 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"People are afraid. I don't think anybody learns to live with this or accept it 
as part of life," Jones said. "There are many community programs around. But 
they become so fragmented after awhile, and far apart -- we are trying to 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
"These bullets, coming through the walls and hitting innocent people . . . 
people are really afraid of guns," Jones said. "We as a people -- and I as a 
mother -- are enraged at what's going on in our community. We are going to have 
to find a way to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"And we are going to have to do it for ourselves. In that way, we're no 
different from New York or anywhere else."
