   Two members of the rival Bloods and Crips
gangs clasped hands after three days of talks that were pronounced
a success by organizers despite the failure to produce an agreement
to stop the bloodshed.
   Gang experts and civic leaders, however, were skeptical of
whether the talks were worthwhile.
   ``They'll go back into their gangs and they'll talk with their
gang members and convince them to lay down their weapons,'' said
the Rev. Charles Mims Jr., who set up the talks between 12 gang
members in this Los Angeles suburb.
   Mims and gang members present said the talks that ended Thursday
were beneficial, despite the lack of an agreement to end the gang
fighting, which has claimed more than 165 lives in Los Angeles
County this year.
   ``We want to live, man. We don't want to die. But we don't have
nothing else to do,'' said a Bloods member who called himself
Twilight. Twilight clasped hands with a member of the Crips who
called himself Twelve.
   The Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP had withdrawn support for
the talks. And although she supported the idea of talking versus
shooting, state Sen. Diane Watson said gang members should not be
``treated like ambassadors from warring nations.''
   Mims acknowledged the gang members participating are not leaders
of gangs, although he said they hold influence with their groups.
   Police estimate gang membership in Los Angeles County at
100,000. Gang members belong to hundreds of ``sets'' that are
loosely aligned as Crips, Bloods or dozens of other smaller gangs.
