<HEADLINE>  'CRACK'S' LITTLEST VICTIMS
OAKLAND PROGRAM TARGETS CHILDREN WHO WERE
BORN INTO DRUG ADDICTION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     While still cradled in their mothers' wombs, at least two of the boys
ingested untold quantities of "crack" cocaine.;    Separated in infancy from
parents too stoned to care for them and left with lasting behavioral scars,
these young victims already have endured a lifetime of hurt from an especially
cruel drug.;    "They're very scared children," Eileen Harris, a foster
parent, says. "They don't form attachments very easily.";    But under an
Alameda County program aimed at drug-ravaged Oakland, families like the
Harrises hope to help these youngsters overcome their rocky beginnings.;   
The state-funded project, called Community Action to Reach out to Infants or
CARI, is creating a small army of specially trained foster parents in the
inner city willing to lavish extra care and attention on babies exposed to
drugs or AIDS.;    Instead of snubbing the call for help, an estimated 55
families have responded to pitches delivered at churches and neighborhood
gatherings.;    "I think the community is so affected out there. (Often)
somebody in their family is on drugs," CARI Coordinator Sheryl Walton-Rashid
says. "They're just so touched by the disease. That's what causes them to come
out and help.";    They assume no easy task.;    Crack babies are often
irritable, prone to long crying jags and difficult to feed. As they grow, they
can have delayed development and show sudden flashes of temper.;    Their
futures remain as murky as their beginnings.;    That is all the more reason
for the Harrises to take on long-term care of the trio of boys: Tazo, 2; Mark
(not his real name); and Vertis, 1.;    "They need the stability of one place
where they can feel secure," says Eileen Harris, a 44-year-old postal
supervisor.;    In the past, the three black children would probably have
wound up with white families in the suburbs, where many of the county's foster
homes are. But the CARI program strives to match drug-exposed children from
Oakland ethnically with local families.;    "The whole purpose is to go into
the city of Oakland and recruit from the neighborhoods from which these
children came," Walton-Rashid says, adding that the chances of restoring
youngsters to their families rise when the children live nearby.;    The
Harrises' days start at 7 a.m. and usually don't end until long after
midnight. Eileen Harris and her 45-year-old husband, Ron, a minister, share
the duties of feeding, changing and playing with the three unrelated
youngsters.;    "The joy is to see their eyes light up," Ron Harris says.;   
Craving attention, Tazo, who was born addicted to crack, curls up in the laps
of strangers. Mark, whose back bears a half-dollar-sized scar where he was
burned as an infant, can fly into unexpected rages. Vertis is in constant
motion.;    The Harrises are graduates of a 12-week program detailing the
laundry list of problems to expect from drug-exposed children. They are
already veteran foster parents and take their staggering routine in stride.
They see big advances in the children, whose speech and social skills are
behind many of their peers.;    "They've got a good chance," Eileen Harris
says. "By the time they reach school age, they should be on the same level."; 
  But she doubts that any of the three will ever live with their parents.
Tazo's mother finished a drug rehabilitation program but has no place to live.
Vertis' mother remains on the streets. And the Harrises hope to get permanent
guardianship of Mark, who was abused and neglected as a baby.;    Not all of
the CARI homes have such poor prospects for returning children to their
parents. Walton-Rashid estimates that 10 of about 30 CARI children went home
once their mothers completed drug programs and found suitable housing.;    One
was Angelica Reyes, 14 months, who left a foster home four months ago to live
with her 34-year-old mother, Elaine, a former heroin and cocaine addict.
Elaine Reyes also has custody of a 12-year-old son and a newborn daughter. A
2-year-old son remains in a foster home, and her 15-year-old son is with
grandparents.;    "I didn't want to lose my babies," Reyes says. She went on
methadone and undergoes twice-weekly drug testing to make sure she stays
clean. She hasn't used illicit drugs for more than a year.;    She is taking
computer classes and hopes to land an office job soon. "This is what I wanted.
I love being a parent -- that's the real me," she says.;    For every family
being put back together like the Reyeses, many more are still being ripped
apart by drug abuse.;    At least one in 10 babies delivered at the county's
Highland General Hospital shows signs of drug exposure. Drug rehabilitation
programs have long waiting lists, and the prospects for escaping poverty often
are bleak.;    But the Harrises choose not to dwell on the grim big picture,
focusing instead on nurturing their three foster children. They talk of taking
in more.;    "I've had second thoughts," Eileen admits. "When they all get to
crying, I say, 'Why am I doing this?' And then I say, 'Because no one else
will.' "  </TEXT>
