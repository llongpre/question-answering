   Two members of the British rock group Pink Floyd
arrived in Moscow Thursday en route to watch a spaceship blast off
with their latest album aboard.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Pink Floyd's Dave
Gilmour and Nick Mason would accompany President Francois Mitterrand
of France to observe the Saturday launch from the Cosmodrome at
Baikonur in Soviet Central Asia.
   The flight will be manned by a joint French-Soviet crew.
Mitterrand is expected in Moscow Friday.
   Tass said Gilmour intends to find out whether he can make a
flight aboard a Soviet space craft but that for now ``only his music
will go.''
   It said a cassette of the group's latest recording was given to
the Soyuz-7 crew and will be left aboard the orbiting space station
Mir for the enjoyment of the Soviet cosmonauts who have been living
in space.
   Pink Floyd's move into space came after the cosmonauts told a
news conference they enjoyed relaxing to the band's music.
   The group's promoters immediately sent a copy of Pink Floyd's
latest album to Moscow. It was weighed, disinfected and put in
quarantine for inclusion on the flight.
   Pink Floyd's album ``The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of the
biggest selling records ever made. The album bound for space, ``The
Delicate Sound of Thunder,'' is a recording of a Pink Floyd concert.
   Alexander Dunaev, head of the Soviet commercial space agency
Glavkosmos, had said the visit to the launch site was turned down.
He said the group was already getting enough publicity from sending
its album into space.
   But EMI Records, which handles Pink Floyd, said there was an
invitation to the launch and other preliminary events, and Gilmour
left Heathrow Airport saying: ``I was offered this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be present at a launch and I
thought I would be crazy to turn it down.''
   He added: ``I am hoping to record the launch so it may turn up on
a future Pink Floyd record.''
   Gilmour joked: ``I would go with them (the cosmonauts) if they
let me. I'd love to go. I might try to bash one of them on the head
and take his place.''
