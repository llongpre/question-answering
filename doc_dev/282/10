   Even as Venice enjoys a winter hibernation
that allows the echoes of footsteps to resound in the nearly
deserted squares, the specter of Pink Floyd refuses to go away.
   A summer concert by the British rock group that drew more than
100,000 young people and left the city awash in garbage is a
recurring nightmare.
   It is being used as ammunition in a battle over a bid to make
Venice the site of an international fair in the year 2000, and has
led officials to bar carnival celebrations from famed St. Mark's
Square.
   Pink Floyd was allowed to perform on a floating stage in the
Venice lagoon in July after the rock group agreed to reduce its
decibel level to protect the colonnaded square and 9th century
basilica.
   But the trash left behind by the concertgoers and the sight of
thousands of people sleeping in the streets proved too much for
many Venetians.
   St. Mark's, said fine arts commissioner Margherita Asso in
banning the annual carnival from the massive square, ``was attacked
by vandals and there wasn't, and still isn't, sufficient police
protection.''
   So carnival will go on in other parts of the city judged less
fragile. It will be inaugurated Feb. 10 by a procession up the
Grand Canal led by a 75-foot-long floating bottle of Italian bubbly.
   Pre-Lent merrymaking is not the only talk of Venice. There is
also the bid, put forward by the Veneto region, to make Venice and
nearby cities the site of Expo 2000.
   Backers include such powerful figures as Venetian-born Foreign
Minister Gianni De Michelis, who also supported the Pink Floyd
concert. The Socialist official, the author of a guide to discos in
Italy, had said Venice must be open to all forms of culture,
including rock music.
   The fair is seen as a way of breathing new life into this city
of canals and marble palaces, whose year-round population has
dwindled to 80,000 from 130,000 over the past 25 years. Exhibitions
would feature science and culture.
   With the proper controls, Expo 2000 would be ``the right way to
bring Venice into the new century,'' De Michelis said.
   Those in favor insist the fair could attract new businesses and
lead to the renovation of housing and neighborhoods that have
decayed as young people have gone to the mainland in search of jobs.
   They have left Venice to the summer tourists and, to the lament
of many locals, cheap souvenir shops and pizza parlors catering to
daytrippers with backpacks. Such tourism has inspired calls for
daily quotas on the number of visitors.
   ``I am one of those who believe the idea (of a fair) should be
examined, not just written off,'' said Venice's cultural
commissioner, Fulgenzio Livieri, sitting in his office looking out
onto St. Mark's Square, frequented by almost as many pigeons as
people this time of the year.
   He sees it as an opportunity to attract two industries ``ideally
suited'' to the lagoon city _ film and fashion.
   But Livieri admits the ``Pink Floyd effect'' is still running
strong.
   Graffiti and posters declaring ``No to Expo'' have gone up in
the distinctive narrow lanes near the Rialto bridge while someone
has scrawled ``De Michelis, repent'' on the causeway linking Venice
to Mestre on the mainland.
   In December, a small group of Venetians took their protest to
Paris, holding up signs outside the offices of the international
committee that will select the host city. The other candidates are
Hanover, West Germany, and Toronto, Canada.
   The committee is expected to make its decision in June.
   For a city so dependent on outsiders, even Venetians catering to
tourists seem to have had their fill and hope Venice is kept out of
the plans.
   The newsweekly Panorama reported that one study predicts a fair
would attract more than 100,000 people a day during its four-month
run, paralyze the city and strain services to the breaking point.
   ``It could be a good thing for the region but one can't have
Venice pay for it,'' said Daniela Vedaldi, owner of the Florian
cafe, whose violinists serenade honeymooners from around the world.
   ``Venice belongs to the patrimony of the whole country and of
the world. I don't think Venice needs this.''
