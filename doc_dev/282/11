A $6.5-million rock extravaganza featuring top international stars will be held 
this summer at the Berlin Wall as a "memorial for all war dead," former Pink 
Floyd band leader Roger Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a big show," the British-born rock star said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say some of the world's best-known rock performers, a cast of 300 
extras, choirs and a symphony orchestra will appear in the performance of "The 
Wall," the brainchild of Waters, who first recorded the chart-buster with Pink 
Floyd in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be the biggest rock extravaganza ever," said Jody Miller, one 
of the organizers. She said the names of the performers would only be announced 
once negotiations were completed. 
</P>
<P>
"A 600-foot-long, 60-foot-high wall will be used in the show," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get the Berlin Philharmonic or a Polish or East German orchestra. 
The Red Army Choir has confirmed that they will take part," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the head of one of the puppets in the show "will be as big as a London 
double-decker bus." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Berlin, where he is rehearsing for the July 21 
benefit show, the 46-year-old rock star said the proceeds of the performance 
will go to the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief.
