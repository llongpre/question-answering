<HEAD>Chaos as Thousands Pack Venice for Pink Floyd Concert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 50,000 people poured into the
city of canals Saturday for a free concert by the rock group Pink
Floyd, set to perform on a floating stage near St. Mark's Square.
   By early Saturday morning, 12 hours before the concert was
scheduled to begin, alleyways were packed and police were trying to
regulate the flow of people in this city of 83,000.
   The situation was exacerbated by a 24-hour transport strike that
caused chaos for inhabitants and tourists alike. An emergency
service linking up the islands, however, was in operation.
   The rail authorities issued a strong warning, telling people to
stay away from Venice with the influx of rock fans exceeding all
predictions.
   Many people spent Friday night sleeping outside the rail station
or near St Mark's Square. On Saturday the square was transformed
into a kind of sunbathing area as young people, wearing bikinis and
swimming shorts, took advantage of the sunshine while waiting for
the concert to begin.
   The concert was surrounded by controversy from the outset, with
residents and officials concerned that the loud music could damage
the city's historic buildings.
   Permission to go ahead with concert was only given Thursday after
the British group agreed to keep the volume down and organizers
agreed to move the floating stage farther from St. Mark's Square
than originally planned.
