<LEADPARA>  EARLY in the "vid revolution," music videos were expected to be among the
biggest sellers in made-for-video releases. Just how well have they lived up
to that prediction?;    Research over the past few years shows a mixed
picture. Although 40 million music videos have been rented during the last
four years, it's unusual for any single title to rent more than a million
times.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There are the blockbuster exceptions, of course. Heading the list is the
feature film "Pink Floyd The Wall," which has been rented more than 4 million
times since its 1987 debut. Michael Jackson's "Moonwalker" ranks a close
second, with 3.8 million rentals since its 1989 release.;    Pink Floyd and
Michael Jackson dominate recent single years as well. "The Wall" was the No. 1
music video rental of 1988 (2.3 million times), followed by Jackson's
"Thriller" (1.8 million); Jackson's "Moonwalker" took the top spot for 1989
among music vids, with 3 million rentals.;    The most-rented video music of
1990?;    Pre-adolescent heartthrobs New Kids on the Block, whose three
separate cassettes amounted to a total of 2 million rentals.;    Even with
these big numbers, however, all is not rosy in the music-vid biz. Although
more tapes are being released every year, total rental numbers are declining
-- from 16.7 million in 1988 to 11.9 million in '89 and 10.4 million in '90.; 
  Music barons are hardly worried, however. The drop in rentals is
counterbalanced to a degree by increased purchases. And to encourage more
retail sales, many labels are lowering prices. Analysts predict the average
cost of a music video will soon drop to below $10.;    Now that's music to our
ears!;     S-VHS GUIDE -- By the end of 1990, there were more than 300,000
laser-disc players in U.S. households and more than 3,000 titles available on
disc. But for the more than 6 million owners of super-VHS (S-VHS)
high-resolution videocassette players, it might seem as though very little has
been released in this format -- and what has been released is difficult to
find.;    If you need help, call Super Source Video in San Francisco at (800)
331-6304, and request a catalog of available S-VHS titles.;     ROLLING THE
MERCHAN-DICE -- You rented the video. You bought the sound-track CD. Now play
the video game. And buy the comic book. And . . .;    Full Moon Entertainment
is no stranger to full-spectrum merchandising. Full Moon's line of
made-for-video sci-fi and horror flicks is about to get a double boost from
its distributor, Paramount Home Video.;    First there's a media blitz for
each new title (including "Trancers II," "Puppet Master III" and a new remake
of Poe's "The Pit and the Pendulum") on television, in trade magazines and in
fan-zines like Cinefantastique. Second, there's the spin-off product line,
including sound tracks (on the Moonstone Records label); graphic-novel
adaptations of main titles, from Malibu Graphics; a fan club membership, which
includes the "Moonflash" newsletter, a T-shirt and discounts on other
merchandise such as calendars and posters and . . .;    You get the picture.
And the merchandise.;    GREETINGS! -- What's the latest in video gifts? How
about "FlikBaks," a series of tapes commemorating historic events from the
year of your birth? These 30-minute capsule-history cassettes are available
for people celebrating their 25th, 30th, 40th, 50th or 60th birthday (or
anniversary). A few other years are available as well. The tapes, produced by
L.A.'s Nadel Worldwide, sell for $14.95 and come packaged in a pop-up greeting
card. Check your local video store or gift or card shop for these
commemorative treasures.  </TEXT>
