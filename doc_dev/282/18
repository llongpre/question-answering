   West Berlin police clashed with about 500 rock
music fans who hurled bottles and cans at the stage after a concert
at the Berlin Wall, officials said Sunday.
   The violence erupted after the concert, part of a three-night
``Berlin Rock Marathon'' featuring such stars as Pink Floyd and
Michael Jackson, ended Saturday night.
   Several thousand of the estimated 35,000 concert-goers shouted
for encores, police said.
   Most fans left after being asked to do so, but about 500
remained behind, including neo-Nazis. Police said they set small
fires and threw beer bottles and cans at the stage.
   Police charged at the troublemakers, scuffling with a number of
them, authorities said. Two police officers received minor
injuries, and eight people were arrested.
   Among charges against the eight were inflicting bodily harm and
circulating Nazi pamphlets, police said.
   The rock marathon began Friday and concludes Sunday with a
performance by Jackson.
