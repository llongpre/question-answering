   About 200,000 rock music fans cheered as a
mock Berlin Wall came tumbling down midnight Saturday at a benefit
concert where the real divider once stood.
   Cyndi Lauper, Sinead O'Connor, Joni Mitchell and other stars
performed songs from Pink Floyd's 1979 rock epic ``The Wall'' on a
stage flanked by the massive plastic-foam wall meant to mimic the
dismantled Berlin Wall.
   Organizers sold 180,000 tickets but finally ordered the removal
of security fences to accommodate a huge crush of people. They
streamed onto the strip of land where trespassers during Communist
rule would have been shot instead of serenaded.
   ``There was so many people _ a lot of people without tickets _
that in the end it was safer to just put the fences down,'' said
concert spokeswoman Wendy Laister. She estimated the crowd at
200,000.
   The 6{-hour concert was billed around the world as the biggest
rock benefit ever. Proceeds were go to a fund for disaster victims.
   But thousands of fans began streaming out before the concert
reached its climax. Many complained about the poor sound system,
the difficulty most spectators had seeing the stage, and the
wind-whipped cloud of dust and dirt that hovered over the 35-acre
concert site.
   ``It wasn't good enough,'' said Corinna Treitel, 24, an American
studying in Berlin. ``I can go home and turn on the TV.''
   The carnival-like event _ held on a dust-choked expanse of land
that was once enclosed by the Berlin Wall _ began in late afternoon
and climaxed at night with a spectacular performance of Pink
Floyd's 1979 rock epic ``The Wall.''
   The concert was headlined by Roger Waters, a founder of Pink
Floyd who composed ``The Wall'' but has since left the group.
   The 600-foot-long and 60-foot high mock wall, made of 2,500
Styrofoam bricks, came crashing down at midnight at the concert's
climax.
   Many young people _ East and West Germans as well as foreigners
_ pitched tents or sat under the stars near the concert site _
Potsdamer Platz, a former main square of old Berlin that was
reduced to a desolate no-man's land when the Communists put up the
Berlin Wall in 1961.
   The wall around the plaza was torn down three months ago in
anticipation of German unification.
   When the concert began around 5:30 p.m., tens of thousands of
people were crowded onto the former ``death strip'' on the East
Berlin side of the Berlin Wall.
   ``I used to watch concerts like this on West German
television,'' said 30-year-old East German Angelika Arnold, adding
that her country's turn to democracy made the concert _ and her
attendance _ possible.
   There were many British and U.S. tourists among the sprawling
sea of relaxed fans who sat through the concert.
   Dave McCarthy said he rode 24 hours on a bus from Manchester,
England, to attend.
   ``It's pretty amazing that not too long ago they would have shot
someone who was sitting where I'm sitting,'' said the 31-year-old
banker as he sprawled on the dirt. ``But I'm not sure how many
people are into the politics. It's a pop concert.''
   Tents and stands filled the grounds, selling everything from
jewelry to Pepsi and wurst. The day was bright and hot, and
concert-goers wore shorts and T-shirts.
   Rock bands such as the Hooters and the Irish folk group the
Chieftains, accompanied by flutist James Galway, played opening
sets before the performance of ``The Wall'' began at night.
   Huge projectors showed scenes from the century's wars on the
giant plastic foam wall on stage.
   The concert also featured a six-story-high inflatible pig and an
equally large teacher, two characters in Pink Floyd's atmospheric,
other-worldly music.
   ``The Wall,'' which was made into a movie in 1982, is about
alienation and the manipulation of the minds of individuals by
authorities. It is not specifically about the Berlin Wall, though.
   The concert cost $8 million to stage and profits, as well as
those from a planned album and video, are to go to a disaster
relief fund, the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief.
   Ms. Laister said it was uncertain how much of the proceeds would
go to the disaster relief fund after expenses.
