   Fans of the rock group Pink Floyd, including
Woody Allen and Tom Cruise, more than doubled the population of this
canal city to see the band perform on a floating stage near St.
Mark's Square.
   But the square lay awash in trash Sunday after the concert the
day before, and residents were complaining about violence, drug use
and littering during the show that drew an estimated 200,000 people
to this city of 83,000.
   ``Venice has been desecrated. Excrement on the streets, filth
everywhere, violence, and drugs. Venetians can take no more of
this,'' said Augusto Salvadori, president of the Committee for the
Defense of Venice.
   But fans complained about the lack of services, saying the city
provided no special facilities such as toilets or special emergency
vehicles at the concert. A 24-hour transport strike exacerbated
problems, causing chaos for inhabitants and tourists alike. Many
concert-goers slept in the streets.
   Police said 80 people suffered minor injuries in a scuffle in the
square shortly before the concert began, when a group of fans broke
through a barrier. Scattered cases of vandalism also were reported.
   The 90-minute show, performed on a floating stage in the Venice
lagoon, included laser lights and old and new hits.
   It was broadcast live in Italy and 23 other countries, reaching a
total audience of 100 million people, according to the state-run RAI
network. It was not broadcast in the United States.
   The concert set an attendance record as Italy's largest rock
event and attracted more visitors to the historic city than did the
annual Carnival festival.
   City preservation officials had threatened to deny permission for
the concert. But on Thursday they dropped their objections when
concert organizers agreed to measures to reduce potential damage to
the surrounding buildings.
   The stage was pulled farther from the shore than previously
planned and the rock group reduced its volume to a maximum of 60
decibels instead of 105 as planned.
   Italy's vice premier, Gianni De Michelis, spoke out in favor of
the concert.
   ``Venice must give space to all cultural languages, including
that of rock music,'' he said.
