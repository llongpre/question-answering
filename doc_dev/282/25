   Country comedian Jerry Clower had a
ready solution for a Miami-based dry cleaning company that was
looking for someone in need of nearly 30 tons of unwanted clothing.
   ``I said, `Look, it's real simple. Give them to me,''' said
Clower, a native of nearby Yazoo City. ``It ain't complicated. I'll
give 5 tons to Tennessee and 5 tons to Mississippi.''
   The dry-cleaning company gave Clower 10 tons of clothes. In
December, Clower announced on The Nashville Network he was going to
give the clothes to the Salvation Army in those states. About 300
families received about 3 tons of free, dry-cleaned, used clothing
Tuesday. The giveaway was held at the Salvation Army's Camp Hidden
Lake 5 miles west of Lexington.

   While trying to placate any irked
Indianapolis natives, comedian Martin Mull turned his sights on
another city.
   Mull was quoted recently in Philip Morris magazine as saying
that baseball was superior to football because, among other
reasons, he didn't have to go to Indianapolis to watch it.
   ``Obviously what we're dealing with here is a typo,'' Mull told
The Indianapolis Star Tuesday. ``What it was supposed to say was
Annapolis. Because who in their right mind would want to go to
Annapolis?
   Mull has been to Indianapolis on numerous occasions to film
commercials for Claypool Court, a downtown shopping center owned by
Melvin Simon &amp; Associates. A Simon spokesman said the company would
await public reaction to his article before deciding whether to
employ Mull again.
   Asked if some people in Annapolis might be offended by his new
comments, Mull responded: ``Yeah, but I don't care. There are no
Claypool Courts in Annapolis.''

   LeVar Burton and Louis Gossett Jr. will
re-create their roles as Kunta Kinte and Fiddler in a TV movie,
``Roots Christmas,'' 12 years after work started on the original
``Roots'' production.
   Production started on ``Roots,'' Alex Haley's story of a black
family's journey from Africa to slavery to freedom on April 28,
1976.
   ``Roots Christmas'' dramatizes ``the inherent lust for freedom
that motivated early mass escapes of slaves, which paved the way
for the ... Underground Railroad,'' Haley said at a news conference
at Burbank Studios.
   The setting for the tale is Christmas 1770. The Underground
Railroad was a system of safe houses set up by abolitionists to
move slaves to freedom in the years before the Civil War.
   The movie also stars Michael Learned, Shaun Cassidy, Avery
Brooks, Jerry Hardin and Kate Mulgrew.

   Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason says some
scathing remarks by the group's erstwhile bassist and singer Roger
Waters revived the 20-year-old rock band and acted as a catalyst
for their current platinum album.
   ``Roger was right when he said the band was creatively dead at
the point at which he left,'' Mason said. ``It was just that when
he had gone, we thought, `Oh, why not have another crack at it. Can
we do anything about it or not?' When we started the album, we made
sure we weren't committed to anything until we had done enough work
to say, `It works _ or we think it works. Let's carry on.'''
   The result was ``A Momentary Lapse Of Reason,'' a
million-selling LP that has produced the hits ``Learning To Fly''
and ``On The Turning Away.
   Mason, 44, said a legal settlement of the group's differences
with Waters is near, but a musical reconciliation is not. Waters
left Pink Floyd to pursue a solo career because of differences in
the making of the 1983 album ``The Final Cut.''

   ``Ziegfeld,'' a lavish new musical about the
legendary Broadway showman, received poor reviews from the British
press Wednesday following its glitzy opening at the London
Palladium.
   The Daily Mail critic Jack Tinker denounced the show as ``an
eye-zonking, mind-freezing extravaganza.'' He wrote: ``As the
audience applauded each successive parade of costumes, I knew with
a sinking heart that as a musical this is what put the z in
razzamatazz and the zzzz in `Ziegfeld'.''
   ``Ziegfeld'' stars Len Cariou, the Tony-winning star of
``Sweeney Todd'' on Broadway, as Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., the
womanizing Broadway producer celebrated for his 21 ``Follies''
extravaganzas between 1907 and 1931.
   The Daily Express critic Maureen Paton said, ``The stars are so
lacking in personality that they have a great future as wine
waiters.''
   Others were equally scathing, but Irving Wardle in The Times of
London was kinder: ``The subject has two built-in advantages: a
collection of marvelous old songs and a sumptuous wardrobe.''
   ``Ziegfeld'' was directed by Broadway veteran Joe (``Barnum'')
Layton and produced by Harold Fielding, both of whom appeared
on-stage at the opening to receive a standing ovation.
