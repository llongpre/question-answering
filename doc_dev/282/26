<P>
For most of his adult life, Bill Ward had a role to play and a ready-made mask 
to wear. 
</P>
<P>
The role was prominent, and highly remunerative: drummer for Black Sabbath, one 
of the earliest, most extravagantly popular heavy metal rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
The mask was what you would expect. 
</P>
<P>
"My ego wanted you to see this heavy metal monster -- Grrrr!" Ward said, hiking 
up his shoulders under a navy blue double-breasted blazer as he imitated a 
mad-dog rocker's growl. Then he smiled a tolerant smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I know who that guy was, and I look at him sometimes," Ward said Tuesday as he 
sat in a diner on Pacific Coast Highway, not far from his home a few blocks 
from the ocean in Seal Beach. "I go, 'Yeah, he was OK. But he was pretty messed 
up.' Bill Ward the drummer seems like a distant friend these days." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ward the Black Sabbath drummer died six years ago this week in an alleyway 
in Huntington Beach. Once he had been a millionaire rock star, living in a 
fine, 19th-Century home on a hill overlooking a village in his native England. 
Drinking took all that away. Eventually, Ward's alcohol addiction stripped him 
of his ability to function as a musician. Toward the end, it estranged him from 
his friends and family. In his last days, Ward the drinker lived in the streets 
of Huntington Beach, dogged by pneumonia, looking for a way out. He found it in 
that alley, where he stuck a borrowed 12-gauge shotgun in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the courage to kill myself," Ward recalled softly. "But as a 
human being, I was already dead." 
</P>
<P>
The metal mad-dog drummer never made it out of that alley. In his place walked 
a man taking the first steps toward sobriety, and toward a new musical life in 
which the pounding headbanger drum beats still figure, but the mask is no 
longer required. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence of Ward's artistic rebirth is his first solo album, "Ward One: 
Along the Way." Released Wednesday by Chameleon Music Group, it is due in 
record stores next week. 
</P>
<P>
The album begins with the ominous crackle of an ambulance radio relaying grim 
medical reports -- a sound that Ward says became an almost routine part of his 
life in 1983 as it dwindled into a series of physical emergencies and mental 
crises fueled by his alcoholism. It ends with the sound of footsteps, first 
circumspect, but growing steadily stronger until the steps are joined by the 
sound of a light, optimistic whistle. In between, Ward's song cycle probes the 
dark, lonely tightrope walk of an addict struggling to reach for hope before he 
tumbles into despair. 
</P>
<P>
While much of "Ward One" recalls the brooding tone, wailing guitar and 
tromp-and-chug rhythms of vintage Black Sabbath, the album also has a strong 
adventurous streak that allows for an unflagging emphasis on melody, 
atmospheric textures that recall Pink Floyd, African rhythms not unlike Peter 
Gabriel's, and even the softness of a caressing rock lullaby. 
</P>
<P>
Ward sings lead vocals for the first time in his 22-year rock career, in a 
voice that is limited, but evocative after the manner of Roger Waters' dramatic 
singing in Pink Floyd (minus the screams). Ward gets some all-star help from 
Ozzy Osbourne, his old Black Sabbath band mate, and from Cream alumnus Jack 
Bruce, each of whom sings the lead on two songs. 
</P>
<P>
As a founding member of Black Sabbath, Ward had some creative input, but he 
faced nothing like the wide-ranging demands of writing, singing and arranging 
an album of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I put in what I could, how I could," he said of his creative role in 
Black Sabbath, which Ward formed in 1968 along with Osbourne, bassist Terry 
(Geezer) Butler and guitarist Tony Iommi. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to writing songs with Black Sabbath, "I'd let things pass. I'd 
have an idea, and I'd keep it inside. Finding out what I'm capable of, what's 
inside -- that's what this album is about. There's been a whole discovery. I 
found a guy who had this inside him, but didn't know how to let it out." 
</P>
<P>
For Ward, 41, the process of finding a musical self began after he gained 
sobriety in 1984. First, he rejoined Butler and Iommi in Black Sabbath, but he 
soon quit the band, feeling that it had stagnated (Iommi still leads a rump 
version of Black Sabbath). Ward tried playing with other musicians for two 
years but failed to find a focus. 
</P>
<P>
Then, starting in 1987, he began work on "Ward One" with a nucleus of Southern 
California-based musicians, including guitarists Rue Phillips and Keith Lynch, 
who helped Ward write the music on several of the album's songs. 
</P>
<P>
Ward contacted Bruce and asked him to sing two songs, even though he had never 
met the former Cream singer-bassist. Bruce's clear, emotive tenor serves as the 
voice of comfort and encouragement on the lullaby, "Light Up the Candles," and 
on "Tall Stories," an affirmative rocker in which Ward writes of regaining the 
ability to play music. 
</P>
<P>
"Ozzy invited himself," Ward said. "He said, 'What's all this I hear about you 
doing an album? You haven't invited me.' " Ward turned the microphone over to 
Osbourne for the album's most Sabbath-like rockers, "Jack's Land" and the 
excellent "Bombers (Can Open Bomb Bays)." 
</P>
<P>
Osbourne, whose own successful solo career has been played out against 
continuing struggles with drug and alcohol abuse, is the voice of baleful 
warning in his two songs, expressing bleak visions of addiction's consequences, 
yet also pointing to hope and recovery as open paths. 
</P>
<P>
At least at the start, the guest stars and Sabbath connections will be a big 
part of the promotional strategy for Ward's album, according to Stephen Powers, 
president of Chameleon, the Hawthorne-based independent record label that has 
raised its profile with recent releases by Mary's Danish and John Lee Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get out of the gate based on past history and associations," 
Powers said. "But our long-range goal is to develop Bill as an artist so they 
don't see this as a one-off where his friends came in and played and that's the 
only reason for the album." 
</P>
<P>
Ward wants no part of the metal-monster baggage that came with Black Sabbath, a 
band infamous for its dark musings, occult trappings and demonic imagery. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do death any more. I don't want to do doom and gloom. I want 
to do life and love," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want no burning skulls or demonic interest," he added, speaking of video 
plans. "Naked women running across the video set -- no thank you. Get somebody 
else to do that. I've had enough of that. If I get the opportunity to do any 
videos and you see any skulls in it, you can come over to my house and smack my 
head with a big shovel." 
</P>
<P>
Doom-laden imagery aside, Ward said he is still fond of Black Sabbath's 
head-banging sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I love its primitivism, its naivete," he said. "A very important rock band and 
a very good band. I love 'em. I can be a fan now. I can listen to it and be 
outside it." 
</P>
<P>
Ward acknowledges that he remains a fortunate Sabbath insider in one respect: 
royalties. "It's been a godsend. I get to feed the kids," he said of catalogue 
sales spurred by the advent of compact discs. "I'm hoping I can get in a 
position where I'm self-supporting from my own work." 
</P>
<P>
As his first album emerges, Ward is preparing for one of the last but most 
difficult steps along the way to a full comeback: touring. In the early '80s, 
an alcohol-fogged Ward was capable of suffering a nervous breakdown at the mere 
thought of touring. The drummer said he is putting together a band and road 
crew for a "noncommittal" round of live shows this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I could still have mixed feelings" about touring, said Ward, a father of three 
who lives with his third wife and his two younger children in a quiet section 
of quaint Seal Beach, an old Navy town that couldn't be farther from the rock 
'n' roll fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I want to go a little slow. I'm looking for a place inside where I 
can say, 'Yeah, I feel OK about this.' I want to make the professional 
commitment. I want to work through the fears that I have about going on the 
road. That's my goal. If that trial run works, we'll get more committed." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Ward won't feel compelled to wear that old heavy metal monster's 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
"(With Black Sabbath) I felt I had to perform for everybody the way I thought 
they wanted me to be, instead of playing what I am. I feel I've begun to play 
what I am instead of playing safe. I'm letting myself be vulnerable nowadays. 
I'm being more of a human being these days."
