An Italian lawmaker in Rome demanded a ban Thursday on concerts such as the one 
last weekend in Venice by British rock band Pink Floyd that smothered the city 
in rubbish and damaged its monuments. The demand was made as the Venice City 
Council, stung by calls for its resignation over Saturday's concert, was 
studying a proposal to limit the number of tourists allowed to enter the lagoon 
city each day. Sen. Piergiorgio Gradari of the neo-fascist MSI party made a 
formal request to the Interior Ministry to ban events that could threaten 
public order or could damage any city's artistic heritage. Senators from the 
Greens environmentalist party asked the Rome government to put a value on the 
damage done to Venice during the concert. Venice's mayor and City Council have 
come under fire for allowing the free concert to be held without providing 
sufficient sleeping, eating or toilet facilities for the more than 150,000 fans 
who poured into the city. The fans, who included film director Woody Allen and 
actress Mia Farrow, crammed waterfronts and clambered onto monuments and roofs 
of churches to watch the concert, staged on a floating platform off St. Mark's 
Square. ALEENE MacMINN
