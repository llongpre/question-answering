   The Rolling Stones opened their first concert
tour in eight years with fireworks and Mick Jagger's trademark strut
as 50,000 fans jumped to their feet and began a night of dancing at
their seats.
   The Stones, launching their 29-city ``Steel Wheels'' tour with
concerts at Veterans Stadium Thursday and Friday, played on a stage
110 feet high and 300 feet wide showing a scene of industrial decay
with catwalks, gray girders and black nets.
   ``Strong, tough, urban, risky,'' is how set-designer Michael
Fisher, who previously designed the stage for Pink Floyd's ``The
Wall'' tour, described the set, which includes more than 100 lights
and three video screens.
   The Stones opened with ``Start Me Up'' from 1981, followed with
``Bitch'' from 1971 and ``Shattered'' from 1978. They then left the
stage briefly, explaining they had lost power.
   After they returned, they were joined by three backup singers and
four horn players.
   The flamboyant Jagger strutted around the stage singing in his
raunchy style while wearing his black leather pants and a kelly
green tuxedo jacket.
   The crowd, which saw the band Living Colour as the opening act,
ranged from young to old _ some even as old as the Stones themselves.
   ``They transcend age groups,'' said Tom Scespie, 45, of Scranton.
``I think they're one of the super-bands still left.''
   ``They seem to change with the times or stay ahead of the
times,'' said Rebecca Stinnler, a 25-year-old resident of nearby
Doylestown. She called the band ``the greatest in the world.''
   The stage was unveiled just hours before Thursday night's opening
show of the tour. About 250 people are needed to handle all of the
equipment. Michael Ahearn, production manager, called the stage a
``stirring indictment of contemporary society.''
   Concertgoers paid $28.50 apiece for tickets, which sold out in
two hours, 45 minutes. Scalpers were getting as much as $200 a
ticket.
   The group opened its last tour, in 1981, in Philadelphia as well.
   The ``Steel Wheels'' album has received generally favorable
reviews. Some critics have called it the group's best work since
1978's ``Some Girls.''
   Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood, bassist Bill
Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts recorded the group's 34th album in
Barbados earlier this year after Jagger and Richards, the leaders of
British band, resolved their feud over Jagger's desire to record and
tour separately.
   The next stops on the 29-city North American tour are Sept. 3-4
in Toronto, and Sept. 6 in Pittsburgh.
   Buffalo, N.Y., was supposed to have the opening of the tour on
Friday night but lost out to Philadelphia after Mayor W. Wilson
Goode ordered the closing of the aging John F. Kennedy Stadium,
where the Stones were scheduled to play Sept. 21, for safety
reasons. This was the only week the Stones could get Veterans
Stadium.
   This year marks the 25th anniversary of the group's first
recording, and some have speculated that ``Steel Wheels'' may be the
Stones' last tour.
