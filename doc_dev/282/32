   Roy Acuff, the 85-year-old ``king of
country music,'' would like to continue performing despite an
earlier announcement that he's considering retiring, the general
manager of the Grand Ole Opry says.
   Acuff, best known for ``The Wabash Cannonball,'' was honored
earlier this week with a special humanitarian award at The
Nashville Networks' Viewers' Choice Awards.
   ``I seem to be a burden on other people,'' the fiddler-singer
said after receiving the award. ``I have to be helped through the
crowd like a baby. I have to be treated like a baby.''
   But Hal Durham, Opry general manager, said Acuff has told him he
wants to remain on stage where he has performed for presidents and
plumbers alike.
   ``The only health problem I'm aware of is his loss of vision,''
Durham said. ``But he still sees, and he wants to work all the
shows this year.''
   ``He has to depend on someone to help him, and to a person who's
been so active, that's a tough adjustment,'' Durham said.
   Acuff has entertained on the Opry's radio show for 51 years. For
more than 20 years, he made overseas trips to entertain U.S. armed
forces at Christmas.

   Singer Lena Horne says she'd like to get married
again, but doubts she can find a good match.
   ``The women's movement came a little late in my life,'' Ms.
Horne, 71, says in the Sunday issue of Parade magazine.
   ``I find many women who don't have the need I do. They want to
be independent, see somebody when they feel like it, maybe _ but
otherwise, a man is not convenient in their lives.
   ``I envy that, but I would like to be married,'' said Ms. Horne,
whose husband, bandleader-arranger Lennie Hayton, died in 1971
after 24 years of marriage.
   Still, ``I doubt whether I could make a successful marriage now.
I've worked out the way I am,'' she added. ``Unless _ unless the
man was absolutely unique, one who could match my experiences.
Maybe ... if he was a man who has had as many metamorphoses in his
life as I've had.''
   Ms. Horne, who has released a new album titled ``The Men in My
Life,'' lamented that people think ``women in their 70's have no
desire to be desired.''

   The British rock group Pink Floyd will play five
concerts in June at Moscow's Olympic stadium.
   The band said the Soviet government made the performances
possible by offering to fly in the group's more than 300 tons of
stage equipment.
   Dozens of lasers, computerized lighting systems, circular
screens, videos, fireworks, smoke effects and a model of a flying
pig, one of the band's trademarks, will be used in the show.
   ``We have always had a reputation for not cutting corners,
trying to put on the best show possible, sparing no expense and
producing some surprises,'' said guitarist Dave Gilmour.
   Soviet officials asked the band to play Moscow when Gilmour and
fellow band member Nick Mason traveled to the capital last November
to watch the Salyut 7 spaceship blast off with their album aboard.
``The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of the biggest-selling records
ever made.

   Gil Shaham, a young violinist summoned from school
in New York City to replace veteran Itzhak Perlman at two London
concerts, won plaudits from the audience and flowers from the
orchestra.
   ``This is something I've never had before,'' Shaham said in his
dressing room at the Royal Festival Hall after Thursday's
performance.
   The audience had called him back four times and cheered him
after his performance of the difficult Violin Concerto No. 1 by Max
Bruch.
   Shaham, 18, was reciting the prologue from Geoffrey Chaucer's
``The Canterbury Tales'' in an English examination on Tuesday when
he was called out and asked to fly to London the next day for two
concerts because Perlman, the Israeli virtuoso, was ill with an ear
infection.
   Shaham promptly took three days off school.
   ``I was nervous because I felt I could not fill in for
Perlman,'' Shaham said. ``I last played the Bruch in December and
the Sibelius in the summer.''
   ``But the funny thing is,'' he added, ``I had some bizarre
premonition about this. On Monday I changed the strings on my
Guadagnini (violin), which I always do before a concert, although I
wasn't booked for any concert this week.''

   Prince Charles says Romania's President Nicolae
Ceausescu is destroying that country's cultural heritage by razing
villages and replacing city buildings with ``a uniform and deathly
mock modernity.''
   In an unusual royal criticism of a foreign leader, the
40-year-old heir to the British throne said he was appalled at
``the awful specter of an entire society _ not just certain
districts _ losing its roots and its ancient communities.''
   ``The 20th century has witnessed some strange aberrations of the
human spirit but few can match the activities of rulers who boast
about their patriotism and then systematically undertake the
destruction of the cultural heritage of their people,'' Charles
said at an architecture exhibition on Wednesday.
   ``President Ceausescu has set about destroying the cities and
villages of his country and replacing them with blocks of flats
(apartments) which are a repetition of failed 1960s social
engineering mixed with the atmosphere of George Orwell's `1984,'''
he added.
   Ceausescu plans to demolish thousands of villages, as well as
historic churches and old cemeteries, to create an ideal communist
state of industrial centers and gain more farmland for use by
state-owned collective farms.
