Restaging "The Wall" with a cast of zillions last July in an undivided Berlin 
was a grand gesture, but need we bother with another recording of the 1979 
magnum opus Waters originally conceived for Pink Floyd? 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the answer is yes.

The recording is a logistical achievement that seamlessly blends orchestra, 
choir, Waters' extremely effective rock band and a succession of guest singers 
and soloists. While Cyndi Lauper misfires on "Another Brick in the Wall" and 
Sinead O'Connor underplays her role on "Mother," many of the guest turns are 
exceptional: a shockingly husky-voiced but haunting Joni Mitchell, aggressive 
grit from Bryan Adams, Paul Carrack's graceful R&amp;B classicism and, above 
all, Van Morrison's impassioned "Comfortably Numb."

Though repetitive, and short on pop aria compared to such standard-setting 
programmatic rock works as "Arthur," "Tommy" or "Quadrophenia," "The Wall" 
remains involving and gains thematic resonance from this performance's locus 
(the Nazi fantasy sequence played in the heart of Berlin!). All in all, this 
Berlin "Wall" stands up well to the test of any live album: Hearing it, you 
wish you'd been there. MIKE BOEHM
