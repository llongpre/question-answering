   Historic St. Mark's Square was awash in
trash and many Venetians were miffed after rock fans more than
doubled the canal city's population for a performance by the group
Pink Floyd.
   ``Venice has been desecrated: excrement on the streets, filth
everywhere, violence, and drugs. Venetians can take no more of
this,'' said Augusto Salvadori, president of the Committee for the
Defense of Venice.
   Saturday's show on a floating stage near St. Mark's drew an
estimated 200,000 people to this city of 83,000, among them
actor-director Woody Allen and movie star Tom Cruise.
   On Sunday, the square was a sea of trash.
   Fans at the concert had complained of lack of services, saying
the city provided no toilets or emergency vehicles. A 24-hour
transport strike exacerbated problems, causing chaos for inhabitants
and tourists alike. Many concert-goers slept in the streets.
   Police said 80 people suffered minor injuries in a scuffle in the
square shortly before the concert began, when a group of fans broke
through a barrier. Scattered cases of vandalism also were reported.
   The 90-minute show with laser lights was broadcast live in Italy
and 23 other countries, reaching a total audience of 100 million
people, according to the state-run RAI network. It was not broadcast
in the United States.
   The concert set an attendance record as Italy's largest rock
event and attracted more visitors to Venice than does the annual
Carnival festival.
   City preservation officials had threatened to deny permission for
the concert. But on Thursday, they dropped their objections when
concert organizers agreed to pull the stage farther from shore and
reduce volume to a maximum of 60 decibels instead of 105.
   Italy's vice premier, Gianni De Michelis, spoke out in favor of
the concert.
   ``Venice must give space to all cultural languages, including
that of rock music,'' he said.
