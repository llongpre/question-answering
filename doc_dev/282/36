   A loud rock concert by Pink Floyd
violated a city noise ordinance, but officials said they couldn't
find anybody band members to give citations when the music ended.
   ``During the grand finale with all the fireworks, they were
leaving the stadium to beat the crowds,'' Art Seipel, Sacramento
County environmental health specialist, said Thursday.
   Noise from the event reached 111 decibels, about the same level
as a jet airliner taking off 200 feet away, Seipel said.
   The show's promoter, Bill Graham Presents, and Sacramento City
College were given citations for the noise of the Wednesday night
concert, which attracted 27,000 to the college's Hughes Stadium.
   Noise violations are misdemeanors with maximum penalties of a
$500 fine and a year in jail.
