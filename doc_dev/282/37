<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ONE of the great, unsung groups in the history of non-classical music was the
English ensemble the Soft Machine. "Non-classical" is the only way to put it,
because when it came to this group, terms like rock, pop and jazz had no
meaning. Or, rather, new meaning.;   The group was formed in 1966 and became
part of the burgeoning experimental scene in London that also produced Pink
Floyd. But while the Floyd went on to pursue -- and flourish in -- a pop
course, the Softs opted for an avant-garde sound that was a hit in Europe but
never gained a foothold here. (Soft Machine did open for Jimi Hendrix on his
debut tour of the United States in 1968, but that was the apex of the band's
visibility on this side of the Atlantic.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Softs' sound was a dense amalgam of dissonance, electronics and
distortion that blurred the boundaries between pop, jazz, rock and modern
classical music. Keyboardist Mike Ratledge produced abstract, angular phrases
and chords that had few musical precedents. Bassist Kevin Ayres provided
complex and delicate theme lines on bass. And drummer and lead vocalist Robert
Wyatt virtually invented a new form of pop-based vocals that had as much to do
with Schonberg's "Pierrot Lunaire" as they did with the rock of the day.;  
Combined, these founding members -- the group would evolve over the years with
new lineups -- created a sound that begat the rise of jazz-rock (before Miles
Davis began his work in the form). In the process, the Soft Machine became one
of the few intriguing rock groups of the dismal '70s.;   Recently, the group
has received new attention on record and in print. "The Peel Sessions" (Dutch
East India Strange Fruit Records, DE 18501-2) captures the group (with its
second bassist Hugh Hopper) in a series of live recordings made for a British
radio program in 1969, '70 and '71. "As If" (Elite, 006CD) is a provocative
set of the group's later jazz-infused work of the '70s. And in the September
issue of The Wire magazine, there is an interview with the wry, witty and
iconoclastic Wyatt, who has one of the most fertile musical intellects of this
or any other time.;   CLASSICAL McCARTNEY -- In his "Sgt. Pepper" days, Paul
McCartney was quoted saying rock was the classical music of its time. But this
year, he made an about-face, composing his first classical piece, "Liverpool
Oratorio," in a collaboration with the British classical and soundtrack
composer Carl Davis. That piece made its debut in a performance at the
Liverpool Cathedral on June 28. A tape of that performance will be aired Oct.
30 at 9 p.m. on KQED (Ch. 9) as part of the "Great Performances" series.;  
CLASSIC FATS -- One of McCartney's idols, a classic in his own right, was Fats
Domino. Fats made his debut in 1949 with the hit "The Fat Man" and went on to
set the table for rock 'n' roll with such hits as "Blueberry Hill," "Ain't
That A Shame" and others. In his remarkable career he has sold more than 65
million records. Now Fats is the star of a four-CD boxed set: "They Call Me
The Fat Man . . . Antoine 'Fats' Domino, The Legendary Imperial Recordings."
The set comes with 100 of Domino's songs, some released in stereo for the
first time. There also is a booklet of liner notes, historical photos and a
discography. It goes on sale Oct. 22.;   ON WITH THE SHOWS -- Morrissey is
back! The former vocalist of the Smiths performs at 8 p.m. Oct. 31 (Halloween
night) at Shoreline Amphitheatre. Tickets for his show go on sale Sunday at
$20.50 (reserved) and $18.50 (general). Morrissey's June 8 show at the Greek
Theatre at the University of California, Berkeley sold out to the tune of a
whopping 12,000 tickets in an hour and a half. His U.S. tour has been a
surprise smash in this summer of pop flops.;   The '70s heyday of jazz-rock is
gone but one of its virtuosos, violinist Jean Luc Ponty, is still at it. He
comes to the area for a show at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland at 8 p.m.
Oct. 30. Tickets go on sale Sunday at $20.50. Call (408) 998-2277 or (510)
762-2277.  </TEXT>
