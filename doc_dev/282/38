   The Rolling Stones proved they've still got
hot stuff as they rocked a crowd of 50,000 to kick off their first
tour in eight years.
   ``They're better than ever,'' Joy Harrington, 43, of
Philadelphia, said following Thursday's sold-out show that lasted
more than 2{ hours.
   The Stones are ``the best partying band,'' said Anne Reissig, 51,
from New York's Long Island.
   They were among the crowd that packed Veterans Stadium to see the
Stones launch their 36-city ``Steel Wheels'' tour with fireworks and
Mick Jagger's trademark strut. The group opened its last tour in
Philadelphia in 1981.
   ``We've started in Philadelphia two times in a row,'' Jagger told
crowd. ``I hope it's not too tough on you.''
   ``I think they're better this show,'' said Randy Coppola, 27, of
Medford, N.J., who also saw the British band in 1981. ``I think Mick
Jagger was in top form.''
   The Stones took the stage about 9:30 p.m. with the 1981 hit
``Start Me Up'' and immediately had the crowd dancing. They followed
with ``Bitch'' from 1971 and ``Shattered'' from 1978.
   They then left the stage briefly, explaining they had lost power.
   Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood, bassist Bill
Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts were joined on stage by three
backup singers, two keyboard players and five horn players.
   Shortly after midnight, they finished their only encore with
``Jumping Jack Flash,'' which was followed briefly by fireworks.
   ``The Stones not only have it, they have it better than most
bands in the last 10 years,'' said Mark Moatz, 29, of Philadelphia.
``I enjoyed it immensely.''
   Todd Harrington, 23, Mrs. Harrington's son, said the band was
``just as good'' as ever and now were ``more mature, better
dressed.''
   Jagger paraded around the stage singing in his raunchy style and
wearing black pants and a kelly green tuxedo jacket. Later, he wore
a red jacket.
   The Stones performed on a stage that measured 110 feet high and
300 feet wide and showed a scene of industrial decay with catwalks,
gray girders and black nets. ``Strong, tough, urban, risky,'' is how
set designer Michael Fisher, who previously designed the stage for
Pink Floyd's ``The Wall'' tour, described it.
   During ``Honky Tonk Woman,'' two balloon figures of scantily clad
women, nearly as tall as the stage, were inflated.
   The crowd, which saw the band Living Colour open about 7:45 p.m.
with a 45-minute set, ranged from those not yet born when the Stones
first began recording 25 years ago to those as old as the band's
members.
   ``They transcend age groups,'' said Tom Espie, 45, of Scranton.
``I think they're one of the super bands still left.''
   ``They seem to change with the times or stay ahead of the
times,'' said Rebecca Stinnler, a 25-year-old Doylestown resident
who called the band ``the greatest in the world.''
   ``It's just good music. I think anybody would like it,'' said Amy
LaRue, 20, of Reading.
   June Kroop, 41, of Passaic, N.J., said she saw the Stones live
when she was 19.
   ``I never was a hysterical fan for anybody. I just like rock 'n'
roll. It's the adventure, the lure,'' she said.
   Another show is scheduled for Veterans Stadium tonight before the
band goes to Toronto on Sunday.
