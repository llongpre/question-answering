A phase is ending for Metallica, and it will be interesting to see where the 
most ferocious of heavy-metal bands will turn next. 
</P>
<P>
After well over a year on the road, the future probably was the last thing the 
Northern California band had in mind Thursday night at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. Before a capacity crowd of 15,000 who slammed fists, heads and 
bodies to its rumbling slab of sound, Metallica began a three-night stand 
(ending tonight) that concludes its U.S. tour behind the double-platinum album 
". . . And Justice for All." (There are, though, a few more dates in South 
America before the group gets to rest.) 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Metallica gave itself more than two hours to review territory 
covered thus far. 
</P>
<P>
There was speed metal -- an '80s sub-genre that Metallica pretty much defined 
-- all frenetic chugging, meet-at-the-final-angry-chord-and-melody-be-damned. 
There were slower, lumbering head-banger beats, familiar to heavy-rock fans 
since Black Sabbath's early days, but seldom delivered with more glowering 
intensity. And, in the departure that makes Metallica's future worth pondering, 
there were sculpted, episodic pieces in which the band explores guitar lyricism 
between blasts of its accustomed headlong fury. 
</P>
<P>
Fury and revulsion are the basis for virtually all of Metallica's music. The 
show began with "Blackened," a grim portrayal of nuclear holocaust. Taking off 
from this opening overview of the Earth's fate, James Hetfield, Metallica's 
singer-lyricist, spent the rest of the concert roaring about such subsidiary 
evils as conventional war, insanity, suicide and drug addiction. Metallica 
capped its show -- as it has for this entire tour -- by exploding a massive 
statue of Blind Justice that, in a less elaborate echo of Pink Floyd's staging 
of "The Wall," had been built bit by bit while the band played on a set that 
looked like a courthouse ruin. 
</P>
<P>
The seriousness and passion with which Metallica attacks its dark themes is 
unusual for heavy metal, and that seriousness sets a welcome example for bands 
and fans who want to move beyond the typical metal subjects of sexual swagger, 
dumb fun and sword-and-sorcery fantasy escape. But Metallica still is prone to 
one common metal malady: a tendency to inflate ideas to an epic scale while 
cloaking them in dramatic abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Metallica's future can bring a more personal approach to songwriting, 
not to mention an exploration of some less dire subjects. The band did show it 
could create a lighter mood during an offhanded encore that included one or two 
metal-boogie numbers played in a garage-rock style that was loose but still 
emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
Another question for the future is how far Metallica is willing to go toward 
balancing brute force with lyricism. While the band's hammering power is surely 
at the core of its success, the show's most affecting moments came when the din 
subsided for stately harmony guitar parts that achieved a lovely grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
"Fade to Black," the meditation on suicide, ended with a memorable passage in 
which lead guitarist Kirk Hammett combined force and melody to fine emotional 
effect. It conveyed deep sorrow without reining in the band's hard-rock thrust. 
During his otherwise unremarkable solo guitar spot, Hammett paid homage to Jimi 
Hendrix's "Little Wing," the zenith of rock guitar lyricism. Not a bad 
direction to keep pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
Also open to question, of course, is whether Metallica's audience would be 
willing to follow if the band decided to move further from a pure speed-metal 
base and closer to the more lyrical hard-rock tradition of Hendrix and the Who. 
But on this night, the point was to enjoy the band-audience bond as it exists 
now, in a show that recapitulated Metallica's past with authority. 
</P>
<P>
If Metallica doesn't leap into the metal future, Faith No More may get there 
first. The Bay Area band's opening set was a boundary-breaking amalgam of 
progressive-rock keyboards, rap-soul vocals, thrash-metal rhythms and wailing 
heavy guitar -- all held together with accomplished playing. Singer Mike Patton 
spent too much time fretting aloud about the less than rapturous reception the 
band was getting. He ought to relax: An adventurous approach always takes some 
time to sink in.
