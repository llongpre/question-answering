</DATELINE>

<P>
The Wall is back in Berlin -- not the concrete barrier that divided the city 
for 28 years but the rock extravaganza by Pink Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of musicians, actors and even Soviet and British soldiers will perform 
"The Wall" on Saturday at a bizarre venue -- the former death strip where 
border guards once had orders to open fire on East Germans trying to flee to 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaimed rock opera by Pink Floyd's former leader, Roger Waters, will be 
performed on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's ever thought about doing a concert between two countries in a 
prohibited military zone, as this area still was when we started planning," 
producer Mick Worwood said. "We've created a city here." 
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people will attend the $8-million concert featuring a 
symphony orchestra, Soviet and British military helicopters, a Soviet army 
marching band, Hells Angels motorcycle riders, Waters' new group The Bleeding 
Hearts and a clutch of guest musicians including folk-rock singers Joni 
Mitchell and Van Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-foot-high stage near the Brandenburg Gate has dominated Berlin's 
skyline for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Few traces remain at the site of the Berlin Wall, opened last November and 
since mostly demolished. But the set includes a wall of its own, made from 
2,000 white polystyrene blocks, as a backdrop to the tale of rebellion against 
authority and alienation told by the music. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's concert is the most elaborate of several events planned this summer 
to celebrate the end of the Cold War division of Berlin.
