   Music videos have become one of the sharpest
promotional tools for records since radio play, but their
usefulness may be waning.
   Not all artists need, or want, their MTV, and record company
executives concede that after years of trying, they simply cannot
make money selling video clips to consumers.
   While costs have increased, outlets for showing music videos
have diminished from several syndicated shows to just two
continuous programming cable channels and six major cable shows
lasting from 14 hours a day to one hour a week.
   Still, such stars as Tiffany, Terence Trent D'Arby and George
Michael owe their success to the image they present through slick
video productions that cost anywhere from $10,000 to $225,000 to
produce.
   ``When videos first started, it was an emotional point for
everyone to ask for one, and it made sense,'' said Jeff Gold, vice
president of creative services for A&amp;M Records. ``I can remember
five years ago that $100,000 was an unthinkable amount, and now
$100,000 is a regular cost for a major production.''
   ``Three years ago, I said there was no market for music videos
in retail stores. That holds true today. We don't even stock it _
it just isn't worth it to us,'' said Allan Caplan of Omaha-based
Applause Video, with 85 retail outlets.
   Caplan said only so-called ``longform'' videos, usually concert
documentaries or rock music movies such as Pink Floyd's ``The
Wall,'' do reasonably well. But those aren't really classified as
videos.
   Record companies, who finance artists' video production, tend to
view music videos as strictly a promotional vehicle, according to
Jack Rovner, a marketing vice president for CBS Records. The
companies usually make the initial outlay for the production then
seek repayment tied to the success of the record the video is
promoting.
   ``But 85 percent of our records fail to break even, and in that
case we shoulder the entire cost,'' Gold said.
   There is some recovery for record companies through fees charged
for exclusive use of videos on broadcast outlets, but that hardly
dents the production cost.
   ``What has changed in the past five years is the amount of
scrutiny about why we are doing a video: What is it going to yield
for the artist? Can we get a placement (air time) for the video?
And will we realize our goals and the artist's goals,'' Rovner said.
   A new standard practice for newly signed artists at CBS and
other major labels is a screen test. An artist's first step to
getting a video may be his or her last.
   But even visually exciting acts have decided a video may not be
the way to the top of the charts.
   ``It's always been our feeling that you should come see the band
live, because there's no way to translate the energy and the
excitement of what goes on stage and try to put it inside a box the
size of a TV set,'' said Alex Van Halen, drummer of the rock group
Van Halen.
   For its ``5150'' album, Van Halen released no promotional
videos, but later made a concert-length film from which video
programs edited some clips. Similarly, the band has decided to
promote its ``OU812'' album with a concert. Both albums reached the
top of the charts without a video.
   ``Sometimes we will kick back and spend the (promotional) money
putting a band on the road,'' said A&amp;M's Gold. ``You can put a band
out on the road for a long time for what it costs to do a video,
and in some cases, the money is better spent.''
   Music videos rose to prominence in the early 1980s, but short
promotional clips and segments from filmed concerts or shows have
been popular since the '50s.
   No one denies that videos played in heavy rotation on Music
Television (MTV), Video Hits One (VH-1) or Black Entertainment
Television (BET), can mean big sales and instant recognition.
   ``Music video is as powerful, if not more so, than it has ever
been,'' MTV senior vice president Lee Masters said.
   He noted, for example, that in the week of June 27, MTV had
broken 10 acts of the Top 40 listings.
   ``In spite of the fact that MTV will be adding more non-music
programming, we have never had this many acts represented in the
Top 40,'' he said.
   Like other music video outlets, MTV has matured in its seven
years, with 17 out of 168 weekly hours now devoted to non-video
programs. The video rotation has dropped from 120 to 80 clips, and
audience analysis has begun to determine what videos are presented,
and when.
   One such change was the scheduling of ``Club MTV,'' a mix of new
music videos and dance videos appreciated by younger teen-agers,
for 3:30 p.m. when school generally lets out.
   Outlets have refused to show some videos whose content they
consider controversial, such as drug use, explicit sexuality or
nudity. Record companies also have to take into account that videos
are presented in European markets on regular television, sometimes
on children's shows.
   ``You can't have anyone smoking _ nothing risque. There's a
whole list of things,'' said A&amp;M's Gold.
