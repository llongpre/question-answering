<TEXT>     2. Or one movie (other than "The Wall" or a concert film) that contained
three songs by Pink Floyd as well as one by the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia
and the Youngbloods?;    3. Or one movie in which a Roy Orbison song appeared
years before "Blue Velvet" and one in which an Orbison song appeared after
"Blue Velvet"?;    The answers -- and the records in question -- are contained
in "Rock Goes to the Movies," a series of albums that has been released by CBS
Special Products.;    The answers:;    1. "Easy Rider" (which contained
"Wasn't Born to Follow" and "The Ballad of Easy Rider"), "Candy" ("Child of
the Universe") and "Don't Make Waves" (the title song).;    2. "Zabriskie
Point," a 1970 film by director Michelangelo Antonioni, who had earlier used
the Yardbirds' "Stroll On" for a scene in "Blow-Up.";    3. "Zigzag" (the
title song) and "Pretty Woman" (Orbison's classic "Oh, Pretty Woman").;   
Rock 'n' roll and movies go all the way to "The Blackboard Jungle," a 1955
film about a tough urban high school.;    The film -- which featured Bill
Haley's "Rock Around the Clock" over the opening credits -- had an enormous
effect on teen-agers because rock concerts were rare. Most teens had only been
able to listen to the raw new sound on tiny radio or record-player speakers.; 
  In the theaters, they suddenly heard "Rock Around the Clock" exploding
through huge speakers -- and they were hearing it with hundreds of other
teen-agers, providing what was, in effect, their first rock-concert
experience. It didn't matter that the band wasn't there. The music boomed and
"Rock Around the Clock" went right to No. 1.;    Bruce Eder, who selected the
material for the series, traces the history of rock 'n' movies in the liner
notes to the albums, including some information about some of the rarities
featured on the albums.;    The five individual volumes are short by CD
standards (just 31 to 43 minutes) and contain few of the classic rock-film
selections (no Elvis Presley, Beatles or Prince material, for instance), so
the series is far from definitive.;    But you may find a few lost favorites
among the 57 selections -- mostly taken from the MGM-UA or CBS Records
catalogs. Among the other artists featured: the Lovin' Spoonful (songs from
"What's Up, Tiger Lily?" and "You're a Big Boy Now"), Johnny Horton ("Sink the
Bismarck!"), Neil Young ("The Strawberry Statement"), Ray Charles ("The
Cincinnati Kid"), Mountain ("Vanishing Point") and Flatt &amp; Scruggs ("Bonnie
and Clyde").  </TEXT>
