Businesses usually have 30 to 60 days to settle bills and consumers pay cash
for many goods and services. But sport and music fans are being expected to
pay for tickets up to 2 1/2 years in advance.
Tickets for the 1996 European soccer championship, to be played in England,
went on general sale last week - 20 months before the first game kicks off.
But season ticket-holders at English league clubs were offered priority
booking last January - nearly 2 1/2 years before Euro '96 begins.
Mike Parry, of the Football Association, says early ticket sales are 'to
give real fans ample opportunity to buy them. It's a huge operation,
involving 1.3m tickets at eight venues. The time is needed to ensure the
smooth running of the competition and to administer a direct debit system,
which we're offering to fans to spread the cost'.
Yet, football fans do not even know what teams they will see, since the draw
will not be held until December 1995. For now, they are simply buying seats
at a ground.
Steve Beauchampe, of the Football Supporters' Association, says: 'One reason
for such early ticket sales is that the FA needs to be sure that it will
sell out all the matches. Some of the less attractive games may be a
struggle.'
The FA expects to raise about Pounds 60m if all matches sell out. What
happens to that cash, and the interest it generates? Answer: the money goes
into a trust fund account and. after expenses, the profit is split between
Uefa, soccer's European governing body, and the FA.
Music promoters also are keen to get their hands on your money early. A US
rock group, REM, will play big British stadiums next July - but tickets,
costing Pounds 23, went on sale on October 22, nine months in advance. How
does Paul Flower, marketing manager of promoter MCP, justify that?
'REM is one of the world's biggest bands. They haven't played in Britain for
five years and have had three No 1 albums. We want to make sure that
everyone who wants to see them can.' Flower declined to say where the money
went, and to whom, but said advertising and venues had to be paid for and
groups needed cash to hire equipment and finance often-elaborate shows.
Nick Blackburn, sales and marketing director of Ticketmaster, a leading
ticket agency, says: 'I sympathise with promoters, who take big risks and
who are being squeezed on deals. But customers need protection. We sold
Pounds  1/4 m-worth of tickets for a UK tour by the Bolshoi Ballet this
summer but the promoter, Derek Block, went under before the concerts took
place. We had passed the money on to Derek Block, so we had no money for
refunds.'
If a promoter fails, the prospects are bleak. Susan Hayward of the
Consumers' Association (CA), says: 'The ticket-holder has a contract with
the promoter, not the agent. Under the Consumer Credit Act, if the tickets
cost more than Pounds 100 each, are paid for by credit card and payment is
to the promoter direct, the credit card company must pay compensation if the
promoter fails. But most payments are made via an agent.'
Ticketmaster decided to refund Bolshoi clients from its own pocket.
Blackburn says: 'It's hard to see what lesson can be learnt from this
experience. Promoters and acts continue to press for ticket money.
'I'd like to see an escrow fund - from which ticket money is not released to
the promoter until the show - which would protect the public.' The CA would
like to see a bond scheme, similar to that in the travel industry.
Harvey Goldsmith, a rock music promoter who has put on shows by Pink Floyd
and Elton John, is chairman of the Concert Promoters' Association. 'We are
encouraging ticket agents to come up with a code of practice, being drawn up
with the help of the Office of Fair Trading,' he says.
Why did tickets go on sale so early? 'Because people buy tickets with
'today's money'. If we wait and put tickets on sale all at once for 10
different shows next summer, people won't have the money to buy all they
want. We try to stagger ticket availability and give people time to buy - or
they go mad at us.'
