   Australian pop group INXS won five
trophies at the fifth annual MTV Awards for its ``Need You
Tonight-Mediate'' video, and Prince and the British group Squeeze
won two each.
   INXS won best video, best group video, best editing in a video
and best breakthrough video for technical innovation. It also won a
viewer's choice award, voted on by MTV audience during the week by
calling a special telephone number.
   Wednesday night's show with Arsenio Hall as host was broadcast
live on MTV from the Universal Amphitheater and has been sold in
syndication for rebroadcast on non-cable channels.
   INXS, whose ``Need You Tonight'' video includes a rich overlay
of images of the band performing, had the most nominations, eight,
followed by five for former Beatle George Harrison, who was blanked.
   Backstage, INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence said the group,
which formed in Sydney in 1977, does not consider videos first when
writing music.
   ``Videos have nothing to do with music, really,'' said
Hutchence. ``You sit around (saying) `This is my music.' You have a
good time, you make records, and comes the day you start thinking
about what it will look like on film.''
   Prince's clip of a concert performance of ``U Got The Look'' won
best male video and best concert video. The purple master from
Minnesota was in England and did not pick up his trophies.
   Squeeze's ``Hourglass'' video won technical awards for best art
direction and best special effects.
   Suzanne Vega's ``Luka,'' a song about child abuse, won best
female video.
   ``I have known some abused children, and there is a boy named
Luka in my apartment, who is not an abused child, and I used his
name,'' Ms. Vega said of the song.
   Los Lobos' ``La Bamba,'' from the movie of that name about the
short life of 1950s rock star Ritchie Valens, won best video from a
movie.
   ``It wasn't our career, it was someone else's career,'' group
member Conrad Lozano said backstage, referring to Valens. But
Lozano said the group was proud to do the song.
   Rock veterans Pink Floyd's ``Learning to Fly'' won best concept
video. George Michael's ``Father Figure'' won best direction, while
Sting's ``We'll Be Together'' won best cinematography.
   Pop superstar Michael Jackson, whose ``Thriller'' and ``Beat
It'' helped MTV take off when it started in 1983, was given a Video
Vanguard award for career achievement.
   He appeared via satellite from London. Later in the show, sister
Janet's choreography nomination for ``The Pleasure Principle'' beat
Michael's nominations for ``Bad'' and ``The Way You Make Me Feel''
in the category.
   Guns 'n' Roses, a Los Angeles heavy metal band, won best new
artist in a video for its raucous ``Welcome To The Jungle.''
   The award was accepted by group member Slash, accompanied by
former teen porn star Traci Lords.
   The nominees for this year were selected from 644 videos
broadcast on MTV from May 2, 1987, to April 1, 1988. The finalists
were narrowed down by votes from music business professionals,
journalists, agents and artists. A smaller voting body of 1,800
music professionals, technicians and video creators selected the
winners.
