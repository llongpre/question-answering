Prize is likely to raise some hackles in the music industry

What would we do without arts prizes? The Turner gets the conceptualists and
the painters at each other's throats and the Booker sets post-modernists
against readers. And now the Mercury Prize for the British pop album of the
year is shaping up nicely to make many music people very cross. This is the
third year in which ten albums have been short listed by 'experts' to
compete for Pounds 25,000 - and a barrage of promotional opportunities.
Inevitably the award goes to a band that hardly needs it - last year Suede
generously gave the money away, although, like the 1992 winner Primal
Scream, it probably expected a bigger career boost from the prize than
actually happened. This year's ten albums suggest the careful mix and match
of a finely balanced committee. There is a representative from most of the
myriad faces of pop - except one.
There is no room for the Establishment. Albums by the Rolling Stones, Elvis
Costello and Kate Bush made the final 20, and then stalled. Pink Floyd
failed to get even that far. The Mercury is obviously going in for a bit of
proselytising, for the shock of the new, but in the most balanced way.
So what is on offer? The only big name listed is Paul Weller who, with Wild
Wood, has contributed the whimsical hippy album. This is what happens to
abrasive young punkers when the pop business gets to them, especially in the
wallet. The lyrics go nowhere, slowly, and the melodies come packaged from
some Californian dream factory. What a contrast this is to the punk album on
the list, from the Ulster band Therapy. Troublegum hits you like a
sledgehammer, and does not loosen its grip through a welter of songs which
are almost a parody of life seen from the gutter. So much youthful angst, so
much raw energy and power - it is as stimulating as Weller is soporific.
The inevitable black soul entry this year is Shara Nelson with What Silence
Knows. She has more genuine emotion than last year's representative of this
form, Dina Carroll, and seems equally happy with the heart-torn ballad and
the old fashioned disco whirl.
This is much easier listening that the pseudo-classical contestant, Michael
Nyman's The Piano Concerto which shares the CD with TGV, his pean to the
French express train. Nyman takes a tiny little tune and adds layer after
layer of sound, breaking the back of the simple melody. The Piano Concerto
was originally the soundtrack of Jane Campion's movie The Piano and has that
unneccessary, background, feel to it.
There must be an album to keep the largest sector of the pop buying public,
young girls, happy, and naturally Take That's Everything Changes makes the
top ten. Gary Barlow writes some very infectious songs: indeed the band is
much better than its hunk poster image, and if Take That are very clever
they could avoid the inevitable three year life span that dogs pretty boy
bands and become a serious music making machine.
Old rockers will like Ian McNabb's Head Like a Rock, which keeps the Bruce
Springsteen tradition alive. Little surprise that it was recorded in LA with
Neil Young's backing band, Crazy Horse. With its crashing chords and
harmonious melodies, this will restore the faith of jaded 30 year olds in
the redemptive power of pop.
Naturally there has to be a 'British' pop album and what better than Blur's
Parklife. This is how todays youth likes to see itself: urban, street wise,
funky, and basically light hearted. There is something of Madness, something
of Squeeze in this generous hotchpotch of 16 songs. It is slightly too sharp
for its own naivety, but anyone wanting a musical commentary on Major's
Britain could hardly do better.
When the young are not being cheeky they are dancing, and the three dance
albums included once again neatly cover the musical range. His'n'hers by
Pulp is what might happen at a suburban diso when filtered through the ears
of an imaginative spectator; Music for the Jilted Generation by The Prodigy
is hard core techno rave, pretty unrelieved, insistent, body jerking, stuff;
and M-People's Elegant Slumming is the type of disco music loved both by
inveterate clubbers and the Christmas office party crowd.
To build up more excitement before the announcement on September 13, the
organisers of the Mercury Prize have persuaded William Hill to give odds on
the contestants. Blur is favourite at 2-1, with Take That at 7-2. My choice
would be M-People (5-1), not because it is likely to win  - it is too light
heartedly predictable to carry weight with the judges - but because it has
all the virtues of good pop: immediate accessibility, a wonderful beat, and
insidiously memorable melodies. You recognise such hit singles from it as
'One Night in Heaven' and 'Moving on Up' from their opening bars because
they are the songs that are played in the boutiques, the hairdressers, the
sounds of the age.
The Mercury Prize helps to give the chaotic pop world some shape and
substance but it still seems to skim the surface of the art form. No regrets
at the failure of dreary, one dimensional, rappers to make the list, but why
no jazz, currently enjoying yet another revival; or big band blues; or
country? Still the sampler, which includes a track from each album, should
be out in the next two weeks, and gives an instant run-down on the current
state of British pop.
