A Pink Floyd concert in Venice, Italy, turned into a fiasco Saturday night when 
police moved in on about 200,000 youths who had packed into St. Mark's Square 
and broken through barriers. Eighty people were reportedly hurt. The band 
played a 90-minute show from a barge the size of a football field anchored in a 
lagoon in front of St. Mark's Square. (Venice has no stadium.) Fans who had 
camped out for as long as 14 hours for the free concert crammed into the 
Piazzetta, a rectangular extension outside St. Mark's Square before they were 
chased away, leaving the group with only an elite local audience in private 
boats -- and the claimed 200 million worldwide television audience. During the 
TV transmission of the 90-minute show, however, not one of the 15 cameras was 
ever aimed at the deserted Piazzetta, empty except for debris. The show's 
producer, the state-owned RAI network, and Granada, sold the concert on the 
basis of the unusual setting. The group's normal performance was hampered by 
orders to keep their amplified sound down to 60 decibels -- a fraction of their 
usual volume. This was a last-minute demand from city officials based on 
concerns that higher sound levels could damage the historic buildings. Claudia
