Pink Floyd are the best of pop - and the worst. Currently filling Earl's
Court for an unprecedented 14 nights, they are a mass of contradictions.
The songs evoke a druggy dreamworld of hippie indolence a generation old,
yet are programmed with a computerised precision that Captain Kirk would
admire. The lyrics are often heavy with revolutionary fervour yet the band,
or rather the three that survive, enjoy all the privileges of the ultra
rich. The music encourages you to close your eyes and trip, yet everyone at
the concert is tense and alert for the next mind-blowing explosion of
techno-trickery.
The Floyd long ago realised that their music was irredeemably archaic and
that to survive they must become showmen. Lacking personalities, they sold
their souls to the backroom boys: you leave the concert singing the special
effects rather than the tracks from the new album, The Division Bell.
As you wait for the band to appear you are titillated with bird song and a
tolling tocsin; then comes the dry ice and the brilliant blinding spotlights
and green, red and yellow laser beams. It is like being bombarded with
innocuous friendly fire.
To help keep you awake during the many songs that meander into banality, a
giant tambourine-shaped screen offers helpful images of spliff-toting
beatniks, Cambridge colleges, and flying bedsteads, which just fail to make
sense but are very decorative.
When the music lapses into especially monotonous doodling you know the Floyd
have a cracker up their sleeves. Look out for the model aircraft screeching
across the Arena to explode near the stage; and there go the flares, pumping
fire into the air again and again while the Floyd's motifs, giant
polystyrene pigs, poke their heads above the stage, eyes piercing the
audience.
Occasionally the adrenalin shot comes from the music, from 'The Wall', in
which the three ululating girl backing singers break into brutal cockney,
and an abusively sneering 'Hey Teacher' breaks out in lights at the front of
the stage. It all comes right near the end, too, when, against images of
world leaders slipping and sliding, grinning and fibbing and generally
making fools of themselves, Pink Floyd play their 20-year-old classic, 'Dark
side of the moon'.
What holds the show together is Dave Gilmour, the guitarist, who stands
centre stage and bravely despatches guitar licks back through the decades.
Like Rick Wright on keyboards and Nick Mason on drums, Gilmour has a
doppleganger, a shadowy fellow musician who discreetly earns his fee, and
pumps out the sound to pomp mark 10. Despite the millions invested in the
hardware at least the Floyd are professional enough to turn up.
The Floyd's success drives the critics mad: there must be something wrong
when fans fawn on 50-year-olds pumping out music unchanged since 1970. What
is wrong is current pop. It is a safe bet that in a century's time audiences
will sit in respectfiul approval at re-creations of Pink Floyd concerts.
There are very few other bands assured of such prospective immortality.
