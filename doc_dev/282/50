<LEADPARA>  ALTHOUGH Guns and Roses has gotten all the press, Metallica claimed the heavy
metal crown with its 2 1/2-hour performance at the Oakland Coliseum
Saturday.The band, which headlined this year's only Day on the Green, (backed
by Queensryche, Faith No More and Soundgarden) put out the kind of dark,
frantic and savage energy that defines heavy metal. In contrast, at Shoreline
this summer Axl Rose and crew were nothing more than pop crooners.;   But the
music wasn't the thing that stood out most at this 7 1/2-hour tribal festival.
Violence and fistfights were as much a part of the show as the music.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Heavy metal attracts violence; it's part of the experience. But it's one
thing to see it in a club or small hall. To see it spread over 54,000 people,
most of them teens, is eye-opening.;   It started during Soundgarden and Faith
No More all through the outfield. Groups of males would begin running,
dancing, skipping in counterclockwise circles. (They call it "Mosh" -- or
being in "the Pit.") Anyone in the Mosh can do anything to anyone else.
Usually, this means pushing, elbowing or hitting them with a forearm. But
often, they exploded into savage fistfights.;   "All the energy gets in you,
dude, and you go for it," said Jeremy Wood, 18, a high school student from San
Jose. "You just go crazy. You lose control. You've got to be violent to live
in there.";   During the break before Queensryche took the stage, the fights
became the entertainment. One vicious brawl began on the left side of the
field and spread through the audience, like a huge bar fight. After punching
out about a dozen men, one shirtless man raised his hands like Rocky, to
cheers from the stands.;   Then, during the break before Metallica -- and when
the band took the stage 10 minutes late -- the whole place went crazy. First,
they threw empty cups, creating what looked like a snowstorm of white paper.
Then, upper sections began dumping full cups of soda on people below, and a
mass fight started.;   On the lawn, people grabbed turf and threw it, the mass
action filling the air with what looked like a giant swarm of bees.;   "Looks
like you all went nutty, motherf------s," were guitarist James Hetfield's
first words after opening with "Enter Sandman," from the band's new album.;  
Despite the frenzied fights and brawls, there were only a few arrests on minor
charges, according to an Oakland police spokesman.;   Most of the violence
subsided as fans stood entranced through Metallica's set of old slashing speed
metal, and newer, more musical songs of a band perched to become one of the
nation's hottest groups.;   "I came here to drink beer and kick ass," Hetfield
said before beginning "Harvester of Sorrow." "I'm all out of beer.";   This
was the first time the band performed much of the material from its self-named
album and although it marked a change in direction from its earlier thrash
metal days, it was well received. Even though the new work is more accessible
than anything the group has done in its 10-year history -- some of it is
acoustic -- it still has a dark, explosive edge that keeps it from ever being
confused with mainstream music.;   The band hasn't compromised. Every song
still is based on minor, haunted-house chords. They have no pop power anthems;
nothing they do shows much hope. What mainstream group would have an audience
chanting a chorus of "Die, Die Die?" (Yes, at times it seemed like Spinal
Tap.);   And not many other groups push songs to the edge, letting individual
members take a song and go crazy with it. Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and
Hetfield soared on a lengthy version of "Holier Than Thou," which was one of
the encores. Drummer Lars Ulrich and bassist Jason Newsted formed a bottom
that vibrated the back rows of the Coliseum during "The Unforgiven," "Through
the Never" and "Master of Puppets.";   Newsted, who also soloed with a wah-wah
pedal that made his instrument sound like it was saying "why, why," played
more complex bass than one would expect from heavy metal.;   Overall, the
Northern California fans who have followed the band for years came out knowing
that Metallica had finally arrived without selling out. The group's brand of
raucous thrash music had moved from dark club stages to filling stadiums.;  
The 75-minute set by Seattle's Queensryche was far less inspiring. At its
best, the band brought to mind Pink Floyd, but more often resembled the bland
pop of Journey. It did not get called back for an encore.;   Bay Area band
Faith No More gave an intelligent, rocking one-hour set. They played most of
their 1989 album "The Real Thing," including "Epic," which is perhaps the best
song to combine heavy metal chords with rap vocals. They ended with Black
Sabbath's "War Pigs.";   Seattle's Soundgarden, which plays with a style that
brings to mind Led Zeppelin, may be where Metallica was five years ago when it
opened a Monsters of Rock tour. Their 45-minute set showed a lot of potential.  </TEXT>
