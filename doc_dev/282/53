<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old man has pleaded guilty
to trying to sell a dozen Pink Floyd tickets to the wrong guy _ a
man who reported the tickets stolen in a house break-in two days
before.
   In an agreement, Karl C. Hubble of Detroit pleaded guilty Monday
to possession of stolen property less than $100, a misdemeanor. He
was fined $60.
   Police said Hubble was trying to sell the block of tickets
outside an Aug. 16 concert at the Palace by the British rock group.
   Douglas Coxen, 21, approached him and recognized the tickets. He
told Hubble he would be right back with more money.
   Coxen came back, along with a police officer.
   Since Coxen bought the tickets with a credit card, stadium
officials were able to confirm the tickets were his, and Coxen and
11 pals enjoyed the show.
   Police said Hubble is not suspected in the break-in or ticket
theft, and has promised to cooperate with an investigation.
