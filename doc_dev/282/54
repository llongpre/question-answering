   More than 100,000 fans were wild
delight as Paul McCartney launched into ``I Saw Her Standing
There,'' and ``Back in the U.S.S.R.'' during an all-star charity
concert.
   Pouring rain failed to dampen spirits at the charity concert at
Knebworth Park, 20 miles north of London late Saturday. Most fans
came prepared with umbrellas and plastic raincoats, but the sun
eventually broke through.
   The lineup included Elton John, Status Quo, Cliff Richard, The
Shadows, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Robert Plant
and Pink Floyd.
   All donated their time to help raise the equivalent of $10.5
million for handicapped children and young musicians.
   The money will be divided evenly between the Nordoff-Robbins
music therapy project, which uses music to motivate children with
mental, physical or emotional difficulties, and a new school for
performing arts.
   Despite a heavy downpour as Tears for Fears kicked off the
day-long extravaganza, fans from all over the country were quick to
join in.
   Old favorites Status Quo got the crowd going with ``Rockin' All
Over the World.'' And Cliff Richard accompanied by The Shadows
received thunderous applause for ``Summer Holiday.''
   One of the biggest cheers of the night was for former Beatle
McCartney, who was introduced by James Bond star Timothy Dalton.
   The concert was televised around the world.
