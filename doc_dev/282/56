<LEADPARA>  (check) Country singer Lorrie Morgan tied the knot Sunday, marrying Clint
Black's bus driver, Brad Thompson, in Madison, Tenn. The bride and groom met
more than a year ago when Morgan, Black and Merle Haggard toured together.
It's the third marriage for Morgan.;   (check) Jamie Lee Curtis teamed up with
an electronics company and a video chain to donate hundreds of VCRs and movies
to Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh. Curtis said she arranged the donation in
memory of Lori Tull, an Illinois woman who had two heart transplants at
Children's before she died last year at age 20.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) Jimmy Dean, of sausage-making and country music fame, married Donna
Meade, a former Nashville nightclub singer, Sunday at the couple's home in
Varina, Va. The reception featured a riverboat cruise for 200 guests on the
James River. This is the second time down the aisle for both.;   (check)
Guitarist Steve O'Rourke broke a leg and two other musicians in the Pink Floyd
rock band were slightly injured when their car overshot an embankment at a car
race in Mexico. O'Rourke and guitarist David Gilmour were flown to a Houston
hospital early Tuesday.;   (check) One of several pregnancies (or almost
pregnancies) highlighted on TV this season is that of Candice Bergen's "Murphy
Brown." Jane Pauley asked Bergen about this and was told: "I certainly don't
think Murphy is going to be a traditional mom. I mean, Betty Crocker was not
her role model; it was more like Mike Wallace. But I think that Murphy would
be a ferocious mom and I think she would teach a kid certain skills; poker,
for example.";   (check) The Irish rock group U2 has stormed to the top of the
British charts with its new single, "The Fly," ending Canadian Bryan Adams'
record 16-week reign at the top with "Everything I Do." But critics blasted
the Irish rockers for using "underhanded tactics" by putting the record --
their first in two years -- on sale for only three weeks.  </TEXT>
