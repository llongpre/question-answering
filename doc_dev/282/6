   A huge styrofoam wall at the site of the
shattered Berlin Wall is the setting for a concert by ex-Pink Floyd
guitarist Roger Waters, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Sinead
O'Connor and others.
   About 180,000 fans were expected at tonight's outdoor spectacle
that is raising money for victims of disasters, and whose
centerpiece is a performance of Pink Floyd's 11-year-old rock epic,
``The Wall.''
   Waters, who composed ``The Wall'' but has since left the group
for a solo career, is headlining the extravaganza.
   The celebrated record, which was made into a movie in 1982, is
about alienation and the manipulation of the minds of individuals
by governments, but not specifically about the Berlin Wall.
   A giant 600-foot-long and 60-foot-high structure made of 2,500
styrofoam bricks will come crashing down at the concert's climax.
   The concert also will feature a six-story inflatable pig and an
equally large teacher, two characters in Pink Floyd's atmospheric,
other-worldly music.
   Workers for weeks have been building the gigantic stage on 35
acres of Potsdamer Platz, the historic square of old Berlin that
was converted into a desolate no-man's land by the building of the
Berlin Wall.
   All of the Berlin Wall at Potsdamer Platz has been torn down in
the last few months in anticipation of the unification of the
German states in December.
   The stretch of land between the two sections of wall, where East
Germans were once shot and killed while fleeing to the West, was
expected to hold about 180,000 concertgoers for tonight's show.
   More than 160,000 tickets have been sold at $30 each and 20,000
additional tickets were to go on sale today, said spokeswoman Emma
Jenks.
   ``The stage crew alone is literally hundreds and hundreds of
people,'' she said Friday.
   Others slated to perform tonight included Cindy Lauper, James
Galway, Thomas Dolby, Albert Finney, model Jerry Hall, the
Chieftains, the Scorpions, the Hooters and the East Berlin Rundfunk
Symphony Orchestra and Radio Choir.
   The concert cost $8 million to stage and profits from the show,
as well as a planned album and video, are to go to the Memorial
Fund for Disaster Relief, Jenks said.
   The London-based fund was set up last year to create a permanent
reservoir of cash for disaster relief.
   The European Community on Friday said it would donate $378,000
to the concert.
   Jenks said organizers would not know until after the concert how
much of the proceeds, expected to approach $10 million, would go to
the disaster relief fund after expenses.
