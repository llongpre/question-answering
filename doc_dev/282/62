   BAIE-STE-CATHERINE, Quebec (AP) _ Prince Andrew has become the
prince of whales.
   Britain's Duke of York and his Duchess, Sarah Ferguson, adopted
an endangered beluga and named it White Mischief. The couple took
the action Monday while on a whale-watching tour from this port on
the St. Lawrence River about 125 miles northeast of Quebec City.
   The newest and largest addition to the Royal Family wasn't seen,
however, and in fact hasn't been seen since 1987.
   The royal couple, on a 13-day Canadian tour, join 44 other people
who have paid $5,000 each to adopt belugas _ white whales about 12
feet long. Prince Andrew's whale, however, was a gift from the
Charlevoix Tourist Association.
   The adopt-a-beluga program helps fund studies of the 500 whales
who live in this part of the polluted St. Lawrence River.
   The duke and duchess were due in Montreal today before flying on
to Saskatchewan.

   A woman accused of sending actor Michael J.
Fox nearly 6,000 threatening letters has pleaded innocent to felony
charges of making terrorist threats.
   Tina Marie-Ledbetter, 26, of Camarillo, on Monday was ordered to
remain without bail in the Sybil Brand Institute for Women, said
Deputy District Attorney Susan Gruber.
   Fox, 27, received nearly all the letters over the course of a
year, with 800 arriving last July, the month he married actress
Tracy Pollan, prosecutors said.
   ``Divorce Tracy or you are dead!'' one letter said.
   Fox did not attend Monday's arraignment, but he testified in a
preliminary hearing in May that he had worried about his family's
safety.
   Fox starred in the former television series ``Family Ties,'' and
was featured in such movies as ``Back to the Future'' and ``Bright
Lights, Big City.''

   A Pink Floyd rock concert that left St.
Mark's Square covered with garbage has turned into a political
nightmare for local officials.
   The Venice city government offered to resign Monday after civic
groups condemned the officials for not providing hotel, first aid,
toilet and other facilities for the estimated 200,000 people who
attended the free show.
   Mayor Antonio Casellati said he and members of city council would
offer their resignations to the five political parties forming the
governing coalition. He said the parties had to decide on
regulations for use of the historic city.
   Angry citizens interrupted Casellati with shouts of ``Resign!''
and ``Get out!''
   Saturday night's concert by the British group set a record for
attendance at an Italian rock event. The band played on a floating
barge near St. Mark's, and fans watched from the piazza and from
rooftops.
   Workers were still cleaning Monday.

   It worked for actor Paul Newman, so Frank
Sinatra has decided to market his own spaghetti sauce. But he won't
be chairman of the board.
   Sinatra is helping form a company to market Italian-style food
products, said his spokeswoman, Susan Reynolds.
   The company is called Artanis _ Sinatra in reverse _ and the
first line of sauce is due out early in 1990, she said.
   ``Over the years I've received some nice compliments about my
cooking,'' Sinatra said in a statement issued Monday. ``A few years
ago, we made some pasta sauce for our friends during the holiday
season and it's become a tradition.''
   William J. Armanino, president of the San Francisco-based
Armanino Foods Distribution Inc., will act as chairman of the
company, Reynolds said.

   Ronald Peters, who federal authorities say
was Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose's bookie, has begun his
two-year prison term on drug and tax charges.
   On Monday, before he left for the federal prison in Terre Haute,
Ind., Peters said he was looking forward to an end of publicity
surrounding his case.
   ``Seeing your face in the paper every day and on the news _ I'm
sure it's going to be a while before my face gets in the paper again
_ just to get away from all that for a while will be nice,'' Peters
said.
   Peters, 32, former owner of a restaurant and tanning salon in
this southwestern Ohio town, pleaded guilty to federal charges of
cocaine distribution and making false statements on his 1985 income
tax return.
   Major League baseball executives are investigating Rose's
gambling, and a federal grand jury in Cincinnati is investigating
whether he reported all taxable income. Rose denies any wrongdoing.
   Peters hopes to transfer to a halfway house after a year, and
said his sentence could be reduced by six months for good behavior.
   He said he will live in a dormitory at the prison, which has
tennis courts, a putting green and educational courses. Peters is a
former golf teaching professional.
