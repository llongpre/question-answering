   David Glasper is proud to be part of a ``pop''
band.
   ``As soon as you say that word, people sneer at it,'' said
Glasper, lead singer of the English group Breathe.
   ``The Beatles played it, the Stones played it. We just want to be
generally accepted. If we've written a handful of classic records,
we would have achieved what we wanted to do.''
   But acceptance for pop stars means hit singles, and Breathe had
to endure an unimaginably difficult road in working to get its songs
played on the radio. Their debut album, ``All That Jazz,'' was
released in August 1987, and proceeded to go nowhere. Worse, the
group feuded with its manager and the two sides parted ways.
   ``He was frustrated,'' Glasper said. ``We had released seven
singles in the United Kingdom to no avail. We were wondering what we
could do. You're bound to start questioning things.''
   And questioning each other.
   ``Because we took so long to happen, the relationship became
really strained. We were all just screaming at each other,'' he said.
   The story of Breathe, however, was to take an unexpected turn for
the better in 1988. ``Hands to Heaven,'' the album's second single,
began getting heavy airplay on American adult contemporary stations
and eventually became a Top 20 hit on the pop charts.
   ``It's a song we really believed in,'' Glasper said. ``It's about
separation. A man married for 50 years called a radio station in
Chicago and said the song was for him. He had been to the Navy and
had been away from his wife a lot.''
   Glasper, now in his mid-20s, grew up in the suburbs of London and
showed an early interest in music. ``I've always been singing. I
used to walk around the house humming. I was involved in choir at
school. I was brought up on the Doobie Brothers, Led Zeppelin, Pink
Floyd, music like that.''
   He and his childhood friend, guitarist Marcus Lillington, formed
Breathe with drummer Ian Spice and bassist MIck Delahunty in the
early 1980s.
   ``We used to massacre classic records like `Stairway to Heaven'
and `It's Different for Girls,''' Glasper recalled. ``Then we
started experimenting. It's like a craft.''
   They also had to experiment with giving the group a name. They
started with Catch-22 and ran through several others before settling
on Breathe.
   ``The name was never a concious decision,'' Glasper said. ``We
were looking to change our name when we decided to use Breathe for a
local gig because we had a song of that name on the posters.''
   Breathe began recording its first record back in 1985, a little
too soon in Glasper's opinion.
   ``Our band hadn't really jelled into any one thing. We spent a
lot of time in the studio writing and experimenting. Towards the
later stage of the album, we kind of found out what kind of band
we'd like to be,'' he said.
   What hurt the group, Glasper said, was management's emphasis on a
major selling point for most pop bands: appearance.
   ``We were four young guys. It doesn't take much business acumen
to see we could have appeal to teen-age girls. But we realized that
we wanted to be involved in songwriting and prove ourselves that
way. Our first manager used to scream at us about image.''
   Ironically, Breathe ended up making its breakthrough in the
United States with an older audience.
   ```Hands to Heaven' is quite a mature sounding record. People
thought we were a lot older than we actually were,'' Glasper said.
   But he found that being called an ``adult contemporary'' band has
its drawbacks, too, and promised that the group would do something
about it.
   ``We've got really stuck into an image like Chicago or Air
Supply, but we have some uptempo songs written for the next album.
There's going to be a big ballad, but we've got a lot of faster
songs,'' he said.
   ``I know that the songs we've written at the moment are not our
best. It's exciting because we don't know what we'll end up sounding
like.''
   One of the new songs is called ``Satisfy'' and Glasper has good
reason to feel pleased. ``How Can I Fall,'' the second single from
``All That Jazz,'' is selling well and the album itself has cracked
the Top 40.
   ``When we first finished recording `All That Jazz,' we started
thinking, `Can we write songs?' And then there came a point where
nothing had happened and we asked what were we doing wrong. We were
getting paranoid,'' he said.
   ``It was such a relief that the record was a hit and we could
say, `Yeah I told you so.'''
