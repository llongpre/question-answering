The British rock Establishment's big summer charity bash comes across as a 
staid affair indeed on this unimaginative, often leaden double live album. 
Virtually everything, from the few reasonably good performances (Elton John, 
Paul McCartney, Dire Straits), to the preponderance of bad to mediocre ones 
(Genesis, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton, Robert Plant) is overly familiar and 
available in better renditions elsewhere. Passable Tears For Fears and trivial 
Status Quo and Cliff Richard performances round out this two-hour plus stroll 
through well-intentioned boredom. MIKE BOEHM
