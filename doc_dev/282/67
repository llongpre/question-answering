   Charlton Heston says Laurence Olivier once
consoled him by saying good reviews are more dangerous than bad ones.
   Heston spoke on Wednesday of his professional association with
the actor, who died Tuesday in London at the age of 82.
   Heston, who starred with the British actor in the 1966 film
``Khartoum,'' said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that Olivier
offered him advice the night a 1960 Broadway play Heston was in
flopped on opening night.
   Called ``The Tumbler,'' the show was directed by Olivier.
   ``He looked at me and gripped my shoulder and said, `Chuck,
what's much, much more important and much harder is you have to
learn to forget the good notices.' That's true. Good notices have
hurt more actors than bad notices ever did,'' Heston said.

   The new movie on the life of rock 'n' roll
pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis draws a trivial portrait of a complex and
explosive personality, says the co-author of a book on which the
film is based.
   ``Once again, Hollywood has people laughing at him, saying
``Ain't he a hoot,'' said Murray Silver, co-author of ``Great Balls
of Fire,'' a Lewis biography published in 1982. Silver wrote the
book with Lewis' former wife Myra.
   ``You could say a lot of things about Jerry Lee,'' Silver said in
an interview published Wednesday in the Commercial Appeal in
Memphis. ``You could call him a wife-beater. You could call him wild
and reckless. You could call him anything but phony. The movie was
phony. It trivialized some very serious happenings.''
   A piano player and singer known for outrageous stage performances
and a tumultuous private life, Lewis, now 53, is on his sixth
marriage.
   The movie, starring Dennis Quaid and also called ``Great Balls of
Fire,'' is based on a brief period in the late 1950s when Lewis'
promising career was derailed by a scandal over from his marriage to
Myra Brown, his 13-year-old cousin.

   John Salley, a member of the NBA champion Detroit
Pistons, says he's negotiating to buy the mansion of the late Roman
Catholic Cardinal John Dearden.
   The Pistons forward, who lives in the suburb of Southfield,
confirmed his interest Tuesday in the mansion, located in one of the
wealthiest Detroit neighborhoods.
   A spokesman for the Detroit Archdiocese, Jay Berman, confirmed
that the house was being sold, though he wouldn't say to whom.
   He said the deal would be closed after a routine city inspection
of the house, which has high ceilings _ Salley is 7 feet tall _ and
a chapel.

   Edwards, 61, filed the divorce petition and a concurring answer
from his 60-year-old wife, Elaine, on Tuesday. They married in 1949
and have four children, ages 29 to 39.
   ``We have always been good friends, we are now and ever will
be,'' the governor said in a statement. Edwards was elected governor

   Pete Rose doesn't have any financial
difficulties, if his publisher is any judge.
   ``We owe Pete a lot of money on the book,'' William Rosen said
Tuesday, ``and he hasn't asked us for a dime.''
   Rose's prolonged battle with baseball over allegations that he
bet on games will likely alter the schedule of the autobiography due
to be published next spring.
   The publisher for Macmillan and Collier Books said the manuscript
has the Cincinnati Reds manager admitting to gambling on racehorses
and the Super Bowl. The manuscript was written by Roger Kahn, author
of the bestselling ``Boys of Summer.''
   ``We have a wonderful book, but now it needs to be rewritten and
reshaped,'' Rosen said. ``Pete will speak directly on the issue of
whether he gambled on baseball games.''
   Rose has denied betting on baseball.

   A Pink Floyd concert planned for a floating
stage in Venice is in danger of being called off by city officials
who said Wednesday they are worried the noise could damage monuments
in the ancient canal city.
   The City Council told organizers that the office of monument
protection is worried about damage to buildings in nearby St. Mark's
Piazza.
   Organizers have suggested lowering the volume, but city officials
have not given the OK for the British rock group to perform as
scheduled Saturday.
   Promotors had planned to set up special buffers in the lagoon to
absorb the sound.
   The concert is to be free, and spectators plan to watch it from
boats, rooftops and the shore.
