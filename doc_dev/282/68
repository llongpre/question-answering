MUSIC: KCRW-FM (89.9) will pay tribute to two musical giants, Irving Berlin and 
Louis Armstrong. Host Ian Whitcomb features rare and unusual recordings of 
Berlin songs from noon until 3 p.m. One such piece will be "Reaching for the 
Moon" which was deleted from the 1929 movie of the same title. Berlin is heard 
singing "This Is the Army Mr. Jones" from his 1942 Broadway Review "This Is the 
Army." A patriotic Berlin wrote the review to help the war cause, according to 
program host Whitcomb, who said of the composer's rare recordings, "People 
forget that he was a performer before he became a song writer. He was probably 
very critical of himself."

Also on KCRW, from 3 to 5 p.m. Louis Armstrong, who would have been 90 years 
old today, is revealed via recorded interviews with Armstrong himself as well 
as other musicians and music critics. Host Billy Taylor explores Armstrong's 
influence on the Swing Era and modern pop music.
