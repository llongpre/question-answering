<LEADPARA>  Two years ago, John Burger decided to indulge a fantasy and legally change his

<HEADLINE>  MR. ZEPPELIN WANTS TO CHANGE HIS TUNE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But Mr. Zeppelin, a welder, recently began looking for a job and discovered
that prospective employers were confused by an applicant named after a rock
band.;    Zeppelin, 27, filed another petition Thursday in Santa Clara County
Superior Court to change his name. This time, he wants to be Tone Wells.;   
"I liked the name of the (musical) group Tony! Toni! Tone!" he said. "I got
Wells from Wells Fargo.";    In the beginning, he explained, Led Zeppelin was
a fine name. He considered Pink Floyd or Black Sabbath but decided he didn't
want a color for a first name.;    But in court documents, Zeppelin, of San
Jose, explained the problem: "Petitioner's present name is not taken seriously
by employer.";    And, he said, people have gotten the wrong impression about
him.;    "A lot of people think I have a shrine or something for the band," he
said. "I only have three of their CDs. I never really got into music that
hard. I'm more into Phil Collins, people like that.";    But even today, back
in his hometown of Chicago, Zeppelin said the song remains the same: "My mom
still calls me John."  </TEXT>
