   A small group of sign-waving protesters
confronted people attending a concert by the British rock group
Pink Floyd, and many fans responded with shouts of ``Pink Floyd.''
   ``All of them are going to hell,'' said David Tribb, 34, who
carried a wooden cross and was one of eight members of a college
ministry preaching to about 1,000 concert-goers outside the stadium
Saturday night.
   The concert, the first permitted at the 66-year-old stadium at
Ohio State University, drew about 62,000 fans. One man collapsed
while waiting to enter the stadium, but there were no reports of
serious injury.
   More than 160 Franklin County sheriff's deputies and university
and city police officers were on hand to control the crowd.
Security officers checked concert-goers to prevent them from taking
alcohol inside the stadium.
