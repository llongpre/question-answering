   Nothing she did the past 10 years, Basia says
now, prepared her to become an overnight sensation.
   There was the obligatory dues paying: the years of belting out
jingles for commercials, backing up other vocalists, singing for
Top-40 groups in the United States and England. There was even her
first album, ``Time and Tide,'' that seemed to grow slowly but
surely on a worldwide audience.
   But then came a second hit album, ``London-Warsaw-New York,''
and a frenetic world tour that has turned everything upside down.
   ``It's been traumatic so far,'' the Polish-born pop singer,
whose full name is Basia Trzetrzelewska, said with a giggle. But
it's been a good kind of trauma, the ebullient young woman confided.
   And even a recent bout with a virus that forced her to cancel
two shows on her summer U.S. tour and left her normally languid
voice slightly raspy couldn't dampen her spirits during a recent
phone interview from Chicago.
   ``I'm enjoying this tour so much now,'' she said. ``We really
have a good band. For the first time, every member of the group is
exactly right. Everything just clicked this time.''
   It wasn't always that easy. Becoming an overnight sensation took
a long time.
   It started in the Polish industrial city of Jaworzno, where
Basia grew up listening to Western music, everything from Charlie
Parker to Prince, with Pink Floyd and Carole King on the side.
   She started singing with an all-girl group while still in her
teens, and left for London in 1981 to make a serious stab at a
musical career. Her leaving, she says, allowed her to experience
only from afar much of the economic and political turmoil her
countrymen went through in the 1980s.
   ``I left just before martial law got introduced,'' she said in a
voice that now contains a strong English accent.
   ``Before that, my life (in Poland) was pretty carefree and
careless. I remember that nothing really was missing in my life. We
had enough to eat, we were comfortable. My parents had their own
business producing ice cream. . . . I had my music and my friends.''
   She incorporated everything she heard into her own upbeat style,
one that's heavy on jazz, pop, Latin rhythms and American rhythm
and blues.
   And just after her arrival in London, she met longtime
collaborator Danny White whose musical interests were equally
broad. By the mid-1980s, the two decided it was time to strike out
on their own. But that wasn't easy either.
   ``Danny kept encouraging me to write,'' she said. ``He would
give me a verse and I had to finish the rest of the song.'' It was
something she hated.
   ``To shut him up, I finally just did it, and we wrote a whole
album that way.''
   The album was ``Time and Tide.'' It was her first and quickly
sold 100,000 copies after its 1987 release. The record company was
delighted, but she was disappointed because she was hoping for a
gold record (for 500,000 copies sold). But the LP just kept on
selling, going gold in 1988 and platinum (for 1 million albums
sold) the following year.
   Then everything exploded. ``London-Warsaw-New York'' came out
earlier this year and zoomed up the charts, going gold in three
weeks. The small club dates from the last American tour quickly
became huge concert-hall events. Following this summer's U.S. tour,
there will be concerts in Japan. Then it's back to the United
States in the fall for more shows.
   The success has made her one of Poland's biggest stars.
   ``Now, when I tell my mum something, she's already seen it in
the interview,'' she quipped.
   But her mother hasn't seen her perform in front of thousands
yet. She's only seen her daughter's videos. So there will soon be a
series of concerts in Poland, too.
   ``This is something that is very much on my mind, it's important
to me,'' Basia said. Family also is important, and she returns home
several times a year. ``When I'm there I get so sentimental and
soppy that I just want to cry.''
   In fact, if success has a downside it is that it has kept her
from starting her own family.
   ``This is something I miss the most,'' she said. ``I envy people
who have a stable family life. Career, it's one thing. But it's
nothing compared to that. I really want it badly, and sometimes I'm
afraid I won't get it. I didn't meet the right person yet, I'm
afraid.
   ``But I'm still keeping my eyes open,'' she adds, turning upbeat
again.
