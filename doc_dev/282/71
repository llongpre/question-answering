<LEADPARA>  'THE Commitments." The title of this birth-of-a-band saga sounds like a
remnant of the counterculture '60s. The film that comes with it doesn't
disappoint. It's self-important, cluttered, old-fashioned, like a parody of
England's better "kitchen sink" dramas ("The Loneliness of the Long-Distance
Runner," "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning").;    It's the kind of film we've
come to expect of Alan Parker, who specializes in glossy grit and glib
outrage. Parker's past titles read like an honor roll of sophomoric,
anti-establishment tirades: "Midnight Express." "Birdy." "Mississippi
Burning." "Pink Floyd The Wall." "Come See the Paradise."  </LEADPARA>

REVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Well-meaning and "committed" to a fault, Parker has this knack for
trivializing whatever he touches. The problem is Parker has little to say --
apart from regimentation and reactionary politics can be dangerous to your
health.;    And so it is again with "The Commitments," which opens today in
San Francisco (no San Jose opening date has been set) and finds the British
film maker taking a breather from his lectures on American civil-liberty
abuses.;    The setting is the sooty back alleys of industrial Dublin. It's
here that Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) vows to form and manage his own blues
band because, like, man, the blues are the lament of the downtrodden and
disenfranchised and "the Irish are the blacks of Europe . . . and the South
Dubliners are the blacks of Dublin.";    In a vaguely amusing montage, Jimmy
holds auditions in his parents' cramped rowhouse. "Rednecks and Southsiders
need not apply," his ad reads. Still, the backyard rockers, skinheads and
Sinead O'Connors flock to the tryouts. Jimmy's father mocks the processional
in his own fashion: by crooning a fairly decent impression of Elvis Presley on
"Can't Help Falling in Love.";    All spunk and determination, Jimmy pieces
together a band with potential. Deco (Andrew Strong) is the group's Otis
Redding, Wilson Pickett and Percy Sledge rolled into one. Imelda (Angeline
Ball), hired more for her pulchritude than vocal range, is one of the three
Commitment-ettes. Steven (pianist Michael Aherne), Billy (drummer Dick
Massey), Derek (guitarist Ken McCluskey), Dean (saxophonist Felim Gormley),
Outspan (guitarist Glen Hansard) and Billy (drummer Dick Massey) are the
backup musicians.;    The real leader, however, is veteran blues trumpeter
Joey "the Lips" Fagan (non-musician Johnny Murphy), who lives with his elderly
mother and regales his young friends with stories of stateside sessions with
B.B. King, Redding and other blues legends.;    Parker's quasi-documentary,
quasi-Richard ("Hard Day's Night") Lester romp follows the group from their
grim first rehearsals to their church-sponsored debut to their first paying
gigs.;    The not-so-subtle irony: As the group becomes tighter on stage,
really begins to cook on such R &amp; B standards as "Mustang Sally" and "In the
Midnight Hour," the fallings-out backstage become more bitter. Singer Bernie
(Bronagh Gallagher) has siblings to baby-sit and can never make rehearsals on
time; Imelda has an uptight fiance; the deceptively laid-back Joey has his
libido to rein in; Deco, a lecherous slob, has this special talent for
estranging one and all.;    So, on the eve of the Commitments' arrival -- and
a possible surprise visit by "the man" himself, Wilson Pickett -- the band is
on the brink of self-destruction.;    I suppose this is all meant as a
metaphor for Ireland's "troubles." The band, for all its natural talent, is,
like Ireland, unable to reconcile its warring factions.;    Unfortunately,
"The Commitments" fails to click as either political allegory or backstage
fable. Parker is to be applauded for returning to the street to find his
"World's Hardest Working Band" (the ensemble was pieced together from an open
casting call), but he goes on to shoot himself in the foot by having his
non-actors deliver the kind of contrived, politically correct speeches that
would have drawn hoots 20 years ago.;    "The Commitments," based on the Roddy
Doyle book and so rich in slang as to warrant subtitles, is best when it shuts
up and just wails. The 16-year-old (!) Strong as Deco is brilliant on "Take Me
to the River" and "Try a Little Tenderness." No one seems to have told him he
was fronting for the MTV version of Joyce's "Dubliners.";     The Commitments;
