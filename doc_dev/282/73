   Stay out of the music scene for four years
and look what happens.
   British soul stylist Paul Young can tell you all about it. After
his third album, ``Between Two Fires,'' ran its course in 1986, he
slowed down to start a family. He then took two more years to put
together his latest album, ``Other Voices.''
   While he was gone, the Motown sound returned to the charts with
blue-eyed soul singers and fellow Brits at the helm: George
Michael, Simply Red and Lisa Stansfield. Young returned just in
time.
   ``People could say I've been away long enough to be forgotten,''
he said in an interview. ``In some territories, it is long enough
to be forgotten, but in other territories, it's been a break, and
that's not such a bad thing.''
   Young began ``Other Voices'' with the same staff he had used on
his three previous albums, but was unsatisfied with the results.
Six months' work, as he said, went ``down the pan.''
   So he started anew. He brought in plenty of guest musicians _
Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on guitar, singer Chaka Khan on backing
vocals and Stevie Wonder on harmonica. Nile Rodgers produced a
track, and two more were done with former J. Geils Band leader
Peter Wolf.
   But Young still felt he had to get back to his roots in Britain
and did some recording there as well.
   ``Working with Peter, I was coming up with music that was very
different from what I'd done before, much more American,'' he said.
``My biggest audience is in Europe and I can't ignore that.''
   ``Other Voices'' is filled with material by other artists,
including covers of the Chi-Lites' ``Oh Girl'' and Free's ``A
Little Bit of Love.'' Young sees doing these songs as a way of
distancing himself from his own material.
   ``I'd like to forget that I wrote them and approach them as an
arranger and then I could probably enjoy it more,'' he said. ``But
underneath it, there's always my song and so I see it one
particular way. That somehow stops me from doing certain things.
   ``With other songs, I've heard them one way, I see them another
way, so straightaway, I've got this choice of things I can do with
it and I think that makes it more enjoyable.''
   He also sees doing covers as a way to keep great old songs
alive, but likes to look for the less well-known standards.
   ``I tend to prefer finding songs that are little gems in the
dust, as it were, and making them out to be something special,
because maybe they (the audience) missed it the first time
'round,'' he said.
   ``I don't like a lot of music that loses track of its roots. I
hope that what I'm doing when I do these things is keeping the old
stuff in their minds, but keeping up to date in terms of how I work
the arrangements, what instruments I use, stuff like that.''
   On ``Other Voices,'' Young said he went back to ``playing a lot
of stuff live again and not using too much machinery. I think the
trick is to use the machinery but still make it sound very human.''
   Songwriting is not his forte, he said, but he's looking to
change that.
   ``I think I was working with a guy who also found it very hard
to be a songwriter and that made it even more difficult,'' he said.
``So now I've made some contacts with people who actually enjoy the
process of being stuck in a room for eight hours, which I don't
find in the least bit inviting.''
   Young's solo career began in 1982 after 3{ years with the soul
outfit the Q-Tips. His first break came in 1983 with a version of
the Marvin Gaye classic, ``Wherever I Lay My Hat,'' which stayed at
No. 1 in England for three weeks. His debut album, ``No Parlez,''
also reached the top of the charts there.
   His long-awaited U.S. success came with the Top 20 song, ``Come
Back and Stay,'' also from ``No Parlez.'' But his second album,
``The Secret of Association,'' released in 1985, contained his
first U.S. No. 1 hit _ ``Everytime You Go Away,'' written by Daryl
Hall of Hall and Oates.
   He doesn't necessarily see ``Other Voices'' as a progression,
but rather a beginning of new things.
   ``I think I've now built myself another little base to work
from,'' he said. ``It's a pretty good mixture of what the last
three albums had done and it's now on one album. There's quite a
few indications of ways I could go.''
