   It was the year when the arts moved from the entertainment pages
to the front pages, where issues of censorship and artistic freedom
were debated in communities across the country.
   In Cincinnati, a museum curator was acquitted of obscenity
charges for displaying the late Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs.
In Florida, the rap group 2 Live Crew also was exonerated after
being arrested for performing their obscenity-laden songs.
   But other targets got no relief: Novelist Salman Rushdie
remained in hiding in Britain, eluding the ``death sentence''
ordered by Iran's censorious Islamic fundamentalists.
   In 1990, a century after his death, Vincent van Gogh was the
world's most popular artist. His ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' sold at
auction for a record $82.5 million.
   The priceless Van Goghs were genuine, but some fakes - Milli
Vanilli - made just as much news.
   It also was the year in which a platoon of rockers, including
Cyndi Lauper, Sinead O'Connor and Joni Mitchell, showed up at the
Berlin Wall to perform, before 200,000 people, songs from Pink
Floyd's 1979 rock epic ``The Wall.''
   And it was year Bart Simpson came to life on millions of
American TV screens.
   Here are the best and worst of 1990, as judged by the
entertainment and arts writers of The Associated Press:

   LIVING COLOUR
   At the vanguard of black-based rock bands. Excellent lyrics, and
hot guitar playing by Vernon Reid. Cross-over without compromise.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Worst</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   2 LIVE CREW
   Dirty lyrics are the only thing Luther Campbell and company have
going for them. Bad singing, lack of creativity, lack of talent and
contempt for women are not punishable offenses. Too bad.
   VANILLA ICE
   Every era has its teen idols, but few are as cynical. Ice steals
moves from MC Hammer and grooves from Queen and David Bowie. He
tries to keep his identity a secret, then it turns out he's been
lying about his background. Now all he has to prove is that that's
his voice on ``Ice Ice Baby.''

   GOODFELLAS
   Working with familiar actors (Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci), using
familiar music (rock from the '60s and '70s) and covering familiar
territory (the streets of New York), Martin Scorsese turns out the
freshest gangster film in years. Ray Liotta stars as mobster Henry
Hill, but sidekick Pesci steals this movie, wearing a toupee that
would make Howard Cosell blush, and laughing and shooting his way
through a performance both hilarious and terrifying.

   JESUS OF MONTREAL
   Intelligent, passionate, audacious, witty.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Worst</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE
   Starring Andrew Dice Clay, a movie that never should have been
made.

<HEAD>TELEVISION</HEAD>
<HEAD>Best</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THE CIVIL WAR, PBS
   A magnificent tapestry of the most bloody and brutal war in our
history.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Worst</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TWIN PEAKS, ABC
   Long on silly pretense and forced style, short on substance.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THEATER</HEAD>
<HEAD>Best Play of the Year</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION
   By John Guare, easily the most imaginative writing of the year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Best Musical of the Year</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ONCE ON THIS ISLAND
   Sweet, simple and altogether beguiling. A promising Broadway
debut by a new songwriting team - Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Worst Play of the Year</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MONEY TALKS
   No, it doesn't. A true vanity production written by a financial
securities adviser named Edwin Schloss. And you wonder why the
economy is in trouble. The saddest part of the production was the
casting of two wonderful musical comedy stars, Dolores Gray and
Helen Gallagher, in the leads.

<HEAD>Worst Musical of the Year</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SHOGUN, THE MUSICAL
   Big, bloated and boring, despite a shipwreck, earthquake and
some gorgeous costumes by Patricia Zipprodt. A numbing spectacle
with the most unmemorable melodies on Broadway. Where is Andrew
Lloyd Webber when you really need him?
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NOVELS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Best</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PHILADELPHIA FIRE
   By John Edgar Wideman, a complex metaphor for urban America,
burning with poetry.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Worst</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THE STAND
   By Stephen King, easily his best work when first published years
ago. Now in a revised and expanded edition, it is a windy and
egotistical exercise by a writer who seemingly still thinks he gets
paid by the word - and any word will do.
