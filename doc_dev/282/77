   Thirteen of the biggest names in rock music have
recorded a remake of the Deep Purple classic ``Smoke on the Water''
to raise money for victims of the earthquake that devastated parts
of Soviet Armenia last year.
   The group, known as Rock Aid Armenia, launched the single at a
news conference Wednesday and said they hope to raise $1.6 million
from the single, an album and video. The single will be released on
Nov. 27.
   The all-star line-up includes Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore,
formerly of Deep Purple, Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd, Bruce
Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Keith Emerson of Emerson Lake and Palmer,
and Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen.
   Sitting beneath two moving logos of the charity Life Aid Armenia
and a black and white photo of an earthquake victim lying in
rubble, Gillan explained they were not looking for halos.
   ``We had a great time doing the record and we hope it's going to
do some good for the people of Armenia.
   ```Smoke on the Water' is ideal for something like this. It's a
song that was born out of disaster and ended up being a triumph,''
he said, explaining that the original was inspired by a lakeside
fire in Switzerland where Deep Purple were recording.
   Gillan and Tony Iommi, from Black Sabbath, are planning separate
trips to the Soviet Union and hope to visit Armenia.
   An album and a video made for Rock Aid Armenia will be released
Dec. 8. They feature additional classic tracks including songs from
Asia, Bon Jovi, Led Zeppelin, Foreigner, Mike and the Mechanics,
Genesis, Rush, Yes and The Quire Boys.
   The stars provided their services free and have promised every
penny raised from the worldwide sales will go to charities working
in Armenia. They estimate they have already secured advance sales
of more than 250,000 dollars.
   The Armenian earthquake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter
Scale, struck on Dec. 7, killing more than 25,000 people, leaving
500,000 homeless and 50 towns and cities flattened.
