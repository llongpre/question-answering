   It wasn't a minute after the gavel fell on the
Democratic National Convention that delegates began scrambling for
souvenirs, barely ahead of the demolition crew hired to haul the $1
million podium off to the dump.
   Some delegates, like Sharon Mast, a school teacher from
Bellevue, Wash., even coveted the confetti that had rained down on
her head a few moments earlier.
   ``This isn't confetti at all,'' said the Dukakis delegate as she
scooped up a handful of the tiny, red, blue and silver pieces into
an envelope. ``This is magic fairy dust that will help us defeat
Bush this fall. It really won't take very much.''
   Hundreds of the 5,000 delegates and alternates in The Omni left
the coliseum carrying bags bulging with prizes they had picked up.
Some had bunches of balloons; others waved large aluminum and
cardboard replicas of the Greek flag.
   Alvin Chambliss Jr., a Jackson delegate from Oxford, Miss.,
walked out clutching his ``Bentsen No'' sign. ``There's no way I'm
going to leave this behind,'' he said.
   Some delegates were still searching for souvenirs when the first
members of the breakdown crew arrived, 30 minutes after the
convention's close.
   ``Now the fun begins,'' said Frank Taylor, one of several AT&amp;T
technicians who were dismantling the computer voting terminals
scattered about the convention floor.
   Soon, a small army of laborers and technicians was pulling down
the light and sound systems, stacking chairs, ripping up the carpet
and using crowbars on the $1 million moveable podium from which
Democratic nominee Dukakis had addressed the delegates just an hour
before.
   ``We'll salvage the elevator and some of the other parts, then
we'll haul the rest off to the landfill,'' said William ``Pug''
Mabry, a general superintendent for Flagler Construction Co., which
helped construct the convention set.
   He said the work crews had 12 hours to remove the chairs, rip up
the carpet and temporary floor beneath it and then take out 50
miles of cables beneath the floor.
   ``In 12 hours there will be cranes in here, pulling down the TV
network anchor booths, which then will be taken to New Orleans for
the Republican convention next month.''
   In addition to the cable beneath the floor, the sound and
lighting crew had to remove some 500 lights and 15 miles of cable
above the floor.
   ``I know that sounds like a lot, but we had even more lights up
there for the Pink Floyd concert here a couple of months ago,''
said Chuck Adams, a spotlight technician.
   Mike Oshust, director of operations for The Omni coliseum, said
the work crews, in addition to removing 2,000 portable chairs, also
had to reinstall 5,500 fixed seats that were removed so the
Democrats could install their huge pink, blue and gray podium.
   ``It took us six weeks to put up the podium but we'll have it
completely torn down within eight days,'' he said.
   ``We've got to work fast because we've got another show coming
in on the 29th.''
