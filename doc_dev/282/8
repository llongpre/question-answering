   The British rock group Pink Floyd is planning
to stage an $8 million concert extravaganza based on its album
``The Wall'' in Berlin, where else, next to the Wall.
   The performance, set for July 21 at Patzdamer Platz near the
site of the Brandenburg Gate, will feature the construction and
demolition of a 80-foot-tall, 600-foot-long wall.
   The concert will launch a five-year campaign to raise $800
million for the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief, said founding
member Roger Waters.
   ``I want Russians, Germans, Americans building the wall and
tearing it down, as a symbolic act of collaboration and the aims of
the Memorial Fund,'' Waters said by telephone from London.
   The group wants to get ``the armed forces freed to do disaster
relief work when they have time off from training or polishing
their boots,'' Waters said.
   The movie version of ``The Wall,'' a story of a troubled rock
star, was released in 1979 and is based on the band's album. Some
19 million albums were sold worldwide.
   Due to join Waters on stage in Berlin are Sinead O'Connor, Van
Morrison, Thomas Dolby, The Band, Bryan Adams, The Scorpions, the
East Berlin Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra, and the East Berlin Radio
Choir.
