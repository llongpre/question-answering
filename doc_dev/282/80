<TEXT>  Vol. 2"; (Antone's Records and Tapes); (star)(star)(star)(star);   This isn't
just gravy; there's still plenty of meat on them ribs. Every year a bunch of
the best in the blues world make Austin, Texas, the place to be for a week, a
big party for and with the guys who made Antone's the best blues club in the
second-largest state in the union. This album is culled from that wonderful
extravaganza.;    Jimmy Rogers, Pinetop Perkins, Calvin Jones, Buddy Guy, Otis
Rush, Snooky Pryor, James Cotton, Albert Collins, Lazy Lester, Matt "Guitar"
Murphy, Hubert Sumlin and a bunch of other solid music masters make this album
a must for blues fans.;    Backed by the hard-working Antone's house band and
some other folks dropping in, these guys work through some classic and
beautiful tunes. Rogers' "Chicago Bound" and "Sloppy Drunk," Walter Jacobs'
"Everything is Going to Be Alright" (with Guy howling like a dog in an alley),
Albert King's "Natural Ball" and Chester "Howlin' Wolf" Burnett's "Moanin' at
Midnight" are blues as pure and deep as it comes.;    Cotton and Sumlin pair
up for a tribute to Howlin' Wolf that is an impressive demonstration of how
much blues the right musicians can squeeze out of just one guitar and a
harmonica -- with the help of Cotton's voice at its most soulful.;    There's
a range of stuff here, ranging from folk blues to urban howls to a zydeco
zinger, "The Same Thing Could Happen to You." And it was all recorded live, in
a great nightclub, the way it's supposed to be.; -- John Orr;  Pop;
BANANARAMA; "Pop Life"; (London; CD, cassette); (star);  This minor disc
should be of interest to aerobics instructors, aging disco dollies and few
others. Bubblegum styles have always had a shelf life roughly equivalent to
that of a teen's tenure in high school. And this ditzy trio -- which proudly
bills itself as "the U.K.'s most successful female combo ever" -- is certainly
not immune from the vagaries of time.;    This weak and dated effort sounds
like the death knell for one of the longest-running dance-pop troikas in the
post-new-wave age. Bananarama's early hits ("Robert De Niro's Waiting" and
"Venus" in particular) had a certain carefree "airheaded-and-proud-of-it"
insolence that made them very seductive.;    But nobody will be seduced by
this patched-together set of tired synthesizer beats. Their brazen borrowing
from Eurythmics ("Preacher Man") and the Rolling Stones ("Only Your Love")
won't earn them any awards for originality. If they were going to steal licks
they could at least show some creativity in their choice of victims.;    The
disco cover of the Doobie Brothers' "Long Train Running" should have Doobie
Tom Johnston tearing out his hair and asking God what he ever did to deserve
such a fate. However, this disc is not entirely without merit: The monotonous,
steady droning of the synthesizers is the perfect companion to a Stairmaster
or rowing machine workout.;    -- David Plotnikoff;  JULIAN COPE; "Peggy
Suicide"; (Island Records; all formats); (star)(star)(star)(star);  A lot of
people who haven't heard of Julian Cope probably should with the release of
his latest collection of biting rock 'n' roll, a double album that will end up
on a lot of critics' top 10 lists.;    "Peggy Suicide" does what a rock album
should do: It is guitar-centered and refreshing in an age of too many
synthesizers, with some cuts so edgy and hard they were recorded in one take.
It combines the rawness of Neil Young's "Tonight's the Night" with Pink
Floyd's melodic spaciness and the dark lyricism and wit of Lou Reed.;    Cope,
who started out in the English Band "The Teardrop Explodes," may be best known
for a modern music classic, "Charlotte Anne," that was played often on San
Francisco's Live 105.;    His songs are dark, intelligent and have a message
for the '90s. While Young's fast and furious best work dealt with the
destruction brought on by drugs, Cope's deals with the painful damage being
done to Mother Earth -- the "Peggy Suicide" of his title.;    The album is
driven by the intensity of the message, as if Cope were in such a rush to get
it out that he couldn't wade through too many takes. It's the kind of rock we
were brought up with in the '60s -- before the music got lost in a lot of
glossy production.;    Its one failing may be Cope's voice, which is in the
low, sometimes off-key registers of Eric Burdon, Jim Morrison and Lou Reed.
Not one that is easily listened to for a long time.;    But this isn't an
album that is meant to be pleasant. Just vital.;    -- Brad Kava;  Heavy
metal; KING MISSILE; "The Way to Salvation"; (Atlantic; CD, cassette);
(star)(star) 1/2; Don't be put off by the atypical metal-head
phallus-worshipping band name -- this disc should go a long way toward erasing
the border between collegiate underground rock and straight metal.;   
Stylistically, the album is all over the map -- from surf guitar and grunge
guitar to orthodox, pounding metal rhythms and chiming, enigmatic, clearly
enunciated vocals.;    Two back-to-back cuts -- "The Boy Who Ate Lasagna and
Could Jump Over a Church" and "The Story of Willy" -- are darkly humorous,
minimalist tracks that coyly point to a very fertile imagination at work here.
The silly feel-good anthem "I Wish" (in which vocalist John Hall wishes he
could "drink molten lava . . . talk sideways and backwards . . . eat the corn
of joy and sorrow . . . drive the tractor of innocence . . . and drink
chocolate champagne") is like a journey through the daydreams of some scraggly
post-adolescent metal-head who knows he thinks too much to be like all the
rest.; -- D.P.  </TEXT>
