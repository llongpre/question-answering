   Some myths about Kate Bush:
   _The four-year wait for her new album, ``Sensual World,'' was by
choice.
   Bush, a perfectionist in the studio, says no. She did take a
brief rest after issuing the popular greatest hits package, ``The
Whole Story,'' but said creating suitable material caused the
delay. She also changed labels, from EMI to CBS.
   _She doesn't like to perform live.
   Not so, the singer insists. This most visual of artists loves
the stage, but worries about maintaining the intensity night after
night of material such as ``Get Out of my House'' and ``Sat in Your
Lap.'' That's why she hasn't toured in 10 years.
   _Her favorite author is Emily Bronte.
   Wrong again. Yes, the title and story of ``Wuthering Heights,''
a No. 1 single in England in 1978, were taken straight from the
novel. But no, Bush didn't like the book and, in fact, hadn't even
seen the movie.
   It is true, however, that the British star has a few things to
say about love, and a few more about the, well, ``Sensual World.''
All that is no surprise to anyone whose ears have rung from her
operatic passion on ``Wuthering Heights'' or has gazed at those
penetrating brown eyes which glow from her album covers.
   So Bush fans won't be surprised that the title song of her new
record more than lives up to its name.
   A better story is how it came to be recorded. Originally, having
composed an appropriately seductive track, Bush thought of James
Joyce's erotic classic, ``Ulysses,'' and thought she had found the
ideal lyrics.
   ``The lyrics were taken straight from Molly Bloom's soliloquy,''
the 31-year-old singer-songwriter said in a telephone interview
from London. ``The words were so rich, so intimate. It was like
magic the way they fitted.''
   Unfortunately, the Joyce estate had no interest in hearing the
author's words set to music. If Bush wanted to invoke ``Ulysses,''
she'd have to start from scratch. She did, cooing ``Mmh, yes,'' and
murmering images of ``seedcakes'' and ``arrows of love'' while
uilleann pipes and an Irish bagpipe moaned in the background.
   ``I was disappointed,'' Bush admitted, ``and it was very
difficult. I wanted to keep the original sense, but obviously I am
not Joyce. But with the rhythms I had, it began to turn into what
the Molly Bloom character is about. I was stepping out of the song
into the beauty nature.''
   She calls her dreamlike songs ``short stories,'' and brings to
them a fiction writer's fascination with legend and reality. That
means imagining heists with Bogart and Cagney, summoning the spirit
of Houdini and springing from the head of Zeus.
   On ``Heads We're Dancing,'' a young girl meets a charming
stranger at a dance in 1939 and discovers she is conversing with
Hitler.
   ``I was thinking of the devil incarnate, the ultimate evil,''
she said. ``It was inspired by a friend of mine who had been to
this dinner and sat next to this guy and found him absolutely
fascinating, intelligent and well-educated.
   ``He asked the next day, `Who was that?', and was told it was
(atomic bomb developer) J. Robert Oppenheimer. My friend went back
in horror. He said he would have behaved completely differently if
he had realized who it was.''
   Obsession, like Cathy for Heathcliff, drove Bush to make music.
She played piano for hours as a child and was 15 when a friend
introduced her to Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour.
   ``He was looking for different acts and my friend said to him,
`Come and have a listen.' They came down and worked on a few songs
with me. I couldn't afford anything like paying for a studio so
Dave put up the money. We put three tracks down, two of those
tracks went on the first album (`The Kick Inside').''
   Go to a record store and you'll find her albums in the ``pop''
or ``rock'' section, between Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds. But
neither of those 1960s groups had a singer with a four-octave
soprano, or called a song ``Suspended in Gaffa,'' or ever used the
Digeridu or Bouzouki.
   Bush was inspired by British art rockers Peter Gabriel and Bryan
Ferry rather than country and rhythm 'n' blues. Instead of getting
her kicks from electric guitar, Bush fell in love with the
Fairlight synthesizer, which she began using on her third album,
``Never for Ever.''
   ``I took one look at it and said, `This is what I've been
looking for all my life.' I couldn't believe the Fairlight. It's
called a synthesizer, but many of its sounds are of natural source.
To be able to play with strings, waterfalls, anything you want,
it's wonderful.
   ``It was just like opening this great door for me, a complete
revolution. It meant I no longer felt a need to write on the piano
and fill it out with synthesizers.''
   Bush talks of colors, moods. There's the anger of ``Between a
Man and a Woman,'' the loss of innocence of ``The Fog,'' the dry
wit of ``Running Up That Hill (a Deal With God).''
   She also writes of lying awake at night, worrying about love, in
``The Man With the Child in His Eyes,'' and being brought to tears
by a bad dream in ``Cloudbusting.''
   ``All of us tend to live in our heads. In `Cloudbusting,' the
idea was of starting this song with a person waking up from this
dream, `I wake up crying.' It's like setting a scene that
immediately suggests to you that this person is no longer with
someone they dearly love,'' she said.
   ``It puts a pungent note on the song. Life is loss, isn't it?
It's learning to cope with loss. I think in a lot of ways, that's
what all of us have to cope with.''
