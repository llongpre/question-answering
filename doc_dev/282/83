FT  18 OCT 93 / Observer: Wachsing lyrical at VW
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Otto Ferdinand Wachs has at last been awarded the label to accompany the job
he has been doing for the past three months.
Now named as head of public affairs at Volkswagen, Wachs has formally taken
over the role of Lutz Schilling, the ill-fated former group spokesman.
Schilling carries the can for the public relations catastrophes incurred in
the fumbled defence of both the group and production director Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, against accusations from rival carmaker Adam Opel.
It was Schilling who sat at the side of Ferdinand Piech during the gruesome
summer press conference in Wolfsburg, at which the VW chairman's bellicosity
earned him public reproaches from Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Now Schilling will occupy himself with less strenuous matters, such as
corporate identity and motor sports. His toughest immediate task will be
steering next year's VW sponsorship of a European tour by the rock band,
Pink Floyd.
Wachs is former press chief for the VW car marque. His snappy dress and a
penchant for Italian wine bars - both rarities in VW country - have earned
him the soubriquet 'the Wolfsburg yuppie' in some quarters.
But Wachs is one of the few old-guard VW senior managers to survive and be
promoted by Piech. Moreover, during the recent lull in the Opel-Lopez affair
he has guided his fractious boss through a series of image-restoring
interviews.
