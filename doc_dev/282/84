   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd doesn't just slip
quietly into the hospital.
   Twenty rooms of the Cleveland Clinic are being refurbished to
accommodate the 67-year-old monarch, his wives and retinue of 200
when he arrives in a few weeks for a physical and possible knee
surgery, said clinic spokesman Gary Weiland.
   Taste and security are both concerns, the spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The Saudi Embassy in Washington refused to confirm or deny that
the king is headed for the clinic, but Weiland said that Fahd will
come to the hospital during a state visit. The king is scheduled to
meet President Bush on July 27.
   The clinic was picked because of its staff's experience in
orthopedic surgery and because the king's half-brother, Khaled, had
heart surgery there twice, Weiland said. Khaled, who preceded Fahd
as king, died in 1982.

   City officials who tried to block a Pink
Floyd concert for fear the loud music would damage historic
buildings relented Thursday after the British rockers agreed to keep
the volume down.
   Organizers of the weekend concert agreed also to move the
floating stage in the Venice lagoon farther from St. Mark's piazza
than planned, city officials said. The top volume will be cut to 60
decibels from 105 decibels.
   The Jericho scenario was raised by city preservation officials,
who threatened Wednesday to deny permission for the concert.
   The concert Saturday is free, and spectators are expected to
watch from boats, rooftops and the shore.

   Jerry Hall, Mick Jagger's live-in, insists their
children get an occasional look at the wide open spaces she knew
from her childhood in Mesquite.
   The 33-year-old actress and model says she brings 5-year-old
Elizabeth Scarlett Jagger and 3-year-old Leroy Augustine Jagger to
Texas from their home in England five or six times a year.
   Ms. Hall, who has a supporting role in the hit movie ``Batman,''
was in Dallas this week to introduce a line of swimwear she
designed. The children in came along.
   ``It's so nice to be out in wide open spaces with the beautiful
skies, riding horses and having fun,'' Mrs. Hall said. ``In England,
they go to school and they're always confined. ... I also want them
to know part of where I come from. They're part Texan, and I want to
be sure they know it.''
   Mrs. Hall said she was designing a swimsuit in honor of a reunion
tour Jagger and his Rolling Stones bandmates plan in the United
States in September.

   Kirk Douglas settled his lawsuit Thursday against
Sperry Corp., which dropped him as spokesman two years ago when it
merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys Corp.
   The settlement, for an undisclosed amount, occurred as jury
selection was to begin in federal court. ``I am grateful to go back
to the world of make-believe,'' said Douglas, who was accompanied in
court by his wife, Anne.
   Douglas filed a $1.25 million breach of contract suit two years
ago against Sperry and Unisys, claiming termination of the contract
wrecked his chances of getting a similar job with another big
corporation.
   The star of ``Spartacus'' and 70 other movies wouldn't reveal
what he got in the settlement but said he was pleased with the deal.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Alberto Zoppe, who tours the country
with his Zoppe Circus Europa, got his big break when his family
traded him for an elephant.
   Zoppe, a sixth-generation circus performer, was working with his
family circus in Italy in 1947 when the Ringling Brothers Barnum and
Bailey Circus asked him to take his bareback horse-riding act to the
United States.
   His family was struggling after World War II and he didn't want
to leave them shorthanded, so he agreed to leave on one condition _
the American circus had to give his family an elephant.
   ``I knew they had 52 elephants and we didn't have any, so I
didn't want to leave my family without anything,'' the 67-year-old
circus owner said as he prepared for a Friday opening here.
   Forty-two years later, Zoppe, 67, tours with his own family
circus in the United States and Canada.
