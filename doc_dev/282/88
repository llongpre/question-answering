   ``Are we weird?'' guitarist Chris DeGarmo of
Queensryche asks, only slightly kidding.
   No, Queensryche's not weird - it's just that hearts and flowers
are not part of their vocabulary. When they write of love, it's
obsessive and intense. Such topics as homelessness, self-reliance,
the environment and dream control are also more their speed.
   And seriousness is their specialty.
   Critics hailed the Seattle band's 1988 magnum opus,
``Operation:mindcrime,'' as heavy metal's answer to the Who's
``Quadrophenia'' and Pink Floyd's ``The Wall.'' The entire album
concerned an underground organization that preaches the overthrow
of government and the cleaning-up of a corrupt society.
   With their latest effort, ``Empire,'' Queensryche has left
behind a record tied together by a central theme and has instead
turned to individual songs dealing with specific issues. The band
used that formula on their two earlier works, 1986's ``Rage for
Order'' and 1984's ``The Warning.''
   ``The first thing that we wanted to do was not repeat
ourselves,'' DeGarmo said in a telephone interview.
   ``I think the experimentation that the band is always pushed for
is what produced `Operation:mindcrime,' and we felt confident that
if we continued just really trying to not tread water and push our
songwriting out into new areas that we'd come up with something
that we all felt really good about - and something that was
interesting as well.''
   DeGarmo called ``Empire'' a more intimate record.
   ``The last record was pretty cynical - this third person
fictional event that the listener just watched more than anything
or listened to as a spectator,'' he said, ``and this time we just
felt we needed to make a more personal record that had a lot more
`I' language in it.''
   Such songs as ``Della Brown,'' about a homeless woman;
``Resistance,'' about cleaning up the environment; and ``Best I
Can,'' a tale of triumph over adversity, prove that the band hasn't
left behind its social consciousness.
   `` `Della' talks about this media message that seems to come to
young women that if they've got looks, they've got everything,''
DeGarmo said.
   ``She tries to believe that line and never develops her mind,
never develops the person within - and what happens is eventually
that young, beautiful figure and face fades with time and she's
left unhappy.''
   Perhaps the album's most introspective track is the gorgeously
orchestrated ``Silent Lucidity,'' a haunting song about the fine
line between dream and reality and the possibility of controlling
dreams.
   DeGarmo wrote both the music and lyrics of ``Lucidity'' and said
it came from his own experiences with lucid dreaming.
   ``The first time I ever experienced a lucid dream, it kind of
really startled me,'' he said. ``I knew that I was dreaming, and
yet I could actively participate in the dream and shape it.''
   He said the song raises questions about why, if one is dreaming,
do situations seem so real.
   ``How come you can go to sleep and enter this REM state, where
you're having sight and sound information coming to your brain, and
you wake up with the experience of what you've done in your dream?
   ``And then you shake it off and go, `Oh no, it was only a dream
but, geez, it sure felt like I walked through that wall, or like
that I really flew or I had this sexual experience,' or whatever it
was that you had - that's why people wake up so freaked out out of
a nightmare. It scares them so much because it's so real,'' he
said.
   ``Empire'' also contains some of the band's first love songs,
but they're more bitter than sentimental, filled with longing and
charged with sexual energy. The songs also reflect the band's
unwillingness to completely lay bare its soul.
   ``You sort of want to reach in and write something about that
side of you, the side of you that is involved in relationships, but
yet you don't want to share that private space of your life with
everyone, so it becomes very tricky to tread that line,'' he said.
   With ``Empire,'' Queensryche has made still another attempt to
challenge itself. As DeGarmo said, they're also trying to ``keep
the predictability factor'' low and the ``goosebump ratio'' high.
   ``We kind of have this feeling that (the audience is) really
into the fact that they never quite know what's going to be on the
next Queensryche release,'' he said, ``and that they're just
willing to go along with our experimentation.
   ``I think once they get in ... they just fall further into the
abyss until they're stuck inside our records, finding new things
each time they go through them.''
   Singer Geoff Tate provides the band's trademark soaring,
operatic vocals and most of its gritty lyrics. Queensryche holds
onto an older trend in heavy metal with its two guitarists, DeGarmo
and Michael Wilton, both of whom share lead and rhythm chores
relatively equally. Bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott
Rockenfield round out the band.
   DeGarmo thought that Queensryche musically has come a long way
since its start seven years ago.
   ``From a melodic standpoint, I think we're ... trying to make
songs that are a little stickier. I think the lyrics are much more
concrete now than they were in the past, and musically, the
goosebump ratio is getting higher.''
