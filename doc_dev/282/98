They call the limousine trade a service business, which means that on any given 
day a limousine driver may be asked to paint his car purple and cruise the city 
dodging teen-agers who are trying to smooch his right fender. 
</P>
<P>
That job was given to Fleetwood Limousine Ltd. a couple of years ago when pop 
star Prince wanted to lease a limo for three months to publicize his "Purple 
Rain" album. When fans couldn't get through the tinted windows to Prince, "they 
figured kissing the car was the next best thing," says Alan Shanedling, 
president of the Westwood firm. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodating the wildest of whims is all in a day's work for the 600 or so 
companies of Southern California's thriving limousine industry. To earn their 
customary $35 to $60 a hour, drivers must transport their passengers, swaddle 
them in luxury and fulfill whatever curious desires may seize them. 
</P>
<P>
With its entertainment industry, weather and love of conspicuous 
self-indulgence, Southern California has always been a hospitable environment 
for the long sedan. But while it's an easy business to enter, operators say 
it's also easy to go bust, particularly if you can't satisfy customers' 
exacting demands for service. 
</P>
<P>
And customers will ask for almost anything. A client of Afflair Wide Body 
Limousine Service once showed up with a bearskin rug and an overflowing 
champagne bucket and asked sheepishly whether the partition behind the 
chauffeur would guarantee the passengers' privacy. The customer's plan, it 
turned out, was to recreate a torrid love scene that took place in a limousine 
in the movie "No Way Out." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we'll do anything the customer asks, so long as it isn't illegal," 
says Jim Phillips, owner of the Brea company, who had no objection to what the 
customer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Event Dictates Color 
</P>
<P>
A driver for Dreams Unlimited Limousine Service in Los Alamitos was once paid 
to propose marriage to a woman. On instructions from her fiance, the driver met 
the woman at work, read a romantic poem of proposal and spirited her to the 
airport, where she flew to San Francisco for an evening with her future 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Another Dreams Unlimited customer paid to have a limousine carry her boyfriend 
around Southern California on an elaborate treasure hunt. She kept the hunt 
going for eight hours with a series of clues that led to destinations where the 
boyfriend found gifts and other clues. 
</P>
<P>
White may be the color of choice for limousines in Southern California, but 
some occasions bring a run in requests for other colors. If the Dodgers are in 
the playoffs or World Series, there will be a run on requests for royal blue 
sedans; concerts by the rock group Pink Floyd inevitably bring a flurry of 
orders for pink. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the limousine operators' earnings come from ferrying customers to 
airports, handling corporate traffic and special events. The most important of 
those occasions are proms, weddings, bar mitzvahs and funerals. 
</P>
<P>
The prom season is the biggest money maker for most small operators, a time 
when some can jack up their rates to $125 an hour because demand far outstrips 
the supply of cars. More typically, for an eight-passenger car an operator will 
charge $65 an hour, with an eight-hour minimum and a required 15% tip. 
</P>
<P>
But earning this premium fee requires hard work and much diplomacy. Drivers 
often get caught in the middle between parents, who want the drivers to act as 
chaperons, and the teens, who want them to look the other way as they go 
drinking, hang out of the limo's sun roof and generally make the night as wild 
as they have dreamed it would be. 
</P>
<P>
While most teens follow the rules, operators tell horror stories of how 
youthful high spirits brought them ripped seat covers, broken TVs, scratched 
finishes and run-ins with the police. In popular prom-night cruising terrain, 
such as Newport Beach, police set up roadway checkpoints to keep an eye on the 
limousines and other traffic. 
</P>
<P>
For the operator, "it's the best night of the year, and the worst night," said 
Marshall Clayton, owner of Dreams Unlimited Limousines. 
</P>
<P>
The one- and two-car operators who are often so dependent on prom night make up 
most of the industry in Southern California. Only half a dozen limousine 
companies in the area have more than 20 cars, estimates Fleetwood's Shanedling, 
who is vice president of the Limousine Owners Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The history of Clayton's business says a lot about the risks of the enterprise. 
In the 4 1/2 years since he founded Dreams Unlimited, he has bought out small 
limousine companies named Windsor, Caberet, Affluent and Unique. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people get into the business thinking they can count on their friends 
to give them business," Clayton said. "They find out all their friends want it 
for free." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Overhead 
</P>
<P>
The operators also quickly find out about the heavy expenses that they must 
carry if they want to operate legally. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to prices that now run about $40,000 to $60,000 for a new Lincoln 
Town Car or Cadillac stretch limousine, insurance can cost $8,000 to $10,000 
per car each year. Public Utilities Commission licensing fees run 0.75% of an 
operator's gross. 
</P>
<P>
"Put this stuff together, and it's a killer," said Harold Berkman, president of 
Music Express of Burbank, which specializes in show business clientele. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of operators simply don't pay those costs, a maneuver that 
allows them to charge $4 to $8 less an hour than legal competitors, according 
to Shanedling. Such "bandit" drivers are understandably a major gripe of legal 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Los Angeles City Attorney James K. Hahn, in a campaign against 
illegal limousines, sued four companies for failing to have insurance and 
licenses, and other violations. Three have agreed to pay fines to settle the 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
Also important for the business are the show business awards ceremonies, 
including the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys. The Oscars, for example, provide an 
evening's work for about 800 limousines; by comparison, President Bush's 
inauguration fielded 150 limousines. 
</P>
<P>
But these glamorous occasions are also a source of frustration for many small 
operators, since the movie studios use their leverage as big customers to drive 
down rates for the limos that will carry their biggest stars. 
</P>
<P>
"My observation is, sometimes the biggest stars ride around in the crummiest 
looking cars," sniffed operator Phillips.
