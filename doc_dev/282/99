FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: New team faces old problems - Off the Wall

The Arts Council's new team of Lord Gowrie, chairman, and Mary Allen,
secretary general, went on show this week and found itself facing the same
old problems: inadequate funding and the intractable question about
orchestras.
With the government committed to reducing its grant to the council by around
Pounds 25m in real terms over the next four years, money remains the
paramount problem. The council will lobby hard for more cash, but knows that
the opening of the National Lottery floodgate next January could,
ironically, scupper its chances.
The council will have the task of channelling around Pounds 10m a month of
lottery revenue into building projects for arts companies. Treasury
ministers reckon that this must improve the ability of these companies to
boost their incomes, and they will turn a deaf ear to pleas for more annual
subsidy.
Mary Allen seems to favour fewer, but better funded, Arts Council clients.
But she promised this week a 'steady as we go' policy, with plenty of notice
for clients who face a chop in their grants. These could well include
orchestras, although no announcement is likely until December when the
current review of musical life in the provinces, undertaken with the BBC,
reaches its conclusion.
In the meantime the council must find a new music director to replace Ken
Baird, just one of the victims of the council's ill-conceived attempt to cut
London orchestras. Favourite is Anthony Sargent, who currently supervises
the generous arts and music budget of Birmingham Council.
Is rock and roll a dying art? Given that most of the money-making rock
artists are now aged around 50, why should not rock, like the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood in art and fin de siecle decadent poetry in literature, be an
art form that has run its natural course?
The fact that those old Krakens, the Rolling Stones, are heaving themselves
together for one more tour of the American stadia this summer seems to
confirm the fact. They are revivalists of a moribund musical form, like Pink
Floyd and the Eagles, now also both playing the US.
The clincher is the question: which pop stars under 30 could currently fill
Wembley Stadium? None. In fact no pop concerts are planned there this
summer. An era seems to have passed. The American giants - Springsteen,
Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson (none under 30) - who could take on Wembley
are staying at home: perhaps they are doubtful of their pulling power.
This is bad news for Wembley, which can make Pounds 3m a concert. Also bad
news is that Sony, the entertainment conglomerate, is pouring money into an
alternative rock venue, the Milton Keynes Bowl, which it part owns. Not
surprisingly it now books its stars, like Springsteen in 1993, there rather
than the Stadium.
The die is cast. The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, has committed itself
to closing in 1997 for essential re-building work which will, in four years,
bring its backstage facilities from the 19th to the 21st century.
By an odd coincidence English National Opera at the Coliseum also expects to
close in the summer of 1997 for a Pounds 30m facelift. Both companies want
to take advantage of the lottery money that will be splashing around then,
although Covent Garden is eyeing the Millennium Fund while ENO fancies the
cash distributed through the Arts Council.
Opera lovers need not despair. Both companies have hit upon the nearby
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as their temporary home and there are already
discussions revolving round the ENO popping in for a year, and the Opera
House filling it for the remainder of its three years in the wilderness. The
problem has been the rental asked by owners Stoll-Moss, and what to do with
the current production there, Miss Saigon.
But suddenly there is a new player in the game. Apollo Leisure looks likely
to acquire the derelict Lyceum, almost opposite Drury Lane. For around
Pounds 7m, it is suggested, the theatre could be restored to its late-19th
century glory and could become an effective 2,000 plus seater which would
suit Covent Garden very well. Or it could house any musical displaced from
Drury Lane by the opera companies. The glimmerings of a deal are forming,
and one in which the revitalised Arts Council is playing an active role.
