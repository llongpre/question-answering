   Giving grief a name and a face, that is the task of the Names Project, a monumental patchwork quilt unfurled Sunday on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. 
The giant quilt lists Reggie, Michael and Baby Jessica. 
Stitched into it are dates, words of celebration or farewell and even personal effects. 

   The quilt was displayed not far from the granite serpentine wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, with which it inevitably will be compared. 
The stone took many years and a national effort to complete. 
The quilt is basically the brainchild of two San Francisco men, Cleve Jones, a longtime homosexual activist, and Mike Smith, a Stanford University MBA and management consultant. 
Mr. Jones had the idea and made others believe in it. 
Mr. Smith managed the project and found its funds. 
Together, Messrs. 
Smith and Jones solicited three-by-six-foot panels from 300 organizations, including parents' groups, gay bookstores and social services groups. 
They cadged 10 sewing machines to stitch together 1,920 panels representing 2,100 AIDS victims. 
An additional 1,000 panels remain warehoused in San Francisco, finished too late for the Washington unfurling, but ready to be pieced into the quilt by spring, when the quilt begins a national tour to raise funds for AIDS hospices. 

   Although it is devoted to death, the huge quilt is more joyful than morbid. 
The size of a city block, it's been patched together with sidewalk-sized strips of canvas so that viewers can walk over its vast breadth and see the individual patches up close, take in the colors and read the messages from the survivors to the country's dead. 

   One patch simply says "Adios." 
Another reads: "Stephen F. Gaskill -- Over the Rainbow -- 10/12/52-6/17/85." 
Still another says: "He could tan better than anyone I ever knew." 

   Some of the fallen were famous. 
A Los Angeles costumer submitted a gold lame panel studded with rhinestones on behalf of Liberace. 
Broadway's Michael Bennett, creator of "A Chorus Line," is there in a black-and-white cartoon. 

   There also are patches from groups not usually identified with gay causes, who have nonetheless honored members lost to AIDS. 
Among them: a San Francisco chapter of the Lions Club, and Flying Tiger, the macho air-freight line famous for its government contract work in wartime. 

   Then there are the Everyman patches, stitched by family members, friends and lovers of the dead. 
My favorite proclaims: "Reggie Hightower Forever," against a patchwork of shirts, and shows a black hand signing the deaf symbol for "I love you." 
It was made by Art Peterson Jr. of Atlanta on behalf of his companion of 3 1/2 years, who was black and deaf. 

   Sydney and Jim Soons, homosexual brothers from Princeton, N.J., were commemorated in an early American red floral border quilt by their mother, Julia C. Soons, who wrote: "I have two more gay sons. 
I live in fear." 

   A baseball jersey, a baby blanket, a transvestite's frock -- all are among the personal effects sewn into the patches. 
Mixed in with them are fantastic fabric landscapes with applique lilies, palm trees and several maps of Texas. 
Star maps and seascapes deck the squares, as do pianos and peace symbols. 
Calico, flannel and denim are the artists' media, along with satin, velvet, lame and leather. 

   Recently, as celebrities, politicians and patients prepared to read a roll call of names here, about 130 volunteers were folding up the quilt like a mammoth textile lotus for shipment to Washington. 
Mr. Smith, red-faced and exhausted, rehearsed his troops for a dawn-to-dusk showing that he hoped would be "moving and beautiful, not a rock concert."
