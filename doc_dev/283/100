   Nearly 200,000 AIDS cases have been reported
worldwide to the World Health Organization, the U.N. agency said
Friday in a report published to coincide with World AIDS Day.
   The WHO report covers only people diagnosed as having the
disease. The number of notified cases seriously underestimates the
true extent of the problem as many cases, especially in Africa, go
unreported. The WHO report also does not include people infected by
the HIV virus who have not developed the disease itself.
   WHO headquarters in Geneva were draped on Friday with patchwork
quilts bearing names and mementos of AIDS victims, including ``Baby
Jessica,'' as a poignant reminder of the global tragedy.
   WHO said in its AIDS Update that 11,000 new victims of the
deadly disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, were
registered by the end of last month, bringing the total number of
cases to 198,165.
   The United States reported 3,025 of the new cases, raising its
mid-November total to 110,333, about 56 percent of the world total.
The United States has recorded 18,043 new victims so far this year,
according to the WHO report.
   Updated figures from France brought the total of cases there to
8,025, the second highest behind the United States. Brazil has
reported 7,787 cases and Uganda, which has not revised its
statistics since April, 7,375 cases.
   Bermuda, with 122 notified cases, has the highest rate of the
disease, with 49.1 cases per 100,000 people. Another popular
holiday resort, the Bahamas, follows with 38.0 cases per 100,000.
The rate in the United States is 12.0 per 100,000.
   WHO said that Kuwait, the tiny Comoro Islands republic off East
Africa and San Marino in Europe reported their first case of AIDS.
   Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's AIDS program, said that during
the 1980s, full blown cases of AIDS are believed to have numbered
600,000 and of those, some 300,000 were thought to have died. He
said more than 5 million people became infected with the HIV virus.
   ``The World Health Organization predicts that by the year 2000,
6 million AIDS cases may have occurred. If HIV spread accelerates,
especially in Asia, these estimates will be too conservative,'' he
told his audience in Geneva.
   AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers. It is most often transmitted through sexual contact.
Other means include sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers and transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before
birth.
   At a ceremony to mark the second World AIDS day at WHO's
headquarters, its director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, appointed
Princess Chulabhorn of Thailand as WHO's goodwill ambassador for
the next two years.
   Chulabhorn, who holds a doctorate in organic chemistry, said she
saw as her main task promoting WHO's health objectives among heads
of state throughout the world.
   The daylong event, which focused on young people, included panel
discussions, workshops with local schoolchildren and release of two
new films on AIDS.
   Brightly colored quilts hung on the walls of the WHO building.
   ``Baby Jessica'' was embroidered among pictures of teddy bears
on one large piece of patchwork. A huge patchwork map of Africa
hung in silent tribute to the unknown number of victims on the
continent.
