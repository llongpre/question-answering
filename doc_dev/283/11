   It is a quilt the women of St.
Mary's Church are sewing, calloused fingers punching tiny needles
through thick layers of cloth, but what they bind together is a
community.
   The talk in the basement of the clapboard church is about babies
and sewing patterns, husbands who spent the fall hunting and sons
moving back to town.
   ``... They bought a house ... ''
   ``They move away to make money and then they come back. That
keeps the town going...''
   The chat is as pieced as the pink-and-blue, hearts-and-diamonds
quilt top sewn together at home by Cheryl Rexroat Bunek, who's so
busy with six children and her husband's plumbing business to run
that she can't come to quiltings.
   No conversation goes deep at the biweekly winter meeting of the
St. Mary's quilters, a dozen women around two large quilts
stretched across lumber frames. The quilts, like the women who make
them, generation after generation, stitch together life in this
tiny northern Michigan town, population 368.
   ``We never gossip,'' insists Mildred Kirt, 81, a thin woman with
a cap of short, charcoal gray curls. Her son, Mike, moved back 10
years ago.
   The cold air off Lake Michigan chases two more women down the
stairwell. They add their coats to the pile on the table, their
fingers to the sewing and their voices to the conversation.
   Talk and sew, talk and sew. The ladies of St. Mary's have been
doing this to raise money for the church further back than anyone
can recall, an endless succession of patterns that mirror their
lives: courthouse steps, double wedding ring, Grandma's flower
garden, seven sisters.
   It's a rich tradition of small-town life centered on an aging
church and a country parish of 250 families. The farmers' co-op is
closed and the train depot is gone, but St. Mary's endures.
   ``There wouldn't be much of a town if there wasn't the church,''
says Lynn Edwards, adding a swirling border to frame the calico
heart Mildred is sewing.
   ``For these people, the church is still a center of life, their
social life,'' says the Rev. Walt Derylo. ``Here, you take a step
back in time.''
   He is talking from St. Michael's Church, four miles away in
Suttons Bay. St. Mary's has no resident pastor; there's a shortage
of priests in the church.
   The women talk about that, too.
   ``The Pope should let priests marry,'' one says.
   These women's mothers in 1904 made a signature quilt to raise
money for the church. A dime donation embroidered your place in
devotion, your name stitched in red around the silhouette of St.
Mary's.
   The spread was won at raffle by a priest, who gave it to a
family that needed it for warmth against the Michigan night. The
Leelanau peninsula was timbered bare by then. Poor potato farmers
were all that were left. The rolling peninsula wasn't yet planted
in the quaint cherry orchards that would attract tourists from
Chicago and Detroit, antique shops and condominium builders.
   In summer now, tourists crowd the lanes with 10-speed bicycles,
browse for antiques and take home smoked fish in paper bundles tied
with string.
   But in winter, Lake Leelanau remains shut into itself and the
old ways. The St. Mary's women meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. They
raise about $10,000 a year for the church and its pride, a
101-year-old, 13-grade school.
   The old signature quilt hangs in the Leelanau Historical Museum,
600-some faded names on rough, unbleached muslin.
   ``Gauthier, Belanger ...,'' Curator Laura Quackenbush starts to
read. ``You can see the French-Canadian influence. And the German:
the Schaubs ... Emelia Schaub. Emelia is 96 now, living at the
Omena House nursing home.
   ``She's the first woman prosecutor to practice in Michigan,
elected in 1936 and re-elected five times.'' Actually, another
woman was elected first, but was thrown out by the governor, who
said it was an illegal occupation for women.
   Quilting was part of women's work, a way to keep warm at night,
to tie a community together, to raise money for churches, schools,
the needy. Mennonite women in Oscoda County sell quilts to benefit
a world-wide hunger fund. A woman in eastern Michigan sells her
quilts to pay her son's college tuition.
   ``They used to laugh at us,'' says Barb Merica, at 59 one of the
youngest. ``They,'' are the men, but it's Barb who's laughing now,
eyes twinkling over glasses perched on the end of her nose. The
quilts go for hundreds of dollars each these days. Many never touch
a bed, instead hanging from walls like giant paintings.
   Mildred Kirt doesn't understand. ``These quilts don't seem so
fancy to me.
   ``When I was a girl, I thought my mother was so dumb to cut all
those pieces and sew them back together. But I see now, it's an
art.''
   In 70 years of sewing, Mildred has made quilts for the beds of
her four children and their 15 children and is starting on the
great-grandkids.
   Suzanne Plamondon, 75, did the same for eight kids and 16
grandchildren.
   Jen LaCross made hers for nine children and 28 grandchildren.
   There's a splash of red on the fabric. Claire Routzahn has
pricked herself, hard, and blood drips from her fingertip. She mops
it with a little water. No one pays attention. There's a lot of
blood spilt over a quilt, Barb says.
   And some pain.
   Mildred's mother, Josephine Hahnenberg, was a terror as a
quilter, exacting and demanding of the talents of young brides who
sought admission. Every careless stitch _ hundreds of them _ had to
be ripped out.
   ``I came home crying every night,'' Suzanne says. ``My husband
consoled me, told me not to give up, to stand up to this woman. He
said, `She'll respect you.''' In the end, they became good friends
and fishing buddies.
   Quilting is no longer the rite of womanhood in Lake Leelanau.
Daughters have jobs and other demands.
   It's already been a struggle to keep the group from unraveling.
Barb and Florence Scharnowski and Laura Couturier pitched in to
take over the organizing work when Flo Lamie died of cancer.
``Flo's biggest worry was would the quilting fall apart,'' Barb
says.
   Who is there to replace the replacements?
   Barb sighs. ``If we don't get young blood, like all things, it
will die.''
   The morning wears. The chatter slows. The women roll up the ends
of the finished spread as they work, scooting their chairs forward
and inward. It is godawful cold outside and getting worse as the
day develops but in the warm basement, the women of St. Mary's keep
sewing, knees to knees around an ever-shrinking quilt.
