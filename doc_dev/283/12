<LEADPARA>  FACE the facts: Quilts came off the beds and onto the walls 20 years ago, and
yet, if you say the word "quilt," what springs to mind? smiling Midwestern
grandmothers bent over kitchen tables, piecing together bits of fabric
destined to cover some dusty feather bed.;    "I fight that all the time. And
I don't feel it's changing very fast," says Kathleen Sharp, a Monte Sereno
artist who has been creating quilts for the wall -- not the bed -- since the
late '70s. "People are shocked when they hear the price of a contemporary
quilt," Sharp says. "And a lot of them just get angry."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the summer of 1971, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York
opened a show called "Abstract Design in American Quilts." The exhibit hung 61
quilts on the walls so the world could see their clean, elegant designs that
so clearly mimicked modern art.;    The show traveled the country and abroad,
and then triggered a whole stream of quilt exhibits. The cumulative effect was
not simply a new generation of quilt makers, but a whole new phenomenon: the
artist-made quilt.;    "Now," says Jonathan Holstein, co-curator (with his
wife, Gail van der Hoof) of the 1971 Whitney show, "there are a number of
really extraordinary artists who are making quilts, who might a generation ago
have turned to painting.";    The Whitney show, says Holstein, who is writing
a book about the exhibit and its aftermath, "freed a younger generation of
quilt makers to look at the design of their quilts first and their function
last.";    These days, one can find artist-made quilts of all sizes, imagery
and materials.;    Even so, that never-ending tug of war between fine art and
utilitarian craft still pulls full tilt at the nation's quilt threads. And the
resulting questions seem endless.;    Can warm, comforting quilts really have
a place in the cold, snobbish world of contemporary art? Can quilts made to
hang on the wall as art really be called quilts? Can a medium chosen for its
tactile qualities be put on a museum wall with a DO NOT TOUCH label -- without
losing its very reason for being?;    It's enough to send any non-quilter
crawling back under the covers.;    But not so the quilt artists.;    Northern
California, and the Bay Area in particular, is something of a hotbed for quilt
art. It is home to internationally recognized quilt artists. Open almost any
quilt show catalog and you'll see Northern California names:;    (check) Joan
Schulze of Sunnyvale, known for painterly and poetic images of skies, clouds
and gardens, and political imagery. In 1984 she was hired by the Australian
government to teach throughout that country for three months. She returned in
1989 and again earlier this year, to teach master classes in conjunction with
her own 12-quilt show. Since the mid-'80s, Schulze has also been making
"earthquake" quilts, the latest bordered with plastic police "caution" tape
from earthquake sites. "The traditionalists? They're very afraid of me,"
Schulze says.;    (check) Therese May of San Jose, know for playful imagery of
animals and everyday objects (including salt shakers and sugar bowls) and
loose, free-wheeling threads. This week she taught at Arrowmont School of Arts
and Crafts in Gatlinburg, Tenn. Last month, her 14-foot "Animal Spiral" quilt
was installed in the San Jose Convention Center's west entrance, off Almaden
Boulevard. The $35,820 commission was something of a coup for all quilt
artists. Says May, "It's given me a whole new outlook on life.";    (check)
Yvonne Porcella of Modesto, known for sock-it-to-'em color and bright, peppy
imagery, is a driving force in the art quilt world. She recently founded
Studio Art Quilt Associates, a non-profit group whose aim is to further
recognition for quilt artists.;    Some of Porcella's latest efforts can be
seen through Aug. 3 in San Jose, at the American Museum of Quilts and
Textiles. "What a Difference the Years Make" aims to show the quilt's
transformation from historic object to modern art. Yet the exhibit, dominated
by Porcella's own colorful quilts (eight are on view) seems to stumble over
its own good intentions.;    The show's most striking image is "A Fragile
Balance: A Green Quilt," a folksy tribute to the troubled Earth, rich with
beads, buttons and gloves. Yet the quilt, by Jane Burch Cochran of Rabbit
Hash, Ky., is tucked into the museum's back room, not far from a humming
copier machine. Perhaps a more modest curator would have seen to it that her
own images were fewer, and farther from the choicest exhibit space.;    There
is, however, a certain charm to the San Jose quilt museum, where staff chat
away in the gift shop, and a visitor strolling through can find a stray cherry
pit rolling across the floor.;    It all seems part of that quaint quilt
feeling. And there's nothing wrong with that. That feeling, af ter all, is
what drew many contemporary artists to the medium in the first place.;    
"There's something about the tactile quality of the fabric," says May,
explaining why, as an artist trained in painting, she chooses to make quilts.
"And there's something about constructing something, putting things together,
that you don't get in painting. And there's a feeling of security when you're
sewing that isn't present in painting.";     "It's like painting, but
different," Holstein says. "You also have the beautiful surfaces of textiles
-- the tactile qualities of the surface -- which, even if you're not touching
them, give you an added dimension. They have depth, they hold the light
differently.";    Nana Montgomery of Lompico began making quilts at age 13,
while growing up in the Santa Cruz Mountains. She studied painting at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, then earned her master's degree in quilt
art at San Francisco State University in 1990.;    "There was just a certain
passion with fabric," she says. "I didn't really equate it with art, so I
approached art from a traditional manner, painting. But I continued to make
quilts. There was just something about it.";    Montgomery calls her own moody
works "mysterious" and she says she was greatly influenced by the work of
Therese May. "I saw it and I was just blown away because it was so neat," she
says.;    Kathleen Sharp met Montgomery in 1984, when the two exhibited
together in Los Gatos. "Nana is a national resource that should be guarded,"
Sharp says.;    Sharp, who often creates quilts of strikingly
three-dimensional architectural imagery, was also drawn to the medium for its
tactile qualities. "I can't walk through a department store in less than 20
minutes," she says, "because I have to go touch everything and understand how
it feels, all the textures and the fibers.";    Most contemporary quilters
have a few stories to tell about the flak they take from traditional quilters,
those who still believe quilts must be completely hand-sewn with perfect
stitches and perfect edges. Most contemporary quilt artists still follow the
three-layer quilt rule: front, back and batting. But thereafter, the kinship
with history ends.;    So why do these contemporary artists still call their
work a quilt? Why not do away with the word?;    "We believe that there is a
name recognition to that," says Porcella. "And there's been a lot of
discussion whether or not we should carry that burden of the word 'quilt' with
us, because some of us obviously don't follow that ruling.";    Says Schulze,
"I think it's very pretentious to call your work the 'art quilt.' . . . I know
there's a big movement to call them art quilts or studio quilts, but I think
it's enough to say it's a quilt and let people make up their own mind. I've
always liked the idea that they could be on a bed.";    For some, that duality
of art and function is part of the quilt's appeal.;    "It's wonderful that
they have that sense of history and that sense of 'Gee, what are we doing
here, what are we messing with?' " Holstein says. "Because for the first time
you have in this medium a group of highly talented men and women -- more women
than men, but some men, too -- who are aware of the history, who are aware of
their history (as artists) and are aware of the fact that they are making
history.;    "I like that a lot," Holstein adds. "They're working on the edge
. . . on the edge of their sensibilities and their sense of history and their
sense of themselves (as artists.) Artists should be kept on the edge, it's
when they do their best work.";  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;    (check) "What a
