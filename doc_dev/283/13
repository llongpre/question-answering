<LEADPARA>  Through the ages, quilts have done more than keep their owners snug. In
colonial days, the patchwork comforters provided a social event for women who
gathered to make them. Later, artists used quilts to depict scenes in fabric.
In recent years, sewers have created a quilt of names commemorating people who
have died from AIDS.;    Now, a second-graders' class in Fremont is using a
quilt for yet another purpose: To stimulate interest in reading.  </LEADPARA>

PROJECT PROMOTES READING WITH WARMTH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Thirty children from Mission San Jose Elementary School drew pictures last
month depicting scenes from their favorite fables by Aesop and Arnold Lobel.
Two mothers, Sharon Gallacher and Sylvia Cooper, transferred the drawings onto
squares of muslin fabric, and let the children color their drawings with
glitter and paint.;    Last week, Gallacher and Cooper sewed the squares
together -- creating a colorful "literary quilt" depicting a safari of
storybook animals and morals. Starting this week, the quilt is to be hung in
the children's area of the Fremont Main Library amid a display of fable
books.;    Cooper and Gallacher said they had expected the quilt would help
generate interest in reading, but they were surprised at the beauty of their
product. The 60-by-65-inch comforter has 30 different scenes featuring
everything from a naughty kangaroo that shoots spitballs to a beautiful
princess in a glittering gown. It has crocodiles, swans, bears, dogs,
grasshoppers and birds. The scenes are bordered in paisley.;    "There's a
richness and a softness about it," said Cooper, a costume designer who has
made several quilts in the past. "It's like a stained glass window. The thing
that's so special is, the pictures came from everybody, but they go so well
together. The drawings are fantastic. Now I want one of these quilts for
myself.";    Once the quilt display ends, in about a month, the storytelling
bed cover will probably go back to the second-grade teacher.;    Bonnie
Janssen, the Fremont children's librarian, said making the quilt is a good
learning method for the children -- and for quilt viewers.;    "When you do a
physical thing relating to a book, it kind of cements the book in your mind,"
Janssen said. "And by having it up in the library, it can trigger interest
among people coming in. It has a kind of two-fold stimulation.";    The
children, who are from Sara Truebridge's second-grade class, marveled at the
quilt as they watched it come together. "The kids had so much fun making it, I
think they realized what a big thing it was going to turn out to be," Cooper
said.;    Gallacher, who is a member of "Bookleggers," a parent group trained
at the library to introduce books to youngsters in Fremont schools, said she
started the project by having a quilt maker visit Truebridge's class, display
some quilts and discuss the history of the art.;    "Kids were all sitting
there with their mouths open when they saw all the quilts," said Kelly
Gallacher, 7, Sharon's daughter, who is one of the quilt-making children. "I
think ours is gonna look pretty good."  </TEXT>
