<LEADPARA>  TWO YEARS ago, quilt artists around the globe were issued this challenge: "If
quilt making is your gift and the Earth is your concern, join us.";   The
result of that message, which is still being sent today by artist Susan Shie,
is the Green Quilt movement. The work of 15 artists -- and local
schoolchildren -- is on display in the in the first West Coast exhibition of
the Green Quilts project at the American Museum of Quilts and Textiles in
downtown San Jose. They are among 500 quilts being shown worldwide.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "There are quilts around the world, forming a kind of cosmic ozone," said
Shie. "And it is impossible to tell how many are in progress.";   In addition,
different techniques are employed in producing the quilts. "For example, in
this exhibition, it ranges from tiny, tiny embroidery and precise, exquisite
detail to a work like 'Hole in the Ozone,' which is very raw and slap dash,
almost abstract," said Shie. "Exhibitgoers will be surprised by the quilts,
which are more like paintings, a fine art form.";   The Green Quilt movement
came at a crossroads for Shie, an Ohio artist with a master's degree in fine
arts from Kent State University.;   "I was really caught up in the concept of
affirmation after a lifetime of being caught up in protest. The two concepts
don't coexist. One is positive, the other negative," she said.;   At that time
-- January 1989 -- there was a push to build a medical waste incinerator in
the middle of Shie's town. She would attend environmental meetings and come
home "all fired up.";   "I asked myself, how could I do something that would
help the world, not antagonize, but present solutions, and contribute energy
to these solutions," said the 41-year-old Shie. "I decided I would make these
quilts.";   Shie and her husband, Jim Accord, a self-taught artist with more
than 14 years' experience in working with leather, then made the first Green
Quilt from March to August 1989. Called "Back to Eden," the quilt was intended
to affirm the overall rebalancing of the Earth.;   "It depicted the Earth when
it was brand new," said Shie. "To understand the Green Quilt project you have
to open to cosmic thinking.";   Visitors entering the small museum are
immediately greeted by the striking image of "The Water Quilt." Vibrant blues
and rich purples, along with metallic shades are the dominant colors. Doves,
dolphins, fish and sea horses dance across the quilt's surface.;   Messages
include "Water is our life." The elaborately embellished panels, created by
Shie and Accord, are just the beginning of what the exhibition has to offer.; 
 "Endangered Species" is the result of an earlier field trip to the museum by
first- and second-graders at Horace Mann School in San Jose. Inspired by the
exhibit "A Celebration of Earth and Sea," the children each made a panel
featuring an endangered animal. The endearing quilt depicts 14 animals,
including a wolf, a river otter, a Spanish lynx, a whooping crane and a bald
eagle. The project was led by teachers Lynn Bauer and Joan Hagan, and parents
Janet Burdick and Carol Zeppa.;   Illinois artist Susan Mosler drew on her
joyful memory of a secluded path leading through the dunes to the North Sea in
Holland, when creating "Dunes No. 4." The beiges and blues of the hand-painted
muslin, along with found shells and lapis lazuli, truly convey the feeling of
looking across the rolling dunes to the sea. Said Mosler, " 'Dunes' focuses on
protecting and healing the untamed places in ourselves and on the Earth.";  
There is the very whimsical "Look Through Any Window" by Maine artist Natasha
Kempers-Cullen. This quilt is a collection of small windows, each depicting an
object or scene holding a special meaning to Kempers-Cullen.;   Plastic slide
mounts are used to create the windows, and netting serves as window screening
to soften the scenes. The tiny windows include such images as a hula dancer,
mail box, a rainy day, a country fence, a kite and a hearth with a fire. In
all, there are more than 90 frames.;   New York artist Katherine Knauer's
13-year old son is the subject of the fun-loving quilt portrait, "A Boy and
His Frog." According to Knauer, her son is a typical "frog-catching,
animal-loving kid." The quilt itself suggests the love of the Earth and its
creatures shared by children worldwide, she said. Diverse textures and the
entire spectrum of greens are used in this quilt which features 19 frogs, some
highly visible and others cleverly hidden.;   Local artist Therese May's
contribution to Green Quilts is "Courage," a small quilt that May said
originally began as quite a different concept. She had been asked to create a
quilt based on a chair theme for an exhibit in which she was participating.;  
"My nature is to not go along with other people's ideas. The creative process
for me is not a logical one. It's very random, intuitive, spontaneous," May
said.;   Nevertheless, May created a small image of a chair. "I built out from
there using imagery that was closer to how I really felt. Little smiling dogs
with teeth and later the all-knowing cat was added with paint. Then I wrote
'Courage' across the top, an affirmation of encouragement to all people," said
May.;   For May, it is an affirmation for herself and others to have the
courage to break through barriers, doing the things one wants to do, but may
be afraid to. It is this positive message that qualifies "Courage" as a Green
Quilt.;   May's quilts are made up of playful fantasy animal and plant imagery
and are machine appliqued using straight and satin stitch. Threads are left
uncut forming a texture across the quilts. Acrylic paint is added as a final
touch. "Courage" uses colors that are strong, vibrant and dramatic. There is
contrast, activity and, most of all, energy.;   "It says, have courage, but
don't take yourself too seriously," said May, who has been making quilts since
1965.;   May believes that exhibitgoers will find something very special about
Green Quilts. "Artists often worry, 'What use is art?' But we have a good
vehicle to share these messages," she said.;   "Hopefully those visiting Green
Quilts will have enjoyed a great show and come away with a heightened
consciousness about saving the environment. And be inspired to do something
themselves," May said.;   Said project creator Shie: "People ask, 'When will
the Green Quilt project end?' My answer to that is when the Earth is back to
that perfect state. It's an indefinite time span."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Green
