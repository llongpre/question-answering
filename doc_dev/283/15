<LEADPARA>  THE kind of aprons made and worn and given as gifts in the 1940s and '50s are
like patchwork quilts. They were made of leftovers -- half a yard of muslin
left from the guest-room curtains, a couple of scraps of flowered chintz from
covering the cushion on the porch swing and maybe a yard of rickrack left from
making a child's pinafore. Karen Sharrar, a Philadelphia physician who
treasures a collection of aprons made by her grandmother, can still remember
the dresses that went into them.;   Aprons are also like quilts because most
of them were utilitarian, though some were more utilitarian than others. Women
might save their prettiest ones for serving dinner or pouring tea, and then
have another category of somewhat less delicate ones for baking and dusting
and vacuuming, and still another, sturdier category for messier jobs. Some of
Sharrar's plainer aprons are well worn, but the fancier ones, with the
inventive pockets, the set-in panels made from fancy handkerchiefs and the
scalloped bottoms or harlequin points, are still crisp and perfect after all
these years of being saved for company.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Aprons are especially like quilts in their unnecessary gorgeousness, the
exuberance and inventiveness of their design. They provided the women who made
them with an opportunity to create a beautiful, useful object that combined
shapes and patterns and colors in a way unique to itself, even as it showcased
their needlework skills.;   Some of Sharrar's aprons are pieced together --
probably because the leftover scraps of fabric weren't big enough for the
design her grandmother had in mind -- so artfully you can barely see the
seams. The heart-shaped pocket on a white organdy apron is attached with hand
stitches so tiny they're nearly invisible.;   Gorgeous as old aprons are,
hardly anybody wants them now. Patchwork quilts go for hundreds or thousands
or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, but you can still find beautifully
hand-sewn, one-of-a-kind aprons in perfect condition for 50 cents or a dollar
at yard sales, thrift shops and flea markets.;   You might think it's because
people still sleep under quilts but hardly anybody -- except for backyard
barbecue artists and a few holdouts like Sharrar -- wears aprons. Or maybe
quilts deserve to cost more because they're so much bigger.;   But it's not
just that. The apron is a discredited symbol of a role that's come to be
despised. Only a few weeks ago a school library book censor said she'd get rid
of any book that showed women only in aprons.;   The elaborate design and
painstaking execution of aprons like Sharrar's enshrined housekeeping as a
sacred vocation, a respected role, a lifework. Even now, it testifies to the
status early 20th-century America accorded to the pursuit of shiny floors,
flaky pie crusts, invisible hems and blindingly white sheets.;   Some women
still turn out flaky pie crusts and keep their floors waxed, and most do a
certain amount of cooking and cleaning, but it doesn't count as a vocation
anymore, and nobody admires you for doing it well. Now, it's just something
you have to do to avoid living in squalor. So you don't dress up for it: You
do it in jeans too ruined to wear for anything else, not crisp organdy ruffles
and rickrack.  </TEXT>
