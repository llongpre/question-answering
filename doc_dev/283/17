<LEADPARA>  IF THE words crochet, knit, needlepoint, cross-stitch, applique or quilt
strike a responsive chord with you, or someone you know, here's a batch of new
books to devour.;   Obviously it's too late to actually make any of the
projects outlined in the books in time for this year's holiday gift-giving,
except perhaps the ones in the napkin book, but there are wonderful projects
to contemplate for the new year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Big Knits" by Dawn French and Sylvie Soudan (Century Hutchinson Ltd.,
$24.95) -- Actress Dawn French is better known to British television viewers
than American, but her thoughts on fashion are ones that women everywhere can
identify with. Aimed at the "ampler, more gorgeous woman," like herself, "Big
Knits" contains patterns for more than 25 large-size sweaters, skirts and
cardigans in styles from casual summer cottons to soft and sexy evening looks.
French and two other large-size women model the designs of Soudan, who designs
for English and U.S. yarn companies. While this book is aimed at a specific
market, the patterns will also work for pregnant women.;   "Glorafilia: The
Venice Collection" by Carole Lazarus and Jennifer Berman (MacMillan, $35) --
Whether you can do a decent needlepoint stitch or not is really beside the
point with this book. It's a feast for your eyes, as the authors take you down
the alleys and canals of this jewel of a city, showing you where the
inspiration comes from for 25 needlepoint and embroidery projects. Even if you
don't have Fortuny-fabric drapes in need of a needlepoint curtain tieback --
you can dream.;   "The Jean Moss Designer Knits Collection" by Jean Moss
(MacMillan, $35) -- If you're a fan of the aristocratic English look
personified by the sweaters of Laura Ashley and Ralph Lauren, you're already a
fan of Moss, who has designed for both firms. As you would expect, the 33
sweaters include variations on Fair Isle and Aran classics. The sum of them
all is a sweet sort of sophisticated look that money and time can buy.;  
"Quick Napkin Creations," by Gail Brown (Open Chain Publishing, $12.95) -- If
you appreciate cloth napkins for their aesthetic value, this book is a joy. It
includes 18 different techniques for making your own napkins, including a
couple that don't require a sewing machine. There's also a section on folding
napkins -- a delightful pastime that is reminiscent of days gone by when
setting a table was an art and details took on great importance.;   "In
Splendid Detail" by Catherine Reurs (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chan, $27.50) -- This
book is a glorification of Reurs' talents and commissions for the wealthy and
well known. It's meant to serve as an inspiration, so the 19 actual how-to
patterns are relegated to the back of the book. But before you get to the
Pineapple Christmas Ornament instructions, you can feast your eyes on Reurs'
rendition of the Palm Court in London's Ritz Hotel with its 31,000 stitches; a
commission for Isabella Rossellini of the studio she retreats to on Long
Island; and a needlepoint birth announcement.;   "For The Baby" by Erica
Wilson (Little, Brown, $19.95) -- This latest offering from Wilson, whose name
is synonymous with needlecraft, is a celebration of babies. There are booties
to knit, dresses to smock, Christening gowns to embroider, a Noah's Ark to
quilt and a Babar sweater to knit among the 70 projects. Because Wilson is so
prolific, she is easy to take for granted when she should be appreciated.;  
"The Complete Needlepoint Course" by Anna Pearson (Chilton, $27.95) -- This is
a book for both beginners and the very experienced -- a how-to guide on
techniques from tent and bargello stitching to pulled thread work, surface
work and the use of metallic threads. It's an excellent reference book that
would be a welcome addition to any needlework library.  </TEXT>
