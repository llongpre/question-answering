   State officials said Friday they won't
dismantle the world's largest quilt, stitched for the state's
centennial. But a more troublesome question remains: What do you do
with an 800-pound bedcover?
   ``It is not an historical artifact today. A hundred years from
now it will be,'' Centennial Commission member Vern Neff said
before the panel voted 13-2 to keep the quilt in one piece.
   Leona Tennyson, 74, who with 7,000 volunteers from across North
Dakota stitched together the quilt, has sworn to ``fight to the
end'' to keep her labor of love from being dismantled.
   The quilt, certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as
the world's largest a year ago, measures 85 by 134 feet, 1{ times
as long and wide as a basketball court.
   Still, the commission has no idea how the quilt will figure in
its plans for the state's 100th birthday celebration this year.
   The giant bedcover, which takes as many as 40 people to carry,
depicts each of the state's 53 counties and 1,358 townships. It is
being stored at Minot State University's athletic center.
   Some people say the quilt should be dismantled and returned to
the counties that made its parts because it is unmanageable in its
present form.
   The state museum has turned it down, but Tennyson has pledged to
find a permanent place to display her creation, with or without the
state's help.
   In voting to keep the quilt intact, the Centennial Commission
asked Tennyson to set the conditions under which she will surrender
it.
   Tennyson was unswayed Friday by the commission's decision to
keep the quilt in one piece.
   ``I have said that from the start,'' she said in a telephone
interview from her home in Antler. ``I don't know what to say. I am
not going to say nothing about it until I can decide what is what.
We have plans here too for it.''
   State Tourism Director Jim Fuglie said the quilt simply was too
precious to think about dismantling. ``It may be the most special
thing that comes out of this centennial,'' Fuglie said.
   The Adams County Tourism Committee was specific in its request
to acquire the quilt.
   ``Our plans are either to cover the quilt with a layer of
Plexiglas or construct a series of catwalks which would allow
viewers of the quilt to walk several feet above the surface of the
quilt,'' wrote Jeff Rotering, a lawyer in Hettinger.
   Hal Gershman of Grand Forks, a commission member, suggested the
Grand Forks city auditorium might eventually be available to
display the quilt, if the city builds a new civic center.
   ``We envision the old auditorium being an arts center,'' he said.
   There have been plenty of ideas about what to do with the quilt
since its plight was publicized, said commission member Woody
Gagnon. One woman suggested wrapping it around the 19-story state
Capitol in Bismarck to ``save on heat bills,'' he said.
