<TEXT>  Dutton, $18.95; TEXTILE treasures -- in the form of antique quilts -- are
featured in Gladys-Marie Fry's colorfully illustrated and carefully researched
"Stitched From the Soul: Slave Quilts from the Ante-Bellum South.";   The book
is a celebration of black quilters whose often-outstanding work long has been
ignored. (At times, the author notes, the needlework of slave women was
attributed to their plantation mistress.);   Fry, a university professor whose
great-great-grandmother drudged on an Arkansas plantation, explores the
historical and social aspects of quilting among slave women and discusses the
design aesthetics (often reflecting African mythology) that characterize many
of their quilts.  </TEXT>
