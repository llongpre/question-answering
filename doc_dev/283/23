<TEXT>  Villard Books, 179 pp. $18;  LIKE a happy marriage, "How To Make an American
Quilt," Whitney Otto's first novel, is a creation both wondrous and rare.;   
Using the patchwork method of quilting, the San Francisco author lovingly
stitches together the lives of eight women, revealing the essence of their
individual characters within a larger pattern of female culture. Otto
introduces each woman's story with a chapter of "Instructions" on quilting, a
boldly didactic device that gives the novel historical depth and resonance --
as well as a quirky charm.;    The voice of the novel, although she is not one
of its characters, is Finn Bennett-Dodd, a young woman of the 1980s besieged
by what we now call options. In a prologue, Finn tells us that she has browsed
her way through life to become, at 26, a graduate student in history. But she
finds herself as interested in the small footnotes of her studies as she is in
rigorous historical inquiry. Finn tells us that she wants "both things, the
silly and the sublime; a grudgingly true past." When Sam, whom she truly
loves, asks her to marry him, Finn realizes that what she most urgently needs
to know is how to merge with another and still be herself.;    True education
begins;    Finn retreats to Grasse, a small town north of Bakersfield, "to
take a little time to think." During a fiercely hot summer, she visits with
her grandmother Hyacinth Dodd and her great-aunt Gladiola Josephine Cleary.
(The sisters are known in Grasse as The Flower Girls). As she lazes on their
broad front porch, she studies the eight older women who gather regularly to
quilt.;    Eavesdropping on the hum of their conversation, Finn's true
education begins. For embedded in the art of quilt making and the stories of
women who matured in decades that offered females fewer choices are the truths
both homely and sublime that Finn needs to piece together the quilt of her own
life.;    Lighting out for the territory, hitting the road to escape the
suffocating confines of female domesticity, is a classic theme of the American
novel. But what if our gender keeps us at home with no chance to enact the
drama of a journey? For women, the quilt, with its possibilities for
elaboration within a restricted field, has become a powerful metaphor. As the
Instructions note: "With patience, many puzzle pieces will fit together to
make a whole picture.";    The desire for wholeness informs the lives of the
eight quilters. The Flower Girls, Glady Joe and Hy, are sisters who come of
age in the 1930s to make very different marriages. The union of the sensual,
stylish Hy (too stylish for a dusty valley town) is one of passion, while
quiet, thoughtful Glady Joe finds herself sexually incompatible with her
Arthur, yet loves him deeply as a friend.;    Passion and reconstruction;   
In their middle age when her sister and Arthur betray her (for poignant
reasons of their own), Glady Joe cements her kitchen and laundry room ceiling
and walls with the broken fragments of precious keepsakes she has hurled at
Arthur in her rage. After both husbands die, Hy moves in with Glady Joe -- but
never can bring herself to enter those utilitarian rooms with their glittering
mosaics of broken faith.;    This passion, waste and reconstruction is coolly
observed by Anna Neale, the sometime housekeeper of the Flower Girls, the
leader of the quilting group and the moral center of the novel. The daughter
of a black mother and an unknown white father, as a girl Anna reveres her
black heritage, represented by a quilt sewn by her great-great-grandmother and
called "The Life Before." Hoping to buy a telescope for Anna who wants to
study the stars, her aunt painfully sells the quilt to a white employer for
$15.;    But without the quilt, a pictorial celebration of life before
slavery, Anna loses interest in the stars. Why, Anna wonders, couldn't she
have both the quilt and the telescope; her history and her future? When she
turns 16, Anna steals the quilt from its buyer -- who doesn't care about the
stories it tells, only its strange beauty -- and runs away. Repeating her
mother's pattern, from a brief liaison with a white ranch owner's son, at 17
she bears a daughter, Marianna, whom she decides to raise on her own in
Grasse.;     With no chance for happy matrimony herself in a small, all-white
town in the 1930s, Anna studies the marriages of the women of Grasse through
their quilting. Some of the quilters seek the pictorial dream of the
traditional coverlet; others are drawn to the crazy quilt's freedom of form.; 
  Quilts reflect marriages;     Sophia Darling prefers "the discipline and
predictability of an established pattern." To avoid her mother's fate of being
deserted by her father, Sophia becomes too good a wife, smothering the wild
spirit that her husband once so loved in her.;    Another quilter, Constance
Saunders, is drawn to the impulsive, unplanned crazy quilt; she believes her
itinerant marriage to Howell, a traveling salesman, suits her independent,
solitary spirit. Only when Howell retires and they settle down to a permanent
life in Grasse does Constance realize with wonder how entirely happy she is in
her husband's company. She muses that perhaps in their earlier life, "I had to
keep a locked restraint on my affection . . . knowing he would always come and
go and never stay for good." Constance's late appreciation of her marriage
gives radiance to their final years together.;    After Howell's death,
Constance becomes friends with Dean, the roving husband of another quilter,
Em. Dean is a failed artist for whom romance is the only adventure he can
change or control; Em wants a marriage that can be displayed without fear of
damage, like a quilt mounted under plexiglass. Determined at last to leave
him, Em enters Dean's studio and sees painting after painting of herself, over
time, from every angle. And realizing "how married they really are," she
cannot part with a man who knows her so thoroughly.;    Happy about marriage; 
  In swift vignettes, "How to Make an American Quilt" penetrates to the core
of its characters' lives. Only Marianna, Anna's beautiful daughter, seems
conceived to fit the design of the book rather than distilled from life.
Marianna goes to work in France grafting roses ("some roses cannot survive the
environment into which they are born"), a heavy-handed metaphor for her own
divided culture. Given choices of which her mother never dreamed, eventually
Marianna returns alone to Grasse to make quilts, preferring abstract designs.;
    At novel's end, Finn has learned no easy how-to formula for a successful
marriage. But after talking with Anna about the various quilters, she's firmly
happy about marrying Sam. Her hot summer on the porch has left her imbued with
faith that a marriage, as she says, "has just as good a chance of being
wonderful as it does of missing the mark. . . . And, contrary to what current
belief is, it has always been so.";    "How to Make an American Quilt'
introduces a wise author of exceptional promise.  </TEXT>
