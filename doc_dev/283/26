<LEADPARA>  MOST families have their treasures: the quilt Grandma so lovingly stitched by
hand, square by square; the mantel clock that has passed from generation to
generation; the silver picture frame that once belonged to a favorite aunt.;  
 These treasures often come into our lives to mark special events: births,
graduations, weddings.  </LEADPARA>

QUALITY KEEPSAKES NEEDN'T BE OLD. YOU CAN
ACQUIRE TODAY WHAT WILL BE TOMORROW'S TREASURE  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     But more and more, people are not waiting for a special event to acquire a
precious keepsake. Whether it is a new piece of art glass or an antique rug,
people are searching for objects that will become tomorrow's heirlooms.;   
Quality is an overriding concern. Good design is equally important. And for
most, the object must radiate a certain warmth.;    "The '90s are very much
family oriented," says Barbara Tober, editor in chief of Bride's magazine.
"The gloss, the glitz is not what people are interested in. They want a homey
quality, even if it has to be instant, like finding monogrammed linens in a
thrift shop.";    There are several reasons for the new popularity of
heirlooms, including a greater appreciation of our own histories. "Brides are
older today," says Tober. "They realize the intrinsic value of things that
belonged to their grandmother, which might not have interested them as
teen-agers. They begin to realize the value of objects with longevity and
heritage.";    The transient nature of our society is also a factor, says Phil
Miller, vice president of the Howard Miller Co., which has manufactured
grandfather and other clocks since 1926. "Many objects are disposable: clothes
and even homes, which we may change as our lifestyles do.;    "But heirlooms
are transportable. And above all, they must have the ability to pull to the
heart, to draw some emotional response.";    Avoid antiques, try artisans;   
In searching for a piece with heirloom potential, you can go the traditional
route through antique dealers or, if budget is a factor, thrift shops. But
today, a host of artisans are at work crafting some exciting alternatives.;   
(box)  Silver. Historically, among the most popular heirlooms is a family's
silver. Some parents begin to collect silver pieces for their daughters when
they're born.;    Contemporary silversmith David Bacharach has expanded the
choices far beyond the standard place setting or pie server, offering works of
art to display year-round. Bacharach is a former dentist who hand-forges
exquisite serving pieces of etched brass and silver that command a place on
top of, not in, the sideboard.;    (box)  Art glass. Fine glassware has long
been a popular collectible. But there is a more affordable option than
crystal: art glass, which is crafted by glass artisans, one of the strongest
contingents of the American crafts movement.;    The selection of new art
glass includes stunning large decorative plates and bowls, and functional
pieces such as water and wine goblets, vases, paperweights and perfume
bottles.;    Glass provides homey feeling;    "Everyone wants to make a
personal expression about his home and environment," says Ann Corcoran, who
specializes in free-blown glass -- glass made without molds -- at Nourot Glass
Studio in Benicia.;    "In a time where much is keypunched and computerized,
through art glass you can get a glimmer of what it's like to create from
scratch, and of past eras when everything was done by hand. Pick up a piece of
purple glass and hold it to the light.";    (box)  Furniture. Perhaps no other
dealer in new home furnishings captures the concept of
furniture-as-potential-heirloom better than Ralph Lauren. His designs are
classic but often have a fresh twist: a floral teapot that is trimmed in
plaid; a chair seat upholstered in wool plaid with a needlepoint back; a
settee with a hand-painted leather back and a plaid seat.;    Besides having a
timeless style, these pieces are built to last. They are clearly intended to
be tomorrow's heirlooms.;    (box)  Clocks. Some heirlooms speak to you
directly. "Clocks are among the few possessions that take on a personality,"
says Phil Miller. "They almost become human. They can move and talk every 15
minutes. There's a personal involvement with them; you need to wind them once
a week, and for some that even becomes a tradition to pass on to the eldest
child.";    Not all of us have the room or budget for a grandfather clock. But
there are plenty of handsome alternatives. Howard Miller clocks range from
$600 to $10,000, the most expensive bearing elegant etched dials of brass,
pewter or silver plating. The signature series includes a solid brass plate
engraved with the purchaser's name and date acquired.;    (box)  Quilts.
"Quilts are probably the purest form of American folk art," says Judi Boisson,
who boasts a huge collection of reproduction quilts at her retail shop in
Southampton, N.Y. "They really traverse all social classes, reaching black,
white, wealthy, poor. They're so versatile. People can cover up their beds,
hang them on walls, use them as throws.";    Boisson also sells vintage
quilts, but at prices out of reach for the average buyer. The reproductions
range from $195 (baby quilts) to just under $1,000. Each of the all-cotton
quilts is marked and dated.;    (box)  Rugs. Rugs also have staying power.
Many rugs today are being created in the same manner as the old, with wool
colored by natural vegetable dyes and spun by hand.;    George Jevremovic says
his company, Woven Legends, is dedicated to "reviving the art of the rug.";   
Jevremovic directs nomads in southeast Turkey to weave to his specifications,
with designs patterned after old ones. "We get weavers to play a lot with
color and design. There's a spontaneity, variation and charm. Every rug we
produce is unique.";    (box)   The personal touch. You can also create your
own heirlooms. Making one-of-a-kind objects to give as gifts can be a lovely
sentiment. After all, it's personality and tradition that really make
keepsakes fascinating.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; (check) David Bacharach, Adesso
