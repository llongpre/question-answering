<LEADPARA>  CALVIN Klein thinks less is more.;    Here is one designer who has found his
forte -- ageless clothing with clean, simple lines. Eschewing extraneous
details and gimmicks, he is content to pare away until all that is left is a
cloth sculpture that is eminently wearable.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Klein's personal vision of fall is pale. Colors are understated and the
very few prints in his collection are subtle paisleys, jacquards or foulards.
Even his evening satins are pale peridot green or gold and his beading is more
matte than flash.;    For daytime, Klein offers toasty knit tunics that flare
toward their midthigh hem, worn over matching tights in a deep mahogany red or
black. They look both comfortable and, if you've got the legs, very chic.;   
There are also what Klein calls "jacket dresses," which are a lighter version
of the coat dress; short skirts with a slight drape in front; wrap skirts;
velvet stretch pants; cuffed trousers and cardigan jackets.;    Klein shines
after dark with a series of short, matte crepe shifts that skim the body; lace
slip dresses with no linings; several beaded dresses in T-shirt and slip
styles; and some beaded coats with matching, slim pants. Evening colors are
metallic silver, gold, copper or bronze.;    While Klein's collection for fall
added up to 95 separate outfits and many, many ideas, relative newcomer
Christian Francis Roth presented 39 outfits and two themes.;    Roth devoted
the first half of his show to hobo-inspired patches. In his program notes,
Roth writes, "If a hobo has a suit with holes, he patches it up. If a woman
gets a hole in her jacket, why shouldn't she patch it? Or get one from me,
pre-patched?" The difference between the patching a hobo might do and the
painstaking piecing together of contrasting materials that Roth does is as
much a contrast as a night in a boxcar to a night in the Biltmore.;    The
second part of Roth's collection is inspired by Amish quilts. Using both the
subdued tones of real Amish quilts and some brighter colors, he recreates
quilt patterns such as Diamond in the Square, Checkerboard, Zig-Zag and Bars
in large shawls and as border patterns on dresses and skirts.;    The red,
purple and aqua skirt in a Tumbling Blocks quilt pattern with zig-zag hem is
eye-popping. Also striking are ankle-length circle skirts in a Lone Star or
Bars quilt pattern.;    Roth accessorizes some jackets with wool scarves,
again in quilt patterns, that are just plain pretty. Expect to see a smart
scarf manufacturer join this quilting bee in a hurry.;    Other designers with
fall collections worth noting include:;     Eleanor P. Brenner;  Eleanor
Brenner's sporty EPB Easy label includes the liberal use of zippers and
stretch fabrics, particularly in stirrup pants and leggings. For fun there are
some themed sweaters, jackets and dresses with hearts and kisses or casino
gambling chips.;    The more serious Eleanor P. Brenner Ltd. label takes
menswear fabrics and feminizes them by using clear sequins to create
pinstripes on a tweed blazer or lace overlays on the hem of a cardigan
jacket.;    Brenner also likes the look of long, lean jackets with straight
skirts peeking out an inch or two below the jacket hem; a sporty V-neck tennis
sweater trimmed in sequins worn over a short sequin skirt; and the look of
tussah silk in narrow pants, bandeau tops, jackets and dresses.;    Jennifer
George;  A key part of Jennifer George's fall line is a group of trompe l'oeil
jackets that deceive the eye -- they look like two or three layers of
clothing, even though they are one-piece affairs.;    Standouts from George
include a sumptuous coral ribbed tunic sweater with a wrap collar; short,
fringed wrap skirts and kilts; and what the designer calls a "stocking pant,"
which is a little more than tights and a little less than pants. George's
combination of gray flannel trousers and a gold sequin jacket for evening is
innovative.;    Randolph Duke;  Like many, many other designers, Randolph Duke
has succumbed to tartan fever -- particularly the Black Watch, which he uses
to create kilt skirts, split to the waist in front. Much more wearable is a
series of coats that reverse from gray flannel to metallic-finish plastic in
bright red, green or gold.  </TEXT>
