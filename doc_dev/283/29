   Amid tears and grief, thousands of people who
have died of AIDS were memorialized Saturday in ceremonies centered
on a huge quilt made by friends and family members of the victims.
   ``One of the most important things we get here today is the
strength and sense of community we can feel, and the knowledge that
this terrible disease affects everyone,'' said Cleve Jones,
director of the Names Project.
   Jones, 34, is the founder of the San Francisco-based
commemorative project, which involved making a huge fabric quilt
that was spread out on the Ellipse, south of the White House.
   The quilt, five times larger than when it was displayed here
last year, contains 8,288 handmade panels, each in memory of a
single person or group of people who have died of AIDS since 1981.
   Each of the panels measures three feet by six feet and all 50
states and a dozen foreign countries are represented. The panels
are made from a variety of fabrics and many are elaborately
decorated. The 375,000-square-foot quilt is bisected by walkways.
   While hundreds of people walked among the panels on the sunny,
chilly morning, volunteers read the names of thousands of AIDS
victims.
   One of the 495 volunteer readers was scheduled to be Kitty
Dukakis, wife of the Democratic presidential candidate. But her
appearance was canceled because her flight to Washington later
Saturday was delayed.
   Jones began the Names Project in 1986 after a friend died of
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Since then, it has blossomed into a nationwide project and the
quilt has been on a 20-city tour in the past 18 months. The quilt
includes the names of about one-fifth of the approximately 42,000
Americans known to have died of AIDS since 1981.
   ``It's a very beautiful thing, but it's built on corpses,''
Jones said. ``We've learned from the quilt that country is filled
with good, kind, decent people who understand how to respond, who
understand that this is affecting all people, regardless of their
race, background of sexuality.''
   Jones said panels are still being accepted, although he said
organizers haven't decided how many more panels to add to the
quilt. More than 10,000 have been made, and panels not added to the
quilt were on display around the city in smaller quilts.
   One of the visitors was Lillian Mello, of San Jose, Calif. Her
23-year-old son, Patrick, died last Christmas Eve.
   With tears in her eyes, she wrote on a blank panel of the quilt:
``I pray that mothers and fathers will love and stand by their sons
and daughters even when they don't understand or accept their
lifestyle.'' She signed it: ``A mother who's glad she did.''
   Two of the readers were Mayer and Pat Levy of St. Louis, whose
31-year-old son died last year.
   ``We're doing this in memory of our son _ to help others,'' Levy
said tearfully, noting the quilt would help parents ``relieve their
grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed away.''
   Others, like Chris Bates of Washington, D.C. simply wept.
   ``I knew all of these people in New York, San Francisco and
Washington,'' Bates said between sobs. ``They were my
contemporaries. I'm not 40 yet and all I talk about now is death _
my grandmother talks about death _ it's not right.''
