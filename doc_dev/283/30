   Leona Tennyson, whose prized quilt trails
an Australian company in the race to be the world's largest, donned
a combat helmet as she joined the governor in declaring
good-natured ``war'' on her stitching rival.
   ``The fabric of our state is on trial here,'' Gov. George Sinner
said Friday in a brief speech on the Capitol mall that provoked
frequent laughs from about 40 onlookers.
   Among them was Tennyson, wearing a camouflage jacket and
olive-green Army helmet with the legend, ``Battle of the Quilts _
Gen. Tennyson.''
   ``This quilt represents the stuff _ or the stuffing _ that our
people are made of,'' Sinner said. ``When it comes to quilts, we in
North Dakota don't cotton to having the wool pulled over our eyes
by Australia.''
   For months, Tennyson has supervised the assembling of the
9,000-square-foot quilt, which is intended to mark North Dakota's
100th birthday next year.
   More than 7,000 people were involved in making parts of the
quilt, which contains material from all 53 North Dakota counties
and is so large it was brought to a news conference in a moving van.
   The Guinness Book of World Records certified the quilt in March
as the world's largest. David Boehm, American editor for the book,
said Friday its size was recorded as 9,495 square feet.
   However, an Australian quilting company, Hobbytex of Bracken
Ridge in Queensland province, soon weighed in with a quilt
measuring almost 200 square feet larger, Boehm said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   Tennyson says her quilt will be expanded in time to beat the
Guinness book's initial publication deadline in July.
   Sinner compared the quilt contest to the America's Cup yacht
race between the United States and Australia.
   Then he added: ``North Dakota's quilt makers are set to do
battle. They are quilters, not quitters. Even Crocodile Dundee
can't get the best of this crew.''

   The double-breasted black and gray pinstripe
suit Rusty Fuller picked to wear for his high school graduation
might not be in the height of fashion now, but the suit is a family
tradition for graduation.
   Fuller graduated Friday night in the same suit his brother,
father and uncle wore during high school graduations dating back to
1938.
   Fuller said he felt obligated and honored to wear the suit
because he shares middle names with his uncle Virgil, who died in
Germany during World War II.
   Virgil Fuller was the first to wear the suit _ at graduation
from Barnard High School in Barnard, Mo., in 1938. Then Fuller's
father, Cleo, wore the suit at his Barnard High School graduation
in 1949.
   Fuller's older brother, Randy, wore the suit at graduation in
Enid 14 years ago.
   Will the tradition continue?
   Fuller doesn't think so. He says the suit that still looks new
after 50 years probably will be retired now.
   ``Fifty is a good number to quit at,'' he said.
   But his father may have a few other ideas.
   ``We've got some grandsons,'' the elder Fuller said. ``You never
know....''
