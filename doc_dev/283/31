HIGH ENERGY AT SUN GALLERY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     These are high-energy paintings.;    "When I paint, I listen to rock 'n'
roll and opera and chew bubble gum," Haven explains.;    Her 14 paintings
burst with shapes in purple, yellow, pink, red and refrigerator-turquoise,
interspersed with white spaces for your eye to rest and catch its visual
breath. Think of the paintings like "Pride and Joy" as aerial views of
earth-side intersections with textured circles and rectangles hurtling toward
collision, veering off behind zig-zag boundaries, peeking out from behind
barricades.;    Or view them as painterly crazy quilts, forms stitched
together with zig-zag and dotted lines, punctuated by expressive calligraphy.
A prize-winning quilt maker, Haven is a former curator of the American Museum
of Quilts in San Jose. She incorporates fabric, paper and three-dimensional
objects into her work.;    Haven, 39, grew up in New York state, where she
earned a degree in art. She also studied at The California College of Arts and
Crafts, Dominican College and the Academy of Art College. She worked as a
graphic artist in Silicon Valley.;    She and her husband, Ken, a design
engineer, built a house in Fremont that incorporates a studio for her. For
their 10th anniversary in 1987, he gave her the gift of staying home to pursue
art full time. She sees acrylic painting as an extension of her other work in
graphics, quilting and raku pottery. Haven's paintings are in private and
corporate collections; this is her first gallery show.;    Working in a
different artistic discipline -- sculpted paper -- Krider's 12 pieces employ
many motifs that are remarkably resonant with Haven's paintings. Both
incorporate shapes with musical connotations, such as piano keys. Haven's
"Jukebox Saturday Night" looks like a platter-spinning nightspot sounded in
the '50s. And Krider's "Hurricane Sam" shows what happens when the improvised
melody line sweeps up orderly fences/piano keys at the bottom of a sculpture.
Tilting forms at the top of the piece look like pick-up sticks in a high
wind.;    Krider transforms plant fibers into handmade papers, which she then
sculpts into shapes that flow like fabric or are tightly controlled surfaces.
Some fold back upon themselves like soft origami -- or geological crevasses.
Others feature small ceramic heads, revealed or half-hiding. Many of the
colors combinations are striking, with deep turquoises played against warm
copper tones and hot pinks. A former Oakland resident, Krider recently moved
to Portland, Ore.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; "Abstract Paintings &amp; Sculpted Paper"
continues through July 27. The Sun Gallery is at 1015 E St., Hayward. Hours
are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday. For information, call (415)
581-4050.  </TEXT>
