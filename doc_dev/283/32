"It will come as a great surprise to many that 'Quilters' failed on Broadway," 
Laguna Playhouse executive director Richard Stein writes in his program note 
for the exquisite, all-female frontier musical that opened over the weekend at 
the Moulton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
I'll take Stein's word for it, but I really am not surprised. If anything, it's 
more surprising that "Quilters" got to Broadway in the first place. "Annie Get 
Your Gun," an Ethel Merman star vehicle meant for out-of-towners, is the sort 
of frontier musical that Broadway historically has favored. "Quilters" is not a 
show for out-of-towners. It has the appeal of the authentic. 
</P>
<P>
In the wrong hands, of course, "Quilters" could easily become quaint and 
languorous. Its episodic vignettes about pioneer times on the prairie, pieced 
together like the show's handmade quilts, have a tendency toward the elegiac. 
But this touching, funny, musically winning production has been directed by 
Teri Ralston and performed by its cast of seven women with a verve and lack of 
nostalgia that give it the unsentimental pulse of life. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else theatergoers plan to see between now and Dec. 16, when "Quilters" 
is scheduled to close, this is one show they should try not to miss. In fact, 
this latest version of the Molly Newman-Barbara Damashek musical is such an 
unassuming marvel of theatrical brilliance, it is hard to know what or whom to 
praise first. 
</P>
<P>
Shall we begin with the accomplished vocal talent of the wonderfully well-cast 
players -- Laura Pryzgoda, Lisa Picotte, Tricia Griffin, Karen McBride, Carolyn 
Miller, Colleen Dunn and Karen Angela -- or the considerable dramatic gifts 
that enable them to create individual portraits of pioneer women so 
gratifyingly different from each other? 
</P>
<P>
Or shall we begin with the feeling that the piece has captured an immense cycle 
of experience common to most, if not all, women -- pioneering or otherwise? 
"Quilters" deals with everything from menstruation and courtship to childbirth 
and mothering, aborting an unwanted fetus to surviving a beloved husband's 
death, being young and playful to growing old. 
</P>
<P>
The varied pacing of Ralston's direction-cum-choreography is not to be 
overlooked, nor Jacquie Moffett's and Doug Williamson's functional but 
evocative design: a towering windmill, a raised platform and a few 
strategically placed wooden beams -- all set against a quilt-like backdrop and 
bathed in Steven Wolff Craig's flesh-toned lighting. Note, too, the 
understatement of Marthella Randall's plain country costumes and the effective 
use of simple props. 
</P>
<P>
If the ensemble work looks as cohesive as the beautiful quilts that have gotten 
the characters through the good and bad times in their hard lives on the 
prairie, it is not for lack of practice: This cast has performed "Quilters" 
four times before under Ralston's direction. And plans are under way to do so 
again later this season in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ralston, who appeared with the original cast of "Quilters" at the Denver Center 
Theatre in 1983 and in a production at Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum in 1985, 
first directed the show with this cast at the Moulton in January, 1987. That 
was followed by an hourlong version in June, 1987, mounted at a national 
competition of the American Assn. of Community Theatres in Norman, Okla., where 
Ralston and company took top honors. 
</P>
<P>
They remounted the full-length show at the Moulton in May, 1988, to raise money 
to travel to Dundalk, Ireland, where "Quilters" competed in the 23rd annual 
International Community Theatre Festival. (The adjudicators awarded "Quilters" 
second prize, while the audience disagreed and voted it the top show.) 
</P>
<P>
Pryzgoda, who clearly has the outstanding voice of the ensemble, offers two of 
the production's musical highlights: a haunting rendition of "The Butterfly," 
which embellishes a particularly affecting tale about an orphan and the death 
of her young mother, and "Quiltin' and Dreamin' " which is part of a droll 
sketch about a plain Jane who catches the eye of the handsomest cowboy in the 
county (played with amusing panache by Dunn). 
</P>
<P>
The brightest of nearly two dozen numbers include the entire ensemble doing 
"Pieces of Lives," "The Windmill Song" (featuring Picotte and Angela), "Every 
Log in My House" and "Cornelia." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin also has a notable solo in "Green, Green, Green," as well as an 
affecting dramatic scene about a husband's death on the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Miller gives a fine, melancholy reading of an old-maid schoolteacher who can't 
have children, while Picotte provides an essential buoyancy throughout in a 
polished and energetic performance both as a singer and actor. Angela, though 
at times a bit shrill, brings off some of the sharpest moments of comedy as a 
clever scamp. And McBride has an anchoring presence as a pioneer matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the band lends vivid support not only as musical accompanists but 
also as sound-effects technicians creating the mood of the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Turnbull plays a variety of instruments from wind to percussion, along 
with Rocio Marron on fiddle, Cynthia Merrill on bass and Bob Hawkins on guitar 
and mandolin.
