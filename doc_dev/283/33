   The only common thread weaving through news about
menswear for next winter is that guys will still be wearing pants.
   And even then, the trousers displayed at shows ending Monday
ranged from fairly baggy to cigarette-style, with or without cuffs.
Besides classic blazer jackets with vents, toppers are usually
hooded toggle-buttoned duffel coats or puffy parkas.
   Otherwise, there's nearly as much romance and color to seduce
male dandies as you see in women's styles, from brocade to
rhinestone embroidery touches.
   The emphasis at Hermes was on incomparable silkscarf touches in
linings on dress tails or bathrobe loungewear. The house's famed
leather goods looked softer than ever in jodphur styles.
   Welsh designer Richard James went all-out for fantasy gear: bold
tartan combinations of bermuda shorts, ties, jackets and sequined
waistcoats worn with argyle socks or sweaters. His
sequined-snowflake pastel velvet jogging outfits were adorable.
   Balmain's offerings by Patrick Aubert included a range of
delectable colors and casual styles based on suits and separates in
all ranges of chocolate brown, plum, cinnamon and curry or mustard.
   The cashmere blazers in everything from robin's egg blue to
dusty rose and rust worn with paisley vests looked great for casual
wear teamed with charcoal or blue denim jeans.
   The Lanvin message was dubbed ``a new language of color'' by
Patrick Lavoix. Besides some sharp pinstripe or herringbone suits
in soft wools, there were color combinations like burgundy, violet
and rust shades with a dash of pine green, or mixes of greenish
gray, chartreuse, cassis, teal blue and raspberry in an outfit.
   Lavoix's splendid touches of brocade vests with black tuxedos
and lounging outfits in copper brocade would pep up any
conservative's wardrobe.
   Jean-Charles de Castelbajac's selections ranged from fringed
blanket lumberjack looks to startle Tonto right through soft plaid
pants sporting peplum wraps and trains. The epicene fashions that a
lady might covet also included full-skirted loden coats for a
citified Henry David Thoreau returning to nature.
   Claude Montana's clothes were often minimalist styles in petrol
blues, tobacco, sand shades in big duster-coats over casual,
tieless gabardine suits. More fun for sportswear would be the
brightly colored blazers with dark pants.
   Montana's evening wear would best be worn by the ``leather-bar''
set. Zombie-like, the models clomped around in all manner of
nailhead-studded black leather blousons with narrow pants, plus
some weird visored stiffened nylon-string caps
   Jean-Paul Gaultier put on a rousing show of fun featuring
red-nosed cartoon characters, the Gallic version of the Three
Stooges. They sometimes sported candleabra headgear sprouting
shaving brushes instead of candles or big egret feathers.
   Gaultier also threw in some real clothes, notably well-cut brown
and blue blazers and hooded duffels in ethnic-patterned fabrics.
   Yohji Yamamoto, the Japanese advocate of black, went in for a
lot more color this time in patchwork jackets teaming checks, glen
plaids, chevron and tweeds. Mossy green or brown shirts were in,
ties were out.
   Issey Miyake put on a show of low-keyed practical clothes
featuring plenty of puffy quilted windbreakers in ``wet'' or
``dry'' surface fabrics over corduroy pants and ground-grippers.
   The black evening wear featuring spencers or priests' collar
jackets emerged from a hole in the floor on models carrying roses
in a tango-rhythmed tribute to ``the dead and the dying,''
presumably a reference to victims of AIDS.
   Catherine Hamnett, English queen of laid-back styles for men and
women, came up with a good siena-brown redingote with velvet collar
as well as rust, mustard, caramel belted polo coats.
   The evening wear was a sparkly fireworks show based on black
dressy fabrics with red sequin and crystal trim _ the glitziest
number in an all-sequined bluejean-suit look with bomber jacket.
   The Yves Saint Laurent show by designer Bernard Sanz offered
true originality in wearable classics updated with new color
schemes and light, soft fabrics.
   His shades of silvery gray and creamy white should please anyone
from Minneapolis to Montreal. The handsome toggle-buttoned duffel
coats with knit caps topped jersey pants tucked into heavy cable
socks or corduroy bicycle knickers with black-laced beige suede
high-top shoes.
   The new fox or wolf-collared panther-spotted windbreakers with
contrasting quilted satin linings looked handsome over tweed
jackets, button-down corduroy shirts and lean pants. They turned up
in various shades of tobacco, curry and old gold, with flowered or
fruit ties and long fringed silk scarfs adding a festive touch.
