<HEAD>Global Influences At Week's Designer Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Buyers, reporters and others who swoon for
fashion found a variety of global influences at work during a
whirlwind jaunt through this week's designer shows in New York.
   American folk art inspired Bob Mackie's collection. Isaac
Mizrahi displayed an interest in China and tossed in some American
Indian elements. And Mary McFadden paid tribute to her recent
voyage to Venice.
   Martin Price, designer for the Giorgio di Sant'Angelo
collection, stayed closer to home, sticking to the late designer's
red hot sexy look.
   Louis dell'Olio, for Anne Klein, crossed time zones, blurring
distinctions between day and evening wear.
   Spurred on by ``the real men and women that forged the
wilderness,'' Mackie delivered up a collection that reeked of
Daniel Boone, with fringe leather vests, Indian blanket coats, and
short evening jackets embroidered with the Liberty Bell.
   Mackie's Americana influences included quilted skirts and
Pennsylvania Dutch quilt designs, but the elaborate gold beaded
headdresses with head-to-toe feathers, which Cher could wear with
equanimity, were Hollywood all the way.
   Announcing that he was ``encouraging men to take more liberties
with their style of dressing,'' Mizrahi Thursday night displayed a
gray cotton raincoat with a yellow alpaca lining.
   For those seeking to experiment gradually with fashion, there
was a richly colored bottle green silk padded blazer, an ash blue
silk trench coat and a suit with varying shades of orange.
   Mizrahi introduced twists on fashion such as a charcoal
double-breasted suit in wool jersey, a dressy white ruffled shirt
combined with a casual leather jacket and a gold brocade dinner
jacket with a bronze satin cardigan shirt.
   For women, Mizrahi was typically playful, with teeny skirts with
one button at the waist (``I call them placemats because that's
what they look like on the table'') and Indian-inspired fringe
ponchos with shawl dresses. Also, there were plenty of kimonos and
dressy ankle-length full skirts with Oriental embroidery.
   Continuing with his trademark color combinations, Mizrahi showed
a creamsicle alpaca and beaver pea coat with a pink cardigan
sweater.
   Meanwhile, dell'Olio introduced interchangeable, eminently
wearable pieces that work for day or night, a collection both basic
and elegant. His outfits were easy and monochromatic, in navy,
coffee, and magenta, in wool crepe, cashmere, and suede.
   For evening, dell'Olio showed luxurious tapestry, panne velvet
and damask in simple silhouettes.
   McFadden zeroed in on 16th century Venice, with lots of gold and
pewter metallic lace, metallic handpainted panne velvet and
embroidered velvet. Appliqued riding jackets, full-sleeved poet's
blouses and ankle-length slender evening gowns with double tiered
quilted jackets completed the look.
   The di Sant'Angelo collection, named ``Seduction,'' featured
bright colors on a parade of steadily smashing models swathed in
body-hugging gauze, chiffon, and mousseline. Bodysuits, bikinis,
unitards, and saris were among the sizzling looks.
