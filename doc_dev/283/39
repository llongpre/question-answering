<LEADPARA>  In the sunny kitchen of her Newark home, Liza Hocevar patiently awaits her
son's presence.;    "He told me that someday, when I least expected it, he
would come back and hold me tight," she whispered, her dark eyes gleaming with
tears. "I believe he will come back to me."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AIDS QUILT HELPS MOTHER MEND WOUNDS OF SON'S
DEATH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Hocevar's son, 28-year-old John August Macedo III, died of AIDS last
October. She still mourns his death, spending her days recounting final
moments spent with him and nursing the suffocating pains of grief that swell
in her chest.;    "I couldn't begin to describe what it's like to see your
handsome, strapping son turn into bones," she said as she fingered the holes
in her cloth place mats left by her son's smoldering cigarette ashes. "A lot
of people just don't realize the tragedy of AIDS until it happens to someone
you love.";    Now, five months after her son's death, Hocevar is picking up
needle and thread to mend the emotional wounds. She is one of several southern
Alameda County residents who will contribute to the Names Project AIDS
Memorial Quilt when it makes its first appearance in the county later this
month.;    The quilt, begun in 1985, is made of thousands of three-by-six-foot
panels, each a memorial to the life of someone who died of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. At last count, the quilt had 12,592 panels and weighed 14
tons. It has been displayed around the world.;    Besides providing a way to
express grief, the quilt points out the tragedy and urgency of the epidemic
and raises funds to help those living with AIDS, said Rosa Nanez-Cedillo, one
of the volunteers for the Oakland display.;    "It's hard to believe, but
there are still some people around here who don't want people to know their
son or loved one died of AIDS," Nanez-Cedillo said. (Nearly 1,000 of the 1,635
Alameda County residents diagnosed with AIDS have died of the disease.);   
Hocevar has unkind words for such people.;    "I have a friend who has a son
who died of AIDS, but she won't mention what he died of," she said. "This is a
disease. It has no eyes. It doesn't discriminate against anybody. I was proud
of my son. He had AIDS. He was gay. But we was a wonderful son who faced his
death with bravery and honor.";    Hocevar, who is part Spanish, said the
stigma attached to AIDS is especially prevalent among Hispanics.;    "In the
Hispanic community, that dumb machismo makes you blind," she said. "How can
you give birth to someone, then reject him when that child needs you the
most?";    But she had nothing but praise for the support she received from
neighbors and friends -- and the help Macedo got from local AIDS support
groups.;    "They helped me more than I ever thought possible. I saw so many
tender moments between my son and the volunteers," she recalled. "Toward the
end, they had to help him go to the bathroom, and they treated him with love
and dignity.";    Hocevar has chosen a country-western motif for the quilt
square honoring Macedo, who worked as a manager for a beverage distribution
company.;    "He loved country and western music and dancing. Before he died,
he picked out his favorite bolo tie and pair of boots to wear during his
funeral," she said.;    "I'm sure he's still doing the two-step in heaven.";  
  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt will be on
display March 22-24 at the Oakland Convention Center, 10th and Broadway. For
