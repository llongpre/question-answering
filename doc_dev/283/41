   The handmade national AIDS quilt, vandalized for
the first time in its three-year history, will be restored,
organizers said.
   Two teddy bears were cut from two of the four 12-foot-by-12-foot
sections of the quilt on display last week at the Hotel
Inter-Continental, said Jerry Suarez, chairman of the South Florida
Names Project.
   The group set up the display in the hotel mezzanine in
conjunction with the national conference of the Council on
Foundations.
   ``It was very difficult to explain how much this meant,'' said
AIDS activist Shelley Rappaport, who had sewed one of the bears on
for a friend who died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
``It's like, would someone walk up to the Vietnam War Memorial and
start scratching names off?''
   Scott Lago, head of display marketing for the national Names
Project, which made the memorial quilt, said sections of it have
been displayed 257 times around the world this year. But the quilt
had never been vandalized before, he said Monday.
   On Saturday, four sections of the quilt were to be taken down
after the conference, but on Friday another group meeting at the
hotel, the Club Connection, asked that the quilt sections be
removed.
   That group, which bills itself as a selective singles group,
considered the display ``ugly,'' said the hotel's resident manager,
Jurgen Dinger.
   A hotel employee then took down the quilt sections without
consulting management, Dinger said.
   Suarez found the quilt wadded up in a closet Saturday and he
discovered two teddy bears had been cut.
   ``It's not just a teddy bear,'' Ms. Rappaport said. ``It's the
only memorial I have. That's why it hurts so much.''
   The other teddy bear, wearing surgical gloves, had been cut from
the panel dedicated to Suarez's father, a doctor.
   ``It didn't just come off,'' Suarez said. ``You could tell
someone took scissors to it.''
   Both teddy bears will be sewn back on, Ms. Rappaport said.
