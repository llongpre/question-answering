<LEADPARA>  QUILTS are the medium of the largest community arts project in the world --
the Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, based in San Francisco.;    Started in
1987, each square memorializes the name of a person who has died of AIDS.
There are more than 14,000 squares, says Debra Resnik, director of display for
the Names Project. "We have displays all over the country and all over the
world at any given time," she says. "Groups or institutions apply to us for
displays."  </LEADPARA>
