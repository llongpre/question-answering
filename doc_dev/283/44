   Delicate threads are linking the affluent suburbs
of Chicago and the poverty-ridden slums of India, in a project
started by an Indian social worker.
   Pushpika Freitas, 31, describes her plan to market the clothing
and other handiwork of her native land as ``capitalism with a
conscience.''
   ``What we're doing is not only selling products and helping
people in India, but also educating some of the people here about
the different conditions there,'' said Ms. Freitas in a recent
interview.
   ``There's the whole aspect of brotherhood and sisterhood,
identifying with people on the other side of world who live in very
bad conditions but would really want to change their lives or
improve themselves.''
   Ms. Freitas, who divides her time between Bombay and Chicago,
founded the non-profit group called ``MarketPlace: Handwork of
India'' in 1986, to provide a marketing outlet in the United States
for the handmade crafts and clothing items.
   Since then, the volunteer agency has promoted the sale of about
$20,000 worth of goods in the United States, mostly through homes
and churches in Chicago's northern suburbs.
   Its first major experiment with a retail shop came this year
through Nomad's, an import handcraft store in suburban Evanston.
   More than $2,500 worth of the brightly colored patchwork and
intricately embroidered cotton clothing, bags and table mats has
been sold since the items went on display May 14.
   ``It's gone very well ... and we intend to continue what has
been a good relationship,'' said Catharine Cole, Nomad's owner.
   About 45 percent to 50 percent of the money from the sales goes
back to the Indian cooperatives that make the items. The rest
covers shipping fees, duties and promotional and office expenses.
   Ms. Freitas said Indian women who work as domestic servants earn
only about $15 to $20 a month for working 8 to 10 hours a day, 7
days a week. Through the cooperatives, she said, they can double
their earnings while working at home.
   Ms. Freitas has been involved with the cooperatives since she
returned to her native Bombay in 1979 after receiving her master's
degree in sociology from Chicago's De Paul University, where her
husband is a political science professor.
   She found women in Bombay to be ``the poorest of the poor,
unskilled and uneducated.''
   But she also found them motived to keep their families going.
   ``Being a woman, I empathized with their situation and wanted to
do something about this,'' she said.
   So in 1980, Ms. Freitas founded a patchwork cooperative with
three women in Bombay's Golibar slum district who made quilts,
cushion covers and garments.
   Now, the patchwork center provides work for 35 women who pick up
materials and instructions and work at home on a piece-work basis.
   There also are three other workshops employing 30 poor women and
handicapped men. Those workshops are a sewing shop, a hand-block
fabric printing shop and a silk screen shop, where workers are
trained to make stationery and ornamental paper.
   In 1985, Ms. Freitas helped launch a non-profit coalition of
cottage industries called SHARE, or Support the Handicapped
Rehabilitation Effort. It now works with about 25 cooperatives
around India, helping them with professional advice on sales and
marketing.
   ``All these things are important, otherwise these programs are
like charity under a different name,'' Ms. Freitas said. ``It's
teaching a man to fish rather than providing the fish.''
   The cooperatives produce goods like flowing caftain dresses,
needlepoint belts, embroidered blouses and stationery sets for
export.
   Many shirts and skirts go for $16, and the most expensive items
are huge quilts that cost $200 to $250.
   Ms. Freitas plans to introduce a mail order catalog by next
year. She acknowledges that it's been hard to interest major
retailers who are looking for bulk orders and uniform designs, but
she believes in her project.
   ``I am convinced that the products can really take off here in
the United States ... and make some significant changes ... in
India,'' she said.
