<LEADPARA>  IF YOU can't understand the appeal of American country furniture and
accessories, a chat with artist Bob Timberlake soon sets you straight.;   
"It's a feeling of a time when a grandfather made a chest for his grandson to
hold his treasures, like dried leaves, or when a grandmother made a quilt for
her granddaughter when she got married. It's made with such depth of passion,
love and affection that it comes through in the gift," says Timberlake, whose
realist paintings have been compared to Andrew Wyeth's. "Each gift was
cherished and passed along to another daughter and it was kept and polished
and savored and loved."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Timberlake, 54, a man of many words, knows well the feelings engendered by
those hand-crafted items. In the 4,000-square-foot, three-story home and
studio he built from an 1809 log barn in Lexington, N.C., he has surrounded
himself with a lifetime of acquisitions including "almost 100 quilts, 35 birch
bark canoes, 500 duck decoys and a lot of antiques and things I've loved and
cherished and collected . . . I've got wing chairs covered with my fabric on
rock floors and beautiful quilts hanging on log walls.";    The new Bob
Timberlake furniture and accessories collection was inspired by these
furnishings and Timberlake's own strong feelings of a time "when a father
truly did pick out a piece of wood with burl for a chest and made it to
last.";    The 100-plus pieces in this new line -- a collaboration between
Timberlake and Lexington Furniture Industries -- are priced from $295 for a
Windsor-style dining chair to $5,350 for a leather-covered sofa. Timberlake is
promoting the collection with personal appearances at seminars today and
Sunday at Bay Area Macy's stores.;    Describing the line as "an adaptation of
folk art, crafts and craftsmanship," Timberlake is quick to mention the people
behind some of the designs, particularly "Aunt Sally" and Fred Craver, as well
as his memories of them.;    The rugs made by "Aunt Sally Parnell, who turned
104 last month and is still weaving every day," inspired Timberlake, who
lovingly describes them as ones "I took my first footsteps on and my children
took their first footsteps on." She made them on a 200-year-old loom which her
mother taught her to use at the age of four.;    The 83-year-old Craver is
regarded as one of the finest craftsmen in the country by Timberlake and
"everybody who knows him. Very few people know of him because everybody around
here bought up everything he made before anyone else saw it.";    Over the
past decade, Timberlake says he has talked with four or five furniture
manufacturers about "doing one thing or another, but nothing ever was quite
right." He is pleased that his long-awaited collaboration is with a firm in
his hometown. "We have 17,000 people here in town," he says. "Who I'm not kin
to, my wife is kin to. To work with people I grew up . . . gives me personal
pride.";    Among the accessories in his collection is one piece that affected
Timberlake's life -- a small reproduction of the Pennsylvania Dutch dowry
chest that won him, at age 14, first place in the Ford Motor Company's
national industrial arts competition.;    Timberlake is quite proud to be the
first Southerner to win that competition and quickly names his other
Southerner "firsts," including his exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C., as well as being "the first Southern artist to do a United
States postage stamp design." Timberlake designed the 1980 Christmas stamp and
two more since. "Not many artists are asked to do that," he boasts, mentioning
that other artists include Jamie Wyeth, the late Grandma Moses and Norman
Rockwell.;    One of the reasons Timberlake takes so much delight in his
success as an artist is because he didn't pursue that career full-time until
1970. Prior to that he worked in family-owned businesses and painted only as a
hobby. Inspired by a 1965 Life magazine profile on Andrew Wyeth, he sought the
artist out in 1969. Wyeth, among others, urged him to follow his instincts and
paint, which he did.;    Of the furniture venture, he says, "Whether it sounds
stupid or not, I'd be doing this even if there were no monetary return for it.
It's like sharing your paintings -- it's the opportunity to do what you want
most in your life."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Bob Timberlake will make a personal
appearance and participate in free seminars on creating country style in your
home with Jean LemMon,  editor of Country Home magazine, from 2 to 3 p.m.
today at Macy's, Hillsdale Mall, San Mateo and from 2 to 3 p.m. Sunday at
Macy's, Valley Fair Shopping Center, Santa Clara.  </TEXT>
