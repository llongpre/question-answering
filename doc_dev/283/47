   The Smithsonian Institution said it will
include several panels of the 750-by-500-foot AIDS quilt in its
collection documenting the history of the disease.
   The quilt panels will be added to the Museum of American
History's Division of Medical Sciences.
   The 3-by-6-foot panels were made by individuals to commemorate
the deaths of infants, brothers, sisters, parents and their
children, friends and assorted celebrities, including entertainers
Rock Hudson and Liberace. More than one-fifth of the approximately
42,000 Americans who died of AIDS since June 1981 are represented
on the quilt.
   The panels will join other objects, graphics and educational
materials in the collection documenting the medical and social
history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Cleve Jones, executive director of the NAMES project that
produced the quilt, said Kitty Dukakis, wife of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, had agreed to participate in
ceremonies marking display of the quilt this Saturday and Sunday in
the capital.
   Some 8,288 panels will be laid out on the Ellipse, an open area
behind the White House, and the remainder will be on display at
other points in the capital.
   Once on display, the quilt will measure 375,000 square feet
interspersed with five miles of walkway and 11 miles of trimming.
   Invitations had been extended to the major presidential
candidates and their wives but ``the (George) Bush campaign said
they were busy,'' Jones said.
   The quilt, which began in 1986 when Jones made the first panel
for a friend of his who died of AIDS, has quadrupled in size _ from
1,920 to 8,800 panels _ since its first display in the capital last
year.
   A national tour of the quilt in 20 cities raised $500,000 for
AIDS charities and resulted in quilt-making workshops.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., said he hoped publicity about the
quilt would move members of Congress to complete action on
legislation currently in conference committee in Congress designed
to aid research and AIDS victims.
