   Borrowing from the ski slopes, the riding ring, the
great outdoors or the bedroom, splashy ready-to-wear styles for
next fall are heavily influenced by active sportswear or fetching
lingerie styles.
   The opening of the East also was celebrated during shows last
week in folkloric Russian or Central European looks called
``International Ethnic'' by Women's Wear Daily.
   South-of-the-border and African animal-print themes inspired
other clothes that were happily more wearable than costume-like.
   The main younger silhouette is usually a leggy form clad in
colorful tights, cigarette-slim trousers or stretch stirrup pants a
la St. Moritz.
   Sometimes a miniskirt or tunic tops the tights, but fitted
jackets, redingotes and swirly babydoll toppers add to looks that
go from flippy to top-heavy.
   Th runways ran riot with drawstring parkas or fur-lined anoraks
with hoods. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel even dressed up his evening
wear with shimmering satin quilted ski jackets.
   Castelbajac, who always does bright sportswear-based clothes,
was still a winner with his handsome mohair-hooded greatcoats, his
primary color parkas or duffels, his tunic-and-tights knitwear.
   As sportswear and outerwear became indoor wear, underwear also
took a flirtatious bow in cocktail clothes, with wasp-waisted lacy
merry widow looks at Lacroix, Hanae Mori, Lecoanet-Hemant and
elsewhere.
   And then there was the super appeal of the ethnic clothes. They
looked great as done by the top creators: Ungaro, Lacroix, Romeo
Gigli and Yves Saint Laurent.
   Saint Laurent, who showed the first great Russian rich-ethnic
styles in 1976, was in a hospital suffering from mental and
physical exhaustion, missing his opening. But his bouncy, quilted
and flowered new versions of the happy peasant look were a charming
update.
   Watch for shimmering velvet-printed long skirts and bright
quilted toppers shot with lame threads, moire skirts and belted
tunics in neon-hot colors, plus tassels, sequins and
``passementerie'' ribbon decor.
   But styles marched right back from the 1960s as well, updated
with elegant thigh-high suede or flower-printed boots at Ungaro
teamed with some of the stretch pants and mini-tunics.
   With eye-catching tricolored lean tunics or minis with tights
and the high boots, plus clothes in big Mondrian-inspired blocks of
color, many were talking about Pierre Cardin's ghost hovering over
it all.
   Cardin, whose avant-garde ideas of the 1960s still seem to work
in the leg-baring 1990s, is in fact alive and doing so well he
doesn't even need to give a ready-to-wear show.
   In the pyramid or trapeze coat line, look for the basic shape
and fabulous fabrics at Montana, a master at styling this
silhouette.
   For the best redingote, look to Dior, where designer Gianfranco
Ferre gave the house refinement and new kick with superb cuts and
hot reds like the ``pink'' riders' coats.
   Another popular coat was the full-skirted or slimmer trench,
which turned into a dress at Chanel.
   Day wear was not totally for the leggy, as many designers showed
slim pants and a few paraded fullish longer skirts. Daytimes were
sometimes festively dressed up with lame and sparkles or touches of
satin and chiffon in blouses in outfits that might pass at a
liberal office before the wearer leaves for the cocktail hour.
   Evening wear was one big fete, with acres of passementerie,
gold-braided ``galloons,'' jeweled and velvet embroidery. Minxy
decollete styles and bubble dresses were tempered with plenty of
little black dresses in all kinds of soft fabrics and silhouettes.
   Color schemes for next fall run the gamut from subdued
chocolate, khaki, mustard, camel, gray and wine to neon pinks or
greens. Brights are a big hit as Paris is seeing red: with flame
red, crimson, orange, fuchsia and cyclamen leading the way.
   Little touches make the difference in Paris fashion. You can
look for all kinds of silky print shawls and fringed stoles, velvet
berets or pillboxes, chain belts with big cabochon stones, chunky
bracelets, necklaces and drop earrings to dress up a wardrobe.
   After the marathon week of ready-to-wear with at least 100 shows
under tents raised in the Louvre's Cour Carre courtyard and other
locations around town, Paris was being touted as the world capital
of fashion.
   Now that top Japanese, Italian and English creators like
Katherine Hamnett and John Galliano have defected to show in Paris,
the big question is whether Americans will hop on the bandwagon.
   Jacques Mouclier, president of the French Fashion Federation and
Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, said a $77 million underground
fashion complex is planned under the Tuileries gardens near the
Louvre.
