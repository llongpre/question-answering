<LEADPARA>  MOST people think big when they plan unusual home decorating schemes. Marilyn
Green started small, with buttons.;   She has sofa pillows outlined with shiny
"pearlies," and picture frames lined with sturdy wooden "toggles." Whimsical
fabric landscapes sparkle with tiny "diminutives." And big, colorful
"sew-throughs" decorate baskets of coiled fabric.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Green, of Menlo Park, became hooked on buttons as a toddler growing up in
Michigan. According to her baby book, "button" was the first word out of her
mouth.;   Green knew she would eventually write a book about buttons. But the
former reference librarian had no idea she would spend three years researching
off-beat bits of button lore for "The Button Lover's Book" (Chilton, $17.95).;
  Green's book comes at a time when designers and decorators are stitching
their own little button brigade. Shirt buttons have turned from plain pearl to
shell, wood and metal. Pillows and slipcovers are being trimmed with buttons.
And stylish metal button covers have even shown up in mail-order clothing
catalogs.;   "The Button Lover's Book" ranges from the basics of buying,
selecting and sewing buttons to odd entries of button trivia. Did you know,
for example, that button-down shirts were invented to keep collars from flying
in the faces of British polo players? Or that police are called "cops" because
of the big copper buttons that once adorned London bobbies' uniforms?;   "The
Button Lover's Book" has a short history section, telling how buttons came
into being as ornamental baubles -- and how buttonholes followed several
centuries later.;   Green tells how to use buttons on stuffed animals and
dolls, and how to make button jewelry and button toys. She also gives detailed
advice on cleaning and storing buttons. And she tells how to make buttons --
with everything from avocado pits to acrylic modeling compounds.;   No wonder
Green's friends call her the Button Queen. But she denies the crown. She says
she's a radical upstart in the button-collecting community. Instead of
searching out rare antiques, she treasures all sorts of buttons. "I like what
snobbish collectors call 'common' buttons," she says with an impish grin. "I
like the fact that everybody touches them every day.";   For her Christmas
decorations, Green dumps nine pounds of red and green buttons into a huge red
straw basket on her coffee table. Pale red shirt buttons collide with velvet
green circlets. Ordinary green plastic buttons clatter against a red
rhinestone wonder set in silver filigree. "I love the sound they make when you
swirl your hand through them," says Green. "It reminds me of the seashore,
when the waves rush over the shells.";   Usually, Green doesn't play favorites
with her buttons. She sorts them according to color. But she does keep a
special box for hearts and stars. For Christmas, she strung a glittering
collection of star-shaped buttons on clear plastic thread. Then she scattered
the tiny galaxy over the angels and candles on her mantle.;   Green thinks
everyone should show off the buttons they love best. That's why she never
accepts offers to search through family button boxes for treasures. "People
shouldn't give these heirlooms away," she says. "They could be from your
grandmother's wedding dress!";   Green displays her heirloom buttons on a
patchwork quilt. Each square frames a keepsake. A big "A" from her grandmother
Alexanderine dominates one square. Another holds metallic green clams bought
in Russia. Three white Scottie dogs on red embroidered leashes prance through
a small dark square. In another, an opalescent disc hangs like a pale moon in
a snowy sky over a small house button. "I love these buttons so much I didn't
want to put them on clothes," says Green. "When I find something I can't give
up, I add another square. The project is never finished.";   Some of the
special buttons Green is willing to part with go on Christmas presents. The
gifts she made this year are all explained in her book. Green herself drew
hundreds of charming illustrations to clarify her instructions.;   In the
author's pile of button-gilded presents, there are baseball caps for her niece
and nephew with buttons sewn all over the top. There's a felt cuff bracelet
studded with brass buttons, each stamped with a different motto. A fish-shaped
pillow is decorated with fresh- and saltwater mother-of-pearl buttons (Green's
book tells how to spot the difference: Freshwater pearlies are more chalky,
saltwater more iridescent).;   Farther down in the gift pile, there's a
punk-looking sweatshirt with dark, chunky buttons strewn across silk-screened
graffiti. But there's also a romantic felt heart glittering with tiny buttons
for Green's husband, Drew McCalley.;   The couple's fat Christmas stockings
show how easily Green uses buttons for completely different effects. There's a
sophisticated red stocking with alternating rows of white lace and pearl
buttons. The other stocking sports the riotously colorful, childlike design of
a tree. Wooden buttons cover the tree's brown felt trunk. Common shirt buttons
tack on abstract felt fruits. A quaint butterfly-shaped button hovers nearby.;
  As a child, Green made red felt Christmas coasters and stockings covered
with buttons and glitter with the help of her grandmother. "I guess I'm still
doing the same thing," says Green, with an amused smile. "Only now, I don't
use pinking shears."  </TEXT>
