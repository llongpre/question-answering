   From dressy ski parkas for evening at Chanel to
silk-clad jockeys at Dior, designers are showing luxury
ready-to-wear fashions for winter inspired by sportswear.
   Chanel's designer Karl Lagerfeld on Monday introduced sporty
dress-up outfits sizzling with new primary colors. The current
Chanel silhouette demands slim legs.
   ``Lagerfeld has liberated women, with wonderful cuts and new
colors,'' said Lynn Manulis, owner of Martha's boutiques. ``I think
it's great.''
   Lagerfeld pushed his New Age minis to the extreme and abandoned
skirts altogether in some outfits, announcing in his program that
``skirts are on their way out.''
   His jackets were superb. Lagerfeld showed some wonderful hot-red
tweeds heavily piped in red, white and blue galloon braiding along
with dressy bright cashmere jackets with black chenille and gold
baroque embroidery.
   The ski-slope idea for dressing up was fine in puffy royal blue
or red satin quilted boleros or anoraks paired with chenille
stretch pants. The jackets bore the trademark Chanel gold buttons.
   At Dior, Gianfranco Ferre took his audience on a trip to the
racetrack or back to the l9th century in dandy-coachmen's styles.
Jockeys' silks teamed with jodhpurs and boots and bicolored taffeta
stoles are aimed at the winner's circle.
   Ferre's day wear often featured beautifully cut gray flannel
redingotes or riding coats, dressed up with Ferre's favorite top
hat for the carriage trade.
   They made nice coat dresses served up with satin stocks at the
necks or teamed with lean long pants for elegant suits.
   Ferre was seeing crimson red everywhere: as linings for capes
and underskirts in fitted suits, in belted full coats over pencil
pants, and as flared pyramid shortie coats worn with nude-shaded
tights with high heels.
   And he brought back full long skirts as a wonderful way to be
comfortable at home, in a gored, buttoned up ottoman carmine silk
skirt with a ribbed knit body stocking, or beautiful gold or ruby
satin sashed lounging-coat tea gowns, split over matching tapered
pants.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer's lively show uncaged his wild-animal
themes, and nobody does it better than Scherrer. His fitted
shimmering jackets stitched like alligator patterns or printed like
snakeskin were handsome.
   His blond daughter and star model, Laetitia, paraded with her
new adopted stray dog, a huge black Great Dane looking elegantly
dignified.
   As everywhere else, Scherrer used some sportswear to advantage,
in duffel-coat styles fastened with thongs and bobbins or chain
bits, in shiny, quilted and hooded toppers in hot colors. Paisley
was another plus in slim pants and fitted jackets.
   Hanae Mori, celebrating her 35 years in fashion with a
retrospective exhibition of her work at the Pavillon des Arts, gave
her winter styles a rejuvenating shot in the arm.
   Her fitted leather suits with skirts way above the knee, knits
in cloud or black and white patterns and fuzzy Mongolian short
coats combined youthful appeal with sophistication.
   She also used some current favorite Paris themes for her boxy or
fitted suits with long jackets in tapestry weaves with elegant fur
trimmings in chinchilla jackets or fox hoods.
   Also on Monday, it was announced that Yves Saint Laurent was
hospitalized at the American Hospital for what a doctor described
as ``intellectual exhaustion,'' and would be unable to attend his
show Wednesday. Saint Laurent, 53, had been advised to rest for
several weeks, said Dr. Michael Prendeville.
