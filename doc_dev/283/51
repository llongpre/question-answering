   With hooker styles at Angelo Tarlazzi and wild
lampshade hoop skirts at Thierry Mugler, some fashion shows failed
to resemble their purpose _ ready-to-wear.
   But with all the craziness in Thursday's shows for next winter,
there existed quiet and sporty moments at houses like Cerruti,
Castelbajac and even Comme des Garcons.
   Japanese Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons concentrated on
drawstring-parka looks and bubbly silhouettes. Coupled with minis
or long skirts, the bunchy parkas or anoraks were often in black,
white or lame, with the drawstrings all over the place.
   Kawakubo's new discovery was ``bonded'' or unwoven fabrics with
a light, shimmery quality, sometimes crimped, or in gray with a
mosaic or snakeskin quality.
   They looked appealing in shades of brown, gold or caramel or
spring colors like robin's-egg blue. And some iridescent velvety
fabrics were striking for dressier moments.
   Shapeless tunics, dangling extra sleeves and bunching in odd
places were the usual Kawakubo trademarks that appeal to her many
fans in Japan.
   Yohji Yamamoto went in for red and black in a big way and
offered fun if somewhat complicated styles in bicolored outfits
with petal-like skirts under cute fake fur wraps.
   He also used curvy bell shapes to advantage in longer-skirted
models, with quilted skirts and sleeves paired with fitted bodices.
The bubbly skirts and tops gave it all a ``modern-medieval'' look.
   In sexier ready-to-wear, Angelo Tarlazzi showed a lot of
provocative skin-tight knit minis in hot colors or navy, some with
draping and buttons at the skirt with hems way up to high thigh.
   Topped with loose little jackets and worn with long satin
shirts, these looked reasonably wearable by the younger set.
   His late-day clothes in stretch satins and crepes featuring
quilted satin hearts on derrieres and busts and his draped sizzling
satin body-hugging numbers were tarty in an echo of what Ungaro did
several seasons ago. They looked zingy on the runway but couldn't
be safely worn by polite society.
   Jean-Charles de Castelbajac had some great ideas in the sporty
line, starting with his huge mohair tartan overcoats topping tiny
bright minis and tights all in his preferred primary colors.
   Bright new mohair and ribbon-woven fabrics mixed with quilted
leather made for interesting jackets topping leather shorts with
colorful tights.
   A witty feature was the rolled window-blind panels on coats worn
over shortie kilts. There were rafts of duffel coats, full shorts
bunched at the waist and some striking burnoose coats with hoods.
   Unforgettable were the vast trapeze coats in plaid on the
outside and white fake fur linings turned out to make cape collars.
   ``This special double-faced plaid fabric especially made in
southwest France is basically what the old French concierges'
bedroom slippers are made of,'' said Castelbajac.
   Nino Cerruti kept his show relatively quiet with soft and loose
hooded duster coats over narrow jersey pants, and some good dark
windowpane plaids _ in blazers over lean draped asymmetrical skirts
or jumpsuits with full pants.
   In the late-day line he stuck to things like pants in shades of
bronze Lurex split up and flapping to show the whole leg, and a
raft of sexy black ``tuxedo'' outfits, some with shorts, others
with long skirts and backless.
   Thierry Mugler ended the day with several shows so crowded with
waiting journalists and buyers there were near-riots. His main
theme as usual was slightly kinky sex.
   This time he flaunted it with lots of black vinyl tight pants or
tiny minis with flared hems and neon colors in late-day dresses.
The ``ball gowns'' had lampshade hoop skirts, cut very high up
front.
   Aside from some beautifully fitted long jackets and ankle-length
coats with full skirts, there wasn't much to wear on the street.
   One spectactor remarked, ``Those hoops would be hard to fit into
a taxi.''
