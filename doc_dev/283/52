<HEAD>ATLANTA: get sick.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Common ground. What is leadership if not to present help in a
time of crisis?
   So I have met you at the point of challenge.
   In Jay, Maine, where paperworkers were striking for fair wages.
In Greenfield, Iowa, where family farmers struggle for a fair
price. In Cleveland, Ohio, where working women seek comparable
worth. In McFarland, Calif., where the children of Hispanic
farmworkers may be dying from a poisoned land _ dying in clusters
with cancer. In the AIDS hospice in Houston, Texas, where the sick
support one another, too often rejected even by their loved ones.
   Common ground. America is not a blanket, woven from one thread,
one color, one cloth. When I was a child in South Carolina, and
momma couldn't afford a blanket, she didn't complain and we didn't
freeze. Instead she took pieces of old cloth _ patches _ wool,
silk, gaberdeen, crockersack _ only patches, barely good enough to
shine your shoes with. But they didn't stay that way long. With
sturdy hands and strong cord, she sewed them together into a quilt,
a thing of power, beauty and culture. Now we must build a quilt
together.
   Farmers, when you seek fair prices, you are right _ but your
patch isn't big enough. Workers, when you seek fair wages, you are
right _ but your patch isn't big enough. Women, when you seek
comparable worth and pay equity, you are right _ but your patch
isn't big enough. Mothers, when you seek Head Start, prenatal care
and day care, you are right _ but your patch isn't big enough.
Students, when you seek scholarships, your are right _ but your
patch isn't big enough.
   Blacks and Hispanics, when we fight for civil rights, we are
right _ but our patch isn't big enough. Gays and lesbians, when you
fight against discrimination and for a cure for AIDS, you are right
_ but your patch isn't big enough. Conservatives and progressives,
when you fight for what you believe, you are right _ but your patch
isn't big enough.
   But don't despair. When we bring the patches together, make a
quilt, and turn to each other and not on each other, we the people
always win. George Bush will be off to private life, leave
Washington on a one-way ticket _ a super saver.
   We stand at the end of a long, dark night of reaction. We stand
tonight united in the commitment to a new direction. For almost
eight years, we have been led by those who view social good coming
from private interest, who viewed public life as a means to
increase private wealth. They have been prepared to sacrifice the
common good of the many to satisfy the private interests of a few.
   We believe in a government that is the tool of democracy in
service to the public health, education, affordable housing, not an
instrument of aristocracy in search of private wealth. We believe
in government by, of and for the people. We must now emerge into a
new day and a new direction.
