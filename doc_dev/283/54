   Italian designers are predicting a short
winter for next year _ at least where hemlines are concerned.
   Not only is the average skirt a good three inches above the
knee, but the fall-winter 1990-91 ready-to-wear collections being
presented in Milan this week are full of bermudas and short shorts,
items usually reserved for the warmer months.
   What was a daring step in the late 1980s, when for the first
time in 20 years the ``moda Milanese'' hiked hemlines above the
knee, has become a way of life for the fashionable woman in the new
decade.
   Most fashion followers agree the latest Gianni Versace
mini-skirt, which almost reaches the navel, is just too short, but
at the same time Versace is the clearest statement that short
hemlines are here to stay.
   Once women have agreed to bare their thighs it is easy to get
them to wear shorts in the winter too.
   The new winter bermudas and shorts are loose and sporty, usually
in corduroy or light wool jersey worn with dark or printed
stockings and comfortable walking shoes.
   In general the latest ``moda Milanese'' is pert rather than
sexy, with a heavy accent on sportswear.
   Gone are the tailored city suits and elegant coats of past
seasons, to be replaced by sweatsuits, sport jackets, parkas, down
and duffel coats and loads of knitwear from cozy cardigans,
pullovers and sweaterdresses to the brand new all-knit jumpsuit.
   Colors range from the browns and reds of autumn leaves, to the
icy beige, green and blue pastel shades of a winter landscape.
   Three of the designers who showed there new collections here
Monday _ Krizia, Missoni and Byblos _ are longtime experts in the
field of chic sportwear.
   Krizia proposes a soft and casual look. Shoulders are natural,
hemlines brief and waistlines loose.
   Jackets tend to be oversized with huge shawl collars, rounded
hemline and drawstring waist. In the coat department Krizia offers
cozy bathrobe coats with silk cord monk belts.
   For mountain fun or cold city days Krizia offers a series of
quilted items from long down coats and duffel coats to pert quilted
mini-skirts.
   Every season Krizia picks specific motifs to adorn her pullovers
and sweaters. For next winter she steals cherubs from a Renaissance
painting and prints them on her soft cashmere pullovers and short
sweater dresses. White horses and imperial eagles also adorn many
of her outfits.
   To dress up her sporty look Mariuccia Mandelli, the woman behind
the Krizia label, embroiders gold onto lapels, hemlines and cuffs.
   Since last winter, the Italian designers have caught on to the
ecological movement, replacing their once sumptuous furs with
exquisite lookalikes in teddy-bear plush. Thus the Krizia lady can
flaunt her tiger, leopard or brightly dyed beaver knowing its all
innocuous fluff.
   Missoni has been king of Italian knitwear ever since he
presented his reversible knit and quilted jackets in Florence
several decades ago. But his latest collection, entirely dedicated
to the Soviet Union, is one of the best in seasons.
   Beautiful reversible coats and parkas are knitted in patterns of
Russian folk art: the onion towers of Red Square, the quaint houses
of a Russian village, the geometric designs of a carpet.
   These patterns are also used for the knitted jumpsuits and sweat
pants, as well as for the silk evening outfits.
   Later in the day, Keith Varty for Byblos presented his version
of the sporty 1990-91 winter woman.
   True to his British blood, he dresses her in the favorite items
of his native countryside, riding jackets with velvet collars,
riding breeches,and blouses complete with ascot tie. Lace
embroidery adds a feminine touch to the austere look.
   For languid hours by the fire of your favorite ski lodge Varty
offers heavy knit pullovers in ivory-white with large rose
patterns, and cable-knit Irish sweaters.
   Speaking of skiing, Varty's new parka with string-tie and
fur-trimmed hood in icy beige or blue are sure to be a hot item on
the slopes from Aspen to St. Moritz.
