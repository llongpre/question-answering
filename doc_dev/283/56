   Emanuel Ungaro's luxury ready-to-wear show Tuesday
did more for the rich peasant look from the East than anybody since
Yves Saint Laurent brought out folklore from the steppes in 1976.
   And Ungaro made it sexy in a Parisian way that only master
tailor and colorist could pull off. It was his best ready-to-wear
show in many seasons.
   Everything was there in an up-to-date melding of East and West.
Ungaro took flower-printed long velvet skirts and topped them with
shimmery lame blouses or flowered vests and rich, quilted velvet
short jackets and Russian army hats or pillboxes with tassels.
   Color ran riot in this show that had plenty of sophisticated
smooth-wool daytime suits with bicolor waist-fitted tops, in
eye-catching shades like violet, carmine or peacock with charcoal,
emphasizing feminine curves.
   But the sexy message was there, this time in good taste. A
voluptuous model looked fancy but fetching in a decollete silk
jersey blouse and wrapped flowered satin long high-waisted skirt
ornamented by a bright pink taffeta bow and jeweled pin.
   The skirt was split to show plenty of leg. The whole thing was
topped by a royal blue taffeta-lined multicolored velvet jacket.
   Ungaro used loads of metallic soft leathers in brief minis,
sleek long pants, quilted anoraks. But he also mixed these up with
colorful printed silk velvets, satin tunics, throwing in
beautifully cut checked suits and straight pants.
   His lame-shot silk print chiffon blouses will be coveted by
anybody with a yearning to shimmer and shine, at any time of day. A
new fashion message beaming from Paris: it's OK to look fairly
glitzy even for lunch, as long as you do it tastefully.
   Part of Ungaro's new exuberance was high, knee-covering boots
worn with the minis, the most sensational in flowered prints and
brocades.
   The glory of this collection was that one can choose. Pile on
the opulence to flaunt it, or pare things down to the Ungaro
details _ all excellent.
   Even the ``little black dress,'' a strapless short sheath, was
perfectly dressed up by strands of pearls and cabochon stones,
topped by an airy black organza shrug.
   At Guy Laroche, the boutique-line designer Guy Douvier got all
the trends right in an upbeat collection full of the current colors
and silhouettes.
   While Ungaro's ``Parallele'' line is expensive, a suit upward of
$2,000 or more, the somewhat simpler but still fashionable Laroche
offerings are well-made, and cost about half as much.
   He went in for flaring shortie coats, the mohair versions
looking great with important patch pockets in primary colors or
more subtle shades of vanilla, coral or violet.
   In the sporty lines, Douvier showed good long cable-knit
collegiate pullovers or silver-buttoned cardigans over tiny tweed
minis. There were also great tricolor knit dresses topped by
black-edged shawls.
   Laroche offered the currently trendy bright quilted duffels. For
evening, the gold versions opened up to reveal sexy split-skirt
outfits or a wonderful brown and lame pleated lace cocktail dress.
   One classic but novel trouser outfit here teamed an apple-green
bolero and jersey pullover with narrow khaki suede pants and a
fringed violet and yellow shawl printed with a wild-animal pattern.
   Both Ungaro and Laroche showed versions of puffy iridescent
bubble short evening dresses but they somehow looked a bit passe
compared with the slinkier gowns split up the leg.
   Laroche brought out some nice short minks and fur-lined suede
duffel coats.
   Frederic Castet, for 20 years the fur designer at Dior,
displayed his fur-lined fashions in his runway debut. He will open
a shop on the rue Bassano, in the fashion area known as the
``golden triangle'' near the Champs-Elysees, celebrating the event
with golden triangle adornments on belts and sunflower motifs
appliqued on silk blouses.
   Besides the most sumptuous duffels, parkas and swirly pyramid
minks in natural or dyed ruby or indigo shades, chinchilla, fox and
fisher, Castet also brought out a beautiful new fake fur in woven
silk called ``Castiss.''
   It's a dead-ringer for sheared mink or beaver, and looks fine as
duffels, parkas, or taffeta raincoat linings.
   Valentino brought out his usual impeccably cut outfits, often
featuring a new look in tiny ``Fortuny'' or crystal pleating all
over dresses in flounces or palazzo pants.
   He piled on satin, lace and gold-leaf appliques for an opulent
effect.
