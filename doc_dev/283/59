   About 2,000 people _ most of them silent, some
sobbing quietly _ braved near-freezing temperatures early today to
open a display on the Ellipse behind the White House of a massive
quilt memorializing AIDS victims on the Ellipse behind the White
House.
   ``It's a beautiful thing but it's built on corpses,'' said Cleve
Jones, who opened an 11-hour rite in which 495 people, including
entertainers and Kitty Dukakis, were to read all 8,288 names
embroidered and painted on the quilt's panels.
   ``I guess the main thing I'm feeling this morning is anger,''
said Jones, who made the first 3-foot by 6-foot panel after the
death of his friend in 1986 from AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. He said he was angry most at President Reagan.
   ``At this point it's a little late for Mr. Reagan to do
anything,'' Jones said. ``He should have understood many years ago
that a new and deadly virus has emerged and that it was time to
take some action.''
   Jones said Reagan had many opportunities to act, including when
former Rep. Stewart McKinney, R-Conn., ``or his friend Rock
Hudson'' died from AIDS.
   As the names of the AIDS victims resounded over the address
system, Mayer and Pat Levy of St. Louis, whose 31-year-old son died
last year, silently waited their turn to read their list.
   ``We're doing this in memory of our son _ to help others,'' Levy
said tearfully, noting that the quilt would help parents ``releive
their grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed
away.''
   Others, like Chris Bates of Washington just cried.
   `I knew all of these people in New York, San Francisco and
Washington,'' Bates said. ``They were my contemporaries. I'm not 40
yet and all I talk about now is death _ my grandmother talks about
death _ it's not right.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis, was scheduled to read later today some of the names of the
victims listed on the quilt, which is the size of nearly seven
football fields.
   Among others scheduled to read the names of victims were Rep.
Gerry Studds, D-Mass., and actresses Shirley MacLaine, Sigourney
Weaver and Elizabeth McGovern.
   Construction of the quilt began in 1986 after project executive
director Cleve Jones made the first panel for a friend who died of
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Since it was first displayed in the capital last year, the quilt
has more than quadrupled in size, from 1,920 panels to 8,800.
   At its present size, it represents more than one-fifth of the
approximately 42,000 Americans known to have died of AIDS since
June 1981.
   The framework for the display, complete with 16 miles of canvas
walkway and trim arranged to allow an expected 250,000 spectators a
closer view of the quilt's panels, was laid out Friday.
   Many of the volunteers, such as Boston's Julie Kaufman, became
involved with the project after a friend died of the disease.
   Travel kits, T-shirts, posters and a book about the life stories
behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the cost of
bringing the massive display to the capital.
   Panels not on the Ellipse will be on display around the city at
various AIDS support group centers. American Red Cross headquarters
here has an exhibit of photographs of AIDS victims.
   Debra Resnik, who managed a 20-city tour for the quilt, said
public reaction has been strong.
   ``There was such an outpouring of relief, of pain,'' she said.
``Especially when we went to cities like Kansas City, New Orleans,
Baltimore, the really sheltered places where (friends and relatives
of AIDS victims) are so alone. You have a place to go, to carry
your grief.''
   Former actor Barry Singer, who has AIDS, agreed that the quilt
offers a chance to humanize the statistics. But he said it provokes
a number of emotions, including anger.
   ``There wouldn't have to be a quilt if there would have been
government intervention,'' he said. ``It is now up to the people to
realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the gay
community dying from AIDS.''
