<LEADPARA>  LATER THIS SUMMER, SAN JOSE ARTIST THERESE MAY'S 14-by-14-foot quilt, "Animal
Spiral," will be unveiled at the San Jose Convention Center. The quilt,
commissioned by the city's Art in Public Places program, features May's
signature combinations of soft-touch textures, floating threads, highly
evocative dreamlike imagery and good-humored hues. May's artistry has been on
display in museums and galleries in Japan, Greece, France and the USSR and
around the United States since she started making quilts 20 years ago.;    May
lives with some of her favorite quilts in an apartment near Japantown. "I like
to surround myself with my quilts. The patterns and themes are very
light-hearted. They put me in a great mood," she says. May studied fine arts
at San Jose State University, and originally intended to be a painter. Now
making as many as 20 quilts a year, she picks up her brushes only to paint on
her pieced fabrics.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I grew up in Wisconsin, and my grandmother was my first great
inspiration," May says. "She knitted mittens and made clothes without
patterns. I often did drawings and my grandmother would tell me that they were
beautiful. It was terrific encouragement for a young artist.";    She married
artist Tony May, and moved to San Jose in 1971. Raising two children, she
began making quilts for the family. Her designs, which combined traditional
quilt techniques with photo imagery and painted surfaces, caught the attention
of friends and gallery owners.;    "I love working with quilts because so much
of the color and texture is already there in the fabric. I figure out the
design on grid paper first, then piece the colors together. It's slow, like
meditation.";    The artist says she has grown more confident of her craft
over the years, and their colors are getting lighter and brighter. "Living
with my quilts, I can see my own evolution as an artist. The patterns today
look very optimistic," says May with a smile.;    Therese May's quilts are
available through Viewpoint Gallery, Carmel, and Allegra Gallery, San Jose.  </TEXT>
