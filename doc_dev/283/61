   Indiana's Dublin may not be on the travel
itinerary of many foreign visitors, but it's a must stop for six
Irish firefighters touring the United States in a motor home.
   Dublin, which has about 1,000 residents, is one of eight Dublins
on the firefighters' itinerary. So far, they've been to Dublins in
North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia and
Kentucky.
   After leaving Dublin, Ind., they planned to head east to Dublin,
Ohio.
   Rex A. Snyder, president of the Dublin Fire Department, said the
Irishmen were expected to arrive Saturday, exchange gifts and then
attend a reception.
   The locals hope the Irishmen won't be too disappointed, however,
when they learn that the naming of Dublin had nothing to do with
the Irish city of the same name.
   Clarence Bryant, 71, the unofficial historian of Dublin, Ind.,
said there are two stories about the town's name.
   One school believes the town was called Dublin because travelers
along the National Road, the nation's first interstate, had to
``double'' their teams to get through a swampy area and up a hill
near Dublin.
   The other story was that so many pioneers used the National Road
to head west that it was necessary to have a two-room inn _ a
double inn _ to accommodate them all, Bryant said.

   A giant quilt hand-sewn into the shape of
North Dakota in honor of the state's 100th birthday received rave
reviews from about 500 people who inspected it in stocking feet.
   ``I'm proud of how it turned out,'' said Leona Tennyson, 73, who
coordinated the quilt's construction. ``A lot of people put a lot
of time and effort into it. I think it's a good, clean way to
celebrate our centennial.''
   The quilt, which covered the entire floor of the Civic Memorial
Auditorium, was measured Thursday night at 123 feet, 10 inches at
its widest point and 75 feet, 9 inches deep.
   The measurements were taken by members of the North Dakota
Centennial Commission, which hopes the quilt will be confirmed as
the world's largest by the Guinness Book of World Records.
   Guinness lists a Belgian quilt sewn in 1982 and measuring 69
feet, 6 inches by 99 feet, 5 inches and sewn as its current record.
   The centennial quilt contains 1,360 four-inch-square township
blocks, many with carefully crafted symbols of the local landscape,
natural resources and history.
   ``It's hard to imagine putting this all together with some of
the detail that went into the work,'' said Fargo Mayor Jon
Lindgren, who joined some 500 other spectators in viewing the quilt.
   Most of the spectators walked on the quilt in stocking feet to
locate familiar landmarks or family farmsteads. Some knelt on all
fours to get a closer look.
   More than 7,000 volunteers around the state worked on the
project, which took 23 months to complete, according to Ms.
Tennyson, who teaches arts and crafts in Antler, along the North
Dakota-Canada border.

   The Herbert Hoover Presidential
Library-Museum is having a casting call for people with a
presidential look.
   Amateur and professional actors from around the Midwest may
attend the April 12 audition and take a crack at impersonating any
of the 39 presidents.
   The winner will receive $200 for two hours' work during the
April 23 opening of a ``39 Men'' exhibit of presidential
memorabilia.
   The collection includes more than 200 articles associated with
the presidents, including George Washington's saber, Abraham
Lincoln's shawl, John Kennedy's rocking chair and Millard
Fillmore's handwritten will.
   Auditions are sponsored by the Hoover Library Association, which
is helping to finance the exhibit, considered the most extensive
ever undertaken at the presidential library.
