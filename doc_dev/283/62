   Kitty Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis, will join celebrities Saturday reading
the names of AIDS victims memorialized in a 750-by-500-foot quilt
to be laid out on the Elipse behind the White House.
   Chris Minor, an Atlanta native who made 20 of the quilts 8,288
panels in memory of friends who died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, said Mrs. Dukakis has helped the anti-AIDS movement in
San Francisco where the quilt project is based and participated in
a program to take meals to AIDS victims.
   Others among the 495 people scheduled to read names of victims
are actresses Shirley McClaine, Sigourney Weaver and Elizabeth
McGovern and Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.
   The framework for the display, complete with 16 miles of canvas
walkway to allow an expected 250,000 spectators a closer view of
the quilt's panels, was laid out Friday. Each panel is 3-feet by
6-feet.
   Saturday's program, scheduled to begin at sunrise with the
reading of the first set of 32 names as the panels are being laid
out, is expected to last 11 hours, according to NAMES Project
spokesman Danny Sauro.
   Many of the volunteers became involved with the project after a
friend died of the disease. One group from Boston is selling
``travel kits'' of aspirin, condoms, safe sex pamphlets and combs.
   The travel kits, t-shirts, posters and a book about the life
stories behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the
costs of bringing the massive display to the capital.
   Panels not on the Elipse will be on display around the city at
various AIDS support group centers. American Red Cross
headquarters, across the street from the quilt, has an exhibit of
photographs of AIDS victims.
   Debra Resnik, who managed a 20-city tour for the quilt, expected
the reaction to the display, which is now the size of four football
fields, to be similar to what it received on the tour.
   ``It was incredible,'' she said. ``There was such an outpouring
of relief, of pain. Especially when we went to cities like Kansas
City, New Orleans, Baltimore, the really sheltered places where
(friends and relatives of AIDS victims) are so alone. You have a
place to go, to carry your grief.''
   Former actor Barry Singer, who has AIDS, agreed that the quilt
offers a chance to humanize the statistics. But he said it provokes
a number of emotions, including anger.
   ``There wouldn't have to be a quilt if there would have been
government intervention,'' he said. ``It is now up to the people to
realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the a
gay community dying from AIDS.''
