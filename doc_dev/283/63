   A 13-ton quilt memorializing the more than
12,000 people who have died from AIDS was unfolded on the Ellipse
across from the White House on Friday, marking the final time it is
to be displayed in the nation's capital.
   The quilt, making its third appearance in Washington, was to be
the centerpiece of weekend activities, including a caldlelight
march to the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday, the addition of the
names of 300 more victims of the disease and the reading of all the
name aloud.
   The quilt consists of 10,848 panels containing the names and
some personal items of AIDS victims.
   As of Aug. 31, 61,655 people were known to have died of AIDS in
the United States since June 1 1981.
   The Names Project Foundation will continue to display the quilt
in other cities both in the United States and aboard, usually
showing only parts of it.
