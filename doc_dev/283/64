   In the time it takes to read this sentence, six
rows of knitting or about 1,000 stitches can be knit on even the
cheapest home knitting machine.
   Revolution or evolution? The experts aren't quite sure, but all
agree that the recent surge in knitting machine sales is changing
the face of home knitting in the United States.
   ``The growth has already started _ we're in the infancy of a
knitting machine boom,'' said Rick Drainville of White Knitting
Machines Co., a division of VWS Inc. in Cleveland. ``If you asked
someone what a knitting machine was five, 10 years ago they would
have looked at you.''
   ``I will increase my business at least tenfold in the next four
years,'' agreed Gjoko Ruzio, president of the Kimberly Market Co.
of Stockton, N.J., which imports the lightweight Bond knitting
machine. ``I'm aiming to sell 250,000 units per year by 1992.''
   U.S. knitting machine sales rose from about 5,000 in 1980 to
50,000 in 1986, according to figures compiled by White Knitting
Machines. It is estimated that about 70,000 machines will be sold
this year.
   For the uninitiated, knitting machines come in several distinct
models and price ranges:
   _Lightweight or hobby machines range from $200 to $350, not
including accessories.
   _Punchcard machines, which are able to automatically repeat a
pattern of up to 24 stitches, range from $400 to $850 without
accessories.
   _State-of-the-art electronic machines, some of which can take a
photocopy of a design and reproduce it on a knitted fabric, range
from $950 to almost $1,600.
   Accessories vary widely, from $2 weights that ensure even
knitting to ribbers that can knit and purl in the same row to
motors that cost almost as much as the machine itself. Perhaps the
most advanced accessory is a computer that allows knitters to
design their own patterns in color on their television sets.
   ``Electronic machines are driving the market demand,'' said
Allen Tuchman, vice president of Knitking Corp. in Los Angeles.
``Each machine with more hoots and bells really does allow you to
use it more.''
   All machines save one, the Harmony Auto-Knitter of Maine, are
imported. European knitting machines are imported by Passap, VWS
and Kimberly Market Co. Japanese machines are imported by Brother
International Corp., Knitking Corp., Singer Sewing Co., Studio
Products Inc. and Newton's Knits, Inc.
   Lightweight machines are beginning to be sold through mass
market retailers like J.C. Penney Co. Inc., but individual dealers
still sell the vast majority of machines. Dealers and importers
offer a number of support systems to help machine knitters expand
their expertise, including lessons and seminars, newsletters,
800-numbers, service centers, patterns and clubs.
   Experts hail the growth of machine knitting as the salvation of
an industry that has been on the wane.
   ``Our lifestyle is not what it used to be. Hand-knitting is
fading because of demands on people's time,'' said Lynne Higgins, a
former yarn shop owner in Chattanooga, Tenn., who now produces and
distributes videotape knitting machine lessons.
   ``Machines are the best thing happening to the yarn industry,''
agreed Karen Ancona, editor of Craft &amp; Needlework Age in
Englishtown, N.J. ``Yarn sales, which had been dropping, have
stabilized.''
   Who is buying knitting machines?
   Many lightweight machines are being purchased for or by teens,
or by women in their mid-20s who have more limited time and income
than women in the 40-to-60-year-old bracket, according to Higgins.
   Cynthia Monsky of the Singer Sewing Co. says about 40 percent of
the people who buy Singer knitting machines do so in order to sell
their work. Some of these knitters supply the Colorado and New
England ski industries.
   Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Vogue Knitting, says sewers and
weavers are attracted to knitting machines, the former because of
their familiarity with machines and the latter because they can
obtain results so quickly.
   ``You can finish a project in less than a day, '' said Marlene
Cuniberti, owner of the Machine Knitting Studio in Englewood, N.J.,
and editor of Macknit, a magazine for machine knitters. ``I've
knitted a quilt for a twin bed in a couple of hours.''
   Machine knitting sales are particularly strong, but not limited
to, the Northeast, Midwest and California.
   ``Knitting used to be dictated by climate, but that's no longer
true,'' said Carol Nepton, spokeswoman for Brother International
Corp. in Piscataway, N.J. ``Florida and Texas are in major growth
patterns because of the popularity of cotton yarns and short-sleeve
sweaters.''
   ``Our hopes and dreams are to make the knitting machine as
essential to the home as a sewing machine,'' said Nepton, adding
that 80 percent of U.S. homes own a sewing machine. ``We need to
get it into the school systems, the home economics classes. We
haven't even cracked that area yet.''
   Speed and the potential for creativity are cited as the main
reasons for purchasing a knitting machine.
   ``We want to speak to the lady who is looking for a hobby in
which she can become creative,'' said Kimberly's Ruzio. ``We teach
her to paint by numbers, and then give her the tools to become a
Warhol or a Da Vinci.''
