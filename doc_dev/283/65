<LEADPARA>  IT'S a glorious year for stars and stripes decor.;    Variations on Old Glory
are never out of style, particularly around the Fourth of July, but it's
doubtful the selection of home furnishings in red, white and blue has ever
been as plentiful as it is today. Consider dinner plates, coffee mugs,
tumblers, pitchers, trays, ice buckets, napkins, napkin rings, place mats,
tablecloths, blankets, pillows, sheets, bed spreads, towels, door mats, wind
socks, wall hangings, doorstops and cedar chests.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There is even a flag garage door.;    "It was my wife's idea," says Thomas
Hauck of the American flag he and his son-in-law Tim Anderson painted in late
December on Hauck's garage door in Sunnyvale as a gesture of support for the
troops in the Persian Gulf. "We have a corner lot on Heron Avenue facing
Homestead Road and we had flags flying. Jo said, 'Why don't you just make the
whole garage door a flag?' We thought we'll give it a shot, what the heck.";  
 Hauck and Anderson, partners in TRH Painting Services, spent close to two
days on the job. While work was in progress, an Amsterdam television crew
stopped by to film them, and the finished door has since appeared in local
newspapers and on television stations.;    "The reaction has been
overwhelming," Hauck says. "Mothers with kids over there, and wives, came by
to have their pictures taken with the flag background. We've had GIs come back
and knock on the door and thank us, and we've gotten more than 150 letters in
the mail from veterans and others thanking us.";    In spite of the favorable
reaction, Hauck says he's had no requests to duplicate the flag door -- a job
he estimates would cost about $450.;    Most people prefer their flag decor on
a smaller scale.;    Mary Emmerling, author of several books on American
Country antiques, cooking and decor, says she's been collecting flag-motif
items for more than 20 years.;    "I grew up in Washington, D.C., and I always
loved the flags and parades," she says. Today, Emmerling's summer home in
Bridgehampton, N.Y., has a flag gate to greet visitors. She says she doesn't
like to "shout" her passion, but stars and stripes are visible in her home,
from beach towels to quilts to a salad bowl. Emmerling wears a wardrobe of
flag-motif clothing, from jackets to sweaters to socks to shoes, and even her
dog, Star, wears a flag-patterned collar.;    The American flag is appealing,
Emmerling says, because "it makes you feel good. It's cheery and it makes you
feel like a celebration is at hand -- a picnic or the Fourth of July.";   
Emmerling has witnessed the flag's rise in popularity in the two years she's
been working on "Mary Emmerling's American Country Flags" book, due this fall
($15, Clarkson Potter). "It's easy to do this book now, but it was hard two
years ago," she says. "People would just put out flags for the Fourth of July
and Memorial Day, but now they're just leaving them out.";    Emmerling can
thank the recent upsurge in patriotism for much of this, says Elbert
Erlebacher,  professor of history at De Paul University in Chicago. The flag,
he says, is a way of "people showing their feelings about the country. It
usually enjoys a big increase in popularity in times of war, or after a
victory in the wake of a war.";    In addition to wars, Erlebacher points out
that flags enjoy a popularity upsurge around anniversaries such as the 1976
bicentennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the more
recent 1986 centennial of the Statue of Liberty. "You can look at pictures of
parades and exhibits and see the single most frequent decoration is bunting in
flag colors," he says.;    Red, white and blue bunting evoking the feeling of
the flag is typical of the route manufacturers take in offering stylized
interpretations, since displaying an exact reproduction of the U.S. flag in
any form other than a flag is illegal.;    While Desert Storm goosed the
flag's popularity, much of the merchandise hitting store shelves was designed
far in advance of that conflict.;    Always a trend initiator, Ralph Lauren's
fondness for flags pre-dated the Persian Gulf war and obviously spurred others
in the industry to follow suit. He used stylized American flags in his fall
1989 clothing collections for both men and women and has used flag motifs in
his tabletop line since last year. This spring the Polo USA pillowcase,
oversize "Betsy" towels and napkin rings joined the existing place mats and
napkins.;    Sales of the "Betsy" line have been year-round and country-wide,
according to Lauren's office.;    "Beyond its symbolic associations, the flag
is a timeless, beautiful graphic," says John Idol, president of the Ralph
Lauren Home Collection. "The bold lines and crisp colors of the stars and
stripes have an enduring, familiar appeal.";    Nancy Trainor, president of
Avery's of California in San Jose, says, "It's a trend in the industry that
started more than a year ago. Manufacturers can't produce dinnerware overnight
like they do T-shirts.";    Trainor says she placed orders in January for the
flag-motif tumblers, trays, bowls, ice buckets and coffee mugs she's selling.
"We always bring in red, white and blue goods for Memorial Day and the Fourth
of July. I bought more goods this year and we're selling more.";    Alice
Schnapier, vice president of advertising and sales promotion for Fieldcrest,
says the company's "Flag Quilt" blanket throw is part of a "revival of things
American and the brightness of the red, white and blue.";    The $50 flag
throw due in stores in August has had "a very, very positive reaction" among
retailers, she says, but thus far Fieldcrest is confining the stars and
stripes motif to the blanket. "We haven't done anything in bedding ensembles
or towels, but at the last market we did a wall of towels in red, white and
blue picking up the flag colorations," Schnapier says.;    Many Old Glory
items are transitory in nature, but one that is clearly meant to become a
family heirloom is the American flag-motif cedar storage chest from Lane. The
front of the chest re-creates one of the most famous pieces of American folk
art -- the painted flag farm gate from the Darling farm in Jefferson County,
N.Y. It is believed to have been painted in 1876 and is in the collection of
the Museum of American Folk Art in New York.;    The chest was introduced in
1982 as the hallmark of Lane's America Collection of furniture, designed in
cooperation with the folk art museum. It was discontinued in 1989, but "we
brought it back in January of this year with the new resurgence in patriotic
themes," says Carolyn Davis of the Lane advertising department. The chest's
retail price is $700, but the Horchow Home Collection catalog has it on sale
for $450.;    While most catalog firms, including Horchow and Lillian Vernon,
view flag-motif items as seasonal, some retailers expect the flag to continue
flying high in home furnishings for some time. They also expect this patriotic
wave to extend into increased popularity for American-made goods.  </TEXT>
