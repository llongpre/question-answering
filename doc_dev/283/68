   Wrapping up a week of designer fashion shows in
New York Friday, Geoffrey Beene presented sleek, uniform-inspired
clothes and anchored his ensembles with insets in the shape of
triangles.
   ``I always try to keep the collection as contemporary as
possible,'' said Beene, who has opted for stark, dramatic looks
that establish his niche as an American designer.
   Control, discipline, fullness and sensuous severity are Beene's
own words for characterizing the collection, which includes
functional, ankle-length jersey tent dresses in dark tones such as
black or gray, with leather insets. Somber shades of loden, taupe,
wine and chocolate contribute to the sense of austerity.
   Strap-on accessories, such as a strip of leather, sweep over the
shoulder, military-style.
   When you think of Beene, think of triangles, which apper
throughout the collection, at the hipbone, above the bust, along
the neck and within a fluttering hemline. A black evening column
dress showed off a gold triangle quilted onto the bodice, and a
black suit had triangles of red satin at the shoulder blade. It's
all part of Beene's love affair with geometric shapes.
   Beene continued his tradition of shunning traditional lines;
he'll take a curve whenever he can. He showed a wool fleece and
quilted satin bolero with seams streaming from the bust down both
sleeves. And Beene uses curved hems, ``which move fashion from an
applied art to a fine art,'' says fashion arbiter Eleanor Lambert,
creator of the 50-year-old International Best-Dressed List.
   Beene also showed jumpsuits, another longtime favorite, which he
considers ``the most functional piece of clothing in the
collection.''
   Another trademark look is the short, buoyant full evening skirt
of silk combined with a fitted bodice, sometimes with point
d'esprit.
   ``He's the quintessential American designer, superb, tops,''
says Ellin Saltzman, senior vice president and fashion director of
R.H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc.
   Meanwhile, Donna Karan introduced a collection dedicated to
``pure comfort, luxury, and sensuality.'' Chock full of shades of
brown, grays, beiges and taupes, in fabrics such as cashmere,
``furry'' alpaca fleece, wool crepe jersey, lacquer sequins and
velvet, the collection exudes a sense of softness and ease.
   Monochromatic ensembles predominate, with matching opaque hose
and shoes.
   Emphasis is on the unconstructed jacket, in an updated longer
length, worn over a narrow unitard for a neat, linear look. The
unitard is often paired with a short circular skirt with lots of
swing, fairly buoyant with movement. Also capturing the wave of
motion are circular coats over unitards.
   For evening, Karan creates dramatic contrast by teaming black
velvet with white lacquer sequins. A black velvet circular
wrap-around coat with a matching stretch velvet dress was set off
by an oyster lacquer sequin scarf, creating a striking play of tone.
   Karan counts as one of the many American designers, such as
Blass and dell'Olio for Anne Klein, who are knocking down
distinctions between day and nighttime looks. Like Blass, who is
showing strapless gray cashmere for evening, Karan offers an
oversize gray cashmere off-the-shoulder cowl sweater teamed with a
platinum sequin draped skirt.
   Karan's favorite after-five look is a sequins-on-cashmere kimono
top with a short stretch skirt, her version of a combination of
sweatshirt comfort and drop-dead sexiness.
