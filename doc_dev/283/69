<TEXT>     Bellaver is well known in the Bay Area for her award-winning traditional
work, ranging from pastel portraits to quilts and paintings of quilts. Her
work has been exhibited nationally.;    Recently, she has moved away from
painting that is completely representational. "I felt the itch to experiment
more," she says. "I am trying to express my feelings through more abstract
forms.";    Almost all Bellaver's paintings -- oils, pastels and mixed media
-- retain some recognizable objects, but her rearrangement of images is now
more fluid. That very rearrangement is the theme of "Trying To Fit," mixed
media on canvas. A crunched assembly line of female forms, the painting evokes
the dilemma of women trying to fit all the parts of their lives together --
families, careers, self.;    The central figure in "Mending the Hollow"
(acrylic on paper) is accompanied by other people, all of whom propose their
own remedies to grief. One figure holds a rose, another a needle and thread.; 
  In selecting the two exhibitors from more than 200 applications, Chabot
Gallery director John Komisar said he looked for compatible work by "2-D and
3-D" artists. "There's an overlapping of attitude here, a way of playing on
figures and shapes." Hiramoto's nine sculptures are small, decorated
buildings.;    The gallery is between Buildings 900 and 1000 on the Hayward
campus, 25555 Hesperian Blvd. Gallery hours are 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday
through Thursday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday. For information, call (415)
786-6600.  </TEXT>
