Part of the national AIDS Memorial Quilt was vandalized after members of a 
singles club meeting at a Miami hotel asked that it be removed from display 
because it was "ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Two teddy bears were cut from quilt panels during the weekend and were later 
found in boxes headed for the garbage, the display organizer and a hotel 
manager said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to a cemetery and kicking over tombstones," said Jerry Suarez, 
chairman of the South Florida Names Project, which set up the quilt display.
