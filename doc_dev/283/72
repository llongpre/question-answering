   President Reagan made a telephone call Tuesday
to a school in Hendersonville, Tenn., to thank pupils who sent him
a quilt depicting the state birds in the 50 states, a White House
spokesman said.
   Mark Weinberg said Reagan initially talked to Donna Lilla, a
teacher who supervised the project by young fifth-grade children in
connection with their study of American history and the
Constitution.
   Weinberg said that a portion of the president's conversation was
piped into the Wessington Place Elementary School, and that Reagan
complimented the youths on the ``wonderful, beautiful'' quilt.
   He said the president told the pupils that he ``admired their
artisty and handiwork'' and told them he would have the quilt
displayed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
