<LEADPARA>  Lizards -- if not actually leaping -- are much in view at the Olive Hyde Art
Gallery. For whatever reasons of aesthetic convergences, a host of fiber
animals appear among 48 pieces accepted for the 23rd annual textile exhibit. 
Ina Coronado's first-place award work, "Where Are All the Dreamers?," features
two long-tailed lizards. In somber beige and brown, they cling to the side of
a woven raffia vessel, patterned in the spirit of an Indian basket. A friskier
lizard with painted spots climbs on another of her baskets, "La Raza.";   
Other critters in the fiber menagerie include more lizards, chickens, birds, a
dog, a cat and fantasy fauna, variously woven, embroidered, knotted or painted.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The show was juried by Richard Elliott of the University of California,
Davis, and resident artist at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, and
Nance O'Banion, artist and professor at California College of Arts and Crafts
in Oakland. The exhibit, marks several departures from previous years: the
emergence of well-designed tapestries, almost no wearable art unless you count
warming yourself in a handwoven Afghan, little hand-made paper and none of the
jewelry of past shows. The craft work is of high order, with materials ranging
from rough twigs to hand-painted silks.;    Joyce Hulbert's second-place
"Nocturne" incorporates the surrealistic imagery of a dreamer's world into a
tapestry of hand-dyed black and gray yarns. Julia Ricciardi Vansell fastened
branches to enclose space within a cone-shaped construction, "One Leg to Stand
On." It took third prize. Close by, another work with references to human
anatomy is Donna Adamson's wire screen "body" has a surgical incision held
open with old-fashioned clothespins revealing tangled innards of plastic
tubing and colored wires -- just what you've always feared.;    Among the
honorable mentions: Luis Garcia's "Jigsaw" in needlepoint drew inspiration
from puzzles, but also is reminiscent of sand painting. Joy Gladding continues
her experiments with ritual clothing with birds painted onto a pleated blue
silk kilt. Heather Urquhart's quilt, "Hundreds Dead in Huge Quake"
incorporates images of newspaper headlines, stories and maps from the Loma
Prieta earthquake. Selma Grossman's "Hanging Together -- Homunculae" presents
miniature people as acrobats in the circus of life. Karen Haas combines subtly
dyed woven rags with jute and leaves for the rough-textured "Indoor/Outdoor
Carpet.";    Joy Rubin's tapestry, "Alleged," dominates one wall with its
dramatic oversize "mug shots" of men's faces and hats, and checkered
backgrounds. The persistent scarlet A's that repeat through the enclosing
border refer to stereotyping people "by their attire, appearance,
backgrounds.";    The textile exhibit continues through June 9 at the Olive
Hyde Art Gallery in Fremont. Hyde, the benefactor who left the building to the
city, was herself a weaver.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The free, city-owned Olive
Hyde Art Gallery, at 123 Washington Blvd., Fremont, is open from 12:30 to 5
p.m. Wednesday through Sunday, with additional hours from 6 to 8:30 p.m.
Thursday. Tours are by appointment. For information, call (415) 791-4357.  </TEXT>
