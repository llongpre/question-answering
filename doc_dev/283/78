After Columbus Day, the Names Project will scale back its national display of 
quilts that serves as a personal memorial to those who have died of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome, a spokesman for the organization said. "We will be 
going into senior citizen centers, classrooms and to people at risk but who 
have yet to come to terms with AIDS, and let the quilt do what it does, which 
is to reach people on a personal level," said Names Project spokesman Dan 
Sauro. Cleve Jones, a gay political activist in San Francisco, said the cost of 
mounting the full display of quilts since October, 1987, has become 
prohibitive. It will cost about $165,000 to transport and display the 
approximately 12,000 quilts Oct. 6-8 in Washington on 25 acres on the south 
side of the White House.
