   An unprecedented $580,000 fine imposed on
a pillow factory accused of hiring more than 100 illegal aliens in
a rural town reflects how shrinking job markets in border states
have dispersed immigrants, officials said.
   The civil fine levied Wednesday against Piedmont Quilting Corp.
in Walhalla is the largest imposed by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service under a 1986 law that penalizes employers
caught hiring illegal aliens.
   The INS also pursued a criminal case, and last week, the
company, its owners and nine managers were indicted on charges of
illegally recruiting and harboring 117 illegal aliens.
   In a July raid, immigration officials said they found 85 illegal
aliens from Mexico and Peru working at the plant, including a
12-year-old boy earning $4 to $5 an hour doing menial labor. All
were deported. Subsequent investigation raised the number of
illegal aliens alleged to have been hired at the plant to 117.
   Walhalla, population 4,000, is near Sumter National Forest,
about 15 miles from the Georgia and North Carolina borders in
northwestern South Carolina.
   Police Chief John Gillespie said he contacted the INS after
several plant workers stopped for traffic violations and other
minor offenses could not produce proper identification.
   Fred Alexander, deputy district director of the INS regional
office in Atlanta, said the agency tends to focus enforcement
efforts on urban areas, ``where we feel they are likely to do the
most good.''
   But while the Walhalla raid was unusual, it may be readily
explained by economic trends, beginning with depressed job markets
in Texas and Louisiana.
   ``People are traveling east for jobs and this particular group
found them in Walhalla,'' Alexander said.
   The INS does not plan to concentrate on the Southeast's textile
industry in the wake of the Piedmont Quilting case, Alexander said.
   ``I think it is by far and away the exception rather than the
rule,'' said Frederick B. Dent Jr., president of the 80-member
South Carolina Textile Manufacturers Association.
   Dent, who also is president of Mayfair Mills in Arcadia, said
even though his company cannot find enough workers, it would not
resort to hiring illegal aliens.
   ``We would rather have jobs go unfilled than to break the law
and incur the penalties and the public disgrace the Piedmont
problem brought,'' Dent said.
   ``You hear of those things in New York and Texas and border
states but it's the first time I've heard of it here,'' said James
Walsh, president-elect of the South Carolina Needle Trades
Association and manager of Lexington Sportswear. ``I think it's an
isolated incident.''
   However, possible violators of the 1986 immigration law
``probably have more of a likelihood of not being discovered'' in
the South because the INS' main resources and personnel are in
Texas and California, said Donald A. Young, officer in charge of
the agency's office in Charlotte, N.C.
   In the indictment handed up Tuesday in Greenville, Piedmont
Quilting owner Alfred Mizhir, 55, and his wife, Gail Mizhir, 30,
both of Spring Lake, N.J., face possible prison terms of 653 years
and fines totaling $5.1 million if convicted on all charges.
   The nine other indicted company managers or officers also each
face up to 653 years in prison if convicted.
   The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigation
that included the use of an undercover INS agent who posed as a
plant worker, immigration officials said.
   INS officials reported working conditions were unsafe for
children, who were confronted by large machinery and 150-pound
bales of fabric used to make pillows, quilts and comforters.
   The administrative fine also covers the company's failure to
comply with procedures to verify that the plant's more than 400
employees were not illegal aliens, INS officials said.
   The company, which has 30 days to contest the civil fine, has
refused to comment. Attorney Bill Bannister, who represents
Piedmont Quilting, did not return calls to his office Friday.
