<LEADPARA>  I AM a third-generation quilt maker, though I didn't know that when I began
making quilts 14 years ago. All I knew about quilts was the one my aunt made
for my parents when they were married. It was my "sick quilt." I remember it
from when I was young and had to stay in bed.;    When I finished college, I
was casting about for leisure activities and making quilts was on the list. So
were photography and free-lance writing.  </LEADPARA>

QUILTS PRESERVE A BIT OF HISTORY AND BUILD
ON A TRADITION  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     I had been reading about quilts for several years. Since high school, I had
enjoyed going to fabric stores and sewing clothes. The 1976 Bicentennial was
responsible for the resurgence of traditional crafts, and I felt the "correct
way" to proceed was by hand sewing. I still have a pile of those quilt blocks,
never completed.;     Then came the deadline I needed: A friend of mine was
pregnant. It took five months, but I finished a little star quilt in time for
the birth of her daughter.;     Now that I had broken the barrier between
thinking and doing, I kept going, making quilts for babies and weddings,
mostly traditional patterns. And I kept reading, taking classes, going to
quilt shows, joining a guild.;    Points of view;  After about six years, my
work changed. I started drawing my own designs, usually with a theme or point
of view, and generally with a lot of "surface embellishment," meaning beads,
sequins, stencils, Xerox transfers, charms, rubber stamps, even Legos. These
quilts aren't useful -- you can't put them on a bed or even wash them. They go
on the walls.;    So the question legitimately arises: Why make quilts in
1991? In a time of immediate gratification, why spend three to four months on
each quilt?;    I don't know why I make quilts. I can't imagine not making
quilts. I love fabric. I love to touch it and fold it and stack it at the
beginning of a project. I love drawing the designs on graph paper. I love the
connection to the past and women's history. I like the twinge of sadness I
feel when each one is done. And I like thinking I'm building on a tradition
when I make my quilts.;    Over the years I've belonged to several small
quilting groups, in earlier times called bees, where we help each other quilt.
Some now take a more academic approach and dispassionately critique the work.
I generally make my quilts alone now, but I do enjoy getting together with
other quilt makers to talk about what we're working on.;    Elvis and
earthquakes; Just as my foremothers made quilts to describe rural life,
express political beliefs or mark events, I do too. I've made quilts about
Elvis, John Lennon, architectural preservation, my childhood, travels to Latin
America and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. My next quilt will be about
archaeology and the Persian Gulf war.;    And without belaboring the metaphor,
I hope that the thread between generations continues. I have two wool quilts
my grandmother made in rural Quebec in the 1930s, ironically of the same
pattern I pieced by hand in 1977. I have a Dresden Plate quilt my aunt made in
1951. And I have helped my 6-year-old niece make her first doll quilt. I don't
know if she'll continue making quilts, but I've touched the fourth generation.  </TEXT>
