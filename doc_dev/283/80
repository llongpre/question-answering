<LEADPARA>  WITH THE ROYALS on the road. Or, there's always a Fremont angle.;    When
Queen Elizabeth II visited George Washington's Virginia home Thursday, a fancy
dress belonging to a Fremont 8-year-old was to be part of the ceremony.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Emily Heddleson could hardly wait to get to Anita Atnip's second-grade
class at Chadbourne School to share the news that the costume she'd worn in an
18th-century-style wedding last summer had been requested for ceremonies
marking the queen's visit to Mount Vernon.;    You know that little girl who
always presents flowers to the queen? (Actually, I believe the same little
girl travels everywhere with the monarch, bobbing curtsies for TV cameras. The
child is probably chaperoned by the woman who carries spare change for the
queen. The queen's purse contains only sun screen lotion.) Anyhow, the girl
needed an 18th-century dress.;    Back in Fremont, Mom Linda Heddleson had
made Emily's poufy, rose-strewed dress when the latter participated in Linda's
cousin Miles Hamby's wedding in Williamsburg, Va. Emily helped carry the
bride's 15-foot train. The entire event -- including the guests' attire -- was
a historically accurate re-creation of an 18th-century wedding.;    In an
out-of-this-century labor of love, Linda sewed coordinating costumes for Emily
and her sister Caroline and for herself. "It took from January to June to make
all three," she says.;    News of quality work gets around in the minuet crowd
back East, so historically hip event planners contacted the Heddlesons and
paid Emily $20 for the privilege of borrowing the dress.;    But the wonderful
gown turned out to be the Little Dress That Coulda instead of the Little Dress
That Did.;    The flower-presenter came down with chicken pox and couldn't go
to the party, reports Linda sadly. And the dress didn't fit the substitute.
Aww-w.; (hbox);    MORE STITCHES: If you have a significant birthday or
anniversary coming up, Nancy Payton of Fremont has a suggestion. She's winding
down the observance of her 50th birthday, which has been going on for some
months now. (Hey, she can do what she wants. She says it's her Jubilee Year,
quoting Leviticus 25:10. "And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year . . . it shall
be a jubilee unto you.");    Payton sent out quilt squares to her friends,
asking them to stitch up a little something. They sent them back decorated
with red, white and blue motifs -- from hearts and roses to stars and stripes.
The last corner square is a replica of Payton's birth certificate from
Aliquippa, Pa. The quilt tops the Payton brass bed, literally a warm reminder
of friendship.;    "It's an idea I really encourage people to try," says
Payton, who reports that others have since been inspired to commemorate major
life events the old-fashioned way, with friendship quilts.; (hbox);   
LITTLE-KNOWN BIO BITS: Ted Harpainter, former head of Fremont parks and a
well-known watercolor artist, stopped by town last week. He's heading to Italy
with sketchbook soon. But not with a group of artists, as we might expect.
"It's a reunion -- nearly the 50th anniversary -- of the ski troops from World
War II," he explains.; (hbox);    THEN AND NOW: Dee Miner, co-coordinator of
Southern Alameda County National Organization for Women, got carried away at
the state convention and pledged $100 from the chapter to help elect feminist
candidates. She admits she chose the "stereotypically female" means to earn
the money: a bake sale at every chapter meeting. Miner bakes, others buy. She
made $65 with her cupcakes and muffins last week.;    Speaking of money,
chapter members mean it when they say they don't want poverty to stand in the
way of any person (male or female) who wants to join. "We've brought our dues
down to zero for those who really can't afford them," says Miner. Used to be
$16 to $40.;    (hbox);    BEST BETS: Today, there's multi-culture in Newark.
Celtic harpist and story-teller Patrick Ball performs at 2 p.m. at LOV-Newark,
37400 Central Court.;    Tri-City Homeless Coalition sponsors an
all-you-can-eat buffet from 6:30 p.m. at the Newark Pavilion, Cherry Street at
Thornton Avenue. Booths and entertainment are from Indian, Tibetan,
Afro-American, Mexican-American, Afghani and Filipino cultures. Mary Mitchell
and Arminta King chair the event.  </TEXT>
