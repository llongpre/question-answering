   A mix-up between the National Park Service, a
Ukrainian group, and organizers of a massive quilt memorializing
people who have died of AIDS is causing logistical problems in the
nation's capital.
   Organizers of the Names Project, a 16-ton quilt bearing 10,000
names of AIDS victims, thought everything was set for the site of
their Oct. 8 ceremony, in which the quilt is to be displayed and
the names read.
   But the Park Service instead promised use of the Ellipse, a
circular lawn behind the White House, to a group of Ukrainians who
plan to hold a rally and march to celebrate 1,000 years of
Christianity the same day.
   The Ukrainians say moving would cause them too many logistical
problems, and the Park Service says it can't order a group to
relocate without a compelling reason involving public safety.
   ``The problem is that we can't force any group to move, even
though that would be the simple solution in this case. But we'd
never have suggested it to the Ukrainians if we knew the Names
Project wanted it,'' said Sandra Alley, assistant regional director
for public affairs of the Park Service. She said she the Ukrainians
are considering moving to another location.
   ``We've put together our program based on the site, we've
advertised it in our community and we're expecting 15,000 people
and to move now would be a real problem,'' said Eugene Iwanciw,
organizer of the Ukrainian Millenium Celebration.
   Names Project organizers say other sites are inadequate.
   The mix-up resulted when demonstration and project organizers
had to go through a third party to book the site.
