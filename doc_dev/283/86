<LEADPARA>  Contributing to a charity is a lovely, wonderful thing to do. American can-do
compassion, and a thousand points of light and all that stuff. But sometimes
we like to be bribed into doing good.;    Robert Redford's Sundance Institute
does lots of environmental work and helps support young and minority film
makers. And one of the ways they support all that work -- and bribe us into
helping -- is by hawking American folk art.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's good folk art, though. Handmade sterling jewelry. Hand-painted
pottery. And some beautiful quilts, many of them at surprisingly reasonable
prices. (A 23-by-29-inch American flag quilt is only $77.);    You can call
(800) 422-2770 to order. Of course you could also go rent "Havana" again, too.
But that's really asking a lot.;     GETTING OUT;    (box) TONIGHT: Baseball
and fireworks -- what's more American than that? The San Jose Giants start
things off at 7:15 at Municipal Stadium, Tenth and Alma streets, San Jose. $5,
$3 for seniors and children,  </TEXT>
