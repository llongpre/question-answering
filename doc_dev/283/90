<LEADPARA>  Two Santa Clara County sheriff deputies didn't know what to expect when a man
frantically waved them down early Saturday and uttered one word: "Baby!";  
Moments later, deputies Patricia O'Donovan and Tony Albert discovered the joy
of life on the graveyard shift when they delivered a baby in the parking lot
of Valley Medical Center in San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "They're on cloud nine," Deputy Thomas Quilty said. "It was a first for
them, delivering a baby on the job.";   Quilty said O'Donovan and Albert were
driving down Bascom Avenue at 3:10 a.m. Saturday when they were stopped by a
man waving his arms wildly on the side of the road.;   "He was a
Spanish-speaking man, and he spoke no English except the word 'baby,' " Quilty
said.;   The man, whose name was not available, hurried the officers into the
hospital parking lot, where they found the man's wife, 20-year-old Augustina
Rocha, in labor on the ground next to their car.;   The shocked deputies had
enough time to radio for an ambulance, then rolled up their sleeves and helped
deliver a healthy baby girl.;   "The baby's feet were almost out when the
ambulance arrived," Quilty said. "It happened pretty quickly. One of the
deputies wrapped the baby in a jacket.";   Mother and baby were wheeled into
the hospital, where they were doing fine Saturday.  </TEXT>
