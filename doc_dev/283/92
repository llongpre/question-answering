<LEADPARA>  Truong Thinh, a 63-year-old Vietnamese woman from San Jose who's hesitant to
speak English, learned Monday that her eloquence is on display at the U.S.
Capitol.;    Truong's oil painting of children up to their necks in flowers is
among a sampling of 28 artworks by refugees now living in California -- half
of them from Santa Clara County.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  REFUGEES' ART WINS A SHOWING ON CAPITOL HILL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The exhibit hangs inside the rotunda of the Cannon House Office Building
for the next two weeks as a reminder both of the state's cultural diversity
and the need for increased federal funding of refugee programs, said Pamela
Barry, executive director of the California Democratic congressional
delegation.;    "I'm very happy," said Truong, who visited the Capitol once
five years ago, shortly after she arrived in the United States from Ho Chi
Minh City, formerly Saigon. "I don't know. . . . Are you sure? . . . How did
my picture get there?";    The exhibition is sponsored by the Democratic
delegation. Barry conceived the idea and asked local refugee agencies, like
the Indochina Resettlement and Cultural Center in San Jose, to collect the
art.;    Oils, quilts, photographs and metal sculptures underline the
diversity of the seven refugee groups represented, including Vietnamese,
ethnic Laotians and Hmong, who moved to Laos and North Vietnam from China.;   
A watercolor by Ai Tran of San Jose depicts the city's Vietnamese cultural
heritage with U.S., Vietnamese and state of California flags. There is a
geometric wall hanging by Lou V. Xiong of Santa Clara and a red, brown and
yellow cubist painting given to San Jose's Vietnamese community by Houng
Alaska, a Vietnamese woman who took the name of her new home state.;    A
5-by-9-foot slate blue Hmong quilt hangs alone on one wall. In thousands of
stitches it tells the history of the Hmong, from their roots in China to their
settlement in Laos, their escape from North Vietnamese soldiers and finally
their resettlement in the United States.;    But history is only part of the
exhibit's message, said Barry.;    "We're trying to prove that if you give
these people a good start, they can be productive, settled and assimilated
people," she said.  </TEXT>
