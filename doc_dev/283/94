   Hundreds of museums, galleries and other
institutions plan to observe ``A Day Without Art'' on Friday to
mourn artists who have died of AIDS and for the art that might have
been.
   Plans include darkening galleries and removing or covering
artwork. Some organizations will mount special exhibitions or hold
seminars or memorial services. Others will close for the day.
   ``Our aims are to honor and recognize friends and colleagues who
have died or are dying, and to seek greater support and
understanding from an ill-informed and sometimes hostile public,''
said Thomas W. Sokolowski, director of the Grey Art Gallery and a
member of Visual AIDS, a group of art professionals who organized
the event to coincide with the World Health Organization's second
``AIDS Awareness Day.''
   The group also hopes to use the prestige of arts organizations
to add weight to calls for more AIDS services and research, said
another Visual AIDS member, Philip Yenawine, who also is director
of education at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
   ``The real tragedy is not that we have lost people who everybody
knows,'' Yenawine said. ``For every Rock Hudson, there's been 500
or 5,000 maybe that have died young enough in their lives that
their careers have not come to public attention.''
   More than 600 art institutions take part in the observance,
including about 150 in New York.
   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Pablo Picasso's portrait of
Gertrude Stein will be taken down for five days. A sign in its
place will explain the painting has been removed ``to symbolize the
losses the art community is currently experiencing because of
AIDS.''
   The Guggenheim Museum will hang a black banner on its Fifth
Avenue facade. The Museum of Modern Art and the Jewish Museum plan
memorial services.
   Sections of the Names Project Quilt, which memorializes people
who have died of AIDS, will be on display at The New-York
Historical Society, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the American Craft
Museum and the Museum of American Folk Art.
   Elsewhere:
   _About 50 art museums and galleries in New England will observe
the day. In the courtyard of Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum,
empty chairs will be set to represent Boston-area artists affected
by AIDS. Panels of the Names Project Quilt will be hung at Boston's
Museum of Fine Arts.
   _A coffin will be placed in the center of the gallery at the
University of Florida at Gainesville.
   _The Dallas Museum of Art will install a digital counter
enumerating the worldwide AIDS toll and erect black walls with the
names of artists who have died of AIDS at the entrances.
   _The Louisiana State Museum will place mourning wreaths on the
historic houses it administers around New Orleans.
   _The J. Paul Getty museum in Malibu, Calif., will dim the lights
in its photography galleries.
   _The Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the city's Museum of
Contemporary Art will waive their admission fees and suggest the
money be donated to the AIDS Project-Los Angeles.
