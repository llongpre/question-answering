CAREFULLY CHOSEN GIFTS CAN GIVE TWICE: TO FRIENDS
AND RELATIVES, AND TO A GOOD CAUSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Give your aunt the $8.95 Greenpeace calendar and you'll be helping with the
monumental task of saving the whales.;   While you can't save the world while
holiday shopping, if you are socially aware in your choices, you can make a
difference with gifts that give twice.;   A GOOD source for "twice blessed"
gifts are the many area museum shops.;   Shop staffs pride themselves on
creative choices, and an added plus is that these stores are an oasis of calm
in the frenzied world of holiday mega-malls and strip centers.;   At the San
Jose Museum of Art gift shop you'll find sterling silver "Executive Decision
Maker" cuff links -- toss your links across the table and look down to find
out if the answer is yes or no, $56; T-shirts based on Barbara Kruger's art,
including one ideal for anyone battling health problems that says "Your Body
Is A Battleground," $15.95; a striking brushed stainless steel clock with very
creative numerals, including Arabic and Roman, by Soviet artist Constantin
Boym, $120; and an origami Christmas set with 90 sheets of paper and
instructions on folding them into such shapes as Santa Claus, reindeer,
snowmen and Christmas trees, $18.95.;   At the American Museum of Quilts &amp;
Textiles in San Jose, the gift shop offers earrings made from vintage buttons,
$18-$20; wooden pins duplicating traditional quilt designs, $8.50; a silver
thimble charm, $13; several original designs by Therese May in T-shirts, sweat
shirts and scarves, $30-$60; and an extensive library of books on quilting and
other needlework projects.;   The San Jose Historical Museum also has a gift
shop filled with books on local history and reproductions of vintage toys. And
if you need a shopping break, right next door is an old-fashioned soda
fountain. One thing that sets the historical museum apart is the gift offered
with membership every year. This year it's Connie Young Yu's new book
"Chinatown, San Jose, U.S.A.," which focuses on the local Chinese settlement
of Heinlenville from 1887-1931. Memberships start at $30 for individuals and
$40 for families and include free admission to the museum as well as the
quarterly newsletter.;   GIFT shops for non-profit agencies offer a different
shopping arena. The most charming are the UNICEF shops, staffed by volunteers
and benefiting the United Nations Children's Fund.;   At the Palo Alto store
you'll find ceramic coffee mugs with matching gift cards, including one with
red hearts on a white background designed in Switzerland, $8.50; bedspreads
made in India that will gladden the heart of anyone who loved the '60s,
$16.50; a set of 20 plastic puzzle blocks in a box that can be put together to
make six different illustrations of children and animals around the world,
$15; and a wide selection of note cards, some with holiday themes.;   Many
non-profit groups publish calendars, using the proceeds to benefit their work.
This year, calendars from the Audubon Society, Sierra Club, Greenpeace and
several from the World Wildlife Fund are priced under $20, with some less than
$10.;   Other non-profit groups offer monthly magazines in return for a
membership. Smithsonian Institution publishes a monthly magazine, free to
members. In the Bay Area, KQED public television offers the monthly Focus
magazine as part of its membership package.;   Increasingly, a number of
mainstream manufacturers and designers are donating a portion of the proceeds
from sales to specific causes. Kenar president Ken Zimmerman has announced the
ambitious goal of raising $1 million for Ads Against AIDS through the sales of
the Evangelista T-shirts. The World Wildlife Fund has licensed several items
to benefit their programs, from stuffed animals to scarves.;   Retailers are
also getting into the gifts-that-give-twice act, by carrying products
specifically earmarked to benefit charitable and ecological causes.;  
Nordstrom is selling a $34 silver-plated holiday ornament in the shape of a
picture frame and a $10.50 cassette and $17 compact disc of holiday music
recorded by Windham Hill artists with proceeds benefiting Boys &amp; Girls Club
and other local children's charities.;   Nature Company has promised to donate
a portion of the sales of the $16.95 Cocolat chocolate acorns filled with
miniature chocolate squirrels to the Nature Conservancy, which works to
preserve wild lands.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The gifts mentioned in this story
