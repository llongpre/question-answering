<TEXT>     A cultivated man with a wide knowledge of the arts, Mr. Englund trained
young dancers to be sensitive to nuances of style, and he acquainted them with
anatomy, notation, dance history and stage makeup. He encouraged new
choreographers, and at the time of his death was supervising a choreographic
workshop for his company, the Joffrey II Dancers.;    Mr. Englund was born in
Seattle, where he studied ballet with Mary Ann Wells, who was also a teacher
of the choreographers Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino.;    He attended
Harvard University and the Juilliard School and studied dance in New York.;   
He performed with the Jose Limon Company, the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, the
National Ballet of Canada and American Ballet Theater, and in the musicals
"Greenwillow," "Camelot" and "The Happiest Girl in the World.";    Mr. Englund
married the dancer Gage Bush in 1959. They settled in her home town of
Birmingham, Ala., where he directed the Birmingham Ballet, making it one of
the South's leading companies.;    Among his most frequently revived works are
"Jigs 'n' Reels," which combines classical ballet with Scottish folk-dance
steps, and "Crazy Quilt," which is inspired by traditional quilting patterns.  </TEXT>
