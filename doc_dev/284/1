<LEADPARA>  IF YOUR summer vacation plans include a trip on one of Amtrak's scenic
long-distance rail lines, make reservations now. Seats are filling up, and you
may not be able to get a reservation.;    The fact that Amtrak's western
routes are increasingly popular is one of the many signs of the passenger
railroad's surprising health as it celebrates its 20th anniversary this month.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In 1971, when Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corp.
(Amtrak's actual name), no one expected it to revive a bunch of dilapidated
passenger railroads and make them a valuable national transportation asset.;  
 There seemed to be no chance that Amtrak could operate without enormous
government subsidies.;    But Amtrak is getting stronger every year, and
there's a chance that, by the turn of the century, it will be making enough
money to cover operating costs. If so, it will have to ask for federal help
only when it needs to purchase new locomotives, cars and equipment.;    The
reason Congress created Amtrak was simple: The railroads' passenger services
were losing money hand over fist and they wanted out.;    In 1929, privately
owned railroads operated 20,000 passenger trains and carried 77 percent of all
inter-city travelers in America. By 1970 the railroads were carrying only 7
percent of all inter-city travelers because most Americans preferred flying,
driving or taking a long-distance bus.;    It's quite possible that had
Congress not created Amtrak, most American passenger trains would have become
memories.;    That's particularly true for some of the storied scenic
passenger liners that cross the Great Plains and the West, including the Los
Angeles-to-Seattle Coast Starlight, the Chicago-to-San Francisco California
Zephyr, the New Orleans-to-Los Angeles Sunset Limited and the Chicago-to-Los
Angeles Southwest Chief.;    Since 1982, when Amtrak began acquiring
double-decked superliners that give travelers a superb view of passing
scenery, these western trains have attracted an ever-increasing number of
riders.;    Amtrak Vice President Tim Gardner said that since the acquisition
of the double-deckers, ridership on the western lines has soared 50 percent
and Amtrak's revenues have jumped 100 percent.;    An estimated 65,000
travelers made long-distance trips on the western trains last year, he added,
and Amtrak expects to attract 75,000 this year, many of them during the
summer.;    Nationally, Amtrak provides service in 44 states (except Alaska,
Hawaii, Maine, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, although service will be
re-inaugurated in Wyoming this summer). The railroad operates on 25,000 miles
of track, most of it owned by freight railroads.;    Amtrak's other best-known
service is on more than 600 miles of track it owns between Washington and
Boston and in the Philadelphia area. The high-speed Metroliners that travel
the Northeast Corridor are less expensive than New York-to-Washington and New
York-to-Boston air shuttles. Approximately 36 percent of all Washington-to-New
York travelers use Amtrak.;    W. Graham Claytor, Amtrak's president and board
chairman, is determined to improve and expand Amtrak's share of the New York
to Boston travel market.;    Claytor is proud of the progress Amtrak has made
and is convinced the system will be even more successful in coming years.
Ridership is certain to increase, he said, when the public gets more fed up
with highway traffic jams and crowded airport terminals.;    Claytor said
Amtrak eventually will provide daily runs from New York to Chicago and from
New Orleans to Los Angeles. Both trains now operate only three days per week.;
   Also high on his agenda are reviving service from New Orleans to
Jacksonville, Fla., from Chicago to Florida and from Chicago to Detroit.
Re-instituting the New Orleans-to-Jacksonville run would provide the last link
in rail passenger service that would run from Florida to California across the
South and Southwest.;    During coming years Amtrak will increasingly operate
commuter rail lines, Claytor said. Now, the system operates commuter rail
systems in New York, Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and California. Later
this year Amtrak will begin running two Virginia commuter lines that will
carry passengers to Washington, D.C. Eventually Amtrak will run lines in the
San Francisco-San Jose corridor and the Dallas rapid transit system.;    For
the immediate future, Claytor predicts Amtrak will pay 80 percent of its bills
this year and 83 percent next year with income topping $1.3 billion.;    This
means that Amtrak's fleet of cars and locomotives, which now total 1,700, will
have to be expanded. Plans are afoot to buy 179 double-decked superliners, 269
single-deck viewliners and 243 locomotives.  </TEXT>
