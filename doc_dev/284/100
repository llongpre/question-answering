   A tape recording of data pulled from the wreck of
an Amtrak train may provide clues on the cause of a crash that
injured 267 people in the city's Back Bay Station, a federal
official said Saturday.
   Federal investigators thought at first a key portion of the tape
had been ruined by a long tone superimposed when Amtrak officials
examined it, said Susan Coughlin, National Transportation Safety
Board vice chairman.
   The tape holds an electronic record of the train's speed and
braking patterns.
   Investigators hope to verify the speed the Amtrak Night Owl from
Washington was traveling when it smashed into the rear of a
commuter train Wednesday, Coughlin said.
   Safety board officials estimate the train averaged 91.8 mph the
last 1\ mile before it derailed on a curve leading into the
station.
   The train engineer has told investigators the train's brakes
appeared to fail when he tried to slow the train as it approached
the station.
   Robert Herman, Amtrak general manager of transportation
services, said the train was well within the speed limit before it
derailed. The speed limit in that final section is 100 mph but
drops to 30 mph at the curve, the NTSB has said.
   Safety board spokesman Brent Bahler emphasized that the train's
speed has not been firmly established. He said he could not comment
on why Herman said the train was traveling under the speed limit.
   Efforts to reach Amtrak officials in Washington for
clarification Saturday night were unsuccessful.
   One of two event recorders on the Amtrak train was destroyed in
the crash. Safety board officials said earlier this week that the
tape from the second recorder did not record information for the
last 5 miles of the trip, rendering it useless.
   But Friday, Coughlin said Amtrak officials had apparently placed
an electronic tone over the tape while examining it in an attempt
to mark certain data. Lab technicians will now try to lift the tone
to get at the data underneath.
   Herman said Saturday the tape was only handled by top level
Boston-based Amtrak officials after the accident. He said Amtrak
made a copy before turning the tape over to NTSB investigators.
   Herman said the steady tone indicated no change in speed for the
train's final five miles.
   ``I would be surprised'' if it was determined that someone at
Amtrak intentionally placed the long tone on the tape, Herman said.
   The Amtrak train was carrying about 200 passengers and the
commuter train had standing room only with about 900 passengers
when it crashed.
   Seven people injured in the crash remained hospitalized
Saturday, including engineer trainee, Richard Abramson, 41, of
Trumbull, Conn., and head engineer Willis Copeland, 53, of Bethany,
Conn.
   Copeland tested negative for alcohol and drugs, Coughlin said.
The roles of Abramson and Copeland in the accident are also part of
the investigation.
   Most of the wreckage from both trains was removed by Saturday.
   Herman said Amtrak would complete repairs on the tunnel track by
Wednesday and would run tests with unoccupied trains before
resuming full commuter and Amtrak train service later in the week.
