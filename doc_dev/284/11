   The nation's railroads routinely use freight
and passenger cars with defective brakes, wheels and undercarriages
despite warnings from safety inspectors, according to a newspaper
report.
   Business pressures have created a tug-of-war between inspectors
who order cars repaired in the shop and transportation employees
who schedule trains, said Peter Brawley, assistant general foreman
of Amtrak's coach yard at Philadelphia's 30th Street Station.
   ``I'm not going to tell you that there aren't cars getting out
of here that shouldn't be moving. It happens,'' Brawley told The
Pittsburgh Press in an article published Wednesday.
   ``An inspector finds something wrong and wants to shop the car,
but transportation needs that car for a train leaving in three
hours, so the car goes out,'' he said.
   In addition to Amtrak, the nation's only long-distance passenger
rail line, problems were found with Conrail and CSX freight trains,
the Press said.
   However, the newspaper did not link any train derailments or
other major service problems to the defects.
   Wayne Geist, an engineer on Amtrak's Broadway Limited on the
Pittsburgh-Harrisburg leg of its Chicago-New York run, said he was
ordered June 19 not to slow down despite repeatedly reporting that
his speedometer did not work.
   ``I'm talking about taking a train loaded with 400 or 500
passengers up and down the steepest grades in Pennsylvania, where a
difference of 5 or 10 mph will not only violate Conrail's, Amtrak's
and the (federal) rules, but also endanger the passengers,'' Geist
said.
   Amtrak Chairman W. Graham Claytor said his company runs ``safe
operations,'' although conditions are not ideal.
   ``Business is so good we overutilize our equipment,'' he said.
``We have a whole lot of mechanical failures on the road, more than
we should. We turn around equipment too fast, but we can't let it
lay over 48 hours. If we do that, a lot of people are not going to
be able to ride.
   ``But ... we are not going to cut corners on safety or on our
basic maintenance policy,'' Claytor said.
   The Press said it learned that one Amtrak car was used between
Harrisburg and Philadelphia from June 18 until July 5 even though
inspectors had found a steel wheel marked by a heat crack that
could have caused the wheel to shatter.
   The newspaper said three cars that derailed in the 30th Street
Station yard June 29 were sent out unrepaired on a Philadelphia-New
York run despite Amtrak policy requiring the replacement of any
wheels that leave the track.
   ``There was a serious mistake made by releasing those three
cars,'' said Robert Burk, chief mechanical officer of the federally
subsidized rail service.
   The Press said it documented similar problems a week later in
Chicago on Amtrak's California Zephyr bound for San Francisco, the
Empire Builder bound for Seattle and the Capitol Limited bound for
Washington, D.C.
   At Conrail's giant Enola yard at Harrisburg, the newspaper said
it observed a man in a supervisor's white hardhat in mid-June
remove nine tags that inspectors had attached to freight cars to
indicate the need for major repairs.
   All nine cars were returned to service despite the defects,
which the newspaper said included a cracked undercarriage on a
tanker.
   Similar activity was documented at Conrail yards in Buffalo,
N.Y., Conway, Pa., and Columbus, Ohio, the newspaper said.
   Donald Rugh, an Ohio Public Utility Commission rail inspector,
said: ``I get the Conrail trains that come out of Conway when they
get into Canton, and they are loaded with defects. I have found 25
or 30 on a single train, ranging the full gamut from bad air brakes
to broken handholds.''
   Richard Hasselman, Conrail's vice president for operations,
responded that he believes inspections are being conducted properly
because supervisors make spot checks regularly.
   Hasselman said cars are tagged sometimes for repairs that aren't
needed and sometimes no defects are found on a tagged car.
   The Press cited its own observations and inspectors' records in
reporting that CSX freight cars with defects ranging from
inoperable brakes to cracked couplers were allowed to roll from
yards in Atlanta, Nashville, Hazard, Ky., and other locations.
   However, A. Crane Jones, a senior vice president at CSX,
retorted:
   ``If we find any supervisor doing that, or allowing this to be
done, well ... we have a saying on the railroad that we would
almost make a milepost out of him.''
