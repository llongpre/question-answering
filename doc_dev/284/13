   A jury found Amtrak guilty Thursday of
dumping raw sewage into Florida waterways in the national rail
passenger line's first such criminal trial.
   The state filed charges after Amtrak refused to stop dumping raw
human wastes from moving trains onto the tracks and into the St.
Johns River and Rice Creek.
   The six-member jury deliberated 1{ hours Thursday before
returning a guilty verdict on four counts of commercial littering.
   Amtrak contended federal law exempts it from state pollution
control laws. The dumping practice, dating back more than a
century, has also come under fire in several Western states.
   ``I'm surprised and disappointed in the verdict,'' said Amtrak's
attorney, Edward Booth of Jacksonville. ``I think it's unfair for
the law to send mixed signals.''
   Booth said Amtrak would appeal the decision ``just as quick as
you're looking at daylight.''
   Amtrak also faced one count of creating or allowing a nuisance
to health, but 7th Circuit Judge Robert Perry remanded it to Putnam
County Court, saying that prosecutors failed to prove anyone's
health was endangered. A trial on that count will be set later.
   Amtrak has 20 days to file a motion for a new trial on the
littering convictions. Sentencing was set for Jan. 19. Amtrak could
be prohibited from dumping and fined up to $5,000 on each count.
The charges also carry a possible prison term of five years on each
count, though no individual was named in the case.
   ``We are asking for injunction immediately (to stop Amtrak from
dumping),'' said State Attorney John Tanner. ``But it's obvious
that the judge is not going to act until the sentencing date.''
   The federally supported passenger railroad had threatened to
suspend service to Florida, where it serves about 1 million
passengers a year, if the state continued pressing its case.
   However, Jeff Moon, assistant general counsel for Amtrak, said
following the verdict that no decision has been made to pull the
rail service out of Florida.
   Tanner earlier had indicated if a guilty verdict were returned:
``I don't think it will immediately affect rail service in Florida.
I think in the long run it will ultimately lead to the end of the
practice of dumping sewage in the waterways throughout the
country.''
   Many of Amtrak's 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by
dumping directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by
spraying the contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains
are traveling at least 35 miles per hour.
   In his closing argument, Booth admitted Amtrak had dumped human
waste on bridges crossing waterways in Putnam County, but said the
practice was allowed under federal law.
   The company said in a federal court motion in Jacksonville that
enforcement of the state law would impose undue burdens on Amtrak,
but no hearings were held on the motion and Perry refused to delay
trial pending a federal ruling.
   The defense called Amtrak's president and chief executive
officer, W. Graham Claytor Jr., as their only witness during the
week-long trial. Claytor said Amtrak recognized the dumping
problem, but that the federally funded rail line could do little
until Congress appropriated more money for holding tanks or new
cars.
   Claytor estimated it would take about $1 million to equip the
current cars with the new system or $2 million to install it in new
cars.
   The prosecution said Amtrak could not hide behind the law passed
by Congress in 1976 and ignore environmental laws in Florida.
   ``Congress needs to know the state of Florida will not allow
Amtrak _ the federal government _ to dump raw sewage in the waters
of Florida,'' Tanner said. ``They (Amtrak) are trying to stretch
the law to say something it doesn't.''
