   The head of the Federal Railroad
Administration says the fact no one was killed in the collision of
an Amtrak passenger train and a commuter train in Boston proves
that modern railroad equipment is crashworthy and saves lives.
   FRA Administrator Gilbert E. Carmichael said that is true even
though 264 people were injured when the passenger train from
Washington derailed and rammed the commuter train in Boston's Back
Bay station Wednesday.
   ``This is a beautiful demonstration of how an accident in the
railroad industry can shake up a lot of people and injure people
but also save lives; there were no fatalities,'' Carmichael said in
an interview.
   ``This accident was dramatic; it was a messy accident,''
Carmichael said. ``But the trains performed beautifully in
protecting people. The equipment performed as it was designed. And
it is designed to take it.''
   Carmichael noted that only a handful of those injured required
hospitalization. Both locomotives derailed and were damaged beyond
repair, he said.
   Meanwhile, investigators for the National Transportation Safety
Board said they were probing possible similarities between
Wednesday's accident and a 1987 crash in which two commuter trains
collided in the same Boston station.
   Carmichael said inspectors from his agency also were looking
into the cause of the derailment and collision.
   ``At this point it's a mystery,'' Carmichael said, adding that
it may take several days to learn what went wrong.
   The FRA also subjected the train crews to alcohol and drug
tests, mandatory after all serious rail accidents. The results will
not be available for several days.
   In Wednesday's accident, Amtrak's Night Owl passenger train from
Washington smashed into the crowded commuter train during the
morning rush hour.
   Amtrak said the Night Owl apparently ``derailed on a curve and
went into the side of the ... train on an adjacent track.''
   In the 1987 Boston accident, an Amtrak-operated, Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority commuter train was standing at the
platform of the Back Bay station unloading passengers during
morning rush hour. It was struck from the rear by another
Amtrak-operated commuter train.
   That accident injured 110 people.
   After an investigation, the NTSB concluded that the probable
cause of the accident was the display of an improper wayside signal
resulting from an improperly designed signal system.
   It also blamed the failure of an engineer to act on a danger
signal and the failure of Amtrak supervisors to follow up on
reported signal failures.
   ``We will be looking at the 1987 accident and this one to see if
there are any similarities,'' said safety board spokesman Brent N.
Bahler.
   The board investigates all major transportation accidents in the
United States, pinpoints a probable cause for each and makes
corrective but non-binding recommendations.
   NTSB officials pointed out that a 1987 board recommendation,
calling for a federal rule requiring installation of a control
system on mainline tracks to provide for the positive separation of
all trains, has never been implemented.
   The recommendation emerged from investigations of several
serious rail accidents in the last few years, including the Jan. 4,
1987 crash of an Amtrak passenger train and Conrail freight
locomotives at Chase, Md., near Baltimore.
   That accident, the worst in Amtrak's history, killed 16 people
and injured 175.
