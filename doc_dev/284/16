   Amtrak claims in a federal lawsuit the
state shouldn't be allowed to prosecute the rail service on criminal
charges over the dumping of human waste from train toilets.
   ``The enforcement of the statutes in question would impose undue
burdens on Amtrak, the only interstate passenger railroad, and
threaten the continuation of intercity passenger service in
Floria,'' said Amtrak lawyers Robert Warren and Edward Booth.
   Some train cars used by the national passenger service dump waste
directly onto railroad bridges and overpasses when toilets are
flushed. Other cars have tanks that automatically release waste onto
tracks when a train reaches a speed of 25 mph.
   Amtrak contends in the lawsuit filed Tuesday that federal laws
governing rail service supersede state laws under which prosecutor
John Tanner filed charges. The railroad is asking U.S. District
Judge Howell W. Melton to halt prosecution in Circuit Court, calling
the charges an unconstitutional hindrance to interstate commerce.
   Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer rejected Amtrak's argument
and said the state would press on with the case.
   The railroad already had pleaded innocent to the dumping charges.
   Amtrak operates 12 trains daily in Florida. Six pass through
Putnam County by crossing the St. Johns River and Rice Creek.
   Tanner filed the charges after fishermen complained they were
sprayed with sewage beneath a trestle.
