CONSUMER REPORT: AMTRAK AGAIN ASKING FOR PERMANENT FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress again has been asked to establish a "dedicated funding source" to 
support Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail operator. 
</P>
<P>
In his annual budget request to the Senate Appropriations Committee, Amtrak 
President Graham Claytor asked the government for $712 million in funding and 
equipment purchase and improvement grants for fiscal 1989-90. That's $132 
million more than the current funding level. A decision may be forthcoming 
before Congress adjourns this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Claytor, in an effort to end his yearly "cap-in-hand" appeal to 
legislators, proposed -- and not for the first time -- that a special trust 
fund, supported by the gasoline tax, be established to maintain the passenger 
rail system in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The money would go to Amtrak, and the federal government would not have to 
haggle each year over Amtrak financing. 
</P>
<P>
Claytor's proposal has been turned down before. Some observers believe, 
however, that his chances of trust fund approval improves every day. 
</P>
<P>
Many transportation experts are attaching new importance to passenger train 
service, mostly because of what is happening in other modes of travel. 
</P>
<P>
Many of our interstate highways, local roads and bridges are badly in need of 
upgrading. The federal government has acknowledged this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airports Jammed 
</P>
<P>
Our airports are jammed. They need massive and rapid expansion to cope with the 
expected increase in volume. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this environment that Claytor made his latest appeal for funding until 
such time as Amtrak might be able to make a profit. His reasoning, and that of 
other Amtrak boosters, is sound. 
</P>
<P>
Trains are clean and energy-efficient, probably more so than any other mode of 
transportation. They are safe and reliable and relieve traffic pressure on 
freeways and airways. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak has become the nation's sixth-largest carrier, trailing only four 
airlines and Greyhound buses. It transported 22 million people last year. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak's survival will not be cheap. Track maintenance is costly. The rail 
operator's major problem right now, however, is a chronic shortage of rolling 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Without equipment, expansion is impossible. Without expansion, Amtrak's chances 
of getting by without a government subsidy are slim. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion opportunities exist. Claytor said that six states are asking Amtrak 
to establish new routes. The states were turned down only because Amtrak had no 
trains available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
No real expansion can be undertaken when Amtrak is dependent on the good will 
of Congress for its funding. There even have been times when some congressmen 
have called for an end to all Amtrak subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
A certain irony exists in the proposal that the trust be funded by a gasoline 
tax. Those who pay the tax would be helping to build and expand an alternative 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
They may find one day that such a system could whisk them to Southland cities 
in 125 m.p.h. comfort, far from the crush of freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak's business has been improving. The rail operator's passenger loads are 
up 20% in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in that same period, Amtrak has reduced its dependency on government 
assistance from more than half of its costs to just 30% in the last fiscal 
year. So encouraging have the results been that a bill before Congress seeks 
binding government support. 
</P>
<P>
The dozen senators who authored the bill said that such a commitment was 
necessary in the interests of "a balanced transportation system." 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of sentiment in Congress, with the states calling for new rail 
transportation services, and with no immediate end to the problems of our 
congested airports and freeways, Claytor's call for permanent funding may 
finally be answered.
