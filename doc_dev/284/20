   Amtrak trains are unaffected by President
Bush's veto of a bill authorizing $2 billion in spending for the
passenger rail service. The president's objection deals with a
provision on who can buy railroads.
   It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He returned 10 bills to
Congress in his first year in office last year. Congress has yet to
override a Bush veto.
   Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said the veto would not affect
daily train operations because the railroad is working with money
that Congress already had appropriated for 1989-1992.
   Bush took issue with a provision that would require the
Interstate Commerce Commission to approve the acquisition of
railroads by non-railroad companies.
   ``This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the
financial restructuring of the railroad industry,'' Bush told
Congress in a veto message Thursday.
   The veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter line
between Washington, D.C., and its northern Virginia suburbs, Black
said. The bill contained technical provisions necessary for the
project to open.
   The legislation, sent to Bush May 10, would authorize a new,
three-year government subsidy of $2 billion to Amtrak, the national
rail passenger service. Actual spending levels are set by separate
appropriations bills.
   Black said Amtrak supports the provision that prompted Bush's
veto, although it applies only to private freight railroads.
   The spokesman said Amtrak relies on private freight lines for
its tracks outside the Northeast corridor and ``does support ICC
oversight of takeovers of railroads by non-railroad companies.''
   Bush attributed the ``rejuvenation of the rail industry since
1980'' largely to an easing of burdensome federal regulations. He
said the Amtrak bill would reverse that trend.
   The bill ``contains an unprecedented new regulatory review
requirement and represents a step backward for the entire rail
industry,'' Bush said.
   He said the additional regulation ``would interfere with the
ability of the nation's largest freight railroads to obtain needed
capital or to change existing capital structure.''
   The provision also would impose a new barrier to any attempted
takeover of a rail line by the carrier's own management or
employees, Bush said.
   The president said existing law provides adequate protection of
the public interest in rail acquisitions.
   Bush administration officials had complained earlier that the
bill amounted to a government subsidy of about $29 a passenger.
However, Bush did not refer to the measure's cost in his veto
message.
   A presidential veto can be overridden only by two-thirds
majorities of both the House and Senate. Rather than try to
override the Amtrak veto, Congress more likely will remove the
provision that Bush finds objectionable and return the modified
bill to the White House for his signature.
