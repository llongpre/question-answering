   Federal investigators found ``slight
indications'' of rail movement Tuesday where an Amtrak passenger
train derailed, and the fireman at the controls felt the 16-car
train drag moments before it crashed.
   Investigators said the train apparently was traveling within the
speed limit when eight cars left the tracks Monday afternoon,
injuring 95.
   About a dozen people remained hospitalized Tuesday. There were
no deaths.
   Amtrak's California Zephyr with 396 passengers and a crew of 24
was headed to Chicago from the West Coast when it derailed in
southeastern Iowa on track owned by the Burlington Northern
Railroad. The number of passengers and injured was revised from
Monday.
   Susan Coughlin, vice-chairwoman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said investigators discovered ``slight indications''
of rail movement, either from lack of ballast or wet soil, as the
train entered a crossing grade at Batavia. She declined to draw any
conclusions.
   ``They are looking for evidence of movement in the track
structure,'' Ms. Coughlin said at a news conference. ``We are not
in a position at this point to interpret any of the findings.''
   She said a fireman who also was a qualified engineer was at the
controls when the train derailed, which ``is not an abnormal
situation at all.''
   ``The fireman who was operating as the engineer felt the train
drag. Up to that point, they detected nothing abnormal in the
performance of the train.
   ``He looked back and saw that the rear cars were swaying. He put
his train then into an emergency braking,'' she said.
   Ms. Coughlin declined to say whether the braking action was the
correct procedure, or if it saved lives and kept injuries to a
minimum.
   An eight-member team from the NTSB is leading the investigation,
which involves about 40 officials from the Federal Railroad
Administration, the Iowa Department of Transportation, Amtrak, the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Burlington Northern.
   The 24-member crew, including a conductor, two assistant
conductors, an engineer and the fireman, was tested for drug and
alcohol use and those results were expected in about two days, she
said.
   The NTSB will concentrate its efforts Wednesday to a switching
device in Batavia and a 1,240-foot stretch of track from where the
train passed the grade crossing to where it derailed, she said.
   Behind the investigators, crews went to work on the twisted rail
and gouged right-of-way in this town of 525 people, 90 miles
southeast of Des Moines. The double-track route was not expected to
be reopened until late Wednesday.
   Ms. Coughlin the crash caused $1.7 million damage to the train
and $75,000 to the track.
   The damaged cars were taken to Fairfield, about 15 miles east of
Batavia, for inspection and repair. The three locomotives and eight
other undamaged cars headed east to Chicago.
   Amtrak and American Red Cross representatives loaded two buses
with about 40 passengers who stayed overnight in Ottumwa, about 10
miles west of Batavia, and sent them to Chicago. Carol Grant, field
service manager for the Red Cross, said those were the last of the
passengers who were aboard the Zephyr.
   At Jefferson County Hospital in Fairfield, a spokeswoman said
two of the nine patients admitted overnight were released Tuesday
morning. The remaining patients were all in good, stable condition.
   Skip Deskin, vice president of Ottumwa Regional Medical Center,
said at least three of the nine patients who stayed overnight were
discharged Tuesday morning with more expected to be released soon.
