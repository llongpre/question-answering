   Grand pianos and haute cuisine.
Mahogany and gold. A Florida company is bringing European-style
luxury trains to the U.S. rails _ for a price.
   Refurbished Pullman cars will carry passengers coddled by an
on-board staff between Chicago and Washington, D.C., beginning Nov.
15. The cars will be pulled behind Amtrak's regularly scheduled
train over the route.
   A preview excursion between Panama City and Atlanta is set to
leave Friday with about 55 passengers for a one-time trip.
   American-European Express Railway Co. patterned the luxury
service after the storied Orient Express and its modern-day
recreation. Edy Zuger, chief executive officer of Nostalgie
Istanbul Orient Express of Zurich, Switzerland, which operates
luxury trains in Europe and Asia, is a partner in the $15 million
venture.
   Ten refurbished Pullman cars dating to the 1930s have been given
leather and mahagony interiors trimmed with brass and 24 karat
gold. Two club cars feature grand pianos. Dining cars will serve
seven-course meals on fine china.
   Passengers will have access to a fax machine and telephone along
the Chicago-Washington route that was picked in part for its
scenery, said Bill Spann, president of the Florida company. No
single seats will be available _ only sleeping compartments.
   ``Businessmen holding meetings, newlyweds, people having
affairs'' are some of the intended passengers, Spann said.
   The luxury cars will be hitched to regular Amtrak trains.
One-way fares for the cabins along the Chicago-Washington route
will range from $695 for a single to $1,450 for the biggest cabin,
called the ``Presidential.''
   Amtrak charges $103 to $356 one way between Chicago and
Washington, depending on whether the passenger is traveling in
coach or a sleeping car. Travelers on the Panama City-Atlanta
preview will pay $425 a person.
   It cost the company $1 million each to refurbish the Pullman
cars. All but one are completed.
   Spann, also president of Bay Point Yacht and Country Club in
Panama City Beach, said the service is the result of a chance
encounter he had with Zuger three years ago.
   Zuger had been looking for an American partner to set up a
luxury train operation in the United States. While vacationing at
Bay Point, he mentioned his plan to Spann, who said he would be
interested.
   Spann said he lined up investors to go into partnership with
Zuger's company, obtained the cars and made a deal to pay Amtrak up
to $5.6 million a year to pull them behind its regular Capitol
Limited.
