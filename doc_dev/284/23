   A derailed train was placed back
on track and passengers were bused on their way as investigators
probed the cause of an Amtrak derailment that stranded 309 people
overnight in a snowy canyon.
   Two of three locomotives and 15 passengers cars of the California
Zephyr derailed in heavy snow Sunday night, about eight miles east
of Glenwood Springs. The train, en route from Chicago to the West
Coast, remained upright.
   The 294 passengers and 15 crew members were stranded aboard the
train overnight but had heat and light, said John Jacobsen, Amtrak
director of public relations in Washington, D.C. A work train
brought the passengers here Monday in two trips aboard seven
cabooses.
   While railroad crews lifted the derailed train back onto the
tracks, most passengers went to Salt Lake City on four chartered
buses. About 25 people returned to Denver on another chartered bus.
   Officials from Amtrak, the Rio Grande and the National
Transportation Safety Board examined evidence at the wreck site. Rio
Grande leases track to Amtrak for the California Zephyr.
   ``We know the cars were forced off the track, but whether it was
the track or the equipment or something else, we won't know for
awhile,'' Jacobsen said.
   Earlier, Jacobsen said the rails on the roadbed 15 feet above the
Colorado River were ``spread apart enough to cause the wheels to
drop into a ridge between the rails.''
   Investigators will examine the equipment, the tracks, the speed
of the train and the weather, among other factors, officials said.
