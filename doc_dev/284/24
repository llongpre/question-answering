<LEADPARA>  An Amtrak train carrying nearly 450 people derailed Wednesday, sideswiping a
parked freight car and killing seven and injuring more than 75, authorities
said.;    It was the worst Amtrak accident since 1987, when 16 people were
killed in a wreck in Chase, Md. With the two recent derailments in California,
it was the nation's third major train derailment in two weeks.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The 18-car Silver Star was en route to New York from Miami with 426
passengers when the accident occurred about 5 a.m. It was drizzling at the
time.;    Hospitals reported treating 78 people, and at least five were in
critical condition, though Amtrak said there were 76 injuries. There were
about 20 crew members, none of whom was hurt, officials said.;    W. Graham
Claytor Jr., president and chairman of Amtrak, said in Washington that seven
people were killed and 76 injured. Of the 76 hurt, 58 were treated at a
hospital and released while 18 were hospitalized, he said.;    The train was
going about 70 mph, about 9 mph under the speed limit, said John Drake of CSX
Transportation, which owns the tracks. Amtrak said the train was traveling at
77 mph.;    Drake said the train wobbled for an unknown reason and slammed
into the freight hopper car parked on a siding. The train stopped about 100
yards away, listing at a 40-degree angle.;    Drake and other officials
declined to speculate whether rain was a factor.;    The freight car, loaded
with coal, sand and wood chips, cut deeply into the left side of the rear
passenger car, knocking out several seats and peeling back the car's aluminum
skin for about 25 feet.;    The two tracks are about 10 feet apart.;    "There
is no indication the train was being operated improperly," said Clifford
Black, a spokesman at Amtrak headquarters in Washington.;    Black said that
no bodies were left in the wreckage and that tracks appeared normal at the
derailment scene in woods near Camden, a town of 7,500 about 30 miles
northeast of Columbia.  </TEXT>
