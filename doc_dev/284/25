   For the sixth consecutive year the Republican
administration in Washington has proposed cutting off all subsidy
for Amtrak passenger rail service.
   And Congress, for the sixth straight year, is expected to refuse
to go along.
   President Bush last week carried on a longstanding tradition
established by his predecessor by proposing to cut the federal
Amtrak subsidy. The move would leave Amtrak about 28 percent shy of
what it says it needs to operate for fiscal 1991.
   Legislators in the Northeast accuse Bush of ignoring the
progress Amtrak has made in reducing its dependence on federal
money and of pursuing a policy that will lead to more crowded
highways and airports.
   ``It's a terrible decision,'' said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.
``With the amount of money that is to be saved compared to the
extraordinary public investment that's already gone into improving
the rail infrastructure ... it's really penny wise and pound
foolish.''
   Of Amtrak's $1.9 billion budget this year, $600 million was
supplied by the federal government. In 1981, the federal government
supplied about half of Amtrak's budget.
   ``We're talking about one B-2 worth of expenditures,'' Morrison
said.
   New England is one of the heavy beneficiaries of the
quasi-public rail line established in 1970 by Congress to replace
failing private lines.
   In Connecticut, Amtrak carries 1.2 million passengers per year,
and employs 727 state residents on a payroll of $25 million,
according to Amtrak statistics. Some 422,000 Rhode Island
passengers use the system each year and Amtrak employs 295
residents on $10 million in payroll.
   And in Massachusetts, where Amtrak also is responsible for
commuter service, 1.4 million passengers use the Amtrak system
along with 14 million commuters per year. Amtrak employs 1,710
Massachusetts residents and spends 55 million in payroll.
   Federal Railroad Administration spokeswoman Claire Austin said
the administration opposes a subsidy. But she said Bush strongly
supports rail transportation and she indicated there was no reason
to believe the scenario played out in previous years would change.
   ``We've always requested no subsidy and Congress always makes an
appropriation,'' Austin said.
   Unlike President Reagan, Austin said, Bush supports federal
spending for research into high-speed rail technology, equipment
and safety standards.
   ``That's a different twist that you have not seen in the Reagan
administration,'' according to Austin.
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., predicted Congress would again
disagree with the president on the Amtrak subsidy issue. But Shays
said Congress has the same goal: ``We will wean Amtrak from federal
subsidies and we'll appropriate a little less.''
   According to Amtrak, a gradual reduction in federal subsidies
could be accomplished without cutting into rail service.
   ``We've said publicly, and it's mentioned in the president's
budget, that Amtrak has a goal of being self-sufficient for
operational costs by the year 2000,'' said Amtrak spokesman
Clifford Black. The rail line will still need at least $150 million
per year for capital improvements, Black said.
   For now, Morrison said, Amtrak depends on federal subsidies for
survival and so does the region's transportation system.
   ``In the Northeast Corridor, the last thing we need to do is
dump more cars and more air traffic into an already congested
system,'' Morrison said.
