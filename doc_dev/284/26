<HEAD>Rail Workers Say Amtrak Trains Dump Waste on Them While They Repair
Bridge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve railroad workers have sued Amtrak,
alleging that passenger trains have dumped raw sewage on them while
they repaired a bridge.
   The workers claim in the lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court this
week, that they have been sprayed repeatedly by raw sewage since
1987 while working on a Portland-area railroad bridge over the
Willamette River.
   They say they have suffered flulike symptoms from exposure to
human waste and have ``extreme concern'' about working at that site.
The lawsuit alleges that Amtrak has continued the practice despite
workers' complaints.
   Amtrak officials have no comment on the lawsuit, said Clifford
Black, manager of public affairs for the National Railroad Passenger
Corp. in Washington, D.C., which runs Amtrak.
   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of problems Amtrak has had
in Oregon over its practice of dumping sewage from passenger trains
onto railroad tracks.
   The state Department of Environmental Quality recently fined the
train service $2,700 and demanded compliance with an Oregon law that
prohibits such dumping.
   Black said Amtrak would contest the penalty. Amtrak officials
have said in the past that under federal law, which they say
supersedes state law, they are not prohibited from dumping waste
onto tracks.
   Florida apparently is the only other state that has challenged
Amtrak on the dumping, said Sherman Olson of the environmental
agency.
