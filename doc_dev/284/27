   Amtrak is on a fast track to criminal court
after refusing to stop flushing toilet waste from trains.
   State Attorney John Tanner, who filed littering charges against
the passenger railroad, had offered to drop the three misdemeanor
counts if Amtrak agreed to stop dumping from trains passing over two
overwater trestles.
   But Amtrak, whichhas been dumping along its right of way under a
federal law that railroads have been using for more than a century,
contends federal law overrides state and local law. Clifford Black,
an Amtrak spokesman at its Washington headquarters, said Florida
risks losing service if it presses the case.
   An arraignment was scheduled Sept. 18. The charges carry fines of
up to $5,000 each.
   Amtrak's 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at
least 35 mph.
   Tanner tried to halt the practice only over the two trestles.
   Black said agreeing to Tanner's conditions would make Amtrak a
target for similar demands over every body of water in Florida.
``With the myriad waterways in Florida, it would be an impossible
situation,'' he said Monday.
   The railroad hopes to replace much of its fleet with new cars
equipped with holding tanks for all toilets. Black said it would
cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet.
   Amtrak fears having to hire a worker to stand in each car to
throw an override switch for toilets when the trains cross bodies of
water, Black said.
   Tanner said Amtrak is bluffing and could not afford to cut back
service in Florida or the Western states _ Oregon, Washington, Utah,
California and Nevada _ where it has also come under fire for its
sanitary habits.
   Black said that the criminal case is the only one of its kind
against Amtrak of which he is aware. Two civil cases are pending in
Oregon, he said.
