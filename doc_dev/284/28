   An Amtrak train operated by a trainee derailed and
slammed into a rush-hour commuter train in a tunnel Wednesday,
injuring 264 passengers in a crash so violent cars were flung into
the tunnel ceiling and buckled the road above.
   ``All the lights went out, people started screaming, the place
was filled with smoke, a few people were trapped under seats,''
said Chris Good, a passenger on the suburban Stoughton Line train.
   About 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel spilled and ignited after the
impact, sending dense smoke into the cars that passenger Joe Povoas
said ``you could grind with your teeth, you could spit it out.''
   Many passengers, dazed and covered with soot, wandered out of
the station, some crying, many assisted by emergency personnel.
   One elderly woman, her face black with soot and wearing no
shoes, asked police: ``Where's my luggage? Where are my shoes?''
   Ten people were in critical condition, including the engineer of
Amtrak's Night Owl train from Washington, D.C., said Jon Fasana,
director of the city's emergency services.
   Overall, 264 people, including four rescue workers, were hurt,
said Thomas Glynn, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority. The injured passengers were among 190
aboard the Amtrak train and about 900 on the commuter train. They
suffered from cuts and bruises, smoke inhalation, broken bones and
head injuries.
   An Amtrak trainee was operating the train under the supervision
of an engineer with 25 years' experience, said D.J. Beatty, general
supervisor for Amtrak. Richard Abramson had three years of training
and was qualified to operate the train under the guidance of the
engineer, Beatty said. Abramson regularly operated trains as part
of his training, Beatty said.
   Abramson was listed in stable condition at St. Elizabeth's
Hospital with a broken collarbone, an injured back and facial
injuries. The engineer, Willis Copeland, was in critical condition.
   Amtrak spokeswoman Marci Larson said Copeland was the engineer
in a head-on collision on a New York City trestle in July 1984 in
which one person was killed and 115 were injured, but that he was
``completely exonerated.''
   That was verified by news reports on the NTSB's investigation of
the accident.
   Federal officials were investigating Wedneday's accident, which
occurred in the same Back Bay station in downtown Boston as an
almost identical crash three years ago caused by a faulty signal
system.
   ``We'll be very interested in seeing if there are any
connections,'' said NTSB spokesman Brent Bahler.
   The Federal Railroad Administration also sent a team of
inspectors and administered mandatory alcohol and drug tests to the
crew. The results will not be available for several days.
   Glynn would not comment on recorders taken from the cabins of
both trains, which have been turned over to NTSB investigators. The
speed of the Amtrak train will be determined by analyzing cabin
data.
   The crash left parts of the two trains twisted ``like a coat
hanger,'' said Fire Lt. Mike Walsh, who arrived at the scene two
minutes after the first alarm.
   ``There was an eerie calm,'' Walsh said. He said he and other
firefighters gave their oxygen masks to victims.
   The commuter train, which originated in Stoughton, south of
Boston, was sitting on an adjacent track running in the same
direction as the Night Owl when it was hit toward the rear at
around 8:30 a.m., said Nancy Sterling Gleason, a transit authority
spokeswoman.
   The Night Owl, which left Washington at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday,
apparently derailed on a curve and went into the side of the other
train, said Clifford Black, a spokesman for Amtrak in Washington.
   Two engines, two passenger cars and two baggage cars on the
Night Owl derailed and smashed into the parked train, hitting the
engine that was in the rear of the commuter train.
   The Amtrak train jackknifed, hit the ceiling tunnel and broke
concrete and steel support pillars, said John Harrison, acting fire
commissioner.
   ``We were sitting on the train and the next thing - crash, bang,
boom,'' passenger Kathy Simons said just before she was carried
away on a stretcher to an ambulance. ``I ended up on the floor with
a seat on top of me.''
   A nearly identical crash occurred at the same station between an
Amtrak train and a commuter train in 1987. The NTSB determined that
crash was caused by an improperly designed signal system, with
human error considered a secondary factor.
   Transit Authority spokesman Jim Ball said that signal system was
repaired shortly after the accident.
   But for Phyllis Laorenza, the crash brought frightening memories
of the 1987 crash, which she also experienced as a passenger on a
commuter train.
   ``The first thing I thought of was, `No, I can't believe this is
happening to me again,''' Laorenza said. ``It was very scary.''
   Officials said the train station would be out of service through
the weekend while the wreckage was cleared away.
