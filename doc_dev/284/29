   Airports handling heavy Eastern Airlines traffic are
boosting police patrols, designating picket areas and mapping
contingency plans for the expected strike this weekend of the
airline's Machinists union.
   In South Florida, home region of the Miami-based carrier, all
three regional airports began planning days ahead of the Machinists'
strike deadline at 12:01 a.m. Saturday how to keep operations
running smoothly.
   In St. Paul, Minn., a federal judge issued an order barring
Northwest Airlines' 21,000-member Machinists' union from staging a
sympathy strike in the event of a walkout.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson said his temporary restraining
order ``is in the best interests of the public'' to avoid disrupting
flights.
   The order, which had been sought by the Eagan-based airline,
remains in effect until a March 13 hearing on whether to grant
Northwest's request for a preliminary injunction against the union.
   Guy Cook, chairman of the Machinists' local at Northwest, called
Magnuson's ruling ``another nail in the coffin of labor people.''
   At Miami International Airport, adjacent to Eastern's corporate
headquarters, extensive preparations have been made ``to maintain
the airport operating and protect the public's right of access to
the airport,'' according to Dade County Aviation Department
spokeswoman Amalia Fernandez.
   There will be heavy weekend staffing, strictly designated
picketing areas, extra tow trucks to keep ramps and roads clear, and
additional Metro-Dade police officers on duty throughout the
sprawling facility, Ms. Fernandez said.
   Additional staff will be assigned to airport terminals to help
stranded or delayed passengers, she said.
   On Thursday, a caravan of about 2,000 Machinists slowly drove
vehicles past the Miami airport terminal, causing a massive traffic
jam that angered airline passengers. Similar protests were held in
several other cities, including Newark, N.J.
   At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport north of
Miami, Broward County Sheriff's Lt. Jack Greeney, Executive Office
of the department's airport division, said he plans to double
airport deputy patrols Friday night.
   Greeney said he has been in touch with both the local Machinists'
union and Eastern management to seek cooperation in keeping heads
cool in the event of a strike.
   ``We've informed both of them we're not going to tolerate any
acts of violence from anyone,'' Greeney said.
   At Palm Beach International Airport, operations spokesman Jerry
Allen, like his counterparts at several other Eastern-linked
airports around the country, spent Thursday meeting with police and
city officials for strike preparations.
   Additional security arrangements also were established at
airports in Atlanta, Washington, Newark, Seattle and Philadelphia.
   In both Washington and Newark, officials expressed additional
concern over possible rail strikes in solidarity with Eastern's
machinists.
   In the New York area, commuter railroads are expecting to be hit
by a secondary strike if the Machinists walk out as threatened.
   The Long Island Rail Road, which has about 135,000 daily riders,
and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which carries 95,000 daily
commuters, both are vulnerable, along with New Jersey Transit and
freight railroads.
   In Washington, the head of Amtrak said the national passenger
railroad would continue limited operations for only a few days if
picketed by workers supporting any strike against Eastern.
   W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, also said that if
Eastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket the
railroad, Amtrak would add trains between New York and Washington
and possibly between New York and Boston.
   Amtrak spokesman R. Clifford Black in Washington said a strike in
the area by rail workers would affect 5,000 commuters who travel
daily by train into and out of the capital.
