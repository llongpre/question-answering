   Amtrak would have to suspend passenger
rail service to Florida if a judge rules that it must quit dumping
sewage from moving trains, Amtrak's president testified Monday.
   W. Graham Claytor Jr., Amtrak's president and chief operating
officer, was the first witness as three days of hearings began
before U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton.
   Melton is to decide if the national railroad can be prosecuted
for dumping waste in northern Florida waterways.
   Amtrak appealed to federal court after a state jury found Amtrak
guilty in early December of four felony counts of commercial
littering into the St. Johns River and Rice Creek.
   Amtrak cars now serving Florida either drop waste directly on
the track or put it into a holding tank which is dumped when the
train reaches a speed of 25 mph, Claytor said.
   With the present equipment owned by Amtrak, Claytor said it
would be impossible for it to continue service into Florida if
Melton rules in favor of the state.
   ``There is no way to comply,'' he said.
   He testified the railroad is studying ways to modify existing
cars and plans to equip new cars so sewage won't be dumped on the
tracks.
   But that's a long-term solution which will require Congress to
appropriate money and would not address the short-term problem of
cars dumping waste, Claytor said.
   ``In today's environment, it is better not to do it at all, and
we agree and we are working on it,'' he said.
   Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer said in his opening
arguments that the issue is whether federal law pre-empts state law
and ``whether Amtrak can continue to indiscriminately dump raw
human sewage into Florida's waterways.''
   ``This court should deny Amtrak's efforts to derail the state
criminal prosecution and allow Florida's courts to interpret laws
designed to protect the waters of the state and the citizens who
use the waters,'' Bayer said in his trial brief.
   Edward Booth, an attorney representing Amtrak, said Amtrak is
not subject to Florida's laws prohibiting the disposal of waste
from trains. He argued that allowing the state to enforce its laws
would interfere with interstate commerce.
   Melton blocked a Jan. 18 criminal sentencing of the railroad
pending the outcome of this hearing. If Melton rules that state law
applies to Amtrak, the railroad could be subject to about $20,000
in fines.
