   The derailment of an Amtrak passenger train
near Russell, Iowa, occurred last October after a workman failed to
restore a track switch to its proper position, a federal
investigation concluded Tuesday.
   The two locomotives and 11 of 14 passenger cars of Amtrak's
``California Zephyr'' collided with maintenance equipment on a side
track, injuring 15 crew members and 107 of the 230 passengers
aboard.
   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded in its report
on the Oct. 12, 1987, accident that a laborer who had used the
maintenance equipment had parked it on a siding, but failed to
return the switch for through-traffic use.
   Blood and urine samples from the Burlington Northern Railroad
workman later showed small traces of marijuana, but the levels were
so small that the board could not link drug use specifically to the
accident.
   The board also blamed the crane operator and a track forman for
failing to check the switch and criticized the management of the
Burlington Northern Railroad, which owns the track, for inadequate
training of maintenance crews and not reducing the track speed in
the work area.
   The safety board also said that a signal banner at the switch,
which would have warned the Amtrak engineer that he was about to
head onto a track siding, was so rusted that it was difficult to
see.
   The Amtrak train, traveling about 60 miles an hour, went onto
the side track and plowed into the equipment, which included a
maintenance crane and three flat cars, the safety board said.
   The eastbound Zephyr was traveling on the westbound track at the
time of the accident because a stretch of the eastbound track had
been closed for repairs.
   The board also said that the severity of some of the passengers'
injuries was increased because items like television sets, coffee
makers and seat cushions broke free inside the Amtrak cars during
the accident.
