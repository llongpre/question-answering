<LEADPARA>  NO, train travel is not what it used to be during the golden age of
railroading. But it's getting closer to the glory days of the 1930s and '40s.
The folks at Amtrak are trying -- at least in little ways.;    Real plates,
glasses and silverware are making a comeback in some diners. Amtrak is
distributing a slick 89-page brochure offering hotel, national park and even
"rail-sail" packages. Smokers have been banished from passenger cars to one
section of the lounge car -- good news for non-smokers anyway. The debut of
new cars with improved plumbing systems is only a few years away. And for the
most part, Amtrak employees who work the trains have actually become helpful
and pleasant.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But without a doubt the biggest step toward making America's rails
user-friendly again is the new fare partnership between Amtrak and United
Airlines.;    The 7-month-old program, which allows long-distance travelers to
take the train one way and fly back, is already considered a huge success by
railroad officials, who say the program will be expanded.;    "What we find is
that it really does appeal to people who are not so familiar with the train,"
Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Kelly said. "Time is really a factor and they don't
know if they're going to like it, either.";    The special fares -- which also
allow travelers to fly to an area, travel around it by rail and then fly home
-- have attracted more than 10,000 bookings since January, Kelly said.;   
Other packages -- which combine rail travel with deals on hotels, cruises and
tours of national parks and historic areas -- have attracted an additional
20,000 passengers, she said.;    The air/rail fares, which range from $389 to
$499 for summer travel, provide a good deal of flexibility, but they won't
work to and from every city. Unless you enjoy logistical problem-solving, call
your travel agent. The fares, incidentally, will drop by $30 to $80 in
mid-September.;    To get a head start, send for "Amtrak's America: The Rail
Travel Planner." The free brochure is available from: Amtrak Distribution
Center, P.O. Box 7717, Itasca, Ill. 60143. If you want to book your own
air/rail fare, call Amtrak's Great American Vacations at (800) 321-8684.;   
As popular as the packages are, they represent only a small percentage of the
impressive increase in ridership numbers Amtrak has shown in the two decades
since it took control of the nation's rail passenger system. Last year, 22.2
million people took the train, breaking a record set just a year earlier.;   
The new record won't last either, said Amtrak spokesman Howard Robertson, who
said ridership this spring was up 3 to 5 percent over a year ago.;    The
federally subsidized railroad is expected to cover 80 percent of its operating
cost this year, Kelly said, up 5 percent from a year ago. By the year 2000,
the railroad expects to earn its entire operating budget. The railroad will
still seek taxpayer help for new equipment, including 140 new double-decker
cars that will run on western routes beginning in 1993.;    Indeed, the
national railroad has come a long way since 1971, when it carried 17 million
passengers. It has improved substantially since the day in the late '70s when
two teen-age travelers were shooed out of a dining car with the admonition:
"We don't need any Greyhound rejects around here.";    Now, you're likely to
be treated not just as a passenger, but as a customer -- one that Amtrak would
dearly like to see on a train again.;     If you go . . .; THE backbone of
Amtrak's long-distance train fares is the All Aboard America fare. The system
breaks the country into three regions -- roughly from Oakland to Denver,
Denver to Chicago and Chicago to the East Coast. The fares allow passengers to
travel anywhere in the regions, making as many as three stops. The rates
depend on the number of regions a passenger travels in and through.;    A
ticket for coach travel anywhere in one region is $189. The fare for travel
within two adjoining sections is $269. The fare for three sections is $339.
Passengers are allowed 45 days to complete travel. In mid-September, All
Aboard fares will drop to $179, $229 and $259, respectively.;    Optional
sleeping accommodations can add considerably to the cost of a trip. For
instance, an economy sleeper -- which can sleep two and means sharing a
washroom with other sleeper passengers -- would add $388 each way to the
two-night trip from Oakland to Chicago. Keep in mind that prices for sleepers
vary widely depending on the route, the distance, the time of year and the
type of room requested. Call your travel agent, or Amtrak at (800) USA-RAIL,
for more information.;    -- Mike Cassidy  </TEXT>
