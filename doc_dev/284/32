Amtrak, the heavily loss-making operator of US passenger train services,
ended a dismal year with the yawning gap between its costs and revenues
widening still further to Dollars 731m in 1993, its annual report shows.
The state-owned corporation also performed poorly in getting its customers
to their destinations on time, with only 79 per cent of its short-distance
trains and 47 per cent of its long-distance services arriving punctually.
Although the number of passengers carried rose from 21.3m to 22.1m, revenues
of Dollars 1.4bn were far exceeded by expenses of Dollars 2.1bn, with the
result that Amtrak lost Dollars 33 for every ticket sold.
The year also brought the worst accident in Amtrak's history when the Sunset
Limited express from Los Angeles to Miami plunged into an alligator-infested
Alabama swamp in September, killing 47 people.
Technically known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak was
set up by the federal government in 1971 to run the nation's loss-making
passenger train services.
These had previously been operated by the private railroad companies, which
now concentrate on their profitable freight operations and continue to own
the tracks.
Amtrak was expected to reach a position where revenues at least covered its
operating costs, but has proved unable to compete with air or road transport
for speed or convenience and has continued to rely on federal support for
its survival.
The annual report shows that the corporation is due to receive Dollars
771.7m in federal funds this year, of which Dollars 351.7m is earmarked for
operating losses and the rest for capital spending. But these sums are
unlikely to reverse the steady decline in Amtrak's physical assets, which
are ageing more rapidly than the corporation can afford to replace them.
