<TEXT>     Not bad for a place where, until just a few years ago, lumbering CalTrain
cars to San Francisco were virtually the only rail ticket in town.;   The
reason for the change is the proposed $98.6 million state-of-the-art Pullman
Way rail maintenance yard at Capitol Expressway and Monterey Highway in San
Jose. Designers will begin planning the yard next month, the first such
facility constructed west of Chicago in this century. Construction is expected
to be completed in three years.;   "San Jose, rail hub of Northern California
-- it's not far-fetched," said Jim Gallagher, deputy executive director of the
Joint Powers Board. "If you are going to operate a line for the public, you
need a quality maintenance facility nearby. This can be it.";   Earthquakes
and geography have also added to San Jose's luster.;   After the Loma Prieta
quake flattened Oakland's Cypress structure, Amtrak was told its repair yard
there would have to go once the highway was rerouted. Amtrak, which until the
addition of the Sacramento trains only ran its two Coast Starlight trains
through San Jose, was suddenly interested in the new rail yard.;   "The
potential is something," said Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black from Washington,
D.C. "San Jose trains could connect with the San Joaquin line, with the
California Zephyr to Chicago.";   CalTrain likes the idea because it currently
must send locomotives to Roseville, northeast of Sacramento, for repairs.;  
"They're gone for three to six days," said Rebecca Shaffer of the California
Department of Transportation, the project manager for the Pullman Way yard.
"And once we get four locomotives out of service, we start canceling trains.";
  By 1995, San Jose could sport two daily trains to Chicago, six to
Bakersfield and six more to Sacramento. In addition, Amtrak has the inside
track to operate CalTrain service on the Peninsula, and that will expand from
the current 54 trains to as many as 96, eventually including service to Gilroy
and possibly Monterey. Even if it does not win the bidding for CalTrain, Black
said Amtrak service to Monterey through San Jose is a possibility.;   The
Sacramento run is the first visible result of $3 billion in rail bonds voters
approved under Propositions 108 and 116 in June 1990. Each of the three
passenger coaches will have a food car, but the line is not expected to
include many daily commuters because it will take three hours, 15 minutes one
way. But officials hope it will attract people on business or leisure trips.; 
 The goal is an average 1,400 passengers a day during the first year, doubling
by 1994. Ten round trips are planned by the end of the decade, serving 6,000
passengers a day. By then, high-speed trains could shorten the trip to 2 1/2
hours, close to what it takes by car now. And with congestion expected to
increase along Interstate 80 throughout the decade, hopping a train may gain
acceptance.;   But an immediate plus for South Bay commuters is that the one
hour, 10 minute San Jose-Oakland leg is the first direct passenger rail
connection between the two cities since 1962. Up to now, a rail commute to the
East Bay meant first driving or busing to Fremont to catch BART.;   By next
spring, a person living in Gilroy can take CalTrain to San Jose, switch to
light rail at the Tamien Station and commute to work in North San Jose. Or
take CalTrain to the Cahill Street Station and ride to a job in Oakland on
Amtrak.;   Also down the line is a station in the Tri-Cities.;   Fremont is
touting the old Centerville Train Station as a stop, while Union City is
proposing to build a brand new station near the Bay Area Rapid Transit
District station.;   "It's kind of hard to say what will happen in terms of
additional service because we've got to get the service up and running,"
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said. More stations will be approved; "it's just
a question of when and where."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Tickets for the San Jose
to Sacramento train may be bought at any station or buy calling
1-800-USA-RAIL. No reservations are required.; Capitol Corridor;   The Capitol
Corridor rail line will connect San Jose and Sacramento for the first time in
30 years.;   (box)When: Inauguration ceremonies are at 8:15 a.m. Wednesday at
Cahill Station in San Jose; 9:45 a.m. in Hayward at end of Cannery Street; and
10:45 a.m. in Oakland's Jack London Square. Ceremonies also are planned at
other stops. Regular service begins Thursday, with a trip from San Jose to
Sacramento taking three hours, 15 minutes.;   (box)Cost: $10 one way and $15
round trip from San Jose to Oakland, Berkeley or Richmond; $15 and $22 to
Suisun-Fairfield; $23 and $30 to Davis or Sacramento. From Jan. 7 through
April 9, a special round-trip ticket will cost $1 more than one-way fare.;

Cruz.;   (box)If no ticket: Just hop aboard and pay. The ticket will cost $5
