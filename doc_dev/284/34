   President Bush's nominee to head the Federal
Railroad Administration says he supports phasing out Amtrak funding
rather than abruptly cutting it off as proposed in the president's
budget.
   Gilbert E. Carmichael said during a Senate hearing Tuesday that
if confirmed, he would not push for a cutoff of Amtrak funding next
year.
   The Reagan administration tried for several years to get
Congress to drop the subsidy of the increasingly successful
passenger rail system, but Congress has kept the funding. The cut
also is proposed in Bush's fiscal 1990 budget.
   Amtrak is seeking a $656 million subsidy for fiscal 1990, which
begins Oct. 1. The railroad took in a record $1.1 billion in
revenue on its own last year.
   Sen. James Exon, who chaired the hearing, praised Carmichael's
position and said his nomination has wide support among committee
members. The hearing was held by the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
   ``I'm pleased to recognize your support for Amtrak,'' said Exon,
D-Neb.
   Carmichael said he agreed with Exon's assessment that his
position meant he would seek self-sufficiency for Amtrak ``a few
years down the road,'' rather than in the next year.
   Carmichael is a Meridian, Miss., automobile dealer and real
estate developer with wide experience in regional rail issues.
   Carmichael has served for the past four months as a consultant
in the Transportation Department, preparing for approval of his
nomination.
   ``I am committed to the preservation of a national rail
passenger network as part of a balanced transportation system and
helping it to be self-supporting and a vital part of the 21st
Century,'' he told the committee.
   He said he also wanted to play a key role in developing
high-speed trains to go up to 300 mph and trains operated by
magnetic levitation.
   Carmichael said that with gridlock on some roads and in the
skies over big cities, America's railroads are the one
transportation mode with excess capacity. He said only about 25
percent of the nation's rail capacity is being used.
   Carmichael has lost Republican races in Mississippi for
governor, lieutenant governor and the U.S. Senate. He served in
1976 as a federal commissioner for the National Transportation
Policy Study Commission.
   He also was chairman of the Sunbelt Rail Commission in 1985 and
has been a member of the Mississippi Advisory Committee of the
Civil Rights Commission.
