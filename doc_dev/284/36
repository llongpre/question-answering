<HEAD>Amtrak Trial Over Sewage Dumping Begins</HEAD>

   Attorneys for Amtrak told a jury Monday
that a federal law exempts the passenger rail service from being
prosecuted for dumping sewage into public waterways from train
bridges.
   The case marks the first time Amtrak has gone to court on
criminal charges, although several Western states have criticized
its habit of flushing toilets along its right-of-way.
   Mary and William Trammel testified Monday that they were sprayed
by a dark, watery substance from an Amtrak train as they fished
below a trestle over the St. Johns River.
   Attorneys for Amtrak said the rail service never intended to
violate a Florida law that bans dumping sewage into public
waterways. But even if the law was broken, attorneys said, federal
law exempts Amtrak from prosecution.
   A 1972 federal law allows Amtrak to dispose of waste by dumping
it along its right-of-way because Congress found the company could
not comply with a federal health study prohibiting the practice,
attorney Edward Booth said.
   However, Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer told jurors that
the Florida law does count.
   The charges stem from incidents in November and December 1988
and May 1989. Bayer said Amtrak in those months allegedly dumped
human waste into the St. Johns River and Rice Creek as trains
crossed bridges.
   Amtrak is on trial on four counts of commercial littering and
one count of causing a nuisance. The littering charges are felonies
under Florida law.
   Although the statute calls for fines and jail times, the state
is merely seeking to have the practice stopped, prosecutors have
said.
   The railroad has threatened to suspend service to Florida, where
it carries about 1 million passengers a year, if the state
continues to press its case.
   Amtrak officials have said it would be too costly to put holding
tanks on its existing trains, although it hopes eventually to
replace much of its fleet with new cars that would have holding
tanks for all toilets.
   The case is expected to go to the jury Wednesday.
