   A freight engine rammed an Amtrak train
sitting at a station early today, injuring 31 people, officials
said.
   Amtrak's northbound 19-car Silver Meteor, which runs from
Florida to New York City, was about to leave with 471 passengers
when it was hit at 1:23 a.m. by the engine pulling 96 freight cars,
said Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Duricka.
   All of the injured were aboard the passenger train, said Lindsay
Leckie, a spokesman for CSX Transporation, operator of the freight
locomotive.
   ``It slammed me into the seat in front of me and then threw me
back in my seat,'' said Mary Lou Henley of Lackawana, N.Y.
   Police Capt. Larry Wells said 31 people were treated at
hospitals and were discharged to continue their journey. ``Most
complaints were of back pain, neck injury and we had a few
nosebleeds,'' Wells said.
   Wells said that by late morning the track had been cleared and
rail service had resumed through the station.
   Three passenger coaches derailed but didn't turn over, Ms.
Duricka said from Amtrak headquarters in Washington.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
   Leckie said he didn't know how fast the locomotive was going,
but one passenger said she had heard it was only mvoing at 3 mph.
   The passengers included college students returning from Florida
vacations and 22 members of a high school French club destined for
Canada from Red Springs.
   The club members from Flora McDonald Academy boarded the train
in Fayetteville, said headmistress Elma Averitte. One student
suffered whiplash but rejoined students on buses to New York, she
said.
   ``We just had a student who was terrified of train rides and we
assured her nothing would happen,'' Ms. Averitte said. ``We've got
another group leaving for London today, but they're flying.''
   ``It really wasn't that bad,'' said a 17-year-old member of the
group, who gave only his first name, Jonathan. ``The girls
freaked.''
   Leckie said there were no injuries to the three-man crew of the
switch train, a locomotive use to move freight cars around yard. He
said the cars were being taken to a siding for cleaning and
probably were empty.
   Most of the passengers boarded chartered buses en route to their
destinations or to Washington, where they could board northbound
trains, said Amtrak supervisor Sam Wilson.
