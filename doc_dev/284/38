   Slightly fewer people rode Amtrak last year,
but they helped bring about record revenues by taking longer trips
and spending more on food, the quasi-governmental corporation
reported.
   In a report for fiscal 1989, which ended Sept. 30, the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation said the number of passengers dipped
from 21.5 million to 21.4 million.
   But revenues of $1.27 billion were up from $1.1 billion a year
earlier. Passenger miles, defined as one passenger being carried
one mile, rose from 5.7 billion in 1988 to 5.9 billion, Amtrak
reported.
   That income covered 72 percent of Amtrak's costs, up from 69
percent a year earlier and the best revenue-to-cost performance in
the agency's history, it said in the report released Monday.
   The difference between revenues and costs is made up by federal
appropriations. Amtrak says its goal is to eliminate operating
subsidies from the government in the next 10 years.
   As recently as 1981, Amtrak's revenues covered less than half of
its costs.
   President Bush proposed in his first budget last year to
eliminate Amtrak subsidies, just as President Reagan had done
earlier. But Congress went ahead with funds for Amtrak, providing
$615 million for the current fiscal year, 1990.
   Amtrak said that to end the dependence on operating subsidies it
will need capital grants to expand its fleet and facilities.
   In the annual report, Amtrak said passenger-related revenue
climbed nearly 14 percent, from $766 million in fiscal 1988 to $870
million. Passenger-related revenue includes receipts from fares and
food-service sales.
   The rest of the revenue came from mail and express shipments,
real estate income and other activities.
   The average trip was for 274 miles last year, compared with 264
miles in the previous year, Amtrak said. Part of the reason for the
half-percent decline in passenger numbers was that cars had to be
taken out of service temporarily as part of a ``more aggressive
program of equipment maintenance.''
