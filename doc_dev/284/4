   Your anti-Amtrak editorial ("Chug, Chug, Chug," Feb. 28)
carefully avoided mentioning figures reflecting Amtrak's
substantial recent progress. In fiscal 1990, travel on Amtrak
rose for the eighth straight year; this was Amtrak's fifth
consecutive record year. Amtrak handled 6.06 billion
passenger-miles, up 45% from fiscal 1982 and up 21% from what
private railroads handled on a much larger network in 1970.
   Meanwhile, the revenues-to-operating-costs ratio improved
from 48% in fiscal 1981 to 72% last year partly because fares
rose almost twice as fast as the consumer price index,
reflecting strong demand for train travel.

   The Oak Ridge National Laboratory says airlines used 1.9%
times more energy per passenger-mile than did Amtrak in 1987,
up from 1.8 in 1984. Imagine how much more impressive Amtrak
would look if better track permitted 90 mph speeds in more
corridors. This should be of more than passing interest to a
nation heavily dependent on imported oil and greatly
concerned about the environmental impact of transportation.
   Yet the administration proposes to cut Amtrak and
Northeast Corridor Improvement funding by 41%, from $815
million this year to $480 million in 1992, eliminating the
possibility of improving New England trackage so Amtrak could
relieve Boston-New York air congestion to the same extent
trains already help the New York-Washington market.
   The true causes of Amtrak's subsidy needs are heavy
subsidies to other forms of transportation and outmoded
federal laws that also hurt the freight railroads and that
the privatization of Amtrak would not affect.

   Your editorial misses the whole purpose for Amtrak's
formation some 20 years ago. Congress created Amtrak as a
result of the nation's private carriers' decision to
disinvest in passenger rail service. At a time when the
nation desperately needs relief from commuter woes, your call
for privatizing our national passenger rail system is surely
a recipe for disaster.
   Amtrak's future is not about privatization, it is about
providing a public service that will become even more
critical as overcrowded transportation corridors are further
strangled by congestion and a deteriorating infrastructure.
No other nation has a subsidy-free passenger rail system,
despite the wishful claims of Amtrak's Graham Claytor, who
says the passenger railroad will be fully self-sufficient by
the end of this decade.
   Privatization would mean abandonment of service that in
many areas is vital to maintaining a viable network of
alternative sources of commuter transportation. Rebuilding a
passenger rail infrastructure after major abandonment, if not
completely impossible, would be much more costly than
maintaining the service now.
   The Bush administration's request for $500 million for
Amtrak improves on the zero-budget proposals of past years,
but is still grossly inadequate. Amtrak cannot possibly
maintain its current network, perform necessary maintenance
and make much needed capital expenditures without substantial
financial support from the federal government.

   In an April 1 letter from the National Association of
Railroad Passengers, the following sentence had an erroneous
percent sign. It should have read: "The Oak Ridge National
Laboratory says airlines used 1.9 times more energy per
passenger-mile than did Amtrak in 1987, up from 1.8 in 1984."
