Despite dirt and fumes, there's no finer vantage point than the rear 
observation platform of the last car, watching the countryside unfold to the 
rhythmic clickety-clack of steel wheels over rail joints. 
</P>
<P>
And that's where passengers gather on the stainless-steel, domed Budd car that 
brings up the rear of Amtrak's No. 11, The Coast Starlight, as it begins its 
28-hour journey down the West Coast on a sunny October afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
It is the inaugural run for the newly rebuilt Sierra Hotel, one of several 
hundred individually owned private train cars that are enjoying a renaissance, 
rising from the scrap yards to grace the rails once again with their stately 
splendor. In its heyday, the car carried passengers on the California Zephyr. 
</P>
<P>
For owner Doug Ebert, 43, a Chicago-based airline pilot, the trip fulfills a 
long-held belief this genteel mode of travel must not fade into obsolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"In college, I was a cook on the Great Northern Railroad's Empire Builder, part 
of the last generation to experience passenger-train travel as it once was," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As The Coast Starlight ambles south, the car's vista dome offers an 
unobstructed view of the Cascade Range's snow-peaked mountains, bathed in the 
glow of the setting sun. An elegant dinner is served on white linen 
tablecloths, with heavy flatware. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the reason I've gone through all this," says Ebert, smiling as he sips 
a Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
A dense early-morning fog shrouds the fields as the train rolls into the 
Sacramento station. Night has passed quickly. The Sierra Hotel's passengers, 
lulled to sleep hours before by the train's motion, begin to stir in the 
comfortable berths of their tiny private bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
California's changing scenery provides the day's entertainment, while the train 
wends through fertile valleys. By mid-afternoon, the tracks leave the parched 
hills to hug the Pacific Ocean near San Luis Obispo. At last, the skyline of 
downtown Los Angeles appears. 
</P>
<P>
There the Sierra Hotel and a caravan of cars from around the country are 
readied for the trip to San Diego, site of the 12th annual convention of the 
American Assn. of Private Railroad Car Owners. 
</P>
<P>
The association, about a third of its 540 members actively running cars, was 
formed in 1977 to provide a mechanism for working with Amtrak. Private cars pay 
Amtrak about $2 million a year in mileage, switching and parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are highly dependent on Amtrak for movement, and must respond to its 
equipment standards," says membership chairman Larry Haines. Most private cars 
run almost exclusively on Amtrak trains, but a few occasionally operate on 
freight and private lines. 
</P>
<P>
An empty San Diego train yard has suddenly become a museum of beautifully 
restored private cars, as crews hose the dust off the cars' sides and polish 
their brass rails. Formerly the exclusive domain of Presidents, railroad 
executives and the very wealthy, private cars, or "private varnishes," have 
gone mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Today's owners, bound by a passion for railroads and a commitment to preserving 
this link with the past, often borrow heavily to finance their dreams. Many 
have the ability to do much of the restoration and maintenance themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few reserve their cars for private use, most owners occasionally 
charter them to help offset their investment ($125,000 and up for a car that 
qualifies to run on Amtrak). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anyone who makes a profit," says Haines. "Some, if they have the 
time to devote to it, operate intensively and will claim to break even." 
Chartering fees range from $1,000 to $3,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
As twilight falls over San Diego, lanterns suspended from dozens of observation 
platforms cast a welcome glow throughout the train yard. Fold-down steps usher 
visitors from car to car, while well-dressed owners and crew proffer drinks and 
hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
If any car there retains the spirit of its previous owners, it is the Virginia 
City, whose ramblings were chronicled by the late bon vivant journalist Lucius 
Beebe three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Decorated by a Hollywood set designer in the mid-1950s, it epitomizes baroque 
opulence, with crystal chandeliers, gold-leaf trim, and imported Venetian 
Renaissance furniture.

rails, says he will keep on working until "the Lord calls me home." A retired 
Pullman porter who has served the famous, Newman is much sought after as a crew 
member aboard restored private train cars. ; Photo, Dinner is served on linen
