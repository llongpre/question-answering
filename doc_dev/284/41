President Bush on Thursday vetoed a bill authorizing $2 billion in spending by 
Amtrak, complaining that the bill's expansion of federal regulation over 
railroad acquisitions "represents a step backward for the entire rail 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Bush took issue with a provision that would require the Interstate Commerce 
Commission to approve the acquisition of railroads by non-railroad companies. 
</P>
<P>
"This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the financial 
restructuring of the railroad industry," Bush told Congress in a veto message. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said the veto would have no effect on daily 
train operations because the national rail passenger service is working with 
money that Congress already had appropriated for 1989-1992. 
</P>
<P>
But the veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter line between 
Washington and its Northern Virginia suburbs, Black said. The bill contained 
technical provisions necessary for the project to open. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He returned 10 bills to Congress in his first 
year in office. None has been overridden. 
</P>
<P>
The vetoed legislation would have authorized a new, three-year government 
subsidy of $2 billion to Amtrak. Actual spending levels are set by separate 
appropriations bills. 
</P>
<P>
Black said Amtrak supports the provision that prompted Bush's veto, although it 
applies only to private freight railroads. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Amtrak relies on private freight lines for its tracks 
outside the Northeast corridor and "does support ICC oversight of takeovers of 
railroads by non-railroad companies."
