   Failed brakes may have caused an Amtrak train to
derail and smash into a commuter train, injuring 264 people,
federal safety officials said.
   They also said Thursday that the Amtrak train may have been
traveling too fast along a curve where the crash occurred, but that
the speed may never be determined because one speed recorder on the
train was not working and the other was destroyed in the crash.
   An apprentice engineer operating the Amtrak train told
investigators he tried to brake three times as the Night Owl from
Washington approached a Boston station, said Susan Coughlin, vice
chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   ``He indicated that in his three attempts to brake the train,
the brakes failed to set up properly to stop it,'' Coughlin said at
a news conference.
   The apprentice, Richard Abramson, also told authorities that
senior engineer Willis Copeland tried to stop the Night Owl using
emergency brakes, she said.
   Coughlin said brakes on Amtrak cars that did not derail were
working normally. Brakes from the derailed cars were sent to
Washington for testing.
   The rush-hour crash Wednesday morning near the Back Bay Station
injured 264 people. Copeland, 53, of Bethany, Conn., and Abramson,
41, of Trumbull, Conn., were among 11 of those Thursday still
hospitalized.
   Coughlin said that one of the Night Owl's speed recorders was
destroyed in the crash and the other, for unknown reasons, did not
record during the last five miles.
   ``We will never know the exact speed of impact. I regret the
fact that we don't have'' that data, she said. ``The last time he
(Abramson) looked at the speedometer, he was going between 60 and
70 mph,'' she said.
   Coughlin said data from signals tripped by the train showed it
traveled the last 1\ miles in 49 seconds at an average speed of
91.8 mph. Before that last stretch, the train could travel safely
at 100 mph. But it should have slowed down to 30 mph by the time it
reached the point where it derailed, on a curve 500 feet from the
station, she said.
   It was the first time Copeland had taken over operation of a
regular train run, authorities said.
   The Herald and The Boston Globe said drug and alcohol tests on
Copeland were negative. The results of those on Abramson were
awaited.
   The force of the crash bent the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority's 120-ton locomotive around a concrete barrier in an
L-shape. Three Amtrak cars, including the locomotive that carried
the two Amtrak engineers, became a mesh of broken metal parts,
barely distinguishable as separate units.
   Thomas Glynn, MBTA general manager, said the accident caused
$3.1 million in damage to MBTA equipment and ``extensive'' damage
to Amtrak equipment.
   The Herald reported today that Copeland was fired from Conrail
after a derailment in the late 1970s but was later rehired. More
recently, the paper said, he agreed to a lifetime ban from
Metro-North Railroad, the commuter railroad that serves New York's
northern suburbs, following signal violations in 1988 and last
year.
   He also was at the controls of an Amtrak train involved in a
July 1984 crash that was blamed on a signal problem. The National
Transportation safety Board cleared him of wrongdoing.
   John P. Cole, a Washington lawyer representing crash victims,
said he planned to file a $475 million class action suit in U.S.
District Court in Washington against Amtrak because of the
accident.
