   Amtrak said it is seeking to acquire 49 miles of track from closely held Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., and would restore Montreal-Washington train service next year. 

   The Amtrak Montrealer discontinued operation north of Springfield, Mass., last April because of conditions restricting trains to 5-10 mph on much of Guilford's track between Brattleboro and Windsor, Vt. 

   Negotiations to get Guilford, based in North Billerica, Mass., to repair the track were "unproductive," Amtrak said. 
If Guilford declines to accept a cash proposal for the line, Amtrak said, the Washington-based passenger railroad will file a condemnation request with the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
Amtrak declined to specify the purchase proposal it will make to Guilford. 

   Amtrak said it has an agreement to then sell the line to Central Vermont Railway Inc., a St. Albans, Vt., unit of Canadian National Railway Co. Amtrak would invest as much as $5 million to renovate the track. 
Central Vermont currently operates some freight trains on the Guilford line through a track rights agreement. 

   Guilford officials declined to comment. 
The regional railroad, which is continuing to operate despite a strike by unionized employees, has said it doesn't have any plans to sell the line.
