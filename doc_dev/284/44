   Amtrak has begun installing smoke detectors
in crew cars as a result of a weekend fire that killed an employee,
a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   The installation of smoke detectors began Monday in the 15 or so
double-decker cars that serve as crew sleeping quarters on
long-distance trips, Debbie Marciniak said in a telephone interview
from Chicago.
   The move came after a 70-year-old Amtrak employee died of smoke
inhalation from a fire that began early Saturday in the crew car of
a westbound California Zephyr. Nineteen people suffered minor
injuries.
   The fire was discovered as the train pulled into Hastings, about
150 miles west of here, for a scheduled stop.
   Some passengers complained that they were not warned about the
fire, and questioned why there were no smoke detectors on the train.
   Marciniak said the train crew's first priority was to rescue
those in the employee car and evacuate those in a passenger sleeper.
   Amtrak officials said the passengers were in no danger because
the burning crew car and the passenger sleeper were detached from
the coach section of the train.
   Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen had said commercial smoke
detectors were too sensitive and that the vibration of the trains
would set them off. He said train fires were rare, but that Amtrak
had been looking for a reliable smoke detector.
   Marciniak said Wednesday that the newly installed smoke
detectors may go off as a result of cigarette smoke or dust, but
that the false alarms would be preferable to not having any alarms.
   The railroad also is considering installing smoke detectors in
passenger sleepers, she said.
   Amtrak has been trying to develop a fire and smoke alarm system
for several years, and during the last six months has asked vendors
for assistance, Marciniak said.
   Four companies appear to have a concept that may work and Amtrak
is working with them, she said.
   The state fire marshal's office has blamed the fire on an
electrical short in the crew car.
   Marciniak said Amtrak officials believe the fire may have begun
when boxes of pillows placed next to a heating element in the
luggage storage compartment of the crew car ignited. However,
Amtrak officials are continuing to investigate, she said.
   In the meantime, Marciniak said Amtrak had disconnected all
heating elements in the luggage storage compartments in similar
crew cars. In addition, emergency windows in the dormitory section
of the cars are being expanded, she said.
