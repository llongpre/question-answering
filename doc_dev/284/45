   Amtrak train No. 392 left Carbondale at
mid-afternoon as usual, but when it pulled into Chicago's Union
Station about seven hours later, five people were dead after two
collisions with the locomotive, authorities said Tuesday.
   A young Southern Illinois couple and two of their children died
Monday when their car turned off a parallel road near Effingham and
crossed the track in front of the train about 90 minutes into its
run, police and Amtrak officials said.
   About 3{ hours later, a 20-year-old woman was killed when her
car skirted horizontal crossing gates and struck the train near
Kankakee, about 60 miles south of Chicago, officials said.
   ``You don't forget things like this. ... You get the shakes,''
said engineer T.B. Parker, who was operating the train when the
second crash occurred.
   None of the train's more than 50 passengers was injured, said
Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Marciniak.
   She said the two train drivers were not responsible for the
deaths. ``They were powerless to avoid the accidents, and no
disciplinary action is planned,'' she said.
   Ms. Marciniak said the Federal Railroad Administration had
contacted Amtrak operations personnel Tuesday about the accidents.
Bill Loftus, a spokesman for the agency in Washington, said he was
unaware of any investigation but that his agency might have called
to make sure no federal railroad laws had been violated.
   The victims of the first accident were identified as Cecil Ray
Chandler, 26, of La Clede; his wife, Brenda, 25; their 4-year-old
daughter, Kerry, and 3-year-old son, Carl, said state Police Sgt.
Don Boldrey.
   Parker said fireman William White, 55, was driving when the run
began. They both saw the Chandler car turn off a parallel road and
head slowly toward the track.
   Parker said he did not believe the family saw the train at the
crossing, marked with a crossing symbol but no gate or lights.
   ``I could see the female occupant of the car, and she never
looked at us. ... I thought I saw the woman holding a child.
   ``Mr. White had already applied the brakes,'' Parker said. ``He
started blowing the whistle. Then we put the brakes in emergency,
but it was too late.''
   He said the engine had been traveling about 76 mph and came to a
halt one-third of a mile down the track. Ms. Marciniak said she did
not know what the authorized speed limit was in that area but said
the train was traveling within it.
   ``There was nothing the guy could have done to stop it,'' Ms.
Marciniak said of the train's driver. She said the car exploded on
impact.
   Chandler, an unemployed saw-mill worker, and his wife had three
other children, said Ronald Pagel, owner of Pagel Funeral Home in
Edgewood.
   The train was delayed about an hour and then headed north again,
with Parker taking the controls about halfway through the 300 mile
run _ a routine switch.
   The train passed through Kankakee after dark at the maximum 79
mph when the railway men saw a car approach rapidly from the west,
Parker said.
   ``The crossing signals were working, the gates were down, and we
were blowing the whistle,'' he said.
   But the car moved into the left lane as if to bypass the gates,
Parker said. The vehicle struck the train's front wheels, causing
what he described as ``a minor jolt'' that destroyed the compact
car.
   Annette Hanshew, who lived outside Bourbonnais, died in the
crash, said Deputy Kankakee County Coroner Robert Gessner.
   Last year, Illinois ranked second in the nation with 481
accidents at rail crossings, Ms. Marciniak said, behind Texas with
625.
