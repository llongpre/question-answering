   Amtrak goes to trial on criminal charges
Monday for allegedly dumping raw sewage into Florida waterways in a
case that pits state law against federal law and ecology against
economy.
   Amtrak, which has been dumping along its rights of way under a
federal law dating back more than a century, has come under fire in
several Western states as well as Florida for its sanitary habits.
The case is the first of those disputes to go before a judge on
criminal charges.
   Amtrak is charged with four counts of commercial littering and
one count of creating or allowing a nuisance to health. The
nuisance charge alleges that Amtrak dumped sewage on fishermen in a
boat under a rail trestle on May 18.
   The state charges were filed after Amtrak refused to stop
dumping raw wastes on the tracks and into the St. Johns River and
Rice Creek.
   Although the statute calls for fines and jail times, the state
is merely seeking to have the practice stopped, said Assistant
State Attorney Dennis Bayer, who is prosecuting the case.
   The railroad has threatened to suspend service to Florida, where
it serves about 1 million passengers a year, if the state continues
to press its case.
   It would set a dangerous precedent, Amtrak says, if the railroad
bowed to state law and stopped dumping sewage from its moving
trains. Federal law permits the railway to dump its sewage on its
right-of-way, and this overrides state and local regulations,
Amtrak contends.
   The railroad went into federal court in Jacksonville to halt
prosecution of the railroad on state charges, but Circuit Judge
Robert Perry refused to delay the trial pending a ruling on the
federal case.
   Amtrak, which operates 12 trains daily in and out of Florida,
may be exempt from regulatory actions but cannot dodge criminal
charges, Bayer said.
