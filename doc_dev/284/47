   A freight train partially derailed today,
blocking rails and interrupting both north- and southbound Amtrak
passenger service along the East Coast, authorities said.
   Eleven cars of a southbound, 96-car Richmond, Fredericksburg and
Potomac Co. freight train slipped off the tracks about eight miles
north of this rural northern Virginia town, a spokesman for the
railroad said today.
   ``There are no hazardous materials in any of those cars and no
one was hurt,'' RF&amp;P Director of Labor Relations William E. Griffin
said.
   The cause of the derailment wasn't immediately known, he said.
   Several freight cars toppled, damaging both the north- and
southbound rail lines, Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said.
   The accident about 6 a.m. halted the Amtrak Silver Meteor, bound
from Miami and Tampa, Fla., to New York.
   ``Passengers are being off-loaded onto buses, which will take
them to Washington,'' Black said. About 300 New York-bound
passengers were to pick up other trains in Washington, he said.
   Two Amtrak trains originating in Richmond were canceled, and
passengers were bused to Washington, Black said.
   The freight the train was carrying included paper and ground
limestone, officials said.
