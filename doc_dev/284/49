   President Bush today vetoed a bill authorizing
funds for Amtrak, the nation's rail passenger service, protesting a
provision to bring railroad acquisitions under new government
scrutiny.
   Bush said the provision ``represents a step backward for the
entire rail industry.''
   It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He voted 10 measures last year
and has yet to have one overturned.
   An Amtrak spokesman, Clifford Black, said the veto would have no
effect on daily train operations because the railroad is working
from money that Congress already appropriated for 1989-1992.
   But the veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter
line being developed between Washington and its Northern Virginia
suburbs, Black said. The bill contained technical provisions that
were needed for the project to open.
   The bill also contained provisions that would have saved Amtrak
$16 million over two years in unemployment insurance payments for
railroad workers, Black said.
   ``We vigorously support an override of this veto,'' Black said.
   The provision that prompted the veto does not affect Amtrak
because it applies only to private freight rails, he added.
   In a veto message to Congress, Bush criticized a provision that
would require the government to review and approve proposed
acquisitions of railroads by non-railroad companies and
organizations.
   ``This new regulatory burden would interfere with the ability of
the nation's largest freight railroads to obtain needed capital or
to change existing capital structure,'' Bush said.
   He said that it would even subject to new scrutiny attempts to
take over a rail line by ``a carrier's own management or
employees.''
   ``This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to
financial restructuring of the railroad industry,'' Bush said.
   He said there is also adequate protection under existing law
``to protect the public interest in acquisition situations.''
   The provision would require Interstate Commerce Commission
approval of all railroad takeovers by non-railroad companies.
   The vetoed legislation, sent to Bush May 10, authorized the
government subsidy of Amtrak.
   It envisions more than $2 billion in federal money going to the
railroad over the three-year period between last Oct. 1 and Sept.
30, 1992. The actual amount would be determined as part of
Congress' annual appropriations process.
   Bush administration officials also complained that the bill
amounted to a government subsidy that amounts to about $29 a
passenger. However, the cost of the measure was not cited by Bush
in his veto message.
