   Investigators were trying to
determine Monday what caused an 18-car passenger train to jump the
tracks, stranding nearly 300 holiday travelers overnight but
injuring no one, Amtrak said Monday.
   The passengers aboard the California Zephyr remained on the
train, which still had light and heat, for several hours until a
work train Monday brought them here in two trips aboard seven
cabooses.
   ``We know what happened, not why it happened,'' said John
Jacobsen, Amtrak director of public relations in Washington, D.C.
   Jacobsen said some of the wheels slipped between the rails,
causing the cars to go off the tracks.
   ``The wheels dropped down between the rails and that's what kept
it upright,'' he said. ``The train couldn't move because it was
locked into place by the rail.''
   But, he emphasized, ``I don't know whether there was a problem
with the rail,'' and added that any number of things could have
caused the accident.
   ``That's all under investigation,'' he said.
   Rick Davis, Amtrak liaison for the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad,
which maintains the track, said it was premature to say what caused
the derailment.
   Jerry Pilcher of Chicago said passengers took the derailment in
stride, in part because the train already was several hours behind
schedule. ``There was a bit of caroling. It couldn't have gone more
smoothly if it had been a drill,'' said Pilcher.
   The train, carrying 294 passengers and about 15 crew members,
originated in Chicago and was headed for the West Coast. It was 150
miles west of Denver and 10 miles east of here when it left the
tracks Sunday night.
   It was snowing heavily at the time and about a foot of snow was
on the ground, but that shouldn't have had any bearing on the track,
Jacobsen said.
   Some passengers compared the derailment to a rough airplane
landing or driving over cobblestones.
   ``It was a miracle no one got hurt,'' said Wardell Copeland of
Vallejo, Calif. ``It was amazing that none of the cars went off into
the (Colorado) river. About 15 feet and that would have been it.''
   ``I was asleep and all at once ... I thought we were going over a
bridge,'' said Carolyn Johnson of Lincoln Neb. ``It just got real
rough and the train stopped.''
   Up to 40 Denver &amp; Rio Grande maintenance crew members worked on
the grounded train Monday trying to get it back on the track but
said it could take until Tuesday. The railroad maintains the track
on which the Zephyr was traveling.
   Most passengers took buses to Salt Lake City or back to Denver.
   Jacobsen said the damage to the train was probably minor.
   An Amtrak derailment in Colorado in 1985 sent 26 people to the
hospital. Seven cars left the track in a canyon near Granby,
northwest of Denver.
