   A fire in the locomotive of an Amtrak
passenger train Sunday forced the evacuation of its passengers and
blocked the New York-Washington rail corridor for four hours, an
Amtrak official said.
   The 172 passengers aboard an Amtrak Metroliner, Train 123, were
evacuated to a rear car about 8:10 p.m. with no injuries, said
Amtrak spokeswoman Marci Larson.
   Trains in both directions were backed up because power to the
overhead electrical line that powers many trains on the heavily
traveled corridor was cut to enable firefighters to battle the
blaze, Ms. Larson said.
   With the fire still burning shortly after 11 p.m., power was
restored briefly and about 10 trains that were backed up were
allowed to move through, said Capt. Frank Stokes.
   The tracks were closed again after midnight Sunday and were
reopened more than an hour later, officials said. Firefighters
remained at the scene at 2 a.m. Monday to clean up and to
investigate the cause of the blaze, the Anne Arundel Fire
Department said.
   Morning traffic was expected to run normally today, Amtrak
spokeswoman Debbie Marciniak said.
   Ms. Larson said she did not know how many passengers were
affected by the backup. The evacuated passengers were taken by bus
to Washington.
   Smoke was spotted coming from the engine of the Metroliner about
7:40 p.m., 17 miles south of Baltimore, and the train was stopped
near Grove, the Amtrak spokeswoman said. The train left New York at
5 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Washington at 7:55 p.m.
