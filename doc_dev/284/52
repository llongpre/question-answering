   Thirteen passengers and an Amtrak employee
remained hospitalized Saturday after a 12-car train derailment that
was blamed on tracks warped by near-100-degree heat.
   The train, en route from Chicago to Seattle, was traveling at 79
mph when it derailed Friday, toppling at least five of nine
passenger cars and throwing passengers from their seats, leaving
165 injured, authorities said.
   Hospitals treated and released 149 passengers, said Sue Martin,
an Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
   The train was carrying about 375 passengers and a crew of 10 to
15, Amtrak officials said.
   The engineer said the derailment was caused by deformed rails
near this northern Montana farming community.
   A secondary track near the derailment site was cleared late
Friday, allowing rail traffic to go through, Martin said. Crews
planned to spend the weekend repairing the twisted track.
   Amtrak made arrangements Saturday to get passengers to their
destinations.
   About 85 passengers left nearby Glasgow, Mont., on a bus for
Spokane, Wash., and other passengers planned to fly to their
destinations, Martin said.
   ``It's sort of a difficult situation because the airport at
Glasgow is not a commercial airport,'' she said. ``It's an old
Stragetic Air Command facility that's normally used for test
flights. So it's a matter of getting things prepared for flights in
and out of there. We've been working throughout the night with a
charter company and airport officials to find out exactly what kind
of aircraft we can use out of there.''
   Some passengers decided to remain in Glasgow and take a
westbound train Saturday, Martin said.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and
Burlington Northern Railroad, which owns the track, were due
Saturday, Martin said.
   Assistant conductor Dennis Cotton said the cars hardest hit by
the derailment were the dining car, the dorm and sleeper coaches.
   ``The first thing that happened was a brief jerk, a slowdown and
people in the aisles went sailing by,'' said Jim Matuska, a
passenger from Girard, Ill. ``The car was beginning to tilt. I was
pretty sure we were going to go down but I didn't have the presence
of mind to do anything. I was out of control. I went flying in the
opposite direction.''
