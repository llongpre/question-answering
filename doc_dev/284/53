   The senior engineer aboard an Amtrak train that
smashed into a commuter train, injuring 264 people, had been banned
from operating trains in suburban New York because of signals
violations, authorities said Friday.
   Willis Copeland, 53, of Bethany, Conn., was supervising an
apprentice engineer at the controls of the Night Owl from
Washington that derailed and crashed as it approached a Boston
station during morning rush-hour Wednesday.
   On March 27, Copeland agreed to a lifetime ban from Metro-North
Railroad, the commuter railroad that serves New York's northern
suburbs, after running two temporary stop signs in 1988 and in
March, said Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders.
   He also was at the controls of an Amtrak train involved in a
July 1984 crash that was blamed on a signal problem. The National
Transportation Safety Board cleared him of wrongdoing.
   Apprentice engineer Richard Abramson, 41, of Trumbull, Conn.,
and Copeland were among eight people still hospitalized Friday.
Copeland was in stable condition after undergoing surgery for
multiple injuries, including a spinal fracture, and Abramson was in
good condition with a broken collarbone.
   NTSB vice chairwoman Susan Coughlin said a train driven by
Copeland derailed when he failed to stop before a drawbridge in New
York state in February 1979. Two months later, Copeland was
involved in a yard derailment, she said.
   Copeland was dismissed from Conrail in December 1971 and
reinstated six weeks later, Coughlin said. The reason for the
dismissal was unclear, she said.
   Copeland was unable to comment because of his condition.
   None of the signal violations while he worked for Metro-North
resulted in an accident.
   Federal safety officials said Friday that although Abramson
reported that brake failure caused the train to derail underground
near the Back Bay Station, the investigation into the cause of the
crash is far from complete.
   ``That is what he told our investigators,'' said NTSB spokesman
Brent Bahler. ``However, that has not been confirmed through any
other interviews or information we have. The investigation is still
very much open.''
   The Night Owl derailed along a curve and crashed into a
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority commuter train, injuring
264 people.
   Abramson told investigators he tried to brake the train three
times as it approached the station.
   ``He indicated that in his three attempts to brake the train,
the brakes failed to set up properly to stop it,'' Coughlin said
Thursday night.
   NTSB officials said Friday night it was possible the brakes on
both Amtrak locomotives failed, but the brakes on the train's
passenger cars were found to be working normally.
   Coughlin also said technicians were able to recover data from an
Amtrak recorder that had been erased. That information will be
analyzed in the next few days, she said.
   A tone had been recorded over portions of the tape covering the
final minutes before the crash, but Coughlin said it was unclear
whether that was an accident or had been done intentionally.
   Abramson had taken over operation of a regular train run for the
first time this week, authorities said.
   Bahler said that each car in a train has brakes, and normally
all are used to stop a train. Preliminary tests on the
least-damaged Amtrak cars, toward the rear of the train, showed no
brake failure.
   ``However, we'll be interested in determining the condition of
the brakes on the front of the train,'' Bahler said.
   Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said train brakes are tested and
visually inspected upon departure and at every stop along a route.
   ``This train had no problems with earlier stops or speed
restrictions along the route, indicating that the brakes were
working,'' Black said, adding that it was as yet unknown whether
the brakes simply failed while entering Boston.
   ``It is within the realm of possibility that a brake problem
could have occurred at that point, but I don't know and I'm not
going to pretend to speculate,'' Black said.
   Coughlin said speed could have been a factor. Although there was
no way to determine the train's exact speed when it derailed, data
compiled from the station showed it averaged 91.8 mph during the
last 1\ miles before impact.
