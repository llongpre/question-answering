   A passenger train crashed into a truck,
injuring 30 people Thursday, less than 24 hours after another
Amtrak train smashed into a row of freight cars in Indiana in an
accident that injured 26.
   The latest accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. when the train,
``City of New Orleans,'' en route from Chicago to New Orleans,
struck a log truck at a private railroad crossing near the Memphis
Hardwood Co., a lumberyard in Durant.
   Authorities said no flashing lights or signs marked the crossing.
   ``It looked like a dynamite explosion,'' said state Trooper
Jimmie D. Thomas, who witnessed the accident. ``When it hit, it
scattered lumber all over creation, and the truck was dragged down
the track.''
   ``It was a big jolt,'' said passenger Melissa Mitchell.
``Everybody woke up. ... We got outside and saw that we were
majorly off the track, but upright.''
   Deborah Hare, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said there were 200
passengers and 13 crew members aboard the train. Four crew members
were among those injured, she said. Officials earlier said there
were from 160 to 170 people, including crew, on the train.
   It was the second Amtrak crash in two days and the third in two
weeks.
   Authorities said an incorrectly set switch sent a
Chicago-to-Indianapolis train crashing into freight cars Wednesday
night near Crawfordsville, Ind. On April 22, at least 91 people
were reported hurt, three seriously, when the national passenger
rail line's California Zephyr derailed in Iowa en route from
California to Chicago.
   The southbound ``Hoosier State'' with 30 to 35 people aboard
derailed Wednesday night after striking five freight cars parked on
an outside track 40 miles northwest of Indianapolis.
   A passenger and the train's engineer and assistant engineer
remained hospitalized Thursday with minor injuries. The others were
treated.
   ``Thank God we were only going 25 (mph), or him and I would be
history,'' said assistant engineer James Neff, 42, referring to
himself and Amtrak employee James Ullery, 40.
   Ullery said that by the time he noticed the train was on the
wrong track, it was too late.
   Officials from Amtrak, Conrail, the National Transportation
Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration were
investigating the cause of the crash, but released no preliminary
results. Conrail owns the track where the accident occurred.
   In the accident at Durant, District Two Community Hospital
reported at least 30 people were brought from the scene. A
spokeswoman said that except for the truck driver, most of the
people were treated for bumps and bruises.
   The truck driver, Andrew Wilbur Boren, 69, an employee of
Memphis Hardwood, was transferred by helicopter to Mississippi
Baptist Medical Center in Jackson, 45 miles south of Durant. He was
in stable condition.
   ``I was sound asleep when the train hit, and it was a rather
rude and abrupt alarm clock I thought,'' Mitchell said.
   Boren was trapped more than one hours after the accident. The
log truck had left a nearby lumberyard shortly before the crash
occurred.
   Amtrak officials said the remaining passengers were loaded on
school buses and driven to Jackson where they would catch chartered
buses to New Orleans.
   State Trooper L.C. Clark said three engines ran off the tracks
and were lying on their sides next to the rails. Three passenger
cars also derailed but remained upright.
