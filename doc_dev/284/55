   A 19-car Amtrak passenger train derailed
Monday, injuring at least 83 of the 400 people aboard, authorities
said.
   Seven cars of the eastbound California Zephyr derailed about
1:25 p.m. on Burlington Northern tracks, authorities said.
Eyewitnesses counted as many as nine cars off the track.
   ``It made a hell of a noise and then all kind of dust started
flying,'' said Robert Franklin of Batavia.
   ``It was just one big, loud bang. Kind of like a clankety,
clang,'' said his wife, Patricia.
   The train was carrying 394 passengers and about 20 crew members,
said Debbie Hare, an Amtrak spokeswoman in Chicago.
   Area hospitals reported receiving at least 83 people from the
accident, 10 of whom were hurt seriously enough to be admitted.
   Iowa State Patrol Lt. Ronald Moon said there were no known
deaths.
   The cars began to run off the track just before it reached a
crossing on the southern edge of this town of 525 residents, 90
miles southeast of Des Moines.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and
Burlington Northern were dispatched to the scene.
   The train had 12 passenger cars, four baggage cars and three
locomotives, said Sue Martin, an Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington.
   Marci Larson, another Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington, said the
last seven cars derailed: three remained upright, three were left
leaning and one, a sleeper car, was turned on its side.
   Amtrak officials said they did not know how fast the train was
traveling when the cars left the tracks and that the train's
``black box'' would have to be examined. The train is authorized to
travel as fast as 79 mph in the area, they said.
   Among the passengers was Wisconsin State Rep. Marlin Schneider,
who was returning from the National Conference of State
Legislatures in Boise, Idaho, and suffered a bruise to his leg.
   ``We were having lunch and suddenly the train came apart,'' said
Schneider, who was traveling with his two young daughters.
   ``It started to buckle. Cars are off the tracks everywhere. ...
We didn't get hurt very badly but a number of people did.''
   Schneider said it was fortunate he and his daughters were in the
dining car and not in their sleeping car, which tipped over.
   Uninjured passengers were taken to a community center about two
blocks away from the crash.
   ``The train just started shaking,'' Jasonna Gibson of
Schenectady, N.Y. said. She said she was holding her baby, Tamu,
when the train derailed.
   ``The baby fell. I tried to get him and a lady fell on me,'' Ms.
Gibson said.
   Paula Stater, whose lives about a quarter mile from where the
train derailed, said she saw it topple from the tracks.
   ``It just went over,'' she said. ``It just made a sound, like
metal grating metal. It was really unusual, like a bunch of wheels
hitting.''
   Paul Tray, 29, of Batavia, said workers were using a ladder to
climb down into the tipped-over cars, searching for people who
might be in the wreckage.
   Ms. Martin said the train had been running two hours late
because the Oakland section had to detour between Oakland and
Sacrameto due to a gasoline spill on or near the tracks.
   Amtrak was busing passengers to Chicago to continue their trip.
   Sections of the California Zephyr originate in Seattle, Los
Angeles and Oakland, Calif., and are linked in Salt Lake City for
the trip to Chicago, Hare said.
   On Oct. 12, 1987, two locomotives and 11 of 14 passenger cars of
the California Zephyr collided with maintenance equipment on a side
track near the town of Russell, injuring 122 people. That crash was
55 miles west of Monday's derailment.
   Also Monday, crews in western Pennsylvania skimmed crude oil
from the surface of a creek that was fouled when a freight train
derailed and caught fire. Twenty-nine cars in a 97-car Buffalo and
Pittsburgh Railroad Inc. train derailed in Craigsville, Pa., on
Sunday night. No serious injuries were reported in the ensuing
explosion and fire.
