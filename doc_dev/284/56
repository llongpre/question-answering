   A water quality expert testified
Wednesday that Amtrak's practice of dumping raw human waste from
its trains has no significant impact on water quality in the St.
Johns River and Rice Creek.
   Dr. Robert Harris, a consultant hired by Amtrak, testified in
the third day of a hearing before U.S. District Judge Howell Melton
on whether the state can prosecute the national passenger rail
service for dumping raw sewage in Florida.
   Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer, who prosecuted the
railroad in Putnam County for commercial littering, said the
hearing, originally scheduled to end Wednesday, probably would
continue through Friday.
   Harris estimated the amount of waste dumped by Amtrak trains
crossing bridges over the river and creek and determined ``there
was no significant impact on water quality.''
   He estimated that the amount of waste dumped into the waterways
by the railroad was the equivalent of the daily discharge of one
person for a day.
   If anything, Harris said, his assumptions overestimated the
amount of waste dumped from Amtrak trains.
   Last December, Amtrak was convicted by a jury in Palatka on four
state felony charges of disposing of wastes into the two streams.
   Amtrak could face up to $20,000 in fines if the federal judge
determines that the railroad is bound by state pollution laws,
rather than federal laws that allow it to dump. Sentencing for the
state conviction was delayed pending Judge Melton's decision.
   Fishermen had complained that they were sprayed with sewage
while fishing under rail trestles as Amtrak trains passed overhead.
   Amtrak conductor Carl E. Harris testified Wednesday that
passengers are now asked not to flush train toilets when passing
over waterways near Palatka.
   Amtrak officials have said they would have to suspend service to
Florida if train toilets cannot be flushed onto the roadbed.
