   Crews today rescued nearly 300
holiday passengers stranded after their 18-car Amtrak train derailed
in a rugged canyon during a snowstorm, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported among the 294 passengers and
approximately 15 crew members Christmas night when the California
Zephyr went off the tracks in Glenwood Canyon, about 10 miles east
of here and 150 miles west of Denver.
   ``I felt something shift. The train was going 30 miles per
hour,'' said passenger Mike Mettert of Greenwood, Ind. ``The train
stopped and squealed. We felt a few bumps, and there we were.''
   A work train pulling seven cabooses brought the passengers and
crew to Glenwood Springs, where they were put in hotels, said John
Jacobsen, Amtrak's director of public affairs.
   ``Some of them were just glad to be here. Others were angry and
they felt like Amtrak should compensate them,'' said Janet Muttillo,
night auditor at the Hotel Denver in Glenwood Springs.
   The 15 cars and two locomotives on the Amtrak train landed
upright next to the tracks in the canyon, which rises above the
Colorado River, Jacobsen said from his Washington, D.C., home today.
A third locomotive remained on the tracks.
   The derailment was caused by a warped track, Jacobsen said.
   ``The rail spread apart enough to cause the wheels to drop into a
ridge between the rails,'' he said. ``The wheels dropped down
between the rails and that's what kept it upright. The train
couldn't move because it was locked into place by the rail.''
   ``We know what happened, not why it happened,'' he said.
   It was ``snowing like the dickens'' at the time of the accident,
a sheriff's dispatcher said, and there was about a foot of snow at
the derailment site.
   Until they were evacuated, passengers remained on the train,
which briefly lost its heat and light, said Glenwood Springs Police
Sgt. Terry Gallant.
   ``It's still coupled together and upright. I imagine they'll have
it back on the track before the day's out,'' Jacobsen said. ``I have
no doubt there is some damage to it. Any time you take a turn and
get it off the rail, there's some damage to the wheels. I suspect
the damage will be very minor.''
   One passenger, an unidentified 63-year-old California woman, was
taken to Valley View Hospital as a precaution, but was released
after it was determined she was in good condition, nursing
supervisor Carol Davis said.
   The derailment occurred just after 9 p.m. The train's most recent
stop was Denver and its next stop was to be Salt Lake City. From
there, it would have split, carrying passengers to Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Seattle.
   Traffic moved through the canyon on a parallel track, said Tony
Marzano, chief transportation officer with the Denver and Rio Grande
Railroad, on which the train was traveling.
