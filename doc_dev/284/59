   The House voted 294-123 today to override
President Bush's veto of a bill authorizing $2 billion for Amtrak
and increasing government power over freight railroad acquisitions.
   The override measure went to the Senate, where the vote was
expected to be closer. A two-thirds vote of both houses is required
to turn back a presidential veto. Congress has failed to override
all 10 previous Bush vetoes.
   Bush has said he would support Amtrak funding, unlike former
President Reagan, but objected to increased power to be given the
Interstate Commerce Commission, calling it ``a step backward for the
entire rail industry.''
   Democrats argued that the ICC already has power over sale of a
portion of a railroad or sale of more than one railroad to investors
outside the industry but has decided it cannot scrutinize sale of a
whole railroad.
   House GOP Leader Bob Michel of Illinois introduced a bill today
before the veto vote that contained all of the provisions of the
Amtrak legislation except for the ICC section.
   ``The president is committed to an adequate passenger rail
service,'' Michel told the House, adding that Bush would not veto
the new measure.
   The veto has had affected daily train operations because the
railroad is working with money that Congress already had
appropriated. The bill envisions more than $2 billion going to
Amtrak through Sept. 30, 1992. Actual amounts will be determined
when Congress appropriates the money.
   The veto had threatened plans for a commuter line between
Washington, D.C., and its Northern Virginia suburbs. It contained
technical provisions necessary for the project to begin.
   The measure also contained a provision that would save Amtrak $16
million over two years in unemployment insurance payments for
railroad workers.
