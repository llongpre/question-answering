   When Amtrak launched its new Atlantic City Express last May, it expected gamblers to flock to the shiny trains speeding over newly rebuilt track. 

   But that's not the way it's working out for the nation's first new high-frequency intercity rail passenger corridor in decades. 

   More than just a faster, more convenient way to separate gamblers from their money, the new route was designed to show how the nation can use old rail beds to meet its transportation needs without building new highways and airports. 

   But about 1,000 people a day are riding the trains to and from Atlantic City, less than 30% of what the service needs to break even. 
A few weeks ago Amtrak cut the number of cars on some Atlantic City trains to four from six. 
Even so, some trains are carrying fewer passengers than would fill a 48-seat motor coach. 

   "This thing will wither on the vine if Amtrak doesn't do better than that," says William Finley, a bus greeter at Bally's Park Place Casino Hotel here. 

   The start-up was marred by initial delays that repelled some riders. 
What's more, the new Amtrak station here is separated from the Boardwalk by a cab or bus ride or a mile-long walk past a rescue mission and a shuttered housing project. 
Amtrak officials say they will make major route and schedule changes in September. 
But they dismiss speculation that their role in the $100 million gamble to bring back passenger rail service to Atlantic City is in jeopardy. 

   Amtrak officials criticize Atlantic City casinos, which continue to shower bus and auto visitors with cash, meal coupons and other bonuses but have been slow to offer similar incentives to Amtrak riders. 
Casino officials fault Amtrak for focusing on the short-haul Atlantic City-Philadelphia market more than on longer-distance travelers more inclined to value the added comfort of a train ride. 

   Rail passenger promoters around the country are hoping for the eventual success of the Atlantic City Express to encourage revival of rail in other corridors. 
"Upgrading railroad tracks is a much more efficient way to improve transportation than construction of new highway lanes or airport facilities," said Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, a Washington lobbying group. 

   Amtrak was lured here by the sharp growth in visitors, now estimated at more than 33 million a year, since Atlantic City's first casino opened in 1978. 
Most of them travel to Atlantic City by auto or bus; a few arrive by helicopter or airplane. 
Before it could rebuild the 67-mile rail line between Atlantic City and Philadelphia though, Amtrak had to overcome efforts to derail the project by bus industry lobbyists, Reagan administration budget-cutters and local communities worried about train noise. 

   The previous train service between New York and Atlantic City expired 28 years ago; the previous Atlantic City-Philadelphia service expired 20 years ago, and commuter service on the line withered in the early '80s. 

   Amtrak launched its new train service from Atlantic City to Philadelphia, New York and Washington last May 23. 
New Jersey Transit, which is sharing the cost of restoring the rail route, plans to operate commuter trains over the lines this fall. 

   But luring riders to the Atlantic City Express has proven to be a big headache because of the incentives that casinos give to bus and auto travelers. 
For example, John Russo paid $19 roundtrip last Thursday to board an Atlantic City-bound charter bus a few blocks from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough. 
When Mr. Russo, a local building contractor, presented his bus voucher at a casino change window, he was handed $12 in cash. 
In contrast, Amtrak, which charges $39 for the New York-Atlantic City roundtrip, "gives you absolutely nothing," he said. 

   "Amtrak is trying to get people to pay full fare to the only city in the U.S. where most travelers have their transportation costs subsidized by private industry," said Anthony Marino, deputy executive director of the New Jersey Expressway Authority, operator of a toll highway in southern New Jersey. 

   Casinos have been reluctant to extend incentives to Amtrak passengers for fear that they would only reach the same customers that now arrive by bus. 
"It's not in our interest to pay people to get off a bus and get onto a train," said Thomas Carver, president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, a trade group representing 10 of Atlantic City's 11 casinos. 
Atlantic City's casinos, which last year spent $265 million on travel incentives, are hoping that Amtrak will expand their market beyond the day-trippers, retirees and housewives that now fill the gambling halls. 

   But help is on the way. 
Harrah's Marina Hotel Casino, breaking ranks with its rivals, last month announced that it will grant rail passengers incentives in September. 
Steven Rosen, vice president of marketing of Harrah's, a unit of Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday Corp., said he believes the train will attract higher-income visitors. 
"If they are willing to spend a little more money in the train, obviously they will spend a little more money in the casino," he said. 

   W. Graham Claytor Jr., Amtrak's chairman and president, said that once Harrah's incentives are in place ridership on the Atlantic City Express "will pick up substantially." 
Mr. Claytor added that Amtrak will adjust its Atlantic City schedules to provide more service to longer-distance travelers. 
For example, it will extend its direct New York-Atlantic City train to southern Connecticut and add a weekend roundtrip between Atlantic City and Washington. 
Indeed, buses and autos have proven to have the edge between Philadelphia and Atlantic City because of the time needed to get to the rail stations. 

   Some Atlantic City travelers are impressed with the comfort of the train, which offers more space than the bus and avoids the hassles of driving. 
"My time on the train is very nice," said attorney Emanuel Levin aboard an Amtrak train speeding over newly welded rail at 90 mph across southern New Jersey. 
He is one of four people in the 84-seat coach car. 

   "I like the fact that I have a car to myself, but it's not very good for Amtrak," said Mr. Levin.
