   If you've always wanted to ride a train across
the country, but didn't have the time to take it all the way back,
United Airlines and Amtrak said Monday they've got just the deal
you've been waiting for.
   They unveiled a train-plane ticketing agreement that will offer
passengers a cheaper fare when they fly one way and ride the rails
the other way.
   The setup would also allow travelers to fly into certain major
gateway cities, then take trains around the region before returning
to the gateway city to fly home.
   ``Long-distance train trips have enormous appeal among
prospective Amtrak passengers, but many people lack the vacation
time for a cross-country train trip both ways,'' said Timothy P.
Gardner, Amtrak's vice president of passenger marketing. ``The
Amtrak Air-Rail travel plan will enable travelers to take an
extended train trip and then fly home.''
   In the past, people who rode the train one way and flew a plane
the other way got stuck paying full one-way fares, but United and
Amtrak said their rates on the new tickets will be roughly
equivalent to a round-trip air fare.
   Amtrak intitiated the deal by approaching United about three
years ago, after determining that United's ``route system is a
better match with our route system than the other airlines,''
Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said.
   At least one airline analyst doubted that the train-plane
arrangement will amount to much more than a marketing gimmick.
   ``I don't think there's a big market for it,'' said Raymond E.
Neidl of Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc. ``It might generate some marginal
revenues. I don't think it's going to be that significant.''
   Neidl said that Amtrak service is not widely available outside
the Northeast, which limits the value of the package.
   Amtrak's spokeswoman disagreed, saying that although cities
don't have very many departure and arrival times on the national
railroad, a speedy arrival is not the goal of most train travelers.
   ``That's very true in the west, where we only have one train a
day in each direction,'' Martin said. ``People don't take the train
just to get someplace. They take the train for the experience of
riding the train. People travel from Denver to Salt Lake City for
the experience of traveling through the Rockies at ground level.
It's an experience you don't get from the air.''
   A Washington-based group that promotes rail travel as
environmentally sound was pleased to see the deal come together,
although a spokesman was not familiar enough with travel marketing
to predict how successful it might be.
   ``I think anything that encourages people to take the train on
any part of their journey is desirable,'' said Scott Leonard,
assistant director of the National Association of Railroad
Passengers. Leonard said rail transporation is particularly
important these days, because it is energy-efficient and could cut
the nation's demand for foreign crude oil.
   Gardner predicted Amtrak will attract thousands of passengers
through the deal. A United spokeswoman, Sara Dornacker, said the
airline would not reveal how much extra business it hopes to pick
up.
   ``United's estimate of passenger volumes through this program
are significant,'' she said.
   To illustrate the savings that passengers could achieve through
the deal, Dornacker said the best current one-way air fare from New
York to Los Angeles, combined with a one-way rail fare, would cost
$664. The train-plane ticket would go for $419, for a savings of 37
percent, she said, adding that savings would be similar on other
excursions.
   Amtrak had previously teamed up with another airline, Midway, to
let passengers fly into Philadelphia then use their same ticket to
take a train to Atlantic City. The deal lasted from this past
spring until fall, when Midway got out of its Philadelphia hub.
