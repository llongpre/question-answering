   All 52 cars of a freight train derailed near
here Thursday, halting passenger rail service between Seattle and
Minneapolis and stranding Amtrak passengers, officials said.
   About 10.4 million pounds of corn spilled from the cars, blocking
traffic on both mainline tracks, said Glacier National Park
spokesman Jerry Nelson.
   Gus Melonas, a Burlington Northern Railroad spokesman in Havre,
cars were strewn over a three-mile stretch of track. No one was
injured and the cause of the derailment was under investigation, he
said.
   Most of the 123 passengers on Amtrak's westbound Empire Builder
were stranded in Havre, a town of 10,000 near the Canadian border
and about 200 miles east of the derailment. Most of the passengers
were staying at the LeHavre Inn.
   Shannon Shearer of Bucksport, Maine, said she was traveling to
Spokane, Wash.
   ``The Amtrak people have been super to us. As for what we're
doing in Havre, we're just kind of visiting and taking it all in,''
she said.
   Erling Strandlund, an Amtrak chef, said his train had stopped
Wednesday near Havre just before midnight ``because of engine
troubles and the freezing cold.''
   Temperatures in the area have been hovering at 30-40 degrees
below zero for several days.
   ``We were prepared to head west this morning, but now, with the
derailment ahead to the west, I have no idea how long we'll be
here,'' Strandlund said.
   The derailment near the southern tip of Glacier National Park was
the third in that area in the past six weeks.
   Plans were being made to route freight trains around the
derailment, but Amtrak officials said passenger trains eastbound
from Seattle and westbound from Minneapolis were canceled until
further notice.
   Passengers already in transit between the two cities were being
bused around the derailment, officials said.
