   Senate Republicans are stalling Democratic
efforts to slap President Bush with his first veto override after
the House voted to set aside presidential rejection of an Amtrak
funding bill.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the vote was too
important to the president for a vote Thursday or today with several
Republicans absent. None of Bush's 10 vetoes last year was
overturned, and the Amtrak bill prompted his first veto of 1990.
   Bush told reporters today, ``I think it's going to be very
close'' in the Senate. He said he hoped Congress would sustain his
veto.
   Bush has said he supports the bill's authorization of $2 billion
for Amtrak over the next three years but vetoed the measure because
of a provision that increases government control over freight
railroad buy outs.
   Democrats accused the administration of trying to scuttle support
for the successful national passenger rail service _ a course
followed unsuccessfully by the Reagan administration.
   ``The administration has again showed its opposition to the
funding for Amtrak,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.
   As Republican senators tried to round up votes to protect
presidential prestige, House GOP leaders introduced an alternative
measure that supports Amtrak but leaves out increased Interstate
Commerce Commission authority over rail takeover attempts.
   The ICC already has the power to scrutinize takeovers involving
multiple railroads or a portion of a railroad. The bill would give
it authority over the buy out of a whole railroad by non-rail
interests.
   Bush, in his veto message, called the provision ``a step backward
for the entire rail industry.'' He said it would interfere with the
ability of railroads to obtain financing and be a step towards
re-regulation of the industry.
   Democrats argued that government scrutiny is needed to prevent
corporate raiders from ruining the nation's railroads with leverage
buy outs.
   ``The president is committed to an adequate passenger rail
service,'' said House GOP leader Bob Michel of Illinois. He said
Bush would not veto the measure if it is passed again without the
ICC provision.
   The vetoed bill also contained provisions needed to start a
commuter rail service into Virginia suburbs near Washington, to save
Amtrak $16 million over two years in unemployment insurance for rail
workers and to allow truck, bus and rail workers to file state
income tax in only one state even though they may work in several.
   Exon opened debate on the override in the Senate and tried to
push for a quick vote, but Republicans first failed to field any
response, and then Dole announced he'd prevent a vote.
   ``The trains are going to run whether we do this today, next
Wednesday or a week from Wednesday,'' Dole said.
   The veto has not affected Amtrak operations because the railroad
is working with money that Congress already has appropriated. The
bill envisions more than $2 billion going to the line through Sept.
30, 1992. Actual amounts will be determined when Congress
appropriates the money.
   Democrats are expected to push for a vote on the override again
next week.
   The Amtrak authorization passed the House 322-93 and got
unanimous support in the Senate, but the ICC provision was added
during negotiations between the two houses that produced the final
bill.
   Several Republicans indicated opposition to the Amtrak aid as
well as the leverage buy-out provision.
