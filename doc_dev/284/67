   The government can fine railroads or
individuals up to $20,000 for tampering with locomotive safety
devices under new rules issued by the Federal Railroad
Administration.
   Investigators found that the intentional disabling of a safety
warning device contributed to the collision of an Amtrak passenger
train and a Conrail locomotive, killing 16 people at Chase, Md., two
years ago.
   Since then, government inspectors have found more than 70
locomotives with warning whistles, automatic stopping devices and
other safety systems intentionally diconnected.
   Many of the 25,000 locomotives operated by the nation's railroads
are equipped with one or more of the devices designed to either
record data on the engine's operation or to make it safer, the
administration said in issuing the final rules Thursday.
   The devices range from audible alerts on changing conditions
along the rails, such as speed limits, to devices that stop or slow
the train if the engineer fails to respond.
   Under the new rules, fines include $2,500 for knowingly operating
or permitting the operation of a locomotive with disabled equipment
and $7,500 for tampering with the equipment.
   The administration also has the right to increase the fines to as
high as $20,000 per violation when it finds gross negligence or a
pattern of violations which cause death or injury or create an
``imminent hazard.''
   The Amtrak-Conrail crash on Jan. 4, 1987, was blamed on gross and
willful negligence by the Conrail crew. Conrail engineer Ricky Lynn
Gates pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is serving a five-year
prison term. He admitted the crew had used marijuana before the
accident and violated a number of safety procedures.
   Conrail last July agreed to pay $58 million to survivors of those
killed and Amtrak agreed in August to pay $8.2 million. The
railroads also agreed to create a $9 million fund to pay 330
passengers who filed claims for injuries or distress suffered in the
collision.
