   An Amtrak train was lurching from side to
side and going ``clickety, clickety, clunk'' before it jumped the
tracks, witnesses said. At least 91 people were reported injured,
three seriously.
   ``Last night it seemed like the train just wasn't going right.
It was kind of swaying so much it woke me up,'' Ruby Hall of
Forrest City, Ark., one of the California Zephyr's 394 passengers,
said Monday.
   The train, made up of sections that originated in Seattle, Los
Angeles and Oakland, Calif., was on its way to Chicago with a crew
of 24 when it derailed at the edge of this town of 500, about 90
miles from Des Moines.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
visited the derailment site early today but would not speculate on
the cause of the crash, ``not even rhetorically,'' said Dave
Watson, investigator in charge.
   Larry Allen, assistant transportation superintendent for
Amtrak's Midwest division, said investigators would try to make a
preliminary determination of the cause today, but cautioned:
``It'll take some more work before it gets nailed down.''
   Jasonna Gibson of Schenectady, N.Y., said she was holding her
2{-month-old baby when the train left the tracks. ``The baby
fell,'' she said. ``I tried to get him and a lady fell on me.''
   Eight passenger or baggage cars jumped the tracks: four remained
upright; three were leaning, and one, a sleeper car, was on its
side, said Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin.
   Crews today righted the derailed cars and were shipping them to
Fairfield, about 15 miles east, for inspection and repair. Crews
also went to work on the twisted rail and gouged right-of-way. An
Amtrak official said the double-track route would be open to
regular train traffic later in the day.
   The crew reported to local hospitals for drug and alcohol tests,
as required under federal regulations, said Michael Turner, Amtrak
supervisor of on-board services. Test results were not immediately
available.
   Kathy Hood of Littleton, Colo., said the ride was rough before
the derailment. ``This is my first train ride, but I didn't think
they were supposed to sway so much,'' she said.
   Paula Stater said she was in her home near the tracks just
before the accident and knew knew something wasn't right.
   ``I said to myself, `There goes that Amtrak making that stupid
noise,''' she said. ``But instead of going clickety, clickety,
clack, it was making a clickety, clickety, clunk.
   ``I looked out the window and thought, `Lord, I hope nobody was
killed.'''
   Asked about reports of swaying and noise, Gerry Hester,
transportation superintendent for Amtrak's Midwest division, would
not speculate on the cause of the accident.
   Mike Wenninger, a spokesman for Burlington Northern Railroad, on
whose line the train was operating, said investigators would
interview the crew and witnesses, check if signals were working and
examine the train's speed.
   Wenninger said the Burlington Northern line is kept in ``tiptop
condition and is inspected daily.''
   Ms. Martin said she does not know how fast the train was
traveling but its ``black box'' data recorder should help
investigators. The train is authorized to travel up to 79 mph in
the area of the crash, she said.
   Ms. Martin said 91 people, most of them suffering bumps and
bruises, were taken to hospitals, including 10 crew members.
Fourteen were admitted. ``None of the injuries has been described
as life-threatening,'' she said.
   Three seriously injured passengers were taken by helicopter from
the crash scene to hospitals, officials said. One was admitted to a
cardiac unit with chest pains, one had chest injuries and the third
a badly fractured arm, officials said.
   Ms. Martin said the train was running two hours late because one
section had to detour between Oakland and Sacramento because of a
gasoline spill.
   One car in the train had a car-length gash from hitting a
freight car parked on another track, witnesses said.
   Amtrak arranged for buses to take passengers to Chicago, where
other travel arrangements would be made.
   ``I got to go all the way to New York. I'm not taking a train
back,'' said Ms. Gibson, who joined dozens of other shocked
passengers at a community center where they were given food and
drinks.
