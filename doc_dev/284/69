   A 17-car Amtrak train with more
than 300 people aboard derailed Sunday night during a snowstorm in a
rugged, mountainous canyon, but no injuries were reported,
authorities said.
   The two locomotives and 15 cars went off the track just after 9
p.m. in Glenwood Canyon, said the chief dispatcher's office at the
Rio Grande Railroad in Denver, about 150 miles east of here.
   The train, which had 294 passengers and about 15 crew members,
was en route to Salt Lake City from Denver, John Jacobsen, Amtrak's
director of public affairs, said early Monday from his home in
Washington, D.C.
   ``The cause of the derailment is not known at this time, but all
cars are reported to be upright and in line. We have no reports of
injuries to passengers,'' Jacobsen said.
   ``At this point it doesn't seem to be a serious derailment in
terms of injuries to passengers,'' he said, but a ``complicated
logistics problem.''
   A train headed to the scene to transport the people the 10 miles
to Glenwood Springs, where they would be put up in hotels for the
night.
   Jacobsen said Rio Grande Railroad, which owns the tracks, will
investigate the accident.
