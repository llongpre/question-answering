   An apprentice engineer was at the controls - and
reportedly speeding - when his Amtrak train jumped the tracks in a
station and slammed into a rush-hour commuter train, injuring 264
people, authorities said.
   Published reports today, disputed by Amtrak, said the train was
traveling at least twice the 30 mph limit in Back Bay Station when
it crashed Wednesday morning.
   In Washington, Amtrak spokesman Patrick Jeffery said the train's
speed had yet to be determined.
   ``There were some witnesses who felt the train was going very
fast. We don't base our information on that,'' he said in a
telephone interview. A diagram of the crash did not suggest high
speeds were involved, he said.
   Jeffery confirmed a published report that the apprentice
engineer had begun operating the Washington-Boston line on a
regular basis only on Monday. But he said the apprentice had been
operating trains under supervision since 1987 and had been tested
on his familiarity on that line.
   Amtrak denied inexperience caused the crash because the
apprentice was supervised by an experienced engineer.
   ``He wasn't doing it alone. We don't consider that was a factor
at this point. (But) we really don't know,'' Jeffery said.
   Amtrak's Night Owl from Washington traveled nearly a
quarter-mile after derailing, then struck the rear of the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority train, said Thomas
Glynn, MBTA general manager.
   The impact was so violent that Amtrak cars hit the tunnel's
ceiling and buckled the road above.
   Glynn said 264 people were injured, 10 critically. The commuter
train had its usual load of about 900 passengers, and the Amtrak
train had about 190, he said.
   ``All the lights went out, people started screaming, the place
was filled with smoke, a few people were trapped under seats,''
said commuter Chris Good.
   Most of the injured suffered cuts, bruises, broken bones and
smoke inhalation from a fire caused when 1,500 gallons of spilled
diesel ignited.
   Back Bay Station will be closed until at least Monday while the
wreckage is cleared, and thousands of commuters are taking buses
into downtown Boston.
   ``Commuting is fine this morning. Everything is working fine,''
transit authority spokesman Bob Devin said today. He said MBTA
personnel were stationed around the system to direct commuters
whose routes were changed.
   The apprentice, Richard Abramson, 41, of Trumbull, Conn., had
three years' training on how to operate a locomotive and was
authorized to run a train under a senior engineer's supervision,
said Dave Beatty, Amtrak general supervisor. Abramson was
hospitalized in stable condition with a broken collar bone, an
injured back and facial injuries.
   ``He was qualified to do the job,'' Amtrak spokesman Howard
Robertson said. ``He was qualified in the rules, in the opeation
of the engine, in the route and the rails. He had proper training
and we don't think it (inexperience) had anything to do with the
crash.''
   Abramson was operating the train under the supervision of
25-year veteran engineer Willis Copeland, Beatty said. Copeland,
53, of Bethany, Conn., was critically injured.
   Copeland was the engineer on one of the trains in a head-on
collision in New York City in 1984 in which one person was killed
and 115 were injured, said Amtrak spokeswoman Marci Larson. But
Copeland was ``completely exonerated,'' Larson said.
   The Boston Globe, citing sources it didn't identify, said
Abramson had started operating trains on regular Amtrak routes only
two days before the crash. The Globe said Abramson had worked for
Amtrak since 1973, first as a clerk, then a yard engineer.
   The Globe and the Boston Herald quoted unidentified sources as
saying the Night Owl was traveling at least twice Back Bay
Station's speed limit when it crashed. The train had been scheduled
to stop at the station before heading to its last stop at South
Station in downtown Boston.
   ``We'll be looking at pre-existing damage on the tracks. Same
thing on the wheels of the train,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a member
of a National Transportation Safety Board team dispatched to the
scene. ``We'll look at human performance, what the crew did, their
background.''
   A similar crash occurred at the station between an Amtrak train
and a commuter train in 1987. The NTSB determined that crash, which
caused far less damage, was caused by an improperly designed signal
system, with human error a secondary factor.
   ``We'll be very interested in seeing if there are any
connections,'' said NTSB spokesman Brent Bahler.
   The Federal Railroad Administration also sent inspectors and
subjected the train crews to alcohol and drug tests, mandatory
after serious rail accidents.
   The two Amtrak locomotives and a baggage car were destroyed in
the collision. Fire Lt. Mike Walsh, one of the first on the scene,
said the massive locomotives were twisted ``like a coat hanger.''
   Firefighters emerging from the tunnel said most passengers did
not panic. ``There was an eerie calm,'' Walsh said.
   Some firemen handed oxygen masks to victims. Most of the
passengers were able to walk out of the station, but a number were
carried out on stretchers. At least nine had to be extracted from
the wreckage, Walsh said.
   Passengers emerging from the train described being thrown to the
floor, bruising their faces and necks. They said the lights in the
trains went out, leaving them groping through a dense smoke that
passenger Joe Povoas said ``you could grind with your teeth, you
could spit it out.''
