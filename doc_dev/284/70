   The Amtrak switch operator who last month disappeared for three days after a train went down the wrong track and slammed into maintenance equipment has tested positive for use of marijuana, cocaine and at least one stimulant, federal rail officials said. 

   The Amtrak Night Owl accident occurred shortly after midnight Jan. 29 when the train, en route from Washington to Boston, crashed into the equipment near Chester, Pa. 
Nineteen people were injured in the accident, in which two locomotives derailed and overturned, and all 10 passenger cars derailed. 

   From the start, federal investigators have focused on a possible error by Thomas Connor, who was operating track switches and signals from a nearby tower and should have switched the train onto a clear track before the mishap. 
Shortly after the crash, Mr. Connor fled from his post in midshift, and didn't reappear to meet with investigators until Feb. 1. 

   A spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration stressed that the tests don't indicate the level of drugs in Mr. Connor's system at the time of the accident and don't prove that he was impaired at that time. 
National Transportation Safety Board investigators, mainly through interviews, now will try to determine whether drug use could have caused or contributed to the accident. 

   Mr. Connor submitted blood and urine samples to the railroad agency for drug testing. 
Because the Feb. 1 samples were collected so long after the accident, they were tested for the lowest possible levels of drugs that could be reliably identified -- a more stringent test than usual. 

   Mr. Connor tested positive for marijuana in the blood and urine, and for cocaine, methamphetamine and amphetamine in the urine, although the amphetamine could be a result of the methamphetamine use, the agency said. 

   Arthur Donato, an attorney for Mr. Connor, said that "there is no way that they (the tests) show impairment and they don't support any contention that drugs were used at the time of the accident." 
Mr. Connor has resigned from Amtrak. 

   The agency said Mr. Connor would have tested negatively for cocaine and the stimulants -- but not marijuana -- if the tests had been conducted under the usual, less stringent procedures.
