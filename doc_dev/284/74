   Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed
``inadequate track inspection and maintenance procedures'' by the
Burlington Northern Railroad for the derailment last summer of an
Amtrak passenger train in Montana.
   The train, which was bound from Chicago to Seattle, derailed
Aug. 5 near Saco, Mon., when it struck track that had been warped
by temperatures near 100 degrees. The accident injured 165 people,
about a dozen of them seriously.
   The National Transportation Safety Board in its report on the
accident said Tuesday it was caused by shifting of track just ahead
of the Amtrak train. The board said the shifting was caused by the
intense heat, but that track conditions and the danger of such
buckling should have been apparent to Burlington Northern.
   The probable cause of the accident, said the safety board in its
final report, ``was Burlington Northern's inadequate track
inspection and maintenance procedures which resulted in a thermally
induced lateral shift of the track structure in front of (the)
Amtrak train.''
   The board continued that ``the lateral shift occurred when the
train was closer than the 2,478 feet necessary'' to bring the train
to a safe stop. The train was traveling at an authorized speed of
79 miles an hour.
   ``There was nothing that the engine crew could have done ... to
have avoided or decreased the severity of the accident after they
observed the shifted track,'' said the report.
   The derailment caused five of the train's cars to topple after
leaving the tracks. The 12-car train was carrying 375 passengers
and about a dozen crewmembers.
   The safety board blamed some of the injuries on ``the lack of
effective restraint devices'' that caused some items to fly around
inside the cars. While the board did not fault Amtrak for the
accident, the report called on the passenger railroad to improve
its training and procedures for evacuating passengers in such
circumstances.
   The safety board also called on Burlington Northern to improve
its track inspection procedures and make available to inspectors
devices that could determine when excessive heat might cause track
to warp.
