   In "Tracking Amtrak's Costs" (Letters, Nov. 14), the system's president, W. Graham Claytor Jr., acknowledges substantial losses on the Northeast Corridor (NEC), masking them by arguing marginal profitability of Metroliners. 

   Amtrak argues long-haul trains always cost more if expanded in scope, a linear reality. 
But marginal losses occur only when marginal revenues don't keep pace or grow faster, which they have for years on long-haul trains. 
Long-haul trains are about 30% of Amtrak costs and 70% of transportation revenues. 
What goes on here? 

   "Facing facts" on the NEC requires looking beyond Metroliners and a limited sub-sector market, New York to Washington. 
It means a matrix understanding, expanding the market reach beyond New York and Washington, to unusual places like Richmond, Va., or Portland and Bangor Maine; and more revenue hours of service per NEC-dedicated car.
