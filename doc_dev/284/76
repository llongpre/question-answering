   Lawmakers and federal regulators called for stepped-up drug and alcohol testing for railroad employees and tougher penalties for train operators who tamper with safety devices. 

   At the first congressional hearing after the fatal collision of an Amtrak passenger train and a string of Consolidated Rail Corp. locomotives, a number of senators said that more widespread testing of train operators is needed to identify drug and alcohol abusers before accidents occur. 
The current rule requires tests before an individual is hired, after major accidents and upon reasonable suspicion by a supervisor. 

   The Federal Railroad Administration said last week that tests showed both the Conrail engineer and brakeman had used marijuana sometime before the accident. 
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, hasn't ruled on whether the marijuana use contributed to the accident. 

   The Jan. 4 accident occurred northeast of Baltimore when the Conrail locomotives ran through a stop signal and into the path of an Amtrak train. 
Sixteen people were killed and more than 170 were injured. 

   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) said that after consulting with experts he was convinced that both Conrail crewmen "to put it mildly . . . were certainly under the influence and impaired. 
This clearly calls for Congress to come forward to provide a form of substance abuse detection not after an accident, but before." 

   Amtrak Chairman W. Graham Claytor Jr., testifying yesterday before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, blamed the accident on the "outrageous behavior" of the Conrail crew, and agreed that they "must have been impaired," adding, "I don't know how else you can explain it." 
John Riley, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, said the Conrail engineer either missed or ignored six warning devices on the trackside and in the cab just before the accident. 

   But Larry Mann, an attorney for the Railway Labor Executives' Association, an umbrella railroad-labor group, testifed that the Conrail engineer and brakeman weren't impaired. 
He and other labor representatives said they would oppose any effort to require random drug testing, on constitutional grounds. 

   Mr. Riley told the senators that the agency had gone as far as it believed it could go legally in writing the current drug and alcohol rules, but that he would support congressional efforts to make them tighter. 
He also said he would welcome the authority to make drunk-driving convictions available to rail companies. 

   In addition, Mr. Riley noted that the agency in recent weeks has discovered 10 cases of a warning whistle being disabled in train cabs. 
The agency's review was prompted after federal investigators probing the Jan. 4 accident found that the whistle in the Conrail cab had been disabled by duct tape. 

   Mr. Riley said he hoped Congress would give him the authority to fine individuals who tamper with such devices. 
Currently, the administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration can only fine the company.
