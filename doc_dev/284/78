   Tests showed that the engineer and brakeman of the Conrail locomotive that ran through a stop signal into the path of an Amtrak passenger train had used marijuana, federal officials said. 

   The crewmen "both tested positive for the presence of cannabinoids (marijuana constituents) in both the urine and plasma," the Federal Railroad Administration said in a statement. 
"These findings will be considered with all other evidence developed during the investigation of this accident." 

   The Jan. 4 crash occurred northeast of Baltimore when the Amtrak Colonial rammed the back of a string of Conrail engines, killing 16 people and injuring more than 170. 
Federal investigators increasingly have been focusing on human error following tests suggesting that a crucial warning signal didn't malfunction, as the Conrail engineer has insisted. 

   In its statement, the railroad agency cautioned that the drug-test results "represent only one element of the inquiry into human performance in the circumstances of this accident. 
The findings do not constitute an allegation of fault or determination of probable cause." 

   The statement didn't say when the marijuana use occurred or whether it contributed to the accident. 
Agency officials declined to answer questions. 

   Stephen Tully, an attorney who represents the Conrail engineer, 32-year-old Ricky Gates, said he hadn't yet seen the test results and wouldn't comment. 
Attempts to reach Mr. Gates, the Conrail brakeman Edward Cromwell, and Mr. Cromwell's attorney were unsuccessful. 

   The test results were released as Maryland officials confirmed that Mr. Gates had been arrested in Baltimore County, Md., last month for running a red light and drunken driving. 
In addition, the engineer had been cited for speeding several times in the past 15 years, officials said. 

   The railroad administration said yesterday that it has "no information suggesting the use of alcohol or drugs by Amtrak employees in connection with this accident." 
Samples from the Amtrak engineer, who was killed in the crash, tested negative for alcohol but were insufficient to test for drugs. 
Tests of surviving Amtrak employees showed no traces of alcohol or drugs. 

   Some of the surviving Amtrak crewmen weren't tested, which angered the National Transportation Safety Board, the independent agency heading the investigation. 
Amtrak officials said they didn't conduct the tests because those crewmen weren't involved in running the train. 

   In a statement, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, (D., N.J.), the new chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, called the positive results "a real failure in the system." 
An aide said Sen. Lautenberg, who plans to conduct a hearing Tuesday on the crash, will take a close look at the adequacy of current drug rules for rail employees. 

   Federal rules that took effect last February require drug and alcohol testing after serious accidents, authorize railroads to test employees "on reasonable suspicion of impairment," and mandate pre-employment drug screening. 
The rules have been opposed by the rail employees' unions. 

   Since 1975, there have been 48 train accidents resulting in 37 deaths, 80 injuries and $34 million in property damage in which drug or alcohol use by railroad employees was the cause, the railroad administration said. 

   Separately, an Amtrak train carrying more than 100 passengers derailed in downtown Philadelphia yesterday during the afternoon rush hour. 
Amtrak officials said they had received a report of one possible injury, but that the report hadn't been confirmed. 
The four-car commuter train was bound for Harrisburg, Pa.
