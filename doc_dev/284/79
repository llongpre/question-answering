   With barely a flush of anger, they told tales
of human waste spewing from train toilets onto railworkers and
station platforms.
   Some accused Amtrak, the national passenger rail line, of not
trying to dispose of the problem.
   ``I'm the one being squirted on. He's (Amtrak official) not
being squirted and he's got the attitude,'' George E. Jones, of
Local 24 of the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen, told a
subcommittee hearing of the House Government Operations Committee
on Tuesday.
   Jones and A. Tom Matthews, Utah state chairman of the
Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, showed the panel a
videotape of broadcast news stories illustrating the disposal
problem on the rails, the station platforms and, graphically, the
lens of the camera.
   The hearing resulted from complaints from railworkers and city
officials whose downtown train stations have been sprayed with a
mixture of human urine, feces and shredded toilet paper as the
Amtrak trains pass through or stop.
   Amtrak spokesman Tim Gillespie told the panel the company was in
line with federal regulations because it was exempted in 1976 by
Congress from an order to retrofit all passenger and freight
toilets.
   In addition, he cited a 1978 report by the department of Health,
Education and Welfare _ now the Health and Human Services
Department _ indicating that there ``have been no identifiable
disease outbreaks or illnesses which might be . . . associated with
railroad waste discharge.''
   ``In the absence of a known health risk or the potential of
disease, Amtrak questions the advisability of spending extremely
scarce capital and operating funds to alleviate what essentially
amounts to a problems of aesthetics,'' Gillespie said. The
retrofitting would cost the company at least $34 million, he said.
   ``That is perhaps the most arrogant statement I have seen in a
very long time,'' snapped Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman
of the subcommittee on government activities and transportation.
``It would seem to me that Amtrak would have some kind of concern
for the well-being of people who work on its tracks.''
   Ken Alkema, Utah's director of environmental health, told the
hearing that a 1970 document from the National Communicable Disease
Center indicated that ``we are in essential agreement that a
potential health hazard exists whenever human excreta are disposed
above ground.''
   Alkema said efforts to recruit the Food and Drug Administration
for assistance failed when the FDA said it had ``no enforcement
authority over Amtrak.'' He urged Congress to enact appropriate
legislation.
   Jones, the railway signalman, told of a Aug. 17 incident near
Helper, Utah in which a train that had stopped to transfer a sick
passenger to a local ambulance illegally discharged at least four
waste tanks in front of passengers, police and ambulance workers.
   ``You should have seen those medical people having to walk
through that sewage to put the passenger in the ambulance,'' Jones
said.
   Gillespie said Amtrak had no knowledge of the discharge.
