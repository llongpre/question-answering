Ending a 43-year hiatus, passenger rail service returned to Irvine on Friday 
when the Amtrak commuter train pulled into a new station -- on time and to the 
delight of 25 traffic-weary commuters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic," said Pacific Bell employee Ray Walters, who has been commuting 
on Amtrak from Orange County to Los Angeles for seven years and was glad to 
have a station just five minutes from his El Toro home. "It reduces stress." 
</P>
<P>
With the freeways clogged and commuters looking for an easier way to get to 
work, the commuter train, which runs from San Diego to Union Station in Los 
Angeles, added Irvine to its five other Orange County stops. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the passengers, mostly Irvine and El Toro residents, used to have to 
travel to stations in San Juan Capistrano or Santa Ana to catch a train. 
</P>
<P>
Standing next to Walters was controller Pat Desmond, who calculated he used to 
drive 13 miles just to get to the Santa Ana station from his El Toro home. Now 
he is only 3 1/2 miles away. "I may even bike to the station," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The train, subsidized by the County Transportation Commission, arrives at Union 
Station at 7:25 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A return train leaves Union Station at 5:45 p.m. and arrives in Irvine at 6:43 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the commuter train, which operates only on weekdays, two other 
regularly scheduled Amtrak trains will make stops at the Irvine station each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 million passengers a year now ride eight daily, round-trip Amtrak 
trains between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The old East Irvine passenger train depot closed in 1947. Experts see the new 
$13-million Irvine facility as a way station for van pools, buses and the 
granddaddy of transportation dreams -- a monorail system linking south Irvine 
with the John Wayne Airport and other parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, commuters will even be offered the chance to be picked up at home 
by van and delivered to the station, said Diana Brewer, president of Pinnacle 
Transport Inc., which will operate the transportation service. 
</P>
<P>
The facility's first tenant, scheduled to move in today and Sunday, is the 
nonprofit Irvine Spectrum Transportation Management Assn., which coordinates 
van pools, ride-sharing, bicycle commuting and train travel for employees who 
work at 800 area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Musolf of Sunwest Asset Management Corp., the leasing agent for the 
facility, said she hopes to attract a car rental agency, snack shop and 
newspaper stand to the center, scheduled to open and begin selling tickets by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, commuters seemed to regard the fact that they had to buy their $9 
one-way tickets or $13.50 round-trip tickets on the train as a minor 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd rather get on here, near where they live," said the train's conductor, 
E.B. Burwell Jr., as he scribbled the 6:14 a.m. arrival time in a small book. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we're going to have to pull out," the conductor said as the clock struck 
6:15 a.m. "All aboard!" LEON TEEBOOM
