   Amtrack said delays were likely on its
passenger trains running from New York to Richmond, Va., and other
points south until crews could clear tracks of derailed cars from a
78-car freight train.
   Twelve cars from the train jumped the tracks Thursday evening,
forcing the evacuation of two office buildings and five homes but
causing no injuries, authorities said. Amtrak uses the same track.
   Lt. Michael Reilly of the Fairfax County Fire Department said
the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac train, traveling from
Richmond to Alexandria, derailed around 7:10 p.m. Some of the cars
careened into seven empty freight cars parked on adjacent tracks.
   Ten of the cars contained industrial equipment, while two tank
cars were carrying soybean oil, Reilly said.
   Two office buildings located about a mile from the crash scene
and five nearby homes were evacuated as a safety precaution, Reilly
said.
   The 19 people forced from homes and offices were allowed to
return around 9 p.m., after officials confirmed the derailed cars
contained no hazardous materials.
   Passengers planning to travel on Amtrak between Richmond and New
York were to be bused between Richmond and Washington, D.C., where
they could continue north on Amtrak, said Marci Larson, operations
manager for Amtrak. In addition, Larson said, trains traveling from
New York to Florida and Georgia would be rerouted to Southern
Railway tracks between Washington and Richmond.
