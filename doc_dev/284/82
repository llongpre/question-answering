   A truck driver who ignored a signal gate crashed into an
Illinois commuter train on Thursday, causing a derailment that
injured 58 people, authorities said. In Virginia, a second accident
involving an Amtrak train left 26 people hurt.
   Most of the injuries in both derailments appeared to be minor,
officials said.
   In a third accident in Princeton, Ind., a freight train derailed
and hit tanks containing farm pesticides and fertilizers, releasing
chemical fumes that forced evacuation of 1,300 students from nearby
schools for two hours, police said.
   Tom Perry, a police radio operator, said the CSX Corp. train
apparently ran off the end of a rail spur and struck two trucks
behind a grain elevator and fertilizer company owned by Cargill Inc.
   One woman was in satisfactory condition at Gibson General
Hospital after being splattered with the chemicals. She suffered
irritation of the skin and eyes in the 8:30 a.m. accident,
officials said.
   In Lemont, Ill., the gate was down and warning signals were
activated when the commuter train collision occurred about 7:25
a.m. some 40 miles southwest of Springfield, said Will County
Sheriff John Johnsen.
   ``The indication is that the driver of the truck ignored the
signals and drove around the gates,'' Johnsen said. The train
carried 98 people.
   The collision tore off the rear axle of the truck and its
storage bin, carrying it down the tracks about a quarter of a mile,
officials said.
   The truck driver, James Krueger of Sauk Village, was listed in
fair condition at Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet. Three others
were reported in fair condition at the hospital.
   ``I was reading my newspaper, and all of a sudden, I just heard
a loud boom,'' said passenger Jim Kaynish of Joliet. ``The lights
went out, and a couple of seconds later, it felt like we were going
through a bumpy field.''
   None of the passengers in his car appeared to be injured,
Kaynish said. People in the first car were covered ``from head to
toe'' with dust from the gravel, he said. The train carried 98
passengers.
   Damage to equipment amounted to at least $1 million, said Chris
Knapton, a spokesman for the Metra commuter rail line in Chicago.
He said one of the passenger cars was totally destroyed and the
others required repair. Damage to the locomotive would not be
assessed until it could be righted, he said.
   In addition, the collision ``chewed up about 750 feet of track
that will have to be replaced,'' Knapton said. The track belongs to
Illinois Central Gulf, he said.
   Officials from Amtrak, which also uses the line, said trains
between Chicago and Springfield and Chicago and St. Louis were
rerouted.
   In the second passenger accident, six cars and both engines of
an Amtrak train carrying 519 passengers derailed near the
Virginia-North Carolina border, authorities and witnesses said.
   The derailment occurred at 2:08 p.m. near Skippers, about 50
miles south of Richmond, said Amtrak supervisor Sam Wilson. The
train was traveling from Tampa, Fla., and Miami to New York.
   Six people with minor injuries were admitted to Halifax Memorial
Hospital in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., said spokeswoman Val Short.
   Twenty people, most of them complaining of back and neck pains,
were treated at Greensville Memorial Hospital in Emporia, said
spokesman Dave Magruder. One woman was transferred to the Medical
College of Virginia Hospitals in Richmond for treatment of a back
injury; another woman was admitted to Greensville, but Magruder
said he didn't know the extent of her injuries.
   The cause of the derailment was not known, said Clifford Black,
an Amtrak spokesman in Washington.
