<HEAD>Overheated Wiring Blamed In Nebraska Amtrak Fire</HEAD>

   Overheated wiring is believed to have caused a
fatal fire Feb. 20 aboard a passenger train in Nebraska, an Amtrak
spokeswoman said Friday.
   ``This is a preliminary determination, and the official cause of
the fire will be announced at the appropriate time by the National
Transportation Safety Board,'' said the spokeswoman, Debbie
Marciniak.
   The fire broke out in a crew car on Amtrak's California Zephyr
as the Chicago-bound train was pulling into Hastings, Neb., 150
miles west of Omaha.
   A crew member died of smoke inhalation. Nineteen other crew
members, passengers, police and firefighters were treated at
hospitals for smoke inhalation.
   Ms. Marciniak said the burned car was inspected March 1 by a
private fire investigator and by representatives of the Federal
Railroad Administration, the NTSB, the Nebraska Fire Marshal's
office, Amtrak and one of its unions.
   Preliminary reports show the fire originated in wiring in the
wall behind a heater in the luggage compartment of the crew car,
she said.
   ``Rubber insulation became separated from the wiring because of
extensive tightening of the plastic straps that were used to bundle
the wires. Overheating was caused by the reduced insulation,'' Ms.
Marciniak said.
   ``The plastic straps began to melt due to the extreme heat,
dripping burning globs of plastic on the wooden floor, causing the
floor to catch fire. Then the flames proceeded into the body of the
car.''
   Ms. Marciniak said Amtrak already has taken steps to prevent a
recurrence.
   ``We've disconnected power-source wiring on cars of this type,''
she said. ``We are adding a stainless steel plating to the floors
to prevent fire from spreading.''
   There were no smoke detectors on the train, but because of the
fire, Amtrak began installing them in all crew cars and is
considering using them in passenger sleepers.
   NTSB spokesmen in Chicago did not return a telephone call Friday
evening.
