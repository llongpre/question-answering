   A wildcat strike this morning by 780 track
workers on rail lines to the city's northern suburbs and
Connecticut forced 95,000 commuters to scramble to get to work. A
judge later ordered the employees back to work.
   Teamsters Local 808 set up picket lines at Grand Central
Terminal and several other stations, and other unions, including
train engineers, honored the picket lines, said Metro-North
Commuter Railroad spokeswoman Susan Gilbert.
   ``We are not running trains on any of the lines,'' Ms. Gilbert
said.
   By 11 a.m., the railroad obtained a back-to-work order from U.S.
District Judge Inzer Wyatt, Gilbert said.
   ``If it's legitimate and our lawyers tell us its legal, of
course we'll comply,'' said John Mahoney, union secretary-treasurer.
   A spokesman for the National Mediation Board, which oversees
railroad labor disputes, said the strike was illegal.
   In Chicago today, an estimated 2,600 employees went on strike
against the Chicago &amp; North Western railroad in a walkout timed to
begin as soon rush hour ended to avoid disruptions. C&amp;NW is a
leading Midwestern freight hauler and also runs commuter trains
serving 40,000 people a day in Chicago's suburbs.
   The fate of the evening rush hour remained in the hands of
Congress, where the House today was to consider a measure imposing
a settlement.
   The New York City strike, prompted by overtime practices that
the union said endangers passengers, forced thousands of commuters
to find other ways to get to work. Metro-North, caught by surprise
by the walkout, had no contingency plan.
   ``I am advising people to either take regularly scheduled buses
or somehow get to the Bronx to take subways,'' Ms. Gilbert said.
   At Pelham, north of the city, commuters piled into taxis for a
$4 ride to a Bronx subway station. ``This is screwing everything
up, isn't it?'' said one man.
   As a cab driver pondered whether to take a fifth passenger, the
dispatcher cajoled him over the radio, ``Tell them to sit closer to
the driver. No extra charge.''
   Cars headed for Manhattan from the northern suburbs backed up
during the morning rush, and traffic on Connecticut highways into
New York was heavier than usual, police said.
   At a Bronx subway stop, a man in cufflinks who would not give
his name looked long and hard before deciding that the newsstands
did not carry the Wall Street Journal.
   The walkout was prompted by the suspension of 37 employees
Tuesday for refusing to work overtime, the union said. Union
members said the men had been handling 400-pound bridge timbers for
eight hours and wanted to go home.
   ``The quality of work is diminished by fatigue and fatigue
creates lack of safety for workers and commuters,'' said a striker,
Mike Pearson.
   The union said in a statement that it was forced to strike ``to
force the railroad to recognize its responsibility to provide a
safe railroad for its commuters and its employees.''
   Local 808 has been without a contract since January 1986.
Negotiations under way since 1985 have been stalled, Mahoney said.
Metro-North trains, serving 95,000 commuters daily, run between
Manhattan and the city's northern suburbs and Connecticut.
   ``It's an illegal strike,'' said Charles Barnes, executive
director of the National Mediation Board. ``It's a disruption of
the status quo by the union. I should think that as soon as they
can get to a judge, it will stop.''
   Commuters who tried to board Amtrak trains at Bridgeport,
Stamford or New Haven in Connecticut or in New Rochelle, the only
stops Amtrak make along Metro-North routes, were told they would
have to buy a trip to Newark, N.J., even if they wanted to get off
in New York City.
   ``We don't sell tickets, today or any day, from New Haven to
Penn Station (New York),'' said Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black.
``We are not a commuter railroad. That is the territory and
business of Metro-North.''
   Amtrak operations were not immediately affected by the strike,
but Black said Amtrak depends on Metro-North dispatchers for all
trains the run north of New York City. ``We have ordered back-up
buses in the event that we have to ferry passengers over
Metro-North territory
   The picket lines at Grand Central went up about 4 a.m., said
Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
