   Twenty Amtrak trains were either delayed or
cancelled Wednesday, with passengers put on buses as heavy rain
covered tracks along sections of the railroad's heavily traveled
Northeast corridor.
   Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said about 10,000 passengers were
affected by the flooding that covered tracks north of Wilmington,
Del., with six inches of water and debris. One of three lines was
reopened Wednesday afternoon, but repair crews were working to build
up the damaged roadbed on the other two.
   Trains were creeping through the area at 5 mph, said Black,
delaying by about 30 minutes service on regular trains and the
Metroliner express between New York City and Washington.
   Metroliner trains from both directions between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
EDT were cancelled, Black said. The train normally runs ever hour
from both New York and Washington, with regular trains on the half
hour.
   ``Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train
operations severly disrupted,'' Black said shortly before noon.
Later, he said the rains had abated and full service was being
resumed, but with delays still anticipated through the rest of the
day.
   The rains came as part of the remains of Tropical Storm Allison,
which dumped rain on the South for more than a week. Heavy rains
battered the Maryland-Delaware area and Philadelphia early
Wednesday. The city got 5.5 inches of rain in two hours.
   Black said rainfall in the Wilmington area was about 6 inches in
two hours.
   Special buses set up to carry Amtrak passengers between
Wilmington and Philadelphia and earlier between Wilmington and
Baltimore were having difficulty because of flooding on roads near
the tracks, he said.
   The normally 25-minute trip between Wilmington and Philadelphia
was taking more than two hours, Black said.
   He said several trains had to reverse direction and return to the
stations they left, including two in Baltimore, several in
Philadelphia and one at Wilmington.
