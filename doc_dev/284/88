   Amtrak workers plan pickets and rallies in 25
cities Friday to appeal for higher wages and better working
conditions, but a railroad official says no disruptions in service
are expected.
   The Railway Labor Executives Association, speaking for 16 Amtrak
unions, accused the federally subsidized railroad of ``courting a
national strike'' by trying to cut employee benefits. The pickets
also will protest poor working conditions aboard trains, the unions
said.
   The last wage agreements were signed in 1986 and talks between
Amtrak and the individual unions are at various stages.
   Union leaders say they are being asked to take pay and benefit
cuts of up to 20 percent as Amtrak revenue is improving and
ridership is at record levels.
   ``The picketing Friday will be a warning to Congress and the
public,'' said Ed Wytkind, spokesman for the unions.
   An announcement described the planned picket lines and rallies as
``an attempt to avoid a nationwide strike against Amtrak.''
   The unions said they will protest ``substandard wages, unsafe and
unsanitary working conditions, contracting out and outright
union-busting.''
   Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said officials expect the picketing
to cause no disruptions in service on the railroad's 24,000 miles of
rails serving 500 communities. She said no workers are expected to
walk off the job.
   ``I think we're a long way from a strike,'' she said.
   Ms. Martin said the company has been negotiating with the unions
separately for several months, with both sides applying for federal
mediation in some of the talks.
   She acknowledged that under present contracts, union workers earn
an average of about 12 percent less than employees of other
railroads, but said salaries are ahead of those for similar jobs in
other industries.
   For example, she said, employees who help passengers with luggage
make $23,000 a year, compared to $12,000 to $16,000 for similar jobs
at airports.
   Ms. Martin said the company is taking steps to improve safety and
sanitary conditions in 35 cars used to accommodate on-train
employees, including installation of emergency windows in all rooms
and overhaul of the cars to meet the same standards as passenger
cars. Eighteen of the crew cars have so far been refurbished, she
said.
   An employee was killed in a fire aboard a dormitory car last year.
   Joel Parker, a spokesman for on-board union employees, said
company demands would amount to $100-a-week pay cuts for some
workers.
   He said the union objects to the contracting out of reservations
work and could call a strike on that issue.
   Ms. Martin confirmed that some reservations work will be handled
by outside employees for the peak summer months. However, she said
that is allowed by union agreements and the outside workers will
supplement union workers, not replace them.
   The unions announced rallies in Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif.;
Chicago; Boston; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; Baltimore; and
Wilmington, Del. It also said picket lines will be set up at
stations in Seattle; Denver; Atlanta; Indianapolis; New Orleans;
Lorton and Richmond, Va.; New York City; Albany, N.Y.; Canton, Ohio;
Pittsburgh and Altoona, Pa.; Washington D.C., and Sanford, Tampa,
Jacksonville and Miami, Fla.
