   Investigators said they found evidence a
portion of track shifted before an Amtrak train derailed, injuring
95 people.
   Susan Coughlin, vice chairwoman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, and Dave Watson, investigator in charge for the NTSB,
said Tuesday there were ``very slight indications'' of movement
where the train left the tracks Monday.
   ``There's ballast underneath that track, and anytime that
ballast could shift or the soil could become wet,'' Ms. Coughlin
said. ``It's not a static situation out there.''
   However, Ms. Coughlin said, ``We are not in a position at this
point to interpret any of the findings.''
   Amtrak's California Zephyr was headed to Chicago from the West
Coast with 396 passengers and a crew of 24 when it derailed on
track owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad.
   About a dozen people remained hospitalized Tuesday, three with
what Ms. Coughlin said were serious injuries.
   An eight-member NTSB team is leading the investigation, which
also involves about 40 officials from the Federal Railroad
Administration, the state Transportation Department, Amtrak, the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Burlington Northern.
   The FBI also is investigating the possibility of sabotage, Ms.
Coughlin said at a news conference Tuesday night. The 24-member
crew was tested for drug and alcohol use and those results were
expected in about two days, she said.
   She also said it appeared the Zephyr had not exceeded the 79 mph
speed limit.
   In addition to checking the stability of the track today,
investigators planned to concentrate on a switching device in
Batavia and a 1,240-foot stretch of track from where the train
passed a grade crossing to where it derailed, she said.
   Ms. Coughlin said a fireman who was a qualified engineer was at
the controls as the train crossed a grade crossing just south of
town.
   ``Approximately 1,500 feet later, the fireman who was operating
as the engineer felt the train drag. Up to that point, they
detected nothing abnormal in the performance of the train,'' Ms.
Coughlin said.
   ``He looked back and saw that the rear cars were swaying. He put
his train then into an emergency braking.''
   Ms. Coughlin declined to say whether braking was the correct
procedure.
   Behind the investigators, crews went to work on the twisted rail
and gouged right-of-way in this town of 525 people, situated 90
miles southeast of Des Moines. The double-track route was not
expected to reopen until late today.
