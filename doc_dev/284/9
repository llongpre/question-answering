NO MORE CANADIAN CHOO-CHOO

They called it the world's most spectacular railroad journey, the 4,000-mile 
route across all of Canada, and undoubtedly it was -- especially the famed 
stretch of track through the Canadian Rockies. A century of history and 
tradition came to an end last weekend, however, when the jewel of that nation's 
railroad passenger system, the Canadian, made its final transcontinental 
journey. The Canadian is gone, and there is serious question about whether the 
network's other train routes will survive.

In somewhat the same way the U.S. government had done, Canada formed its own 
rail passenger line, Via Rail, in 1977. But even with billions of dollars of 
investment, passenger ridership continued to decline.

The Times' Mary Williams Walsh this week quoted a former conductor as saying: 
"It appears to us that over the years they have deliberately tried to run down 
the train so far that people would say, 'The hell with it -- I'm going to 
drive.' " Sound familiar? That same barb was aimed at American railroads back 
in the 1960s as their owners attempted to dump unprofitable passenger runs.

But just as the Mulroney government was giving up on the Canadian, Amtrak, the 
U.S. National Railroad Passenger Corp., reported that it collected record 
income of $1.3 billion last year. Ridership is at an all-time high. The 
California Zephyr, which runs between Chicago and San Francisco, with branch 
lines to Los Angeles and Seattle, is booked solid for weeks or months in 
advance during vacation periods. Amtrak has introduced nonstop express 
Metroliners in an effort to compete directly with airline shuttle service 
between New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the Reagan Administration tried to do to Amtrak what Mulroney has 
done to Via Rail. Fortunately, Congress resisted and maintained the federal 
subsidy to the independent rail passenger corporation. The investment in new 
equipment and improved roadbeds has paid off handsomely. The federal subsidy 
now is lower than it was five years ago. Service is much better. Amtrak 
President W. Graham Claytor Jr. says the system might be able to cover all its 
operating costs by the turn of the century. No national rail system does that 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it never fully pays its way, Amtrak is a valuable national asset. As 
aging airports become ever more crowded and freeways more jammed, rail service 
will be an increasingly attractive transportation alternative for Americans, 
especially as technology brings about improved comfort, safety and speed. As 
Americans bid adieu to the Canadian, they look forward to even better train 
service in the United States.
