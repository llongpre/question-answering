   Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation, had record revenues of $1.27 billion last fiscal year,
the quasi-government corporation reported.
   That income covered 72 percent of costs for the railroad
passenger operation, up from 69 percent a year earlier and the
highest revenue-to-cost ratio in the agency's history, Amtrak said
Monday.
   As resently as 1981, Amtrak revenues covered less than half of
its costs. The difference between costs and revenues is made up by
federal appropriations.
   The revenues of $1.27 billion were up from $1.1 billion a year
earlier, Amtrak reported.
   The total number of passengers carried was down slightly, from
21.5 million to 21.4 million. But passenger miles, defined as
carrying one passenger one mile, rose from 5.7 billion in 1988 to
5.9 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1989.
