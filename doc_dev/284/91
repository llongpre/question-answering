Twenty Amtrak trains were either delayed or canceled today, with passengers put 
on buses as heavy rain covered tracks along sections of the railroad's heavily 
traveled Northeast corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said about 10,000 passengers were affected by the 
flooding that covered tracks north of Wilmington, Del., with 6 inches of water 
and debris. One of three lines was reopened this afternoon, but repair crews 
were working to build up the damaged roadbed on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Trains were creeping through the area at 5 m.p.h., said Black, delaying by 
about 30 minutes service on regular trains and the Metroliner express between 
New York City and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whole Area Snarled 
</P>
<P>
Metroliner trains from both directions between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. were 
canceled, Black said. The train normally runs every hour from both New York and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train operations severly 
disrupted," Black said shortly before noon. Later, he said the rains had abated 
and full service was being resumed, but with delays still anticipated through 
the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The rains came as part of the remains of Tropical Storm Allison, which dumped 
rain on the South for more than a week. Heavy rains battered the 
Maryland-Delaware area and Philadelphia early today. Philadelphia got 5.5 
inches of rain in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Black said rainfall in the Wilmington area was about 6 inches in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Special buses set up to carry Amtrak passengers between Wilmington and 
Philadelphia and earlier between Wilmington and Baltimore were having 
difficulty because of flooding on roads near the tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The normally 25-minute trip between Wilmington and Philadelphia was taking more 
than two hours, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
He said several trains had to reverse direction and return to the stations they 
left, including two in Baltimore, several in Philadelphia and one at 
Wilmington.
