Amtrak, the US government-owned passenger rail company, yesterday announced
plans to cut its workforce by a quarter and shut 21 per cent of its routes
in an effort to drag itself out of the red for the first time in six years.
The Amtrak board approved elimination of three main routes in the west and
midwest, shutdown of segments of 10 other routes and frequency cuts on other
routes - including even Amtrak's flagship Metroliner service between
Washington and New York.
Cuts will be phased in from April next year, and will lead to elimination of
about 5,400 jobs - including 600 management jobs which the company has
already said it would cut.
Mr Tom Downs, Amtrak's president, said the cuts would reduce revenue by
Dollars 66m (Pounds 42.3m) a year but cut expenses by Dollars 430m. Even
though phased in, he said, they should produce a balanced budget by the end
of this fiscal year on September 30. Without the changes, Mr Downs said,
Amtrak faced a Dollars 200m cash shortfall this year, despite an Dollars
822m federal government subsidy.
Amtrak was created in 1971 with what was intended to be a once-and-for-all
subsidy of Dollars 140m and a mandate to 'operate rail service on a
for-profit basis. It has since cost taxpayers about Dollars 16bn.
The company said yesterday its financial weakness was attributable to 'an
undercapitalised system being spread too thin, trying to provide more
service than the corporation is capable of providing, and to brutal price
competition from the airlines.'
This ought to be the best of times for Amtrak: frequent air crashes,
especially of smaller commuter airlines, should have presented a golden
opportunity to win passengers back - although Amtrak has had its own share
of crashes in recent years.
However, the number of travellers fell by about 300,000 last year to 22m and
it faces increasing demands from the freight companies over whose tracks it
runs.
Amtrak has also been obliged to keep open many unprofitable routes.
