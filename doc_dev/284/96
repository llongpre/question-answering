   The head of Amtrak said Thursday that the
commuter railroad would continue limited operations for only a few
days if picketed by workers supporting any strike against Eastern
Airlines.
   W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, also said that if
Eastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket the
railroad, Amtrak would add trains between New York and Washington
and possibly between New York and Boston.
   Claytor told the Senate transportation appropriations
subcommittee that based on public statements by union leaders, he
considered it likely that a strike against Eastern would result in
picketing against the railroad by union members seeking to disrupt
transportation.
   Outside the hearing room, he told reporters that management
personnel would operate the trains, and that Amtrak would be able to
provide limited service on its routes ``for at least a day or two,
and then shut down altogether.''
   He said the railroad could not function for much longer because
of rules regulating the number of hours railway employees can work.
   Asked which Amtrak workers could be expected to cross a picket
line, he said, ``Nobody.''
   He said if there were no pickets against Amtrak, there would be

<HEAD>Common Market Nations Agree To Seek Chlorfluorocarbon Ban</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Ozone</HEAD>

   Environmental officials from the 12
European Economic Community nations agreed Thursday to sharply
reduce their use of chlorofluorocarbons, the compounds that are
destroying the Earth's ozone layer.
   The ministers agreed to cut chlorofluorocarbon production by 85
percent as soon as possible and to seek a total ban on the synthetic
substances by the end of the century.
   Chlorofluorocarbons are used in aerosal sprays, refrigeration
coolants and a variety of other products. The compounds are blamed
for depletion of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the
sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.
   The ministers agreed to give the EEC Commission a mandate to
completely phase out the manufacture and use of chlorofluorocarbons
by the year 2000.
   The commission will represent the 12 nations at the international
conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone issue and
monitor application of an international accord called the Montreal
Protocol.
   This protocol, signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32, took
effect on Jan. 1 and is intended to reduce the production and use of
chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent from current levels by 1998.
   The EEC ministers also gave a mandate to the commission to
encourage other countries to sign and ratify the protocol.
   The EEC member states are responsible for about half the world's
annual chlorofluorocarbon production of 1 million tons, with Britain
leading in both production and exports, according to the
London-based environmental group Greenpeace.
   Greenpeace says Britain exported chlorofluorocarbons to 117
countries in 1988, 81 of which had not signed the Montreal Protocol.
   Greenpeace said that ``between 1979 and 1986 the ozone layer over
the EEC has already been depleted by an average of 3 percent. This
rises to nearly 7 percent in the winter.''
   Ministers from countries which have ratified the Montreal
Protocol are to meet in London March 5-7 and a further conference is
scheduled in Helskinki, Finland, on May 2-5 to monitor the
application of the protocol.
