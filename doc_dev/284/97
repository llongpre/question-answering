FT  29 AUG 94 / Fast trains a long time coming: US railways remain stuck in
the slow lane

The US exists in a time warp when it comes to rail services. Chugging along
at a maximum speed of 79 miles per hour, its passenger trains have been left
behind by developments in rail transport technology. The Sunset Limited, a
prestige transcontinental service, takes three days to hurtle from Los
Ang-eles to Miami, averaging 42 mph.
Just for a while, it seemed that the US might be ready to take a leap into
the high-speed era. In Texas, a private sector consortium planned to link
the state's biggest cities with a 200 mph system based on France's train a
grande vitesse. The consortium had a franchise from the state government and
a detailed financing plan. But 10 days ago the project collapsed through
lack of funds.
Is that the end of the American flirtation with high-speed rail? Possibly
not. Increasing strains on road and air transport have led to a
proliferation of ideas for high-speed and magnetic levitation rail systems
in the US. The difficulty is getting them off the drawing board.
The big problem any US rail project faces is that most Americans never take
trains. Fuel is so cheap and car ownership so widespread that people use the
roads for short-to-middle distance journeys. Over longer distances, where
rail cannot compete with air travel, they take the plane.
In Texas, the competition weighed even more heavily against the state's
high-speed rail project because the cities it would have served - Dallas,
San Antonio and Houston - were linked not only by good roads, but by
Southwest Airlines, one of the lowest-cost airlines in the US.
Speeding up trains on existing lines might seem a cheaper solution but is
not easily done. While US passenger trains are run by Amtrak, a public
sector corporation, the rail tracks are owned by private sector freight
railroads, so passenger trains have to jostle for space with slow-moving
freight trains. And even when there is no freight train ahead, passenger
trains cannot exceed 79 mph because of the technical limitations of the
signalling systems.
A notable exception to this general rule is the north-east corridor between
Washington, New York and Boston, where Amtrak runs the tracks as well as the
trains. Here, it already runs the 125 mph Metroliner service. Soon, it plans
to increase speeds to 150 mph by upgrading the tracks and buying new trains.
In the rest of the US, however, entirely new rail systems will be needed.
Paradoxically, these look more likely after the failure of the Texas
project. This is because state and federal governments now accept that the
private sector alone cannot build profitable high-speed railways.
The most promising scheme is in Florida, where the state government is
preparing to invite bids for the construction of a high-speed system linking
Tampa, Orlando and Miami. Unlike the government of Texas, which barred
public sector involvement in its high-speed scheme, Florida's government
says it is prepared to pay up to 100 per cent of the constructions costs and
cover up to 50 per cent of any operating deficit, if that is what it takes
to get the system built.
Finding the cash, however, is another matter: Florida's department of
transportation says any state contribution would be subject to the
availability of funds, and it doesn't have the money right now. And planning
the project will take so many years that, if the railway is built at all, it
is unlikely to be until well into the next century. Like US passenger trains
today, it seems, high-speed rail is going to be a long time coming.
