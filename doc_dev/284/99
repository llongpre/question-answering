<LEADPARA>  A study on passenger rail service over the Altamont Pass could get under way
as early as this summer, a San Joaquin County official said Thursday.;    The
$600,000 study will focus on whether it's financially possible to start a
commuter rail or high-speed inter-city rail service over the Altamont Pass, a
major transportation corridor linking the San Joaquin Valley to the Bay Area.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     County Transportation Coordinator Doralee Boles told members of the state
Department of Transportation Rail Task Force steering committee that a request
for proposals will be sent out sometime this summer to consultants interested
in doing the study.;    San Joaquin County plans to pay for the study with a
combination of state rail bond money and funds raised by Measure K, the
countywide transportation half-cent sales tax initiative approved by voters in
November 1990.;    Stanislaus and Alameda counties as well as the Bay Area's
Metropolitan Transportation Commission have been invited to participate, Boles
said.;    The Rail Task Force consists of representatives from throughout the
valley, Bay Area and Southern California served by Amtrak passenger trains.;  
 Steve Alston, a spokesman for the rail division of the state Department of
Transportation, told the Rail Task Force Amtrak rail service from Stockton to
Sacramento could start as early as April 1992.;    A Stockton-to-Sacramento
Amtrak link and an Altamont Pass passenger rail service have been two priority
goals of the task force.;    The Altamont rail study is expected to take a
year to 18 months to complete. It will not, however, look at the possibility
of putting passenger trains over the Panoche Pass farther to the south as an
alternative to the Altamont Pass.;    San Joaquin County leaders have been
lobbying for years for state rail officials to take a serious look at
passenger rail service over the Altamont Pass to ease the growing congestion
on highways caused by the boom in commuter traffic between the
Modesto-Stockton area and the Bay Area.;    The state has preferred to let
local governments take the lead on the Altamont study, Boles noted.;    The
study will look at the cost of starting up Altamont rail service on existing
Union Pacific track and other alternatives.;    Talk about extending the Bay
Area Rapid Transit rail system from the East Bay into the valley over the
Altamont Pass has been dampened by $40 million a mile it would cost, Boles
said.;    The San Joaquin County study will look at BART in addition to
alternatives to BART, including routing Amtrak passenger rail service over the
Altamont Pass and starting up new high-speed rail or commuter trains.;    "We
see rail as answering three of our most vital problems," Stockton Mayor Joan
Darrah said. "The first is traffic congestion. The second is air pollution,
and the third is economic development."  </TEXT>
