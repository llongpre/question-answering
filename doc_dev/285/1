   The New York City-based Museum of the American
Indian, which has long been searching for a more spacious home,
would move and stay in the same place under a compromise plan
revealed Tuesday.
   But as soon as the plan was announced, objections were raised by
the Smithsonian Institution, which has a stake in the negotiations.
   Under the proposal, the bulk of the museum collection would move
into the Custom House in lower Manhattan, while its current upper
Manhattan site remains open and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii,
pursues a plan for a National Museum of the American Indian in
Washington. The national museum would be part of the Smithsonian
Institution and have borrowing privileges from the New York Indian
museum.
   ``Instead of one museum, we get three,'' Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., said in announcing the plan. He was flanked by
Inouye, who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs, and Reps. Charles Rangel and Ted Weiss, both New York
Democrats.
   However, Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams later issued a
statement calling the Smithsonian's association with the plan
``unwise and unworkable.''
   In a letter to Inouye released late Tuesday, Adams detailed his
objections, which include building a new museum to house borrowed
objects; placing undue financial burdens for the facility on the
Smithsonian; and not giving the Smithsonian sufficient authority
over the new museum.
   The Museum of the American Indian long has been starved for
space, visitors and funding. The 15,000-square-foot building in a
decaying neighborhood is too small to display more than about 1
percent of its million-artifact collection at a time, so most of
the objects have languished in a Bronx warehouse.
   The compromise was aimed at resolving a longstanding dispute
over where to house the collection amassed by George Gustav Heye
and established by his will. The trust stipulates that the
collection remain in New York state, spurring New York officials to
rebuff an offer in 1986 by Texas tycoon H. Ross Perot to move the
museum to Dallas.
   Adams suggested that the Smithsonian ``stand aside at this time
so that the possibility of making the New York Custom House
available to the Heye Foundation can be pursued.''
