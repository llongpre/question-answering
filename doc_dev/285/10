   The House approved a bill Monday to transfer a
priceless collection of Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of
the American Indian to the Smithsonian Institution for display in
museums in Washington and New York.
   The measure may at long last make peace among politicians,
native Americans and archaeologists, first by resolving a
10-year-old dispute in New York over how to display and preserve
the Heye Foundation collection of more than a million Indian
artifacts.
   Second, it stipulates that the Smithsonian Institution, where
possible, return its collection of some 18,000 Indian remains to
their original tribes for burial.
   The question of the remains had been the last obstacle to
crafting a passable bill, and compromise came in September, when
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams reversed the museum's
long-held policy that the bones were necessary for study. Indians
nationwide, seeking to bury their ancestors, heralded his decision
as a watershed that will influence other museums.
   The House passed the measure on a voice vote. A similar bill
passed the Senate on Oct. 3., but because of slight differences in
the two bills' language, Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, planned
to ask the Senate to approve the House version Tuesday, said Inouye
spokeswoman Pat Zell.
   ``Sen. Inouye has asked for the consent of the Senate to bring
up the bill as amended and have the Senate approve that bill and
send it directly to the White House,'' Zell said Monday.
   Suzan Shown Harjo, a trustee of the Museum of the American
Indian, was confident that the Senate would go along with the plan.
   The bill passed Monday would establish a Museum of the American
Indian in the last available space on the Washington Mall, between
the National Air and Space Museum and the Capitol. There the
Smithsonian would erect an 82,500 square foot building financed
two-thirds with private donations and one-third with public money.
   The bill further states that a satellite museum, the George
Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian,
would be established in the old U.S. Custom House in lower
Manhattan. Both New York state and New York City have pledged to
contribute up to $8 million apiece toward converting the building
for that use. The federal government would chip in another $8
million under the bill.
