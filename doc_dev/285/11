   The skeletal remains of thousands of American
Indians will be buried in their native soil under an agreement
announced today by the Smithsonian Institution, members of Congress
and Indian leaders.
   ``Today, a process has started that will allow the ancestors of
native Americans to at last find their final resting place,'' said
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs. ``It's a day that will be celebrated by
Indian leaders throughout Indian country.''
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., an American Indian who was
instrumental in achieving the compromise, said the provisions would
be included in a bill before the House that will establish a
National Museum of the American Indian in Washington.
   ``Under this agreement, the Smithsonian is going to inventory the
human remains and funerary objects, which are those objects that are
placed in gravesites with Indian people when they are buried,''
Campbell said at a news conference.
   ``Those remains that can be identifed, either specifically or by
the name of tribe, the Smithsonian will notify the individuals in
the tribe and the tribe will be able to have them returned to them.''
   The agreement represents a change of thinking by the
administration of the Smithsonian, which previously had said the
bones were necessary for scientific study, said institution
Secretary Robert McC. Adams.
   ``I should make clear there's a deep sense of loss on the part of
many scientists at the Smithsonian,'' he said.
   But Adams said he was persuaded by years of listening to
anguished Indians and reading about the atrocities committed against
Indians during this country's western expansion.
   ``That becomes a weight that one ultimately cannot carry,'' he
said.
   Suzan Harjo, head of the National Congress of American Indians,
said the Smithsonian was setting a precedent bound to influence
museums all over the country, which have the remains of an estimated
600,000 Indians.
   ``There is no doubt about it _ the Smithsonian is king of the
hill when it comes to setting policy,'' she said.
   The Smithsonian has a collection of the bones of approximately
18,000 Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, most of which were unearthed
during archaeological excavations, construction or erosion. About
4,000 remains came from the Army Medical Museum and were transferred
to the Smithsonian at the turn of the century. Many of those were
the result of grave-robbing.
   Indian groups have sought the return of the remains for several
years on religious grounds. But Adams had said the Smithsonian would
return only those that could be identified as stolen from graves or
traced to living descendants. In the last 18 months, only the
remains of 18 Blackfeet were returned, according to Adams.
   Inouye and Campbell are sponsoring bills to establish a National
Museum of the American Indian in Washington. The museum would be
created when the collection of the Museum of the American Indian in
New York City is transferred to the Smithsonian. The shift can't
take place without legislation providing funds and giving the
Smithsonian authority to build.
   The Smithsonian said last week it would keep a museum at the
current site in upper Manhattan in addition to building a Washington
museum. The New York museum's collection is the world's largest
collection of Indian artifacts.
