   Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, objected Friday to parts of proposed
legislation concerning the building here of a National Museum of
the American Indian, complaining mainly about a provision involving
consultations on remains.
   ``While we are heartened by many provisions of the proposed
bill, we must register objections to others,'' Adams said in
testimony prepared for a joint hearing of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs and the Rules Committee.
   ``Primary among these is the requirement that the (Smithsonian)
Board of Regents consult with the board of trustees of the new
museum on the matter of skeletal remains.''
   On Monday, Adams signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Museum of the American Indian in New York City to transfer the
world's largest collection of American Indian artifacts to the
Smithsonian.
   The museum would display objects from the Heye Foundation
collection of more than a million artifacts.
   The Smithsonian already has Indian artifacts, including some
34,000 skeletal specimens, almost all of which were acquired
through archaelogical excavations or salvage operations.
   Approximately 14,500 of the remains are North American Indians,
and some tribes have sought return of these bones for burial. The
museum has said it would return any bones which tribes could
identify as being those of their ancestors but few tribes have made
claims.
   ``The collections at issue are under the purview of an entirely
separate museum,'' Adams said in testimony Friday. ``While
individual trustees may be consulted in a personal capacity, the
requirement for consultation with the board as a body is not
appropriate.''
   Adams also objected to a requirement in the bill that seven
members of the board of trustees of the new museum must be of
native American ancestry.
   ``Our agreement with the Museum of the American Indian, Heye
Foundation, which must be approved by the courts in New York,
includes no comparable requirement, although it clearly
contemplates that American Indians and Alaska natives will be
members of the board,'' he said in prepared remarks.
