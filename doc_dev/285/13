<HEAD>Campbell Says Officials Working Toward Solution Over Remains</HEAD>

   The Smithsonian Institution failed to reach
agreement with Indian leaders on the return of Indian skeletal
remains to tribes for burial, but officials said they laid the
groundwork for a settlement.
   ``I think we're going to be able to make some progress,'' Rep.
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., said Sunday by telephone from his
Ignacio, Colo., ranch.
   ``We have a gentlemen's agreement to find a solution. We've
agreed on the direction of the talks, but we don't have any firm
language,'' he said.
   Campbell said he met Thursday in Albuquerque with Smithsonian
Secretary Robert McCormick Adams, Suzan Harjo, executive director of
the National Congress of American Indians, and Walter Echo-Hawk, a
lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund, to listen in on
negotiations.
   ``I think generally the agreement we're looking for is that if we
can positively identify the remains as belonging to a tribal group
or family, or if we can locate where the remains were taken from,
then the Smithsonian would be willing to return those,'' Campbell
said.
   Many of the remains are untraceable, however, he said.
   Leslie Logan of the Smithsonian's Office of Public Affairs said
one of the sticking points is whether the institution will return
remains that were taken from certain locations but can't be traced
to a particular family or tribal group.
   The Smithsonian has an estimated 35,000 Indian skeletons and
other sacred objects, and they have long been the source of
bitterness among American Indians who liken anthropologists and
other collectors to grave robbers.
   Officials had hoped to announce an agreement on the remains
Saturday night during a reception at the Wheelwright Museum of the
American Indian in Santa Fe.
   Campbell and Ms. Logan said officials would continue to meet
during the next several weeks.
   The National Congress of American Indians estimates the bones of
2.5 million Indians are held in public and private collections
nationwide, although museum spokesmen estimate the number is closer
to 250,000.
   Campbell said he hopes an agreement with the Smithsonian will
convince other museums and universities to return some remains from
their collections.
   Ms. Logan said the Smithsonian has agreed to negotiate in part
because it is looking for support for its plans to build a national
museum for the American Indian in Washington, D.C.
   If approved by Congress, construction on the $175 million museum
would begin in 1992.
   Meanwhile, a sacred pole topped with a human scalp and said to
symbolize tribal unity was presented to the Omaha Tribe in Macy,
Neb., on Sunday after being held 101 years in a Boston museum.
   The pole, believed to more than 300 years old, was entrusted to
the Peabody Museum at Harvard University by its last keeper, Yellow
Smoke, because he doubted younger generations of Omahas would
cherish it. Tribal officials recently negotiated its return.
   ``It will take up where it left off in 1888,'' Tribal Chairman
Doran Morris said last month. ``It is a central part of our lives.
It will influence our children and grandchildren.''
