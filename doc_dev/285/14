   Congress is within arm's length of
establishing a National Museum of the American Indian in the
nation's capital, and in the process, settling some longstanding
feuds.
   The Senate was expected to take up a bill today to transfer a
priceless collection of Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of
the American Indian to the Smithsonian Institution, which would
display them in a national museum on the Mall and a satellite
facility in New York City.
   The House passed the measure by voice vote Monday.
   A similar bill passed the Senate on Oct. 3, but because of
slight differences in the two bills' language, Sen. Daniel K.
Inouye, D-Hawaii, planned to ask the Senate to approve the House
version today, said Pat Zell, a spokeswoman for the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, which Inouye chairs.
   The measure may at long last make peace among diverse factions,
first by resolving a 10-year-old dispute in New York over how to
display and preserve the Heye Foundation collection of more than 1
million Indian artifacts.
   Second, it stipulates that the Smithsonian, where possible,
return some 18,000 Indian remains to their original tribes for
burial.
   The question of the remains had been the last obstacle to
crafting a passable bill, and compromise came in September when
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams reversed the museum's
long-held policy that the bones were necessary for study.
   Indians nationwide, seeking to bury their ancestors, heralded
his decision as a watershed that will influence other museums.
   Adams called Monday's House action ``a wonderful moment.''
   ``It opens new horizons for the Smithsonian and the world,'' he
said in a statement. ``We'll be working with Native American
communities in ways we've never done before, and it's a model for
working with other communities.''
