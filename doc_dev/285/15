   The ancestors of American Indians will ``at
last find their final resting place'' under a plan by the
Smithsonian Institution to return Indian remains to their tribes for
burial, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs said Tuesday.
   The agreement, which reverses a long-standing museum policy that
made return of Indian remains rare, was added Tuesday to a bill
before the House that will establish a National Museum of the
American Indian in Washington.
   ``There are many people in this nation who predicted not too long
ago that this day would never come,'' said the chairman, Sen. Daniel
K. Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   ``Today, a process has started that will allow the ancestors of
native Americans to at last find their final resting place,'' he
added. ``It's a day that will be celebrated by Indian leaders
throughout Indian country.''
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., an American Indian
instrumental in achieving the compromise with the museum, said,
``Those remains that can be identified, either specifically or by
the name of tribe, the Smithsonian will notify the individuals in
the tribe and the tribe will be able to have them returned to them.''
   Under the agreement announced at a news conference, the
Smithsonian will form a five-person commission, including native
Americans, to inventory and identify its collection of remains and
funerary objects _ ceremonial items buried with the Indians.
   The legislation authorizes about $2.25 million for the process:
$1 million directly to the Smithsonian, $1 million to the tribes,
and the remainder for operating costs.
   The agreement represents a significant change of thinking by the
administration of the Smithsonian, which previously had said the
bones were necessary for scientific study.
   ``It seems to me that as the head of the Smithsonian, I certainly
have an obligation to try to retain what can be retained of our
scientific collections,'' Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams
said at the news conference. ``At the same time, it's obiviously
incumbent on me ... to respect and try and alleviate the trauma of
American Indians.''
   Suzan Shown Harjo, executive director of the National Congress of
American Indians, said the Smithsonian was setting a precedent bound
to influence museums all over the country, which have an estimated
600,000 Indian remains.
   Identifying and returning the bones will probably take ``years
and years'' Adams said, and many may not be identifiable.
   The Smithsonian's collection comprises the bones of approximately
18,000 Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, many of which were unearthed
during archaeological excavations, construction or erosion. The
museum also has some 17,000 funerary objects.
   Indian groups have sought the return of the remains for several
years on religious grounds. But Adams had said the Smithsonian would
return only those that could be identified as stolen from graves or
traced to living descendants. As a result, only 18 Blackfoot remains
have been returned in the last year and a half, according to Adams.
