   It's official: The Smithsonian Institution
will build a National Museum of the American Indian as the newest
attraction on the Mall.
   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday night clearing the way
for officials to start designing the museum, which will draw most
of its artwork and artifacts from a world-famed collection in New
York City.
   The measure also outlines the policy for returning American
Indian and native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects to
the tribes and organizations for burial. It requires the
Smithsonian to inventory all human remains in its collections.
   Bush expressed ``great pleasure'' in signing the legislation,
the result of a political compromise after New York lawmakers
fought to keep the Indian museum in New York.
   The heart of the museum's collection will come from the Museum
of the American Indian, run by the Heye Foundation in New York City.
   The compromise includes the opening of a $25 million satellite
facility in the old U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan, which
will be called the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum
of the American Indian.
   The Smithsonian will build the $106 million museum on the Mall
between the Air and Space Museum and the Botanical Gardens _ near
the foot of Capitol Hill _ and build a $44 million storage and
conservation center in Suitland, Md., for the Indian artifacts.
   ``From this point, our nation will go forward with a new and
richer understanding of the heritage, culture and values of the
peoples of the Americas of Indian ancestry,'' Bush said.
   The Heye Foundation's collection is considered priceless, but
the museum in New York has not attracted the crowds _ or the
financial backing _ that the Smithsonian museums in the nation's
capital garner.
   Indian tribal leaders and native Hawaiian groups for years have
demanded the return of human remains kept in museum collections.
   Bush said the Smithsonian ``will attempt to identify the origins
of such remains and objects and will notify the appropriate tribes
and organizations of its findings.''
   The ultimate plan, he said, is for ``repatriation'' of the
remains.
   ``This has been a difficult and complex issue to address,
involving traditional values of American Indian people, the medial
and scientific research value of the remains and objects and the
trust responsibilities of the Smithsonian,'' Bush said.
   The law authorizes $10 million in planning and design
expenditures for fiscal 1990, which began two months ago. The
Department of the Interior's 1990 appropriation includes $5.5
million in actual funds to start the work.
   The federal government will split the cost of revamping the
Customs House in Manhattan with New York City and New York state.
