<HEAD>Two Indian Museums Would Cost More than $150 Million, Officials Say</HEAD>

   Building a new Indian museum in Washington and
moving the existing one in New York City will cost more than $100
million, not to mention annual operating costs of about $25 million
a year, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution told a
congressional panel.
   ``We are in the process of developing detailed cost estimates for
this undertaking but recognize already that they will not be
inconsequential,'' Secretary Robert Adams told the House Interior
Committee.
   Adams appeared with representatives of the Museum of the American
Indian and the city and state of New York to detail a tentative
agreement reached in January transferring ownership of the Heye
Foundation's collection of Indian artifacts to the Smithsonian.
   The pact, which must be approved by the Smithsonian's executive
board and New York state courts, would solve the problem of
preserving the collection of 1 million artifacts, a fraction of
which are on display in the New York museum. Most are stored in a
Bronx warehouse.
   Adams also estimated one-time costs ``in the tens of millions of
dollars'' for taking over the collection of the Museum of the
American Indian and building additional storage space at the
Smithsonian's Museum Support Center in Suitland, Md.
   ``These costs, of course, must be weighed in the light of an
extraordinary opportunity _ indeed, an obligation _ to preserve a
collection of monumental significance, make it more accessible to
the public than it ever has been, and to share it fully with those
whose ancestors created the obejcts within it,'' Adams said.
