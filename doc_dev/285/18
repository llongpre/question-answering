American Indian Museum: The Senate unanimously approved legislation Tuesday 
authorizing the Smithsonian Institution to establish a National Museum of the 
American Indian in Washington. The bill transfers a priceless collection of 
Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of the American Indian to the 
Smithsonian for display in a national museum on the Mall and in a satellite 
institution in New York City. Approval came on a voice vote, sending the bill 
to the White House for the President's signature. The House passed it on 
Monday. The measure may make peace among diverse factions, first by resolving a 
10-year-old dispute in New York over how to display and preserve the Heye 
Foundation collection of more than 1 million Indian artifacts. Secondly, it 
stipulates that the Smithsonian, where possible, return some 18,000 Indian 
remains to their original tribes for burial. ALEENE MacMINN
