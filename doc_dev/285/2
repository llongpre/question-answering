<HEAD>Draft Agreement Would Transfer Indian Artifact Collection to Smithsonian</HEAD>

   A draft agreement has been reached to transfer
title to the nation's largest collection of Indian artifacts from
New York's Museum of the American Indian to the Smithsonian
Institution, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   ``The plan is still being negotiated and there's nothing that's
signed,'' said Madeleine Jacobs, spokeswoman for the Smithsonian.
   Essentially, the agreement would transfer title of the Heye
Collection to the Smithsonian, but the Smithsonian would be
obligated to maintain a satellite museum of ``significant'' size in
New York, Jacobs said.
   This would legally fulfill terms of the trust which established
New York's Museum of the American Indian 73 years ago and which
requires the collection to be in New York.
   Under the draft agreement, most of the collection would be housed
in a new national museum of the American Indian to be built by the
Smithsonian on the Mall in Washington.
   The New York museum could be located in the old U.S. Custom House
in lower Manhattan, as has been previously suggested, but ``that's
one of the things that's open to negotiation at this point,'' Jacobs
said.
   The draft is to be presented to the Smithsonian's regents next
week. The Museum of the American Indian had not signed the
memorandum either, Jacobs said.
   The latest proposal emerged after years of debating how best to
preserve and exhibit the more than 1 million artifacts comprising
the collection of the late George Gustav Heye. The current Museum of
the American Indian, in upper Manhattan, is only big enough to
display about 1 percent of the collection.
   In addition, it is located in a decaying neighborhood which
attracts few casual visitors. The rest of the collection has been
moldering in a four-story warehouse in the Bronx.
   Various plans had been raised for several years to move the
collection, which at one point appeared on the verge of going to
Dallas. But New York City officials intervened, pointing out that
the Heye trust requires that it remain in New York.
   Last April, Smithsonian officials rejected a proposal to break
the collection into three parts, with one moving to the Mall, one
remaining at the old Manhattan site and another moving into the old
U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan. The Smithsonian's key
objection to the earlier plan was that it did not want only to have
borrowing privileges.
