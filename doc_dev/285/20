Officials of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Museum of the 
American Indian in New York signed an agreement to transfer the world's largest 
collection of American Indian artifacts to the Smithsonian. The museum 
agreement capped years of often-acrimonious negotiations among federal, state 
and local politicians, officials of the Smithsonian and the Indian museum, and 
American Indians. Besides the building of the National Museum of the American 
Indian in Washington, the agreement also calls for moving the existing Indian 
museum to larger quarters in the old U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, where part 
of the Heye Foundation collection will be exhibited.
