<LEADPARA>  The Smithsonian Institution promised Tuesday to honor legitimate claims by
American Indians for the return of their ancestors' skeletal remains and
cultural artifacts held by the proposed new National Museum of the American
Indian.;    Robert Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian, said the repatriation
policy implements a provision in the 1989 law establishing the new museum that
makes clear that "human interest in one's ancestors is paramount" over the
interests of scientific research.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new plan "will support and undergird the cultural renaissance that is
flowering in Indian America," said museum director W. Richard West Jr., an
Albuquerque, N.M., lawyer and member of the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribes of
Oklahoma.;    Museum inventory;    Under the policy, approved Monday by the
museum's board of trustees, the museum staff will prepare an inventory
identifying the origins of human remains, funeral objects, communal Indian
property, ceremonial or religious objects and other materials in their
collection.;    The inventory will be furnished to all appropriate American
Indian tribes and native Hawaiian organizations as quickly as possible.;   
Officials said the museum will be obligated to honor claims submitted by those
who can prove they are descendants or "can demonstrate a cultural affiliation"
to the materials, some of which were confiscated during the 19th century
Indian wars.;    Under the law, a cultural affiliation means "a relationship
of shared group identity" that can be traced historically from a contemporary
Indian tribe to an earlier -- even prehistoric -- Indian group.;    $106
million price tag;    The new Smithsonian museum will cost an estimated $106
million -- one-third to be raised privately -- and will be situated on the
National Mall just east of the National Air and Space Museum. Construction is
expected to begin in the mid-1990s and be completed by the end of the decade.;
   The museum's initial collection will consist of more than 1 million Indian
objects transferred to the Smithsonian from the Museum of the American Indian,
Heye Foundation, in New York, under an agreement concluded last year after
long negotiations.  </TEXT>
