   A member of the Cheyenne-Araphoe tribes has
been named founding director of the National Museum of the American
Indian, the Smithsonian Institution said Monday.
   W. Richard West Jr., an Albuquerque, N.M., lawyer, was chosen by
a search committee that began work in January, Smithsonian
Secretary Robert McC. Adams said at a news conference.
   The museum will be built in the last remaining space on the
Washington Mall, between the National Air and Space Museum and the
U.S. Capitol. Ground is expected to be broken in 1994.
   ``My highest aspiration for the National Museum of the American
Indian is that it will re-analyze, redirect and, in many cases,
reformulate entirely the concepts and presentations of the past
concerning Indian culture,'' West said.
   West, a partner in the Indian-owned law firm of Gover, Steton,
Williams &amp; West, has worked with the Native American Council of
Regents of the Institute of American Indian Arts. He is the son of
Indian artist Walter Richard West Sr.
   West, 47, said he would resign from the law firm. His
appointment is effective June 1 at a yearly salary of $115,000.
