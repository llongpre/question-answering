   A new plan has emerged after years of debate to
move the bulk of the nation's largest collection of Indian artifacts
from New York City to Washington, D.C., a newspaper reported today.
   The Museum of the American Indian would relocate from its
Manhattan site to the Mall in Washington, The New York Times
reported. The Smithsonian Institution would build and operate that
museum, as well as a smaller Indian museum in New York.
   Although the collection is considered the finest of its kind, it
has been virtually invisible in its current location in upper
Manhattan, far from the usual tourist areas.
   The museum is only able to display about 1 percent of the
collection, and the rest is stored in a four-story warehouse in the
Bronx. There has been increasing concern that the collection could
be deteriorating.
   Various plans had been raised for several years to move the
collection, which at one point appeared on the verge of being moved
to Dallas. But New York City officials intervened, pointing out that
a trust established for the museum 73 years ago requires that it
remain in New York.
   Last April, Smithsonian officials rejected a proposal to break
the collection into three parts, with one moving to the Mall, one
remaining at the old Manhattan site and another moving into the old
U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan.
   The newest plan would move a portion to the Custom House,
satisfying the terms of the trust and increasing the museum's
visibility in New York.
   Mary Ellen Burns, an assistant attorney general in New York City,
said the state had made a major concession in agreeing to give the
Smithsonian full title to the collection.
   The attorney general's office is charged with overseeing trusts.
   The Times said the state has insisted that the customs house be
used to display the collection in New York.
   Burns said the city and the Heye Foundation, which runs the
existing museum, agree with the general provisions of the new
proposal.
   The newspaper said approval of the new proposal hinges on
Congress, which must approve funds for a new museum.
