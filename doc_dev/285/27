   American Indian groups and the Smithsonian Institution said they agreed on a policy to return more of the 19,000 Indian remains stored at the museum to tribal descendants. 

   Remains will be returned where historical and scientific evidence indicates that they belong to a specific tribe. 
Previously, the Smithsonian usually repatriated remains only to direct descendants. 
Since less than two dozen Smithsonian remains are identified by name, such repatriations have been rare. 

   Smithsonian officials said hundreds of the remains could be affected by the new policy. 
The collection was gathered by archaeologists, private collectors and U.S. soldiers during the Indian Wars. 
In recent years, American Indian groups have pressured museums to take such remains off display and return them. 

   The agreement will be added as an amendment to bills introduced in the House and Senate for the creation of an American Indian museum in Washington, D.C. 
It won't affect an estimated 200,000 Indian remains held by state and private museums, but Indian leaders said they hoped other institutions would follow the Smithsonian's lead.
