<LEADPARA>  ABOUT 14,000 mosquitoes, 8,000 threadworms, Barbara Bush's gown from the 1989
inaugural, samples of woolly mammoth hair.;    That's what's new at the
Smithsonian Institution. And it doesn't scratch the surface of the 1990 list
of acquisitions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Among the nearly 2 million items the Smithsonian added to its collections
last year: 30 live Arboreal Day geckos from Madagascar; a 16th-century Chinese
scroll called "Leaping Carp"; a 19th-century throne of the HeHe people of
Tanzania carved in the form of a female torso; a clarinet owned by Benny
Goodman; and Bruce Larson's 4,000-horsepower Oldsmobile Cutlass "funny car,"
which won the National Hot Rod Association's World Championship in 1989.;   
Some of those items sound funny, but the collections are serious business.
Curators for the Smithsonian Institution -- 16 museums and galleries (plus the
National Zoo) in Washington, D.C. -- are always trying to fill gaps in the
collections with items of artistic, historic or scientific interest.;   
William Withuhn, curator of transportation in the American History Museum,
says the museum is trying to get some choice race cars from just before and
after World War II, as well as trying to keep up with the latest technology in
electric and solar cars.;    Although 1990 marked the end of a decade, the
acquisitions don't represent any special effort to round out the period, says
John Barrat, a spokesman for the Smithsonian, the world's largest complex of
museums.;    "Election years are among the most important because of all the
election paraphernalia," he says.;    The list of 1990 acquisitions includes
items that are significant for widely different reasons.;    A treasured
addition this year is a collection of more than 1 million artifacts from the
Museum of the American Indian in New York City. The carvings, masks, dolls,
baskets, jewelry and other items will form the foundation of the Smithsonian's
American Indian museum, which is to open by the turn of the century.;    The
aforementioned 14,000 neo-tropical mosquitoes, all mounted and identified,
will be used to study mosquito-transmitted diseases. They and the threadworms,
along with the samples of woolly mammoth hair and intestinal contents (we can
thank the Soviet Union for the latter) go into the Museum of Natural History.;
   In the Air and Space Museum are two nuclear missiles -- a Soviet SS20 and a
U.S. Pershing II, both banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty. They stand side by side -- defused.;    Many of the items are donated;
others are bought. The Smithsonian displays relatively few of its 139 million
or so items. Some are studied by scholars; some are loaned to other museums.  </TEXT>
