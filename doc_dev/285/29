   President Bush met Tuesday with four
Republican members of Congress who support abortion rights, but his
spokesman said his own anti-abortion views ``are not subject to
change.''
   The president met with Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois, Claudine
Schneider of Rhode Island, Nancy Johnson of Connecticut and Olympia
Snowe of Maine.
   Bush also plans to speak at fund-raising event next Monday for
both Martin and Schneider.
   ``Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one's
position is,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The president supports all Republicans,'' Fitzwater said. ``He
supports Republican candidates without regard to specific positions
that differ from him.''
   Afterward, Snowe said she and the other participants expressed
their views but gained no commitment from Bush.
   Snowe said the Republicans did not expect Bush to reverse
himself on abortion, but hoped ``there could be some gradations in
his position'' in the future _ such as allowing federally funded
abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest.
   ``We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about thhe more
than one
million items are displayed at the Museum of the American Indian in
upper Manhattan, N.Y.. The bulk of the collection is stored in a
Bronx, N.Y., warehouse.
   Roland Force, director of the Museum of the American Indian,
called the vote ``something we can all rejoice in.''
   ``It's important to Indians, it's important to the Smithsonian,
and it's important to this nation, and how can you do anything
better than that?'' he said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., the bill's House sponsor,
said he hoped groundbreaking in Washington could occur by 1992, a
date he called meaningful because it would be the 500th anniversary
of Columbus' landfall in the New World.
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs agreed that date was
realistic.
   Campbell also said President Bush would sign the bill Monday or
Tuesday at a ceremony on the new museum's site, between the
National Air and Space Museum and the Capitol.
   The legislation transfers the Heye collection to the
Smithsonian, which already has a significant collection of Indian
artifacts. It authorizes $10 million in 1990 for the planning,
design and construction of the national museum, and for the care
and custody of the Heye collection.
   It also mandates that the Smithsonian establish a satellite
Indian museum in the old Custom House in lower Manhattan and build
storage space for the artifacts at its museum support center in
Suitland, Md.
   The costs of building the new museum and the two other
facilities have been estimated at $175 million.
   Converting the Custom House is expected to cost $24 million,
with New York City and New York state to pay one-third each.
   In addition, the legislation stipulates that the Smithsonian,
where possible, return its collection of some 18,000 Indian remains
and funerary objects to their original tribes for burial. The
legislation authorizes more than $1.2 million in 1991 for the
Smithsonian to inventory and repatriate the remains.
   Disposition of the remains had been the last obstacle to a
successful bill. Compromise came in September, when Smithsonian
Secretary Robert McCormick Adams _ himself an anthropologist _
reversed the museum's long-held policy that the bones were
necessary for study. Indians nationwide, seeking to bury their
ancestors, heralded his decision as a watershed that will influence
other museums.
