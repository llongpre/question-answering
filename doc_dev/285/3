   The secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
has signed a pact to open a National Museum for the American Indian
here, but legislation is needed to provide the funds to pay for it.
   Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams on Monday signed an
agreement to take title to New York City's Heye Foundation
collection, the world's premier collection of American Indian
artifacts.
   ``I don't think there ever will have been a museum quite like
the one we foresee, with great confidence, going up on the site
behind me,'' Adams said at the signing ceremony.
   Roland Force, director of the New York-based Museum of the
American Indian that currently houses the collection, presented
Adams with a peace pipe-tomahawk given to Tecumseh, the Shawnee
chief, by Col. Henry A. Proctor of the British Army in 1812.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, pledged to introduce a bill this week
to begin efforts to secure the money.
   The Smithsonian would build the museum in the last available
space on the Mall, between the Air and Space Museum and the
Capitol. It also agreed to construct additional storage space for
the collection in Suitland, Md.
   In addition to transferring the bulk of the Heye Foundation
collection to Washington, the accord calls for moving the Museum of
the American Indian from its cramped location in New York City to a
larger federally owned building there. The facility would be
renamed the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the
American Indian and display a small portion of the 1 million-piece
collection.
   Adams estimated it would take six years before the Washington
museum's doors open. In addition to securing financing, the plan
must be approved by New York state courts.
   Earlier this year, Adams estimated the project would cost more
than $150 million.
