<LEADPARA>  THE Smithsonian Institution's board of regents has unanimously approved the
establishment of a National African-American Museum. The museum would be on
the capital Mall and administered by the Smithsonian Institution.;    In
making the announcement on Monday, Robert McC. Adams, the Smithsonian's
secretary, said the institution is setting forth not on a course of
"separatism" but rather toward the creation of a "distinct facility that takes
acknowledgment of a distinct cultural achievement."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The regents endorsed the findings of an advisory committee that had been
studying the matter for a year. The study was under the direction of Claudine
Brown, former assistant director for government and community relations at the
Brooklyn Museum in New York. Eighteen months ago, Adams appointed her to
explore "the form and content of an African-American presence on the Mall.";  
 A number of black Americans who say they see a lack of black perspective and
participation in museums across the country have been lobbying for such an
institution for a number of years. Legislation calling for a National Museum
of African-American Heritage had been introduced in the House by Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., and in the Senate by Paul Simon, D-Ill.;    The 22-member
advisory committee, headed by Mary Schmidt Campbell, New York city
commissioner for cultural affairs, proposes that the museum, which could open
by 1995, be established in the Arts and Industries Building, next to the
Smithsonian's Castle on Jefferson Drive.;    The Arts and Industries building,
which has 32,000 square feet of exhibition space, is the current home of the
1876 Centennial exhibition, which will probably be dismantled or stored.;   
The first task, Brown said, will be the development of a core collection that
will come from private collectors.;    Collecting and research is to initially
concentrate on four areas: images of black Americans in print and
broadcasting; material documenting black history, specifically in the civil
rights and labor movements; art and artifacts documenting the experiences of
Africans in the diaspora; and the work of black artists.;    The museum, Brown
said, will also develop collaborative educational programs with cultural and
educational organizations in the United States and around the world.;    The
committee report proposed that the museum be governed by a 19-member board of
trustees, with 10 members of African descent. Adams said he did not yet know
how much the museum would cost.  </TEXT>
