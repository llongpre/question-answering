   Leaders of an American Indian coalition
say they're haunted by the image of their ancestors' remains stored
in boxes in museums and universities. They want them returned for
burial.
   ``We're asking that they bring them back to their lands, their
natural resting place. That's what they deserve,'' says Delfino
Begay, governor of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.
   The National Congress of American Indians, meeting in Albuquerque
this week, estimates the bones of 2.5 million Indians are held in
public and private collections nationwide. Museum spokesmen dispute
the figure, estimating institutions hold the remains of 100,000 to
250,000.
   One of the largest collections is at the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, D.C., which says it has 18,600 such remains, stacked
in boxes in a hallway closed to the public.
   The Smithsonian, along with a number of other museums and
universities, is studying the bones to learn more about the bone
structure, diseases and lifestyles of American Indians of more than
a century ago.
   The Indian leaders, representing about 20 tribes at conference,
want the remains returned now, or at the very least, when the
studies are completed.
   Some say they have nightmares about the unburied dead.
   ``You really don't get the feeling of the Smithsonian ... until
you get there and see the boxes upon boxes in the hallway,'' said
Lawrence Kenmill, a member of the Salish-Kootenay Tribal Council
from Pablo, Mont.
   ``You get all kinds of feelings put together. You're sad, you're
hurt, you're angry. You get them all at once when you're looking at
it.''
   The delegates agreed the situation has improved in the past 10
years, with new laws protecting disposition of newly unearthed
remains. Some institutions also have returned bones.
   Last week, for instance, about 1,200 pounds of prehistoric
remains of members of the Seminole Tribe were reburied at Wounded
Knee, S.D., after being stored at the University of South Dakota for
the past three years.
   The remains had been unearthed at a construction site near Tampa,
Fla. Their new gravesite will become part of the National Indian
Cemetery.
   The Smithsonian also recently returned remains of 16 Blackfeet
that were improperly taken from a Blackfeet cemetery, and the
University of Tennessee repatriated 190 Cherokee remains exhumed in
1967.
   But the Indian leaders point out the returned remains are a small
fraction of what is being held. They are particularly concerned with
older bones, including skulls taken for cranial studies by the U.S.
Army Medical Corps during the Civil War and wars with Indians.
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said comparative studies
are still being done on the skulls. She also said the Smithsonian
was evaluating its policy of holding onto the remains.
   ``Our goal is to come to an accommodation with them,'' she said
of discussions with Indian groups. ``I think we all feel there is a
solution.'' Other large collections are at the Field Museum in
Chicago, the Peabody at Harvard University, the University of
California and the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
   Researchers say they are reluctant to relinquish the remains
because of recent breakthroughs.
   Harold Voris, the Field's vice president of collections and
research, said DNA fingerprinting has revealed a wealth of
information from the bones.
   ``It may help find the kinds of illness people were prone to,''
he said. Ms. Jacobs said researchers have learned that rheumatoid
arthritis is more prevalent in Indians than in the general
population.
   And Dr. Jefferson Chapman, curator of archaeology at the McClung
Museum in Knoxville, Tenn., said the University of Tennessee's 5,500
remains are now being used for research of spina bifida, a defect
characterized by imperfect closure of part of the spine.
   ``There are so many new things coming out, and who knows what
else will come along,'' Chapman said.
