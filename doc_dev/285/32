   The gaily painted carousel on the National
Mall is still taking tourists on a gentle musical swing through
yesteryear, but officials at the Smithsonian Institution's nearby
headquarters are bracing for a bumpy financial ride into the future.
   Anticipating a new era of austerity after a quarter-century of
extraordinary expansion, the Smithsonian is delaying the start of
several major construction and renovation projects and searching
for ways to trim its costly payroll of 6,600 employees.
   At the moment, Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian,
is gratified that a House subcommittee recently voted to boost his
federal appropriation next year by nearly 18 percent, from $267
million to $313 million, even more than he had requested.
   Nevertheless, Adams is worried about ominous portents of a
long-term budget squeeze, including economic disruptions from the
Persian Gulf crisis and the threat of ``almost unbelievably
devastating'' automatic spending cuts in mid-October under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   ``The Smithsonian has been generously treated for a very long
time,'' Adams said recently. ``But I think it is the case that the
numbers are large enough now that we cannot expect them to continue
as they have in the past.''
   ``We have to face the fact that we are likely to grow more
slowly in the years ahead,'' he said in a telephone interview from
his vacation home in Basalt, Colo.
   An early casualty of the impending budget crunch was
Undersecretary Dean W. Anderson, who resigned in late July as
Adams' day-to-day overseer of the sprawling Smithsonian complex of
14 museums and galleries, plus the National Zoo.
   After 17 boom years at the Smithsonian, Anderson made clear he
had little stomach for presiding over personnel and program
cutbacks in future years of retrenchment and streamlining of
managerial staff.
   Anderson's resignation resulted in scare headlines suggesting
that the Smithsonian had plunged into a severe financial crisis.
Adams wrote a letter to the editor of The Washington Post
complaining that the press reports ``may leave the public with the
erroneous impression that the Smithsonian is about to close its
doors.''
   The Smithsonian is still very much in business, but the growing
budgetary pinch that it shares with other federal agencies may be
more visible at the Smithsonian's vast cultural and scientific
enterprises, which attracted 24.2 million visitors last year.
   The National Museum of Natural History, for example, has more
than 50 staff vacancies, leaving gaps in the museum's far-flung
research activities and threatening to delay curatorial work for
future exhibitions.
   In April, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden temporarily
closed an entire floor of its galleries of modern art because it
couldn't afford to pay the guards. The National Museum of American
History has abandoned its school programs, bilingual activities and
its plans to bolster hiring of minority staffers.
   The Smithsonian receives virtually no federal money to mount
major exhibitions, even though 84 percent of its current $353
million budget comes from congressional appropriations and the rest
from various trust funds, gifts and profit-making ventures.
   As a result, American History was forced to rely on computer and
telecommunications industry donors to finance its ambitious
``Information Age'' show which opened in May, raising questions
about corporate influence over exhibition content.
   The National Air and Space Museum desperately needs additional
storage space, but Adams says construction of a planned $330
million museum extension at Dulles International Airport may be in
jeopardy if budget cuts require postponement of building plans.
   At the National Zoo, Director Michael Robinson said ``additional
budget cuts could have grave consequences'' by forcing the zoo to
suspend modernization projects and curtail education, conservation
and research activities.
   Adams said his major priorities are to build a $175 million
National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall _ the
Smithsonian's 15th museum _ and decide what form an
African-American ``presence'' should take in Washington.
   He also is determined to expand cultural diversity at the
Smithsonian, with greater focus on minority interests, and pursue
research and education on protecting the environment.
   Last week, the White House budget office told the Smithsonian to
begin preparing for a 32 percent spending cut if budget negotiators
fail to meet Gramm-Rudman's deficit reduction target by the Oct. 1
start of the fiscal year.
   To compensate for a projected loss of $77 million in federal
funds next year, Adams envisioned cancellation of museum programs,
drastically shorter museum hours and widespread job layoffs.
