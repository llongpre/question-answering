   A collection of the personal scrapbooks, tape
recordings, published and unpublished sheet music of Edward Kennedy
``Duke'' Ellington was presented to the Smithsonian Institution on
Tuesday by the son of the late composer-orchestra leader.
   ``We've come to perpetuate Ellington as a composer,'' Mercer
Ellington said. ``Personally, it gives me the satisfaction of
knowing we have located Ellington in a place of posterity.
   ``We will come to see him take his place among the other great
composers of note, such as Debussy,'' Ellington said. ``There is
also the fact that a black American was able to achieve this
without having to go anyplace else. He got it at home.''
   Acquisition of the 6,000-item collection followed three years of
negotiations with the Ellington estate and a special congressional
appropriation of $500,000, said Roger G. Kennedy, director of the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. The collection
will be housed in the jazz section of the museum's division of
musical history.
   He said about half the funds would be used to preserve the older
manuscripts, some still stored in brown cardboard boxes.
   The Smithsonian also plans to sponser performances of
Ellington's previously unknown works and issue an unspecified
number of publications featuring articles from the collection.
   ``We have produced many good songwriters in this country,'' said
Martin Williams, cultural historian of the Smithsonian Institution
Press. ``But he was much more than that _ he was a
composer-orchestrator.
   ``It is on those accomplishments that he receives the respect
that he has ... as a major figure in 20th century music,'' Williams
said.
   The author of several Smithsonian jazz books, Williams said the
collection offers ``Ellingtonologists'' the opportunity to examine
the original sheet music of the Duke's classics, including ``Satin
Doll,'' ``Mood Indigo'' and ``Caravan.'' All other sheet music of
Ellington's works had been transcribed from old recordings and
tapes, he said.
   ``To Pop the best song was the one he was writing at the time,''
Ellington said, noting that his father had written some rock 'n'
roll songs from his rhythm and blues times.
   Ellington also told of the time when his father put together a
be-bop group called The Spacemen. ``He never excluded himself from
any generation.''
