<LEADPARA>  A group of native Hawaiian families will receive the last of their ancestors'
bones today at the Smithsonian Institution, which rejected the rival claim of
two purported royal priests who threatened vengeance if they were not awarded
the remains.;    After a private religious ceremony at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of Natural History, the officially recognized delegation will
carry away the 135 skeletal remains in woven ti leaf baskets for burial on the
island of Kauai.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Museum director Frank Talbot rejected a competing claim for the bones by Ed
Kaiwi of Kauai and his cousin, Eric Kanakaole of Maui, who appeared at the
museum last week purporting to be kahunas, or priests descended from Hawaiian
royalty.;    The tattooed men, who wore sarongs and braided leaf necklaces and
carried a carved staff representing the Hawaiian god of fertility, threatened
the vengeance of the heavens if the Smithsonian released the bones to anyone
else. "You move the bones, and you all are going to die," Kaiwi said he told
museum officials.;    But Talbot said the pair lacked the status of a
legitimate group, so their claim was not referred to a review board created by
a 1989 federal law to resolve disputes over repatriation of Smithsonian bone
collections.;    The Kauai group designated to receive all 135 bones remaining
in the museum's Hawaiian collection has the blessing of two native Hawaiian
organizations recognized by the 1989 statute. They are the Hui Malama, a
non-profit organization of native Hawaiians, and the state's Office of
Hawaiian Affairs, which represents native Hawaiian interests.;    Talbot said
he also consulted Hawaii's two senators, Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, both
Democrats, before he rejected the competing claim.;    Burial of ancestral
remains is a sensitive issue in Hawaii, where land sacred to natives might be
valuable real estate sought for development.;    The bones removed from the
Smithsonian will be buried on land set aside by a developer on a 12-acre
resort property under construction. Kaiwi and Kanakaole contend that the bones
will be buried in the wrong place.;    The 1989 law creating the Smithsonian's
new National Museum of the American Indian specifies that an inventory of
skeletal remains must be taken, and bones must be returned to any Indian
tribal group that can prove an ancestral claim to them.  </TEXT>
