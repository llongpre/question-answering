The House passed a bill to transfer a priceless collection of more than a 
million Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of the American Indian to the 
Smithsonian Institution for display in Washington and New York. It would create 
a Museum of the American Indian in the last available space on the Washington 
Mall and establish another museum in lower Manhattan. The bill stipulates that 
the Smithsonian, when possible, would return its collection of about 18,000 
Indian remains to their original tribes for burial.
