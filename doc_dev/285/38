   Some of Moscow's most precious art treasures
went on display at the Smithsonian Institution in a major
U.S.-Soviet venture celebrating the rich cultural heritage of the
Soviet capital over the past five centuries.
   The exhibition's more than 200 objects span the creative life of
Moscow from a late 15th century icon portraying the ``Miracle of
St. George and the Dragon'' to modern abstract paintings by Vasily
Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich.
   The show was welcomed Friday to Washington by Robert McC. Adams,
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and Soviet Minister of
Culture Nikolay Gubenko, who called it a ``great event'' in
fostering closer ties between Soviet and American citizens.
   Viewing the exhibit will give Americans a chance to ``feel the
Russian soul'' after centuries of mutual ignorance and
estrangement, said Gubenko, a former movie director and artistic
director of Moscow's Taganka Theater, where he still performs as an
actor on weekends.
   The paintings, sculptures, engravings, religious icons,
porcelains, jewelry, ancient weapons and armor, jeweled masterworks
of gold and silver, historic costumes, maps and other objects were
loaned by the State Kremlin Museums, the State History Museum, the
State Tretyakov Gallery and other collections in Moscow.
   Among them is an altar cross of gold and precious gems made in
the Kremlin workshops in 1562 and presented by Czar Ivan IV -
``Ivan the Terrible'' - to the Solovetsky Monastery in northern
Russia.
   Other objects include a 16th century steel helmet that once
belonged to Ivan's son and heir, and a plate made in 1694 of gold,
emeralds and rubies that was given to young Tsarevich Aleksey, son
of Peter the Great, by his grandmother.
   The exhibition, titled ``Moscow: Treasures and Traditions,''
will appear in the International Gallery of the Smithsonian's S.
Dillon Ripley Center on the National Mall until Feb. 3. This is the
second and final stop for the show, which opened last summer in
Seattle.
   Underwritten by The Boeing Co., the show was organized by the
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service and the Soviet
Ministry of Culture in association with the Seattle Art Museum and
the Seattle organizing committee of the 1990 Goodwill Games.
