<LEADPARA>  A Japanese television network wants to pay the Smithsonian Institution
whatever it costs -- perhaps tens of millions of dollars -- to borrow the
shuttle Enterprise and an assortment of other spacecraft for the company's
planned 40th anniversary celebration in Tokyo in 1993.;    While
representatives of the Nippon Television Network say the deal is 80 percent to
90 percent done, Smithsonian officials say the Japanese company is counting
its spacecraft before they've been launched.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The company says it wants a one-year loan of the space shuttle, an Apollo
capsule, a moon conveyor vehicle, a rocket and a spacesuit -- and one source
with some knowledge of the effort said the Nippon Television Network was
willing to pay up to $30 million. At a congressional hearing earlier this
month, Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., asked Smithsonian officials about "a rumor"
that a deal had been struck to lend the Enterprise for upward of $20 million.;
   Martin Harwit, director of the National Air and Space Museum, said then --
and repeated Friday -- that he simply listened to a proposal from a Japanese
concern but no deal had been made.;    In an interview in Tokyo, Nippon
Television Network consultant Masatake Takahashi and NTV executive Masaru
Maeda said company representatives met with Smithsonian fund-raisers and other
officials five times during the past year about the company's interest.;   
Asked what the company is prepared to pay, Takahashi replied, "What it will
cost.";    Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said that the institution
has talked to the Japanese company only about the Enterprise, and that the
Smithsonian is "not too keen" on the idea. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration also has a voice in the decision, she said, and has its own
reservations.;    For one thing, Jacobs said, the shuttle is difficult to
transport.;    "There are only two ways: on the back of a 747 or by ship," she
said. "In both cases, there are certain risks to the artifact. It is for that
reason that we have always been very reluctant to get involved with moving
that object.";    The Enterprise, a shuttle prototype built in the 1970s that
never flew in space, is stored at Dulles Airport.;    The Smithsonian also has
a general policy on lending national treasures that requires the institution
to give "thorough consideration, incorporating concerns such as the nature of
the object, the impact of its absence on the visiting public and scholars, the
condition of the object, security, legal restrictions . . . and the like.";   
According to Jacobs, Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams would submit any
plan to lend the Enterprise to the board of regents for approval. Adams is
"not prepared to endorse the project," she said.;    While the Smithsonian has
complained about budget constraints in recent months, Jacobs said money is not
"really a factor" in the decision.;    "What is a factor here is the
importance of this artifact to us and to our nation. We are not going to be
swayed by financial considerations," she said.;    Takahashi said he contacted
"about 20" members of Congress before approaching the Smithsonian. Takahashi
did not say whom he consulted, but he said all agreed that they would not
oppose the plan if the company was not profiting from the loan and if the
Nippon Television Network used the space vehicles to bolster the image of the
United States.  </TEXT>
