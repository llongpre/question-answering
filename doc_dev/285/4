   A Smithsonian Institution official met with
Indian leaders this week to discuss the handling of the remains of
Indian ancestors, but no agreement was reached, a Smithsonian
spokeswoman said Saturday.
   Indian leaders want the remains returned to them. Museums and
universities throughout the country argue, however, that the bones
are vital to research.
   Leslie Logan of the Smithsonian's Office of Public Affairs said
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams met Thursday with Rep. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., and Suzan Harjo, executive director of
the National Congress of American Indians, to discuss the issue.
   There was some movement, but not enough to announce a settlement
Saturday as hoped, Logan said.
   During a reception for about 650 people at the Wheelwright Museum
of the American Indian in Santa Fe, Adams announced plans for a
national museum for the American Indian, to be located in Washington.
   If approved, construction on the $175 million museum would begin
in 1992.
   But the issue of returning to tribes some of the 35,000 skeletons
and other sacred objects held by the Smithsonian was not raised
during the reception.
   The issue of the remains was taken up during a meeting this week
in Albuquerque of the National Congress of American Indians.
   The group estimates the bones of 2.5 million Indians are held in
public and private collections nationwide. Museum spokesmen dispute
the figure, estimating institutions hold the remains of 100,000 to
250,000.
   Museums and universities study the bones to learn more about the
bone structure, diseases and lifestyles of American Indians more
than 100 years ago.
   Tribes are pressuring the museums and universities to return the
bones so they can be properly buried.
   Campbell said Indian support for a National Museum of the
American Indian is mixed. He said settling disputes between the
tribes and the Smithsonian over the remains is crucial if the
Smithsonian wants Indians' support.
   ``We have to deal with the bones issue,'' said Campbell, who
sponsored the bill to fund the museum. ``A directive for the
Smithsonian to work with the tribes to settle it is included in the
bill.''
   Adams described the proposed museum as, ``a flagship of American
cultural diversity.''
   ``It is only natural that it should be Indian-led and, hence, it
will have a special sensitivity in its presentation of the spiritual
and symbolic dimension of American Indian history. But the museum is
not a commemoration of the past. It is a celebration bridging the
past, present and future.''
   Herman Agoyo, director of the All Indian Pueblo Council, a
coalition of New Mexico pueblos, said the bill to begin planning _
and to push the Smithsonian to settle the bones issue _ has the
council's full support.
   ``We look forward to actively participating,'' he said. ``For the
first time, we will not be sitting on the outside looking in.''
