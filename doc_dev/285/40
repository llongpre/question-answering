   A chance remark at a Parisian dinner party two
years ago led to the discovery of a long-lost collection of rare
Islamic art that will go on public display Sunday at the Smithsonian
Institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery.
   The collection assembled by Henri Vever, a turn-of-the-century
jeweler and art collector in Paris, is ``perhaps the most important
purchase in the history of the Smithsonian Institution,'' says
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams.
   The 500 items in Vever's collection of richly detailed paintings,
manuscripts, calligraphies and bookbindings from ancient Persia,
India and other major artistic centers of the Near East were bought
for $7 million.
   Smithsonian officials say their real worth is much, much more,
but that the collection is priceless in scope and quality.
   Drawn from the Vever collection are 150 items that will be
displayed at the Sackler, many of them for the first time anywhere,
from Sunday through April 30 in a show titled, ``A Jeweler's Eye:
Islamic Arts of the Book from the Vever Collection.''
   An hour-long ``Smithsonian World'' television special on Vever
and his collection will be broadcast on public TV stations next
March.
   Vever's collection includes almost all of the great classical
Persian texts, several important Arabic works and previously unknown
manuscripts and paintings from major artistic centers of the Near
East and India.
   The art works, some dating to the 11th century, reflect the
reverence for the written word in medieval Islam, stemming from the
holy scriptures of the prophet Muhammad known as the Koran. The
ruling elite built libraries of lavishly illuminated books and
manuscripts as symbols of their cultural sophistication.
   Vever's collection includes brilliant paintings in which the
pigments were ground from minerals, precious stones and metals, an
irresistible attraction to the jeweler and his contemporary, Henri
Cartier.
   Smithsonian officials say the only comparable collection in the
world is housed at the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland.
   Vever's collection disappeared in the late 1930s during the
German occupation of France. Vever himself died in 1942, and the
whereabouts of his collection remained a mystery for nearly half a
century.
   Then, during a small dinner party in Paris in November 1984,
Laure Lowry of Williamstown, Mass., found herself seated next to
Francois Mautin, a wealthy, elderly sportsman and naturalized
American, who casually disclosed a momentous secret.
   Mautin said he was Vever's grandson and had inherited a major
collection of Islamic art, which was shipped intact from France to
New York City after World War II for safekeeping. There it remained,
stored in a vault known only to Mautin.
   Mrs. Lowry telephoned the news to her son, Glenn D. Lowry,
curator of Near Eastern art at the Freer Gallery of Art and the
yet-unbuilt Sackler gallery. Lowry was dumbfounded. He and Milo C.
Beach, now acting director of the Sackler, raced to Paris and won
Mautin's commitment to sell the collection to the Smithsonian.
   Lowry and Beach were the first scholars to see the collection, by
then moved to London, in 50 years. Among the well-preserved items
hidden in trunks and stacked against walls was a surprise _ 39 full
manuscripts previously unknown to scholars except for a handful that
were exhibited in London in 1931.
   The $7 million purchase was financed by various Smithsonian trust
and acquisition funds and private donors, including the late Dr.
Arthur M. Sackler, chief benefactor of the underground museum that
opened in September 1987.
