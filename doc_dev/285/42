   Talbot, executive director of the California Academy of
Sciences, will assume the post next Jan. 15, according to
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams.

scientists.
   Talbot, 58, a native of Durban, South Africa, is an expert in

Centre for Environmental and Urban Studies at Macquarie University
in Sydney.
   He will succeed Robert S. Hoffmann, who left the post to become
