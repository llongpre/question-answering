   When Spencer Fullerton Baird sent a team of
scientists to Russian Alaska in 1865, he expected them to return to
the Smithsonian Institution with samples of birds, animals and
Eskimo artifacts.
   They brought back all that, as well as evidence of mineral
wealth that helped persuade a reluctant Congress two years later to
spend $7.2 million to buy Alaska from the Russian czar. ``Seward's
Folly'' it was called, after William Henry Seward, who was then
secretary of state.
   Many of the samples collected in those and later expeditions,
including some native American hunting cloaks of astounding beauty,
have gone on display at a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibit that also
features samples collected by 18th century Russian pioneers but
never before shown. The exhibit is at the Smithsonian's Museum of
Natural History.
   ``This is a story that no one country can tell,'' said William
Fitzhugh, curator of the show, which is the fruit of a decade of
planning and cooperation between American and Soviet
anthropologists.
   The exhibit, ``Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and
Alaska,'' also highlights recent scientific findings about the
migration of people across the Bering Strait 11,000 years to 12,000
years ago and the development of native American culture in the far
Northwest.
   And now, 121 years after Alaska was sold for a song, Russian
scholars flocked to the Smithsonian last week for a series of
seminars on the links between ethnic groups in Far Eastern Siberia
and the Eskimo, Aleut, Athapaskan, Eyak and Tlingit peoples of
Alaska and northwestern Canada.
   ``So we learn that the Smithsonian played a leading role in
convincing Congress in the 19th century to buy Alaska,'' said
Aleksandr Potemkin, cultural attache at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington.
   ``It is the same Smithsonian Institution that is playing a
leading role in bringing the neighbors together again,'' he said.
   The exhibition, part of increased cultural cooperation between
the superpowers, breaks new ground in several respects.
   It provides Western scholars with their first look at examples
of Eskimo and Tlingit art collected for the czars by explorers like
Vitus Bering, and by scientists and Russian traders who settled as
far south as San Francisco. Many of the objects have been stored
out of public sight in the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography,
the oldest museum in the Soviet Union, founded in what is now
Leningrad by Peter the Great in 1714.
   In another first, after the exhibition tours the United States,
with stops in Seattle, New York, Indianapolis and Anchorage, it
will go to Ottawa, Canada, and then to Moscow, Leningrad and two
Soviet cities yet to be chosen.
   The rich collection of clothes, hunting devices and other
utensils on display testify to the links between the native
cultures of Siberia and Alaska, and also the differences.
   Many of the Siberian peoples, said Fitzhugh, learned to raise
herds of reindeer. That form of life involves a more complex social
structure than that of the Alaska peoples, who remained largely
hunter-gatherers.
   ``The hunters had a spiritual relation with the animals that
were their prey,'' said Fitzhugh. And when they hunted, they wore
their best clothes, including one elaborate cloak sewn of gut and
decorated with cormorant feathers, Fitzhugh's favorite object in
the exhibit.
