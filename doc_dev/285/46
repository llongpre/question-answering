   The Smithsonian Institution opened a $2.7
million visitors' center Thursday that boasts high-tech computer
displays in the same historic Castle building where Abraham Lincoln
observed hot-air balloon maneuvers during the Civil War.
   Electronic wall maps, touch screen video displays in seven
languages, two movie theaters and scale models of Washington's
downtown tourist attractions _ including one with Braille captions
_ will greet the 3 million visitors who are expected to use the new
Smithsonian Information Center next year.
   One stop at the Victorian-style Castle's great hall, said
Assistant Smithsonian Secretary Ralph Rinzler, ``will help visitors
make the best use of their time at the museums and save them the
frustration of an endless trek from building to building.''
   The Smithsonian has expanded greatly since 1855, when the Castle
was built to house its early scientific collections. Today the
Smithsonian includes 14 museums and galleries, plus the National
Zoo, which attracted 28 million visits last year.
   At the newly renovated ground floor of the Castle, cherrywood
kiosks contain 13 video screens giving tourists detailed
information and travel directions to Smithsonian attractions and
scores of other Washington landmarks.
   Volunteers are available to answer such frequent questions as
``Where is the Wright brothers' plane?'' (in the National Air and
Space Museum) or ``How much is the Hope diamond worth?'' (it's
priceless).
   New ramp entrances at the east and west wings of the building
are designed to accommodate wheelchairs and baby strollers.
Restrooms include diaper-changing facilities.
   In addition, the former Children's Room at the south entrance,
closed nearly a half-century ago to make room for offices, was
restored and reopened to the public Thursday as a lounge.
   Decorated with wall stencils, peacock feathers and ceiling
paintings, the vaulted room resembles its appearance in 1901, when
it was installed with stuffed birds and aquariums of special
interest to children.
   The two-year renovation of the ground floor of the red sandstone
Castle, whose towers, gables and battlements are a familiar sight
on the National Mall, was privately financed by donations from
individuals and several foundations.
   The Castle is a National Historic Landmark whose upper floors
house the offices of Robert McC. Adams, the secretary of the
Smithsonian, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars. It also contains the crypt of James Smithson, the
eccentric English scientist who bequeathed his estate of $515,169
in gold sovereigns to establish the institution in his name.
   The Castle originally provided living quarters for the
Smithsonian's first secretary, Joseph Henry, and his family, and
once served as home for bachelor curators, visiting scientists and
a 30-foot dinosaur skeleton. Its visitors have included Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II, Pope John Paul II and Lincoln, who observed
Union Army reconnaissance balloons from the Castle's main tower.
