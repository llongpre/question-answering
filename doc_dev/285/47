   The Smithsonian Institution has agreed
not to interfere with this seaside town's plan to use a $1 million
bequest to convert an old school into a public library.
   The dispute was over the will of Franz Denghausen, a sculptor
and poet who lived in Rockport for 36 years. He died childless in
1987 and left $1 million to the town to replace the
turn-of-the-century Carnegie Library. The Smithsonian gets at least
$3 million more from Denghausen's estate.
   Ambiguous wording of one phrase in the will had led the
Smithsonian to argue that the town had to spend its own money for
the renovations and use the bequest only for operating and
maintaining the new library.
   The Smithsonian on Friday agreed to drop its challenge.
   ``This is really a terrific resolution to what was a thorny and
complex problem,'' said Attorney General James Shannon, whose
office supported Rockport's position and tried to settle the
dispute.
   Because Rockport cannot afford the renovations without the
bequest, the $1 million would have gone to the Smithsonian if the
museum had prevailed, Shannon said.
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said the museum simply
wanted good relations with the town. ``It was just getting to be a
very, very unhappy story,'' she said.
   Jacobs said the Smithsonian had received about 40 letters
criticizing its position. ``We were greatly distressed that our
motives were misinterpreted,'' she said.
