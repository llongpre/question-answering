<LEADPARA>  The nation's attic is still filling up, according to our spies at the
Smithsonian Institution. Last year it dragged in more than a million new
(actually old) items.;    Most of them came from the Museum of the American
Indian in New York but the haul does include such modern artifacts at a Soviet
SS-20 nuclear missile and Benny Goodman's clarinet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Smithsonian will create a national Indian museum with the collection
from New York, which includes more than a million carvings, masks, dolls,
textiles, baskets, pieces of jewelry and other results of tepee industry.;   
Fascinating non-Amerindian additions include: samples of hair and intestinal
contents from a woolly mammoth (donated by the Soviet Union's Academy of
Science in Leningrad) and a 1921 Ford Model T mail car equipped with skis and
tanklike treads for winter postal deliveries.;    For the National Zoo came a
pair of red wolves, an endangered species that once roamed the Southeastern
United States, 30 geckos -- lizards -- from Madagascar, and a male Sumatran
tiger.;    The Soviet missile went to National Air and Space Museum along with
a U.S. Pershing 2 missile. Both are perfect museum pieces, banned as they are
under the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.;    Yes, they have been
defused. Look them up on your next trip east. They stand side by side in the
Milestones of Flight Gallery.  </TEXT>
