   Carmen E. Turner, general manager of the Metro
transit system in Washington for seven years, was named Wednesday
to the No. 2 post at the Smithsonian Institution.
   Mrs. Turner, 60, will oversee the day-to-day operations of the
world's largest museum and research complex, which includes 15
museums in Washington and New York as well as the National Zoo.
   The appointment will be effective in mid-December. Her salary
was not disclosed.
   Secretary of the Smithsonian Robert McC. Adams praised Mrs.
Turner as an excellent administrator who will take a ``team
approach'' in coping with the Smithsonian's looming financial
crunch and internal management reforms.
   Mrs. Turner, who began her career as a government clerk-typist,
was named chief administrator of the Washington Metropolitan Area
Transit Authority in 1983. Her annual salary is $109,000.
   Metro is the nation's second-largest subway system and fourth
largest bus transit system, with a $615 million annual operating
budget and 9,000 employees.
   The Smithsonian has 6,600 employees and a budget of more than
$500 million.
   She succeeds Smithsonian Undersecretary Dean Anderson, who
resigned in July over what Adams called ``differences in
approach.''
