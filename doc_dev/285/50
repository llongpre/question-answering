   Ex-Gov. Evan Mecham's brief administration
has sparked the historical interest of both the Smithsonian
Institution and the Arizona Historical Society.
   Mecham, a first-term Republican in office just over a year, was
removed from office April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of
two impeachment charges. He also was the subject of recall drive
and faces a May 19 trial on criminal charges accusing him of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The state society's Central Division is building an extensive
collection of material relating to recall him, Andy Masich,
division director, said Monday.
   The Smithsonian's interest began about a month ago. Larry Bird,
curator of the Division of Political History of the institution's
National Museum of American History, asked a Tucson museum official
to send him a bumper sticker and a couple of campaign buttons
commemorating the campaign against Mecham.
   ``Normally, our contemporary collection is limited to national
politics,'' Bird said in a telephone interview. ``But this is a
relatively unusual event.''
   Diane Dittemore, curator of the Arizona State Museum in Tucson,
said she sent Bird a bumper sticker reading ``King Had A Dream,
Arizona Has A Nightmare,'' and two buttons, a red-and-white one
saying ``Mecham Watchdog Committee,'' and a yellow-and-black one
reading ``Recall Ev.''
   Edith Richardson, Mecham's campaign manager, said of the
Smithsonian's acquisition:``I think it's rather sad for an
institution we all regard so highly to display such material.''
   Bird, who studied at the University of Arizona, said he wasn't
sure that the recall material would become a part of the museum's
permanent collection.
   ``We asked for the memorabilia as a matter of routine,'' he
said. ``It's not as if we're making a federal case out of it. Any
scholar who wants to study the phenomenon of the Arizona recall is
more likely to contact a museum there for material than the
Smithsonian.''
   Masich said the society contacted the recall headquarters before
it closed and got an extensive donation of campaign materials.
   ``I'm sure we'll be collecting a lot more,'' he added.
