   A California company is recalling six models
of stuffed animals imported from China because their eyes can
detach, posing a potentially fatal choking hazard.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday there have
been no known deaths or injuries caused by the toys, all of which
contain music boxes.
   The CSPC said the toys have wind-up keys protruding from their
backs and a small white tag sewed to the side or bottom that reads:
``The San Francisco Music Box Company, Emeryville, Ca., Reg. No.
PA-2642 (RC) All New Materials Made In China.''
   Approximately 2,866 of the stuffed animals were distributed
nationwide from December 1988 through June 1989, the CSPC said.
   The names of the animals, their model numbers and the song
played by the music box are:
   _White Jointed Bear, 55-0046, ``You Are My Sunshine.''
   _Beige Jointed Bear, 55-0061, ``Don't Let Me Go.''
   _Beige Small Jointed Bear, 55-0038, ``It's A Small World.''
   _Pink Bear, 55-0079, ``A Baby's Lullabye.''
   _Pink Monkey, 55-0095, ``Zip-a-dee-doo-daa.''
   _Beige Articulated Santa Bear, 55-0368.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The number of inmates in state and federal
prisons grew a record 12 percent last year to 703,687 prisoners,
according to a Justice Department study.
   The inmate population increased 76,099 last year from a 1988
prison population of 627,588 held in state and federal facilities,
said the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics released Sunday.
   The nation's prison population has more than doubled in the last
decade, from 373,866 inmates in 1980 to 703,687 last year, said the
study.
   Only three states _ Kansas, North Dakota and Alaska _ reported
decreases in prison populations last year. The biggest proportional
increase occurred in Rhode Island, where the number of inmates
jumped 30.1 percent, followed by Colorado, with a 26.9 percent
increase.
   South Dakota had the third highest percentage increase _ 25.2
percent _ and Utah ranked fourth with a 21.3 percent jump.

<HEAD>New Indian Museum Director Hopes To Change Native American Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Museum of the American Indian
will be a new type of institution that forever alters the image of
native Americans, according to the New Mexico lawyer selected as
the museum's first director.
   ``My highest aspiration for the National Museum of the American
Indian is that it will reanalyze, redirect and, in many cases,
reformulate entirely the concepts and presentations of the past
concerning Indian culture,'' W. Richard West Jr. said Monday.
   West, of Albuquerque, N.M., and a member of the Cheyenne-Arapaho
tribes, becomes the museum's director effective June 1, the
Smithsonian Institution announced at a news conference Monday.
   West outlined his vision for the museum as a multi-cultural
facility that will reach out, without paternalism or condescension,
to native Americans throughout the hemisphere.
   West, 47, a partner and president of the Indian-owned law firm
of Gover, Steton, Williams &amp; West, has no direct experience running
museums. However, a news release from the Smithsonian stressed his
administrative and fund-raising abilities, and noted he was a
founding member of the Smithsonian's Cultural Education Committee.
   West is also the son of American Indian artist Walter Richard
West Sr. and from 1975 to 1980, was coordinator and treasurer of
the Native American Council of Regents of the Institute of American
Indian Arts in Santa Fe, N.M.

<HEAD>Government Approves Bacteria Treatment for Bladder Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved
use of a live but weakened bacteria to treat a type of bladder
cancer.
   The product, Bacillus Calmette Guerin Live, or BCG Live, was
approved Monday to treat bladder cancer referred to as ``carcinoma
in situ.'' This type constitutes 20 percent to 30 percent of the
45,000 cases of bladder cancer detected in the United States each
year, the FDA said.
   The treatment calls for the bacteria to be administered directly
to the bladder through a catheter to attack the cancer cells on the
lining of the organ. The inflammation that results eliminates many
of the cancer cells.
   Studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute found that 74
percent of patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder responded
to BCG treatment. Of those, the median time for recurrence of the
cancer was four years, the FDA said.
   The product is made by Connaught Laboratories Ltd. of
Willowdale, Ontario, Canada. It will be marketed under the trade
name Theracys.
