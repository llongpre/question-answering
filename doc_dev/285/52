   Last year the Smithsonian Institution acquired
an old Pullman railroad car spittoon, Ray Bolger's scarecrow
costume from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' a giant Pacific octopus, 14
condom vending machines (with 108 condoms), 50 parking meters and
1,272 dry-mounted specimens of lice.
   These and more than 700,000 other objects joined the vast
collections of the Smithsonian, a sort of large national cigar box
where Americans stuff their odds and ends, mostly odd.
   Also carted into the Smithsonian's complex of museums and art
galleries in 1989 were a sculpture made of grapevine roots, an Air
Force C-130A Hercules cargo plane, a satin Chinese hanging scroll
from the Ming dynasty and several thousand world's fair souvenirs
dating to 1850.
   The list includes 75 original paving bricks from the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the original propeller nose cone
removed from Charles Lindbergh's ``Spirit of St. Louis'' airplane
because of a crack, and 2,500 fossils containing imprints of ferns,
crabs and trilobites which lived in a northern Illinois swamp more
than 300 million years ago.
   Officials said the Smithsonian's holdings grew to nearly 138
million objects with last year's acquisitions, many of which came
from private collectors like Clifford Krainik of Alexandria, Va.,
whose passion was ballooning.
   The National Air and Space Museum bought Krainik's 400-item
collection of balloon memorabilia, including Matthew Brady
photographs of Civil War balloons, a balloon-shaped perfume bottle
and valentines, greeting cards, handbills and sheet music about
balloons.
   The biggest recipient was the National Museum of Natural
History. Its 674,817 new items included a pair of stuffed passenger
pigeons from Colorado, a flying lizard from the Philippines, a
football-sized Brazilian quartz crystal containing golden needles,
8,152 mounted specimens of wasps, 30 garments and household objects
used by Tibetan nomads and a piece of petrified timber from Cyprus
that has turned into copper.
   Only a tiny fraction of the Smithsonian's vast collections are
on display at its 14 museums and galleries in Washington and New
York, plus the National Zoo. The bulk of its nearly 138 million
objects are specimens housed in the Natural History Museum and used
for scientific research.
   The giant octopus, by the way, was captured off the coast of
Washington state near Seattle and shipped to the National Zoo,
which also acquired a Sumatran tiger from Indonesia and a three-ton
Asian elephant named ``Toni'' from Scranton, Pa.
