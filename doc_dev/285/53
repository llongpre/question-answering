   The Smithsonian Institution will mark the 500th
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America with a $5 million
series of television documentaries on Latin American history and
culture, written and narrated by Mexican author Carlos Fuentes.
   Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian, told a news
briefing Monday that the five one-hour TV programs entitled ``The
Buried Mirror'' are scheduled to premiere in the fall of 1991.
   Adams said the TV series will ``explore Latin America past and
present, focusing on themes, institutions, beliefs and symbols that
have endured or changed.'' He said the programs will ``seek to
capture the many ways in which Latin Americans have seen themselves
in the past and see themselves today.''
   The executive producer of the series will be Michael Gill, whose
previous TV and film credits include Sir Kenneth Clark's
``Civilization,'' ``The Treasure Houses of Britain'' and ``Alistair
Cooke's America.''
   The bulk of the $5 million cost of the documentaries will be
financed by a group of private investors led by Spanish publisher
Jesus de Planco. Adams said the Smithsonian will contribute an
estimated $2 million.
