   The Smithsonian Institution is drawing heavy
crowds _ and stirring some controversy _ with a huge new exhibit
that traces the information revolution from Samuel F.B. Morse's
first primitive telegraph to an arcade of bleeping computer screens.
   Criticism of the ``Information Age'' show, which opened
Wednesday for a permanent engagement at the National Museum of
American History, stems partly from the decision to let corporate
sponsors pick up the $10 million tab for the largest and perhaps
the most expensive exhibition in Smithsonian history.
   The Washington Post raised the issue of corporate sponsorship in
a lengthy critique of the exhibition, and a reporter questioned
museum director Roger Kennedy on the subject at a briefing last
week.
   Kennedy insisted that the show's content was not influenced in
any way by IBM, AT&amp;T, Unysis, Xerox and other industry giants who
completely bankrolled the exhibit.
   He said the Smithsonian was forced to rely on private support
because congressional budget cuts had left his museum without any
federal funds to mount major exhibitions.
   He dismissed the suggestions of corporate pressure, saying it
was like ``being pelted with beer cans from the bleachers.''
   His boss, Secretary of the Smithsonian Robert McC. Adams, hinted
at some personal misgivings over another aspect of the exhibition,
which climaxes with a daunting display of high-tech wizardry.
   ``I'm not satisfied we have the public well enough
represented,'' Adams said.
   Adams said ``we need to do better'' in dealing with the impact
of computer technology on human beings, such as the potential for
invasion of privacy, the hacker problem and the boredom of sitting
all day at a word processor.
   For all that, the exhibition is a undeniably a dazzler.
   Five years in the making, it boasts 700 artifacts and as many
graphics in 14,000 square feet of gallery space on the museum's
ground floor, which has been wired with more than 10 miles of extra
cable.
   The show includes 78 computers capable of handling a billion
instructions every second and storing the equivalent of a million
typewritten pages of information. There are 43 video monitors, 52
laser videodisc players, 20 ``touch screen'' displays and 24
bar-code scanners _ enough to equip checkout counters at a couple
of supermarkets.
   Visitors begin with a view of Morse's original telegraph
transmitter, conceived in 1832, and exit through a state-of-the-art
chamber of wonders where the sound of Billy Taylor's jazz piano can
be transformed into a cathedral choir at the touch of a button.
   In between, the exhibit includes a working, 2-ton robot once
used to weld automobile bodies at a General Motors plant in
Delaware, the R2-D2 and C3PO robots of ``Star Wars'' fame and the
first public display of the long-secret mechanical computers or
``bombes'' that enabled the Allies to decipher the Germans' vaunted
Enigma radio code in World War II.
   Along the way, there is a 1930s radio studio, a newsreel
theater, early phonograph records and the television camera used to
broadcast the historic Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate in 1960,
plus the UNIVAC I computer that predicted Dwight D. Eisenhower's
victory on election night of 1952.
   Smithsonian officials predicted that the ``Information Age''
will serve as a future model for other museums because of its
unprecedented opportunities for hands-on visitor participation at
computerized displays.
   Viewers can tap out the international distress signal at a
re-creation of the Titanic's radio room, talk over the same
telephone wire used by Alexander Graham Bell, punch in their
demographic profiles to retrieve 1890 census data and ``analyze''
their fingerprints using the FBI's early National Crime
Identification Center computer.
   Sitting at separate computer terminals, visitors can simulate
producing a TV news show, handling a 911 emergency call or trading
on the international currency market. After a few minutes of
frantic buying and selling, based on news flashes on the screen,
the computer informed one visitor that he'd just lost $28,312.
   ``This is the most ambitious, the most wide-ranging and most
prodigious show we have ever done, and it will stay here,'' Adams
said. Museum officials said the exhibit will be updated constantly
to reflect technological advances and suggestions from visitors.
   ``The movement, processing and storage of huge and rapidly
growing amounts of information is not something impersonal _ out
there,'' Adams said. ``The Information Age is probably the driving
force in what has already differentiated us sharply from our
grandparents.''
