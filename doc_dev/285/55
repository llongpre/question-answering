   Would that world famous archeologist, Indiana
Jones, ever have imagined? His own hat and jacket have become the
nation's artifacts.
   The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American
History greeted with pretentious pomp Friday the arrival of its new
objects: Indy's brown fedora and worn leather jacket.
   They were presented by Harrison Ford, the actor who has played
the daring archeologist in two hit movies.
   ``I was surprised, flattered'' at the invitation, he insisted,
although the whole thing was timed perfectly to plug the third Indy
movie just out.
   His trademark attire isn't going on immediate display. But
museum officials said it may someday take its place alongside such
pop-culture treasures as Superman's cape, Dorothy's slippers and
Howdy Doody himself in the History of American Entertainment
Collection.
   Ford and his gifts were welcomed at a news conference, with as
many cameras as any at the White House. Museum director Roger
Kennedy had Ford sign a ``deed of gift'' and did his best to find
some profound significance in Indy, Ford, and what they reflect in
American culture.
   Ford, as Indy, fights ``high-density mythological structures''
and brings the viewer ``escape from the bureaucratization of
American life,'' the museum director said. He said Indy ``has a
kind of redemptive diffidence.''
   How's that?
   ``He is us at our baffled best,'' Kennedy said. ``Mr. Ford has
found a place for us in American drama. He has also managed to make
it fun.''
   Ford's aw-shucks reply: ``That's rather more about me than I had
any notion. I'm flattered to be here and have these artifacts on
display.''
   He donned the fedora for begging photographers, playfully
flipped up the bill, and answered all the usual movie-star
questions.
   No, he won't play Han Solo again in another Star Wars sequel.
Adoring fans, he said, are ``very satisfied customers,'' a bit
disturbing ``but it's a fair deal.''
   For the record, the artifact facts: the fedora is size 7\; the
jacket is custom made in London, no size given.
   And no, they weren't the only ones he wore in the films. He's
kept one jacket for himself. ``I'm sure all the rest have been
destroyed _ shredded,'' he said, not convincing anyone.
   So, what would Indy Jones think of all this?
   ``He'd say, `thank you very much,''' Ford said.
