   When Ken Kesey regrouped the old Merry
Pranksters to drive across the country and maybe donate his
psychedelic bus to the Smithsonian Institution, he had another
trick up his sleeve.
   The bus currently on the road isn't the one that drove into the
lore of the psychedelic 1960s. It's a newer model incorporating
parts of the old and the Smithsonian doesn't want it, institution
spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said Thursday.
   Kesey and the Merry Pranksters became heroes when Tom Wolfe
chronicled their 1964 trip aboard the bus, named Further, in his
``Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.''
   Kesey was a bright new literary light then from his novels ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Sometimes a Great Notion.''
   This week, Kesey and some of the old gang boarded a wildly
painted bus, also named Further. Kesey said they were headed for
the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., though he wasn't sure he'd
give up the bus now since he was having such fun with it.
   Along the way, he's promoting his new book, ``The Further
Inquiry,'' in which the soul of Neal Cassady is put on trial.
Cassady was Further's driver, and the inspiration for the driver in
author Jack Kerouac's ``On the Road.''
   ``The truth is, we had no direct knowledge of his intention to
give the bus to (the Smithsonian) other than what we had been
reading in the paper,'' Jacobs said from Washington.
   ``A few years ago, some of our curators talked to some potential
fund-raisers about the possibility of purchasing or acquiring the
original bus used by Ken Kesey and restoring it. But we were never
successful in reaching Mr. Kesey directly.
   ``The current bus he is using is not even close to the
original,'' she added. ``Even if it were, the Smithsonian is not
interested in a replica.''
   Jacobs said the Smithsonian also was concerned that Kesey was
invoking its name without permission.
   At a stop in Berkeley, Calif., Kesey denied he had tried to pass
off the 1947 International school bus as the 1939 original.
   He said the driver's seat and other parts from the original were
put into the newer bus. Back home at his farm in Pleasant Hill, the
rusted hulk of the original Further sits in a field.
   Kesey said he was miffed at the Smithsonian for never contacting
him when it was interested in restoring his original bus.
   ``I thought it was a little presumptuous of them, and it was
time they deserved a little pranking,'' he said.
   As for Smithsonian officials, Jacobs said they could take a
joke, but wanted the public to know neither Kesey bus was bound for
the museum.
   ``While we appreciate Mr. Kesey's view, which we think is fun -
we need more humor in our lives - we want the general public to
know that is not the case.''
