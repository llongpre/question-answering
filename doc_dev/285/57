   The charred Apollo capsule in which
three astronauts died 23 years ago will be given to the Smithsonian
Institution if museum officials want the spacecraft and agree not
to display it, NASA said today.
   ``We're concerned it not turn into a sideshow of any kind,''
said John Lawrence, chief of congressional affairs for NASA's
Office of Space Flight. ``Of course, the Smithsonian doesn't
operate like that.''
   Remnants of the 1967 Apollo fire _ America's first space tragedy
_ were to have been buried without fanfare this month in an
abandoned missile silo at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The
more than 17,600 pounds of material would have been placed on top
of debris from the nation's only other space disaster, the 1986
Challenger explosion.
   The Apollo capsule and investigative material had been stored at
NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., for 23 years; the
space agency wanted to find a final resting place for it. Some of
the items were moved late last month to Kennedy Space Center
awaiting burial.
   Smithsonian officials indicated this month they were interested
in some of the pieces after turning down offers from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration late last year and in 1985,
Lawrence said.
   Derek Elliott, curator for the National Air and Space Museum,
part of the Smithsonian, has said he is interested in obtaining the
capsule as a historic artifact, not a display item.
   ``That's one reason why we'd want it. It's a historically
significant artifact,'' said Dom Pisano, a museum curator and
chairman of the collections committee that will decide the matter.
   Smithsonian officials have assured NASA a decision will be made
within the next month.
   ``Our clock is ticking. We're anxious to resolve this one way or
another,'' Lawrence said.
   Astronauts Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, Roger B. Chaffee and Edward
H. White II died Jan. 27, 1967, when fire engulfed the capsule
during a countdown rehearsal for the first manned Apollo mission.
The fire, in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen, was triggered
by a spark when a broken or bruised wire beneath Grissom's couch
contacted metal.
