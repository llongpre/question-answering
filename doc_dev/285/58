   The Smithsonian Institution has boosted its
collection with items ranging from jazzman Buddy Rich's drums and a
12.3-pound golden-yellow topaz to the skeleton of a
70-million-year-old shark from Kansas.
   Last year's acquisition of 466,181 items joined the Smithsonian's
collection of 134 million objects, most of them scientific specimens
housed in the National Museum of Natural History for study by
researchers.
   The 6-foot shark skeleton was excavated in Kansas, which was
submerged by ocean waters along with the entire midsection of North
America between 65 million and 100 million years ago, said Dr.
Nicholas Hotton, a research curator at the Natural History Museum.
   Also acquired by the Smithsonian last year, officials said, were:
   _An F-4S ``Phantom'' jet fighter used in the Vietnam War.
   _A supercomputer capable of performing 140 million mathematical
calculations per second.
   _Three pieces of Chinese calligraphy on gold-fleck hand scrolls,
one dating from the early 17th century.
   _25,000 beetle specimens from Venezuela, and 1,297 samples of
volcanic rock from Hawaii.
   _A cotton quilt made in 1847 by a woman in Chester, N.Y., and the
charwoman's costume worn by TV entertainer Carol Burnett.

<NOTE>Congress Told Firefighters Need Better `Right-To-Know' System</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Firefighters nationwide need to be notified
when hazardous materials are present so they can avoid accidents
such as the one that killed six Kansas City, Mo., firemen last year,
a House panel was told.
   ``They had no warning that the fire they were trying to
extinguish was a time bomb waiting to take their lives,'' Terry
Conroy, president of the Kansas City chapter of the International
Association of Firefighters, said Wednesday.
   At a hearing before a House Government Operations subcommittee,
Conroy, other firefighting officials and several members of Congress
said that accident pointed to the need for tighter and more
coordinated regulation of hazardous materials as well as improved
training for firemen.
   The Kansas City firefighters were killed when a trailer loaded
with tons of blasting agent exploded at a highway construction site
Nov. 29. Lawmakers were told that a dispatcher warned the
firefighters that explosives might be in the area but was unable to
provide the specific location or the type of hazardous material
involved.

<NOTE>Expanded Methadone Program Proposed</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies hope to fight AIDS among
heroin addicts by making methadone treatments available to more
addicts sooner and thus reducing exposure to AIDS through
needle-sharing.
   The plan, to be published in today's Federal Register, was
proposed by the Food and Drug Administration and the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. It would allow interim methadone treatment
in cities where comprehensive treatment programs have waiting lists.
   Intravenous heroin addicts often share needles and, in doing so,
become infected with the virus that causes the deadly disease.
   Methadone, which is used to help relieve an addict's craving for
heroin, is taken by mouth, which eliminates the risk from needles.
   Although methadone is best used as part of a comprehensive
treatment program that includes counseling and other vocational and
rehabilitative services, many clinics have waiting lists of six
months or more, the agencies said.
