<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mason E. Hale, an internationally known
Smithsonian Institution botanist, has died of cancer at age 61.
   Hale, who worked for the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History, had published more than 150 studies, including
five books on lichens, which grow as alga and fungus on rocks,
trees and soil.
   He died Monday at his Arlington, Va., home. A memorial service
was held Tuesday.
   In one study, Hale's research found that lead accumulation in
lichens showed a noticeable increase as a result of emissions from
cars crossing a bridge over the Potomac River. The lichens were
found on a Potomac island near Washington.
   During his 33 years at the Smithsonian, Hale built the National
Museum of Natural History lichen collection into the world's third
largest through gifts, exchanges and his world travels.
   A native of Winstead, Conn., Hale received a bachelor's degree
from Yale University and master's and doctorate degrees from the
University of Wisconsin. He taught at the University of Wichita in
Kansas and at the University of West Virginia before he was hired
as a curator in the Museum of Natural History's botany department.
   Survivors include his wife, Beatrice Hale; two daughters; a son;
his mother and two brothers.
