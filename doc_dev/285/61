   For the first time in its 143-year history,
the Smithsonian Institution is trying to attract corporate support
for its vast educational and research activities as a permanent
supplement to federal financing.
   The Smithsonian recently announced the creation of a Corporation
Associate Program, starting next year and intended to raise more
than $1 million annually through corporate contributions or
membership dues.
   The founding chairman of the new fund-raising venture will be
Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Coca-Cola Co.
   Coca-Cola pledged the maximum $25,000 in membership dues under
the new corporate program, which allows companies to co-sponsor a
major special event at the Smithsonian. Corporations choosing to
pay annual dues of $10,000 will be entitled to VIP treatment at
Smithsonian events.
   In the past, corporate support of the Smithsonian has been
confined mostly to underwriting specific museum exhibits or
projects. The new program is intended to generate unrestricted
funds for the whole range of Smithsonian activities, including its
14 museums and art galleries, the National Zoo and various other
educational and research facilities.
   Smithsonian officials said the institution's current
congressional appropriation of $266.7 million is insufficiet to
finance several ambitious new initiatives.
   These include attracting more Hispanics, blacks and other
minorities, developing exhibits focusing on cultural diversity,
environmental and conservation projects; and celebrating the 500th
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America.
   Federal funds, including $30 million in government grants and
contracts, account for 83 percent of the Smithsonian's current
budget of $358.4 million.
   Net income from non-government Smithsonian trust funds, which
include endowments and donations from individuals, foundations and
corporations, is expected to total $61.7 million.
   The estimate of corporate donations in the current fiscal year,
which began Oct. 1, was unavailable, but the combined total of
unrestricted corporate and foundation gifts last year _ not
earmarked for any specific use _ was only $1.6 million.
