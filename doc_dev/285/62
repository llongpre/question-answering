   The Smithsonian Institution acquired 466,181
items last year, including jazzman Buddy Rich's drums, a 12.3-pound
golden-yellow topaz, an oil painting of ex-President Ford and the
complete skeleton of a 70-million-year-old shark from Kansas _ yes,
Kansas.
   The acquisitions joined the Smithsonian's collection of 134
million objects, most of them scientific specimens housed in the
National Museum of Natural History for study by researchers.
   The 6-foot shark skeleton was excavated in Kansas, which was
submerged by ocean waters along with the entire midsection of North
America between 65 million and 100 million years ago, said Dr.
Nicholas Hotton, a research curator at the Natural History Museum.
   Also acquired by the Smithsonian last year, officials said, were:
   _An F-4S ``Phantom'' jet fighter used in the Vietnam War.
   _A supercomputer capable of performing 140 million mathematical
calculations per second.
   _Three pieces of Chinese calligraphy on gold-fleck hand scrolls,
one dating from the early 17th century.
   _Five skins and skulls of wombats, small bear-like creatures,
from Tazmania, Australia.
   _Wallpaper designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
   _25,000 beetle specimens from Venezuela, and 1,297 samples of
volcanic rock from Hawaii.
   _Bumper stickers, posters and lapel buttons from the 1988
Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns.
   _A ceremonial headdress resembling a crocodile, from southeastern
Nigeria.
   _A cotton quilt made in 1847 by a woman in Chester, N.Y., and the
charwoman's costume worn by TV entertainer Carol Burnett.
