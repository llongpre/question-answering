<HEAD>Smithsonian to Charge for Temporary Exhibit on Dinosaurs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   In an unusual but not unprecedented move, the
Smithsonian Institution will charge fees for a temporary exhibit
opening next week.
   Smithsonian Undersecretary Dean Anderson said the charge for
``Dinamation's Dinosaurs Alive and In Color'' was an experiment
that will allow the museum to display an exhibit that otherwise
would be too expensive to produce.
   The exhibition on dinosaurs at the Museum of Natural History
will cost $4 for adults, $2 for children under 12 and will be free
for children under 3.
   ``We pride ourselves on being free to the public.... We have a
sense that coming to the Smithsonian (is) tantamount to an exercise
of citizenship. Only if we're doing something very special does it
make sense to charge a fee,'' Anderson said.
   The Smithsonian joined with Dinamation International Inc. of San
Juan Capistrano, Calif., in a joint venture to develop and show.
The Smithsonian will receive a share of the profits of the show,
which runs through Sept.3.
   Anderson noted that the museum charges admission for its
planetarium and films at the Air and Space Museum. And officials
said the Smithsonian's Arts and Industry Museum charged 25 cents
for an exhibit on drug abuse in the early 1970s.
   The National Zoo, also run by the Smithsonian, will test an
admission charge for another dinosaur exhibit, officials said.
