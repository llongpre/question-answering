   If white America is shocked by what it sees,
the newly authorized National Museum of the American Indian will be
doing its job, says Suzan Shown Harjo.
   ``But I think the white majority culture is tough enough to
understand that slavery and subjugation are not a good idea,'' says
Ms. Harjo, former executive director of the National Congress of
American Indians and a moving force in the museum's establishment.
   Ms. Harjo, 44, a Cheyenne and Creek who was born in El Reno,
Okla., is president of the Morning Star Foundation, an organization
advocating respect for the cultural rights of Indians.
   She was named Monday as one of the 12 Indians required by
Congress to be included in the 25-member board of directors of the
National Museum of the American Indian.
   The museum was authorized last year as the last Smithsonian
museum to be built on the National Mall. It will be squeezed
between the Air and Space Museum and the Capitol. A companion
museum also will be built in New York City's Custom House.
   When completed in 1992, the museum will consolidate the
Smithsonian's big Indian collection with 1 million artifacts,
40,000 books and 86,000 photos in New York City's Museum of the
American Indian, which was short of space and running low on money.
The New York collection is possibly the world's largest.
   In an interview, Ms. Harjo said the museum will acquaint white
Americans with a fresh view of history ``if I have anything to do
with it.''
   And that view may be shocking in a capital where even the name
of the professional football team _ the Washington Redskins _ is as
insulting to native Americans as other epithets would be to other
groups, she said.
   If the museum succeeds, even such a simple schoolday lesson as
``Columbus discovered America'' will have to be freshly thought
through, Ms. Harjo said.
   With a laugh, she suggested that ``America discovered Columbus''
or ``Indians had a lax immigration policy,'' would be a more
accurate way to describe what happened in 1492.
   Her point was that the continent called America was here _ and
populated by developed civilizations _ long before Columbus'
``discovery'' 500 years ago.
   ``They came, we welcomed, they killed _ short history for the
quincentennial,'' she said.
   Ms. Harjo's grievance with the way American Indians' history is
presented is that it treats them as relics. ``We are not discussed
in the present tense, therefore we have no future,'' she said.
   ``The fact is that history has never been written accurately
about native peoples,'' she said. ``It is written by the colonizer
and is designed to justify the land grabs and continued
colonization, the subjugation of a people.''
   As the result, when the Indian won a battle it was a
``massacre''; when white troops won it was a ``victory.''
   ``Telling the truth doesn't mean presenting Indians always in
the most positive light,'' Ms. Harjo said. ``It just means telling
the truth. ... We need an educational program to humanize us in a
way that will counter the dehumanizing, stereotyping and cartooning
that has taken place.''
