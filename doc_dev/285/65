<LEADPARA>  AND NOW a discouraging word about how the West was really won.;    A daring
Smithsonian Institution exhibit called "The West as America" is reinterpreting
artwork by prominent 19th-century artists like Frederic Remington and Thomas
Moran and deflating the national myths of the noble frontier conquest. Plaques
hanging alongside the pieces explain them as "carefully staged fictions"
created to justify Manifest Destiny and westward expansion while rarely noting
damaging social and environmental consequences.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Criticism of the exhibition is coming from such places as the Senate. Last
week, at an Appropriations Committee hearing, two Republican senators, Ted
Stevens of Alaska and Slade Gorton of Washington, accused Smithsonian
officials of pushing a left-wing point of view.;    "I think you've got a
political agenda," Stevens told the officials.;    Other complaints of the
show, which runs through July 7 at the National Museum of American Art, have
been directed not only at its message, but also at the tone with which that
message is conveyed.;     A PAINTING by Charles Schreyvogel of soldiers
attempting to shut a stockade gate on attacking Indians is redefined as a
turn-of-the-century urban metaphor depicting whites "closing the door on
Eastern European and Asian immigrants.";    A flattering "idealized" portrait
of a pioneer family reaching the Sierra Nevada summit above the Sacramento
Valley is criticized for ignoring "the less honorable aspects of California
history -- the profiteering, revolts against Mexican authority and Indian
massacres" that also occurred at that time.;    "A perverse, historically
inaccurate, destructive exhibit," wrote historian and former librarian of
Congress Daniel J. Boorstin in a guest comment book outside the exhibit exit.;
   "It's overdrawn, it's puffed up and I think it's inaccurate in places,"
said Byron Price, executive director of the Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western
Heritage Center in Oklahoma City that lent five paintings to the Smithsonian
project.;    "Some people think we are bludgeoning them, lecturing them and
imposing our point of view," acknowledged William Truettner, the museum's
curator who has studied western art and organized the exhibition.;   
Reinterpreting the mythic west has occupied art historians for several years.
But the Smithsonian exhibit is the most ambitious attempt yet to publicize
that reconstruction.;    "We realized we were going out on a limb," said
Truettner, who spent four years putting together a show that would "challenge
the notion that these paintings are a factual record of the past.";    To get
the message across, the exhibition includes 164 paintings, sculptures,
graphics and photographs and 47 labels. That is more written text than
Truettner said he has used in any previous show. The labels include headings
like "Wishful Thinking II: The White Man's Indian" and "Doing the Old
America.";    They include a racist comment from Remington -- "Jews, Injuns,
Chinamen, Italians, Huns, the rubbish of the earth I hate" -- in an attempt to
explain how that attitude influenced one of his frontier paintings depicting
five pioneer men crouched inside a water hole, firing rifles at attacking
Indians.;    "Is 'Fight for the Water Hole' simply a transcription of a
frontier event or does it borrow its imagery -- a group of outnumbered whites
desperately defending against the 'strike' of a racial enemy -- from the urban
world where Remington lived?" asks the accompanying text.;     COPIES of old
California fruit crate labels are criticized for their "milk and honey"
landscapes. A painting of Kit Carson riding with two men by artist Charles
Russell is explained as a "grandiose equation between Carson and Christ.";   
An oil of two Indian tribes attacking one another in uneven numbers is said to
transmit "a stereotypical idea of the imbalance or disorder of Indian
culture.";    It is that kind of accompanying language that is stirring most
debate, said Elizabeth Broun, director of the museum. She has heard little
criticism of the show's theme and a majority of written comments have been
favorable.;    "Most people who've complained think we're too humorless and
relentless," she said. "We've laid it on. If we were starting over, maybe we
would have used a lighter touch. But removing labels now would raise more
questions than it would answer.";    The exhibition was scheduled to appear at
two other museums, the Denver Art Museum and the St. Louis Art Museum, but
both institutions have canceled. Broun said the cancellations were because of
lack of funding, not the controversy.;    Meanwhile, the National Museum of
American Art has doubled its attendance since the exhibit opened March 15.
Visitors have already filled a fat guest book with comments and are rapidly
filling a second.;    Wrote one: "May I suggest an exhibit exploring the
influence of peyote on modern art historians' analogies of western art?"  </TEXT>
