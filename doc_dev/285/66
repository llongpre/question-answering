<LEADPARA>  The California Dancing Raisins finally have leaped into the nation's attic,
there to join the Marlboro Man in a celebration of creative profit seeking.
This took place at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American
History.;   Smithsonian officials, while acknowledging the controversy that
still revolves around a museum accepting advertising material, cited the
creative edge demonstrated in the "Claymation" Dancing Raisin campaign.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It really represents a revolution in theatrical production, an
amalgamation between technology and art," museum historian Ellen Roney Hughes
explained.;   And she has a point. Advertising is a major element, or at least
a pervasive one, in American culture, like it or not. How else to explain the
success of Andy Warhol and Pop Art?;   Whatever the case, if you want to see
the Raisins from now on, you'll find them at the Smithsonian.  </TEXT>
