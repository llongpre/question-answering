<LEADPARA>  The 5-year-old California Raisins apparently are now as much a part of
Americana as Archie Bunker's chair and Irving Berlin's song sheets. Or so the
Smithsonian Institution has deemed.;    The venerable clay-animated raisins
are on their way to the Smithsonian's Museum of American History in
Washington, D.C., where they'll be inducted into the museum's American pop
culture collection.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     En route, the raisins -- in what's billed as the California Raisin
Retrospective -- will stop in five cities.;    The clay-animated raisins are
from a series of commercials the California Raisin Advisory Board began
running in 1986 to the tune of "I Heard It Through The Grapevine.";    The
exhibit, which opens today in Seattle, includes the board's latest commercial
effort, known as "Robot." That commercial begins airing Oct. 28.;    So far,
Smithsonian has not indicated when the raisins might be displayed.  </TEXT>
