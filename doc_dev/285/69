   A glittering collection of gold jewelry and
ornaments from West Africa, where gold was shunned in ancient times
as an evil spirit, begins a three-year, nine-city tour of the
United States on Wednesday at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of African Art.
   The handiwork of goldsmiths from Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali and
Senegal comes from the private Barbier-Mueller Museum of Geneva,
which houses one of the finest collections of African gold
sculpture in the world.
   More than 150 handmade objects, comprising about half of the
Barbier-Mueller collection, are going on display at the
Smithsonian. They include elaborate necklaces, rings, hair jewels,
pendants, masks, earrings, beads and ceremonial regalia such as
gold-decorated fly whisks, sword handles and staffs.
   Guest curator Timothy Garrard, a British historian and authority
on the gold trade in West Africa, said gold dust and nuggets long
were regarded with fear by natives who believed they would cause
blindness and insanity.
   Africans began their goldsmith traditions in the 5th century,
when European traders, alerted by slave merchants, sailed down the
west coast of Africa or crossed the Sahara Desert in caravans from
North Africa to trade salt and spices for gold.
   Very little of ancient West African gold jewelry exists today
because it was lost in trade, looted from burial grounds and melted
down to make coins or new ornaments. Garrard said the oldest piece
in the Smithsonian show probably is a fish pendant in pure gold _
about 22 carats _ from 18th century Ghana.
   After the show closes at the National Museum of African Art on
Aug. 28, it is scheduled to travel through July 1992 to art museums
in New York; Dallas; Birmingham, Ala.; Tampa, Fla.; Chicago;
Detroit; Indianapolis, and Louisville, Ky.
