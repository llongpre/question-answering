   Agreements to return the skeletal remains of
American Indians and to renovate a museum in New York City are
helping push plans to create a National Museum of the American
Indian here closer to realization.
   Reps. Charles Rangel and Ted Weiss, both New York Democrats, met
last week with Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, and all agreed that the Smithsonian would renovate the
current museum, in upper Manhattan, to create an exhibition space,
spokesmen said Monday.
   ``We have agreed to renovate 2,000 square feet to bring it up to
certain security, safety and basic standards of museum exhibitry,''
said Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs.
   In a related matter, Adams, Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
D-Colo., and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, on Tuesday were to
announce an agreement between the Smithsonian and American Indian
groups on the return on skeletal remains in the museum's possession.
   The issue could have been another obstacle to passing Indian
museum legislation but Jacobs said that problem has been resolved.
   ``There's kind of a realization that's dawning that the spiritual
needs of the living Indian people, as well as their spiritual
traditions, have to be considered, and not secondarily to
archaeological pursuits,'' said Carolyn Light, a spokeswoman for
Campbell.
   The Smithsonian has a collection of the bones of approximately
18,000 Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, most of which were unearthed
during archaeological excavations, construction or erosion. About
4,000 of the specimens came from the Army Medical Museum, and were
transferred to the Smithsonian at the turn of the century.
   The New York congressmen had been unhappy with a plan to move the
current Museum of the American Indian from Audubon Terrace to the
old U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan and transfer the bulk of
the collection to a new museum to be built on the Mall in
Washington. They were displeased that the agreement reached in May
did not guarantee a continued presence at Audubon Terrace.
   According to language drafted last week, the Smithsonian will
lend artifacts and exhibitions to a successor museum at Audubon
Terrace, and provide training, technical assistance and other
support to the facility.
   Adams has estimated it would take about five years to build the
new museum in Washington, once Congress passes legislation
authorizing and funding it.
