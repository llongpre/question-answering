The Smithsonian Institution opened a $2.7-million visitors' center Thursday 
that boasts high-tech computer displays in the same historic Castle building 
where Abraham Lincoln observed hot-air balloon maneuvers during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic wall maps, touch screen video displays in seven languages, two movie 
theaters and scale models of Washington's downtown tourist attractions will be 
available to the 3 million visitors who are expected to visit the new 
Smithsonian Information Center next year. 
</P>
<P>
One stop at the Victorian-style Castle's great hall, Assistant Smithsonian 
Secretary Ralph Rinzler said, "will help visitors make the best use of their 
time at the museums and save them the frustration of an endless trek from 
building to building." 
</P>
<P>
The Smithsonian has expanded greatly since 1855, when the Castle was built to 
house its early scientific collections. Today, the Smithsonian includes 14 
museums and galleries, plus the National Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
At the newly renovated ground floor of the Castle, cherry-wood kiosks contain 
13 video screens giving tourists detailed information and travel directions to 
Smithsonian attractions and scores of other Washington landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the former Children's Room at the south entrance, closed nearly a 
half-century ago to make room for offices, was restored and reopened to the 
public Thursday as a lounge. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year renovation of the ground floor of the red sandstone Castle, whose 
towers, gables and battlements are a familiar sight on the National Mall, was 
privately financed by donations from individuals and several foundations.
