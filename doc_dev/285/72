   Smithsonian Institution curators are busy
cataloguing a monumental new collection of nearly 200 years of
popular American sheet music, including stacks of rare,
long-forgotten Broadway melodies by George Gershwin and Irving
Berlin.
   This bonanza from the nation's musical past, a gift from Fort
Wayne, Ind., broadcaster Sam deVincent, consists of 130,000
original editions of illustrated sheet music, nearly 20,000
recordings and boxes of posters, concert programs, newspaper
clippings and other memorabilia.
   ``This is one of the great, legendary collections of sheet music
in the world,'' said John Edward Hasse, curator of American music
at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. ``It
contains some of the rarest of the rare.''
   The scope of the deVincent collection is staggering. It ranges
from yellowing reprints of parlor piano pieces of the 1790s to
mournful Civil War ballads, the shameless bigotry of minstrel show
music, railroad songs and ragtime, military marches, antiwar
protest songs, Beatles favorites and political campaign choruses.
   The bulk of the collection focuses on the golden era of Tin Pan
Alley, from the 1890s to the 1940s, when Gershwin, Berlin, Cole
Porter and other great songwriters were churning out Broadway show
tunes.
   Scores of large cartons in the museum's archives are stuffed
with their most memorable hits and some of their most forgettable
words and lyrics.
   Among the latter is a 1919 Gershwin song titled
``Tee-Oodle-Um-Bum-Bo'' and a few of Hoagy Carmichael's obscure
World War II morale boosters, including ``I'm a Cranky Old Yank in
a Cranky Old Tank ...''
   Berlin wrote ``I'm the Guy Who Guards the Harem (And My Heart's
in My Work)'' for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1919. And little
remembered from his 1933 hit musical, ``Easter Parade,'' is a song
titled ``I Say It's Spinach.''
   As America sang deeper into the Depression, Berlin wrote:
   ``Things don't come on a silver platter,
   ``What does it matter,
   ``Long as there's you, long as there's me,
   ``Long as the best things in life are free,
   ``I say it's spinach,
   ``The hell with it, the hell with it, that's all!''
   Hasse says the deVincent collection, a rich and diverse
repository of Americana, will give historians an intimate portrait
of the nation's cultural tastes and social upheavals over the past
two centuries.
   No fewer than 500 songs give testimony to America's love affair
with the automobile. Others trace the rise of labor unionists,
suffragettes and abolitionists. Popular songs toasted Charles
Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, lamented the Titanic's
sinking and poked fun at peculiarities of East European immigrants.
   Cover illustrations document the rise and fall of fashion styles
and popular dance steps, from Revolutionary-era quadrilles to the
waltz, two-step, cakewalk, ballroom marches, bunny hop and turkey
trot, tango, Charleston, jitterbug and Twist.
   Some of the sheet music covers are decorated with outstanding
examples of the illustrator's art. Winslow Homer, later to gain
fame as a painter and watercolorist, sketched a cover for the 1850s
song ``Kitty Clyde.'' George M. Cohan's patriotic World War I song,
``Over There,'' featured a Norman Rockwell painting of four
doughboys singing around a campfire.
   The collection represents a 60-year labor of love by deVincent,
retired music director of Fort Wayne radio station WOWO, who began
hoarding sheet music as a 12-year-old in Chicago.
   By 1978, while Hasse was writing a doctoral dissertation on
ragtime music at Indiana University, deVincent's collection had
filled his two-car garage and spilled into nearly every room of his
home.
   ``When I saw his ragtime holdings, I was flabbergasted, I was
speechless,'' Hasse said. ``I quickly realized the tremendous value
of his collection, and made a vow to myself that I would try to
help it find a good home someday.''
   Hasse, who joined the Smithsonian in 1984, played a leading role
in negotiating the museum's acquisition of the deVincent
collection, which was shipped to Washington in the spring of 1988
in five truckloads.
   DeVincent says the rarest items in his collection include an
original copy of Berlin's first published song, ``Marie From Sunny
Italy,'' written in 1907, and a first edition of ``Old Zip Coon,''
an 1816 minstrel song that later became known as ``Turkey in the
Straw.''
   Even the eminent Cohan wrote ``coon songs'' for the popular
blackface minstrel shows of his day, Hasse noted.
   ``We may find the lyrics distasteful today,'' he said, ``but it
is important for historians to preserve this material so we can
understand the past and build a better future.''
