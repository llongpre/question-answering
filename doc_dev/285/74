   Jon Provost, child star of the ``Lassie''
television show of three decades ago, will soon start filming a new
version of the long-popular TV series for broadcast next fall,
playing an uncle of the dog's young masters.
   Now 39 and a real estate agent in Santa Rosa, Calif., Provost
was a surprise visitor at the preview Tuesday of a new exhibition
celebrating 50 years of American television. The yearlong show
opens today at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
American History.
   Touring the exhibit of 200 artifacts and more than 100
photographs tracing the history of U.S. television, Provost paused
for a nostalgic look at the costume he wore as Timmy in the
original ``Lassie'' series.
   Provost had made a gift to the Smithsonian of the red-checkered
sports shirt, blue jeans and black-topped tennis shoes he wore on
the show from 1957 until 1964. The actor was 7 years old when he
began filming the series, and quit the show when he was 14.
   ``It really was a thrill to be asked to donate them to the
Smithsonian,'' he said.
   Provost said he will play an uncle on the new syndicated
``Lassie'' show, which will star Dee Wallace Stone and her
real-life husband, Christopher Stone, as the parents. The new TV
family's pet collie will be the eighth generation descendant of the
original Lassie, he said.
   Last week, during preliminary filming in Los Angeles with the
full cast, Provost said ``it really brought back memories'' to make
friends with the new Lassie. ``We definitely will be building a
relationship, I think,'' he said.
   The museum exhibit, underwritten by the consumer electronics
group of the Electronic Industries Association, traces the history
of American television from its inauguration at the New York
World's Fair in April 1939.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt's speech at the opening
ceremonies was broadcast to about 200 TV receivers in metropolitan
New York, marking the start of regular television service in the
United States.
   Highlights of the show include the RCA television receiver,
encased in Lucite, which was displayed at the World's Fair and
other early TV sets.
   Memorabilia on display include Archie Bunker's wing chair from
``All In The Family,'' the pith helmet worn by Marlin Perkins, host
of the ``Wild Kingdom'' show, J.R. Ewing's cowboy hat from
``Dallas,'' the Howdy Doody marionette, the leather jacket that
Henry Winkler wore as the Fonz on ``Happy Days'' and a stainless
steel coffee pot used on the soap opera, ``The Guiding Light.''
   At the preview Tuesday, museum director Roger G. Kennedy said
the exhibition seeks to illustrate the dramatic growth of
television's influence on American society since World War II.
   ``Aside from instruments of mass destruction,'' he said,
``television is probably the most significant lever of change in
the American psyche in the past two generations.''
