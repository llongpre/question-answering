   The contribution of women to the Hispanic
culture of the United States is being featured at this year's
National Hispanic Heritage Week sponsored by the Smithsonian
Institution.
   Beginning Sunday, the weeklong celebration of performances,
lectures and exhibitions will mix Tex-Mex music and Latin jazz with
a review of the role of Hispanic women under the theme, ``500 Years
of Hispanic Heritage, 1492-1992: The Women's Contribution.''
   ``They are the carriers of the culture and traditions,'' says
Luz Maria Prieto, Hispanic-American history program coordinator at
the National Museum of American History.
   ``A very important part of their work was in the family, the
community, the workplace and the church,'' Ms. Prieto says. ``The
woman has always played a pivotal role, a crucial role in her
community.''
   Manuel J. Melendez, coordinator of Hispanic Week for the
Smithsonian, says that women ``did the nudging, the reminding. They
were the ones who had to hold it together, while the husbands were
out there working. ...
   ``Unbeknownst to them, their ingenuity was integral to the labor
movement _ when their husband came home from work, they would
bounce their ideas off the women and how they handled it is a
reflection of the countless conversations that take place in the
home,'' Melendez says.
   Scheduled events include Ruby Nelda Perez of San Antonio, Texas,
performing the one-woman play, ``A Woman's Work,'' and Jesus
``Chuy'' Negrete of the Mexican Cultural Institute of Chicago
performing some of his ``corridos,'' _ narrative ballads based on
the lives and histories of Mexican-American workers in the Midwest.
   At a ``Latina workers historical forum'' Blanca Vasquez of the
center for Puerto Rican studies at Hunter College in New York will
talk about Puerto Rican garment workers and Cynthia Orozco of the
University of California at Los Angeles will discuss the feminist
history of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
   Other activities include lectures by astronaut Sidney Gutierrez
and Reinaldo Arenas, one of today's leading Cuban writers in exile;
a performance of Latin rhythms and fiery jazz improvisation by
Hilton Ruiz; a Tex-Mex concert by Little Joe y la Familia; and
guided tours in Spanish and English of the National Museum of
American Art.
