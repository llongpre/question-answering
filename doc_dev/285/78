   A Japanese consortium has pledged $1.5 million
toward renovation of the Freer Gallery of Art, a national museum of
Asian art and the Smithsonian Institution's first art museum,
gallery officials announced Monday.
   The gift is the largest received by the gallery since it opened
in 1923 with a bequest from Detroit industrialist Charles Lang
Freer, who gave the Smithsonian his art collection, a building fund
and an endowment.
   The Japanese gift will be used to finance reinstallation of the
original Freer collection of 13,000 objects, most of them Asian art
but also including the world's most important collection of works
by American painter James McNeill Whistler.
   A $21 million renovation and expansion of the Freer museum began
in late 1988 and is scheduled for completion in late 1992. The
Japanese gift leaves $4.5 million still to be raised, officials
said.
   The Japanese consortium consists of Prof. Ikuo Hirayama, a
painter and president of the National University of Fine Art and
Music; the Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. and the Nomura Cultural
Foundation of Tokyo.
