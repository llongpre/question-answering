   The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution has approved the main parts of an agreement to transfer
the largest collection of American Indian artifacts from New York to
Washington for permanent display.
   The agreement in principle, reached last week, would create a
national museum of the American Indian on the Washington Mall as
part of the Smithsonian but would keep a smaller satellite museum in
New York City, to be situated in the old U.S. Custom House in lower
Manhattan.
   Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian, said at a press
briefing after the regents met Monday that only technical issues
remain. ``I don't think any are of fundamental importance,'' he said.
   The Museum of the American Indian has for years been trying to
move from a small Upper Manhattan building which is only big enough
to display about 1 percent of the collection of more than 1 million
artifacts. The bulk of the collection has been stored for many years
in a Bronx warehouse.
   Title to the Heye Collection of Indian artifacts would be
transferred to the Smithsonian, pending approval by the New York
state attorney general and state courts.
   Adams indicated he believed a final agreement would go to the
Smithsonian's executive board before May 15, the deadline for
Congress to allocate funds for the national museum in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1. The Smithsonian cannot build a new museum
without congressional approval and federal money.
