   Three families who have lived a rent-free
rural life for years are being forced to move by their landlord,
the Smithsonian Institution.
   ``I don't know why they want us to move. I feel very bad and
shocked,'' said Edith Tongue, who has lived in her small house for
about 15 years.
   Mrs. Tongue, 47, and her 20-year-old son are one of five
low-income families living on 2,600 acres of nature preserve the
Smithsonian owns on the Rhode River in Edgewater and Harwood.
   At least one house does not meet county health regulations
because it lacks a water and septic system. Other houses need
extensive repairs.
   The Smithsonian decided this year to get out of the ``landlord
business,'' spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said Tuesday. ``We do not
want people to live on our property. We're just not able to serve
as a landlord.''
   The agency has asked Mrs. Tongue and two other families to move
by August 1989. It is reviewing the status of another family. One
elderly woman with a legal claim to tenancy will be permitted to
stay. A sixth tenant moved in June, and his house has been
demolished.
   Most of the families moved to the property decades ago. The
owners sold the land to the Smithsonian during the past 20 years,
but the tenants remained.
   Anne Arundel County officials say they will make public housing
or rental subsidies available to the tenants by next August, Ms.
Jacobs said. The Smithsonian will evict those who refuse
alternative housing, she said.
   Rebecca Smith, 73, of Edgewater, said she did not know where she
would go.
   The retired maid plans to apply for public housing assistance,
although she would rather not live in a housing project.
   She does not blame the Smithsonian, however.
   ``It belongs to them. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing
I can be angry about,'' she said.
