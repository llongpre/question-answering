   An unclassified small whale has been discovered
in Peru, and scientists at Washington's Smithsonian Institute call
it a new species, government and newspaper reports said Saturday.
   The whale, dubbed Mesoplodon Peruvianus, belongs to a genus of
beaked whales. However, it differs in its relatively short length of
14 to 24 feet, the government gazette El Peruano said.
   The Mesoplodon Peruvianus has characteristics similar to other
small whales, porpoises and dolphins, the gazette quoted Carlos del
Rio, president of the Peruvian National Council of Science and
Technology, as saying. He said the whale has never before been
classified, according to the report.
   Del Rio said the scientific world was first alerted to the
possibility of a new species when James G. Mead of the Smithsonian
Institute's National Museum of Natural History discovered a skull
fragment of the whale on a beach near Lima in 1976.
   Mead was not available for comment Saturday.
   Del Rio said that since the initial find, a few of the whales
have been accidentially caught in fishermen's nets or have washed up
on Pacific beaches in central Peru. However, he said none has so far
been seen alive in its natural habitat.
   The weekly newspaper Lima Times reported that the Smithsonian
termed the whale a new species after studies of a carcass of an
adult whale, which had been found intact earlier this year.
   The Peruvian conservation group Ecco, which participated in the
search and classification, said scientists are still unsure why the
species has not been spotted elsewhere. Ecco Vice President Tony
Luscombe of the United States said the whales may need the cold
Pacific currents that wash the shores of Peru and Chile.
