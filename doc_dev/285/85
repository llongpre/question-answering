<LEADPARA>  A former mayor couldn't do it, but a barrage of letters from third-grade
students in Morgan Hill has swayed the mighty Smithsonian Institution.;   No
longer is the source of poppy jasper said to be "near Gilroy." Now visitors to
the Smithsonian's mineralogy display are told that Morgan Hill is the only
place the quartz with the bright red poppy design is found.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Former Morgan Hill Mayor Beth Wyman was visiting the Smithsonian in late
1989 when she saw the poppy jasper label. She later wrote the Smithsonian
asking that Morgan Hill be given its due.;   Her pleas did not move officials
at the Washington museum.;   "I am afraid that it isn't going to happen,"
wrote John Sampson White, curator of the Smithsonian's mineralogy division.
"If we were to do what you suggest for poppy jasper, then we would have to do
the same for countless other specimens.";   Wyman mentioned the story this
spring during a lecture on local history to students in Jane May's class at
Paradise Valley School. Twenty-seven students wrote letters, telling the
museum politely but emphatically that accuracy is the hallmark of a
world-class museum.;   After receiving the students' letters, White, who
retired in July, wrote May and her students. He defended the "near Gilroy"
designation, saying: "It is customary with museum specimen labels to use names
that are more likely to be known or at least findable on a map.";   The poppy
jasper was labeled that way in 1930, he said, when "Morgan Hill either didn't
exist as a community or was so small that no one would have known it." The
city was incorporated in 1906.;   But White promised to ask the exhibits
department to print a new label. On June 10, a new card went up.;   On
Thursday, Russell Feather, a museum specialist at the Smithsonian, said the
museum never intended to slight Morgan Hill.;   Requests such as the Morgan
Hill third-graders made don't occur often, Feather said, adding, "We try to
honor them." The only similar requests he could recall involved the spelling
of a couple of foreign names.;   Bren White, principal at Paradise Valley
School, said Thursday that May's students were ecstatic when they learned the
museum had granted their request.;   "The reaction was like, 'Wow! Look what
we did. We can talk to a big institution and it listens,' " White said.;   May
is traveling in Europe and could not be reached for comment.;   Poppy jasper,
Wyman says, has been found in only two places in Morgan Hill. One is on the
west side of El Toro Mountain and the other was paved over when Santa Teresa
Boulevard was widened near the city's southern boundary.  </TEXT>
