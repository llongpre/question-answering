<LEADPARA>  From our spies in Washington:;   The renovation of two floors of the old U.S.
Custom House in lower Manhattan is about to begin, and to mark the occasion,
Jack Swamp, chief of the Wolf Clan of the Mohawk Nation, rode in Thursday to
perform a rite normally overlooked in construction projects: purifying the
building.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The landmark site is to house the New York branch of the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of the American Indian, so no one there thought
it strange when Chief Swamp invoked the Great Spirit.;   Surrounded by a
circle of 110 spectators, he went from one to another with a smoldering
footlong braid of sweet grass that emitted a scent similar to incense. Some
people put their hands into the smoke, then touched their faces.;   "We use
the sweet grass to purify homes or buildings; actually it is the incense that
purifies," Chief Swamp explained before the ceremony.;   "I am trying to
remove the old spirits that used to belong to the building, the spirits of the
past. The smoke will purify the work we will be involved with in the future.";
  The rite performed, Chief Swamp declined to ride dramatically into the
sunset: He had a date in New Jersey to plant trees for peace.  </TEXT>
