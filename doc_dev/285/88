   The history of Asian Jews, a story spanning 25
centuries and covering 13 lands, is told in a new, colorful and
imaginative permanent exhibit in the Hall of Asian Peoples at the
American Museum of Natural History here.
   The exhibit centers around a spacious wall grid that indicates
diagrammatically the diversity of Asian Jewish life through history
in many different lands. On the grid are placed appropriate
examples of ceremonial and folk art objects, portraits and
quotations to bring the history to life.
   At the same time, two screens make available interactive video
programs by means of which museum visitors can explore individual
areas that interest them.

   The ninth annual Robert F. Kennedy Book Awards
have been won by Neil Sheehan and Jonathan Kozol.
   Sheehan was cited for ``A Bright and Shining Lie,'' a biography
of John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam. The judges said the book
``cuts to the marrow of what transpired in Vietnam _ from the
swamps and the grunts to the top of the command structure.''
   Kozol's ``Rachel and Her Children'' was called ``a vivid
description of what it's really like to live in squalid places. It
illustrates the tragedy of America's homeless families.''

the Metropolitan Museum of Art through July 16.
   ``Goya and the Spirit of the Englightenment'' includes more than
125 paintings, drawings and prints.
   The museum says that ``to convey the dymamic interchange between
the artist and the advanced thinkers of his day some of Goya's
greatest portraits of his Spanish contemporaries are shown
alongside little-known drawings and rare proofs of his etchings.''
