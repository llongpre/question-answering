   The world's largest tick collection could
be headed for a climate-controlled pod in a museum because no one
in the government wants to give the 1 million little blood-suckers
a home.
   The Smithsonian Institution and the National Institutes of
Health can't agree on which one should pay the $200,000 necessary
in fiscal 1989 to keep the government's Acarology Unit in business.
   The unit is home to 1 million tick specimens _ deceased, in case
you were wondering or worrying _ that have been painstakingly
collected by researchers over decades.
   If no agreement is reached by Sept. 30, the ticks will go into
the museum equivalent of cold storage and the lab will be no more.
   It's not your typical tale of government cutbacks, but a
potential tragedy nonetheless, according to entomologists and
health officials who note the tick's role in carrying disease and
the importance of research on the tiny, blood-sucking arachnids.
   ``The unit and the collection are unique, and are the backbone
of tick research in the United States and abroad,'' George
Eickwort, president of the Acarological Society said in a letter
seeking help from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The funding dispute threatens a unique research program overseen
by NIH taxonomist Jim Keirans, who presides over the unit at the
Smithsonian's Museum Support Center in the Washington suburb of
Suitland.
   Public health officials, veterinarians, armed forces physicians
and zookeepers the world over know when they find a tick they can't
identify, Jim Keirans is their man.
   The unit's supporters describe it as the only place on the
planet where researchers can send ticks for identification,
critical to scientists trying to track the more than 20 tickborne
diseases that plague humans:
   Common diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted
fever. More exotic diseases like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
and Kyasanur forest disease. Other diseases that infect livestock
and wild animals.
   Scientists and a group of congressmen have rallied to the unit's
support, urging NIH to save the lab for the good of the public
health.
   ``The collection and Dr. Keirans have been instrumental in the
accurate identification of tick species which serve as vectors of
disease, including the identification of a new species, Ixodes
dammini, as the principal vector for transmitting Lyme disease,''
Eickwort wrote in his letter to Kennedy.
   The Suitland laboratory was created in 1983 when NIH moved its
tick collection from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Hamilton,
Mont., to the Smithsonian.
   From 1984 to 1987, Keirans and his assistant, Richard Robbins,
received 14,113 tick specimens, most from agricultural and
veterinary researchers.
   ``We have received them pinned, we have received them
Scotch-taped, we have received them just dropped in an envelope,''
Keirans said during a recent tour of the spacious and orderly lab.
   The collection became the world's largest with the addition of
the specimens, papers and books of Harry Hoogstraal, head of the
zoology department at a Navy research unit in Egypt for more than
35 years. Hoogstraal was the world's pre-eminent tick expert until
his death in 1986.
   Keirans said the 1983 move came when NIH decided to get out of
medical entomology, the study of insect-borne disease, and focus on
AIDS research. NIH agreed to pay the salaries of Keirans and a
technician for two years; when the agreement expired, it was
extended to September 1988.
   But NIH is no longer interested in having a medical entomologist
housed at the Smithsonian, he said.
   Smithsonian spokesman William Schulz said the museum tried to
raise funds for the tick unit, but never said it would pay for the
facility and never felt there was ``some deadline where we would
take over the staff salaries.''
   John LaMontagne, NIH's director of microbiology and infectious
disease program, sees it differently. He said institute officials
felt that the ticks belonged at the Smithsonian, and ``the
Smithsonian originally said that they were interested in it.''
   ``It's my understanding now that their assessment of it now is
not quite in line with that. I think they get uncomfortable with
the public health and service kind of needs that the collection
implies.''
   NIH officials appointed 11 researchers familiar with the lab to
consider the issue. In March, they concluded that the unit should
be funded by NIH, with the Smithsonian continuing to provide space
and equipment.
   LaMontagne said NIH is looking into several options: financial
support from the Department of Agriculture and Walter Reed Army
Hospital, both heavy users of the unit's taxonomy service; or some
fiscal legerdemain, which would move the unit's funding to another
part of the NIH budget.
   Twenty-two federal legislators, led by Rep. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., wrote last month to Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, urging NIH to continue funding
the lab.
   Hochbrueckner, whose Long Island district has high incidences of
Lyme disease, which causes temporary paralysis, and tick-borne
babesiosis (a malaria-like fever) has become one of the tick
program's biggest boosters.
   He says that if NIH doesn't want the tick program, someone else
should give it a home.
   ``I don't really care where they stay,'' he said.
