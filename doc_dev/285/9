   Officials of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Museum of the American Indian in New York signed an agreement
Monday to transfer the world's largest collection of American
Indian artifacts to the Smithsonian.
   As a symbol of the agreement, Roland Force, director of the New
York museum, presented Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the
Smithsonian, with a peace pipe-tomahawk.
   ``This single piece does, in a very real way, symbolize the
entire collection,'' Force said of the pipe, which had been given
to Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief, by Col. Henry A. Proctor of the
British Army in 1812.
   The museum agreement capped years of often-acrimonious
negotiations among federal, state and local politicians, officials
of the Smithsonian and the Indian museum, and American Indians
concerned for the preservation of their heritage.
   A memorandum of understanding covering the transfer was signed
at a ceremony overlooking the site where the Smithsonian hopes to
build the National Museum of the American Indian. The museum _
which would be the Smithsonian's 14th in Washington _ is to display
objects from the Heye Foundation collection of more than a million
artifacts.
   ``I don't think there ever will have been a museum quite like
the one we foresee, with great confidence, going up on the site
behind me,'' Adams said, with his back to the plot between the
National Air and Space Museum and the U.S. Capitol, the last
available place on the Mall.
   The signing came after the Smithsonian board of regents voted,
without dissent, to approve a plan to build a national Indian
museum in Washington and also to move the existing Museum of the
American Indian to larger quarters in the old U.S. Custom House, a
landmark lower Manhattan building owned by the federal government.
Part of the collection will be exhibited at the new New York site.
   Under the agreement, the Smithsonian also will build additional
storage space at its museum support center in Suitland, Md., for
the part of the collection moving to Washington.
   Suzan Harjo, a member of the New York museum's board and herself
an AmericanIndian, said she hoped the new museum would foster ``a
great healing process in America'' between Indians and other
Americans.
   ``It's going to be a long way between now and actual bricks and
mortar, but this is more than a museum; it has more than that
meaning to all of us,'' she said.
   Legislation is still needed to give the Smithsonian the millions
of dollars necessary for the undertaking. The plan also must be
approved by New York state courts, which Force said he expected to
be easily given.
   Adams estimated that it would take about six years before the
Washington museum's doors open. The memorandum of understanding did
not include a cost estimate, but earlier this year Adams put a
pricetag of more than $150 million on the entire undertaking.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, who was a principal architect
of the agreement, said he would introduce legislation this week to
authorize the startup.
