   A Concorde, the world's only supersonic
airliner, will be given to the Smithsonian Institution's National
Air and Space Museum under an agreement to be signed Sunday between
the museum and Air France.
   The Smithsonian said the gift will be made within the next
decade as some of the planes, which began commercial service in
1976, are retired.
   More than 203 feet long, the Concorde will occupy a prominent
space in the museum's annex, due to be built at Dulles
International Airport about 20 miles outside Washington. The air
and space museum is the city's biggest tourist attraction.
