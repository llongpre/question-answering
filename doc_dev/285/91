<TEXT>     Boatwright's materials will join the museum's Duke Ellington Collection,
which was established in 1988 and which includes 200,000 pages of documents,
500 audio tapes, 77 scrapbooks and more than 2,000 photographs obtained from
the jazz composer's son, Mercer Ellington.;   The latest hoard cost $275,000
and was paid for by private funds. The earlier acquisition was made possible
by $800,000 in appropriations from Congress, which designated the Smithsonian
museum as the central repository for Ellington materials.  </TEXT>
