<LEADPARA>  THINK of pasta without tomato sauce, polenta without cornmeal, pommes
soufflees without potatoes, ratatouille without peppers and mousse without
chocolate. What you'd have is European cooking without Columbus.;   Some will
argue that what the Old World brought to the New World -- apples, pears,
peaches, milk and sugar cane, not to mention livestock -- was equally
significant, but culinary scholars tend to think the Europeans got the better
deal.  </LEADPARA>

(For years, they were afraid to eat the tomato.);   Last month, the
Smithsonian Institution began its commemoration of the 500th anniversary of
Columbus' voyage with a reception that featured dishes from the Old and the
New Worlds before 1492. (These days, commemoration, not celebration, is the
politically correct term.);   Unlike other aspects of the quincentenary, there
isn't a lot of politics attached to chocolate and peppers. "Food is one of the
few safe grounds," said Katherine Kirlin, the special coordinator for the
reception. "No scholars have called for revisions of food thoughts.";  
Indeed. Only a culinary churl would complain about the Italians getting the
tomato.;   Yet historians who study geopolitics do not award the tomato the
importance it enjoys among culinary historians. For them, the clout belongs to
potatoes, corn and sugar.;   "Potatoes and corn are more important to the diet
because of nutrition and calories," said Carolyn Margolis, assistant director
of quincentenary programs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural
History.;   She helped organize the museum's exhibition called "Seeds of
Change," which opens on Oct. 26. "Sugar is important because it was the first
major commodity that resulted in the plantation economy, slavery and the
destruction of the rain forest," she said. "It continues to be political
because of the migrant labor that is used to grow it.;   "The true treasures
of the New World were not gold, but botanicals.";   Anyone who cooks would not
argue with her assessment. But 500 years later it's hard to keep straight what
came from where.;   The food now called Tex-Mex would not have existed without
the arrival of cattle (and by extension, cow's milk) from Europe.;   And if
you want to be absolutely accurate, you would say "as American as blueberry
pie," because blueberries are indigenous, while the Europeans brought the
apple.;   The "Seeds of Change" exhibition was created to make its viewers
aware of these contributions. "I don't think most people know how much has
been contributed," Margolis said. "Food unites us and helps us appreciate
other cultures."; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; As a companion to the exhibition, a
handsome new book, "Seeds of Change" by Herman J. Viola and Margolis
(Smithsonian Institution Press; cloth, $39.95; paper, $24.95), tells the same
story with evocative photographs and inviting prose.  </TEXT>
