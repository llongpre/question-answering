   A two-headed shrimp a fisherman found in
his bait bucket appears to be the first such specimen on record,
experts say.
   ``We're dealing with a first occurrence here, I guess, to the
best of our knowledge,'' said Neal Baxter, chief of the National
Marine Fisheries Service ecology division in Galveston.
   The shrimp has been sent to the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington.
   Howard Fraley, 37 and his wife, C.J., were fishing near
Galveston last May when Fraley dipped into his bait bucket and came
out with the oddity.
   ``I said: `Why, this thing's got two heads!''' he said.
   The couple photographed the shrimp, then took it home and put it
in their freezer.
   Mrs. Fraley mentioned it to Baxter, who told Austin B. Williams,
a curator of invertebrates at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History.
   ``It was as curious to me as it was to the folks who found it,''
Williams said.
   Williams dissected the shrimp and said both heads appeared
normal in many ways. He has searched scientific literature to the
late 1800s, but has found no mention of a similar case.
   Fraley feels lucky to have found the creature.
   ``I was excited,'' he said. ``And to think I nearly tore the
head off.''
