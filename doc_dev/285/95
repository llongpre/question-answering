<HEAD>Rockport Residents Battle Smithsonian Over Money</HEAD>

   This seaside colony whose charms have
attracted many artists has found itself fighting a court battle
with the Smithsonian Institution over a bequest in a millionaire
sculptor's will.
   Franz Denghausen, the sculptor and poet who lived in Rockport
for 36 years, left $1 million town upon his death to replace the
town's small, turn-of-the-century Carnegie Library.
   But the Smithsonian, which also benefitted from Denghausen's
will, contends the money can only be used to operate the new
library, after the town uses its own money to build it.
   The existing one-story library building is overcrowded with
books, and lacks space for additional collections granted in memory
of Denghausen's wife, Luisita. So the town wants to use
Denghausen's bequest to convert a former elementary school into a
new library.
   The town library trustees contend the Smithsonian is attempting
to block the building of the library so it can obtain the town's $1
million. The Smithsonian already is expected to receive $4 million
to $5 million from the Denghausen estate. It also received $3.8
million from Luisita Denghausen's estate after she died on Jan. 19,
1986.
   The issue is now before an Essex County Probate Court.
Denghausen, who was childless, died Oct. 17, 1987.
   The Smithsonian and town library trustees disagree over the
interpretation of a passage from Denghausen's will that said the
money is intended ``for the purpose of providing an adequate
replacement for the now obsolete Carnegie Library.''
   The will said the money would be granted ``provided that the
town contribute the land upon which such a library is to be erected
or provide the funds for the renovation of some building now owned
by the town....''
   Residents at the December 1988 Town Meeting voted to give a
former elementary school land and building to the trustees for
conversion to a library. Residents also voted to spend $15,000 on
plans for the new library.
   Town officials said that without the $1 million from Denghausen,
the town cannot afford a new library.
   ``At this point, the Smithsonian is vigorously trying to prevent
the town of Rockport from being able to accept this gift,'' said
Ted Reed, chairman of the Rockport Library trustees.
   But Elaine Johnston, the institution's assistant general
counsel, defended the Smithsonian's action.
   ``The actions proposed by the town seem inconsistent with the
terms imposed by Mr. Denghausen, and the Smithsonian feels a
responsibility to ensure that his wishes are carried out,'' she
said.
   The state Attorney General's public charities division supports
the town.
   ``The overall purpose of the gift is to provide a replacement
for the now obsolete library, not for subsequent operating
expenses,'' the office of Attorney General James Shannon wrote.
   ``Frankly, we do not understand why the Smithsonian has chosen
to take such an adversarial position. It does not seem right that
such a large, federally supported, national institution is trying
to prevent a small town from upgrading its public library,'' said
Reed.
   The Smithsonian's annual budget is $225 million from the federal
government and $91 million from trust funds. The Rockport library's
annual budget is $147,000.
