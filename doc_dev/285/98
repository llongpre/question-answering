<LEADPARA>  The Smithsonian Institution's board of regents Monday endorsed a plan to
convert the century-old Arts and Industries Building on the Mall into a
National African American Museum. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said the
Smithsonian's decision would give a big boost to legislation he and other
black House members have been pushing for four years to establish a national
showcase for African American history and culture.;    He thinks Congress now
will approve the idea within a year. "The go-ahead signal of the board of
regents is a significant step," Lewis said. "The climate is right for it."
Proponents of the plan now hope to convince Congress to help with the cost of
renovating the building. No figure has been mentioned. They also must begin
assembling a museum collection.  </LEADPARA>
