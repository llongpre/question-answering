<LEADPARA>  The proposal before us is the creation of the National African American Museum
at the Smithsonian Institution, and the director of that project is Claudine
Brown, who posed for this shot in Washington. Her job is to travel to the
country's cities in search of artifacts reflecting the history of black
Americans. If enough of such items can be gathered, the Smithsonian is
expected to give its stamp of approval to the new museum.  </LEADPARA>
