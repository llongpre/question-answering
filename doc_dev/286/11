Boots yesterday shrugged off problems at its pharmaceuticals and DIY
businesses to beat the best City forecasts with a 19 per cent increase in
underlying profits.
After exceptional charges of Pounds 68.5m, relating mainly to withdrawal of
the Manoplax heart drug and restructuring of the Do It All DIY joint
venture, pre-tax profits increased 2.6 per cent from Pounds 405.2m to Pounds
415.9m.
Before the charges, pre-tax profits were Pounds 484.4m - some Pounds 20m
higher than consensus forecasts - on turnover which increased 5.2 per cent
to Pounds 4.17bn.
Buoyed by a proposed final dividend of 10.1p, lifting the total pay-out 12
per cent to 15p, the shares gained 22p to 527p.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said Boots was reaping the benefits of
developing its own brand and vertical integration.
A higher proportion of own-label sales helped Boots the Chemists again to
lift its operating margin - from 10.7 per cent to 11.5 per cent - with
operating profits increasing from Pounds 285m to Pounds 322.9m. Boots
Contract Manufacturing, the cosmetics and healthcare business which sells
almost two-thirds of its output to Boots the Chemists, in turn raised
profits nearly a quarter to Pounds 16.2m.
Own-label sales were also growing at Halfords and Boots Opticians, which
both lifted profits, and at Children's World and Do It All which reduced
their losses. Boots and partners WH Smith are selling 100 Do It All stores,
reducing the chain to 140.
The prescription drugs business, Boots Pharmaceuticals, raised profits from
Pounds 91.4m to Pounds 94.2m in spite of the failure of Manoplax, but Sir
James said the strategic review of the business was continuing. He confirmed
that a merchant bank was assessing merger and sale opportunites.
'This is a complex process and we won't be rushed,' he said. 'All options
remain open. The only thing that has been ruled out is carrying on as we
are.'
Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs division, more
than doubled operating profits to Pounds 6.6m.
Sir James is keen to expand Healthcare International through acquisitions
and has the cash to do so. Boots transformed Pounds 203.8m debts into net
cash of Pounds 69m - before Pounds 94m proceeds from the sale last week of
Farleys baby foods to HJ Heinz - in spite of record capital spending of
Pounds 224m. Much of that went on the retail businesses, with Boots the
Chemists adding 48 smaller stores.
Boots Properties raised profits by almost a quarter to Pounds 67.1m.
Earnings per share, after exceptional items, increased from 27p to 27.7p.
