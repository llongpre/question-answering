FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Boots takes heart from licence agreement

MANOPLAX, Boots' congestive heart failure treatment that received its first
licence yesterday, probably represents the British group's last chance of a
meaningful presence in the lucrative pharmaceuticals industry.
While Boots' turnover is dominated by retailing, the pharmaceuticals
division generated an operating profit of Pounds 120m last year, 32 per cent
of the group total.
The success of Manoplax is vital to the division because most of its
existing products are off-patent and therefore vulnerable to cheap generic
competition. Meanwhile, its pipeline of new medicines - other than Manoplax
 -appears unpromising.
Boots' pharmaceuticals business is a minnow compared with the industry's
giants. It risks not having the critical mass to develop and successfully
market new medicines on a regular basis.
'We are betting heavily on Manoplax. It is a very important drug capable of
reshaping the whole business,' said Mr Terry Richardson, international and
marketing managing director. The drug could eventually generate sales of
between Pounds 100m and Pounds 300m a year.
Yesterday's licence is a relief for Boots after repeated delays led to
analysts describing the drug as 'Mananaplax'. However, some are less
confident than Boots about Manoplax's potential sales and ability to
transform its drugs business.
Doubts exist about European demand for the product. Worldwide sales of
Ace-inhibitors, the main class of competitor to Manoplax, are about Dollars
500m (Pounds 262m) a year.
But although Merck, the US drug giant, has thrown vast resources at
marketing Vasotec, its best-selling Ace-inhibitor, in Europe, only 5 per
cent of European patients are prescribed such medicines.
'If Merck with all its marketing muscle finds it difficult to overcome
European doctors' conservatism, what hope has Boots?' asked one analyst.
To overcome its marketing weakness in Europe, Boots has signed co-marketing
agreements for Germany with Astra, the Swedish group, and plans to sign a
similar agreement with an Italian group. It aims to market the drug directly
to hospital specialists in France, the UK and Spain and plans to invest
Pounds 20m in additional marketing infrastructure this year.
Manoplax's ultimate success will be decided in the US, the world's largest
single market. About 25 per cent of the 3m congestive heart disease patients
are prescribed Ace-inhibitors there.
However, analysts fear Manoplax will only be used in the US as a
second-choice treatment when Ace-inhibitors fail. Last October the FDA's
cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee recommended the drug for
approval, but only in patients who still had symptoms after using
Ace-inhibitors or were intolerant to alternative therapies.
Mr Richardson hoped that data from recent clinical trials would enable wider
approval to be gained, possibly making it a first-line treatment.
Analysts believe that a successful launch for Manoplax could offer an ideal
opportunity for Boots to withdraw from prescription pharmaceuticals. It
could sell at a moment of maximum potential, while avoiding the full brunt
of marketing costs.
The group could then concentrate on its strengths in retailing and
over-the-counter medicines.
