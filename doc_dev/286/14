   Women shouldn't throw out their thyroid prescriptions even though a commonly prescribed hormone may cause some long-term thinning of the bones, a doctor said. 

   The most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone, L-thyroxine, previously had been considered safe when taken over a number of years, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 

   But 31 young women treated with L-thyroxine for at least five years were found to have 10% to 13% less bone density in their hips than 31 women in a comparison group matched for age and weight, the study said. 

   Loss of bone mass, also called osteoporosis, is usually most serious in women after menopause and is largely to blame for the hip fractures that afflict one-third of women who reach age 90, the study said. 

   But one of the authors, Dr. Lewis E. Braverman, cautioned that the study is only preliminary, and said, "We don't know, and we are not suggesting, that these very small changes in hip (bone density) will be associated with an increased fracture rate." 

   "We are not saying thyroid hormone should not be used because it causes bone loss," said Dr. Braverman, of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. 
"We are saying the dose of Lthyroxine should be carefully adjusted to the individual need of the patient, which can now be done with sensitive new assays." 

   Before new tests were developed about two years ago to measure precise blood levels of L-thyroxine, marketed as Levothroid and Synthroid, doctors were more likely to prescribe excess levels, Dr. Braverman said. 

   Most of the millions of patients who take it must do so indefinitely to counteract the hormone deficiency created by an underactive thyroid gland, thyroid cancer or a condition known as goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid that leads to a swelling of the neck. 

   Hypothyroidism causes body functions to slow down and, if untreated, can lead to a deterioration in a person's physical and mental health. 
The problem can become so severe that simple mental tasks, such as adding up a bill, take longer. 

   "One of the risks in something (a finding) like this is you have people say, 'I'm going to stop taking my thyroid so I won't get osteoporosis.' 
That's disastrous," Dr. Braverman said. 

   But an editorial accompanying the study in the journal suggested that doctors might need to rethink their approach to treating thyroid hormone deficiencies. 

   "Is it appropriate to treat a benign thyroid problem with a medication that potentially could cause osteoporosis?" said the editorial, by Dr. David S. Cooper of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. 

   "The whole concept of suppression therapy for benign thyroid disease may need reevaluation, especially in older women, whose skeletons are the most likely to be in jeopardy," he said. 

   The study found no loss of bone mass in the spine, the doctors said. 
Spinal bone loss can cause the reduction in height and back curvature that mark advanced cases of osteoporosis.
