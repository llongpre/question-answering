   Women should not throw out their thyroid
prescriptions even though a commonly prescribed hormone may cause
some long-term thinning of the bones, a doctor says.
   The most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone, L-thyroxine,
previously had been considered safe when taken over a number of
years, says a study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   But 31 young women treated with L-thyroxine for at least five
years were found to have 10 percent to 13 percent less bone density
in their hips than 31 women in a comparison group matched for age
and weight, the study said.
   Loss of bone mass, also called osteoporosis, is usually most
serious in women after menopause and is largely to blame for the
hip fractures that afflict one-third of women who reach age 90, the
study said.
   But one of the authors cautioned that the study is only
preliminary and ``we don't know, and we are not suggesting, that
these very small changes in hip will be associated with an
increased fracture rate.''
   ``We are not saying thyroid hormone should not be used because
it causes bone loss,'' said the co-author, Dr. Lewis E. Braverman
of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.
   ``We are saying the dose of L-thyroxine should be carefully
adjusted to the individual need of the patient, which can now be
done with sensitive new assays,'' he added in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   Before new tests were developed about two years ago to measure
precise blood levels of L-thyroxine, marketed as Levothroid and
Synthroid, doctors were more likely to prescribe excess levels,
Braverman said.
   Most of the millions of patients who take it must take it
indefinitely to counteract the hormone deficiency created by an
underactive thyroid gland, thyroid cancer or a condition known as
goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid that leads to a swelling of
the neck.
   Hypothyroidism causes body functions to slow down and, if
untreated, can lead to a deterioration in the person's physical and
mental health. The problem can become so severe that simple mental
tasks, such as adding up a bill, take longer.
   ``One of the risks in something (a finding) like this is you
have people say, `I'm going to stop taking my thyroid so I won't
get osteoporosis.' That's disastrous,'' Braverman said.
   But an editorial accompanying the study in the journal suggested
that doctors may need to rethink their approach to treating thyroid
hormone deficiencies.
   ``Is it appropriate to treat a benign thyroid problem with a
medication that potentially could cause osteoporosis?'' asked the
editorial, by Dr. David S. Cooper of Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in Baltimore.
   ``The whole concept of suppression therapy for benign thyroid
disease may need re-evaluation, especially in older women, whose
skeletons are the most likely to be in jeopardy,'' he said.
   The study found no loss of bone mass in the spine, the doctors
said. Spinal bone loss can cause the reduction in height and back
curvature that mark advanced cases of osteoporosis.
