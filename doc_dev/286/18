FT  30 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Price war cools but doubts remain
over drugs division - Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is expected to complete the
latest round of retailers' results on Thursday with an increase in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 406.7m to about Pounds 460m, before Pounds 35m
exceptional charges for withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug.
Boots' shares have enjoyed an easier ride this year than in 1993, when they
lost their premium to the retail sector amid concerns over increasing price
competition with rival Superdrug, and uncertainty over the future of both
the pharmaceuticals business after Manoplax, and Do It All, the loss-making
DIY joint venture with WH Smith.
The price war with Superdrug has cooled somewhat, and uncertainty over Do It
All ended this month when the venture partners said they had agreed to sell
40 stores and planned to sell 60 more, cutting the chain to 140. They
expected it to return to profit in the financial year 1995-96.
Doubt remains, however, about the pharmaceuticals division. Boots has
confirmed that Credit Suisse First Boston is valuing the business, but
insisted it was keeping all options open. Analysts believe Boots would be
unlikely to be able to sell it without diluting earnings.
For the year to March, Goldman Sachs is forecasting increases in operating
profits at Boots the Chemists from Pounds 285m to Pounds 321m, in Boots
Healthcare International from Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m, and Boots Contract
Manufacturing from Pounds 13m to Pounds 16m. The pharmaceuticals division is
expected to decline from Pounds 91m to Pounds 88m.
Boots Opticians is also expected to fall from Pounds 7m to Pounds 5m, but
Children's World is forecast to break even for the first time. Halfords is
expected to improve from Pounds 5m to Pounds 13m.
Boots' share of Do It All losses is forecast to increase from Pounds 14m to
Pounds 15m.
