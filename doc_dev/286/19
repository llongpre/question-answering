FT  27 APR 93 / Boots reveals death risk of heart drug

THE Boots Company, the UK retailer and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday
revealed that Manoplax, its heart drug, can lead to significantly higher
mortality.
The revelation is a severe blow for the company's pharmaceuticals division,
whose executives have described the medicine as one of the last hopes for
the drugs operation.
Mr Terry Richardson, international and marketing director said last year:
'We are betting heavily on Manoplax. It is a very important drug capable of
reshaping the whole business.' Manoplax was predicted as potentially
eventually generating sales of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 300m a year.
Boots said sales of the drug, launched in the UK last September and in the
US this March, had been far above expectations.
The company said preliminary results from a clinical trial involving 3,500
patients in the US, Canada and Sweden, had suggested that patients with
severe congestive heart failure taking 100mg of Manoplax a day had a
'significantly increased risk of death compared with those not receiving the
drug'.
Boots would not say how large the increase in mortality had been, nor would
it state when the results of the trial, called the Profile study, would be
published. It said the full analysis of the data, which might show if the
increased mortality had been among a sub-set of patients, would be known in
two to three weeks.
'We have had a very difficult couple of days with the US and British
regulatory authorities which have different views about the significance of
the trial,' said Mr Alastair Eperon, director of corporate affairs at Boots.
The company said the data did not suggest there was an increased risk of
death at a dose of 75mg. It said the company had every confidence in the
future prospects of Manoplax.
Boots has been forced to write to all US, Canadian, Scandinavian and British
physicians who might prescribe the drug, warning them not to use the 100mg
dose.
Manoplax has been dogged by controversy.
Delays before it was licensed were so long that the medicine was dubbed by
analysts 'Mananaplax'.
