business

Boots is to end 80 years of prescription medicine manufacture with the sale
of its drugs business to BASF of Germany for 'about Pounds 850m'.
The proposed deal, still subject to contract discussions, ends speculation
over Boots' intentions. Its decision commits the UK company to developing as
a retailer, after trying to combine healthcare with shopkeeping.
Conversely, as BASF's biggest purchase in healthcare, the deal reinforces
the German chemicals group's commitment to expansion in drugs.
In global terms, however, the deal is relatively small. The combined
business would be about 30th in the world in terms of sales in the
pharmaceuticals sector, about 10 places ahead of their current standing.
BASF said yesterday the rationale was 'both therapeutic and geographic'.
Boots is strong in the US, UK and Commonwealth countries while BASF is best
placed in continental Europe.
BASF also wants Boots' expertise in nervous system drugs. Boots has licences
to develop two such drugs with projected launch dates at the end of the
decade. Until then, BASF will have to make do with an old and small product
portfolio.
Most of Boots' prescription drug sales and profits come from Synthroid, a
thyroid drug available only in the US. which had first-half sales of Dollars
117m (Pounds 73.1m) - outside the world's top 100 bestsellers. Synthroid,
like other Boots products, has no patent protection.
In the first half of 1994, Boots achieved prescription drugs sales of Pounds
226m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 49.8m.
Boots put its prescription drugs business up for sale when adverse
side-effects forced it in July 1993 to abandon its most promising drug, the
heart treatment Manoplax.
It has had talks with several drugs companies in recent months, including
Zeneca and Medeva of the UK, but no agreement was reached on price.
By last week, only BASF and a management buy-out team were left in the
running. The buy-out team yesterday refused to give up the chase, saying it
awaited the outcome of the final contract negotiations.
BASF and its German rivals Bayer and Hoechst have made a string of drug
sector purchases in the past year in an effort to increase their activities
outside the German domestic market, the largest in Europe.
