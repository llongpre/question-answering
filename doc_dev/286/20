MANOPLAX, the cardiovascular drug whose success is vital for the credibility
of Boots' pharmaceuticals drug research, received its first licence
yesterday. UK regulators said the medicine, developed by the British retail
and healthcare group, could be used to treat congestive heart failure.
The UK pharmaceutical market is only the fourth largest in Europe but the
announcement is significant because it demonstrates that Boots has overcome
regulators' fears about the drug's safety and effectiveness. Early clinical
studies suggested Manoplax was ineffective. Boots shares rose 7p to 429p.
'There is little else more important for the Boots' pharmaceuticals business
than Manoplax. This is its first new drug for a long time and the division
will depend on Manoplax to drive growth in the 1990s,' said Mr Paul
Krickler, pharmaceuticals analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Manoplax could generate revenues of between Dollars 100m (Pounds 52m) and
Dollars 150m by 1995, assuming swift US approval, said Mr Krickler. The
pharmaceuticals division's turnover last year was Pounds 699m, generating
operating profits of Pounds 120m, nearly a third of Boots' Pounds 374m
pre-tax earnings.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said: 'We confidently look forward to
receiving further registration approvals in most major markets in the coming
months.'
The company said it expected to have US approval by the end of its financial
year in March.
