FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Boots pulls up its margins - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>

It was ironic that Boots' surprisingly good results this week - a 19 per
cent increase in underlying profits to Pounds 484m - should come a day after
a disappointing trading statement from rival group Kingfisher. It
demonstrated how retailers' fortunes - and market sentiment - can change in
a year.
This time last year, rivalry between Boots and Kingfisher - and in
particular between Boots the Chemists and Kingfisher's Superdrug - was seen
as a microcosm of a wider clash of retailing philosophies for the 1990s.
Kingfisher advocated a strategy of reducing profit margins to increase sales
volumes and market share, adopting a policy of 'Everyday Low Pricing'.
Boots stuck to the margin-led approach, which says growing profits is all
about constantly engineering the profit margins upwards.
In the first half of 1993, Boots' shares underperformed the market by 25 per
cent, losing their premium to the stores sector, while Kingfisher's
advanced. Price-cutting by Superdrug aroused fears that margins at Boots the
Chemists - responsible for 60 per cent of Boots group's operating profits -
were under threat.
The picture a year on is rather different. Kingfisher's shares have slumped
from 778p last December to 516p, after two disappointing trading statements,
and results suggesting its margin sacrifices were not being compensated for
by volume increases - at least not yet.
Boots' shares have also fallen since December, but by much less, and at 525p
are on a considerably higher rating.
Results from Boots the Chemists on Thursday showed it had withstood
competition from Superdrug, and pushed up its operating margin yet again,
from 10.7 to 11.5 per cent. That has more than doubled from 5 per cent in
the mid-1980s, and is getting into territory previously occupied only by
Marks and Spencer.
BTC reported a sales increase for the year to March 31 of 5.4 per cent;
Superdrug a fall in sales in the first quarter of 0.7 per cent.
The reasons for the reversal of fortunes are complex. But while it is too
early to write off Kingfisher chairman Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy's 'value
retailing' approach, Boots' success does suggest the Mulcahy way is not the
only way.
Boots, however, differs in important ways from Kingfisher. First, it has the
advantage when it comes to pushing up margins of vertical integration. Some
43 per cent of Boots the Chemists' sales are own-label, which earn a higher
margin as the retailer can buy them more cheaply than manufacturers' brands.
Much of that own-label product comes from Boots' own cosmetics and
healthcare factories, now grouped in a separate division, Boots Contract
Manufacturing. BCM sells 60 per cent of its output to Boots the Chemists -
and lifted operating profits nearly a quarter last year.
Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs division, also
supplies Boots the Chemists with big-sellers such as Optrex, Strepsils and
Nurofen. Healthcare International more than doubled its profits and is
earmarked for expansion.
A second difference is that a question mark hangs over one of Boots' main
divisions - pharmaceuticals - and several of its retail chains are in rather
worse shape than Kingfisher's.
The withdrawal last year of heart drug Manoplax robbed Boots Pharmaceuticals
of annual sales which analysts had forecast might reach Pounds 166m and left
it too small to compete in a rapidly-consolidating global drugs industry.
Boots is reviewing its future and examining sale, merger or asset-swap
possibilities.
The performance of the other retail businesses, especially those acquired in
the 1989 take-over of Ward White, is patchy. Rationalisation of the DIY
joint venture Do It All should reduce losses, and Halfords is recovering
strongly. But Children's World and Fads made losses, and the task is still
to raise the performance of these businesses to acceptable levels.
Investors might be cautious of Boots until the future of the pharmaceuticals
business is resolved - analysts fear a sale might be earnings-dilutive. It
would, however add to Boots' Pounds 150m cash pile, providing opportunities
for expansion, for example of Healthcare International.
Boots also says it has 'no philosophical objection' to handing cash back to
shareholders. Either way, Boots' success in confounding its critics during a
tough period suggests it is likely to remain one of the market's more solid
long-term performers.
