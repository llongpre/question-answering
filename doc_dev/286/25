<LEADPARA>  LIKE to go barefoot on the beach? Not so fast. The sun isn't the only thing
that can unsettle you by the seaside. According to the American Orthopedic
Foot and Ankle Society, the biggest troublemakers for fresh-water beachgoers
are broken glass, rusty nails, pop-tops from drink cans and sharp rocks on the
shore. Up-to-date tetanus immunization is a must. At seaside beaches, coral
reefs, sea urchins and poisonous fish can give you a sting. Proper footwear,
please.;     Babies and cavities  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     One of the best ways to practice good oral hygiene for your baby is to make
sure that he or she doesn't fall asleep with a bottle. According to the
Academy of General Dentistry, nursing-bottle syndrome is a condition that
causes severe decay in baby teeth when the lactose in milk and fructose in
juice combine with the bacteria in baby's mouth. The condition affects up to 6
percent of children under age 4.;    When not to switch;  People who are
stabilized on certain brand-name drugs should not change to a generic, says
pharmacist Gordon McGuire of the University of California Medical Center in
San Diego. Drugs that should not be switched from brand name to generic
include: Digoxin, a cardiac medication; Coumadin, an anticoagulant; Synthroid,
a thyroid-hormone replacement; and Dilantic, an anticonvulsant.;    Singing
and walking;  Ever wonder if you're walking with enough pep in your step? All
you have to do is try to sing while you walk. If you can belt out a tune while
you're walking, you most likely aren't working hard enough to benefit your
heart and lungs. If you're so winded, you can't even chat, you're walking too
fast. That's according to Prevention magazine.  </TEXT>
