BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, said yesterday it was
considering all options for the future of its drugs division, but had no
plans to sell it after withdrawal of Manoplax, its heart drug.
The company said: 'We would be expected to consider all the options
following the withdrawal of Manoplax, but we are not leaning towards one
option or another at this stage.' The drugs division has been widely seen as
too small to be viable.
Mr Gordon Solway, managing director of the drugs arm, will lead the
executive committee in a thorough review of the business plan it put
together before the withdrawal of Manoplax. Boots said: 'We are reviewing
the whole business plan for the pharmaceuticals business. It is not
something that can just be tweaked.'
Boots said the move would cost Pounds 35m in stock write-offs and
'provisions against manufacturing facilities'. It said there would be no
closures at the two sites making Manoplax - Nottingham and Cramlington,
Northumberland. Job losses, however, could not be ruled out. The company
said it would save on marketing expenses for the drug, which last year cost
Pounds 20m, and on research and development.
Boots also denied plans to sell its loss-making DIY chain, Do It All, a
joint venture with WH Smith. It argued that Boots was well-placed
financially to wait for the potential gains from a 'profits bounce back' as
the recession ended.
