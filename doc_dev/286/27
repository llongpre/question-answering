A Pounds 35m CHARGE to cover the cost of withdrawing the heart drug Manoplax
pushed interim profits at Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group,
down 6 per cent to Pounds 174.6m.
There was a further Pounds 14m charge in Boots Pharmaceuticals division to
cover redundancy costs and the completion of clinical trials, although there
were matching savings on aborted research and marketing costs. Boots also
wrote off Pounds 5.1m relating to Asilone, an antacid product purchased for
Pounds 12.5m, following a review of brand strategy. Sir James Blyth, chief
executive, said Boots was conducting a 'fundamental reappraisal' of its
pharmaceuticals business following the withdrawal of Manoplax and no options
were ruled out. He refused to say when this might be completed. 'This is not
something we are going to rush.'
He was confident Boots' gross margins, which increased 0.5 points in the
first half, would not be affected by the escalation in price competition
between UK grocery retailers. Boots' strength, he said, was its own-label
products, which accounted for about 45 per cent of sales. 'That means our
ability to protect our margins is greater. It gives us the opportunity to
price tactically when we need to.'
Group turnover increased from Pounds 1.85bn to Pounds 1.99bn in the six
months to September 30, in spite of what Boots called 'dull market
conditions'.
Exceptional items pushed Boots Pharmaceuticals' profit down to Pounds 2.1m
from Pounds 58.4m last year. Sales increased 9.5 per cent to Pounds 252.8m,
but when adjusted for devaluation of sterling, they fell 2.8 per cent. There
was further bad news at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with WH Smith,
where Boot's share of losses increased from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 7.9m, on
sales down from Pounds 113.1m to Pounds 107.4m. Elsewhere, the outlook was
brighter. Boots the Chemists lifted sales 5.8 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, and
profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 132.7m, while profits at Halfords, the
motor accessories chain, almost quadrupled to Pounds 5.8m from sales up 9.6
per cent to Pounds 174.1m.
The overall figures also included an exceptional gain of Pounds 9.8m on the
disposal of Sephora, the French perfumes chain, and Boots print packaging
business.
The interim dividend was lifted from 4.6 to 4.9p, although the exceptional
charges resulted in an 8 per cent fall in earnings to 11.5p. Stripping out
exceptionals, the results were broadly in line with forecasts, and Boots
shares gained 6p to 511p.
