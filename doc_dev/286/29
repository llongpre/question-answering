FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Boots plans European purchases

Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday revealed it was
planning a series of acquisitions on mainland Europe to bolster its
ambitions in the European over-the-counter non-prescription medicines
market.
Mr Barry Clare, managing director of Boots Healthcare International, the
group's OTC division, said Boots was looking to build its businesses in
France, Italy and Spain in the coming years, possibly through acquisition.
It also plans to acquire a business in Germany, where Boots has no presence.
'We've already quite an extensive European network - in fact we think we're
three years ahead of the opposition in our strategic thinking - but we've
still got some gaps to fill,' said Mr Clare.
Mr David Thompson, group finance director, said: 'OTC will be one of the
main engines of growth for Boots in the coming years.' He claimed that
typical margins in the OTC business were about 15 per cent.
Boots' OTC division has not achieved that - last year it generated profits
of only Pounds 6.6m on sales of Pounds 155.3m. However, Mr Thompson said
that was because the company was investing heavily in the division.
The company hopes to use its distribution and regulatory skills to create
pan-European brands, repeating the success of products such as Strepsils,
the cough and cold product.
By doing so, Boots hopes to compete effectively in the rapidly growing
European OTC market. 'The market is expanding fast both in the UK and on the
Continent and that rate of growth could accelerate.
The company estimates the OTC market was worth about Pounds 8.1bn in 1992
and could reach Pounds 12bn by the end of the decade.
The OTC market is being driven by cash-strapped governments. These are
encouraging the switch of prescription only products to OTC status. In
effect, the patient, rather than the healthcare system, pays for the
medicine.
The large number of drugs losing patent protection over the next few years
would mean there was a large number of candidates for such switches,
explained Mr Clare.
Although Boots was only number 12 in the European OTC market, the sector
remained highly fragmented with the top 12 groups accounting for only 25 per
cent of the market. There would be rapid consolidation, said Mr Clare.
Boots also hoped to obtain new products from pharmaceuticals companies whose
prescription drugs are soon scheduled to lose their patent protection.
'We are talking to two companies about products in our core product areas
(skincare, analgesics, cough/cold, eyecare). One approached us, and the
other we went to twice, before the group came back to us,' said Mr Clare. He
refused to say which companies or which therapeutic areas were involved.
