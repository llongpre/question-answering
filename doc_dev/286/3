FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sale is likely drugs prescription - Tim
Burt considers Boots' plans for its pharmaceuticals side

Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is likely to face tough
questions next week on its strategy from an unexpected quarter - its own
managers.
Senior staff from the pharmaceuticals division will meet head office
executives ostensibly to review the company's first-half performance. But
the year-long review of the drugs business is likely to overshadow the
proceedings.
Managers conducting the review, prompted by the withdrawal last year of the
heart drug Manoplax at a cost of almost Pounds 40m, have considered selling
the business, launching a joint venture or retaining it in a radically
restructured form.
While reluctant to indicate the group's favoured option, Mr Gordon Solway,
managing director of Boots Pharmaceuticals, warned yesterday that job losses
were inevitable.
'Whatever happens, there are bound to be redundancies in research and
development in Nottingham.'
In what may be seen as a blow to the city, he added that Boots had not asked
potential bidders to maintain a presence in the East Midlands as a condition
of any acquisition.
Of the possible options, a disposal has looked increasingly likely in recent
months following the group's decision to issue a sales memorandum and hire
Credit Suisse First Boston as financial advisers.
A number of companies have been linked with the division, which offers
laboratory and sales expertise in the the UK and a marketing and
distribution network in North America, the world's largest pharmaceuticals
market.
Zeneca, Britain's third largest drugs group, is thought to have examined the
business, but was put off by the asking price. Medeva has also ruled itself
out, leaving analysts' attention focused on continental European bidders.
They have identified three possible suitors: Knoll, part of the German BASF;
Menarini of Italy; and Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group.
Yesterday, however, Astra denied having any interest while its German and
Italian rivals refused to comment.
Nevertheless, a consensus has emerged among City analysts on Boots'
long-term intentions. Their scenario envisages the pharmaceuticals business
being sold for more than Pounds 700m, greatly strengthening the group's cash
resources.
Profits on the disposal could help fund a share buy-back, which would
reassure investors frustrated by the dilutive effect of the Pounds 900m Ward
White acquisition in 1989.
Analysts suggest the company might then feel confident enough to acquire an
over-the-counter drugs business in continental Europe, preferably in
Germany, for about Pounds 500m.
Mr Solway said although no decisions had been reached, senior managers in
the pharmaceuticals division were under no illusions about the review
process.
'They recognise that their prospects are better if we were to change hands
and become part of a major pharmaceuticals player.'
He denied, however, that the uncertainty over the division had harmed its
performance.
Buoyant demand for Synthroid, the treatment for thyroid deficiency, helped
lift the division's profits by 71 per cent from Pounds 29.2m to Pounds
49.8m.
Research spending has also been maintained and sales have risen from Pounds
215.5m to Pounds 228.1m, although the second half is not expected to be so
healthy because wholesalers stocked up in the first half.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, welcomed the figures. But with most
pharmaceuticals companies facing over-capacity in research and stringent
regulatory hurdles for new drugs, he admitted there was no choice but to
reassess the value of the division.
'We were not alone in having problems and there was no choice but to
reconsider our future in pharmaceuticals. But I don't believe we have
painted ourselves into a corner.'
