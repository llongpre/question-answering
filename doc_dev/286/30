   Warner-Lambert Co. said it entered into an alliance with
Boots Pharmaceuticals Inc. to co-promote two cardiovascular
drugs.
   Under the agreement, one of a growing number of swaps in
the pharmaceutical industry, Warner-Lambert said it would
promote Boots's congestive heart-failure drug Manoplax, while
Boots would promote Warner-Lambert's cholesterol regulator
Lopid. Warner-Lambert added that "additional territory" may
be added to the agreement.

   Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said it
filed a new-drug application for Manoplax with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration in October 1990. Warner-Lambert's
Lopid, a cholesterol regulating drug that reduces the risk of
coronary heart disease, had 1990 worldwide sales of more than
$370 million.
   Boots Pharmaceuticals is a unit of Boots Co. of the United
Kingdom.
