FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bayer plans worldwide generic
drugs chain

Bayer, the German drugs and chemicals company, is planning to set up a chain
of businesses around the world to sell unbranded, generic drugs. Generics is
one of the fastest growing segments of the pharmaceuticals business.
Bayer is creating a joint venture with US generics specialist Schein. This
is the first large deal with Schein since Bayer paid Dollars 310m for a 28.3
per cent stake in March.
Mr David Ebsworth, head of Bayer's worldwide business operations, said the
joint venture would 'be the basis of a global generics business'.
He said that the six months since the stake was taken had showed there was a
need for 'dedicated manpower' to take Schein from its US base to other
countries.
Initially, 10 to 15 people would be employed by the joint venture including
specialists in the launch and marketing of drugs and in finding new
products.
Schein already has a portfolio of more than 400 products, and is especially
strong in central nervous system and heart drugs.
Mr Ebsworth said the company would make a priority of finding new
antibiotics to manufacture and sell.
The acquisition of the Schein stake marked Bayer's entry into generics. The
deal includes provision for the stake to be raised to 51 per cent 'over the
medium term', said Mr Ebsworth.
An increasing number of prescription drug companies is seeing generics as a
business with potential for rapid growth. Many drugs patented in the 1970s
are losing patent protection, opening up the market to companies such as
Schein.
At the same time, governments are encouraging more generics manufacturers in
the hope that increased competition will hold back prices.
Many other prescription drug companies have made a move into generics. Last
month, BASF, Bayer's German rival, diversified its pharmaceuticals division
Knoll into generics for the German market. The move was part of a strategy
developed after Knoll had reported its first loss, and it is now looking for
foreign partners.
Last year, Hoechst, the third of the big three German chemicals companies,
paid Dollars 546m for a 51 per cent stake in Copley Pharmaceuticals, another
US company, and in May this year, Bristol Myers Squibb bought 25 per cent of
Azupharma, a German generics manufacturer.
