Late in 1992, workers at Boots factories in Nottingham found themselves
wearing a new badge on their overalls. The famous blue oval carrying the
Boots name in cursive script was replaced by one sporting two
interconnecting squiggles. At the same time, workers had to get used to the
idea that they were working not for 'Boots', but for a new business unit,
Boots Contract Manufacturing.
The logos were visible signs of important developments in the group -
changes that might have come straight from a modern management textbook, but
which were greeted with suspicion inside and outside the 111-year-old
company.
'There was some cynicism about the business-school speak,' says a company
insider. 'But now people think and speak the new language.'
If the changes are gaining acceptance in the group, Boots' announcement last
month of a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 484m for the
year to March (before exceptional items) helped to convince the outside
world of their effectiveness. In spite of uncertainty surrounding the
pharmaceuticals division, losses at the Do It All DIY chain, and
disappointing performances from other legacies of the Pounds 900m
acquisition of Ward White in 1989, it seemed that chief executive Sir James
Blyth had found a way of unlocking extra value.
Working with Marakon, a Connecticut-based management consultancy, the then
highly centralised Boots group split 18 months ago into 10 business units.
All units have a specified market and competitors, their own management
team, identity and logo.
Each draws up its own profit and loss account, balance sheet and cashflow
statements, and presents an annual 'prospectus' to the group centre
detailing its strategy, and the capital and resources required to fulfil it.
This is discussed with the group chief executive, and becomes a 'strategy
contract' signed by both sides.
The contract includes performance targets that determine unit managers'
incentive payments.
This, says Sir James, marks a big improvement on the practice in many
companies of allocating capital through annual budgetary procedures, where
the amount each division receives often depends on the 'baronial powers of
individuals'.
The group centre, meanwhile, has slimmed to 100 people in seven roles:
personnel, corporate affairs, corporate development, financial management,
information technology, quality control and treasury.
'Boots has tried to create an environment in which the group centre becomes
a shareholder in each business unit, with only a limited range of services.
But it is a demanding shareholder,' says Sir James.
The centre is also responsible for new business development and
restructuring, as well as exploiting synergies, or so-called 'key
affiliation benefits'. These include the transfer of retail skills between
businesses, development of the Boots brand, vertical integration, and the
sharing of information.
Sir James sums up the changes: 'What used to happen at board meetings was
that directors would spend a great deal of time talking about numbers. Now
all the discussion is about strategy.'
The goal of that strategy, as with any public company, is maximising
shareholder value. Boots defines this specifically as 'maximising the
long-term cashflow of each business unit'.
According to Sir James, the concentration on free cashflow reflects a
growing shift by institutional investors from looking at earnings per share.
'There is a much stronger correlation between cashflow per share and market
value than between earnings per share growth and market value,' he suggests.
The new structure at Boots also makes it easier for insiders and outsiders
to assess the contribution of different parts of the business.
While the future of the prescription pharmaceuticals arm is under review
following the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug last year, Boots
Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs arm, and Boots Contract
Manufacturing, which manufactures products for the other two as well as
health and beauty products, are emerging as businesses with great potential.
'Historically, for 25 years, we had been seen as a cost,' says John Watson,
managing director of BCM. 'Now we are seen as a profit.'
BCM's operating profits rose by nearly a quarter last year to Pounds 16.2m,
and as a standalone business it is the third-biggesst manufacturer of its
type in Europe. Eighty per cent of its output goes to other Boots companies,
60 per cent to Boots the Chemists alone. It already makes own-label products
for several of the UK's large grocery retailers, and is keen to expand its
third-party business.
Boots Healthcare International, whose brands include such well-known
products as Optrex, Nurofen and Strepsils, has also been earmarked for
expansion. BHI will concentrate on developing four product groups - cough
and cold remedies, pain relief, eye care and skin care - and plans
acquisitions in France, Italy and Germany.
The dominant business unit, however, remains Boots the Chemists, responsible
for 60 per cent of group operating profits. Its recent results - a 13 per
cent profit rise to Pounds 322m - suggest it is weathering the
everyday-low-pricing strategy operated by Superdrug, which is owned by the
rival Kingfisher group.
The resilience of BTC stems partly from changes wrought by managing director
Gordon Hourston.
In 1986 BTC was in danger of losing its identity and focus, with larger
stores carrying everything from toothpaste to televisions. A wide variation
in store sizes also made functions such as inventory management difficult.
Hourston's solution was to split the business in half, with stores larger
than 600 sq m operating separately. He also divided the central buying and
marketing department into business centres responsible for particular
product areas.
Under Hourston, Boots the Chemists became a pioneer of retail systems and
one of the biggest users of electronic point-of-sale technology in Europe.
These moves helped BTC reduce stockholding and operating costs. They also
increased flexibility, allowing it to respond almost instantly to price
initiatives by competitors, simply by reprogramming its computer, rather
than having sales assistants alter prices by hand. Till sales information
allows BTC to determine the profit contribution of all products and stop or
reduce unprofitable lines - one famous example being pet food.
Mistakes were made - Boots sometimes overlooked the fact that an
unprofitable product might nevertheless be attracting shoppers to the store.
But the final result was a more focused range, with the positioning and
shelf space of each product in each store controlled by a computer system
called Spaceman.
Another important strategy has been the development of the Boots brand.
Own-label products are important as they cost retailers less than
proprietary brands, and so carry a bigger profit margin or the same cash
profit at a lower price. Own-label products now account for 43 per cent of
BTC's sales - one-third of them made by Boots Contract Manufacturing.
George Charters, director of merchandise and marketing, divides own-label
into three categories:
Basic products, such as shampoo, which compete with rivals' own-label
products.
Brand competitors, such as the shampoo-and-conditioner Duo, designed to
compete with proprietary brands, but at prices 5 to 10 per cent cheaper.
Value-added products, such as the global and natural collections, which
compete with rival retailer Body Shop.
Charters says the third area, which has the highest margin, is the fastest
growing. That means operating margins, which have more than doubled from 5
per cent in 1985 to 11.5 per cent last year, should still have room for
growth.
There is also scope for physical growth. BTC has identified 240 potential
sites for more small stores, and it has a pilot programme of opening shops
within superstores operated by J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery
retailer.
The hope now is that Boots the Chemists' retailing skills can be passed to
the group's less successful retail chains - Halfords, Children's World,
Fads, and Do It All.
A longer-term aspiration is that countries such as France, perhaps under
pressure from the European Commission, might relax restrictions on companies
holding multiple pharmacy licences, allowing Boots the Chemists to take its
business overseas.
