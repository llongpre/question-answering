FT  27 NOV 92 / People: Shuffle in HSBC boardroom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank, has been appointed a
non-executive deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings, replacing John Gray who is
stepping down as an executive deputy chairman in order to concentrate on his
new job as chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
Sir Peter's promotion follows HSBC's acquisition of Midland earlier this
year and, while not unexpected, is part of a boardroom reshuffle which means
that Midland directors will hold a quarter of the seats on HSBC's 20-strong
board.
Sir Peter, 61, who was chairman of BP for eight years until March 1990, is
being joined on the HSBC board by Sir Colin Marshall (left), 59, chief
executive of British Airways, and Geoffrey Maitland Smith (right), also 59,
chairman of Sears. Richard Delbridge, a former JP Morgan banker who only
joined Midland three years ago, is joining the HSBC board as executive
director finance.
It was originally intended that Sir Patrick Meaney, the chairman of Rank
Organisation and one of Midland's longest serving directors, would go on the
HSBC board, but he died some months ago. In addition Brian Goldthorpe, who
had represented Midland on the HSBC board since 1991, also died recently.
Meanwhile, Nigel Rich, managing director of Jardine Matheson Holdings, and
John Swaine, deputy president of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, will step
down as non-executive directors of HSBC Holdings but will remain on the
board of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. John Gray will remain on the
HSBC board.

Eric Cliffe (above), Boots Pharmaceuticals' managing director, is to retire
next month after 33 years with The Boots Company. He is not being directly
replaced; the organisation he headed has been divided into three separate
units: Boots Pharmaceuticals, Boots Healthcare International and Boots
Contract Manufacturing.
Barry Clare has been appointed managing director of Boots Healthcare
International which is responsible for Boots' European consumer products.
Meanwhile, John Watson has been made managing director of Boots Contract
Manufacturing which supplies Boots The Chemists.
Gordon Solway is now managing director of Boots pharmaceuticals as well as a
main board director of The Boots Company. He faces the difficult job of
overseeing the international launch of Manoplax, a heart treatment vital to
the company's hopes of remaining a credible drugs group. Boots expects the
medicine to be approved in the US, the world's largest market, by the end of
this financial year next March.
