BOOTS, once seen as one of the safest stocks on the market, is searching for
a remedy for its ailing share price. Since January, its shares have been
among the weakest in the FTSE-100, underperforming the market by almost 25
per cent.
The cure may be elusive, as on the surface the patient seems as healthy,
under Sir James Blyth its chief executive since 1987, as ever. The chemists,
retailing and pharmaceuticals group is expected to report on Thursday a 14
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 359.5m to Pounds 410m in the
year to March. However, that may not be enough to dispel City nerves. 'It is
very much a battle between the actual numbers and market sentiment,' said Mr
John Richards, stores analyst at NatWest Securities.
The problem is that much of the profits rise will come from Boots The
Chemists, the best-performing division in the group and provider of almost
60 per cent of its operating profits. The City is worried that future profit
growth at BTC may be limited.
Boots' prices have come under fire recently. First, Superdrug, the discount
chain owned by Kingfisher, launched sharp discounts on fragrances, sun-care
products and condoms. Then last week, the Mergers and Monopolies Commission
was highly critical of Boots pricing on contact lens solutions. Unless Boots
can strike some counterblows in the public relations battle, sales and
margins could be under threat.
BTC is the UK's eighth-biggest retailer, with sales of Pounds 2.47bn last
year. Profits have increased almost threefold from Pounds 101m in 1988 to a
forecast Pounds 285m in the year to March. Much of the improvement has come
from a doubling of margins in the same period to almost 10 per cent. That
has been achieved thanks to increased sales of high-margin products such as
food and own-label goods; a weeding out of less profitable lines; and the
introduction of sophisticated technology.
But anecdotal evidence, supported by last week's MMC report on contact lens
solutions, also suggests Boots uses its buying power mercilessly to screw
rock-bottom prices out of its suppliers. Yet critics say its selling prices
are only competitive because its dominance enables it to set the levels in
an otherwise fragmented market, and that it does not pass its efficiency
savings on to the consumer.
Whatever the reality behind Superdrug's claims to be cheaper, its successful
public relations campaign has reinforced customers' impressions that BTC's
prices are too high - as Boots' own research has shown. Price cuts initiated
by Superdrug are often followed by the big superstore operators such as
Sainsbury and Tesco, which have started to compete with Boots on its
traditional home territory - over-the-counter medicines and personal care
products. Boots seems to have acknowledged the threat by agreeing to set up
small outlets within Sainsbury stores from this July on a trial basis.
Any pressure on BTC's profits could have serious implications, as the
performance of the rest of the group is less than inspiring - especially
those divisions acquired in the Pounds 900m takeover of Ward White in 1989.
The retail division is forecast to cut overall losses from Pounds 5.3m to
about Pounds 3.5m, but still contains two problem cases.
Do It All, the DIY joint venture formed in 1990 when Boot's Payless chain
merged with WH Smith's Do It All, is forecast to drop from a small profit
last year to a loss of Pounds 12m-Pounds 14m.
The venture has found it difficult to be number three in the market (after
B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare), saddled with some old stores in poor locations.
Moreover, it started up just as the housing market slumped, and a series of
price-cutting wars between DIY retailers saw margins collapse. Both Boots
and WH Smith say they are committed to turning Do It All around, by
developing its brand identity and offering better service and information to
customers. But some critics still say they would do better closing the
business.
Children's World, the edge-of-town childrenswear and toy chain, is expected
to cut losses from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 4m-Pounds 6m, but after five years
is not close to profit. 'One of the few ways Boots could redeem its
reputation is to get the axe out, and Children's World would be a prime
candidate,' suggested one analyst.
Other retailing businesses are not doing so badly. Halfords, its car parts
and bicycle retail chain, is expected to show its first full-year profit of
about Pounds 3m, from a Pounds 10.5m loss last year. It is reaping the
benefits from a shake-up of its accounting system and management, the
application of Boots retailing skills and systems, and a revamp of its car
service centres. Boots Opticians is another bright spot, with trading
profits likely to rise to Pounds 6.5m from Pounds 5.5m.
The outlook is similarly mixed for the other main weapon in Boots's armoury,
its pharmaceuticals division, which is expected to show a fall in trading
profits from Pounds 120.8m to Pounds 110m.
Boots is a minnow in the rapidly-consolidating drugs industry and there are
doubts whether the division is large enough to discover and then develop
innovative compounds on the global basis necessary to ensure a reasonable
return on R&amp;D investment.
High hopes were pinned on last year's launch of Manoplax, a treatment for
congestive heart failure, nicknamed Mananaplax by the City because of the
time it took to bring to market.
But a study released earlier this year suggested that at certain doses
patients suffered higher mortality rates than on placebo. This means that
even if Manoplax is tolerated at lower doses, the company will have big
difficulties convincing specialists of its utility. Lehman Brothers, the US
brokers, downgraded projected sales for 1995 from Dollars 100m (Pounds
64.9m) to Dollars 75m. They had previously expected sales to reach Dollars
250m towards the end of the decade. Some analysts speculate Manoplax could
be withdrawn.
'Fundamentally, Boots is still a strong business,' concluded one analyst
last week. 'The trouble is there's lots of meat for the bears to chew on.'
