BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group, yesterday said it was 'looking
at' the pharmaceutical division of Boots, the UK high-street chemist and
retailer, but refused to comment on reports that it had made a takeover
offer.
BASF is one of several companies that have discussed buying the Boots'
pharmaceuticals division. A management buy-out team has also shown interest.
Boots has one of its regular main board meetings later this week and the
future of the pharmaceuticals division is certain to be discussed.
Mr Jens-Uwe Bliesener, a corporate development executive at Knoll, BASF's
main healthcare subsidiary, said Boots was one of the top 50 companies
worldwide which had been examined in the group's well-publicised search for
potential partners.
He declined to say whether the UK business was still of interest or if talks
were under way. 'We have no official statement,' he said.
However, Mr Bliesener conceded that BASF was trying to fill gaps in its
market coverage, including the UK and France. Japan, where Knoll is
unrepresented, was also of interest.
Boots pharmaceutical sales are largely in the UK, the US and Commonwealth
countries. Its main products are Synthroid, a thyroid drug, and ibuprofen,
an anti-inflammatory and painkiller.
Knoll, with annual drugs and medication sales of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn)
compared with DM11bn at Hoechst, is considered too small to compete
efficiently with other research-based pharmaceutical companies.
Its research budget this year is expected to be about DM300m. It has no
obvious successor products to replace top-seller Isoptin, a heart treatment
on which the European patents expire in 1996.
Sales last year totalled more than DM500m.
Knoll's main advantage is that it has an immensely-rich parent group whose
chairman, Mr Jurgen Strube, refuses to contemplate withdrawal from the drugs
business.
Recent efforts to improve prospects include belated entry into the German
generics markets with a new company, BASF Generika.
