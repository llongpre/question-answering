FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Injection for pharmaceuticals - The effects
of recent FDA rulings

THE FDA'S new year gifts to the UK pharmaceutical industry give the three
companies concerned a flying start to the rest of the decade. The drugs
approved are already selling well in markets outside the US, but approval in
the world's biggest single market is central to their fortunes.
SmithKline Beecham's antidepressant Paxil could be the company's biggest
selling product by the end of the century, replacing the venerable Tagamet,
the ulcer treatment that lost out to Glazo's Zantac in the 1980s.
Paxil has only two significant competitors, Lilly's Prozac and Pfizer's
Zoloft, but is cheaper than either. The low price will appeal to
budget-conscious healthcare managers when it is launched in the next few
weeks.
Fisons and Boots are even more dependent on the success of their new
products. Approval for Tilade comes just nine months before the main patents
run out on Fisons' existing asthma treatment Intal, and the company has no
other significant products ready for submission to the FDA.
Approval is a watershed for Fisons. During most of the six years since the
drug's submission, the company's relations with the FDA have deteriorated.
FDA investigations led to licence suspensions on other products, and the
company had to made 91 amendments to the Tilade submission.
Fisons shares fell sharply last year, which also saw the departure of
several senior executives including Mr John Kerridge, the chairman and
driving force during the 1980s.
Even now, the company's troubles are not completely behind it. The terms of
the FDA approval mean that Tilade is unlikely to live up to the promise it
once had. Clinical trials show that Intal is better than Tilade in several
respects. Fisons has recognised that Tilade will not replace Intal in many
markets. Intal is used mostly by children and Fisons intends to market
Tilade primarily to adult asthma suffers, limiting its potential market.
For Boots, better known for its retail chain of pharmacies, Manoplax
promises a break into the pharmaceutical big time. Congestive heart failure
is estimated by the American Heart Association to affect as many as three
million people in the US with 400,000 new cases being reported every year,
says Boots.
Although analysts forecast sales of up to Dollars 250m (Pounds 165m) a year
eventually, this is largely a stab in the dark. Survey figures on whether
and how much Manoplax prolongs the lives of those who take it have yet to be
compiled. If they show that patients live longer, as well as having symptoms
relieved, the sales potential is far higher.
