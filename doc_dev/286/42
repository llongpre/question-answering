generics

Bristol-Myers Squibb, the second largest US pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday joined the drugs industry dash for corporate deal-making by buying
a 25 per cent stake in Azupharma, a German drugs manufacturer.
Azupharma specialises in the manufacture of generics, unbranded drugs that
have lost their patent protection. It is a subsidiary of German drugs
wholesaler Gehe which had sales in 1993 of DM10.2bn.
The value of the deal was not disclosed.
'This investment is an important strategic move in the European healthcare
environment,' said Mr Joachim von Roy, Bristol-Myers Squibb's European
president.
'It represents the beginning of an alliance between Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Gehe. We are now well-positioned to develop a strong generic presence across
Europe.'
The generics market in Europe is 'expected to grow substantially over the
next five years', said Bristol-Myers Squibb, as a result of changes in
healthcare spending and patent expiries on several big selling prescription
drugs.
The deal is Bristol-Myers Squibb's first stake in a European generics
producer. The two companies began a business relationship March when
Bristol-Myers Squibb licensed a generic version of its biggest selling drug,
heart treatment Capoten, to Azupharma for the German market.
The move reverses a recent trend for German companies to buy into US
generics manufacturers. In February, Bayer, the German chemicals group, paid
Dollars 310m for a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a
privately-owned generics company based in Florham Park, New Jersey.
That deal followed the Dollars 546m acquisition last November by German
chemicals giant Hoechst of a 51 per cent stake in Copley, a US generics and
over-the-counter drugs maker.
Acquiring generics companies serves two purposes for a drugs manufacturer:
it is an entry into a rapidly growing part of the healthcare sector and it
may help protect market share when patents expire.
Bristol-Myers Squibb is facing the expiry of patents on Capoten around the
world. The drug is an Ace-inhibitor, the newest type of heart drug which
faces strong competition from Merck, the biggest US drugs company, and the
UK's Zeneca, formerly part of ICI.
Capoten's global sales last year were worth Dollars 1.8bn, according to
stockbroker Lehman Brothers. This figure is likely to fall sharply after
patents expire in its biggest market, the US, next year.
