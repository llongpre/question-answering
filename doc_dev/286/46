FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Heartache for Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Boots' wheezing pharmaceuticals strategy has finally collapsed, the
company cannot avoid questions about the future of its drugs division. To
put it at its highest, there has only ever been a tenuous connection between
ethical pharmaceuticals research and retailing. Contract manufacturing and
over-the-counter drugs may have a role in sustaining Boots, but any serious
ambitions in new drug development seem to have expired along with Manoplax.
Whether Boots' management can now summon the will to make a graceful exit
is, however, another question. The board has a rigorous appraisal system for
businesses, yet that process has not so far persuaded it to dump Ward White
elephants such as Do It All. Even if it decides on a managed withdrawal, the
route is uncertain. Demerging ethical drugs would have the advantage of
putting its value in the hands of shareholders. There might, however, be
difficulty in deciding just which assets should go into the demerged
company. Selling the division to a larger drugs player would dilute earnings
and raise worries about how the management would spend the proceeds.
Shareholders have not yet forgotten how much value went west with the Ward
White bid.
Putting capital to work is a question for the group anyway, since the
company's drive for cash may leave it with net cash this year. Currently the
management's answer is expansion of Halfords, and growth in Boots the
Chemist. Yet in a tough market BTC's margins look vulnerable, nor has it yet
launched a market share initiative to rival the Marks and Spencers
'outstanding value' campaign. Halfords somehow looks an unlikely ground for
Boots to prove the critics wrong.
