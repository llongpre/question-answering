   Boots Co., London, said U.S. and British clinical trials of a new drug showed it was less successful than expected in treating congestive heart failure. 

   The British pharmaceuticals and retailing concern added that "the analysis of all the data isn't due to be completed for some weeks" and that no decision has been made on the drug's future. 

   In a brief statement, however, Boots said a full evaluation of the results, which were particularly disappointing in the U.S. trials, could lead Boots to "decide not to proceed with the Manoplax program in certain countries." 
It added, "Complete cancellation is also a possibility."
