FT  03 AUG 93 / An unhealthy outcome: German reforms have hit drug sales

Mr Horst Seehofer, Germany's health minister, should be content. The reforms
he launched in January to rein in spending on medicines have proved
successful.
The German drugs market, last year Europe's largest and growing at about 10
per cent a year, has been thrown into sharp reverse. Over the first five
months of this year sales have fallen by 11 per cent.
Mr Seehofer's counterpart at the economics ministry is, however, less likely
to be enthusiastic. According to Mr Hans Joachim Langmann, chairman of E
Merck, the family-owned German drugs group, 'the world is falling apart' for
drug manufacturers.
While the company may be overstating the case, two developments are likely:
first, research and development could be adversely affected, particularly
among small companies, many of which say they can no longer afford to
develop new products; second, the reforms may trigger a restructuring of the
sector.
The threat to the large groups' R&amp;D spending seems minimal. But many small
and medium-sized groups have not been able to absorb the fall in their sales
and maintain R&amp;D spending. The Bundes verband der Pharmazeutscher Industrie
(BPI), the industry association, says 41 per cent of the 126 companies it
surveyed in February planned to cut R&amp;D budgets.
The package introduced by Mr Seehofer included an across-the-board 5 per
cent price cut for prescription medicines followed by a price freeze for the
same categories until the end of 1994. Prescription charges have also been
raised, dampening demand.
But it has been Mr Seehofer's cuts in doctors' drugs budgets that have
really hit sales. He set their 1993 budget at DM24bn, the same level as in
1991 and DM3bn below last year's figure. If doctors exceed their budget, the
first DM280m excess will be borne by them personally.
Mr Walter Wenninger, managing director of the healthcare division of Bayer,
Germany's second-largest pharmaceuticals group after Hoechst, says: 'The
threat of financial penalties (has) led to a truly awful change in
prescribing habits, forcing doctors to cut both the number and value of
their prescriptions.'
The scale of the collapse in sales has been unprecedented. Dr Heinz Ried,
managing director of domestic operations at Boehringer-Ingelheim, the
pharmaceuticals group, says that, on present trends, Germany's drugs bill
this year could undershoot by as much as DM6bn, or 25 per cent.
For some companies the initial impact of the reforms has been severe. The
BPI survey of companies representing 64 per cent of the German market found
that more than half had seen falls in domestic turnover of 30-50 per cent in
February.
Small and medium-sized groups, which have little international exposure and
often sell traditional herbal-based medicines, have been hit hard. Madaus,
for example, a small family-owned group in Cologne, has seen domestic sales
fall by 20 per cent in the six months to June.
The downturn has also hit the giants of the German industry. Bayer has seen
its sales fall by 10 per cent so far this year after an increase of 9 per
cent for the whole of last year. Boehringer-Ingelheim expects its domestic
sales to drop this year by between 10 per cent and 12 per cent, leading to a
reduction in turnover of up to DM100m.
The German subsidiaries of foreign groups are suffering too. Astra, the
fast-growing Swedish group and seventh-largest drugs company in Germany,
posted first-quarter sales down by 16 per cent in what is its largest single
market. Ciba, the Swiss group and fourth-largest pharmaceuticals company in
Germany, reported a 17 per cent fall in German turnover during the first six
months of this year, compared with an increase of 9 per cent in the whole of
1992.
The only groups to have benefited from the reforms are companies selling
cheaper generic products, the patents of which have expired. Doctors are
turning to cheaper medicines to keep within their budgets. Dr Michael
Steiner, vice-president of The Boston Consulting Group, management advisers,
says generics groups, which include the German groups Ratiopharm and Hexal,
have doubled their market share to about 20 per cent so far this year.
While the generics companies have welcomed the reforms, the reaction of the
drugs groups was initial incredulity. 'For the first three months the
pharmaceuticals groups couldn't believe it,' says Dr Steiner. 'They had
invested millions of D-Marks to explain the merits of their drugs. But all
that mattered for doctors was price. It was then they realised the impact of
the reforms would be lasting.'
The fall in sales has forced most groups to introduce short-term working and
cut jobs. BASF Pharma, BASF's drugs division formerly known as Knoll, will
cut its 3,785-strong German labour force by up to 15 per cent this year,
while Boehringer-Ingelheim is making up to 500 of its 2,500 workers in
Germany redundant. Madaus, the small German group, has cut its domestic
workforce by a third, from 1,200 to 800.
The overriding concern for drugs companies is that Mr Seehofer could
introduce further cuts in doctors' budgets next year. 'Nothing is more
encouraging than success. The government has seen that it costs nothing
politically to push these measures through. We expect to be squeezed more,'
says Mr Martin Vischer, head of Ciba's pharmaceuticals division. Mr Seehofer
has been able to head off doctors' protests by promising not to examine the
issue of their fees.
In any event, the structure of the pharmaceuticals industry will never be
the same. 'Cost-cutting can only go so far,' says Dr Ried at
Boehringer-Ingelheim. 'The small and medium-sized companies with little
business outside Germany will disappear or merge. They just won't have the
means to develop new medicines.'
Consolidation has yet to take place because pharmaceuticals companies have
traditionally been expensive and their prices will need to fall before big
groups become interested in buying.
Nevertheless, Mr Vischer at Ciba believes consolidation is inevitable:
'Within two years, the landscape will be unrecognisable. The smaller
companies will have gone. The generic manufacturers will still be winning
market share and the research-based companies will be trying to adapt. And
that will be painful.'
The aim of reform was to force the pharmaceuticals groups to cut costs and
deliver better value for money. Only those which manage to combine these
twin imperatives will survive. The one unexpected outcome of reform has been
the severity of its impact on small and medium companies, some of which are
now in danger of being squeezed out.
