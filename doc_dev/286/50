President Bush, approaches 100 percent although the disease can be fatal if

<TEXT>     In healthy people, an elaborate system of chemical checks and balances
makes certain the body gets only as much thyroid hormones as needed.;    Dr.
Kenneth Burman, an Army colonel and thyroid expert at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, said it was very unusual for a husband and wife -- Barbara Bush is
also afflicted -- to get the illness. As far as is known, Graves' disease is
not contagious, but seems triggered when the thyroid over-produces antibodies
from the body's immune system. The cause is unknown.;    The treatment the
president is receiving has a long history of success. The patient drinks
radioactive iodine, which turns an overactive thyroid gland into an
underactive one. If the thyroid output dips too low, doctors prescribe a
supplement.;    A natural treatment can reduce thyroid output, although it
wouldn't be powerful enough to cure the president's disease.;    It probably
wouldn't be his drug of choice, anyway: It's broccoli.;  The President's
thyroid problem;    President Bush's overactive thyroid, blamed for the atrial
fibrillation of his heart, has been treated with radioactive iodine. His
physicians expect to be able to control the condition, called Graves'
disease.; What the thyroid does;    The thyroid secretes hormones that control
the body's metabolism, including functions of the heart, liver, brain and
muscle tissue.; Hyperthyroidism; (Graves' disease);    (check) Excessive
production of thyroid hormones.; (check) Cause unknown.; (check) Can cause
increased or irregular heart rate, fast breathing, weight loss despite
appetite increase, increased sweating, heat intolerance, fatigue and muscle
weakness.; Bush's treatment; "Radioactive cocktail";    (check) Bush was given
drink of radioactive iodine solution.; (check) The iodine passed into his
bloodstream and concentrated in the thyroid.; (check) In coming months,
radioactivity will destroy some of the thyroid gland's cells, reducing its
activity.; (check) Doctors can fine-tune Bush's thyroid activity with thyroid
hormone pills; President's medication;    Bush's heart condition is being
treated with these drugs:;    (check) Digoxin- Calms the activity of the
entire heart.;    (check) Procainamide: Blocks the errant electrical signals
producing irregular heartbeats.;    (check) Warfarin: Thins the blood to
prevent a stroke if a blood clot forms.;    (check) Aspirin: Another
blood-thinning drug.;    Source: Chicago Tribune, Encyclopedia of Science and
