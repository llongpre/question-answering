   A David and Goliath battle is shaping up in the prescription-drug business, with the U.S. contraceptive-pill market the battleground. 

   David is Lexis Pharmaceuticals Inc., a privately held, generic drug company in Austin, Texas. 
And Goliath is Johnson &amp; Johnson Co., the big drug company based in New Brunswick, N.J. 

   Lexis will begin the fight within a few weeks by selling a generic version of Johnson &amp; Johnson's big-selling Ortho-Novum 1/35. 
Moreover, Lexis plans to go directly to pill users, offering them rebates of $10 or more and an additional discount off the brand price. 
The company intends to advertise the offer in consumer magazines and on television. 

   The scheme is the latest, and most blatant, effort by a pharmaceutical company to bypass doctors and pitch a prescription product directly to consumers. 
The approach will likely upset doctors who don't think patients should make decisions about prescription medicines. 
But it may be the best route for a small company seeking to crack the prescription-drug market. 

   "Probably the only way to sell a generic version of the pill is to give women a reason to ask their doctors for it," says the head of an independent drug sales force. 
"The doctors won't do it themselves." 

   Some pharmacists who recently received details of the promotion also voice support for the idea. 
Many of them make little money from Johnson &amp; Johnson's product -- thanks to recent price increases and stiff competition among retailers. 
"I think (Lexis's brand) will put some welcome price pressure on (Johnson &amp; Johnson)," says Samuel Kaplan, director of pharmacy for Thayer Pharmacies, a privately owned, 30-store chain based in Stoughton, Mass. 

   Mr. Kaplan says he expects to sell the Lexis contraceptive version for about 35% less than Ortho-Novum and that his profit margin will still be bigger. 

   Indeed, the Lexis strategy is based on surveys it recently conducted showing that while doctors believe their patients aren't interested in the cost of the pill, pill users themselves often shop among drugstores. 

   Ortho-Novum 1/35 has annual sales in the U.S. of about $160 million and is among the most prescribed contraceptive pills. 
In all, Johnson &amp; Johnson has about 42% of all new prescriptions in a market that generates about $800-million-a-year in sales. 

   Patent protection on the ingredients in Ortho-Novum 1/35 lapsed several years ago, but previous efforts by several companies to sell less expensive generic brands have flopped. 
That's partly because doctors are worried about side effects from the pills and are comfortable with Johnson &amp; Johnson's long track record. 

   Lexis's attack, even if it fails to win sizable market share, is certain to be watched closely in the drug industry -- if only because it's the brainchild of John Bryer, who pioneered consumer drug advertising in 1983, when he ran the U.S. unit of Boots Co. of Great Britain. 
Then, Mr. Bryer marketed a product that captured sales from an Upjohn Co. arthritis drug by offering patients rebates and advertising the offer on television. 
Boots's run at Upjohn was short-lived, though, because the drug's main ingredient became available over the counter without a prescription. 

   Hired earlier this year as president of Lexis, Mr. Bryer quickly decided to push the contraceptive pill's relatively low price. 
The Lexis version of the pill, called NEE 1/35, is chemically identical to Ortho-Novum 1/35, but a month's supply will be sold to pharmacies for about $8, a bit more than half the price of Johnson &amp; Johnson's product. 

   Moreover, women who buy a six month's supply of the Lexis product will be eligible for a $10 rebate check. 
Twelve months of purchases will be rewarded with $20. 
The offer will be promoted later in the fall in TV ads and in women's magazines. 
Mr. Bryer says he may also place an ad in a men's sports magazine because "if men knew the cost, they might be more inclined to help share it." 

   Johnson &amp; Johnson couldn't comment on the plan since its officials were unaware of it. 
But the company is expected to fight off Lexis by aggressively promoting a newer pill product, Ortho-Novum 7/7/7, which has patent protection.
