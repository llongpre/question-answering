The BOOTS Company has announced that Terry Richardson, managing director of
international and marketing of Boots Pharmaceuticals, is to take early
retirement. Richardson, 57, was appointed a member of the group board in
1983; he is not being replaced.
Boots Pharmaceuticals has been troubled by the withdrawal in July of
Manoplax, its treatment for congestive heart failure; this led to a Pounds
35m charge and left a large hole in the division's drug portfolio.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, has said the group was conducting a
fundamental reappraisal of its pharmaceuticals business and no options had
been ruled out. The drugs division has been widely seen as too small to be
viable.
Boots Pharmaceuticals had a turnover last year of Pounds 762m and generated
operating profits of Pounds 108m. Non-UK turnover was Pounds 425m, with
operating profits of Pounds 85m.
