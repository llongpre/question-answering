FT  05 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 5 per cent drop in the Boots share price in response to a 9 per
cent rise in full year earnings seems a little perverse. Gruesome though it
is to see the non-chemist retail business lose Pounds 5m on Pounds 625m of
turnover, it is scarcely unexpected. It may also be disconcerting to hear
that spending on the heart drug Manoplax - Mananaplax as market wags call it
 -will rise this year from Pounds 18m to nearer Pounds 50m. But such
expenditure was always inevitable as the drug neared approval.
Granted, the figures recall a fundamental question: what on earth a hugely
successful chemist and druggist is doing losing money in DIY, toys and car
maintenance. The basic premise - that Boots' traditional retailing skills
could be applied outside its traditional markets - is plainly open to
question. The losses at Halfords, for instance, are due not only to the
recession but to basic flaws belatedly addressed. But if the non-chemist
retail brands prove intractable, they could doubtless be sold off when
retail spending eventually revives. In the meantime, it plainly helps that
they generated net cash last year despite their losses.
More generally, it is perhaps time to let the Ward White acquisition slip
into history. In the three years since the bid was launched, Boots' shares
have outperformed the market by 50 per cent and the stores sector by a
third. That same performance may make it hard to see the shares as cheap.
But plainly, the company has proved robust enough to survive its mistakes.
