FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Cost-cutting lifts BP - The week
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY: British Petroleum is expected to announce net profits of about
Pounds 360m when it publishes third-quarter results. Cost-cutting in recent
years is likely to leave it with a stronger improvement than has been
achieved by its peers. The chemicals division could bring pleasant
surprises, with a solid performance in the US. TUESDAY: Interim results from
Thames Water open the water companies' reporting season. The interims are
expected to show an 8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, before exceptionals,
to Pounds 148m.
Investors will be watching two issues very closely in the first results
after the summer's price review: first, the dividend, forecast to show an 8
per cent increase to 8p; and, second, the performance of the non-core
businesses. A dose of further bad news on the non-core operation would not
be welcomed.
TUESDAY: Powerscreen International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer
of screening and stone-crushing equipment, is expected to report interim
pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m-Pounds 14m, against Pounds 12.6m last year.
Analysts will be examining the performance of Simplicity Engineering and
Ludlow-Saylor, two US businesses acquired in February.
WEDNESDAY: BET, the business services group, is expected to report pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 54m for the six months to September, compared with
Pounds 47m, but the picture is clouded by uncertainty over the scale of
further rationalisation costs. The group, which over-expanded through
acquisition in the 1980s, has recently seen a couple of high-level
departures and analysts will want reassurance that its recent recovery
remains on course.
Specifically, there has been little sign so far of the 'bolt-on'
acquisitions which John Clark, the chief executive, mooted in May.
WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY: Interims from J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest food
retailer (Wednesday) and final results from Kwik Save, the biggest discount
chain (Thursday), should provide an insight into the state of the grocery
market.
Pre-tax profit forecasts for Sainsbury range from Pounds 430m to about
Pounds 460m, with the consensus at around Pounds 445m - a 7 per cent
increase from a re-stated Pounds 417m last year. Sales in the supermarket
chain are expected to be up by about 7.5 per cent, with little price
inflation.
Forecasts for Kwik Save are concentrated around Pounds 130m, an increase of
only 3 per cent from last year's Pounds 126.1m. The group has been affected
by the increased competition in the market, which is eroding its price
advantage over the superstores. Analysts are looking for an increased
interim dividend of about 5.5p, against 4.9p last time.
WEDNESDAY: BAT Industries is expected to report an increase of about 10 per
cent in third-quarter pre-tax profits from last year's Pounds 455m. The main
growth will come from US tobacco where BAT, along with other producers, has
enjoyed a recovery from last year's pricing traumas brought on by 'Marlboro
Friday'.
THURSDAY: Speculation over the future of Boots' pharmaceuticals division is
expected to overshadow sharply improved interim figures from the retailing
and drugs group.
Although it is expected to highlight an increase of about 33 per cent in
first-half profits, analysts are likely to focus on the outcome of the
company's year-long review of the drugs business.
This was prompted by last year's withdrawal of the heart drug Manoplax,
which left a gap in products under development.
Boots' officials insist they are under no pressure to sell the business,
which remains both profitable and cash-generative. But rumours that disposal
was the favoured choice were heightened earlier this year when the company
issued a confidential sales memorandum for potential bidders.
While confirming that it is in discussions with a number of companies, the
group remains coy about its intentions - partly to avoid rousing fears of a
possible withdrawal from Nottingham, where the pharmaceuticals division is
based.
Meanwhile, interim pre-tax profits are forecast to have risen from Pounds
174.6m to about Pounds 233m, although last year's figures were depressed by
Pounds 35m of charges. The chemists' chain, however, is expected to remain
the most profitable division.
