A warning over the risks of the heart drug Manoplax pushed down the shares
of its maker, Boots. The price of the retail and drugs company fell 5 to
435p in a volume of 2.5m after the Washington-based pharmaceuticals
newsletter the Pink Sheet highlighted problems with the drug.
Its 100ml dosage must now carry a warning after trial data found that
patients taking high dosages were more likely to die than those not taking
the drug. One analyst said the revelations added to a question mark over the
credibility of Boots and that there must be a long-term doubt over the
long-term risk.
