BASF, the German chemicals group, is to cut up to 15 per cent of the
workforce employed in its German pharmaceuticals divisions.
Claiming that the domestic drugs companies had fallen deeply into the red in
the first half, Mr Hans-Uwe Schenck, chairman of the group's Knoll division,
said all cost-cutting possibilities were being examined in collaboration
with workers' representatives.
He calculated up to 600 of the 4,000 German workforce would have to go.
Other BASF officials complained recently that government health service
reforms had led to drugs turnover falling by as much as 18 per cent. Mr Ingo
Paetzke, a group director, forecast a decline in domestic sales for the full
year and even heavier falls in profits.
The group recently announced plans to restructure its pharmaceuticals
business, partly in response to rumours that it planned to dispose of it,
and partly to equip the business better for international competition.
Provided the board approves, all activities will be focused in a new
division, BASF-Pharma, from the start of next year. The main components of
the new division will be Knoll, Nordmark and Minden Pharma.
BASF employs 7,800 worldwide in pharmaceuticals. More than a quarter of its
DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn) turnover last year came from the German market, with
a further 30 per cent each from North America and elsewhere in Europe.
A management consultants' study on which the project is based recommended
that BASF reduce the number of research projects under way, and focus on the
most promising products, especially those with international marketing
prospects.
