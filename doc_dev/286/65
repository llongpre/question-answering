FT  24 NOV 93 / Cuts in drugs bills 'ineffective': Merck executive warns on
healthcare spending controls

European governments' efforts to cut drugs bills are ineffective and
counter-productive, according to Merck &amp; Co, the world's largest
pharmaceuticals group.
Mr David Anstice, Merck's senior vice-president for European human health,
warned at a conference in Brussels yesterday that drugs spending cuts would
not have a meaningful impact on overall expenditure because medicines
represented such a small part of healthcare spending.
Most European countries could control health spending more effectively
through other means, he argued. Many were paying large amounts for the wrong
sorts of medicines.
Doctors should alter prescribing habits to provide better value for money
for patients. This meant prescribing more innovative medicines, fewer
traditional treatments of dubious efficacy and more off-patent generic
drugs.
Only a quarter of government spending on medicines was on patented drugs.
Half, on average, was spent on over the counter non-prescription medicines -
which could be paid for by the patient - or generic pharmaceuticals from one
source. The latter tended to be traditional remedies restricted to a single
country and lacking any efficacy, Mr Anstice said.
As for patented medicines, doctors probably prescribed too many acute
therapies such as antibiotics, analgesics, and tranquillisers. On the other
hand, some illnesses such as arteriosclerosis were under-treated.
Savings could be made in distribution and dispensing for which European
governments were paying too much. Distribution and dispensing cost more than
50 per cent of the price of prescription pharmaceuticals, compared with 20
to 25 per cent in the US.
The European wholesaling industry might need to rationalise, cutting costs
and becoming more competitive. This would allow it to pass on lower costs to
government purchasers, Mr Anstice said.
Structural changes were required in healthcare delivery, he said.
Governments needed to measure the performance of healthcare delivery not
only through costs, but also outcome of treatment.
Pharmaceuticals companies which failed to keep high standards in medical
marketing should face stiff sanctions.
