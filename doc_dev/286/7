FT  04 NOV 94 / Boots warns of Christmas challenge

Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 66 per
cent increase in first-half profits following buoyant demand for branded
drugs and a Pounds 47.8m gain on the sale of Farleys baby foods.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 174.6m to Pounds 289.7m in the six months
to September 30, although last year's figures were distorted by a Pounds 35m
write off on Manoplax, the group's failed heart drug.
Underlying profits rose 20.4 per cent to Pounds 241.8m as the group enjoyed
increased sales of Synthroid, its thyroid deficiency treatment.
Shares in the company, however, fell 10p to 519p after it warned that US
demand for the drug was likely to fall in the second half, while adding that
UK consumer confidence remained fragile. 'Consumers are still being
cautious, and seeking value. Christmas is going to be a tough challenge for
most retailers,' said Sir James Blyth, chief executive.
Sluggish sales at DIY subsidiaries Do It All, the joint venture with WH
Smith, and AG Stanley contributed to a modest 2.8 per cent increase in
turnover from Pounds 1.99bn to Pounds 2.04bn.
Losses by these businesses undermined strong growth at Boots The Chemist,
the group's largest division, where profits increase 9 per cent to Pounds
144.6m on sales ahead 5.1 per cent at Pounds 1.37bn.
Sir James predicted the loss-making divisions would be profitable by the end
of the decade, but the group's caution persuaded analysts to downgrade
full-year profit forecasts by Pounds 10m to Pounds 545m. They were also
unsettled by uncertainty over the future of the pharmaceutical division,
which contributed sharply increased profits of Pounds 49.8m.
Although the company said its review of the division - prompted by the
withdrawal of Manoplax last year - was closer to a solution, it refused to
confirm expectations of an outright sale. Among the options for the
division, which employs 5,800, are joint ventures and restructuring. If
Boots sold the business, Sir James said it 'would examine ways of giving
cash back to the shareholders'.
The interim dividend was increased from 4.9p to 5.35p. Earnings per share
grew from 11.5p to 20.2p, while underlying earnings rose 16.4 per cent from
13.4p to 15.6p.
