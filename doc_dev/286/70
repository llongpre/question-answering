FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: A troublesome brew in Germany's
chemical industry - Recession, state intervention, a rising D-Mark and
competition are responsible

The chemicals industry is dismayed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision that
the rump of its east German counterpart will be a core element in the
region's recovery programme. On the Treuhand privatisation agency's plan to
spend another DM1bn this year on restructuring in the east, Mr Wolfgang
Hilger, Hoechst chairman, (left) asks if the government is not filling a
bottomless bucket.
ONE of the more predictable features of recession is that it eventually goes
away. But there are few consolations to the other spectres stalking
Germany's chemicals industry.
Some are familiar. High labour and environmental costs have haunted
manufacturers for years. Now, with government intervention, the rise of the
D-Mark and the rapid increase in competition from low-cost manufacturers in
Asia and elsewhere, labour and environmental costs are disturbing German
management's sleep more than they used to.
The effects of medical service reforms, imposed from January by Mr Horst
Seehofer, the new health minister, have had a dramatic immediate effect on
the pharmaceuticals trade.
This was underlined this week when BASF followed its announcement of a 41
per cent profits slump last year with news that short-time working was to be
introduced at its Knoll drugs subsidiary.
BASF said sales of some prescription drugs fell by 40 per cent in the first
two months of Mr Seehofer's reforms.
Apart from prescription limits and higher charges for patients, the industry
is having to cope with stringent price controls and cuts.
Drugs, traditionally the non-cyclical buffer cushioning German chemical
company profits, now seem drained of their power to protect.
According to Mr Jochen Huckmann, a spokesman for the pharmaceuticals
industry in the state of Hesse, the net effect of Mr Seehofer's economy
package will be a reduction in earnings of between 20 and 30 per cent.
He estimates that local manufacturers, which account for almost 20 per cent
of all German drugs output, suffered an average 24 per cent fall in sales
during January.
Meanwhile, at the bulk chemicals end of the production scale, the area most
sensitive to cyclical swings, the industry has been dismayed by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's decision that the rump of east German industry is to be
retained as a core element in the region's recovery programme.
Remarking on the Treuhand privatisation agency's plan to spend another DM1bn
this year on restructuring, Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of Hoechst,
questioned mildly if there were markets enough to absorb the east's output.
He asked, more sharply, if investments on this scale were sensible and if
the government was not committing itself to filling a bottomless bucket.
The answers appear clear enough. But, in the absence of discernible signs of
new industrial growth in the former DDR, the government is not going to
change its mind.
Meanwhile, although Bonn may ease some of its more rigorous strictures on
the health service, Mr Seehofer's intervention and trends in international
markets indicate that margins and profits will continue to be squeezed.
How successfully the German industry picks its way across this dramatically
altered landscape remains to be seen. The direction it has taken has been
clear for some time, but the pace has been slow and hesitant.
Although average profits fell by 25 per cent in 1990 and 20 per cent in
1991, it was not until last year, when earnings fell 30 per cent, that there
was serious reduction in the numbers of people employed. More than 20,000
jobs are expected to go this year - following a mere 8,000 job cuts in 1992.
Structural adjustment has also been sluggish and not always successful.
Among Germany's big three, BASF is most dependent on mainstream chemicals.
Accordingly, it has suffered most.
Ironically, most of BASF's difficulties stem from its 'non-chemical'
activities, which include heavy lossmakers such as magnetic tapes.
These businesses, which together account for some 48 per cent of sales, are
estimated to contribute just 2 per cent of profits. But change is coming -
through a DM4.6bn investment in a pipeline network, which will bring in
Russian gas and oil, plus a stable flow of profits. Energy interests already
account for around 25 per cent of group earnings.
Meanwhile, the company is trying to escape Germany's high-cost trap by
placing chemicals investment abroad.
A new steam cracker opens in Antwerp later this year, for example, and 60
per cent of the group's European spending outside the home market this year
will go to the Belgian site. In another more recent structural move, it
swapped its acrylics business for ICI's polypropylene interests.
Both strategies are driven by BASF's conviction that building up critical
mass and a cost-competitive edge in core sectors will help it resist the
capacity cuts widely believed necessary in the European chemicals industry.
It hopes this will enable it to emerge from the anticipated bloodletting in
the European chemicals sector relatively unscathed.
The recent decision by Hoechst to merge its PVC activities with Wacker
Chemie, accompanied by reorganisation at Celanese, was aimed at the same
end.
Bayer sits on its laurels as the first of Germany's big three to bite
decisively into its costs. Until now, it has been a distinct favourite among
investors, who are content with the estimated 75 per cent contribution to
profits from its drugs and information technology businesses. But last
week's 16 per cent fall in annual profits to DM2.7bn showed not even the one
of the big streamlined chemicals companies can escape the grip of world
recession.
