FT  25 MAR 94 / People: Sir Michael Angus to chair Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread and president of the CBI, is to
take over as chairman of retailing and pharmaceuticals group Boots from
July, in what analysts see as a highly significant appointment. There was
speculation yesterday that he was being appointed to take some tough
decisions at Boots - especially regarding the future of its pharmaceuticals
business.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive since 1987 and architect of the acquisition
of Ward White and reorganisation of Boots group into separate business
units, is being given the additional, and new, role, of deputy chairman. The
announcement prompted speculation that he is being groomed eventually to
succeed Sir Michael (right) as chairman.
Sir Michael, 63, is appointed a non-executive director with immediate effect
and will replace present chairman Sir Christopher Benson after the annual
meeting on July 24. Sir Christopher, chairman of Sun Alliance and Costain as
well as The Housing Corporation and The Funding Agency for Schools, has been
chairman since 1990 but has taken a low profile during the past year. He was
criticised for his handling of the group's annual meeting last year, which
was disrupted by animal rights protesters.
The more pugnacious Sir Michael, described by a former colleague as a
'tough, blunt businessman', spent much of his career with Unilever, after
service with the RAF and a degree at Bristol University.
After a spell as chairman and chief executive of Unilever US, during which
he restructured the US business, he was group chairman from 1986 to 1992. He
was credited with waking up a sleepy company, shedding some businesses and
refocusing the group on its core activities.
He has performed a similar task at Whitbread since 1992. He has also served
as CBI president since 1992, forming an effective partnership with
director-general Howard Davies.
In addition to his capacity for taking tough decisions, Sir Michael's
political influence and international experience are seen as assets to
Boots, particularly as it seeks to expand its over-the-counter drugs
business, Boots Healthcare International, overseas.
'The appointment of Sir Michael is quite a coup for us,' admits Boots. 'He
is highly-regarded and wields considerable influence.'
