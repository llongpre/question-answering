BASF, the German chemicals manufacturer, and Ivax, the Florida drugs maker,
have signed a letter of intent to set up a joint venture to sell generic
drugs in Europe. If the deal goes ahead, BASF would take a minority stake in
Ivax.
This would be BASF's first step into the rapidly growing generics market. It
follows acquisitions over the past year in the sector by its two arch rivals
in German chemicals, Bayer and Hoechst. BASF would take part in the venture
through Knoll, its pharmaceuticals subsidiary, which has the rights to 80
generic products. Ivax would contribute a 150-product portfolio at its UK
subsidiary, Norton Healthcare, which had sales last year of Dollars 144m.
