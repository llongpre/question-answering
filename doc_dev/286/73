Pounds 94m

Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is selling its Farleys baby
food group and its adult nutrition business to HJ Heinz, the US grocery
products group, for Pounds 94m.
The sale includes Pounds 20.7m of net assets, and brands such as Farleys
baby milk and rusks, Timers baby cereals, and the slimming products Complan,
Casilan and Crunch 'n' Slim.
Farleys sales totalled Pounds 53.3m in the year ended March 1993 - about one
third of the total sales of its parent division Boots Healthcare
International - with 70 per cent of those in the UK.
Other important markets are the Republic of Ireland, Pakistan, New Zealand
and east Asia.
Boots said that Farleys, which it acquired in 1986, was a strong business
but did not fit in with its strategy of developing the core over-the-counter
drugs business of Boots Healthcare International, by concentrating on the
four OTC categories of cough and cold remedies, pain relief, eye care, and
skin care.
The proceeds would be used to expand BHI, which was planning more
acquisitions. It purchased two French and Italian healthcare companies, La
Societe Francaise du Triclocarban, and Marco Viti, for Pounds 14.5m last
year.
'We are being fairly aggressive in terms of developing BHI into a
fully-fledged pan-European business', Boots said.
For Heinz, the purchase is expected to increase its worldwide baby food
sales by 15 per cent to about Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m) and make it the
UK's biggest supplier of baby food.
It said Farleys' range, comprising mainly 'dry' foods such as rusks and
cereals, would complement its own range of mainly 'wet' foods in jars and
tins. Heinz is taking on all 450 staff at Farleys, which has factories in
Kendal, Cumbria, and in Karachi, Pakistan.
Mr Andrew Barrett, managing director of HJ Heinz UK, said the acquisition
represented a 'significant opportunity to develop further our overseas
business and, specifically, to build towards our goal - to be a leading
player in baby feeding in Europe.'
Analysts welcomed the deal, saying the price of Pounds 94m was a fair one,
but Boots shares closed down 15p at 509p in a weak market.
