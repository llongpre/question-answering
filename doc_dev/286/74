<HEAD>Women, Whites at Greater Risk of Thyroid Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women and whites are at greater risk of
thyroid disease than other groups, according to a study that found
nearly 9 percent of people over 55 suffer from some thyroid gland
dysfunction.
   In the Wayne State University study of 488 whites and 480
blacks, 8.9 percent suffered some thyroid dysfunction, said Dr.
Nanda Bagchi, a professor of medicine at the school. Two percent of
the total suffered hyperthoidism, or excessive thyroid function,
and 6.9 percent had hypothyroidism, too little.
   The thyroid, located in front and to each side of the trachea,
secretes thyroxine to regulate growth and metabolism.
Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, nervousness, rapid pulse and
muscle weakness. Hypothyroidism can cause sluggishness, puffiness,
constipation, depression, weight gain and hair loss.
   About half the cases of hypothyroidism were caused by underlying
autoimmune thyroid disease, a condition that causes the body to
react to the thyroid and diminishes its function, Bagchi said.
Two-thirds of the hyperthyroidism cases were attributable to too
much thyroid hormone prescribed by doctors, he said.
   Treatment of hyperthyroidism is particularly important among
older people because it can aggravate heart disease, he said.
Thyroid disease strikeds about 15 percent of people aged 75 and
over, about twice as often as those 55-64.
   The study, reported last month at a meeting of the American
Thyroid Association, also found that 12.7 percent of whites had
dysfunction, compared with 6.9 percent of blacks; and 11.2 percent
of women vs. 6.2 percent of men.

<HEAD>Study Finds Drug-Exposed Children Face Learning Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Toddlers exposed to cocaine in the womb are
shorter, have smaller heads and are more likely to have learning
handicaps than children who have not been exposed, according to a
study on drugs and pregancy.
   ``We foresee that many of these children will end up in special
education, or classes for the learning disabled,'' said Dr. Ira
Chasnoff, the director of the Chicago-based study of 277 children,
including 228 exposed to drugs. Two-thirds of the mothers used
other drugs in addition to cocaine, he said.
   The problems include a lack of concentration and inability to
accomplish tasks easily performed by other children, concluded the
study released to the National Association for Perinatal Addiction
Research and Education.
   The association estimates that 375,000 babies are born each year
in the United States to mothers who used drugs during their
pregnancy.
   A Boston University study earlier this year found similar
results on stature and head size. Chasnoff said, `This has a lot of
implications for long-term development'' since head circumference
is an indication of brain growth.
   ``These children, on the whole, are not mentally retarded.
Overall, these babies cognitively and functioning normally,'' he
said. The tendency to become distracted and troubled by
unstructured tasks holds back the exposed children.
   On tests calling for blocks to be put in appropriate-shaped
holes, drug-exposed children were more likely to become confused
and overwhelmed.
   ``What I hear teachers telling me are the same things I'm
telling you right here,'' Chasnoff said at an association
conference last month. ``The teachers are calling this to the
attention of the school systems, but the school systems are not
ready to deal with it.''
