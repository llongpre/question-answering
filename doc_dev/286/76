RETAIL and drugs group Boots is believed to be considering savage cuts to
its loss-making Do It All home improvement business and also entertaining
offers for its pharmaceutical research division, according to analysts who
attended a meeting with management on Monday night.
The possibility that such moves could bring a special one-off dividend
payment to shareholders was also raised at the meeting, although a company
spokesman yesterday denied that it was under active consideration.
Analysts expressed relief that tough action appeared to be under way at Do
It All, which Boots runs in a joint venture with WH Smith. Boots indicated
that it was considering closing around half of its 200 DIY stores, and
implementing a substantial refurbishment programme in the remaining units to
bolster its faltering market share. Even so, some stores sector specialists
in the City believe Boots may yet reconsider its position in the DIY market
if the necessary improvements are not forthcoming in six months' time.
While the company said it remained committed to its drugs division, analysts
said that privately the company was resigned to withdrawing from this area
of business. Speculation that the company would make a disposal has grown
following its withdrawal last week of Manoplax, its top-selling heart drug.
Boots added 5 at 447p in another day's hefty turnover of 6.8m. WH Smith 'A'
gained 2 at 446p.
