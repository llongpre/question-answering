WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals company involved in the world's largest
non-privatisation secondary share issue, has received permission from the
German regulatory authorities to sell Zovirax, its best-selling anti-viral
drug, without a prescription in chemists.
Germany is the largest pharmaceuticals market in Europe and the third
largest after the US and Japan. About 30 per cent of pharmaceuticals sales
there are without prescriptions. Zovirax's German patents run out next year,
allowing generic manufacturers to launch their own versions.
Wellcome already sells Zovirax, which is mostly used to treat herpes, over
the counter in New Zealand and has applications to do so in most other
European countries.
'We are delighted that Germany has been the first country in Europe to
license the product OTC,' said Mr Doug Clark, product manager in consumer
healthcare.
'The German authorities are stringent but appear to have passed the drug at
first reading. This augurs well for other markets.'
SG Warburg, the company's brokers, said in a recent research note on the
group that if 20 per cent of herpes sufferers in Australasia and Europe used
the drug once a year it would add Pounds 50m to Wellcome's annual sales.
This estimate was based on a price of about Pounds 4.37 for each 2g tube.
Wellcome plans to sell the product in Germany for about Pounds 10 a tube.
The company has a co-marketing agreement in Germany with Hoechst for Zovirax
prescription sales, but Mr Clark said he did not know whether that would be
extended to OTC.
Wellcome has no OTC presence in Germany at present. Mr John Robb, chief
executive, has said the group is in the final stages of negotiations with
two or three European groups to exploit OTC products more effectively.
