   Boots Co., the British drug maker and retailer, said a
committee that reports to the Food and Drug Administration
voted to recommend its heart treatment Manoplax for U.S.
distribution.
   The Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee, meeting in Washington
last week, recommended that the FDA allow U.S. sales of the
drug, meant for treating congestive heart failure in patients
who cannot take other treatments, Boots said. The company
said it would move quickly to fulfill remaining requirements
to gain U.S. marketing approval.
