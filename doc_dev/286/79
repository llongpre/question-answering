FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Campaigners put the boot in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANIMAL rights campaigners caused uproar at Boots' annual general meeting in
London yesterday.
They were complaining about the use of animals in testing the Manoplax heart
drug - withdrawn from circulation on Monday - and other products.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, struggled to control the meeting as
several shareholders who were animal rights supporters demanded to know how
much the company had spent on testing Manoplax on animals, and how many had
been involved.
One protester demanded that Boots withdraw from the pharmaceuticals business
in view of the suffering it caused to animals. Another demanded an apology
to the families of patients who had died prematurely as a result of taking
Manoplax.
Security guards had to be summoned at one point to keep order.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said that about 90 per cent of the Pounds
100m development cost of Manoplax had been spent on testing on humans, with
only a 'tiny proportion' spent on animal testing.
