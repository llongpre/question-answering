FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sanofi shifts centre of gravity
 -The drugs group has taken a big strategic step

Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, chairman of Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals
group, compares his company to a locomotive. After last week's deals, which
bring it the prescription drugs business of Eastman Kodak of the US and
involve the sale of its own bio-activities division, the locomotive has been
firmly shunted towards a new destination.
'It is a major strategic step,' declares Mr Dehecq, arguing that the centre
of gravity in the company would now shift squarely towards pharmaceuticals.
The group's cosmetics division, which include Yves Saint Laurent and Yves
Rocher, will remain a core business. But even here, cashflow will be used to
help finance the company's pharmaceuticals ambitions.
The bio-activities division, until last week the third pole of the company,
will be used to provide a much quicker source of finance. The businesses,
ranging from food additives to veterinary products, will be sold to pay the
bill for the Dollars 1.68bn acquisition of the prescription drugs business
of Sterling Winthrop from Kodak.
So what lies behind the strategic step? Mr Dehecq has long expressed a
desire to expand in the sector and push his group, a subsidiary of
Elf-Aquitaine, the recently-privatised oil company, into the ranks of the
world's largest pharmaceuticals groups. This week's deal propels Sanofi into
the top 20 international drugs companies, with annual sales of FFr3.2bn
(Dollars 570m) and a base in most of the world's biggest markets.
Such ambitions lay behind the strategic tie-up with Sterling Winthrop.
Formed in 1991, the alliance gave inexpensive access to markets in the US,
Latin America and Asia. But Kodak's announcement in May that it would sell
its healthcare activities to focus on core businesses signalled the end of
the alliance and gave Sanofi the opportunity to go it alone by buying parts
of its US partner.
Kodak's decision also gave Sanofi a strong bargaining position. 'Sanofi was
effectively a poison pill in Sterling Winthrop because of the alliance
agreements,' says Mr Peter Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel.
This helps explain what most analysts regard as a good price for the
acquisition. 'The amount they paid was at the lower end of what we were
expecting,' said one.
But the price will only prove reasonable if the logic of the deal can be
proved. 'We are making a bet on pharmaceuticals,' admits Mr Dehecq.
He believes the odds are tilted in his favour because the acquisition will
expand the company's direct presence in international markets, from the US
to south-east Asia, provide an outlet for products in the pipeline, and
because economies will be achieved through merging the businesses of Sanofi
and Sterling Winthrop.
'We will not be a Merck,' admits Mr Dehecq, 'but we will have a foot in the
door to market our new products.'
As for cost-savings, Mr Dehecq argues that the merging of the businesses
will provide economies not available to the joint venture with Sterling
Winthrop. Head office functions can be combined, as can marketing and
development budgets.
These synergies, he believes, combined with the profits of Sanofi's new
businesses will soon feed through to the bottom line. 'Earnings per share
should be 10 to 15 per cent higher in 1995 as a result of the acquisition',
he estimates.
Such forecasts should be welcomed at Elf-Aquitaine, Sanofi's parent, which
last Friday forecast a fall in operating profits of up to 20 per cent in the
first half of the year.
As with any important strategic decision, however, there are question marks.
In this case, many relate to the disposals necessary to finance the deal.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine, has issued strict
instructions to subsidiaries to the effect that debt must not be increased.
Neither did Elf want to see its 52 per cent stake in Sanofi reduced through
a capital increase.
As a result, Mr Dehecq must sell assets. He says he is confident that buyers
will be found for the bio-activities division, and Sanofi has already been
contacted by almost a dozen potential suitors.
With a gearing ratio of 20 per cent, and net debts of between FFr2bn and
FFr3bn, a bridging loan can be easily arranged, he says.
An additional challenge is that Sanofi is far from alone in seeking to
expand in pharmaceuticals. The plethora of recent acquisitions and mergers
in the industry are evidence of stiff competition in the sector. Mr Dehecq
argues that prescription drugs are not exposed to the low price competition
of non-prescription over-the-counter drugs and that new products over the
next few years will allow the group to expand from its newly-gained
bridgehead. That, alone, will determine whether Sanofi can stay on track.
