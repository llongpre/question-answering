FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Leaking Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Every time it seems fair to draw a line under Boots' ill-fated Pounds 900m
Ward White acquisition, something else goes wrong. The further deterioration
in the Do It All home improvement chain is just the latest misfortune. Given
that neither WH Smith nor Boots seems sufficiently confident of a cure to
pump substantial extra cash into the ailing joint venture, one wonders how
long it will be before Do It All is quietly put to sleep. At Halfords the
turnround is welcome, but it comes much too late for much credit to attach
to Boots' management. The fond hope that Halfords can double its turnover
while raising its margins fivefold also looks odd since Boots has
conspicuously failed to translate the success of its chemist chain to any
other retail area.
Unfortunately, it is not as though things were going well in
pharmaceuticals. Manoplax continues to develop complications, and it will
never make substantial profits, even if it remains on the market. Without
it, the company's new drugs pipeline resembles a rather leaky garden hose.
The group's saving grace is the Boots the Chemist chain which continues to
throw off cash at a remarkable rate. Margin growth may now be slowing, but
Superdrug's attempts to portray Boots as expensive may stick. Boots is still
trying to push up margins while others, such as Marks and Spencer, are
passing efficiency improvements on to customers to reap volume gains. Much
of that risk is reflected in Boots' discount rating to the stores sector.
Still, the fear remains that the company is strategically challenged and may
use its strong cash flows to go on another reckless spending spree.
