The market spotlight fell on Boots after the consumer products retailer
surprised the market, early in the day, with a Pounds 500m scheme to buy
back its own shares.
Turnover by the close had reached a hefty 214m shares, making it by far the
day's most actively dealt stock, as it registered a rise of 12 at 525p.
SG Warburg, the company's broker, bought a short 10 per cent of the Boots
shares for cancellation, with the lowest price paid being 528p and the
highest 535p.
The market had expected the buy-back, although several researchers had
indicated that they thought the company was only likely to make this move
after the UK budget later this month.
Warburg encountered little difficulty in acquiring the desired block of
shares. Dealers suggested that there had been many willing sellers, with one
retail specialist report-ing estimates that Warburg could have bought as
much as 30 per cent of the group's issued share capital.
Yesterday's move followed confirmation on Monday that Boots is selling its
pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group, for
around Pounds 850m. One analyst said the combination of the two developments
left the company 'flexible to make an acquisition'.
Meanwhile, analysts expect the selling institutions to pump their newfound
cash back into the retail sector.
