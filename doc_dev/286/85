BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday said local Family
Health Services Authorities had refused to give it permission to dispense
National Health Service prescriptions at outlets in two J. Sainsbury
superstores. It intends to appeal against one of the refusals.
It said the outlets, each of about 200 sq m, would continue to dispense
private prescriptions as well as Boots' range of toiletries, cosmetics, baby
products, special foods and film-developing services.
Boots set up outlets in Sainsbury stores in July as part of a trial. It said
at the launch that, if successful, the scheme would be extended nationally.
Last month the company also announced it wanted to open 240 new high-street
chemists stores by 1997.
The company insisted yesterday the operations in superstores were viable
without NHS prescription business. In spite of the rebuff from the
authorities, its shares closed 5p up at 494p on a broker's recommendation.
Boots said prescription business typically represented 20 per cent of its
stores' sales and healthcare made up 30 per cent.
Sainsbury, which proposed the collaboration, already stocks several of these
product lines in its stores. The two companies said they expected to compete
on price promotions and special offers.
The applications to dispense NHS prescriptions were turned down at
Sevenoaks, Kent, and Poole, Dorset. Boots plans to appeal over the Poole
decision but believes it would not be successful at Sevenoaks.
Applications at Sainsbury sites at Camberley in Surrey, Dulwich, south
London, Hemel Hempstead and St Albans in Hertfordshire and Ipswich in
Suffolk have not yet been made or are still outstanding.
Family Health Services Authorities, which license pharmacies, assess
applications on the basis of needs and effect on the local community.
