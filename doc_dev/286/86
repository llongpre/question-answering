BASF, one of Germany's leading chemicals companies, will make no profits
from its healthcare business this year, according to Mr Hans Uwe Schenck,
chairman of the group's Knoll drugs company.
Mr Schenck, who said Knoll was to cut its labour costs by 15 per cent, added
that his forecast excluded any charges incurred by workforce reductions. He
attributed two-thirds of the blame for the slump to the German government's
clamp on health service costs.
Knoll, which earned DM113m (Dollars 68m) net last year, will also seek
economies by reducing spending on research and development by around 10 per
cent, in contrast to the usual practice of increasing budgets by a similar
proportion.
Turnover in the nine months to the end of September had fallen 5 per cent to
DM1.48bn despite a 3 per cent increase in foreign sales which accounted for
77 per cent of the total.
Domestic turnover had dropped 7 per cent overall, although revenues from
drugs affected by a government-imposed price freeze and prescription limits
had fallen 14 per cent.
Mr Schenck protested that although drugs accounted for only 15 per cent of
the statutory health scheme's costs, manufacturers were having to bear 20
per cent of the cuts. Leading German research-based pharmaceuticals makers
had suffered falls in sales of between 9 per cent and 27 per cent in the
first eight months of the year, he said.
Mr Schenck also revealed that Knoll had stopped all research and development
work on a genetically-engineered cancer treatment, TNF, which which had not
proved 'significantly effective' in clinical trials.
