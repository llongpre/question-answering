FT  13 JUL 93 / Boardroom symptoms of a sectoral malaise: The pressure
building up on the world's drugs groups

THREE of the world's top six drugs companies have lost their president or
chief executive since March. The boardroom bust-ups are a symptom of
disarray in the pharmaceuticals industry over how to respond to the rapidly
changing healthcare environment.
The reasons for Mr Richard Markham's departure from Merck &amp; Co, the world's
biggest drugs group, are still being debated. But the other two
resignations, that of Mr Ernest Mario as chief executive of Glaxo, the
world's second largest group, and Mr Vaughn Bryson as chief executive of Eli
Lilly were clearly the result of differences within the board over the
companies' future direction.
The cause of the drugs groups' difficulties is a combination of healthcare
reform in Europe and Japan, and changes in the customer base in the US, the
world's largest market, where an increasing number of clients are demanding
ever greater discounts.
Mr Hans Joachim Langmann, chairman of E. Merck, the privately owned German
group, has lamented: 'The world is falling apart' for drugs manufacturers.
Reforms launched in Germany, the world's fourth largest market, led to an 11
per cent collapse in sales in the first four months of this year, according
to IMS International, the market research group. Overall, growth in the
European market has slowed to 1.4 per cent, compared with 8 per cent during
1992.
In the US, the changes taking place among drugs companies' customers are
probably more significant than the reforms being prepared by Mrs Hillary
Rodham Clinton and her healthcare taskforce.
Employers and individuals are grouping together to buy their healthcare in
bulk. The bulk providers, which include Medicare and Medicaid, the state
programmes for the old and poor, health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and
mail order companies, are much more cost-orientated than traditional
insurers. Known as 'managed' organisations, they are less interested in the
relative merits of drugs than their price and are able to play one drug
manufacturer off against another, negotiating substantial discounts.
Figures compiled by The Boston Consulting Group suggest the growth of the
managed sector has been explosive, increasing from 20 per cent of the
non-hospital drugs market in 1987 to 35 per cent last year. Merck reckons
that by the end of the decade 90 per cent of its American pharmaceuticals
sales will be to bulk buyers. At present the figure is about 60 per cent.
More alarmingly for the drugs groups, the size of the discounts the managed
groups can negotiate has increased from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in the
past five years. Merck has been affected by discounting more than most. Its
best selling products, heart drugs and antibiotics, all suffer from price
competition.
The net effect of the changes in the US and Europe has been tumbling volumes
and prices. As a result, brokers Wertheim Schroder reckon the average
profits growth rate in the industry will fall from 19 per cent in the late
1980s to about 8 per cent this year. Some companies will suffer a decline.
Faced with such a rapidly changing environment, drugs company boards need to
make some tricky decisions about how their organisations should adapt. It is
these decisions that appear to be causing the friction in senior management.
The implications of the deteriorating market are frightening. First, the
groups must find alternative strategies to cope with the changing US
customer base.
Second, they must decide whether to remain pure pharmaceuticals groups, or
use their scientific base to become healthcare companies. They would offer
diagnostics and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines which are less profitable
than prescription products, but generate more stable earnings.
In the US, the adjustment to managed care will be painful. Many of the
thousands of sales representatives, who used to convince doctors about a
particular medicine's effectiveness, may be made redundant. Schering'Plough
of the US reckons a third of its sales are though managed care schemes, but
require only 60 salesmen. A further 1,600 sales staff are required for the
other two-thirds.
One analyst estimates there could be between 50,000 and 100,000 job losses
in the industry over the next few years, saving the sector Dollars 5bn
(Pounds 3.3bn) a year.
Meanwhile, the debate within the pharmaceuticals groups about alternative
strategies continues. Merck has announced it will take the unprecedented
step of manufacturing generic non-patented products once its medicines'
patents expire. It has also formed an alliance with the consumer group
Johnson &amp; Johnson to market OTC products.
The irony is that many drugs groups spent the 1980s becoming pure
prescription medicine companies, disposing of their OTC and consumer brands
businesses. The sacking of Mr Mario at Glaxo may have been partly caused by
the reluctance of the board to reverse the company's policy of exiting from
OTC medicines.
With no sign of the external pressures ameliorating, more boardroom ructions
are undoubtedly in the pipeline.
