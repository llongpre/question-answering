THE DRUGS sector was alight with talk that Boots and Fisons are considering
merging their ethical drugs divisions. However, Fisons later denied the
story and drugs analysts were also dismissive. Speculation over both
businesses has been rife after they suffered unrelated setbacks over the
past year. Fisons has been hit by regulatory problems in the US, while Boots
was forced to abandon its heart drug Manoplax in July at a cost of Pounds
35m.
Boots, under pressure from anxious analysts and institutional investors over
the losses, said then that all options would be considered in reviewing the
future of its drugs business. There has been regular speculation since over
the company's likely course of action, ranging from an outright sale to a
restructuring. Any announcement on its future is unlikely to come before
Boots results on November 4. The company is also widely expected to announce
the rationalisation of its Do It All home improvement venture. Boots shares
gained 6 to 489p, Fisons 2 1/2 to 165 1/2 p.
