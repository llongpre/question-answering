FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Market frets over Boots - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS announced a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, but its shares
have underperformed the market by almost 25 per cent since January. The
share price has been knocked by City fears that the group's strategy in the
face of price competition from rivals such as Superdrug could threaten
margins at Boots the Chemist, and that problems with the US authorities over
Manoplax, a heart drug, could cut profits at Boots Pharmaceuticals.
