closer to finding a cure for the cold, writes Sheila Jones in a series on
drug discoveries

A vaccine for the common cold is a distant dream but a cure may be closer to
hand. Scientists have tried for years to fathom the mysteries of the many
viruses that cause the cold.
There have been several false dawns. The discovery in 1985 of the structure
of the rhinovirus - of which there are at least 120 out of about 200 cold
viruses - was heralded as the breakthrough that might produce a vaccine.
Some researchers said at the time, however, that its very complexity meant a
vaccine was probably impossible.
Yet, it was a breakthrough. It meant scientists could begin to think about
designing a drug that might stop the virus.
Nearly 10 years on, there is no new drug that does more than alleviate cough
and cold symptoms. Drugs are becoming more sophisticated, but none prevents
infection.
Now, there is another breakthrough. In March this year, Agouron
Pharmaceuticals, a small US company, announced it had discovered the atomic
structure of rhinovirus 3C protease (RVP), an enzyme that plays a vital role
in the lifecycle of the rhinovirus. The RVP enzyme helps the virus to do its
work as it enters the body (through the nose, eyes or mouth), producing the
symptoms associated with colds.
'It is probably the most important breakthrough since the structure of the
virus was discovered in 1985,' according to Jeffrey Almond, microbiology
professor at the University of Reading, one of the main centres of research
in the UK into the common cold.
Agouron believes the discovery will enable it to design a drug, atom by
atom, that will lock into the enzyme and inhibit or stop rhinovirus
replication. It sounds familiar, but there are some differences.
First, every virus and rhinovirus would need its own vaccine because each is
minutely different: Agouron believes the enzyme structure is common, or
similar, to at least the rhinoviruses. If it can design a drug to fit the
RVP enzyme, it could reach half of all colds.
Second, Agouron, in common with several other pharmaceutical companies, is
working with computerised drug design. Computing tools can provide important
leads in the search for the right atom to create a molecule that locks on to
a virus. The chances of hitting the right combination are greater because
scientists can try out any number of combinations more swiftly than they
could 10 years ago.
Agouron says it hopes to have a drug in the development phase by next year,
although it will be 'some years' before such a drug would be on the market.
Drugs go through years of clinical trials before they are allowed on to the
market, whether for prescription or over-the-counter sale. Initially,
Agouron plans to develop agents for treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
Agouron is not alone in the race to design a drug to kill the cold. Agouron
provided Eli Lilly, the US company, with the RVP structure in exchange for
commercial rights to anti-HIV agents produced jointly by the two companies.
Also in the picture are Japan Tobacco, the main contributor of funds for
Agouron's anti-viral research, and Syntex, a US subsidiary of Roche of
Switzerland, which is also contributing. JT has contributed Dollars 56m
(Pounds 35m) to the collaboration in the past three to four years, in
exchange for a licensing and profit-sharing arrangement. Any other company,
Agouron acknowledges, could establish the enzyme structure and design a
prophylactic drug.
Yet all researchers are aiming at an extremely difficult target, says David
Tyrell, a virologist who ran the common colds research unit at Salisbury in
the UK for 26 years until its closure in 1990. 'You need to produce
something that will kill the virus but won't also damage the delicate nerves
and tissue in the nose or cause irritation that is worse than the cold,'
says Tyrell. He points to the early optimism about interferon in the
mid-1980s. The first experiments showed that it stopped the cold but it
produced unacceptable side-effects, including nasal damage.
As the world waits for a cure, the OTC coughs and colds industry is
constantly upgrading and refining its products. Nearly two-thirds of cold
sufferers seek self-medication in a global market worth about Pounds 3.5bn a
year.
The trend in the industry is to improve what is already available. Most
cough and cold remedies contain an analgesic, such as paracetamol or
aspirin, plus one or more active ingredients to control specific symptoms.
These include decongestants such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine and
sedative antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and promethazine, to
suppress coughing and to dry a runny nose.
The industry has sought to target specific symptoms, to improve tastes and
delivery systems, to speed up and prolong treatment effectiveness, and to
produce better and safer packaging.
The industry has also produced new mixes with drugs coming off prescription
and on to the OTC market. Two years ago, the antihistamine Tavist, developed
by Sandoz of Switzerland, switched from prescription to OTC and is now an
ingredient in the company's cough and cold remedies.
Boehringer Ingelheim, which leads the German market, says it is focusing on
switching more prescription-only drugs to the OTC market following the move
to OTC of its Bisolvon cough treatment, which sells about DM245m (Pounds
102m) annually, DM45m of which is prescription-based.
Crookes Healthcare, the UK division of Boots Healthcare International,
launched ibuprofen, the analgesic, anti-pyretic (lowers temperature) and
anti-inflammatory drug onto the OTC market in 1983 as Nurofen. This year,
the company produced a new formulation - Nurofen Cold &amp; Flu tablets - the
first specific cold treatment sold OTC containing ibuprofen. The product's
other active ingredient is the decongestant pseudoephedrine. P&amp;G is also
launching in the US a patented formula in its Vicks range which is
ibuprofen-based and contains a decongestant.
Procter &amp; Gamble's recent repackaging of some products is typical of moves
under way elsewhere in the industry. P&amp;G's new Accutip packaging for its
cough products restricts the amount of liquid leaving the bottle, and
SmithKline Beecham has recently repackaged its top-selling Contac line of
cold remedies. Johnson &amp; Johnson has introduced the Tylenol FastCap, a
bottle cap that opens with a slight twist. It is aimed at elderly or
arthritic people and households without young children. Improved delivery
systems in recent years include easy-to-swallow gelatin capsules and
day/night tablets of drowsy and non-drowsy cold formulas in one package.
The market, dominated globally by a handful of international groups, is also
trying to produce better-tasting remedies, such as SmithKline's range of
Beecham powders for hot drinks containing honey and lemon. Reckitt &amp; Colman,
of the UK, now produces a range of its leading Lemsip brand, with drowsy and
non-drowsy formulas, capsules and flu strength. The company says more Lemsip
products, with known pharmaceutical agents, are being developed.
Leaders in the global coughs and colds OTC market are P&amp;G, which has about a
15 per cent share, according to industry estimates; Warner Wellcome, the
Anglo-American joint venture between Warner Lambert of the US (which
produces Benylin) and Wellcome of the UK (which makes Sudafed) with 14 per
cent; American Home Products, with about 8 per cent, and SmithKline Beecham,
which has a 4.5 per cent share (this is expected to rise to about 7 per cent
when details of SB's recent acquisition of Sterling Health are finalised).
None of the leading pharmaceuticals companies is betting on a cure, but all
are reshaping, repackaging and remixing. 'The goal is to get a cure,'
according to P&amp;G, 'but before you get there, you have to try to improve
what's available now.'
A six-part series on cancer research will start on the Technology Page next
month. The drug discovery series will resume next summer.
