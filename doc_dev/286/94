Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, is interested in acquiring a
substantial part of Eastman Kodak's pharmaceuticals businesses, either on
its own or with partners, following the US group's announcement that it
would sell its healthcare activities.
The French group, a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the recently privatised oil
group, already has a far-reaching alliance with Sterling Winthrop, the
pharmaceuticals arm of Kodak, which dates from 1991 and which is based on
the Elf Sanofi-Winthrop joint venture.
'Kodak's decision is a big opportunity for us to strengthen our
pharmaceuticals activities in a rapidly changing market,' said Mr
Jean-Francois Dehecq, Elf Sanofi chairman.
Elf sanofi said it was examining the possible acquisition of the businesses
in which it was already involved with Sterling, namely the US group's
prescription pharmaceuticals operations and its European over-the-counter
drugs businesses. It said it was not interested in Sterling's US OTC
operations, its household products or its diagnostic divisions.
Mr Dehecq said the acquisition could be done alone or with partners. 'There
are a number of possible partners,' he said, adding that Elf Sanofi was in a
strong position with respect to the sale of Kodak's pharmaceuticals
businesses because of its agreements with Sterling.
Mr Dehecq said it was too early to estimate the size of the possible deals,
but said Elf Sanofi would not need a capital increase. Instead, the company
raised the prospect of a sale of assets to help finance the operations.
'Given the size of the possible transaction, we have begun a strategic
review of business units in each of our three main activities,' the company
said, referring to its healthcare, beauty and bio-industry activities.
Industry observers said Elf Sanofi was a natural buyer for the bulk of
Kodak's pharmaceutical businesses because of their existing alliance.
Elf Sanofi and Sterling Winthrop have integrated their prescription drugs
and OTC products on a country-by-country basis. The French group controls
the European activities of the joint venture, with Sterling Winthrop
controlling operations in the US.
The stock market pushed Elf Sanofi shares down FFr43 to FFr975.
