profits to DM2.2bn

Bayer, the leading German chemicals group, expects profits to fall by about
20 per cent this year to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.3m) and remain unchanged in
1994, according to Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman.
However, the company appears likely to hold its dividend, unlike its main
domestic competitors, Hoechst and BASF, Mr Schneider hinted yesterday.
Cost-cutting measures and strong growth in north America and Asia Pacific
were slowing the profits decline as the year had advanced, Mr Schneider said
in a review of the first nine months of the current year. The trend had
continued into October, he added.
Restructuring and workforce cuts had generated savings of about DM750m so
far this year.
European sales had slumped 11 per cent, but similar proportional increases
in Asia Pacific and the US had limited the decline in turnover to just 2.3
per cent. Pre-tax earnings in the review period were 19 per cent lower at
DM1.8bn.
Mr Schneider attributed Bayer's relatively good figures - Hoechst and BASF
recently reported nine-month falls of 40 and 44 per cent respectively, and
hinted at dividend cuts - to the group's successful healthcare business.
These operations lifted sales 5 per cent in the review period to DM7bn in
spite of a DM100m fall in domestic turnover attributed to health service
reforms. Sales of Ciprobay and Adalat, the top-selling drugs, are expected
to total about DM4bn this year.
Signalling further expansion in healthcare, Mr Schneider said the group was
close to a deal which would give it an entry into the US market for generic
pharmaceuticals - drugs on which patents have expired, and which are
increasingly favoured because of their lower cost.
Bayer had looked at five or six US companies, including Copley, subject to
an offer from Hoechst.
The Frankfurt-based group is offering Dollars 550m for 51 per cent of a
company which last year earned Dollars 12.3m on sales of Dollars 52m.
Mr Schneider ruled out Bayer's building its own generics business from
scratch because the company had no experience relevant to the market, which
was entirely different from that for its traditional pharmaceuticals
business, he said.
Meanwhile, consolidation of existing operations and the search for economies
was continuing. All fibres divisions, including the troubled Dralon
business, are to be merged under one management team. However, this did not
indicate preparations for disposal, Mr Schneider stressed.
Inorganic chemicals, pigments and ceramics are to be rolled into one
operation, following the announcement of a similar plan for consumer
products and self-medication.
A small US consumer products business is to be sold off.
Personnel costs in the Bayer AG parent company had been reduced by 8 per
cent this year, Mr Schneider said. The group workforce had been reduced by
4,500 people in the period to the end of September.
