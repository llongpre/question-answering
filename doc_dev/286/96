   First Lady Barbara Bush is being treated for a
mild eye irritation that has been diagnosed as a thyroid disorder
known as Graves Disease, her office said Wednesday.
   ``Other than mild eye discomfort, Mrs. Bush has felt fine and
kept her usual active schedule,'' her press office said in a
statement.
   The statement said Mrs. Bush sought treatment after ``mild
swelling and irritation of the eyes and some loss of weight.''
   Mrs. Bush has been taking medication for four days, and has
``noticed marked improvement in her eye symptoms,'' the statement
said.
   Sondra Haley, a press aide to Mrs. Bush, said the condition,
which included swelling and watering in her eyes, was ``completely
under control.''
   ``It's not serious. It was more of an eye irritation,'' Ms.
Haley said.
   The statement said the disease is caused by the production of
excess amounts of hormones from the thyroid gland.
   It said the diagnosis was confirmed by blood tests last Friday
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center which showed ``slight elevations
of two thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothryonine.''
   Medical tests on the first lady included a thyroid scan and an
electrocardiograph, the statement said.
   Mrs. Bush is under the care of White House physicians and an
expert in tyroid disorders at Walter Reed, the statement said.
   She has been taking methimazole, a drug that blocks the
production of thyroid hormones, the statement said.
   Grave's disease is a disorder that causes the thyroid gland to
over produce the thyroid hormone. The specific cause of the disease
is not known, but it is thought to be related to a reaction of the
immune system. The symptoms can include an enlarged thyroid gland
(goiter), fatigue, heart arrythmias, insomnia, skin conditions and
fatigue. Some patients also develop swelling in tissues of the eye,
resulting in irritation, pain and light sensitivity.
   The disease can be controlled by a variety of drugs.
