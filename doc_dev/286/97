FT  21 AUG 92 / OTC sales prove addictive: Why US and European drug
companies are switching products from prescription to over-the-counter

NON-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are proving addictive for
drugs companies. By switching a drug from prescription to OTC status, sales
can be multiplied by more than five.
Take Gyne-Lotrimin, a virtually unknown prescription anti-fungal medicine
for vaginal infections marketed by Schering-Plough.
After receiving an OTC licence from the US Food and Drug Administration, the
US group launched a Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.7m) publicity campaign involving
20 women's magazines and coast-to-coast television advertising. Sales
increased from Dollars 22m in 1990 to Dollars 115m in 1991.
Monistat 7, another anti-fungal product launched by Johnson &amp; Johnson after
Gyne-Lotrimin, has done even better.
Analysts believe the two OTC medicines could eventually enjoy combined sales
of Dollars 1bn a year.
Given the success of these drugs, which had had only limited success as
prescription products, groups with so-called 'blockbuster' prescription
drugs, are now planning similar switches. SmithKline Beecham, which this
week announced a partnership in the US OTC market with Marion Merrell Dow,
has asked the FDA for Tagamet, its best-selling drug with sales of more than
Dollars 1bn, to have OTC status.
A stampede of more than 50 applications for prescription drugs to become OTC
products is likely in the US over the next three to five years, according to
the US Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association.
The accelerating pace of OTC applications is being driven by the large
number of successful prescription products whose patents are expiring during
the next five years.
Typically, when a medicine loses patent protection, competition from
unpatented generic drugs knock sales by as much as 50 per cent in two years.
But by selling the product over the counter, a group can extend the revenue
stream of its top-selling former prescription medicines.
At the same time, regulatory authorities are proving increasingly eager to
licence prescription products for OTC use, says Mr John Walden, senior
vice-president of the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association.
The main reason is cost. In the US, a prescription product will set back
patients, on average, Dollars 24. They also spend about Dollars 40 for a
prescription visit to the doctor, explains Mr Walden. In contrast, OTC
medicines cost on average Dollars 4. The combination of more sympathetic
regulatory environment and the desire of pharmaceuticals groups to exploit
the market means American OTC sales could increase from Dollars 11.6bn this
year to as much as Dollars 28bn by 2010, according to Kline &amp; Co, a
New-Jersey market research group.
Meanwhile, the highly fragmented European OTC sector is set to grow by about
15 per cent over the next three years, according to Mr James Dudley, of JMD,
the High Wycombe-based consultants.
He estimates it is currently worth about Dollars 6.8bn a year. European
governments are proving increasingly anxious to contain their healthcare
expenditure. They are encouraging the switch from prescription products -
which are reimbursed by the state - to OTC products which are paid for by
the patient, Mr Dudley says.
Pharmaceuticals groups, which previously were busy moving out of the market
because OTC medicines had lower margins than prescription products and also
required significant advertising spending, are now positioning themselves to
exploit this fast-growing sector.
SmithKline Beecham's OTC partnership with Marion Merrell Dow announced this
week is only the latest of a series of alliances.
Fast-moving consumer goods companies are teaming up with prescription
medicine groups. The consumer groups know that all but one of the top 15 OTC
medicines launched in the US since 1975 have been former prescription
products. The pharmaceuticals companies know most of them do not have the
mass-marketing expertise to exploit their medicines fully.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US's leading OTC company, formed a marketing alliance
in 1987 with the pharmaceuticals group Syntex. Johnson &amp; Johnson, the second
largest OTC group, formed an agreement in 1989 with another pharmaceuticals
group Merck to develop and develop OTC products.
Restructuring is also occurring in Europe. In 1991, Switzerland's Hoffman-La
Roche paid Sara Lee, the US group, Dollars 821m for Nicholas, its European
OTC subsidiary.
Meanwhile, Wellcome, the UK drugs group, has publicly said it is seeking a
partner for its OTC products, probably in Europe. The company has just
received an OTC licence in Germany, the world's third largest market, to
sell Zovirax, its best-selling herpes drug.
One factor that could hold back the switch from prescription to OTC is the
issue of safety. While the FDA is keen to encourage the shift, it is also
anxious not to license potentially dangerous drugs.
Marion Merrell Dow was planning to ask the FDA this year for an OTC licence
for Seldane, its best-selling anti-histamine. But its application received a
setback last month when the FDA said there had been at least four deaths and
at least 70 cases of serious cardiovascular problems associated with
Seldane.
If pharmaceuticals groups can convince regulatory authorities that their
drugs are safe in the public's hands, they could be set to exploit a
lucrative market.
