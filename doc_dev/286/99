   First lady Barbara Bush is taking medication
to control a thyroid disorder that produced an eye irritation and
caused her to joke she would have dropped a few dress sizes had the
condition gone unchecked.
   After taking the medication for four days, Mrs. Bush has
``noticed marked improvement in her eye symptoms,'' her press
office said Wednesday in a statement.
   The statement said Mrs. Bush suffers from Graves disease and
sought treatment after ``mild swelling and irritation of the eyes
and some loss of weight.''
   Mrs. Bush told a group of reporters Wednesday that she did not
know about the overactive thyroid condition until her eyes started
bothering her although she had lost about 18 pounds over the past
several months. ``The thyroid just went wacko,'' she said.
   ``I might have gone down to a size 6,'' said Mrs. Bush, who
would not reveal her new size. But then she added, ``How can any
grown-up in America be so dumb as to think weight would just fall
off?''
   ``Now, please don't have me dying,'' she joked.
   Sondra Haley, a press aide to Mrs. Bush, said the condition,
which included swelling and watering in her eyes, was ``completely
under control.''
   ``It'swas more of an eye irritation,'' Ms.
Haley said.
   ``Other than mild eye discomfort, Mrs. Bush has felt fine and
kept her usual active schedule,'' the statement said.

Reed Army Medical Center which showed ``slight

electrocardiograph.

expert in thyroid disorders at Walter Reed, the statement said.
   She has been taking methimazole, a drug that bocks the
production of thyroid hormones, the st
