   The United States and the Soviet Union are the
only two nations to acknowledge having chemical weapons, although
up to a dozen, including Libya and Iran, are thought to have the
grisly substances or the ability to make them, experts said Monday.
   President Bush, addressing the U.N. General Assembly, proclaimed
his readiness to destroy 80 percent of U.S. chemical weapon stores
if Moscow agrees to the same stockpile level, and urged other
nations to sign a multilateral pact to ban them entirely.
   Bush, however, did not suspend production of new U.S. chemical
weapons, and his offer did not appear to go beyond legislation
passed by Congress requiring the government to destroy old chemical
weapons stocks by 1997.
   Bush said more than 20 nations have these weapons or the ability
to mkake them. There was no immediate explanation of why his
estimate was higher than those offered by the experts.
   The president's proposal ``might focus international attention
on chemical weapons and lead to a multilateral treaty,'' said Lee
Feinstein of the Arms Control Association, a disarmament lobby in
Washington.
   But it may instead produce a U.S.-Soviet deal on chemical
weapons and divert attention from production by other countries, he
said.
   Private analysts believe the United States has 30,000 tons of
chemical weapons. The Soviets have said they have ``no more than''
50,000.
   Delegates to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament ended their
most recent meeting in Geneva last month without any clear idea of
when it would be possible to conclude a global ban on chemical
weapons.
   The conference, which meets again in November, is stalled on the
issue of how to monitor the production of chemical weapons, which
experts say can be made in factories similar to those that make
fertilizer or other compounds.
   ``The problem we have is that nobody has determined how to
(monitor) it in an effectively verifiable way, because chemical
weapons can be made in just about any kind of chemical plant,''
Gen. Colin Powell said earlier this year, before he was nominated
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Also in dispute are the size of chemical weapons stockpiles, and
even the number of countries that have them.
   U.S. intelligence officials have said that Libya is building the
world's largest chemical weapons plant at Rabta. Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi has said the factory is designed to produce
pharmaceuticals.
   In 1984, the United Nations concluded that Iraq had used lethal
chemical agents against Kurds along the Iran-Iraq border, although
Iraq has not admitted it.
   Other nations thought able to make their own chemical weapons
are Burma, China, Iran, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Taiwan
and probably Egypt, said Elisa Harris, a scholar who closely tracks
the issue at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   The size of the U.S. and Soviet stockpiles is not publicly
known, although those two governments last weekend signed an
agreement to exchange and verify data on their chemical arsenals,
including the right to on-sight inspection.
   The United States has disclosed what type of weapons it has and
where they are stored, but not the size of the stockpiles. The Arms
Control Association estimated the size of the U.S. stock at about
30,000 tons.
   In 1987, the U.S. government, after an 18-year moratorium, began
to manufacture a new generation of ``binary'' chemical weapons,
which consist of two toxic substances that become lethal when mixed
together.
   Congress also has ordered the destruction by 1997 of 90 percent
of stockpiles of older U.S. chemical weapons, stored at 11 sites in
the United States and in West Germany.
   Work began on Aug. 31 at the Toole Army Depot in the Utah desert
to destroy 42 percent of the U.S. stockpile, consisting of nerve
and mustard gas, blistering agents that were used in World War I.
Similar facilities were being studied at other storage sites to
destroy the remainder.
   The U.S. stockpile also consists of the nerve agents Sarin and
VX, and other substances, according to the government.
   The Soviet Union suspended chemical weapon production on Dec.
26, 1987, seven months after the United States resumed production.
Kremlin spokesmen, giving the first-ever Soviet figures on chemical
weapon stockpiles, said they contained ``no more than 50,000 tons
of chemical warfare agents.''
   U.S. estimates of Soviet stockpiles have ranged from 30,000 to
50,000 tons.
   In October 1987, the Soviets announced that their stockpile
consisted of the nerve agents Sarion, Soman, VX, two mustard
blistering agents and one irritant.
