   Vice President George Bush is taking a weekend
breather from the campaign trail after warning Ohio supporters
against complacency and boasting that running mate Dan Quayle has
been ``tested by steel.''
   Bush was keeping a light schedule today, meting with Armando
Valladares, author of ``Against All Hope,'' a harrowing account of
his years as a political prisoner in a Cuban prison. Bush mentioned
the book in his last debate with Michael Dukakis.
   Bush tonight was attending an Italian-American banquet in
Washington where Dukakis also was putting in a separate appearance.
   After taking Sunday off, Bush heads back on the road Monday for
a swing through New England, with stops in Waterford, Conn.,
Portland, Maine, and Burlington, Vt.
   On Tuesday, he launches a drive-to-the-wire, cross-country trip
for the final two weeks of the campaign, starting with a return to
Ohio for the sixth time since the GOP convention.
   In a high school gym in Lancaster, Ohio, and earlier in a hockey
arena in Troy, Ohio, Bush laid the rhetorical wood to his
opponent's policies and lauded his running mate.
   Bush said the Indiana senator has ``been tempered by steel. He's
been taking a pounding out there. Steel gets tough when it's under
fire.''
   Ohio, with 23 electoral votes, ``is a critical state,'' said
Bush.
   ``The election still hangs in the balance, and I am running _
even though things feel pretty good _ just as though I were 10
points back,'' he told 2,000 people at Lancaster High School, where
he was surrounded by cheerleaders in a gym festooned with balloons
and a huge, hand-lettered ``Good Night, Mike'' banner.
   ``He doesn't like the L-word anymore because he's trying to move
to the middle ... and we're not going to let him,'' said Bush.
   Although the Buckeye state went twice for Ronald Reagan and Bush
is ahead in polls in Ohio, Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said,
``It's not locked up by any means.''
   Tate was questioned about Friday's indictment of former
Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos, as Dukakis has criticized
Bush for praising Marcos' commitment to democracy during a 1981
visit to Manila.
   ``His view is that the judicial process should go forward,''
Tate said.
   In Troy, Bush recited his full anti-Dukakis litany, attacking
the Massachusetts governor for vetoing a mandatory Pledge of
Allegiance law, ridiculing his prison furlough program and taking a
double-edged swipe at the Democrat's economic and environmental
record.
   ``There just isn't any Massachusetts miracle. The last miracle
in Massachusetts was when they found a fish alive in Boston
Harbor,'' Bush quipped.
   At the University of Toledo, Bush decried the ``terrible
scourge'' of chemical warfare and called Friday for sanctions
against nations that resort to germ warfare, on-site inspection of
suspicious plants and an overture to the Soviet Union and China to
help stop the spread of ballistic missiles.
   Bush has long said one of his goals as president would be to
banish all chemical weapons from the earth _ an issue given new
urgency by the use of nerve gas in the Iran-Iraq war. He spoke of
his horror at seeing photographs of a Kurdish mother ``trying to
protect her child, waving her arms against the invisible winds of
death'' after an Iraqi attack.
   The Dukakis campaign has challenged Bush's credibility on this
issue, citing three tie-breaking votes the vice president cast in
the U.S. Senate in 1983 and 1986 to fund U.S. production of new
chemical weapons.
   Dennis Ross, a Bush policy aide, said the old U.S. stockpiles
were deteriorating and the new, binary weapons were safer.
   Bush's octogenarian mother, Dorothy, criticized her son after
the second chemical weapons vote in 1983 _ and got a phone call
from Reagan explaining why her George voted that way.
