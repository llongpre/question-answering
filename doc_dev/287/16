<LEADPARA>  President Bush, happy to be back in "the good old U.S. of A.," summoned his
Cabinet for a post-mortem today on the economic summit even as aides hastily
prepared for next week's superpower summit in Moscow.;    Bush headed right
back to work Monday afternoon after an 11-hour journey from Istanbul, the last
leg of a nine-day trip that saw him strike a strategic arms deal with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev in London.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He convened the Cabinet for a firsthand report on the London summit of the
world's seven largest industrialized nations, which gave Gorbachev an audience
and a promise of technical help from the West.;    Bush also was meeting with
his Commission on Environmental Quality and tackling paperwork on his first
full day back in the Oval Office since July 10.;    Aides said the president's
first formal briefings on the Moscow summit will have to wait until Wednesday,
when Bush also will play host to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe.;    Bush
had little to show for his repeated overtures in Greece and Turkey for those
two U.S. allies to settle their bitter dispute over Cyprus, the partitioned
island in the eastern Mediterranean.;    Bush backed Turkey's call for a
four-party conference to settle the Cyprus dispute, but both Greece and Cyprus
quickly rejected that idea. No government but Turkey recognizes the Turkish
Cypriot government installed on the eastern third of the island after Turkey's
1974 invasion, and the Greek Cypriots refuse to sit at the bargaining table
with Turkish Cypriots on an equal footing.;    At the White House, Bush
quickly turned his attention to domestic matters, joining actress Linda Evans
and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan in an East Room ceremony honoring 119
winners of a clean-up program called Take Pride in America.;    "It is always
nice to be back on home soil, and what better way to come home after visiting
distant lands than to recognize Americans who do take pride in America," Bush
said.  </TEXT>
