   East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel
called for keeping all nuclear weapons out of Europe in a meeting
Friday with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   That would include the new surface-to-air missile known as TASM,
which the Bush administration wants to deploy.
   ``We feel we do not need them at all, on European soil or on
German soil,'' Meckel said of nuclear weapons.
   He also said Poland should not be worried about the merger of
East and West Germany.
   ``The future Germany will have good relations with countries in
the East,'' Meckel told reporters after seeing Baker.
   The two will meet again next week in Paris when Baker, Meckel
and the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, France,
West Germany and Poland discuss Germany's future.
   The main issue is the border of Poland, which was divided
between Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II. Both West
and East Germany have told the Poles that a reunified Germany would
not expand.
   Meckel said both the merger of Germany and the border treaty
should be completed about the same time, probably in January. ``I
could not envisage a problem on what Poland requires,'' the East
German minister said.
   The United States agreed with its 15 allies at a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization summit last week in London to remove 1,470 U.S.
nuclear-tipped artillery shells once all Soviet troops are
withdrawn from Eastern and Central Europe.
   President Bush in May, at the behest of West Germany, decided
not to deploy new, short-range Lance missiles, although 700 older
U.S. nuclear-tipped Lances are in Western Europe.
   Also, 1,560 U.S. battlefield nuclear weapons are based in West
Germany and six other NATO countries, and the Bush administration
plans to deploy the more potent TASM missiles now being developed.
   Meckel said that in his meeting with Baker ``we discussed
nuclear weapons in general,'' but not the new missile specifically.
   He said Germans favor the ``zero option,'' meaning the
elimination of all short-range nuclear weapons. A U.S.-Soviet
treaty in 1987 banned all medium-range nuclear missiles.
   ``It is our strong interest to have all nuclear weapons go,''
Meckel said.
