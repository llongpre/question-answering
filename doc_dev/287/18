   The Bush administration is trying to line up Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Syria in an informal alliance to isolate Iraq.
   But Israel, long America's most reliable friend in the Middle
East, could wind up being the odd man out.
   As the United States grows closer to the three Arab countries,
its strategic dependence on Israel for such missions as
pre-positioning weapons and support facilities grows less critical.
   Egypt and Saudi Arabia, hesitant only a few years ago to be
closely identified with the United States, have been driven by
their fear of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein into unabashed ties
with Washington.
   They are ready to create a new and permanent security structure
with the United States in the Persian Gulf.
   And Syria has suddenly become candidate to join the coalition
despite its record of human rights abuses and terrorism
accusations, including sponsorship of a radical Palestinian group
suspected in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland in
December 1988 in which 280 people perished.
   Baker announced Monday at NATO headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, that he will go to Damascus to meet with President Hafez
Assad.
   The purpose, Baker said, was to explore ``how we might cooperate
to achieve what happens to be our mutual goals.''
   He said the joint aim was to isolate Saddam with a strict
economic boycott and to confront him with an international ground
and sea force.
   Baker acknowledged the United States had ``differences'' and
``difficulties'' with Syria and would discuss them with Assad when
they meet Friday. But Baker did not dwell on the terrorism and
human rights problems.
   While constructing this new alliance, the Bush administration
has begun to put more pressure on Israel to make peace with
Palestinians and to return territory Syria and Jordan lost in their
humiliating defeat in the Six-Day War of 1967.
   President Bush and Baker have revived consideration of an
international peace conference. It is an idea that drives Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir up the wall because he fears that a
Soviet-Arab coalition would force unfavorable terms on Jerusalem.
   Bush on Sunday also called for implementing ``sooner, rather
than later,'' 1967 and 1973 U.N. Security Council resolutions
providing for Israel to give up the Golan Heights to Syria and the
West Bank to Jordan.
   The president made the statement in Helsinki, Finland, at the
windup of his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It obviously pleased Gorbachev, who said the Arab-Israeli
dispute was of ``equal concern'' with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
_ ``even more,'' in fact, he said.
   Bush and Baker also have reversed the two-decade-old U.S. policy
of trying to undercut Soviet influence in the Middle East. Baker
called that approach ``old thinking.''
   Israel has been taking the administration's advice and
maintained a low profile since Iraq invaded Kuwait five weeks ago.
The United States, after all, had adopted the Israeli view that
Iraq posed a grave danger in the volatile Middle East and was
organizing a campaign designed to cut Saddam down to size.
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy met with Baker in Washington
last Thursday and emerged on a first-name basis, praising Bush and
Baker as courageous.
   ``Mr. Secretary, or rather my friend, Jim, I can go home with a
positive feeling and happy, fully believing in our possibility of
cooperating and working together,'' Levy said.
   Perhaps that spirit still prevails.
   Even as the United States proceeded with its new makeshift
alliance, former Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
recently: ``I believe the U.S. will achieve its goal and the
situation will return to what it was'' before the Iraqi invasion.
   And yet Baker's mission to Damascus after he completes talks
here Thursday with Soviet leaders will draw the United States
closer to the Arabs with unforeseen consequences for Israel.
   In the meantime, the administration's plan to isolate Iraq is
being tested by the restoration of diplomatic relations by Baghdad
with Iran.
