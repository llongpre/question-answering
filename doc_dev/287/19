   THE PENTAGON SAID Navy warplanes have begun Persian Gulf escort missions. 

   The carrier-based jets provided protection over the weekend for U.S. warships, including the USS Stark, passing through the Strait of Hormuz. 
The White House denied reports that the planes were sent to knock out Chinese-made Silkworm missiles Iran may be deploying. 
But U.S. officials said those missile sites may be attacked if they threatened shipping in the gulf, which oil-tanker sailors call "Exocet Alley," referring to the French-made missiles Iraq used in the May 17 Stark attack. 

   Iraq said its warplanes attacked a ship off Iran's coast, presumably an oil tanker, while Iran said its gunboats boarded and searched 10 gulf ships.

   Despite last week's closed-door questioning of North, most of his weeklong public testimony will be heard by investigators for the first time.
