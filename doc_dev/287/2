   Col. Moammar Gadhafi is giving his
revolution a facelift, repainting the weathered look of the radical
Arab nation that has not aged gracefully.
   The revolution turns 20 on Sept. 1 and the colonel, at a cost
estimated to total hundreds of millions of dollars, is preparing an
anniversary bash in a remodeled capital.
   However, Western diplomats say the fresh paint can't hide all
the cracks in Gadhafi's Libya. They said violent unrest in the
military around Benghazi in January killed an unknown number of
people and injured more than 100.
   Moslem fundamentalists demonstrated against Gadhafi in Tripoli
also in January and some were sent to jail. The diplomats estimate
Gadhafi's prisons now hold 2,000 to 6,000 people _ perhaps more
than when he bulldozed down the prison gates in March of 1988 in a
general amnesty.
   Oil profits are diminishing and some fields could dry up in 10
years. Diplomats conservatively estimate Libya earns $5 billion a
year and spends $7 billion to $8 billion.
   The 3{-year-old U.S. embargo on dealings with Libya, imposed by
President Ronald Reagan and recently renewed by President Bush, is
hurting. If Libya doesn't gain access to American spare parts soon,
experts say many of the oil plants will have to be replaced
entirely.
   Still, two decades after he seized power from King Idris,
Gadhafi remains solidly in control, said the diplomats, who all
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``He is very strong,'' a European ambassador said. ``That is why
he is having the 20th anniversary. There is no one to replace him
and he sees to that. He will not let anyone else have enough power
to become a threat.''
   As Sept. 1 approaches, the clean-up continues around the clock.
Thousands of workers are repaving Tripoli's old streets and
building new ones. A luxury hotel and new office towers rise along
the waterfront. Scores of new mosques and apartment buildings are
under construction.
   Everywhere painters are covering the dirty brown face of Tripoli
with fresh coats of white paint trimmed with green, the color of
Gadhafi's revolution.
   Behind the whitewash and beyond the smooth new roads are grim,
run-down apartments on littered streets. The shops and apartments
in the narrow alleys of the Arab market and the old quarter are
filthy and rat infested. Trash and garbage are crammed into
alcoves, beneath stairs and piled high in vacant lots.
   There is no open government in Libya and changes are hard to
quantify. Requests for interviews with Gadhafi or the heads of
Libyan ministries went unanswered. Many of the officials were in
Sirte, a coastal city 155 miles southeast of Tripoli, where Gadhafi
reportedly is building a new capital.
   Diplomats say the military presence appears reduced in recent
months and troops no longer patrol the airport.
   But surface-to-air missile batteries and radar stations still
are seen in Tripoli. Anti-aircraft guns jut above the now gleaming
white walls of Gadhafi's fortified compound.
   The weapons are a reminder of the U.S. air raids on Tripoli and
Benghazi in April, 1986, ordered by President Reagan in retaliation
for the terrorist bombing of a disco in West Berlin that killed an
American serviceman and a Turkish woman.
   During the last year, Western diplomats said, Gadhafi has sought
to reduce tensions with the West, mend fences with the Arab world
and loosen his stranglehold on Libyan commerce.
   He has restored ties with Egypt and opened oil negotiations with
the Americans for the possible return of U.S. oil companies to
Libya, hinting he is also ready to improve relations. American oil
companies had oil concessions in Libya worth an estimated $3
billion when Reagan ordered the embargo on Feb. 1, 1986. Oil
companies were given until June 30, 1986, to comply. Reagan's order
banned Americans from visiting or working in Libya.
   U.S. relations with Libya have been sour almost since he seized
power. The U.S. Wheelus air base in Libya was evacuated in June,
1970, and the U.S. ambassador was recalled in 1973. The U.S.
embassy was sacked Dec. 2, 1979, by radicals in support of the
Iranian revolution, and the last two American diplomats were
removed in May, 1980. In May 1981, the United States closed the
Libyan mission in Washington. U.S. interests are currently
represented by the Belgian embassy.
   Reagan ordered the embargo in 1986 because of terrorists attacks
at the Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985. The United States
blamed Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal for the attacks and accused
Ghadhafi of harboring him.
