   President Bush and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl today discussed by telephone the rift in NATO over
East-West negotiations on short-range missiles, but the United
States remains firmly opposed to such talks, Bush's spokesman said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the phone
conversation, initiated by Kohl, lasted for about 20 minutes.
   He declined to characterize the substance of the conversation,
but said Bush has not changed his opposition to early talks with
the Soviets on eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from Western
Europe.
   ``We still believe early talks would be a mistake,'' Fitzwater
said. ``Discussions that would lead to a ... de-nuclearization of
Europe would not be welcome.''
   Kohl, responding to public opinion in West Germany where the
presence of the American nuclear weapons is being strongly
challenged, has called for such talks with the Soviets.
   The issue threatens to disrupt a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit late this month.
   ``I want the NATO meeting to be a success,'' Bush said Thursday
after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. ``And
one way you guarantee success is not to go out and fine-tune nuance
differences that may exist between various staunch allies.''
   Today, Fitzwater accused the Soviets of ``assiduously'' seeking
to drive a wedge among NATO allies over elimination of the
short-range missiles.
   He said Kohl called because ``he wanted to be sure he understood
President Bush's position.''
   Asked whether the United States and West Germany were any closer
to smoothing over their differences on the issue as a result of the
phone call between the two leaders, the spokesman said: ``I would
not characterize it as moving the situation one way or the other.''
   On Thursday, Bush had voiced the administration's willingness to
negotiate with other NATO allies on the dispute.
   But, he added, ``we're not going to go for any third zero (the
elimination of the short-range weapons) or getting SNF (another
term for the weapons) out of whack in terms of negotiations. So
let's get clear on that.''
   Asked today at what point the president might be willing to
enter into such negotiations, Fitzwater replied: ``It's impossible
to define that point.''
   Instead of curbing nuclear weapons, Bush said Thursday, NATO
should put its emphasis on trying to get the Soviet Union to reduce
its overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons.
   Resolving the NATO dispute should be done privately among
members of the 16-member alliance, Bush said.
   The disagreement has clouded an upcoming May 29-30 NATO summit
called to celebrate the alliance's 40th anniversary.
   Referring to his guest, Bush praised Mulroney for giving him
``constructive suggestions'' on the matter.
   The Canadian leader did not detail those suggestions, other to
say he told Bush: ``NATO was founded on two concepts: first,
solidarity; and secondly, the American leadership of the Western
alliance. And we have to stick together on all of these fundamental
issues. And we will.''
   Canada has suggested a compromise in which NATO would agree in
principle to talks with the Soviets on abolishing the short-range
nuclear weapons while talks to erase the Warsaw Pact's edge in
conventional weapons proceed.
   Bush said the United States had made some proposals to West
Germany and ``I expect we'll be hearing from them soon.''
   White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Bush was not referring to any new proposal to deal with the problem
posed by West Germany's demands.
   Instead, he was referring to a months-old U.S. proposal for an
overall approach for NATO's defense, the officials said.
   On other matters, Bush said his administration is in the final
stages of work on new clean-air legislation that will propose
tougher standards on industrial emissions that cause acid rain _ a
crucial issue in U.S.-Canadian relations.
   Mulroney said, ``I applaud the leadership the president is
giving to the environment, particularly to the question of acid
rain.''
   Bush also said he will meet ``in the next few days'' with his
science adviser, physicist D. Allan Bromley, about claims by
scientists that they have produced nuclear fusion at room
temperature. And he voiced ``enthusiastic backing'' to demands by
Chinese students who have staged huge pro-democracy demonstrations.
