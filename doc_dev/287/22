<LEADPARA>  MIKHAIL Gorbachev's response in the new reverse arms race is even more than
"good news for the whole world." That was how President Bush rightly welcomed
the Soviet president's answer to the week-old U.S. arms initiative.;  
Gorbachev's proposals were also a challenge to begin substantive negotiations
immediately. The two leaders should waste no time while momentum is strong.  </LEADPARA>

BUSH AND GORBACHEV CAN USE ARMS REDUCTION TO DATE
AS A SPUR TO FURTHER CUTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Gorbachev not only embraced all of Bush's proposals for unilateral arms
cuts, but also upped the ante on several counts.;   The Bush administration
probably will reject some of the high bids, such as a proposed ban on
testing.;   Then Bush will appear the spoiler. But Bush could regain any lost
points by upping the ante himself. For starters, he could abandon some
positions that are logically unsupportable or that events have made obsolete.;
  One is Bush's insistence on beginning negotiations on eliminating
intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads (MIRVs) at the same
time he is asking that the Soviets accept America's Strategic Defense
Initiative and consider a similar system of their own.;   As former U.S. arms
negotiator Paul Warnke pointed out in Sunday's Perspective section, the
Soviets cannot be expected to scrap their MIRV missiles while the United
States proceeds in building a defense against those very missiles.;   The
United States should instead agree to make SDI a research-only program, and
both nations should work toward eliminating MIRVs.;   Bush and Gorbachev rate
kudos for their proposals. But both are only first steps on a long road toward
a safer world.  </TEXT>
