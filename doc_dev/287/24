   The shooting down of two Libyan jet fighters by
American military planes is just another bitter episode in eight
years of bad blood between President Reagan and Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi.
   The tone of the U.S.-Libyan long-distance relationship was set in
1981 when the new president expelled Libyan diplomats from the
United States for an ``unacceptable pattern of conduct.'' And it
continued its unyielding way through last week when, less than a
month away from leaving office, Reagan officially declared that
Libya still was not meeting ``minimum standards of human behavior.''
   The United States has shown its disgust with the Libyans'
behavior the past three years by freezing Libyan assets in this
country. A paper Reagan signed on Dec. 28 extends the authority for
the U.S. sanctions for another six months because, Reagan said,
``the government of Libya continues to use and support international
terrorism.''
   Tension between the two nations has been rising in recent weeks,
with the United States charging that Libya has built a plant for
producing chemical weapons. Libya said the factory produces
pharmaceuticals.
   Reagan said military action against the plant was under
consideration.
   At the Pentagon on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
said in response to questions about the shooting incident that the
American planes and their carrier, the USS John F. Kennedy, were not
in the area with the intention of attacking any such factory and
``had no connection whatsoever'' with it.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said, ``It may
be ironic, but the two things are not related.''
   Gadhafi called the incident an example of increased American
terrorism and said he would ``meet challenge with challenge.''
   The Libyan leader has been open about his own support for some
terrorism. In 1985, when Palestinians attacked airports in Rome and
Vienna, killing 15 people including an 11-year-old American girl,
Gadhafi called the incidents ``the most sacred action on Earth.''
   Asked about those remarks, Reagan said: ``I don't answer fellows
who think it's all right to shoot 11-year-old girls.''
   Gadhafi has been at Libya's helm since he overthrew King Idris in
1969. One of his first actions then was to close down U.S. and
British military bases.
   He nationalized most oil companies and expelled more than 20,000
foreigners, although thousands of Americans remained in Libya
working in the oil fields.
   With his oil money _ Libya remained the third-largest foreign
supplier of oil to the United States _ Gadhafi bought billions of
dollars worth of Soviet arms. He proclaimed his kinship with Fidel
Castro and the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   In December 1979, a mob ransacked and burned the American Embassy
in Tripoli in support of the Iranians who seized the U.S. Embassy
and took hostages in Tehran. Then-President Carter ordered the
embassy in Libya closed, but American oil companies maintained
business.
   In May 1981, Reagan severed diplomatic ties and in August came
the shooting of two Libyan warplanes the U.S. government said were
trying to intercept two U.S. Navy F-14 fighters over the Gulf of
Sidra.
   Three months later, there were reports that Libya had sent ``hit
teams'' to assassinate Reagan, Vice President George Bush and other
top government officials. The tightened security put in place in
Washington as a result still is in place.
   In December 1981 the U.S. halted travel to Libya and asked
Americans to leave that country. Some did, but many did not. The
following March the Reagan administration banned all oil imports
from Libya, and Exxon and Mobil withdrew their operations.
   In June 1983, the U.S. Navy staged maneuvers off Libya's coast
amid allegations that Libyans were supporting dissidents in
Western-backed Chad and Sudan. Navy jets chased away two Libyan
MiG-23 fighters.
   More shooting broke out in March 1986 when American planes
extended their operations below the ``line of death'' drawn by
Gadhafi across the Gulf of Sidra and Libyans fired six
surface-to-air missiles toward U.S. aircraft, missing them.
   U.S. aircraft retaliated by shooting and setting afire a Libyan
patrol boat and hitting a shoreline missile site. The
administration's actions were applauded by congressional leaders,
Democrats as well as Republicans.
   On April 15, American planes bombed five military targets around
the major port cities of Tripoli and Benghazi to punish Libya for
what Reagan called ``Gadhafi's reign of terror.'' He said the raid
was in retaliation for the fatal bombing of a Berlin night club and
described it as ``an engagement in the long battle.''
   There is nothing new about the U.S.-Libyan tensions. Nearly two
centuries ago, President Thomas Jefferson dispatched warships to
blockade Tripoli harbor when the ruler of Tripolitana, Youssef
Karamanli demanded $250,000 a year to prevent his pirates from
raiding U.S. merchant ships in the Mediterranean.
   Then, as now, Americans said freedom of the seas was at stake.
