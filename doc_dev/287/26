   A pro-government newspaper Wednesday
published what it claimed was a 2-year-old U.S. document calling
for the destabilization of Panama and refusal to turn over the
Panama Canal in 1999.
   The U.S. Embassy called the publication of the alleged 1986 U.S.
National Security Council document in the newspaper Critica ``an
obvious and gross falsification'' and ``a continuation of the
permanent campaign of propaganda of the Noriega regime against the
United States of America.''
   The paper said the document was ``secret and sensitive'' and
that only seven copies were made for distribution at an NSC meeting
April 8, 1986. The newspaper said President Reagan took part in the
meeting, although the reproduction of the alleged document made no
mention of Reagan.
   The reproduction of the document said, ``The basic issue is
still to guarantee U.S. control over the interoceanic waterway,
keeping it free from Soviet influence, after the year 2000.''
   It said the Panamanian government might be exposed to Cuban and
Soviet intervention after the United States turns over the canal.
   ``Reports of corruption among (some Panamanian officers) provide
an opportunity to launch a campaign to destabilize Panama and
legitimately abrogate the treaties,'' said the reproduction, which
contains several mispellings and typographical errors.
   The Panama Canal Treaties returned the Panama Canal Zone to
Panama in 1977 and call for Panama to take over the waterway itself
at the end of 1999.
   Since the United States and Panama began a dispute about a year
ago, Panamanan officials often have accused the United States of
planning to back out of the agreement.
   The United States is seeking to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who is head of the 15,000-member Panama Defense Forces and
the power behind the civilian government. Noriega was indicted in
February by a federal grand jury in Florida on drug smuggling
charges.
   The Reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions on
Panama in an effort to force Noriega's ouster.
