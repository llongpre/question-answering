   President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev held their hastily scheduled summit today,
searching for ways to forge an even closer alliance in the
international effort to isolate Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   At a break midway through the scheduled five hours of talks,
Gorbachev told reporters, ``It was a good conversation.''
   But the Soviet leader refused to divulge details, saying they
would answer questions later at a joint news conference wrapping up
the one-day summit.
   Bush, too, waved off questions as they posed for photos with
Finnish President Mauno Koivisto and their wives.
   ``You heard what the man said,'' said Bush, before heading off
to lunch with their host and his wife.
   Bush arrived first for the talks at Finland's Presidential
Palace, arranged just eight days ago against the backdrop of the
gulf crisis. It was the third Bush-Gorbachev summit in the past
nine months.
   When Gorbachev stepped into the palace's yellow salon, Bush
greeted him with a handshake and said, ``How are you, sir? I look
forward to the meeting.''
   Gorbachev gave Bush a large, framed cartoon depicting the two
leaders as champion boxers, with a fallen figure representing the
Cold War at their feet. The referee's head was a globe. The Russian
caption read, ``Knockout punch!''
   Bush laughed and said, ``That's wonderful.''
   A reporter asked the Soviet leader in Russian if he was
optimistic. ``Yes, and tomorrow, too,'' replied Gorbachev.
   The two leaders briefly stepped out onto a balcony behind a
bulletproof shield, drawing applause from a crowd of 300 people
gathered in Market Square in front of the palace.
   As a light rain fall on the misty morning, a woman in the crowd
sang ``We Shall Overcome'' in English.
   ``Much is at stake'' at Sunday's hastily arranged summit, Bush
said before his third meeting as president with the Soviet leader.
   Iraq's five-week occupation of Kuwait and its treatment of
foreign hostages dominated the agenda as the two leaders prepared
for five hours of face-to-face meetings, a lunch and a joint news
conference.
   And, while neither side gave any indication that a major new
initiative would emerge, both leaders seemed ready to renew
pressure on Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait.
   White House officials hinted late Saturday that the two leaders
may decide to issue a joint statement on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Several other subjects are likely to be discussed, including a
possible swap of U.S. oil-delivery technology for more Soviet oil
and a more sympathetic U.S. ear for Western economic aid for Moscow.
   In Saudi Arabia, a diplomatic source said Gorbachev came to
Helsinki prepared to offer the Soviet maritime fleet to the United
States to transport equipment to the Gulf and to withdraw Soviet
advisers from Iraq.
   The month-old U.S. military deployment has been handicapped by
the lack of sealift for materiel. And while the Bush administration
would like to see the Soviet advisers pulled out, it has been
low-key on the issue.
   Both leaders were upbeat about the session, which puts the two
superpowers on the same side of a major international issue for the
first time since World War II.
   ``We'll be speaking, not to some adversary, but to the leader of
a country with whom I think we're going to have increasingly
productive relations,'' Bush said on Saturday.
   Gorbachev, arriving in the Finnish capital Saturday evening,
said it was necessary ``to discuss the acute crisis in the Persian
Gulf and a number of other issues.''
   For Gorbachev, joining the United States' condemnation of Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and supporting the full naval blockade
sanction by the United Nations is a sensitive matter.
   Moscow has long been Baghdad's principal arms supplier and has
enjoyed a special relationship with the Iraqi government. Gorbachev
must also be careful not to offend the already restive Moslem
population in Central Asia.
   En route to the summit, Bush said he did not plan to ask
Gorbachev to contribute ground forces to the U.S.-led military
buildup along Iraq's border with Saudi Arabia _ even though
high-ranking U.S. officials have said such assistance would be
helpful.
   Both leaders arrived under overcast skies and received matching
red-carpet greetings from Finnish President Mauno Koivisto, who had
lunch with Bush and dinner with Gorbachev.
   It was a working summit for both leaders and they did little in
the way of recreation or sightseeing. Security was extremely tight,
as always, and Soviet, American and Finnish flags were flown
together. Crowds lined the streets as the U.S. and Soviet
motorcades passed by and people forked over $20 for T-shirts with
the faces of Bush and Gorbachev superimposed on that of Saddam.
   Except for a brief stop to shake hands in a downtown Helsinki
market district and a short visit to the U.S. embassy, Bush spent
much of his time in his hotel suite meeting with advisers.
   White House officials said the administration would have no
reaction to Saddam's six-point message to both leaders. It was not
clear whether Bush watched the address, broadcast on Cable News
Network and available to him in his hotel suite.
   Bush was also to meet on Sunday with a trade mission of U.S.
business executives here on their way to Moscow.
   The two leaders last met in Washington in early June. Their
first summit was at Malta last December.
