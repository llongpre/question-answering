   ALMA ATA, U.S.S.R. -- The U.S. moved rapidly to close out
its political accounts with the old Soviet Union, and now is
beginning to open economic accounts with the new system
taking shape here.
   The old was ushered out when the Bush administration and
the Soviet government agreed to end the bitter, decade-long
struggle over Afghanistan. The new was ushered in when
Secretary of State James Baker began offering U.S. help to
the newly independent Baltic states.

   The process continues today here in the big Asian republic
of Kazakhstan, where Mr. Baker began talks last night.
Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has emerged as
a leader in the wrenching process of negotiating a new
relationship between a sharply diminished Soviet central
government and newly assertive Soviet republics. Equally
important, he has been a Soviet trailblazer in enacting
free-market economic reforms -- the kind that the Bush
administration considers essential to making permanent the
changes now sweeping over the country.
   Mr. Baker's aides say he will encourage speedier progress
along the economic-reform road Mr. Nazarbayev has paved,
though they insist the secretary will avoid discussing any
specific project while here.
   In the eyes of U.S. business leaders, however, Kazakhstan
is particularly important because it is the site of a
proposed big joint business project under which Chevron Corp.
has agreed to develop the Tengiz oil field. Chevron would
work with other U.S. companies to recycle some of the oil
earnings into other development projects. But the deal ran
into bureaucratic resistance before last month's failed coup
attempt, and business leaders now will watch its progress as
one gauge of whether the post-coup Soviet system is better
prepared to handle foreign investment.
   Meanwhile, disposing of the old U.S.-Soviet political
business is turning out to be remarkably easy. Virtually the
last major U.S.-Soviet foreign policy sticking point was
freed when Mr. Baker and new Soviet Foreign Minister Boris
Pankin agreed on Friday on a joint cutoff of arm supplies to
the warring factions in Afghanistan and a plan for free
Afghan elections.
   The Afghan agreement continues a process in which Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev is clearing the decks of any
political irritants in hopes of facilitating U.S. offers of
economic aid.
   Mr. Gorbachev had earlier granted independence to the
Baltic states and announced his intention to begin
withdrawing Soviet troops from Cuba, thereby eliminating two
other big irritants. And he and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin
also made it clear that they intend to move to settle a
lingering dispute with Japan over conflicting claims to the
Kuril Islands.
   But opening new economic links is proving to be a delicate
matter, both because of the emotional debate raging over the
shape of the new Soviet political system and because of
severe limits on U.S. finances.
   Mr. Baker began the process over the weekend with a
whirlwind tour of the three new Baltic states, which just 10
days ago won their independence from the Soviet Union. Mr.
Baker announced that the U.S. is offering Lithuania, Estonia
and Latvia a total of about $14 million in aid for the
remainder of the current fiscal year, which ends this month.
The aid is to be divided equally, meaning each of the states,
whose independence the U.S. championed for 50 years, will get
less than $5 million apiece.
   That modest offering will be followed by an unspecified
amount of aid from a pool the Baltic states will have to
share with struggling Eastern European nations that also have
lined up for help from the U.S. in making the transformation
to free-market economy.
   Aware that it is offering only modest direct aid, the Bush
administration is trying to help the struggling Baltics in
some other areas. It intends to unfreeze some gold reserves
and small amounts of other Baltic assets that the U.S. has
held since the three republics were forcibly incorporated
into the Soviet Union in 1940. That will provide about $30
million in gold reserves for Estonia and about $23 million in
gold for Latvia, but only a few hundred dollars for
Lithuania.
   In addition, the U.S. said that it will push for full
membership for the Baltic states in the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, and will act quickly on
legislation designed to give the Baltics permanent
most-favored-nation trade status with the U.S.
   Beyond that, Mr. Baker and his aides are pushing the
Soviet Union, its republics and the newly independent Baltic
states to agree on something Mr. Baker calls a "common
economic space." Under that concept, the 15 former Soviet
republics, regardless of their political relationship with
each other, would agree on a plan for economic coordination
that would reduce the chances of their sinking separately
into economic chaos and to make it easier for the West to
work with them jointly to join the free-market system.
   After five days of talks here, Mr. Baker and other
officials are more confident a coherent system will emerge.
"There is a certain new realism," said a senior U.S.
official. "One does not see a retreat from the importance of
the republics having a clear identity and establishing
independence. But one hears a recognition of a single
economic space and a need to come to grips with that."
