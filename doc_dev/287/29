   President Bush said Friday he will dispatch
Vice President Dan Quayle on a fence-mending trip throughout Latin
America in an effort to counter negative reaction to the U.S.
military invasion of Panama.
   ``To some degree I am concerned,'' about that reaction, Bush
told a White House news conference. ``Because I am well aware of
how our friends south of our border, including my friend President
(Carlos) Salinas (of Mexico) look at the use of American force
anywhere. So I am concerned about it.''
   Quayle's agenda and the timing of the trip were still being
decided, said his press secretary, David Beckwith. The only country
that was definitely on his schedule was Honduras, where he already
had planned to attend the Jan. 27 presidential inauguration. At
least seven Latin heads of state are expected to attend and Quayle
could lay the groundwork for the rest of his visits in meetings
with them.
   Bush indicated he recognizes Latin sensitivity to what
historically has been seen as a heavy-handed U.S. policy toward
Central and South America, including military interventions in
years past, toppling of leaders and installation of governments
friendly to the United States.
   ``I view this as very, very important diplomacy,'' the president
said of Quayle's trip.
   None of the Latin countries voiced support for his Dec. 20
invasion of Panama, and many of them strongly condemned it. Peru
went so far as to withdraw in protest from the upcoming drug summit
with Bush in Colombia. It later reversed course and said it would
send a representative.
   The Organization of American States overwhelming passed a
resolution deploring the invasion, with only five absentions from
countries who wanted a condemnation of Noriega as well to be
included in the resolution.
   Bush insisted, however, that the negative feeling that has
resulted from the invasion is ``something that's correctable,
because I think they know that I have tried a lot of consultion,
that we have exhausted the remedies in this particular case of
multilateral diplomacy.
   ``But given the history of the use of U.S. force, I would be
remiss if I didn't face up to the problem that we must go forward
diplomatically now to explain how this president looks at the
protection of American life, that we acted, in our view well within
our rights, but that we will continue consultation.''
   He said Quayle ``will be in a position to explain very clearly
not only U.S. policy, but our aspirations for Panama, and indeed,
for this entire hemisphere.''
   He said the Latin nations must understand the invasion was
motivated by ``the protection of American life.''
   Asked if he was reverting to old U.S. policies that have upset
the Latin countries for years, Bush said that Quayle's trip ``takes
on enormous importance to convince the people of the truth.''
   ``We are not reverting to just a willful ... use of force that
has no rationale,'' he said. ``But when it comes to the protection
of American life, please, our friends south of the border,
understand that this president is going to protect it.''
   Bush noted that the U.S. military intervention that drove
Noriega from power was well-received by many of the Panamanian
people themselves.
   ``It has been overwhelming,'' he said of the Panamanian response.
   Although no timetable has been set for Quayle's trip, it will
force postponement of a Feb. 4-11 European journey the vice
president had been planning. He was to have visited several
countries to consult with U.S. allies.
