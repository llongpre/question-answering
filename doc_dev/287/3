   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev complained
to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday that a 2{-month-old
U.S. foreign policy review threatens the momentum of arms control
talks, a Soviet spokesman said.
   President Bush ordered the review after he took office in
January. It is still under way, and Bush has said he will not be
``stampeded'' by Soviet initiatives.
   ``In general we are not happy with the West's answer _ or maybe
non-answer _ to Soviet initiatives in the field of disarmament,''
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told
reporters after Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher met for four hours.
   ``We understand that the new administration needs time to study
foreign policy because there are new faces there and some of them
don't know what foreign policy is about,'' he said.
   But he said Gorbachev told Mrs. Thatcher the Soviets ``don't
want this pause to become an interval which will lead to losing
momentum in this process of disarmament.''
   ``But still I think overall we must say that the atmosphere for
disarmament talks is extremely favorable now,'' Gerasimov said.
   East-West negotiations began in Vienna last month on reducing
conventional weapons in Europe, but U.S.-Soviet negotiations on
reducing long-range nuclear weapons have been postponed
indefinitely.
   The Reagan administration aimed for a 50 percent reduction in
strategic nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines. But an
agreement was blocked by Soviet concerns over the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative and difficulties over verifying compliance with
an accord.
   Gerasimov said Gorbachev did not specifically ask Mrs. Thatcher,
a staunch U.S. ally, to take up the Soviet concerns with Bush. ``We
just expressed our concern,'' he said.
   Asked what the Soviets believed was causing the delay in
formulating U.S. foreign policy, Gerasimov said his view was that
the Bush administration was trying ``to please everybody.''
   The Soviets also ``feel a certain influence'' of old Soviet
hands like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and
former U.S. National Security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, ``who
tend to interpret Soviet-American relations in terms of
confrontation,'' he said.
