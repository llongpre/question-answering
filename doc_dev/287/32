   President Bush said Thursday he would not
accept any agreement to resolve a crisis in NATO if it would lead
to the abolition of short-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe.
   Rather than curbing nuclear weapons, Bush said NATO should put
its emphasis on trying to get the Soviet Union to reduce its
overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons. He said
negotiations should be conducted outside the public spotlight to
resolve the NATO dispute.
   Against the wishes of the United States and Britain, West
Germany has demanded the opening of negotiations soon with the
Soviet Union to curb short-range nuclear weapons. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl also opposes U.S. and British efforts to more than triple the
range of NATO's Lance missiles to about 250 miles.
   The dispute threatens to rupture the harmony of a NATO summit
May 29-30 that is intended to showcase the strength and unity of
the Western Alliance.
   ``I want the NATO summit to be a success, and we will be working
with the Germans and with others to see that there is a common NATO
position,'' Bush said. ``This is no time for one to compromise or
somebody not to compromise.''
   Bush said, ``I'm always willing to negotiate. But we're not
going to go for any third zero (the elimination of the short-range
weapons) or getting SNF (another term for the weapons) out of whack
in terms of negotiations. So let's get clear on that.''
   The president made his comments in an informal question and
answer session outside the Diplomatic entrance of the White House
after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Canada is circulating a compromise in NATO that calls for
negotiations with the Soviets on short-range nuclear weapons with
the understanding all Lances would not be uprooted and the Warsaw
Pact's edge in conventional forces would be erased. The deal would
permit modernizing the missiles first.
   Mulroney stressed the need for NATO members to stand together,
and credited solidarity and American leadership for the strength of
the alliance.
   ``And so, while there has to be this kind of debate, in the end,
there must be solidarity, total solidarity,'' Mulroney said. ``And
there must be a common view of leadership, which has served the
world so well for 40 years.''
   Referring to NATO, Mulroney said, ``This is not an association
where everybody freelances. We have a common NATO position, and
while there are divergence of views that emerge from time to time,
the object of getting together is to harmonize those views into one
position.''
   Bush said he felt the dispute should be resolved in quiet
negotiations.
   ``There's a lot of public discussion of this issue, and that's
fine,'' Bush said. ``I don't plan in detail to join in on that
public discussion.''
   Bush said the United States had made some proposals to West
Germany and ``I expect we'll be hearing from them soon.'' White
House officials said privately that Bush was not referring to any
new proposal to deal with the problem posed by West Germany's
demands.
   Rather, Bush was referring to a months-old U.S. proposal for an
overall approach for NATO's defense, the officials said.
   On other matters at the news conference, Bush:
   _ Said he will meet ``in the next few days'' with his science
adviser, physicist D. Allan Bromley, about claims of producing
nuclear fusion in a jar of water.
   _ Gave his ``enthusiastic backing'' to demands by Chinese
students who have staged huge pro-democracy demonstrations.
   _ Said he was in the final stages of working on stricter
acid-rain standards that would be part of overall clean air
legislation. For his part, Mulroney said, ``I applaud the leaership
the president is giving to the environment, particularly of the
question of acid rain.''
   _ Warned of unspecified action against Panama if there is fraud
in Sunday's election. ``The world will be looking at them, not just
the United States, in terms of these elections and deciding what to
do if the elections are fraudulent.''
