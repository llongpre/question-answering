   A 44-year-old airplane carrying Allied ambassadors
flew from Frankfurt to Berlin to highlight celebrations marking the
airlift that fed 2 million city residents during a Soviet blockade
40 years ago.
   Among the passengers Thursday was one of the Berlin Airlift's
original pilots, dubbed ``Raisin Bombers,'' who said that out of
fairness he droppped candy and raisins to children in both the
Communist and Western halves of the city.
   ``The Berlin Airlift changed this city, and it changed the
world,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt said of the June
1948-September 1949 operation which delivered more than 1.8 million
tons of food and vital supplies to Berlin's Allied-controlled
western sectors.
   Accompanying Burt on Thursday on the DC-3, a civilian version of
the military C-47 transports used during the airlift, were British
Ambassador Sir Christopher Mallaby, French Ambassador Serge
Boidevaix and West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz.
   Long-time Berlin resident Helga Galler, 60, was among the 400
people waiting for the landing at Berlin's Templehof airport. She
said she recalled well the shortages and feelings of hopelessness
created by the Soviet blockade.
   ``Everything was in short supply _ food, clothing, everything,''
Mrs. Galler said. ``So when we saw these planes coming, we knew we
didn't have to worry any longer.''
   ``I don't what we would have done without them,'' Mrs. Galler
said.
   At the end of World War II, Berlin was divided into Soviet,
U.S., British and French sectors. The city was surrounded by
Soviet-controlled territory that later became East Germany.
   Bitter disputes between the Kremlin and the United States,
Britain and France led to the Soviet move to cut all Berlin off
from the West.
   Specifically, Soviet leader Josef Stalin was staunchly against
the creation of a unified German state in the three Western
occupation zones, and when the Western allies backed a currency
reform to speed up Germany's economic recovery, Moscow imposed the
blockade.
   Retired Air Force Col. Gail Halvorsen, who accompanied the
ambassadors on the plane, was the first to begin dropping raisins
and candy to Berlin's children to sweeten the supplies they were
already receiving.
   Halvorsen, 67, said that once during the airlift days he
received a letter asking why no candy was dropped over Berlin's
eastern sector.
   ``So I flew over East Berlin after that and started dropping
candy there too,'' he said.
   But after one such run, Halvorsen said, ``an officer came up to
me and asked what I was doing. He told me the Russians had
complained that we were trying to influence the thinking of the
kids over there, so I had to stop it.'' Halvorsen, who was a
27-year-old U.S. Army Air Force lieutenant when he started flying
Berlin Airlift missions in July 1948, said he flew a total of 126
roundtrip missons from July 1948 to February 1949, taking off from
the U.S. Rhine Main base near Frankfurt.
   He later became commander of the U.S. Air Force at Tempelhof Air
Base from 1970 to 1974. He has since retired from the military and
makes his home in Provo, Utah.
   Halvorsen said he first had his crew throw out candy to children
waiting at Templehof Airport.
   ``There were only about 30 kids gathered at the airport'' on
that run, he said. But the idea spread like wildfire, and soon
there were thousands of children throughout the city waiting for
sweets to be tossed out of airlift planes, which were quickly
dubbed ``Raisin Bombers.''
   When the Soviets blocked off Allied access to the western
sectors of Berlin in 1948, they also cut delivery of electricity
and food from Berlin's communist-controlled eastern sector.
   In response, the Allies officially announced the Berlin Airlift
on June 26, 1948. By the time the airlift ended on Sept. 30, 1949,
more than 277,000 planeloads of food and supplies had been brought
to the former German capital.
