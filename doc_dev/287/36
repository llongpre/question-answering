<LEADPARA>  President Bush met with African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela today
to discuss the upcoming talks to write a new, non-racial constitution for
South Africa. Mandela emerged from the White House to say he had "a very
constructive conversation with the president" about the political situation in
South Africa. Bush lifted the five-year-old U.S. sanctions against South
Africa on July 11. Mandela is seeking to interest U.S. corporations in future
investments in South Africa but opposes an immediate end to all international
sanctions.  </LEADPARA>
