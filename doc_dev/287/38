<LEADPARA>  After reading "Shackling free trade," criticizing President Bush for derailing
the North American Free Trade negotiations off the fast track (Editorials,
Dec. 13), I couldn't pass up the opportunity to defend the president's
decision. This has been the first time that George Bush and I have been in
agreement -- albeit for very different reasons.;   At a time when unemployment
continues to soar and all economic indicators point to a continuation of
current recessionary times, the president faces an all-time low approval
rating in poll after poll. Given his current dilemma, it should come as no
surprise that the president has ground the free trade negotiations to a halt.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     President Bush is simply acknowledging what the rest of us in labor,
church, community and environmental organizations have known: that the free
trade agreement would mean the final erosion of our country's manufacturing
base accompanied by the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Moreover, that
such an agreement will also mean a dramatic erosion of U.S. environmental
standards.;   Regarding job loss, even business leaders and the government
have conceded that any agreement will result in job loss as U.S. companies
shift their production to lower-cost Mexico. In Canada, a country where wage
and environmental regulations are far more harmonious with those of the United
States, the Canadian Labour Congress reports the number of jobs lost as a
result of a two-year-old U.S.-Canada free trade pact at 226,000.;   Advocates
of such agreements argue that while workers may temporarily lose on the deal,
at least consumers will benefit from the reduction in manufacturing costs. But
a look right here in our own back yard proves this is a phony argument. When
Green Giant started moving frozen vegetable production from its plants in
Watsonville to a plant in Mexico, its labor costs dropped from $7 per hour to
$4 per day. The last time I checked, that bag of frozen peas and corn sure
didn't seem any cheaper than it was a year ago. How many consumers out there
are anticipating a net savings on frozen food products down the road?;   Even
more devastating will be the impact such an agreement has on U.S.
environmental as well as health and safety standards. Following the logic of
unfettered free trade, a country that imposes limits on pollution will be
creating a barrier to free trade. In Canada, we have already seen court
battles arising from the Canadian asbestos industry against U.S. environmental
protections. Even if we as consumers were guaranteed a savings in the
marketplace, I don't believe we are willing to return to the industrial dark
ages to save a few pennies.;   You said that the benefits of free trade should
be apparent. Benefits for whom? Free trade is not about the relationships
between countries, but rather about the relationships of transnational
corporations. While a free trade agreement certainly benefits these interests
in the form of lower production costs, it fails to bring benefits to workers
and consumers on both sides of the borders.;   U.S. workers and consumers
would lose as jobs and environmental protections become our country's biggest
exports, while Mexican workers would face increased exploitation from
transnational corporations operating above the restrictions of any national
protections and regulations.;   Make no mistake, the president has not
suddenly had a change of heart. The overwhelming evidence of the negative
impact of a free trade agreement on jobs and the environment has not suddenly
reached the Oval Office. But what has hit the Oval Office are the cries of
hundreds of thousands of working men and women who have taken an economic
beating over the past 12 years from supply-side economic policies -- policies
which have overwhelmingly resulted in less for the many and more for a few.;  
At a time when the victims of these policies are no longer just a few poor,
"undeserving" Americans, but an increasing portion of the American middle
class, the Bush administration cannot afford to continue down its current
path. At stake for George Bush is losing the 1992 presidential election. At
stake for our country is the erosion of an economic middle -- a middle class
which as been both the backbone and underpinning of any great democracy.;   --
