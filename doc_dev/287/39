   From among the baffling and infuriating elements of the U.S.-Iran arms connection, one lesson comes through that isn't lost on anyone in the Middle East: 

   For a year or longer, the U.S. has been rewarding militarily its most strident and implacable Middle East foe, Iran, while its best Arab friends, Egypt and Jordan, have been battling, largely unsuccessfully, to get extra military help. 

   The Reagan administration apparently was ready and willing to bend the law to send planeloads of arms to Iran, a country that has promoted the seizing of American hostages and almost hourly declares its hatred for the U.S. 
But at the same time, it resisted bending bureaucratic procedures to give cash-strapped Egypt, a country that openly promotes American interests in the Middle East and cooperates militarily with it, badly needed relief from the high interest rates Egypt is paying on old loans for American arms. 

   To be sure, there are signs that the U.S. may be prepared to give limited relief on Egypt's military payments, though far less than what Egypt wants. 
Egypt now pays 12% to 14% interest on its $4.5 billion in old U.S. military-sales loans, plus an additional 4% penalty for being a year behind on its payments. 
Egypt, in the throes of an economic crisis exacerbated by the oil slump, wants these high interest rates cut. 

   Under a plan awaiting approval by the White House, sources say, Egypt would pay 7.4% interest, cutting annual debt servicing on its U.S. arms loans to about $350 million from $540 million. 
The rest of the interest wouldn't be forgiven but only deferred for 25 years; Egypt also would have to pay interest accrued on the deferred payments. 
All told, Cairo would end up paying about $10 billion more, the sources say. 

   Even if the Egyptians get this limited help after their long wait, it will appear that the Reagan administration was prepared to bend laws and regulations for an outlaw state but insist on playing by the book for a friend -- even if that friend is a strategically important country like Egypt going through an economic crisis. 

   The U.S. has dragged its feet in helping Egypt because doing so would set a precedent for others with U.S. loans. 
There is also resistance because a straightforward rate reduction, as Egypt has requested, would cost the U.S. Treasury about $2 billion in interest payments it had been counting on. 

   Jordan finds itself in much the same boat: Despite its friendship with Washington, the U.S. this year backed away from a plan to sell Jordan "defensive weapons," even while sending those same kinds of arms to Iran. 
Jordan had hoped to get, among other things, Hawk and Stinger antiaircraft missiles, but was rebuffed in part because some congressmen feared those missiles could fall into the hands of terrorists. 

   Now Jordan has seen Hawk missiles sold clandestinely to Iran and shoulder-fired Stingers sent secretly to Afghan guerrillas. 
The Reagan administration pleaded that it couldn't buck congressional resistance to Jordan's arms request; yet now Jordan knows the Reagan administration was prepared to directly defy congressional wishes in sending arms to Iran. 
A source close to Jordan's King Hussein says he has "never seen him so bitter." 

   Nobody should be surprised if the Iranian mess seriously restricts Washington's ability to play its traditional role as a strong and honest broker in Middle East disputes. 
Nor should anyone be surprised that King Hussein has decided he can protect himself best by making amends with radical Syria and buying arms from the Soviet Union, or that Egypt is making new overtures for financial and trade links with the Soviets.
