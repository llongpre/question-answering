   Pro-government and opposition labor
leaders at separate May Day rallies demanded Monday that the United
States lift its trade embargo on Nicaragua.
   ``We're asking that the United States lift the embargo because
those who suffer are not the Sandinista leaders, but the workers
and the people of Nicaragua,'' said Alvin Guthrie, president of the
opposition Confederation for Labor Unification.
   He spoke to about 4,000 demonstrators opposing the leftist
Sandinista government who later marched for two hours through
working-class neighborhoods of Managua under a sweltering midday
sun.
   Earlier Monday, about 20,000 pro-government demonstrators
gathered at the Plaza de la Revolucion in Managua's former downtown
area, destroyed by a 1972 earthquake.
   Lucio Jimenez, secretary-general of the Sandinista Workers
Union, condemned the 4-year-old U.S. economic blockade and accused
``reactionary Nicaraguan capitalists'' of impeding the country's
industries.
   He praised the government's call to investors to help reactivate
Nicaragua's paralyzed economy, warning them this was their chance
``for continuing to live or disappear.''
   Victor Tirado, one of the nine members of the Sandinista
National Directorate, told the rally peace won't come to Nicaragua
until the United States stops supporting the Nicaraguan rebels,
known as Contras. Last month Congress approved a $49.7 million
package of non-lethal aid for the Contras, most of whom are living
in jungle camps in neighboring Honduras.
   The United States cut off all financial aid to Nicaragua in 1981
after alleging the Sandinista government was supporting leftist
insurgents in El Salvador. In 1985, then-President Reagan imposed a
commercial embargo on this Central American country, saying
Nicaragua had established close military ties with Cuba and the
Soviet Union.
   Private buiness people say the embargo isn't halting the flow of
U.S.-made goods to Nicaragua and only makes parts and equipment
more expensive to acquire because they have to route the items
through a third country.
   Economists say the government's 3-month-old austerity program is
showing results in slowing hyperinflation that topped 20,000
percent in 1988. But they say those same measures have created a
recession that could prove fatal to the economy if allowed to
continue into the planting season. The season traditionally starts
in mid-May, the beginning of the rainy season.
   President Daniel Ortega is on a 10-country European tour to ask
for more financial aid for Nicaragua. Sweden, the main West
European supporter of the 10-year-old Sandinista revolution, has
organized a Stockholm conference May 11-12 so Ortega can present
his case before potential donors.
