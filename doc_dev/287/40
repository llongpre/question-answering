   TOKYO -- When Japanese officials explain Japan's desire
for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council,
they are likely to invoke an old U.S. rallying cry: "No
taxation without representation."
   Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa won't utter those words in
his speech to the Security Council today. But he will try to
get that message across.

   Mr. Miyazawa will speak only in general terms of the need
to update parts of the U.N.'s 47-year-old structure, Foreign
Ministry officials say. "We don't want to appear
self-serving," says one official. But the Japanese hope other
nations will get the hint, giving momentum to their
longstanding quest for a permanent seat.
   Japanese officials regard Security Council membership as
an important tool for persuading Japanese voters to shoulder
broader international responsibilities. Many Japanese have
the feeling, reinforced during last year's Persian Gulf War,
that their nation is treated as merely a "cash dispenser," as
one Japanese diplomat says. As the Security Council hammered
out Gulf resolutions, Japan was reduced to asking council
members to share notes, he says. When plans for liberating
Kuwait were drawn up, Japan was asked to provide much of the
funding.
   Still, ministry officials say they are prepared for
several years of quiet, Japanese-style consensus-building to
win a seat. Changes in the council's structure "need careful
consideration," because any alterations in the U.N.'s charter
would be likely to prompt calls for other changes, one
official says. Some countries want to open the council more
widely, giving Germany and perhaps India or Brazil permanent
seats. Even such basic issues as the veto right of the
permanent council members could come under attack.
   The U.S. has called on Japan to go beyond "checkbook
diplomacy" and take a broader role in world affairs. But when
asked about Japan's aspirations for a Security Council seat
during his recent visit to Asia, President Bush said that
changing the U.N.'s charter would be "extraordinarily
difficult" and said the U.S. hasn't advocated Japan over
other countries interested in a seat.
   Another complicating factor is Japan's post-World War II
Constitution, which is interpreted as prohibiting its troops
from engaging in foreign combat. The government has tried
since the Gulf crisis to pass legislation allowing Japanese
forces to join noncombat U.N. peacekeeping operations. But
the legislation stalled in the Diet last year, and it is
given little chance of passing in the current session.
   Although Japan contributed $11 billion to the effort to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait, Tokyo was obliged to stipulate that
the money be used for non-combat expenses such as food and
housing for the troops. Foreign Ministry officials say they
don't believe the Constitution prevents Japan from supporting
U.N. resolutions that entail the use of force as long as
Japanese personnel aren't involved. But the officials concede
that failure to win passage of the peacekeeping bill could
hurt Japan's case for a permanent Security Council seat.
   Japan would also like to eliminate a clause in the U.N.'s
charter that refers to World War II enemies of the Western
allies. Many Japanese regard that clause's continued presence
as a symbol of the reluctance of the U.S. and Europe to
accept Japan as a full partner.
