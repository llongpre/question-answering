   Art from Cuba is exempt from the trade embargo,
say artists, galleries, scholars and a civil liberties group who
are suing the Bush administration for banning it.
   The lawsuit filed June 5 charged that the Treasury Department is
violating a 1988 law that excludes paintings, sculpture and
drawings by Cubans from the 27-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba's
goods. The suit said the department has infringing on the First
Amendment.
   ``Paintings are as much a part of the First Amendment as books.
They are not, as the administration would have it, commodities like
Cuban sugar or tobacco,'' said Michael Krinsky, a lawyer for the
National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.
   Joining with the NECLC in the legal action were the New
York-based Center for Cuban Studies, several artists, art scholars,
galleries and private collectors. Sotheby's and Christie's auction
houses also joined as ``friends of the court'' in support of the
plaintiffs.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, asked
that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control be
required to permit Cuban art works to be brought into the country
under the ``free trade in ideas'' act, adopted by Congress in 1988.

   ``The Godfather, Part III,'' one of the most
talked about movies of the year, has finished principal photography
in Italy, New York and Atlantic City.
   The last in a trilogy about the fictional Corleone family poses
a challenge for filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola since both ``The
Godfather'' (1972) and ``The Godfather, Part II'' (1974) won best
picture Academy Awards.
   But Paramount Pictures thinks it might have yet another winner.
   ``We are excited by the incredible look, texture and intrigue of
the continuing saga,'' said Sidney Ganis, president of Paramount's
Motion Picture Group.
   ``The Godfather, Part III,'' which is scheduled for release at
Christmas, begins in 1979. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is trying
to legitimize the family's dirty money. He's moved from gambling
and casino operations to real estate and media.
   The film began shooting in Rome on Nov. 27, 1989. It ended May
25.
