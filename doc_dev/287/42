   A strong earthquake struck Romania
today, killing eight people, injuring 260 and heavily damaging
buildings in Bucharest and other cities across much of the country,
police said.
   The temblor was felt in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Greece,
Turkey and Bulgaria, but of those only the Soviet Union reported
casualties.
   Six people were reported injured and buildings were damaged in
the Soviet republic of Moldavia near the Romanian border. A Soviet
lawmaker said initial reports from the region indicated there were
an unspecified number of deaths.
   In Romania, some people were killed or injured by large chunks
of concrete and plaster that fell from buildings onto sidewalks and
streets. Several people in Bucharest were hurt when they jumped
from windows or balconies.
   Thousands of frightened residents in the capital city of 2.2
million people fled into streets as buildings swayed and cracked.
   Romania's General Inspectorate of Police said two people died in
Bucharest, two in the Danube River port of Braila, and one each in
the cities of Buzau and Brasov, and in the Ialomita and Prahova
counties, north of the capital.
   The inspectorate reported 260 people injured, 45 critically. It
said 35 of the critically injured were in Bucharest, where 138
people were hurt.
   Elsewhere, it said, 51 people were injured in Braila, 21 in Dolj
in the southwest, 20 in Prahova, 12 in Ialomita, 10 in the eastern
county of Galati, 7 in the nearby county of Constanta bordering on
the Black Sea, and one in Buzau.
   An earlier erroneous police report said 42 were injured in
Brasov.
   In Calarasi County in southern Romania, the ceiling of a major
electrical steel plant crashed to the floor, the state news agency
Rompres reported.
   In Golden, Colo. the U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake
measured 6.5 on Richter scale. Its epicenter was 100 miles north of
Bucharest, in the wooded Vrancea range of the Carpathian mountains.
   The earthquake struck at 1:40 p.m. (6:40 a.m. EDT) and rumbled
across the Carpathians, which run through eastern Romania, the
western border of the Soviet Union and southwest Poland.
   In Bulgaria, the state BTA news agency said the temblor was felt
nationwide but there was minor damage only in Silistra, a town on
the border with Romania. A nuclear power plant in Kozlodoui on the
Danube river was closed.
   In the Soviet Union, the quake knocked out telephone lines and
shook buildings in at least three of the country's 15 republics:
Russia, the Ukraine and Moldavia.
   In Ottawa, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said when asked
about the earthquake: ``Everything is OK. There was no devastation,
no destruction.''
   Six people were hospitalized in Kogul, near the Soviet Union's
border with Romania, said Lt. Ivan Koltuk of the regional Interior
Department.
   ``The quake was really strong. Everything and everybody was
falling,'' said Alexander Yevchenko, a local official. Buildings
were damaged in Izmail, Bolgrad, Reni, Kogul and Komrat, Soviet
officials said.
   The quake also shook buildings in Moscow, 1,000 miles east of
Bucharest, and was felt as far north as Leningrad. U.S. officials
closed the older U.S. Embassy, which is 10 stories tall.
   ``It's an old building, and when the upper floors shook we
called around other places in town and closed the building as
precaution to do safety checks,'' said embassy spokesman Jim
Bullock.
   One of the two people killed in Bucharest, shop assistant
Petruta Lungu, died when she was hit by a collapsing balcony as she
ran outside after the quake struck, police said.
   The Fire Department said two small fires were reported in
Bucharest, one in an apartment and another in the chemical
laboratory of a high school.
   Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert of Glasgow, Scotland, staying in an
apartment in a 10-story building in Bucharest, said: ``The walls of
the bedroom crumbled with plaster falling. Stuff came flying off
shelves and all the plaster came off the ceilings. Outside there's
a massive crack in the building.''
   Elena Chibzui, 56, who was in her sixth-floor apartment in
central Bucharest, said: ``I'm very scared, and I could hear shouts
in the neighboring apartment.'' Her building suffered only a minor
crack.
   Doina Stoica, a 22-year-old student, said: ``I was scared. I was
in a book shop and the first thought was to get my mom and get out
on the street.''
   Michel Desprats, 24, a French journalist at the Bucuresti Hotel,
noticed the chandeliers in the marble lobby swinging. ``In panic, I
followed all the people out of the hotel and people were all
shouting and crying,'' he said.
   Inside the hotel, which suffered structural cracks on almost
every floor, small chunks of plaster littered the carpet.
   In Vienna, the Austrian Seismological Institute said the
epicenter of the quake appeared to be located in Romania's Vrancea
range of the Carpathians.
   This was the third major earthquake in Romania since 1977. The
other two were also centered in the Vrancea range and the most
serious, on March 4, 1977, killed 1,500 people.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by a
quake as measures by the ground motion recorded by seismographs.
   Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in
magnitude.
   A powerful earthquake struck Soviet Armenia in December 1988,
killing an estimated 25,000 people and leveling buildings in
several villages and cities.
   An earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale struck the San
Francisco Bay area Oct. 17, 1989, killing 67 people and injuring
more than 3,000 others.
