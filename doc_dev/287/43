   It took three refueling stops for Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to get to Indonesia on his 30-year-old
U.S. Air Force jet. But as slowly as he treks through four nations
in Asia, he is only an electronic holler away from his command post
at home.
   Baker's plane has parallel telephone and printed message
systems, both equipped with scramblers for confidential
conversations and sensitive exchanges. They nearly always work.
   A couple of weeks ago, while stretching his legs at the airport
in Shannon, Ireland, while the jet was refueled, Baker was taken
aback by reporters whose editors had just told them of the deal
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had struck in Moscow clearing
the way for German unification.
   The terms reached with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
surpassed anything Baker expected to see accomplished when he got
to Paris for six-nation talks in Germany. ``Terrific, terrific,''
Baker told reporters, recovering quickly.
   ``The fact of the matter,'' Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger said Wednesday, ``Baker should have had a heads-up. The
guy at the airport who had the information missed connections with
Baker because Baker was taking a walk.''
   Eagleburger, who takes over as acting secretary of state when
Baker is abroad or on vacation, is only a telephone call or an
electronic message away from the jet or from the headquarters Baker
establishes when he reaches his destination.
   ``It works,'' Eagleburger said in an interview. ``I suppose if
they are off at a dinner in Paris and something develops it is
going to take longer to get in touch. But it works. The
communications on the plane are fantastic.''
   Most of the material Washington sends to Baker is dull. Routine
reports are transmitted, to be scanned by assistants traveling with
him, as well as wire service reports and press clippings.
   ``He doesn't leave the State Department behind,'' said another
U.S. official. ``There is a sort of constant back and forth. And
yet there is a tendency not to overburden him.''
   One reason Baker can breathe easy is his comfortable
relationship with Eagleburger. Their backgrounds are as different
as Houston, Baker's hometown, and Stevens Point, Wis., which
Eagleburger left for college, the Army and then a career in the
foreign service _ with time out for four lucrative years as a
Washington consultant.
   At the start, Eagleburger had Baker's permission to join any
meeting he wished _ an offer Eagleburger accepted more often at the
beginning.
   ``On this, Baker has been superb,'' Eagleburger said. ``I think
I've got a pretty good sense of where he is going to come out on an
issue. If I am in doubt I try to get a hold of him and find out.''
   This doesn't happen too often.
   For a National Security Council meeting Wednesday at the White
House, he substituted for Baker without consulting him on the issue
at hand. Eagleburger would not disclose the topic President Bush
took up that day with his closest advisers.
   Eagleburger prepared by holding his own sessions first at the
State Department.
   ``This is a case, by and large, you represent the department
unless you know the secretary disagrees with what the department's
view would be,'' he said. ``In this case I assure you he would not
disagree.''
   And then there is the crisis situation.
   Last December, as Bush, Baker and Brent Scowcroft, the
president's national security assistant, flew together on Air Force
One to Malta for a summit meeting with Gorbachev, army rebels
mounted a coup in the Philippines. The future looked bleak for
U.S.-backed President Corazon Aquino.
   She prevailed after two U.S. jet fighter planes from Clark Air
Base provided air support for government troops, buzzed rebel
positions and otherwise made sure the dissidents knew on which side
Washington stood.
   During the crisis, Eagleburger was in the State Department's
Operations Center, the guarded communications hub. Vice President
Dan Quayle and Robert Gates, the former CIA official who is
Scowcroft's deputy, were at the White House.
   ``We had a hookup, and then the vice president was on the
telephone with Baker. That's an example of where we were able to
make decisions based on where the powers were _ namely, on the
airplane,'' Eagleburger said. ``We didn't have to wing it from
here. The communications were fine.''
   Pausing for a moment, Eagleburger continued: ``That was a
decision to use American military forces. These are not the kinds
of decisions you make on your own, without the president.''
