   U.S. Coast Guardsmen trained for
Caribbean drug interdiction have been added to Navy ``boarding
teams'' enforcing the economic embargo of Iraq, U.S. military
sources said Thursday.
   The Coast Guardsmen arrived in the Persian Gulf region this week
and are aboard several of the 27 U.S. ships patrolling the gulf,
the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, the sources said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The combined teams of five to 10 Navy and Coast Guard members
carry sidearms and M-16 assault rifles when they board ships,
usually from small boats.
   The teams question ships' officers and ask to inspect the cargo.
If one is found to have Iraqi connections, the ship may be
``diverted'' to another port, said the sources.
   They said U.S. warships have intercepted about 170 ships and
boarded at least 10 in the gulf and Red Sea since President Bush
issued his Aug. 16 order aimed at strangling Iraq's economy and
war-making potential.
   While most were allowed to continue, the sources said, Navy
boarders found at least two with Iraqi-related cargo and induced
them to alter their sailing plans. ``Usually this means they are
asked to return to their port of origin,'' said a gulf-based source.
   One ship, a Chinese freighter, went to a southern gulf port
after a team from the cruiser USS England found it was carrying
Iraqi fertilizer. The sources said they could not provide details
on the other ship.
   ``Challenging'' a ships' identity and destination is a routine
naval practice in peacetime.
   Most interceptions occur in the Persian Gulf and its gateway,
the Strait of Hormuz. Others have taken place in the approaches to
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba, a key port used to import goods
destined for Iraq.
   According to Lloyds Shipping Intelligence service in London, a
number of ships have been turned away there and at least one was
boarded in recent days but allowed to proceed.
   The U.S. sources said there have been no incidents of resistance
or shooting since Aug.18, when two American missile frigates fired
warning shots in an attempt to stop a pair of Iraqi tankers exiting
the gulf.
   Still under surveillance, the tankers reached the Yemeni port of
Aden on the south Arabian peninsula, where they remain anchored,
the sources said.
   Yemen has denied the ships unloaded at Aden.
   The sources said no other Iraqi oil carriers have been sighted
moving to or from Kuwait or southern Iraq since the firing
incidents.
   Since that incident, it was reported that Iraqi officials had
instructed ship captains not to resist challenges by U.S. and other
warships, a move that analysts saw as possibly eliminating one key
potential ``trigger'' for war.
   The Coast Guard was brought into the gulf operation because it
has men specially trained to board and inspect ships at sea, said
Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan, a Coast Guard spokesman in New York.
   He said the teams sent to the gulf were veterans of the
7-year-old U.S. drug interdiction program in the Caribbean, where
they also operate from Navy ships.
   Neither Milligan nor military sources in the region could say
how many Coast Guardsmen were assigned to the gulf.
   British defense sources were unable to say how many
interceptions or boardings had been carried out by the three Royal
Navy warships in the gulf, or whether they had found any with Iraqi
cargo.
   In another development, military sources said two Australian
missile frigates have arrived in the gulf, bringing the total
number of warships directly involved in the multinational blockade
force to at least 32. Three Italian, six French warships are also
en route.
