<LEADPARA>  U.S. and Soviet officials reached an agreement in principle on changes in the
Soviet copyright law, acting on U.S. complaints that have delayed action on a
year-old U.S.-Soviet trade agreement.;    At a meeting in Moscow last week
with U.S. copyright experts, Soviet officials agreed to meet all of the
specific U.S. demands on changes in the law, according to a U.S. official at
the meeting.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Soviet law, passed May 31, was intended to stop rampant piracy in the
Soviet Union of movies, records and software but fell short of what the
Soviets had previously said they would do.;    After lobbying from movie
studios and other copyright-sensitive industries, the Bush administration
delayed sending the trade agreement from Congress, citing its provisions on
intellectual property rights.;    Once approved by Congress, the trade
agreement would effectively grant most-favored nation status to the Soviet
Union, lowering tariffs for Soviet goods.  </TEXT>
