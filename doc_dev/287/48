   President Bush publicly endorsed a shift in
U.S. policy toward Third World debt, backing a proposal by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady for partial forgiveness of outstanding bank
loans to developing nations.
   Bush's approval of the plan, announced Tuesday night after a
meeting of the National Security Council, ended a period of White
House caution toward the debt-reduction scheme outlined by Brady
last Friday.
   The plan calls for commercial banks to forgive some of the $410
billion in debt run up by developing nations, mostly in Latin
America.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater had said Bush did
not want to react to the new proposal, which supplants a four-year
old U.S. policy of opposition toward debt forgiveness, too hastily.
   However, he said, after reviewing the proposal with the security
council, ``the president fully supports the concepts and processes
for debt reduction and economic growth outlined by Secretary Brady.''
   Fitzwater said the new policy also is supported by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III as well as the Federal Reserve system,
which reportedly had expressed some reservations to it.
   The new policy modifies a plan outlined in 1985 by then-Treasury
Secretary Baker calling for banks to issue new loans to developing
nations that instituted economic reforms, without forgiving any of
the outstanding debt.
   However, the ``Baker plan'' resulted in little in the way of new
bank loans to heavily indebted Third World nations.
   The new policy reflects a Bush administration decision to view
debt-reduction as a national security issue as well as an economic
one, particularly in the aftermath of riots in Venezuela aggravated
by austerity programs forced by that nation's debt burden.
   Brady's plan calls for banks to forgive part of the outstanding
debt by using money from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund as collateral.
   The plan also envisions banks swapping some of the debt for bonds
of lower face value.
   Brady unveiled the proposal last week in a speech to a conference
sponsored by the Bretton Woods Committee, a group devoted to
international economic issues.
   The plan was widely applauded by the international banking
community and by leaders in both debtor and creditor nations.
   However, the reluctance of the White House to back the plan
publicly when it was announced led to speculation of divisions
within the government over details.
   The security council decided that ``this was the best way to
proceed'' Fitzwater said, after what he said was a difficult
discussion at which a variety of viewpoints were expressed.
