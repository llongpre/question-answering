<HEAD>Air Force Times: Minuteman 2 Won't Be Eliminated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Bush administration has rejected an Air
Force proposal to scrap 450 aging Minuteman missiles because it is
reluctant to reduce U.S. strategic forces in advance of
negotiations with the Soviet Union, according to a published report.
   The Pentagon declined comment Tuesday on the report appearing in
this week's edition of The Air Force Times, an independent
defense-oriented newspaper, that the missile retirement proposal
was ``turned off by the White House.''
   Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon spokesman, said: ``Mr.
Cheney offers advice to the president, and we don't talk about it.
Any advice that he has give will be evident when the budget is
released.''
   The single-warhead Minuteman 2 missiles, one of the oldest U.S.
strategic weapons systems, were deployed beginning in 1965 at three
bases spread across thousands of miles _ Ellsworth Air Force Base,
S.D.; Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo. and Malmstrom Air Force Base,
Mont.
   Retirement of the three missile wings was proposed to save about
$400 million a year in response to a White House directive for deep
cuts in the Air Force and other service budgets.
   The missiles are less accurate than others in the U.S. arsenal,
take 36 hours to switch targets and, according to published
reports, have shown signs of deterioration.
