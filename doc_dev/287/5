Says New Moscow Embassy to Be Studied

   Trying to limit political damage from a sex and spy scandal at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, President Reagan said the U.S. will study whether its new embassy under construction in Moscow can be made secure or whether it should be razed. 

   President Reagan, in a televised news conference yesterday afternoon, said that he wouldn't allow the Soviets to occupy their new embassy on a hill in northwest Washington until the U.S. is certain the new Moscow embassy is safe against Soviet eavesdropping. 

   But the president's announcement represented more symbolism than substance. 
While President Reagan announced that former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird will chair a new commission to oversee all of the investigations now being conducted into the Soviet embassy security scandal, the administration already had launched five related inquiries. 

   Further, an existing agreement bars the Soviets from moving into their new embassy until the U.S. moves into its new facility. 
And some Soviet diplomats already have moved into the residential section of the new hilltop complex, and some U.S. diplomats have moved into a separate housing compound adjoining the new embassy in Moscow. 

   The $191 million U.S. Embassy building, still under construction by the Soviets, is believed to be so riddled with listening devices, including some in its steel structure, that it may be impossible to make secure. 

   President Reagan didn't say whether the U.S. will demand that the Soviets pay for rebuilding the bugged embassy and refused to cancel Secretary of State George Shultz's Moscow trip next week. 

   "I just don't think it's good for us to be run out of town," Mr. Reagan told reporters at the unusual afternoon session. 
National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci told reporters that Mr. Shultz will have a secure room and secure communications at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow during his meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. 
The two are expected to cover a wide range of issues including arms control and espionage. 

   The White House has been looking for opportunities to give the president a higher profile as an aggressive leader since the Tower Commission faulted his hands-off management in its report on the Iran-Contra scandal. 

   The Reagan administration also said yesterday that it lodged a formal diplomatic protest with the Soviet Union over disclosures that Soviet female workers allegedly enticed U.S. Marine guards into allowing Russian spies into the old U.S. embassy. 
The administration also protested the Soviets' extensive eavesdropping on U.S. diplomats. 

   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, calling Moscow's behavior "a breach of the norms of diplomatic conduct," said the protest was filed in the Soviet capital by Ambassador Jack Matlock. 

   The department said that five U.S. contract workers who had replaced Soviet workers at the embassy have returned to the U.S. 
Two were recalled for violations of regulations, including prohibitions on fraternizing with Soviet citizens; two returned for medical reasons, and one was fired for unspecified violations. 

   So far, two U.S. Marine guards have been accused of allowing Soviet agents into the embassy where they are believed to have had access to the most tightly secured areas, including communications equipment. 
U.S. officials currently are interviewing other Marines who had been stationed in Moscow. 

   Reps. 
Dan Mica (D., Fla.) and Olympia Snowe (R., Maine), who are currently inspecting the existing and the new embassy in Moscow, have said the existing facility has been "fully compromised" and that it would cost tens of millions of dollars to correct the damage.
