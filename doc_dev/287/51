<DESCRIPT>  PHILIPPINES; PRESIDENT; US; MILITARY; FACILITY; AGREEMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  In a compromise move, Philippine President Corazon Aquino announced Wednesday
that her government would give the United States three years, rent free, to
withdraw military forces from Subic Bay, the largest U.S. naval base in Asia.;
  U.S. Embassy officials here were guarded in response, saying the offer --
far less time than they had hoped -- would be studied in Washington. A 1994
pullout would end nearly a century-old U.S. military presence here.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     10-year plan scrapped; In a rare news conference, Aquino said her
government had abandoned plans to hold a controversial national referendum
that she had urged to support a 10-year lease extension. The extension, agreed
to by Philippine and U.S. negotiators, was rejected by the Philippine Senate
on Sept. 16.;   Instead, Aquino told reporters she would "negotiate and
execute" an executive agreement with the United States "for the withdrawal of
the United States military forces within a period not exceeding three years.";
  In Washington, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney called the decision "a
tragedy for the Philippines.";   "If the three years is their decision for
withdrawal, then we're willing to conduct ourselves accordingly," he told
reporters after meeting with House Republicans.;   Aquino assures support;
Aquino said 15 of the 23 members of the Philippine Senate had pledged to
support the plan, including four members who voted last month against the
10-year extension. Under that arrangement, which Manila called a treaty, the
United States was to pay $203 million a year for use of the huge Subic port
facility and the adjacent Cubi Point air base.;   Frank Drilon, Aquino's
executive secretary, said U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner had assured the
government that the United States "will accept the decision of a sovereign
state." He said committees from the two governments would meet soon to begin
planning the base phase-out.;   But U.S. Embassy officials declined to confirm
that. "At the moment we're just taking a look at it," one diplomat said.
"There's still a lot of unanswered questions. What we have is a presidential
announcement of an intention to do something."  </TEXT>
