   A leading Soviet chess player who
secretly married the U.S. team captain and defected during the Chess
Olympiad flew to the United States with her husband, a U.S.
Consulate spokeswoman said today.
   Susan Elbow of the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt said Elena
Akhmilovskaya, the second-ranked player on the Soviet team, and her
husband, John Donaldson, left on a Pan Am flight late Tuesday.
   Ms. Elbow said she did not know the couple's destination in the
United States.
   Donaldson, the U.S. chess team's non-playing captain, married Ms.
Akhmilovskaya on Friday during the international tournament in
Athens. The 31-year-old U.S. international master is from Seattle.
   The couple arrived in Frankfurt on Saturday to wait for an
immigrant visa for Donaldson's wife. It was received Tuesday.
   The couple met during a chess tournament in Cuba in 1985.
   Apparently fearing the reaction of Soviet team officials, they
decided to leave Greece before the end of the Olympiad after news of
their wedding became public.
