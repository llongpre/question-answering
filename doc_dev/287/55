   The Pentagon will present the Bush administration
with a proposal to test a giant laser weapon modified so that it can
destroy enemy satellites, according to a published report.
   The proposal could spark controversy, because some members of
Congress and others oppose the development of anti-satellite
technology on the grounds that it could escalate the arms race.
   The laser, named Miracl, was designed to shoot down enemy
missiles and has been tested successfully at the White Sands Missile
Range in New Mexico. But now the Air Force is preparing to engage in
anti-satellite tests, which could occur as early as this year, The
New York Times reported Sunday.
   A duty officer at the Pentagon said Sunday there would be no
immediate comment on the report.
   To conduct the tests, the device must be modified so its beams
are steady enough to be focused on objects hundreds of miles away.
Experts say the modification will be relatively easy, but the laser
will have to be tested before anyone knows whether it can actually
destroy satellites. It will be tested on old U.S. satellites, the
paper said.
   The decision to upgrade the laser was made early last month by
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, and was reported in the Dec. 19
issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology.
   However, the military must receive White House approval before
the device is tested on satellites. President-elect Bush has given
no indication of his position on the issue.
   Gen. John Piotrowski, commander in chief of the United States
Space Command, has said that the Soviet Union has lasers capable of
destroying American satellites and that the United States' lack of
such equipment is a ``grave detriment to our national security.''
   Paul Stares, a research associate at the Brookings Institution,
countered that the planned laser could ``undermine the general
improvement in U.S. and Soviet relations, as well as progress in
arms control.''
