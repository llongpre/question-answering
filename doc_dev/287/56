   Mikhail S. Gorbachev broke the mold of dour,
intransigent Soviet leaders during his first foray onto the world
stage, and he's been surprising now-wary Western counterparts ever
since his 1985 summit with Ronald Reagan.
   Based on his past performance, there's every reason to believe
that the 58-year-old Gorbachev might spring a surprise on President
Bush when the two meet off Malta on Dec. 2 and 3 _ so much so that
White House officials say extensive preparations are under way to
prepare the American president for anything that might be thrown at
him.
   Gorbachev's reform policies in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe have been surprising enough to Americans. His style leans to
the unexpected, as well.
   When Gorbachev and Reagan posed for pictures at the start of
their meeting in Geneva four years ago, the American president kept
mum, heeding his advisers' counsel not to take a chance on spoiling
the atmosphere of his first U.S.-Soviet summit with an offhand
remark.
   The Russian showed no such caution.
   When a reporter told Gorbachev he had been described by a fellow
Soviet official as a man with a nice smile but iron teeth,
Gorbachev replied: ``I'm still using my own teeth, but as to the
substance of your question, both the president and I have good
grounds to believe we can have a good talk.''
   Later the same day, after his tete-a-tete with Reagan stretched
well beyond the carefully choreographed schedule, the Soviet leader
broke a comment blackout imposed by both sides. ``I think we will
have a good relationship,'' he said.
   At the last snap summit, in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986, the
United States went prepared to negotiate the framework for a treaty
reducing intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Gorbachev instead
proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons in all categories.
   Reagan took him up on the challenge, and the two men engaged in
what was later described as history's highest-stakes poker game,
seeing and raising each other one weapons category after another
until they stumbled over the last chip: Reagan's beloved Star Wars
plan.
   The American refused to concede; the Soviet insisted it was all
or nothing. And nothing it was.
   Bush's advisers have let it be known the new U.S. president will
not let himself be drawn into a game like that at the summit off
Malta.
   But as recently as last May, when Secretary of State James A.
Baker III went to Moscow expecting to set a date for the next
U.S.-Soviet summit, Gorbachev caught the new foreign policy chief
off guard with a bold new offer of substantial cuts in conventional
forces in Europe.
   The initiative broke a years-old logjam over how to count and
reduce the two sides' non-nuclear ground and air forces in Europe.
But it embarrassed Baker, who was unprepared for such a move, and
gave Gorbachev a public relations coup.
   Bush, facing criticism that he was slow and indecisive in
developing a policy toward the Soviet Union, recovered at the end
of the month with his own conventional arms proposal announced at a
NATO summit in Brussels.
   But six weeks later, Gorbachev pulled another trick out of his
hat.
   As the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies
gathered in Paris for their annual economic summit, they received a
letter from Gorbachev appealing for entry to the world economic
community.
   After decades of cold war and economic rivalry, the Soviet chief
wrote that his effort to restructure the Soviet economic and
society ``is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and
entire participation in the world economy.''
   His letter instantly became the central focus of the summit
talks.
