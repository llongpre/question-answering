   Benazir Bhutto claimed victory today
in Pakistan's first free national elections in more than a decade,
and the 35-year-old U.S.-educated politician was poised to become
the first woman to lead a Moslem nation.
   Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party held a commanding
lead in Wednesday's balloting, and thousands of her supporters
danced in the streets outside her family villa.
   With 190 of 205 districts reporting, Ms. Bhutto's party had a
plurality of 85 seats, and its main rival, the right-wing Islamic
Democratic Alliance, had 50. The rest went to independents and minor
parties that will likely emerge a critical factor in forming a new
government.
   About 30 political parties fielded candidates, but the campaign
boiled down to a race between the People's Party and the nine-party
Alliance, which includes loyalists of the late military strongman
Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.

   A landlady suspected in the deaths of seven
tenants whose bodies were unearthed in the yard of her rooming house
was arrested, five days after she disappeared while police searched
her property, officials said today.
   Dorothea Montalvo Puente, 59, was taken into custody Wednesday
night by Los Angeles police who tracked her to a downtown hotel on
the basis of a tip provided to a television station.
   Police believe Puente killed tenants who lived in her Sacramento
boarding house to collect their Social Security benefits. They have
a list of two dozen people who are missing and who might have lived
at Puente's eight-bedroom house at one time or another.

   Estonia's parliament struck an
unprecedented blow for independence for the Baltic republics by
declaring sovereignty and the right to veto Soviet laws. Lithuanians
prepared to debate similar action.
   The Kremlin had no immediate reaction to Wednesday's move by
Estonia's Supreme Soviet.
   Estonia's Supreme Soviet passed the declaration of sovereignty by
a 258-1 vote with five abstentions after a day of restrained debate.
Legislators argued that too much Soviet control has ruined the
economy and environment and that Estonia must control its own land,
factories and laws.
   The declaration stopped short of complete independence. But it
called for a treaty with Moscow that would ``determine the further
status of Estonia in the composition of the Soviet Union.'' About
two-thirds of the republic's 1.6 million people are ethnic Estonians.

   For the final state dinner of their eight-year
White House reign, President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, were hosts
of a nostalgic night of song and dance to honor their conservative
friend, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Breaking protocol, Mrs. Thatcher and her husband, Denis, dallied
Wednesday after the evening's entertainment and took a turn with the
Reagans about the marbled Grand Foyer to the tune of ``Shall We
Dance?''
   Usually, the honored guests depart posthaste, but the Thatchers
and the Reagans even switched partners as they smiled for the
cameras. ``I wanted this to be special _ it's very sentimental,''
said Mrs. Reagan, who said she got ``a little teary'' during the
effusive round of toasts that the president and prime minister
offered each other earlier in the evening.
   With their 55th state dinner, the Reagans closed the book on one
of their favorite White House events.

   An unprecedented joint appearance by two men
frequently described as the respective ``fathers'' of the Soviet and
American hydrogen bombs featured sharp disagreement on whether
space-based defenses would bring world harmony or nuclear war.
   Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet scientist who has become his nation's
foremost human rights activist, said deploying such a defense system
would ``destabilize the world'' and could trigger nuclear war
between the superpowers.
   Edward Teller, one of the principal American advocates of
deploying the Star Wars defense system, said it could lead to a
``world neighborhood'' of cooperation and peace.
   The two scientists aired their views Wednesday evening at a
banquet honoring Teller as a pioneer in the field of nuclear physics
and for his advocacy of the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. It
was sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative
research group.

   Americans hoping to live tobacco-free were determined to butt out
of smoking today in the 12th annual Great American Smokeout as
celebrities stressed the message: You're a fool if you think smoking
is cool.
   ``I started smoking at 14 because I thought it was chic,'' said
actress Celeste Holm, who with other stars at New York City's
Lincoln Center on Wednesday urged participation in the smokeout.
   ``I didn't know it would kill you. Now we know better.''

   Justice Department officials have postponed
initial indictments in the massive Pentagon purchasing fraud scandal
while they debate whom to charge first.
   ``We expect action in the very near future but not this week and
probably not next week,'' said Sharon Dibbley, spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson in suburban Alexandria, Va., where the more
than 2-year-old investigation is headquartered.
   Last month, Hudson and Justice sources predicted that the first
indictments would be brought by mid-November, but now the best
estimates are that the grand jury will vote on charges either very
late in November or in early December.
   A source at Justice Department headquarters said Wednesday,
``It's still being reviewed here, over legal issues.''

   Social Security benefits to people born before
1917 are higher than Congress intended, but there's no practical way
to fix the inequity, a study concludes.
   Congress should neither reduce benefits to those getting the
unintended windfall nor raise them for everyone else, said the study
released Wednesday by the non-partisan National Academy of Social
Insurance.
   ``I would strongly hope that this issue can be put to rest'' as a
result of the report, said Suzanne Dilk, a former senior analyst
with the Social Security Administration and one of four experts on
the study panel.
   In a related development, lawmakers and lobbyists reacted angrily
to a draft government proposal that would make it harder for the
elderly, disabled and poor to appeal government decisions denying
them welfare or Social Security benefits.

   Severe textbook shortages are undercutting
education in urban school districts nationwide because of higher
book prices, budgetary constraints and a tendency to cut books
before people, educators complain.
   ``One of the things about textbooks is they don't vote and they
don't go out on strike. If you cut personnel, you get screams of
anguish,'' said Harriet Tyson-Bernstein, author of ``A Conspiracy of
Good Intentions: America's Textbook Fiasco,'' a new book highly
critical of the textbook industry.
   A study of 31 schools in five urban districts by the
Washington-based Institute for Educational Leadership, released in
September, found an across-the-board lack of instructional
materials, including textbooks.
   ``In general, the resource situation is pretty bleak. The lack of
supplies in the school systems is pretty obvious,'' said Lisa
Walker, policy resource director for the private, non-profit think
tank. ``This is often an area of the budget where funding is cut.''

   Earthlings who dream of reaching out and touching
extraterrestrial beings can thrust their voice and image billions of
miles into space by making a special long-distance call.
   By using ``space phones'' set up today through Saturday in the
AT&amp;T building's atrium, the public will have a chance to communicate
with someone who could hear their voice long after they're dead,
said AT&amp;T spokesman Brian Monahan.
   About 30 hours of recorded audio-visual messages will be beamed
to outer space by the telephone company's satellite dishes from
Thanksgiving to New Year's during the early morning hours when they
aren't being used for business.
   Monahan said AT&amp;T has 30-meter dishes across the country aimed at
communications satellites, and one or two would be realigned to beam
the radio waves.
