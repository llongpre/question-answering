   The United States does not plan to protest the
detention of U.S. military observers by Soviet officers in East
Germany last week, an incident the Pentagon revealed Tuesday to
have been the fifth of its kind in the past year.
   Five Soviet military observer teams were detained by Western
military forces in West Germany over the same period, said Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams.
   Asked whether the detentions amounted to tit-for-tat events,
Williams said, ``I am only reporting the facts.''
   In announcing that the Pentagon had no plans to protest the
latest incident, Williams said, ``No one senses that they were
unreasonably detained.''
   A U.S. officer and non-commissioned officer were held for 7{
hours near Halle, about 80 miles southwest of Berlin, and a tire on
their car slashed with a bayonet.
   The detention took place Friday on the eve of President Bush's
summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but it was not
made public until reporters made inquiries in Washington on Monday.
   Williams, adding fresh details during a briefing Tuesday, said
the U.S. soldiers were stopped in their car by a man dressed in
civilian clothes who informed them that they were in a restricted
zone.
   ``The tour tried to leave, but was blocked. Another individual
in civilian clothing punctured the vehicle's left front tire with a
bayonet,'' Williams said. ``Then a Soviet investigation officer
arrived and indicated to the U.S. tour officer that that was an
overreaction, the puncturing of the tire.''
   The spokesman said U.S. Army officials in Europe found the
Soviet officer who came to investigate ``cordial, professional and
thorough,'' and that the two American soldiers were found not to
have been in a restricted area.
   ``No U.S. personnel were threatened. They did not perceive a
threat to their safety,'' Williams said.
   The spokesman said no one was injured and the U.S. soldiers
returned to their base in the East Germany city of Potsdam near
Berlin.
   Williams said it appeared that the man who had slashed the tire
was a Soviet officer.
   He said the Americans were detained for such a long time because
the Soviet investigating officer had to come some distance and then
conducted a very thorough investigation.
   The observers are part of the U.S. military mission that was
established under a 1947 accord that allows the Western allies and
the Soviets to set up offices in each other's occupation zones.
Under this pact, the United States, Britain and France have
military liaison offices in East Germany, which is the old Soviet
occupation zone, and the Soviets have three in West Germany, one in
each of the old U.S, British and French zones. Each office may have
a staff of 14 soldiers.
   Asked what the two U.S. officers were doing at the time of the
incident Friday, Williams said, ``They were doing what U.S.
military liaison mission people do. They go out and they look
around. It's similar to what the Soviet military mission does,
based out of Frankfurt.''
   The detention came despite the signing in June of a U.S.-Soviet
agreement designed to avoid dangerous military incidents reached
between then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William
Crowe, and top Soviet military officials.
   On Monday, the Pentagon also announced that U.S. and Soviet
officials met in Washington in August and in Moscow in November to
prepare for implementation of the safety accord. The agreement is
scheduled formally to come into force Jan. 1.
   In March 1985, a Soviet sentry shot an unarmed U.S. Army major,
Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., and let him to die without medical aid,
saying Nicholson had been ``caught red-handed'' taking pictures in
a restricted area of East Germany.
