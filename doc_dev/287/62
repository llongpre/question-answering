   Military President Augusto Pinochet
changed half of his Cabinet and flatly ruled out an early departure
from power, rejecting a demand by the opposition parties that
defeated him in the Oct. 5 referendum.
   Speaking at a ceremony in which he swore in the new ministers
Friday, Pinochet also, for the first time, appeared to rule out his
candidacy in a competitive presidential election next year.
   ``I will hand over my post to the person that citizens elect
freely, secretly and in an informed fashion on Dec. 14, 1989,'' the
election date, the 72-year-old president and army commander said.
   Although most legal experts say the constitution bars him from
running in the election and succeeding himself, there has been open
speculation, including by high-ranking government officials, that
he might seek a legal loophole.
   The constitution calls for his term to end in March 1990, when
he will be succeeded by the winner of the December 1989 election.
   Pinochet brought in eight new ministers, all civilians, to his
16-man Cabinet, and shifted one to a different ministry. He kept
seven others, including some military officers.
   In the most most important change, he named Carlos Caceres, a
48-year-old U.S.-educated economist, to replace Sergio Fernandez as
interior minister, by far the most potentially politically powerful
post in the Cabinet.
   The opposition and even some pro-government politicians had
called for the removal of Fernandez, who had firmly rejected
opposition demands for negotiations on democratic reforms of the
8-year-old constitution drawn up under Pinochet.
   In his speech, Pinochet flatly rejected the opposition demands,
saying: ``Sirs, the constitution will not be modified. This issue
is not at stake.''
   The opposition claims its victory in the referendum, in which
Pinochet sought to extend his rule until 1997, showed that voters
want to speed up transition to democracy and the president's
departure from power.
   In the referendum, a simple yes or no ballot, 3.9 million people
voted against Pinochet's continued rule and 3.1 million voted in
favor. Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup that deposed the elected
government of Salvador Allende, a Marxist who died in the coup.
   Opposition leaders seemed unworried by Pinochet's firm rejection
of their demands.
   Jorge Burgos, assistant secretary-general of the Christian
Democratic Party, the country's largest, said of Pinochet's speech:
``Sometimes words can be changed by deeds.''
   Caceres did not rule out a dialogue with the opposition. ``Let
me analyze, think about and study this issue, and then we'll
talk,'' he told reporters.
   Should the government finally agree to negotiating with the
opposition, Caceres would the key man in the talks.
   Caceres, a technocrat who served briefly as finance minister in
the early 1980s, is widely considered more moderate than his
predecessor, Fernandez. He is also considered to be especially
close to Pinochet. He handled the finances of the president's
campaign in the referendum.
   In other important Cabinet changes, Pinochet brought his
ambassador to Washington, Hernan Felipe Errazuriz, 43, to replace
Ricardo Garcia as foreign minister. Miguel Angel Poduje was moved
from the housing ministry to replace Orlando Poblete as government
secretary-general, a key post roughly equivalent to a chief of
staff.
   Pinochet kept finance minister Hernan Buchi, 39, a Columbia
University-graduated engineer, who is widely credited with the
successful performance of the economy in recent years.
   Also confirmed in their posts were Patricio Carvajal, as defense
minister; army Gen. Manuel Concha, economy; Juan Antonio Guzman,
education; Hugo Rosende, justice; army Gen. Bruno Siebert, public
works; and Juan Giaconi, health.
   Other new ministers are Jaime de la Sota, agriculture; Armando
Alvarez, national property; Guillermo Arthur, labor; Pablo
Barahona, mining; Gustavo Montero, housing; Carlos Silva,
transportation.
