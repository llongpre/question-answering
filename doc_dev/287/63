   The Soviet Union on Monday proposed huge
reductions in troops and armor and recommended that the Warsaw Pact
and NATO negotiate to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from
Europe.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevarndadze's proposals went far
beyond the reductions NATO plans to suggest at conventional arms
talks that begin Thursday.
   A U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity,
said Shevardnadze's purpose in proposing the missile talks was ``to
see whether possible fissures in the alliance could be developed.''
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as one of the most positive
characteristics'' of Shevardnadze's speech, the official said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told 35 foreign ministers
gathered in a baroque palace that the West's goal, at least
initially, is to reduce the Warsaw Pact's current advantage in
conventional forces.
   Estimates vary but give the Soviet-led alliance at least a 2-1
advantage in tanks.
   ``The Warsaw Pact's conventional military preponderance,
especially in the spearheads of attack, is what makes an invasion
possible,'' Baker said.
   He urged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to implement the
``new thinking'' that guides economic and political reform in the
Soviet Union by renouncing the Brezhnev Doctrine ``beyond any shadow
of a doubt.''
   That doctrine permits military intervention in a Soviet bloc
country in the event of a liberal insurrection. The late President
Leonid I. Brezhnev introduced it after the Red Army crushed the
liberal ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Those in the East should be free of the fear that armed Soviet
intervention, justified by the Brezhnev Doctrine, would be used
again to deny them choice,'' Baker said.
   He also said Australia would organize a conference to prevent the
spread of chemical weapons and the Bush administration was exploring
ways to speed the removal of U.S. chemical weapons from West Germany.
   Baker added, however: ``Unilateral action is not enough. The
Soviet Union has enormous stocks of chemical weapons threatening
Europe. We therefore call on the Soviets to join us, to accelerate
the destruction of their enormous stockpile of these frightening
weapons.''
   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: ``I welcome this intention
to explore ways for the early removal of chemical weapons from the
Federal Republic.''
   Kohl's chief spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, said earlier Baker
telephoned the chancellor Saturday night and told him the aging U.S.
chemical weapons would be withdrawn by 1992.
   Shevardnadze countered a NATO proposal to retire at least 25,000
Warsaw Pact tanks, then reduce armor, artillery and personnel
carriers on both sides by 5-10 percent with a three-phase plan for
radical cuts.
   The foreign minister's arms reduction program went far beyond
NATO's by adding missiles, combat aircraft and soldiers.
   ``Let me ask what kind of reductions are these if they do not
affect the main component of armed forces _ their personnel?'' he
said. ``And surely airplanes and helicopters can be used for a
surprise attack.''
   In the Soviet second phase, 500,000 men on each side would be
demobilized.
   According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private U.S.
research group, the Warsaw Pact has 3.09 million soldiers and NATO
more than 2.13 million. NATO spends about $300 billion a year to
defend Western Europe, where 326,000 Americans are stationed.
   As Shevardnadze explained it, the Soviet plan's progression would
be:
   _ First phase, two to three years: Eliminate the imbalance in
troops and arms, cutting 10 percent to 15 percent from the current
lowest numbers.
   _ Second, also two to three years: Reduce forces by another 25
percent and withdraw battlefield nuclear weapons to a safe distance
from ``the line of contact'' between the military alliances. That
would make much of West Germany, along with East Germany and
Czechoslovakia a nuclear-free zone.
   _ Third: Convert remaining forces to ``a strictly defensive
character.''
   While the reductions are made, Shevardnadze said, negotiations
should be conducted on eliminating tactical nuclear weapons in
Europe.
   His proposal conflicts with the 40-year-old U.S. policy of
deterring the Soviets with with a mix of weaponry incuding
battlefield nuclear arms, which have a maximum range of 300 miles.
   Kohl wants to delay modernizing U.S. Lance missiles in West
Germany for up to three years, with the support of Norway and
officials of other West European governments. Baker is trying to
change the chancellor's mind.
   In December, Gorbachev announced a unilateral withdrawal of six
Soviet tank divisions and 50,000 men from Eastern Europe and said
Soviet forces in Europe and Asia would be reduced by 500,000.
   How Shevardnadze's three-phase reduction fits into that is not
clear. The foreign minister provided few details of an obviously
complicated proposition.
   Baker said in his speech the Warsaw Pact has 3-1 advantages in
tanks and artillery and more than 2-1 in armored troop carriers.
   He said Gorbachev's offer was ``a good start,'' but the Warsaw
Pact would retain a 2-1 edge in tanks and artillery even after the
Soviet leader's reductions.
