   Sixty-six senators of both parties called
Thursday for President Bush to make further changes in U.S. policy
toward Cambodia, including permitting development aid and direct
talks with the communist government in Phnom Penh.
   The senators, nearly two-thirds of the Senate, also challenged
administration assertions that there is no consistent military
coordination between the two non-communist factions fighting the
Cambodian government and the feared Khmer Rouge rebels with whom
they are allied.
   Those signing the letter, led by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., spanned the
political spectrum in the chamber. Their move reflected growing
congressional fears of a Khmer Rouge military victory,
inadvertently abetted by the United States.
   The group included 13 Republicans and 53 Democrats.
   On July 18, about a week after the original letter to Bush began
circulating in the Senate, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
announced that the United States was withdrawing its support for a
U.N. seat for the rebel coalition.
   Baker also said the United States would open a limited dialogue
with the government of Vietnam, which installed Hun Sen in power
before withdrawing its troops last year. And he said limited U.S.
humanitarian aid could begin flowing to Cambodia, which is the
subject of a 15-year-old U.S. embargo.
   In the letter sent to Bush on Wednesday, the senators welcomed
those moves, but said additional steps would be necessary to
demonstrate that keeping the Khmer Rouge from re-taking power is
the highest aim of U.S. policy.
   The Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of more than a
million Cambodians during their 3{-year rule in the late 1970s as
they sought to force their vision of a communist agrarian state on
the country. People executed or died of starvation and disease.
   The senators called for three additional steps:
   _ Pressing the government of China, which U.S. intelligence
estimates provides $100 million a year in military aid to the Khmer
Rouge, to end its support for the communist rebels.
   _ Opening direct contacts with the Hun Sen government in Phnom
Penh aimed at arranging free and fair elections supervised by the
United Nations.
   _ Permitting U.S. development aid to flow to Cambodia to
strengthen and redirect its beleaguered economy.
   In addition, the group called for closer scrutiny of the $7
million in overt non-lethal aid and the estimated $13 million in
covert military aid which the United States now sends each year to
the rebel coalition.
   The letter emphasized that U.S. law bars any aid which has ``the
effect of promoting, sustaining or augmenting, directly or
indirectly, the capacity of the Khmer Rouge... to conduct military
operations.''
   It did not call directly for an aid cutoff, but asked the
administration ``to thoroughly investigate'' reports of military
cooperation between the non-communist rebels and the Khmer Rouge
``to ensure that there is no tactical or strategic cooperation.''.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee voted June 28 to cut off the
covert aid program.
   The Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency,
in briefings for interested officials, have described how the three
allied rebel groups share supply lines which are controlled by the
Khmer Rouge, and coordinate their anti-government attacks.
   Deep inside Cambodia, the lines between the separate fighting
forces are blurred, the intelligence reports say, and the rebel
group of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, backed by the United States,
serves as a political front to bring respectability to the Khmer
Rouge.
   ``The Khmer Rouge are marching again, and from the reports I
have received they are marching together with the forces of Prince
Sihanouk,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said in a floor speech.
   The letter concluded: ``We believe that after 20 years of
turmoil and tragedy, the people of Cambodia deserve an opportunity
to determine their own future free of fear of the Khmer Rouge.''
