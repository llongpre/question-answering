<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "Is the Embargo </F>
Against Cuba About To End?"] 
  [Text] Havana -- Now that Washington has lifted the embargo 
on Vietnam, where the United States lost nearly 60,000 men 
during the war imposed on that Asian nation, many people have 
wondered whether the White House will terminate the more than 
30-year-old U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
  I believe the end of the embargo is neither in sight nor in 
the future, as the most pessimistic might think. 
  The rejection of this ineffective and hostile posture toward 
Cuba has increased considerably. Concurrently, this U.S. 
position meets the determined resistance of important forces 
both in and outside government circles. 
  Summing up the opinions of the increasingly large number of 
those who oppose the embargo, the Miami newspaper the NEW HERALD 
reported on 7 March: "From religious and humanitarian 
organizations to conservative editors and from civil rights 
groups to business managers the various groups that criticize 
the commercial embargo say it is a Cold War relic that harms 
U.S. business or contributes to poverty on the island." 
  To this must be added the beginning of the embargo debates 
in 
the House of Representatives. Apart from the final results, the 
internal pressure has reached a point where, in addition to many 
expressions of international repudiation, two UN resolutions 
have been issued on the issue. 
  To all this could be added the powerful movement the 
organization Pastors for Peace coordinates in the United States 
against the embargo. An increasing number of U.S. church people 
are participating in this crusade, which picks up followers in 
other countries and Europe as well. 
  The fact the most influential U.S. newspapers, including THE 
WALL STREET JOURNAL, have criticized the embargo as the best way 
to deal with Cuba is another very meaningful indication of the 
trend which will prevail gradually and "step by step" [previous 
three words in English] in the United States. 
  If, with the lifting of the blockade against Vietnam, the 
realism and levelheadedness of U.S. businessmen has managed to 
do away with the dogmatism and anachronism of a group of 
officials and legislators, I believe, concerning Cuba's, they 
would not be too far away from playing a significant role. 
  That is, of course, if they are not forced to arrive too 
late 
to an event where businessmen from the American and European 
continents, among other areas, are already operating legally in 
places open to them. 
  All which has been said up to here must still confront tough 
opponents, which include, among other elements, electoral 
interests which, in their attempt to win the 1996 elections in 
Florida, have tied the Cuban policy to the dictates of the 
extreme rightist sectors in Miami; a Congress that faces 
elections in November and is extremely cautious of its actions; 
and even an overloaded official agenda which has not made the 
Cuban issue a priority. 
  To this we have to add, as an ingredient we cannot possibly 
ignore, the complicated situation triggered by the so-called 
White Water scandal in the current Democratic administration. 
  In my opinion, boosted by the most rightist sector of the 
U.S. political and business scenario with which President 
William Clinton has had disagreements since last year, this 
process will tend to favor, at least for the time being, those 
in Washington who advocate a conservative government position.
