JAMES FLANIGAN: IT TOOK TIME, BUT U.S. STEEL LEARNED LESSON

In Pittsburg, Calif., last Thursday, the U.S. Steel division of USX Corp. and 
its partner, Pohang Steel Co. of South Korea, dedicated a parable for our 
times. 
</P>
<P>
With speeches hailing the globalization of industry from USX Chairman David M. 
Roderick and Pohang managing director Young-soo Han, the joint venture known as 
USS-Posco Industries launched a refitted steel mill equipped with the very 
latest in industrial technology. 
</P>
<P>
And there was evident pride among the 1,100 U.S. employees who would work the 
new machines. "There is nothing like this anywhere in the world," said Harold 
Dominguez, who helps oversee a complex of five giant roller machines that press 
steel into thin sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez had been sent to Quangdong, South Korea, to train on the equipment. 
His co-worker Bill Medeiros had been sent to Japan and South Korea. All told, 
150 Pittsburg employees were sent to West Germany, France, Japan and South 
Korea to train on up-to-date equipment -- which told them something about the 
good old U.S.A. "We saw how far behind was the American machinery we were 
working on," says Medeiros. 
</P>
<P>
How, you may ask, did we get to the point where American employees of U.S. 
Steel -- the firm organized by J. P. Morgan himself in 1901 -- had to be sent 
abroad for training so they could work a mill half-owned by a steel company set 
up only 20 years ago by the Korean government? 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburg plant's history can tell you the answer, as well as much else 
about industrial competitiveness -- how things were done in the past and how, 
happily, they'll be done differently in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hurt by Imports 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburg was an old U.S. Steel facility that supplied the fruit and vegetable 
canners, office equipment makers and construction industries of growing 
California -- some of its steel built the Oakland Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1970s, it began to lose out to Japanese steel imports. Soon 
Pittsburg could only make the bottoms and backs of Steelcase desk drawers, 
explains E. A. Roskovensky, who runs the plant today. The mill couldn't supply 
visible parts of a desk because its equipment couldn't produce 
consistent-quality steel, and Steelcase didn't want customers thinking their 
desks were warped. By 1984, when imports had taken 52% of the market, the 
choice of close down or fight back had to be made. Roderick, to his credit, 
opted for battle, signing up Pohang as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies have invested $430 million to outfit the mill with the latest 
in steel-making equipment from Mannesmann of West Germany, Hitachi of Japan and 
others. The plant's computer-controllers are American, from General Electric 
and Honeywell, but the steel equipment is from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because such equipment is no longer made in the United States, the result 
of two decades when other countries kept building or modernizing steel plants, 
but nothing was built here. "In steel, the state of the art is advanced by 
building a new plant and we didn't have the money to build a new plant," says 
U.S. Steel President Thomas Graham. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fell Further Behind 
</P>
<P>
Other countries built steel mills to industrialize their economies, as in South 
Korea, or to provide employment for their citizens, as in Europe. And all 
nations counted on the U.S. market to absorb the resulting surplus, Graham 
explains. U.S. industry didn't make such uneconomic investments, he says, and 
therefore spared American taxpayers the burden of subsidized steel plants that 
foreign taxpayers are now complaining about. 
</P>
<P>
But a price was paid, nonetheless. The U.S. industry refrained from unwise 
expansion, to be sure. But it also neglected modernization of its old plants, 
relying instead on wringing production from outdated equipment and arguing for 
cutbacks in labor costs to become competitive. But such efforts were no match 
for the cost savings and quality improvements achieved by new equipment -- so 
the Americans fell further behind their foreign rivals. 
</P>
<P>
It was a curiously selective investment policy: In years when investment 
bankers and "junk bond" geniuses made millions of dollars from deal-making, 
there was no money to improve productive equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Sins of omission have consequences. The pride and education levels of America's 
work force suffered. If industry keeps working with outdated equipment, there 
is less need for the math and verbal skills that modern computerized machinery 
demands. And grunt labor turning out poor quality steel doesn't command the 
higher pay that goes with productive equipment, either. 
</P>
<P>
Something else has been lost, as well. An industrial base has disappeared, as 
equipment suppliers to heavy industry have gone out of business because there 
were no orders. 
</P>
<P>
Which is untimely because U.S. demand for steel equipment is now rising. 
Capacity has been cut to the point where American steel is profitable and 
imports -- affected by currency shifts -- are losing out. The Pittsburg plant, 
now the low-cost steel supplier in California, will demonstrate that there's a 
payoff to investments in making better steel more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Improvements 
</P>
<P>
And other steelmakers will follow up in years to come, says Chairman Roderick 
of USX. "The American steel industry will pour its profits into plant 
improvements," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Great news, but the curious prospect today is that progress will mean more 
orders for Mannesmann and Hitachi, and more study abroad for U.S. workers -- 
with the whole process, predictably, being hailed as a wondrous example of the 
globalization of industry. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the glass is half full, not half empty: Steel mills and jobs are 
being upgraded, and the pride of the American work force is being restored. But 
somehow there's a nagging question of whether quite so many Americans had to 
suffer before U.S. industry learned some simple lessons.
