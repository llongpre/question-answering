   Sales of North American-made cars and light
trucks by the nation's Big Three automakers plunged 26.1 percent in
late August compared with last year, the automakers said.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
Wednesday they sold an average of 32,046 cars and trucks a day
during the Aug. 21-31 period, compared with a rate of 43,390 daily
during the same time last year. Car sales were down 27 percent and
truck sales were off 24.8 percent.
   Officials for the automakers attributed the decline more to a
weak economy than higher gasoline prices stemming from Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.

   Oil shortages from the embargo against Iraq
and Kuwait may develop late this year, Bush administration
officials said.
   Assistant Energy Secretary John J. Easton Jr. told the House
Government Operations Committee on Wednesday that `we see the
potential for greater uncertainty as winter develops.''
   Despite record high inventories and commitments by OPEC
producers to make up much of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti production, both
government and private analysts said they expect a world shortage
to develop by late November or early December.

York and Moscow or Leningrad.

   Regional dairy groups feuded as the Bush
administration began looking into whether the decades-old U.S. milk
pricing system should be changed.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department on Wednesday returned to the
city where dairy prices are determined as it opened the first of
several hearings into recommendations to change the federal milk
market order system.
   The complicated formula partially pays farmers based on how far
they live from Eau Claire, a city of about 50,000 located 120 miles
east of Minneapolis in the heart of Wisconsin's dairy land.
