   President Roh Tae-woo carried out a
broad cabinet shakeup Monday to sweep away the tainted legacy of
former President Chun Doo-hwan, who went into retreat after
apologizing for abuses during his regime.
   Roh named as his new premier Kang Young-hoon, a U.S.-educated
lawmaker in the governing party. Kang replaces Lee Hyun-jae.
   The president promised last month to remove the vestiges of the
Chun Cabinet to help sooth public anger over Chun's authoritarian
rule.
   Chun stepped down as president last February. On Nov. 23, he went
into self-imposed internal exile after publicly apologizing for
corruption and repression during his seven-year rule. He has denied
personal wrongdoing, however.
   Roh replaced all but three posts in the 23-member Cabinet.
   Kang, 66, a lawmaker of the governing Democratic Justice Party,
was forced to retire as superintendent of the Korean Military
Academy in 1961 when he opposed Park Chung-hee, who ousted the
civilian government in a military coup.
   He later went to the United States and earned a doctorate in
political science at Southern California University. He served as
ambassador to Britain and the Holy See in the early 1980s.
   Cho Soon, a 60-year-old U.S.-educated economist, was made deputy
prime minister and also economic plannmg minister to replace Rha
Woong-bae.
   The president also named ambassador to Saudi Arabia, 58-year-old
Choi Ho-joong, as the new foreign minister. He succeeds Choi
Kwang-soo.
   Retired Gen. Lee Sang-hoon became defense minister. He was vice
commander of the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces in 1985 before retiring.
