   The Reagan administration's refusal to turn
over classified documents for the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North
jeopardizes the prosecution's central charges against the former
national security aide.
   President Reagan insists that the documents are being withheld
for national security reasons, and says the decision is not a ploy
to prevent North from going to trial.
   ``The things we're blocking are the things that duty requires we
block,'' Reagan said Thursday. ``These are things that are national
security secrets.''
   Asked if the move were a backdoor maneuver to keep the case
against North from going to trial, he replied: ``No, this is
something that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do.''

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The record buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
has stirred dreams of big stock profits and hopes that the company's
corporate headquarters would return to this tobacco city, but it
also brought fears of layoffs.
   ``I think the general feeling is one of uncertainty,'' Fred
Nordenholz, president of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce, said
Thursday. ``There are lots of mixed feelings about what's
happening.''
   The food and tobacco giant was auctioned off to buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. late Wednesday in a $24.53 billion
deal valued at about $109 a share in cash and securities.
   That is virtually double the stock's price before management
started a bidding war six weeks ago and represents a big windfall
for this city. Analysts estimate that about 9,000 people in the area
plus local trusts, foundations and retirement plans own stock now
worth a little more than $2 billion.

   Thousands of people jammed city
streets, dancing, beating drums and chanting ``Long live Benazir!''
after Benazir Bhutto was named prime minister, becoming the first
woman to lead a Moslem nation.
   Ms. Bhutto was scheduled to take the oath today, ushering in a
new era of national democracy.
   Ms. Bhutto, a 35-year-old U.S.-educated woman who married and
gave birth to her first child this year, emerged as the country's
leader Thursday when President Ghulam Ishaq Khan chose her as prime
minister.
   The president also declared an end to a state of emergency
imposed after former leader Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq's death in
August. He said he took the action ``so the new prime minister can
take up her responsibility in an environment of complete democracy.''

   West Germans today mark the 50th anniversary of the
discovery of nuclear fission, the technological breakthrough that
led to the atomic bomb and nuclear energy.
   The prestigious Max-Planck Institute, along with four other
scientific research organizations, planned a formal ceremony
honoring the fateful discovery in West Berlin's Congress Hall.
   Those addressing the several hundred invited guests included West
Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen and Heinz A. Staab, president of the
Max-Planck Institute.
   The ceremony was scheduled two weeks before the actual 50th
anniversary of the key experiment, which began Dec. 16, 1938.

   The FBI says a sting operation that began in
a small suburban Buffalo storefront knocked out a massive American
and Sicilian Mafia drug operation that was selling millions of
dollars worth of heroin in the United States and cocaine in Italy.
   Some of the heroin was shipped as liquefied heroin in wine
bottles from Italy, officials said.
   Although the international food trading company set up by agents
three years ago never handled any drug shipments, it allowed the FBI
to establish contacts with organized crime operations in the United
States and Italy, G. Robert Langford, special agent in charge of the
FBI's Buffalo office, said Thursday.
   As a result of the investigation, which broadened to include FBI
offices nationwide, the FBI and Italian authorities have charged
more than 200 people in a multimillion-dollar heroin importation and
cocaine distribution operation involving Sicilian Mafia figures and
the Gambino crime family in New York.

   Woody Guthrie's songs rang out in a packed
theater at a long-delayed tribute to the composer of ``This Land Is
Your Land'' in his hometown, where some still maintain the
folk-singing great was no folk hero.
   About 50 schoolchildren and adult accompanists Thursday sang and
played fiddle, guitar, banjo, harmonica and piano in Okemah's
450-seat Crystal Theater as the audience whistled and clapped along.
   ``I sat there with chill bumps and with tears,'' said Guthrie's
65-year-old sister, Mary Jo Edgmon, who represented the Guthrie
family. His singer son, Arlo, did not attend the tribute just a few
blocks from the overgrown lot where the Guthrie family's house once
stood.
   Shows honoring the ``Dust Bowl Balladeer,'' who died in 1967,
have been held in such grand auditoriums as Carnegie Hall. But
Thursday's was the first in Okemah because people like city
councilman Bart Webb think Guthrie was more of a subversive than a
star.
