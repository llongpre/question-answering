   Rep. Gus Savage survived a sexual harassment
scandal and a strong challenge to win the Democrat primary, but his
opponent said the five-term congressman's strength may be ebbing.
   With 95 percent of precincts reporting in the mostly black
district, Savage had 39,602 votes or 51 percent and Mel Reynolds,
who like Savage is black, had 33,472 votes or 43 percent. A
follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche had 5 percent.
   ``Here's a 10-year incumbent barely getting over 50 percent of
the vote against someone who's never held elective office,'' said
Reynolds, 38, a former Rhodes scholar whom detractors labeled an
outsider backed mostly by whites.
   ``There's no doubt about it,'' Savage's political strength is
weakening, said Reynolds, who received just 14 percent of the vote
when he ran against Savage in 1988.
   Other victors in Tuesday's election included Secretary of State
Jim Edgar, whose campaign for the GOP gubernatorial nomination over
an abortion foe drew support from the White House. He faces
Attorney General Neil Hartigan, who was unopposed in the Democratic
primary. Four-term Republican Gov. James R. Thompson is retiring.
   Attorney Richard Phelan, who led the U.S. House ethics committee
probe that forced out Speaker Jim Wright last year, won his first
try at political office in a tough four-way Democratic race for
Cook County Board president.
   And age was the dominant issue as 80-year-old U.S. Rep. Sidney
Yates won renomination to a 21st term by defeating a 32-year-old
Chicago alderman in the Democratic primary.
   In special elections in New York City, Democratic Assemblyman
Jose Serrano easily defeated his opponent to become the first
Puerto Rican native serving as a full voting member of Congress,
and Republican Susan Molinari won handily to claim the
congressional seat her father gave up to become Staten Island
borough president.
   In Chicago, Nathaniel Clay, editor of Metro Press, a
black-oriented weekly newspaper, said Savage has been hurt by a
finding by the House ethics committee that the congressman had made
improper sexual advances to a Peace Corps worker during a trip last
year to Zaire.
   But Clay noted that Savage, 64, has never gotten much over 50
percent of the vote, ``but that's what's amazing, he keeps getting
elected, just barely.''
   Clay said Savage's support comes mostly from poor blacks in the
district, which covers the city's South Side and some suburbs.
   ``He plays on their emotions. Many of those people feel locked
out, left behind,'' and Savage wins them over with campaigns based
on bigotry, hate and attacks on what he calls ``white racists,''
Clay said.
   In his victory speech Tuesday night, Savage said his win is
indicative of the power of the people.
   ``Our opponent was those whites who control all of the people's
television airwaves'' and major newspapers, Savage said.
   Political analyst Don Rose, a frequent ally of Savage, says it
will take someone who can match Savage's credentials as a longtime
black activist to beat him. ``He was one of two or three major
players who created the black independent political movement in
Chicago,'' Rose said.
   Savage is considered a shoo-in in November over GOP candidate
William Hespel, a state worker who defeated two candidates.
   In New York, Serrano, 46, will fill the vacancy left by Robert
Garcia, a Democrat who quit his South Bronx seat after his
conviction in the Wedtech influence-peddling scandal. Serrano
pulled in 93 percent of the vote.
   Molinari, 31, a City Council member, will become the youngest
member of Congress when sworn in. She won with 59 percent of the
vote. Her father is Guy Molinari, who had held the seat since 1980
and was co-chairman of President Bush's campaign in New York in
1988.
