<LEADPARA>  The Bush administration, in the first move toward normalizing relations with
the nations of Indochina, announced Thursday that it is preparing to lift the
16-year-old U.S. trade embargo against Cambodia. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Solomon told a House subcommittee that the embargo will be lifted and
other positive steps taken as soon as the international accord on Cambodia is
signed in Paris next Wednesday and U.N. implementation of the agreement has
begun. Within 10 days after the signing, according to U.N. plans, the first
elements of a U.N. mission are to be dispatched to supervise a cease-fire
among four warring groups and oversee eventual elections in Cambodia.  </LEADPARA>
