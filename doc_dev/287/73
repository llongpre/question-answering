<HEAD>Reagan Praises American Troops in Berlin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>

   Former President Ronald Reagan today said
U.S. troops in Berlin played an important role in the movements to
democracy in Eastern Europe.
   Reagan spoke to about 1,000 American military people and
dependents at Tempelhof Airport before flying to Poland, the second
stop on his 10-day trip that also includes a visit to the Soviet
Union.
   ``Nowhere have the events been more dramatic than here in
Berlin,'' Reagan said to the largely military audience on the
airport tarmac, in front of two old planes that flew food to West
Berlin during the Soviet blockade more than four decades ago.
   ``What you are doing here played an important role in the events
of Nov. 9,'' Reagan said, referring to the day the Berlin Wall was
opened last year.
   As a souvenir, U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters gave the former
president one of the Berlin sector division signs that said in four
languages, ``You are leaving the American sector.''
   Reagan said the 7-by-10-foot sign would become part of his
presidential library in Simi Valley, Calif.
   While in Berlin, Reagan used a hammer and chisel on the Berlin
Wall, taking symbolic whacks at the old Cold War barrier, and also
visited Bonn, the West German capital, where he met Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and President Richard von Weizsaecker.
