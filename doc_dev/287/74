   An Energy Department study said that a mothballed, unfinished Washington (state) Public Power Supply System nuclear reactor could be converted to produce weapons-grade tritium. 

   The study, prepared at the request of Rep. Sid Morrison (R., Wash.), didn't recommend the conversion. 
But Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said, "I think they're setting the stage for turning a civilian reactor into a bomb factory." 

   Administration officials say a new tritium plant will be needed in the 1990s. 
The report said the cost of converting the Washington state plant, which is 63% built, by 1993 would be $2.1 billion to $3.5 billion. 
However, the report doesn't address acquisition costs or whether the plant would be purchased or leased. 
An agency official estimated the cost of building such a plant from scratch at $2 billion to $5 billion. 

   Lawmakers from the region are split over whether the plant should be converted. 
While Rep. Morrison favors it, Rep. Wyden contends it would reverse a 30-year-old U.S. policy of keeping defense and civilian nuclear facilities separate. 
He also said it would conflict with U.S. opposition to the use of nuclear power plants to produce weapons-grade material in other countries. 

   Aides to Sen. Dan Evans (R., Wash.) warned that any transfer of the plant could trigger a requirement that almost $2 billion worth of bonds tied to the plant be paid off.
