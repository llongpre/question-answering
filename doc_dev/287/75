   The Bush administration, anticipating that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega will try to rig national elections in
Panama, is considering additional punitive measures against the
military leader after Sunday's balloting, according to U.S.
officials.
   The officials said the options range from an effort to seize
Noriega's assets abroad to enlisting the support of friendly
democratic countries in a campaign to increase Panama's
international isolation.
   ``There is no possibility of no response,'' said one official,
alluding to the alleged efforts by the Panamanian government to use
fraudulent means to defeat the opposition slate in the elections.
   According to the official, there have been discussions within
the government about the possibility of taking legal action to
seize Noriega's assets in the United States and Europe.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said there are no
reliable figures on the amount of these assets but they are
believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Noriega was indicted last year by two Florida grand juries on
drug smuggling charges.
   For more than a week, there has been a steady drumbeat of
administration allegations that Noriega has been laying the
groundwork for a rigged process aimed at ensuring victory for his
handpicked presidential candidate, Carlos Duque.
   On Friday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
expressed suspicion about a huge increase in the
officially-announced numbers of registered voters over the past
five years, suggesting that the figures were falsified.
   Panamanian authorities, meanwhile, have been accusing the United
States of meddling in the election, seizing on published reports
that the administration secretly provided $10 million to the
opposition coalition.
   The Reagan administration imposed a series of sanctions against
Panama last year after Noriega and his allies ousted President Eric
Arturo Delvalle. Among other actions, $50 million in Panamanian
government assets in the United States were frozen.
   The United States continues to recognize Delvalle as the
legitimate authority in Panama and has said there can be no
normalization of relations with any Panamanian government dominated
by Noriega.
   The officials cautioned that no concrete decisions have been
made on future punitive action if, as expected, a fraudulent
election is held.
   Over the medium term, one decision that will be forced on the
administration concerns the appointment for the first time of a
Panamanian as administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, which
is responsible for running the waterway.
   The canal treaties specify that Panama later this year will
nominate a candidate to head the commission, subject to U.S.
approval and Senate confirmation.
   The nominee would take office next year but would be subject to
policy guidelines issued by the canal's board of directors, where
U.S. members are in the majority.
   The official said his personal view is that the administration
will not accept a Noriega-nominated candidate but the final
decision on that issue has not yet been made.
   If the U.S. refuses to allow a Panamanian to lead the
commission, this could leave the administration open to charges of
violating the canal treaties. For the time being, however, the
administration position is that it has every intention of abiding
by the terms of the treaty.
   Noriega, a 52-year-old U.S.-trained military man, has gone from
a favorite of U.S. anti-drug and intelligence agencies to an
outcast whom the U.S. now accuses of corruption, drug trafficking
and internal repression.
   Noriega was intelligence chief under the late dictator Omar
Torrijos and as such collaborated with U.S. agencies for years.
Like Torrijos, he has maintained contacts with Latin governments
and military leaders not too friendly to the United States.
   His backers maintain the United States would have been better
advised to work with Noriega in exploiting those ties than trying
to oust him.
   ``The U.S. government has acted in a very stupid manner,'' Maj.
Edgardo Lopez, a spokesman for Noriega, said recently in Panama
City. ``The drug charge against Noriega is a cover. The U.S. does
not care about drugs. If it did it would fight consumption at home.
They want Noriega out because he opposed an invasion of Nicaragua
and the training of Contras in Panama and because he opposes plans
by the United States to keep its forces here beyond the year 2000.''
   Besides freezing Panamanian government funds in the United
States, the Bush administration has withheld Panama Canal fees of
more than $90 million and has refused to pay Panamanian taxes the
Canal Commission withholds from its Panamanian employees' salaries.
   Even so, U.S. expenditures in Panama total more than $500
million a year, largely from the 12,000 U.S. soldiers at military
installations of the Southern Command. That gives the United States
considerably more leverage for increased economic pressure if it so
desires.
