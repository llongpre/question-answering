   When President Bush agonizes over a difficult
choice, as he's done this week on the issue of economic sanctions
against the Soviet Union, he sometimes likes to quote a favorite
philosopher, Yogi Berra.
   ``I love the old expression of Yogi Berra's _ you say, `what
happened to the Mets, Yogi?' He said, `Well, we made the wrong
mistakes,''' the president told a group of building contractors on
Tuesday.
   Bush used the words of the often verbally befuddled baseball
great to explain his decision _ at least for the moment _ not to
slap a series of economic penalties on the Soviet Union in response
to its crackdown in Lithuania.
   ``I expect in this job I'll make plenty of mistakes, but I don't
want to make the wrong mistakes,'' Bush said.
   Once again, the issue of sanctions was presenting a major
foreign policy dilemma for Bush.
   Just as he resisted imposing sanctions on China last year in the
aftermath of the bloody Tiananmen Square massacre, the president
once again finds himself under pressure from conservatives in
Congress to act more decisively.
   It was, to use another favorite Bush Berra-ism, ``deja vu _ all
over again.''
   Last summer, Bush finally imposed a series of non-economic
sanctions on the Beijing government, while saying he did not want
to go further for fear of hurting the Chinese people.
   Among those sanctions was a ban on high-level contacts between
governments. However, the president then sent national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft on a secret mission to express U.S.
feelings about the use of force against China's own citizens.
   When confronted with the apparent violation of his own
no-contact edict, Bush said he did not want to take any steps that
would isolate China from the community of nations.
   He now is making similar arguments for withholding sanctions
against the Soviet Union that would show U.S. displeasure with the
Kremlin's efforts to block Lithuanian independence.
   Administration sources said Bush marched to the brink of
announcing sanctions on Moscow _ only to back away, at least for
the moment, in response to skepticism from U.S. allies in Western
Europe over such a course and concern that U.S. sanctions could
only make matters worse.
   Explaining his reluctance, Bush said: ``You've got to look at
the real options. I'm old enough to remember Hungary in 1956 and
where we exhorted people to go to the barricades, and a lot of
people were left out there all alone.''
   The president used the same argument recently for explaining why
his administration would not formally recognize the new government
of Lithuania.
   The only sanctions Bush said he would consider are economic ones
_ and sources say these would deal mainly with withholding trade
and investment concessions that the United States was otherwise
prepared to grant Moscow.
   Economic links between the two superpowers right now are slight.
And Bush has repeatedly ruled out this government's main economic
leverage over the Soviet Union: a grain embargo.
   The Bush administration, and the Reagan administration before
it, has argued that the trouble with economic sanctions is that
they rarely work the way they are intended _ and often wind up
hurting the wrong people.
   Bush voiced such an argument over past sanctions against the
white minority rule government of South Africa. Economic penalties
now in place were imposed by Congress over Reagan-Bush
administration objections.
   More recently, the president _ yielding to congressional
pressure _ voiced support for keeping the sanctions in place
against Pretoria, even though he disputes their value.
   He has said they should remain on at least until more progress
is made toward a one-person, one-vote government.
   Ironically, in Central America, where U.S. sanctions have taken
a major toll on national economies, Bush is having a hard time
winning congressional support for undoing the impact of those
sanctions.
   Vice President Dan Quayle heads today for the inauguration of
Nicaraguan President-elect Violeta Chamorro without the aid Bush
promised her U.S.-backed government and the new government of
Panama.
   Years of U.S. economic sanctions against the leftist government
of outgoing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and the Panama
dictatorship of Manuel Antonio Noriega left both countries'
economies hobbled.
   The president's $800 million aid package for the two nations
remains stalled in Congress.
   Bush invoked the Yogi Berra ``wrong mistakes'' quote twice on
Tuesday. After he told it to a group of agricultural writers, he
added: ``You've got to think about that one. And I don't want to
make the wrong mistake.''
