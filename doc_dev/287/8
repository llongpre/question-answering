   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos discussed
the solar system with fourth graders at a suburban Roman Catholic
school Wednesday, hours before the president challenged American
students to excel in math and science.
   ``Who can name the planets in the solar system?'' Cavazos asked
the nearly two dozen youngsters at St. Camillus, an elementary
school in Silver Spring, Md.
   ``We learned a sentence to help us know them,'' 9-year-old John
Oduroe informed him. ``It goes, `My Very Energetic Mother Just
Served Us Nine Pancakes.'''
   The boy then began to tick off the names of the planets as other
classmates joined in _ Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto _ showing they could be among the
nation's better students.
   The visit by Cavazos, a former teacher who had served as
president of Texas Tech University before joining the Reagan
administration, underscored a message of President Bush in his
State of the Union address _ American students must be first in the
world by the year 2000 in science and math.
   Cavazos and other education officials have repeatedly that
studies show:
   _Just 40 percent of American 13-year-old students could solve a
two-step problem in math, compared with 72 percent of the South
Korean students.
   _Only 42 percent of 13-year-old U.S. students could successfully
analyze experiments, compared with 72 percent of the South Korean
students.
   _Singapore ranks first in 12th grade biology, while America is
dead last among 13 countries.
   _Fewer than 1 percent of U.S. students take physics and
chemistry, while up to 25 percent of 18-year-olds in Canada and
Norway take the two subjects for two years each.
   _Japan and Korea tie for first in general science for
10-year-olds, while America ranks eighth.
   However, officials of the National Catholic Educational
Association are quick to show that Catholic math students score 3.6
percent to 5.46 percent better than public school students and
Catholic school science scores are higher that public schools by
4.39 percent in the third grade, 6.36 percent in the seventh grade
and 3.76 percent in the 11th grade.
   ``The solution of American problems will not be solved by one
educational system alone, but every system working together,''
Cavazos told an audience that included the 278 St. Camillus
students, some of their parents and Catholic education officials.
   The selection of St. Camillus served a variety of purposes
during celebration of ``National Appreciation Day for Catholic
Schools.'' Besides having high-achieving youngsters, Principal
Suzette Chagnon estimates her students come from families
originating in at least 25 countries.
   The Bush administration has been bombarded with suggested ways
to improve academic achievement, especially among members of
minority groups, since President Bush called the nation's governors
to an education ``summit conference'' last year. The ideas are to
be distilled into national goals by late February.
   American students attend school about 180 days per year, while
Europeans typically attend 220 days, the Japanese 240 days and
South Koreans 250 days per year, Senate Democratic leader George
Mitchell has pointed out.
   Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, says that in Germany, radio and
television programs on math and science supplement school work. In
South Korea, 71 percent of the 13-year-old students watch science
programs compared with only 37 percent in America.
   ``At about that age, many American students fail to keep an
active interest in science,'' said Thomson. ``Schools need to work
harder to make science attractive, but other institutions in
society must support this effort.''
   Thomson added that in a 1987 survey of 3,000 high school
sophomores who were asked whether, ``my parents think science is a
very important subject,'' 57 percent said ``no.''
