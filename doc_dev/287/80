   Three U.S. mine sweepers and a support
vessel steamed out of the Persian Gulf on Saturday in the biggest
pullout of American warships from the region since the Iran-Iraq
cease-fire 7{ months ago.
   The tank landing ship USS Peoria sailed through the Strait of
Hormuz as escort for the mine sweepers Fearless, Inflict and
Illusive, bound for U.S. East Coast ports.
   Their departure left 10 Navy ships in the gulf, including three
mine sweepers. With a nine-ship carrier battle group in the north
Arabian Sea, the U.S. fleet was reduced to fewer than 20 ships for
the first time since the massive Western naval buildup of mid-1987.
   A Navy official said the withdrawal of the three mine sweepers
was decided after ``consultations with our friends in the gulf''
and ``is consistent with the reduced threat to shipping'' since the
Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   The truce ended eight years of hostilities that had spread to
the oil-rich gulf. The fighting damaged or sank about 540
commercial ships and killed 300 sailors.
   The United States sharply expanded its force in the gulf to
protect U.S.-flag shipping and to escort 11 Kuwait-owned oil
tankers that were re-registered under the Stars and Stripes.
Kuwait's shipping was being targeted by Iranian gunboats because of
its support for Iraq.
   Five Western European governments also sent extra warships and
at one time the foreign navies in the region had a combined
strength of nearly 80 ships. The others have largely withdrawn
since the cease-fire.
   U.S. military sources said that apart from the three remaining
U.S. mine sweepers, whose future is uncertain, the latest
withdrawal may be the last by the United States.
   Navy sources said the 8,450-ton Peoria will escort the three
departing ``sweeps'' back to the East Coast and return to its port
in San Diego.
   The Fearless and Illusive are based in Charleston, S.C., and the
Inflict in Little Creek, Va.
   The 720-ton, wooden-hulled mine sweepers were built just after
the Korean war in the early 1950s and are the oldest U.S. Navy
ships on active duty.
   Derided by critics as too old and outmoded, the U.S. mine
sweepers outstripped the more modern European mine sweepers in
disposing of mines laid by Iran in the gulf.
   The sources said the three departing vessels were credited with
about half of more than 50 mines found and destroyed by the U.S.
anti-mine ships since they arrived in November, 1987.
   U.S. officers have said that despite the cease-fire, a threat
from undiscovered mines laid by both Iran and Iraq will persist in
the gulf, especially in its northern waters.
   Four previous cutbacks of the U.S. force since the cease-fire
had involved only one warship at a time.
   The United States also has approved the ``deflagging'' of six of
the 11 Kuwaiti tankers, but the process has been stalled for over a
month, reportedly over legal details.
