   The Soviet Union, shuffling the top level of
its foreign service, is expected to send a new ambassador to
Washington in time for the June summit meeting betweem President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, administration
officials said Wednesday.
   Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh would replace Yuri V. Dubinin, who has
headed the Soviet Embassy here since 1986.
   Dubinin is slated to become the new Soviet ambassador to France,
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bessmertnykh, an urbane, experienced and well-traveled
56-year-old expert on the United States, Canada and the Middle
East, is the first deputy foreign minister.
   Dubinin, 59, who came to Washington fluent in Spanish and
French, swiftly developed facility in English and oversaw the
opening of the Embassy to news conferences and other sessions with
diplomats and reporters under the glasnost, or openness, policy of
Gorbachev.
   The wavy-haired, smiling envoy was a self-described
``popularizer of perestroika,'' the Gorbachev program for
restructuring the Soviet economy. But he could also take on
assignments with a hard edge.
   As the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Dubinin in 1986
blasted the Reagan administration's slashing of the Soviet staff
there from 275 to 170 as ``large-scale political sabotage.''
   Bessmertnykh, an arms control specialist and a graduate of the
Moscow State Institute of International Relations, is considered
particularly close to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, who began three days of talks Wednesday with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A specific date for the Bush-Gorbachev summit, to be held in
Washington, is expected to be decided upon during Shevardnadze's
visit.
   Bessmertnykh, who confers regularly in Moscow with U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr., accompanied Shevardnadze to
Washington for the talks, which will culminate Friday with a
meeting with Bush at the White House.
   His prospective reassignment as the Soviet ambassador to
Washington is part of a revamping of the principal overseas
assignments in the Soviet foreign service. It is not considered a
reflection on Dubinin, who succeeded longtime Soviet ambassador
Anatoly F. Dobrynin. Both envoys were known for their affability.
   Dubinin, who entered the Soviet foreign service in 1965,
evidently was not accorded the special status by the Reagan and
Bush administrations that Dobrynin enjoyed in the Nixon years.
   Dobrynin was used by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, also
the national security adviser, during the detente era of the 1970s
as a special channel to the Kremlin.
   Bessmertnykh, who served here from 1970 to 1983, is responsible
in the foreign ministry for Canada and the Middle East as well as
for U.S. affairs. He was named chief of the foreign ministry's
U.S.A. department in 1983 and was elevated to the post of first
deputy foreign minister in October 1988.
