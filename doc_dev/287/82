  [Text] Hanoi, June 3 KYODO -- Vietnamese Communist Party 
chief Do Muoi says Hanoi wants to have fully normalized ties 
with the United States as early as possible but without any 
linkage to human rights. 
  "As for when our relations with the United States can be 
normalized, that is up to the American side," Muoi said in an 
interview Thursday [2 June] night with KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
President Yasuhiko Inukai. "The sooner the better." 
  Muoi, 77, noted that a U.S. Government delegation is 
expected 
to visit Hanoi shortly, though he did not suggest the level at 
which it would be led. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord reportedly 
plans a visit around the end of this month, which may be 
followed in late July by a visit by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. 
  Muoi said that while Vietnam stands prepared to discuss 
human 
rights and various other issues with the U.S., it cannot accept 
any linkage between human rights issues and overall bilateral 
relations. 
  His remarks follow President Bill Clinton's decision to 
extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status despite 
domestic pressures to use trade as a leverage to force human 
rights concessions. 
  Vietnam, which is reorienting its economy toward exports, is 
reportedly one of only nine countries not accorded the 
low-tariff status by Washington. 
  On Feb. 3, Clinton lifted the 19-year-old U.S. embargo 
against Vietnam. 
  Last month, Vietnamese and U.S. diplomats exchanged 
diplomatic notes on the opening of liaison offices in each 
other's capitals as a step toward full diplomatic ties. 
  Turning to Vietnam's simmering row with China over 
potentially oil-rich areas of the South China Sea, Muoi called 
on Beijing to spell out more clearly its proposal for shelving 
the disputes and participating in joint development. 
  He said that though the idea of joint development may merit 
consideration, the issue of sovereignty must be resolved first. 
  Muoi called for a conference among all parties laying claim 
to the contested areas of the South China Sea, which include 
Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. 
  He said Vietnam prefers that the matter be settled through 
peaceful dialogue. 
  Beijing and Hanoi are disputing ownership of the Spratly and 
Paracel Islands and their adjacent areas, having skirmished at 
sea over the sovereignty issue as recently as 1988. 
  Each country's awarding of oil exploration concessions to 
foreign companies has raised the level of tension in recent 
months. 
  Muoi suggested that China is violating Vietnamese 
sovereignty 
by drilling in an area which he said is "clearly part of 
Vietnam's Continental Shelf." 
  Earlier this week, a U.S. energy company contracted by 
Beijing began a physical seismic survey in an area only 350 
kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh City. 
  Muoi also made a case for increasing in Japanese investment 
in Vietnam, noting that investors could produce at low cost by 
taking advantage of Vietnam's cheap labor. 
  He lamented that the level of Japanese direct investment 
remains relatively small and noted that more of it goes to China 
than to Vietnam. 
  With some 496 million dollars so far invested in 53 
projects, 
Japan trails in sixth place behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Australia and Singapore as an investor in Vietnam. 
  Muoi said Vietnam holds high expectations of Japan as a 
source of capital and technology needed to develop the country's 
increasingly market-oriented economy. 
  He said he looks forward to an opportunity to visit Japan. 
  Muoi was named party general secretary in June 1991 after 
having served as prime minister for three years. 
  The son of a farming family outside Hanoi, he became a party 
member in 1939 at age 22. 
  He was jailed in the early 1940s by the French for 
participating in the movement against colonial rule. 
  Elected a member of the party's decision-making Central 
Committee in 1960, he was appointed vice premier in 1969 and 
became a full member of the ruling Politburo in 1982. 
  In July 1988, while serving as vice chairman of the Council 
of Ministers in charge of capital construction, industry and 
material supply, he was elected by the National Assembly to 
succeed the late Prime Minister Pham Hung.
