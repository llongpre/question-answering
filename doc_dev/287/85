   Police said they fired on a crowd of about 200
Palestinian protesters Tuesday near Shuafat refugee camp on the
northern outskirts of Jerusalem, killing one teen-ager and wounding
two.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said the demonstrators blocked the
main road near the shantytown of about 8,000 Palestinians and began
hurling stones at passing vehicles.
   ``They then assaulted an outpost manned by three policemen who
fired tear gas, rubber bullets and finally live ammunition to drive
them back,'' he said.
   Doctors at Jerusalem's Mokassed Hospital said 16-year-old Mumzer
Zuhdi Musa Adabed was brought in dead with a gunshot wound in his
chest _ the 724th Palestinian killed by Israeli security forces or
civilians since the 31-month-long revolt began. Forty-four Israelis
have also been killed.
   In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian identified as Salim
Salah Khuly, 24, was found stabbed and beaten to death near
Tulkarum. Residents said the victim was suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities.
   The army confirmed the death but blamed the slaying on internal
strife between rival Palestinian clans.
   Since the revolt began in December 1987, at least 233
Palestinians, including Khuly, were killed by fellow Arabs, most as
suspected collaborators, drug dealers or prostitutes.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   _The attorney general ordered police to press charges against
Israeli peace activist Abie Nathan for allegedly meeting with
leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization in violation of
Israeli law, Israel television said.
   _Doctors advised Foreign Minister David Levy to delay his
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Paris
next week pending an improvement in his health. Levy, 52, underwent
surgery following a mild heart attack last month.
   Baker has sought for months to arrange Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, but his efforts have been deadlocked by Israel's
insistence on excluding the PLO from talks. Israel views the PLO as
a terrorist group.
   _Police announced the arrest of Israelis Eli Vanunu, 33, and Nir
Ephroni, 27, for the 1984 murder of Omar Ahamad Uda, an Arab gas
station attendant. They said the killing apparently was to avenge
the death of an Israeli female soldier, believed killed by
Palestinian nationalists.
   An informed Israeli source meanwhile said Israel supplied
intelligence information to Washington indicating that an elite
military unit within the PLO was behind the May 28 bombing at a
Jerusalem vegetable market that killed one Israeli and wounded nine.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh declined comment and
officials in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office said they knew
of no such information.
   The bombing came two days prior to a failed speedboat attack on
Israeli beaches by a splinter PLO faction.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat refused to condemn that raid, leading
to suspension of the 18-month-old U.S.-PLO dialogue, launched after
Arafat renounced terrorism.
   The Israeli source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
bombing was the action of Force 17, a military unit set up by
Arafat. The source said this information was passed on to the
United States and likely played a role in President Bush's decision
to cut off the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
