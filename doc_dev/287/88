   A man was beaten and taken away by Cuban
police Tuesday as he tried to enter what serves as a U.S.
diplomatic office in Havana, a State Department spokesman said on
Tuesday night.
   The unknown man entered the grounds of the U.S. interests
section of the Swiss Embassy shortly after 8 a.m., said the
spokesman, David Denny.
   ``While he was on interests section grounds but before he could
enter the building, he was seized, beaten and taken away by Cuban
police who entered U.S. diplomatic property,'' said Denny.
   U.S. diplomats protested the action to the Cuban Foreign
Ministry, he said.
   The United States and Cuba have had no formal diplomatic
relations since 1960. Each has designated another country to be its
formal representative in the other's capital, Switzerland in Havana
and Czechoslovakia in Washington.
   In practice, U.S. diplomats work out of the old U.S. embassy in
Havana under the name of the U.S. interests section of the Swiss
Embassy.
   Cubans seeking asylum have invaded the Spanish, Italian and
Czech embassies in Havana in recent days. Denny said he did not
know whether the appearance of the man at the U.S. interests
section was connected with those other asylum-seekers.
