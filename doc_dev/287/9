   Secretary of State James Baker III is close to
making his decision on the fate of the bug-riddled U.S. Embassy
building in Moscow, with one key option being to construct an annex
for top-secret business, officials say.
   But some members of Congress might balk at that idea as ``empire
building,'' said Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a congressional
expert on the embassy debacle.
   ``It would look like we're rewarding the State Department for
exorbitant mistakes in the past,'' she said. ``They have to justify
the need'' for a new building, she said.
   Officials at the State Department said Baker's decision on the
multimillion-dollar fiasco could come this week.
   ``Baker is nearly ready to make a decision. The intelligence
community has signed onto a plan,'' said one department official,
speaking on condition he remain anonymous.
   But he said Baker has not approved the proposal, which would
then be sent to President Bush before it is transmitted to Congress.
   Baker's dilemma, which he inherited from the Reagan
administration, is what should be done with the bug-infested,
red-brick building that has never been used by American diplomats.
   Listening devices and eavesdropping equipment were discovered in
the building in 1985, 13 years after the United States and the
Soviet Union signed a construction agreement that allowed Soviet
builders to do the job.
   Over the past four years, State Department officials have
floated a number of possible options for the building, known in
Washington circles as the NOB, or New Office Building.
   They include razing the building and replacing it with a secure
facility; ripping out only the top floors to make them bug-free, or
constructing a new annex as a place for secret talks and
transmissions.
   In April, two key department officials, Ambassador Nicholas
Salgo and Ivan Selin, undersecretary for management, told Baker
that constructing an annex would be cheaper than the estimated $500
million that might be needed to tear down the NOB and replace it.
   The annex idea follows a recommendation by James Schlesinger,
the former defense secretary, who prepared a report on the embassy
for the Reagan administration. He also suggested making the top
three floors of the existing building secure.
   A month before Bush was elected, former President Reagan
advocated razing the building, saying the United States had ``no
choice'' but to do so.
   But congressional sources, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, say the annex solution now appears high on the
department's agenda.
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, chairman of the House panel that
appropriates money for the State Department, said one possibility
being discussed is for the United States to buy the so-called
``change'' building _ the place Russian workers changed clothes _
that is situated between the old U.S. Embassy building and the new
building.
   The change building would be torn down and replaced with a
secure annex. The bugged building could then be used for other
purposes, perhaps a cultural center, a visa office or an office for
visiting American business executives.
   The department has not asked for additional money for the
embassy building in the 1990 fiscal year.
   If Baker endorses building an annex, members of Congress will
have some tough questions for the department, Snowe said. For one,
they will want to know what the department intends to do with the
extra space.
   ``What do we do with the existing building, what do we do with
the building they are in now?'' she asked.
   Another difficulty is the U.S.-Soviet reciprocity agreement that
would give the Soviets the right to demand additional space in
Washington, she said. The United States barred the Soviets from
occupying their new embassy in Washington after the Moscow problems
were uncovered.
   Other congressional sources said there are sure to be questions
about how to protect those who worked in the annex. Those dealing
with sensitive material would be easily identifiable, they said.
   Regardless of Baker's decisions, officials said it would take
several more years before the situation is resolved.
