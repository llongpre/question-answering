<LEADPARA>  As bugles blared "Retreat" and a farewell honor guard stood at attention, the
U.S. flag was slowly lowered for the last time here Tuesday as the United
States formally turned over its oldest and once largest overseas base to the
Philippines.;   Clark's closing, 89 years after it was established as a U.S.
base, leaves about 5,500 troops at the sprawling naval base and air station at
Subic Bay, which services the 7th Fleet. Talks are under way in Manila to
close that facility in 1994, a result of the Philippine Senate's dramatic
rejection in September of a proposed 10-year lease.  </LEADPARA>

89-YEAR-OLD U.S. BASE IN PHILIPPINES CLOSES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The final 245 Americans at Clark -- all who remained of nearly 20,000
airmen, civilian employees and dependents evacuated before the devastating
eruption of neighboring Mount Pinatubo last June -- were to fly out of the
Philippines by mid-afternoon. Their departure ends a historic role for a base
long considered key to U.S. military operations.;   Within an hour of
Tuesday's ceremony, dozens of looters were reported climbing over fences and
ripping out major electric cables. Other military-issued items, from boxes of
MRE field rations to kitchen sinks, already are on sale in black-market
shops.;   Clark was ordered closed after it suffered massive damage in the
Pinatubo eruption.;   Clark played a historic role almost since its founding
in 1902 as a U.S. cavalry garrison. It quickly grew to 156,204 acres. Japanese
planes bombed it hours after they hit Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and used
its five runways throughout the war. It was home base for kamikaze pilots
flying suicide missions against American ships.;   Later, Clark served as a
transshipment hub during the Korean War, and was a major command and logistics
center during the Vietnam War.  </TEXT>
