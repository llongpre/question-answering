   Mikhail Gorbachev wants assurances from President
Bush this weekend that the United States will not exploit the
Eastern European reform movement, say government officials who add
the Soviet leader hopes for improved trade ties from the superpower
summit.
   Gorbachev also will be seeking progress on an array of arms
control issues as he and Bush hold their first summit Saturday and
Sunday on U.S. and Soviet warships in the waters off Malta.
   ``To put it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environment
for our domestic work,'' says Gorbachev, whose economic
restructuring program of perestroika has yet to produce measurable
improvements in the daily life of Soviet citizens.
   The 58-year-old Soviet leader will be attending his sixth summit
with an American president, and in circumstances that scarcely
seemed imaginable a few weeks ago _ much less when he first sat
down with President Reagan in Geneva.
   Gorbachev has encouraged and endorsed the political changes that
have brought reformers to power in every Eastern bloc nation except
Romania. But in the days leading up to the summit, he has spoken
openly of fears that the West may try to exploit the situation.
   ``The most dangerous thing at such moments is that someone may
become tempted to use them for their own selfish interests,'' he
said recently.
   Bush seemed to reply in a speech on Nov. 22 in which he said,
``We will seek President Gorbachev's assurance that this process of
reform in Eastern Europe will continue. And we will give him our
word that America welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking
advantage, but as a people offering support.''
   There seems little doubt that Gorbachev will underscore his
commitment to reform.
   ``Moscow observers say in jest that Gorbachev will possibly
carry to Bush on board the cruiser Belknap a fragment of the ruined
Iron Curtain,'' the official Novisti Press Agency quipped.
   Gorbachev says the Kremlin will no longer impose its views on
its allies and may seek a pledge that Washington will not, for
example, try the sort of end-run the Soviets staged by aiding Fidel
Castro's Cuba. To bar potential unrest, the Soviets may even
endorse massive U.S. assistance; Poland, for example, is seeking $1
billion in Western cash.
   Bush's Thanksgiving eve invitation to Gorbachev to end decades
of East-West confrontation was seized on by the Soviets as proof
the superpowers are on the threshold of a ``new stage of broad and
open cooperation,'' in the words of Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   The Soviets are writing a law allowing virtually unrestricted
emigration of Jews and others that Bush wants before recommending
that the Soviets be granted ``most-favored nation status,'' to ease
access of their goods to U.S. markets.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze flushed with anger when
asked whether the summit was called so the Kremlin could seek U.S.
aid for its shortage-plagued economy. ``It offends our national
pride,'' he said.
   But pride or not, the Soviets want U.S. know-how, computers and
management techniques.
   Shevardnadze says the Soviets want ``mutually beneficial
economic and trade cooperation.'' However, even if Bush agrees to
loosen controls on high-tech exports and upgrade the Soviets'
trading status, it's uncertain how much their state-run enterprises
could benefit.
   As of now, they can offer U.S. customers only ``petroleum and
vodka and caviar and not much else,'' says Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
   Arms control _ the centerpiece of past summits _ is now
overshadowed by the momentous changes in Eastern Europe. For
Soviets, however, weapons cuts would be tangible proof that
Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' is paying off.
   The Soviet ideal, says Viktor A. Kremenyuk, would be a timetable
fixing goals for the Geneva talks on strategic weapons cuts and the
Vienna negotiations on conventional arms in Europe. Kremenyuk is
the deputy chief of a Kremlin think tank studying the United States.
   At the last round of Geneva talks, ``the two sides' approaches
were so far apart that no convergence was discernible,'' Novisti
charged in frustration. The Soviets cleared the way for progress by
dropping their condition that Washington agree not to deploy the
Strategic Defense Initiative, and now are hinting Malta could break
remaining logjams.
   Kremenyuk said the Soviets want the 30 percent to 50 percent
cuts in superpower arsenals envisaged by the proposed Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty, plus a cooling-off of regional conflicts
like Afghanistan, so they can shift more resources to the civilian
economy.
