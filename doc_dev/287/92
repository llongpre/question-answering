   A refusenik family that became the focus
of a superpower tug-of-war left the Soviet Union on Wednesday and
celebrated the end of an 11-year struggle to emigrate with a night
at the opera.
   Wearing radiant smiles, Yuri and Tanya Zieman and their
12-year-old daughter, Vera, stepped off an Aeroflot jet to a warm
welcome from Western friends, U.S. Embassy officials and members of
an organization helping emigre Soviet Jews.
   Asked how she felt on arriving in the West, Mrs. Zieman said
simply, ``Stunned.'' Her daughter, clutching a bouquet from
well-wishers, giggled, ``Excited.''
   The family will stay in Vienna until Friday, when they fly to
Boston for a reunion with an older daughter who emigrated in 1987
with her husband.
   A woman answering the telephone at their Vienna hotel said the
Ziemans went to the Palais Schwarzenberg, one of the city's finest
restaurants, for dinner. A waiter at the restaurant said the dinner
was only a prelude to a true Viennese delight: a performance of
Mozart's ``The Magic Flute'' at the opera.
   It was a rather more stylish celebration of the Ziemans'
departure than an impromptu champagne toast with several dozen
friends and relatives gathered at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport
Wednesday.
   ``I'm glad you're all here,'' Zieman told the group. ``I invite
you all to my new home.'' Zieman is a former computer specialist
who has help odd jobs since applying to emigrate, and was seriously
ill earlier in the year.
   In Vienna, he said he now feels ``much better. I'm so excited
that it sometimes seems to me that all my sicknesses are behind
me.''
   In Moscow, Mrs. Zieman called her departure ``one of the most
difficult moments of one's life. It's like your own funeral in a
way because most of the people who are here today I won't see again
_ my old teachers, relatives, friends.''
   The family spent a sleepless night clearing customs in Moscow
and saying farewell to friends, she said.
   U.S. diplomats said President Reagan had planned to visit the
Zieman family at their Moscow apartment during the summit meeting
in May and June to underscore U.S. concern for human rights in the
Soviet Union.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, became interested in the Ziemans'
plight after receiving a letter from Vera, who apparently caught
their sympathy with her plea to help a ``lifelong refusenik'' _ a
reference to the refusal by Soviet authorities to let her leave the
country almost since she was born.
   A high-ranking Soviet official told U.S. officials, however,
that if the president visited the family, the Ziemans would never
be allowed to emigrate.
   Reagan did not visit them, and two weeks after he left they were
told their application had been refused again and that they should
reapply in 1992. Within weeks, however, they received permission to
leave.
   Soviet officials previously had rejected their applications for
emigration, saying the Ziemans had access to state secrets.
   The Zieman family was among the most prominent of those
remaining in the Soviet Union in the year since officials began
granting permission for the best-known refuseniks to emigrate.
