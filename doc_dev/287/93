<F P=106> [Editorial: "End of embargo; Expanded relations"] </F>
  [Text] The decision by U.S. President Bill Clinton to end 
the decades- old U.S. trade embargo against its former enemy 
Vietnam has been widely welcomed here by leaders from both 
public and private sectors. 
  Many locally owned factories in Vietnam which were set up in 
the Southeast Asian country under the assumption the embargo 
would soon be lifted will surely turn a handsome profit as a 
result of the U.S. policy change. 
  To date, investments by Taiwan-based enterprises in Vietnam 
are estimated to be worth more than US$1.5 billion, making the 
island that nation's number one source of foreign capital. 
  Most local companies went to Vietnam because of the 
availability of cheap labor there. Vietnam also shares much in 
common with Taiwan, due to its cultural heritage, work ethic and 
the customs of its people. This commonality has surely helped 
to attract investment from Taiwan. 
  Over the past few years, labor-intensive manufacturers of 
various products ranging from textiles to low-end electronics 
have been unable to maintain their price competitiveness 
vis-a-vis other competitors in Southeast Asia and mainland 
China, due to rising costs on the island. 
  Seeing that these industries had to move somewhere, 
authorities here rightly encouraged them to set up production 
lines in Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, in order to 
avoid risking too many of the country's financial and industrial 
resources in mainland China, which has been the top choice for 
outbound investment for many years. 
  Now that the U.S. embargo has been lifted, the Vietnamese 
economy is expected to be given a great boost and the country 
will certainly become more important in the international arena. 
  However, the ROC [Republic of China] government should be 
careful not to assess the current situation in Vietnam by 
looking through recolored glasses. 
  In the late 1970s when relations between the United States 
and mainland China were normalized, many people got caught up in 
the euphoria that went along with the new friendly relations 
between the two countries and forgot that the mainland remained 
a communist state. 
  After tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled over the 
dead bodies of students and workers who dared to speak out 
against the Beijing regime in 1989, many people in the outside 
world were surprised to learn that communist China had retained 
a Leninist system of suppression after the death of Mao Tse-tung. 
  Now that Vietnam and the United States have apparently 
bridged some of their differences, people in Taiwan should 
refrain from adopting a similarly naive attitude about the 
leadership in Hanoi. 
  Formally known as the "Socialist Republic of Vietnam," our 
southwesterly neighbor is one of the world's last remaining 
communist dictatorships, and the leadership of the Vietnamese 
Communist Party is doing all it can to keep it that way. 
  To be sure, sweeping economic reforms were made by 
Vietnamese 
leaders beginning in 1986 with the so-called "doi moi" or 
"renovation" policies. But virtually no major political reforms 
have been made, except for efforts aimed at transferring more 
day-to-day administrative duties from party committees to 
official state organs apparently in order to avoid wasteful 
duplication and the transferring of certain administrative 
responsibilities to local governments in order to increase the 
efficiency of the state bureaucracy. 
  The Vietnamese Communist Party has retained its leading role 
in all important spheres of life in Vietnam. Any attempt to 
organize any kind of opposition force is still, as always, 
ruthlessly persecuted in Vietnam today. 
  The Vietnamese communists also continue to restrict 
religious 
activity throughout the country. 
  After the government of the Republic of Vietnam fell on 
April 
30, 1975, and the south was brought under the control of 
northern-led forces, Chinese-Vietnamese citizens who had 
previously belonged to the pro-Taiwan camp or who held 
identification papers issued by the Republic of China were 
persecuted by the communists and in many cases their properties 
and businesses were confiscated. 
  After Vietnam invaded Cambodia and Hanoi's former allies in 
communist China staged a fierce attack on northern Vietnam in 
the late 1970s, many ethnic Chinese living in the country even 
those who had been pro-Beijing were forced to flee the country 
for their lives. 
  While we can't allow bad memories to unnecessarily restrict 
our contacts and trade with Vietnam, we should not forget the 
harsh treatment that people of Chinese ancestry have received at 
the hands of the Vietnamese communists. 
  Although the end of the U.S. embargo will certainly mean 
even 
more contacts, exchanges and investments in Vietnam, we should 
not allow ourselves to get carried away and make a mockery of 
our democratic ideals by hopping in bed with the Vietnamese 
communists. 
  As the old saying goes: "Those who lie down with dogs get up 
with fleas."
