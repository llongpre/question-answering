<LEADPARA>  The operators of the nation's oldest nuclear-power plant shut it down
indefinitely Tuesday, hours after federal regulators urged that it be taken
out of service immediately because of doubts about its safety.;   There was no
accident at the Yankee Atomic Electric Co. plant in Rowe, Mass., and no
immediate danger to residents of the sparsely populated Berkshire hills of
northwestern Massachusetts.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Nuclear Regulatory Commission experts said they were concerned that in
the unlikely event of an accident, the huge steel drum that surrounds the
reactor core -- weakened by 31 years of radiation bombardment -- might
rupture, leading to a release of radiation and a possible meltdown.;  
Officially, the plant's operators, a consortium of New England utilities,
acted voluntarily. But their hand was forced by the NRC, which was scheduled
to meet today to approve its technical staff's recommendation that the plant
be shut down. The plant cannot be restarted without NRC approval, the
commission said.;   NRC Chairman Ivan Selin said the owners "have acted very
responsibly. We will continue to work with utility in assessing this very
important matter.";   The nuclear plant, known as Yankee Rowe, is unique in
several ways. It is the oldest and smallest U.S. commercial reactor, with an
output of 185 megawatts, about one-fourth the size of most plants. It is also
the only one built entirely above ground. The reactor, its steel pressure
vessel and its cooling water systems are contained inside a sphere elevated on
steel supports.;   But despite the plant's uniqueness, the decision is
important to the entire U.S. nuclear industry because Yankee Rowe's operating
license expires in 2000, and it was expected to be the first plant to test the
possibility of extending its operating life.;   All U.S. nuclear plants are
licensed for 40 years. With no new plants being built or even planned, the
industry could begin to atrophy as the licenses expire unless the operators
can convince the NRC that it is safe to extend them. The phenomenon of
"embrittlement," or possible weakening of the pressurized steel vessel around
the reactor core, is expected to be a key factor in deciding whether plants
can continue to operate.;   The issue at Yankee Rowe is whether a sudden
temperature drop caused by the injection of thousands of gallons of cooling
water in an accident would cause the embrittled vessel to crack, much as a hot
glass would shatter when suddenly filled with cold water under pressure.  </TEXT>
