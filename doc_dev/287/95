   Soviet officials told Western diplomats Tuesday
that exit visas will be granted to a Jewish family President Reagan
considered visiting during the Moscow summit.
   Reagan had cancelled the visit for fear of dooming the family's
chance to emigrate.
   The informal notice passed by Soviet Foreign Ministry officials
to diplomats in Moscow, Washington and Canberra, Australia,
signaled an about-face in the case of Yuri and Tanya Zieman. A week
ago the Ziemans were officially informed their appeal for
permission to leave the country had been rejected.
   Mrs. Zieman said Tuesday she had heard the reports from
Australian and other diplomats, but she had no indication from
Soviet authorities that her family's 11-year quest for exit visas
was at an end.
   An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the U.S. government had been informed ``at the level
of a senior officer'' that the Zieman case was about to be
resolved. He refused to be more specific.
   The Ziemans' 12-year-old daughter, Vera, who calls herself ``a
lifelong refusenik,'' had appealed to the president and Mrs. Reagan
for help in gaining visas. The Reagans considered visiting her at
the family's three-room apartment in southwest Moscow during their
trip to Moscow three weeks ago.
   But Soviet officials sent word they would regard it as a direct
insult to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev if the Reagans visited
him in the Kremlin and then stopped by the Zieman home. One said
the Reagans would be ``behaving as if they had two hosts'' for the
official visit.
   U.S. sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Bessmertnykh had told U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock that if the Reagans visited the Ziemans
the family would never be permitted to leave the country.
   The president called off the visit but the Ziemans did attend a
tea the Reagans gave for people the U.S. administration considers
victims of Soviet human rights abuses. Vera, a pianist, recently
received a gift from the Reagans of music tapes.
   Yuri Zieman, a computer specialist who lost his job when he
applied to emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until stricken
several months ago by a brain ailment that has left him with double
vision and a loss of balance.
   The condition, diagnosed by some Soviet physicians as a
potentially deadly enlargement of an artery, made the family's
quest more urgent because Zieman was advised by his doctors not to
undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the Soviet Union.
   Zieman has been told he was not permitted to leave the country
for security reasons, although he contends he never had access to
state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet
security.
   The Ziemans have an older daughter who was permitted to emigrate
last year with her husband. They now live in the Boston area.
