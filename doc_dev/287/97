   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo arrived
Sunday for an unprecedented meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev designed to promote normalized relations and trade.
   Roh met Sunday evening with former President Reagan, who, with
his wife, Nancy, is scheduled to have breakfast Monday with the
Soviet president and his wife, Raisa.
   Reagan and Roh met for 20 minutes, during which they discussed
improving Seoul's relations with Moscow and easing tensions in the
region.
   ``This meeting will be an important step towards bringing peace
to Northeast Asia and on the Korean Peninsula, thereby ending the
Cold War in that part of the world,'' Reagan said of Roh's planned
session with Gorbachev.
   Some 200 people, both supporters and opponents of the visit,
staged a noisy demonstration outside the Fairmont Hotel after Roh
was safely inside. ``They're noisy, but nothing violent,'' said a
police dispatcher who would not give her name.
   Roh's plane, flying U.S. and Korean flags from a hatch above the
flight deck, was greeted by several hundred people, including San
Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, former Secretary of State George Shultz
and Korean Ambassador Hyun Hong-choo.
   Under a brilliant blue sky, Roh was handed a bouquet of flowers
by 8-year-old Diane Lieu, a San Francisco youngster clad in a Korean
costume of red and gold.
   ``I'm delighted to see this taking place,'' Shultz said just
before the plane landed. ``From the standpoint of the United States,
we have a great interest in peace and stability throughout the
Asian-Pacific region.''
   The city declared Sunday ``Roh Tae-woo Day,'' and Agnos was
expected to present Roh with the key to the city.
   The meeting between Roh and the Soviet president would be the
first time leaders of their countries have met since the Republic of
Korea was created 45 years ago. Korean officials expect them to meet
at about 4 p.m. Monday, when there is a 90-minute gap in Gorbachev's
crowded 22-hour San Francisco schedule.
   ``The waves of reform now reshaping the world have started
rushing toward Northeast Asia,'' Roh said as left Seoul. He said he
hoped talks with Gorbachev would help ``pave the way for the peace
and unification of the Korean peninsula.''
   ``Korea now remains the only country on earth that is still
divided as a legacy of the Cold War,'' Roh said.
   He is expected to invite Gorbachev to visit Seoul and may seek
Moscow's help in arranging a summit meeting with North Korean
President Kim Il-sung. Kim has refused to recognize the South Korean
government, and the Soviet Union is North Korea's oldest ally.
   During his talks with Gorbachev, Roh said he would focus on
bilateral issues, emphasizing the normalization of relations and
measures to promote peace and unification of the divided Korean
peninsula.
   Roh plans to leave Tuesday for Washington to meet with President
Bush.
   Local Koreans see the meeting as a step toward the reunification
of North and South Korea, an apparent goal of Roh and possibly
Gorbachev. Both of the leaders see increased economic opportunities
in such a move.
   Bilateral trade between the nations reached $600 million last
year, up 106 percent from 1988 and a tenfold hike over 1985 levels,
according to the Korean Embassy. The figure is expected to top $1
billion this year.
