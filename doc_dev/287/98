   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
foreign trade surged to a record $160.7 billion in 1987 as America
fell deeper into debt to the rest of the world, the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday.
   The deficit in the U.S. current account was 13.7 percent higher
than the 1986 deficit of $141.4 billion and marked the fifth
consecutive year that this trade deficit has hit a new record.
   The Reagan administration has sought to downplay the
significance of the trade deficits, but private economists contend
that the rapid buildup of foreign debt could eventually topple the
country into another recession, triggered by a plunge in the value
of the dollar.
   ``The increasing indebtedness of the United States is the most
insidious and potentially damaging long-run problem the country
must deal with,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co.
   The current account is the broadest gauge of America's dealings
with other countries because it measures not only the flow of
merchandise across U.S. borders but also the flow of services,
primarily investment earnings.
   For 16 of the past 17 years, the country has run deficits in the
merchandise trade category. But the current account was in surplus
as recently as 1981 because Americans' earnings on overseas
investments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits.
   But in this decade Americans have handed over billions of
dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods, transforming
the country from the world's largest creditor to the world's
largest debtor nation.
   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investments than
Americans hold in foreign investments. America was last a net
debtor in 1914. It regained that status in 1985 with a foreign debt
of $111.9 billion. That debt grew to $263.6 billion at the end of
1986.
   Based on Tuesday's current account statistics, Jeff Faux,
president of the Economic Policy Institute, estimated that the U.S.
foreign debt now totaled $424.2 billion, more than four times the
burden of the previous debt leader, Brazil.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and other administration
officials have argued that the country's debt status was not a
cause for alarm because the debt was still a tiny fraction of the
total U.S. economy.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before
Congress on Tuesday, said the fact that more and more U.S. assets
are being acquired by Japanese and other investors was a plus for
the U.S. economy, providing American jobs.
   But private economists argue that the increase in foreign
investment means that more American assets will be flowing into
foreign hands in the years ahead to service the growing debt,
lowering American standards of living and leaving the country
increasingly vulnerable to the whims of foreign investors.
   ``The most profound and enduring legacy of the Reagan period is
its conversion of the United States from the largest creditor
country in the world to the largest debtor,'' said C. Fred
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
``As long as the United States has to rely on foreign financing of
such magnitudes, events could at literally any moment trigger a
sharp turndown in our economy.''
   Bergsten said that America endured two such turbulent episodes
in early 1987 and again in the fall when weakened foreign
confidence sent the value of the dollar plunging and U.S. interest
rates up sharply. The last such event has been blamed as a
contributing factor in the record collapse of stock pricesd which
occurred on Oct. 19.
   The new report on the current account showed that the trade
deficit actually narrowed somewhat in the final three months of the
year, dropping to $39 billion, compared to record quarterly deficit
of $43.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting higher American
earnings abroad because of the decline in the value of the dollar.
   But this improvement did little to shrink the deficit for the
year, an imbalance reflecting a continued worsening in merchandise
trade and a shrinking of the investment surplus.
   The merchandise trade deficit, on a current accounts basis,
totaled $159.2 billion last year. Adding to that deficit were U.S.
foreign aid and other government transfer payments totaling $13.5
billion.
   The deficit was lowered slightly by a surplus of $12 billion in
the service category. While foreigners now own more in U.S.
investments, the payments still show a slight surplus in America's
favor because many of the older U.S. investments are earning a
higher rate of return.
   Economists said the $12 billion surplus in 1987, down from $18.6
billion in 1986, will shrink even more in 1988 and by 1989 will
drop into a deficit, further complicating the country's efforts to
reduce its trade imbalance.
   Bergsten estimated that total U.S. debt held by foreigners would
rise to around $700 billion to $800 billion by 1995, requiring net
interest payments of around $25 billion annually.
