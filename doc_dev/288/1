   Ralph Berthene looked forward to socializing
this weekend with 100 people from around the country who see things
the way he does _ from about 6 feet 5 inches up.
   ``It was a great experience to not have to stoop when you're
talking to somebody,'' the 32-year-old St. Paul man said of the
first time he went to a Twin Cities Tall Club event.
   The Minneapolis-St. Paul chapter is holding its annual weekend
get-together for members of the 50-year-old Tall Clubs
International, including a costume party, pig roast, dinner and
sightseeing tours.
   No basketball games were planned, says Chris Hager, president of
the Twin Cities' chapter, who just meets the women's height
requirement at 5-10. Men must be at least 6-2 to join.
   Members don't concentrate on activities celebrating their
tallness, but they do joke about it, and print the jokes on
T-shirts they sell, said Hager, 45, a heating company controller in
nearby Spring Park.
   ``One says `I may be the first to get rained on, but I'll be the
last to drown.' There's another one that says `No, I don't play
basketball. Do you play miniature golf?' The one I really like is
`Reach down and touch someone,''' said Hager.
   Berthene added quickly: ``We really don't have anything against
short people.''
   One chapter even has an annual baseball game with members of a
short people's club, Hager said.
   The tallest member in the clubs' history was the late Don
Koehler, an 8-foot-2 member from the Chicago area, said the clubs'
mere 5-foot-7 historian, Doris Chickering. The Highland, Md., woman
is an honorary member, ``married to a guy who is 6-2.''
   The 92-member Twin Cities chapter was founded 47 years ago and
serves Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota.
   Having fun with other tall people was the main reason the
organization's founder, 6-foot-2 Kae Sumner Einfeldt, 72, of Santa
Cruz, Calif., started the Tip Toppers Club of Los Angeles.
   The retired free-lance commercial design artist, who worked on
``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' held the first meeting in
1938. She said she was inspired to start the ``world's highest
society'' by her work on Walt Disney's film.
   ``I like to tell people I got so sick and tired of looking at
dwarfs,'' she said. ``They used to call me the giant girl who
painted dwarfs for Disney.''
   Tall Clubs International claims 5,000 members and prospective
members in 50 clubs in this country and Canada. The 60 European
clubs have about 7,500 members.
   The clubs remain social organizations, but have begun working to
make life easier for a population that is growing taller, says the
past president of the international chapter, 6-foot-7 Carl Bouler,
52, of Phoenix, Ariz.
   Clothing and retail executives were invited to the clubs'
national convention last year to hear members' desires for better
selection among tall fashions, Bouler said.
   The clubs once urged an automaker to install telescoping
steering, and the company came out later with tilt steering wheels.
``I think we gave them the idea, although they never admitted it,''
Einfeldt said.
   Otherwise, gaining acceptance for attributes besides their
height has been a major accomplishment.
   ``It is very common when any number of us walk into a restaurant
or any other place that people turn and look at us because we are
tall. Tall people seem to be considered to have a lot of authority
by other people,'' Hager said.
   ``I don't think it's bad (but) I don't think a lot of us realize
we are treated as we are. ... We don't understand the authority we
are being given.''
