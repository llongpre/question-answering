<TEXT>
THIS is one of the tallest of the hardy herbaceous campanulas, up to 5ft in
height and with big branching heads of light violet-blue, bell-shaped
flowers. It is a fine plant for the middle or back of a border in any
ordinary good soil and open or lightly-shaded place. Increase
is by division in spring or by seed. Seedlings may vary in character. There
is a dwarf variety, only 18 inches high, named Pouffe, and a tall lilac-pink
variety, Lodden Anna. The best blue variety is Prichard's Variety and there
is also a white, Alba.
