   Call it the case of the mystery press conference.
   A group of Democratic senators and congressmen scheduled a 1:30
p.m. press conference Tuesday to talk about the independent
prosecutor's report on Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The event
was listed on the Democratic convention's daily calendar.
   Came 1:30, a handful of reporters was there. But not the
senators or congressmen. A party spokesman said the event had been
moved to a nearby hotel where Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., was to
attend an unrelated session on fighting drugs. The two events had
been merged, the spokesman said.
   But Larry Carpman, Kerry's spokesman, said his boss was not
involved. Try the office of Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a long-time
critic of Meese's behavior in government?
   Levin's people said they had nothing to do with the event.
   ``This thing's not going to happen,'' said a party spokesman. He
was right.

   Speaking of Events that Never Were:
   People with AIDS Coalition, a newly formed AIDS prevention group
in Utah, had obtained a permit for a 90-minute program in the
``protest zone,'' an empty parking lot about a block from the
convention hall.
   Again, reporters showed up, but none of the advocates. No one
there knew why.
   ``We've had several groups that didn't show up,'' said Lt. W.F.
Derrick of the Atlanta police department.

   Scaling the Heights:
   He has the votes to be the Democratic nominee for president, but
does Michael Dukakis have the stature to fill the office?
   Sure. Dukakis, at 5-foot-8, is not another Lincoln (6-foot-4)
but he's as tall or taller than nine U.S. presidents including the
Adamses, John and John Quincy, both 5-foot-7.
   That hasn't prevented the occasional jibe, one of which was
repeated on air Monday by ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings. He
quoted an unidentified senior aide to Dukakis: ``We want a
convention that is organized, orderly and short _ just like our
candidate.''
   If elected, Dukakis would be the shortest president since
William McKinley (5-foot-7) won office in 1896. The shortest was
5-foot-4.

   Smelling the fumes:
   Jesse Jackson's ``Rainbow Express'' bus caravan rolled through
five states en route to Atlanta in airconditioned comfort. But once
in the convention city, the means of transport changed to
dilapidated, non-airconditioned school buses.
   Two of them carried the Jackson press corps to a luncheon given
by former President Jimmy Carter. One broke down as it wheezed up
the Carter Center driveway.
   That meant squeezing the hot reporters, crews and cameras into
just one steamy bus for the trip back. It was too much for the bus.
It stopped dead on a slight grade but was revived to pick up the
reporters who decided the better part of valor was to walk.
   The rest of the journey was inch-by-inch, keeping fingers
crossed. For reporters it gave new meaning to the Jackson battle
cry: ``Keep hope alive.''

   Michelangelo Painted Ceilings, Didn't He?
   You can hardly go anywhere in this town without bumping into
reporters, a species identified by a ``where-do-I-get-a-story''
look that's unmistakable. But there's danger of stepping on others
in the public arts, too.
   Outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel, which is Michael Dukakis'
headquarters, Sidewalk Sam _ also known as Bob Guillemin of
Massachusetts _ is doing his thing. His thing being painting chalk
portraits on sidewalks. Big portraits.
   The likeness he's doing now? Who else but the Duke?
