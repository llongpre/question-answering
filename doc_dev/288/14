<TEXT>  A The yellow lines usually are used at stadiums that have tall walls
relatively close to home plate. Raising the height at which the line is
painted has the same effect as moving a fence back and compensates for the
closeness of the wall. If balls had to be hit over such tall walls, it would
make home runs in that part of the park nearly impossible.;    Such lines are
used at Seattle's Kingdome and the Metrodome in Minneapolis, indoor parks
where the right-field wall is very tall and close to the plate.;    Busch
Stadium in St. Louis, where there is no outfield fence and the bleacher wall
is relatively tall and far from the plate, has a yellow line painted
completely around the outfield below the top of the wall to make home runs a
bit easier to hit.;  SPORTS FACT; Hang gliding feats; Men's records; (box)
