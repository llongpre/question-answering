<LEADPARA>  As if there weren't already enough things to worry about -- diet, exercise,
stress, cholesterol, smoking -- now people concerned about heart disease can
fear something immutable: shortness.;   Short men have significantly more
heart attacks than tall men, according to researchers at Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Men 5 feet, 7 inches or
shorter are 60 to 70 percent more likely to have a heart attack than men over
6 feet, 1 inch.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "What should shorter people do, since you can't change that?" asked
Patricia Hebert, the lead author of the study. "We would simply suggest that
all people be aware of their coronary risk profile. Height is just one factor,
and it's not a major one.";   Hebert released her findings, from a study of
22,071 male physicians, Monday at the annual meeting of the American Heart
Association.;   The results were met with curiosity and some amusement at the
convention of 27,000 physicians, researchers, nurses, medical students and
others.;   "I wish I were taller," mused Dr. Michael Rosen, a professor of
pharmacology and pediatrics at Columbia University. "Hopefully, the shorter
people will just exercise a little bit more and eat a little bit better and
get around it that way.";   In the study, part of a larger look at heart
disease and cancer in physicians, Hebert and her colleagues followed the
doctors for an average of five years. During that time, the physicians
suffered 378 heart attacks, 36 of them fatal. The shortest men were hit
especially hard.;   Each inch subtracts risk; "The taller you are, the less
your risk," said Hebert, an instructor at the hospital and the medical school.
"For every added inch of height, there was a 3 percent decrease in risk" of
heart attack.;   Hebert said a separate study of women by researchers at
Boston University found a similar link between shortness and heart disease.
She said she had no reason to believe that her findings with physicians could
not be extrapolated to the general public.;   Height may be a marker; It is
unclear why short people might be at higher risk. Height alone may not be the
reason, Hebert said. Instead, height may be a "marker" for some other, as yet
undetermined risk factor, such as narrower coronary arteries or reduced lung
function. In her study, Hebert controlled for all the known risk factors for
heart disease such as cholesterol levels, parental history of heart attacks,
exercise frequency and age.;   According to Hebert, studies have shown that
short people tend to have narrower arteries, perhaps leaving their arteries
more vulnerable to blockage. Similarly, shorter people tend to have less
powerful lung function, which has been associated with a higher risk of heart
disease.  </TEXT>
