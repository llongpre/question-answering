ON YOUR OWN: DOES HEIGHT MATTER IN A RELATIONSHIP?

Size, as well as beauty, seems to be in the eyes of the beholder. I printed a 
letter from a man who was unhappy that his height (5 feet, 4 inches) was a 
turnoff to many women, and he despaired about ever meeting anyone who could 
love him as he is. I asked my women readers to let me know if they would be 
disinterested in a man shorter than themselves. Some responded that it would be 
a problem; others said it would not, and several focused on other aspects of 
the issue. One woman responded: 
</P>
<P>
"I would be attracted to someone shorter than me, but, unfortunately, it's not 
that simple. Personality is a big part of it. Most short men that I have met 
seem to have a macho complex because of their height. They are usually trying 
to show off or prove how tough they are in one way or another. One man carries 
a lot of money; one uses weightlifting. Another lets everyone know what a great 
marksman he is. Granted that men of average height or taller may have the same 
hang-ups, but it usually seems they have less to prove." 
</P>
<P>
The opposite view of short men's personalities is expressed in this letter from 
a Massachusetts woman: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Reverence' 
</P>
<P>
"I have great reverence for these guys who are my height. I am 5 feet, 3 inches 
tall, but I have dated men who are shorter than me as well. It is my opinion 
that a 'short man' is more compatible. I don't know why, but I have found that 
shorter men are more kind and gentle than hulking monsters. Maybe I am in the 
minority, but I have been able to relate quite well with short men who feel 
that they are in the same minority as me. I have found shorter men to be more 
handsome, more socially conscious, more virile, more physically active, more 
intelligent and with greater endurance than some of the so-called Big Boys of 
male fame. I hope this letter gives your insecure reader a lift."

A California reader wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I have a boyfriend who is shorter than I am, and it does bother me. I am 6 
feet tall, divorced and have three children. It's really hard to find a nice 
tall man, so I stay with the man I have because he is a very loving, caring and 
devoted person and that's what I want in a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me because he looks like my younger brother instead of my mate, but 
we do have good times when I forget about his height." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an Indiana woman sends a message that can cheer both despairing short 
men and uncomfortable taller women. She writes: 
</P>
<P>
"I have been married for 19 years. My husband is 5 feet, 4 inches tall, but he 
is the tallest man I know. I wish people could be judged from the neck up. I 
never really think of him as being short. He's fantastic, great and my hero -- 
yes! But short -- no." 
</P>

Most people are drawn to certain physical types more than others. Some people 
have a much wider range of types that they find appealing than others. 
Fortunately, there is probably no type that no one is drawn to. We can't force 
ourselves to be attracted to someone, but, sometimes, if we become involved 
with a person who would not normally be our type but who is in many ways right 
for us, the attraction can grow. I know people who have passionately said to 
others, "You didn't used to be my type." 
</P>

On another subject, several readers responded to my answer to a woman who felt 
awkward and hesitant about calling a man she had met at a professional meeting. 
I wrote that while this is sometimes difficult for women to do because they 
generally are not used to taking the risk of being the one to call and face the 
possibility of rejection, she really had nothing to lose. If it's too risky to 
call him for a date, I counseled, call him just to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Most women reported that when they called, the men were glad to hear from them; 
a few said the men were put off by their call, and several said they had 
married or become romantically involved with the men they took the initiative 
to call. And there was this letter from a California man: 
</P>
<P>
"I met a woman in 1981 at a pub, and we exchanged phone numbers. I said I would 
call her, and we would go out and play darts. Well, I didn't call her. There 
was no reason -- I just didn't get around to it. After about two weeks she 
called me and said, 'I thought we were going to play darts.' We went out, and 
we continued to see each other. We were romantically involved for more than a 
year. We both realized that we were not interested in each other as marriage 
partners, but we have remained dear friends ever since. Although we live in 
different cities, we talk on the telephone every week, and we are planning a 
trip together. We have a great friendship, and it is all because she called me. 
So I say to all those women, go ahead and call the man if you want to. I am 
thankful she did."
