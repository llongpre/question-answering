   Tishman Speyer Properties Inc. said it plans to construct what would be Europe's tallest building: an 850-foot office structure in Frankfurt, West Germany. 

   The skyscraper, with about 920,000 square feet of space, will cost $375 million and will be financed by Citicorp and owned by Tishman Speyer, the developer said. 
Helmut Jahn, a German-born American, will be the architect. 
The building will be on the Frankfurt fairgrounds, an exhibition area. 

   Europe's tallest building currently is the Palac Kultury, a 790-foot office structure in Warsaw. 

   Jerry I. Speyer, president of the closely held developer, one of the largest in the U.S., said he hasn't yet signed up any tenants. 
However, he said he isn't worried because "they have a zero vacancy rate" in Frankfurt. 

   Mr. Speyer said his family ran a shoe-store chain in Frankfurt until the 1930s, when his father emigrated to the U.S. to flee the Nazis.
