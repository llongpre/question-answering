   Texas Giant has taken on Hercules, but
the title of ``world's tallest wooden roller coaster'' may wind up
being settled in the courts instead of on the tracks.
   The Texas Giant ride had barely completed its test runs before
it drew threats of a lawsuit from an Allentown, Pa., amusement park
that claims it has the tallest wooden roller coaster.
   Whether the new attraction at Six Flags Over Texas or the
Hercules at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom has the right to the
title is a bit confusing. There is no certifying agency and no
universally correct way to measure a roller coaster.
   Texas Giant has the highest first hill, at 143 feet. Six Flags
officials measure the ride from the loading station to the top of
the first hill, or lift. Hercules sports a lift of only 100 feet.
   But the Allentown Park says the correct way to size up a roller
coaster is by the length of its vertical drop. Hercules riders wind
up 157 feet lower than the height to which they are towed. The
Texas Giant's vertical drop is 137 feet.
   Dorney Park spokesman Harry Schmerling said the park plans to
protest the Texas Giant's claim as being false and to defend
Hercules' reputation as being No. 1. He said attorneys representing
his park are continuing to ``actively study'' the legal aspects of
the roller coaster tussle.
   ``It's a major difference between being the world's tallest
wooden roller coaster and not being the world's tallest wooden
roller coaster,'' Schmerling said.
   The Arlington Convention and Visitors Bureau already is
circulating materials promoting the new attraction in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area as being the world's tallest. Sandy LaPlant
said her agency won't change those materials unless ordered to do
so by Six Flags management.
   At any rate, the new roller coaster is an eye-opener. Or an
eye-closer, for those who find their courage quickly waning as the
cars creep toward the summit.
   Randy Geisler, president of the American Coaster Enthusiasts
club in St. Paul, Minn., hasn't taken sides, but he does plan to
take a spot in line. His group plans to hold its annual convention
in Arlington in June, and more than 400 members are ready to test
the Texas Giant, tallest or not.
