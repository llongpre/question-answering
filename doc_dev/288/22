FT  09 NOV 94 / Observer: Low poll turnout
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Americans went to the polls yesterday, choosing the best candidates
wasn't the only challenge some faced. What we must term the 'vertically
challenged' voters - observing all due political correctness - apparently
don't get a fair crack at democracy, because they aren't tall enough to read
the name at the top of the huge voting machines.
A researcher at Ohio State University has videotaped 19 people in a mock
polling booth. She finds that 44 per cent did not record any vote at the top
of the machine. 'It was too high for shorter people to see comfortably - 67
inches from the floor. The average American woman's eye height is only 60
inches,' says Susan King Roth.
This sits rather uneasily with other US research showing that Americans
usually vote for the tallest candidate. In all but one of the presidential
elections this century the taller candidate won; the exception was Jimmy
Carter's victory over Gerald Ford in 1976. And look what happened to him.
