   No order is too tall for Richlee Shoes,
which specializes in elevator shoes.
   It even sells elevator bedroom slippers.
   ``If you're going to be taller at the office and the company
picnic, why wouldn't you want to be taller at home? Won't the
neighbors notice if you run out to get the paper that you're
shorter?'' said Bob Martin, who operates the company with his
sister and three brothers.
   Ninety styles, priced $40 to $120, are displayed in 100,000
square feet of warehouse space just south of Frederick. It sells
direct and through mail order.
   ``We don't feel we've even scratched the surface'' of the number
of men who want to appear taller, said Martin. ``Depending on the
style, our shoes can make a man two inches taller. I've had people
call me up ... they say `the difference in my height has made a
difference in my social life.'''
   Elevator shoes have come a long way from the days when the
company's celebrity spokesman, Mickey Rooney, sported oxfords with
chunky heels that didn't hide their purpose. Today's elevator shoes
look like normal shoes but have a built-up insole.
   Martin said he even has one regular customer who stands 6-foot-5.
   ``I asked him why,'' he said. ``He said he was a basketball
player in college and all his friends were 6-feet-7 or 8.''

   A self-cleaning bathtub and salt dyed red
so that people can know how much they use. Sunglasses with pockets
and a life-preserver for horses.
   Those are inventions by kids involved in a program called Invent
America, which seeks to boost the level of creativity and
innovation in this country.
   At Dommerich Elementary School in this Orlando suburb,
fifth-graders are brainstorming their way to new ideas to resolve
problems, such as locating a dog at night or taking out the garbage.
   The Invent America class is taught by Gil Rowe one day a week to
each of five classes of gifted students in different grades. He
came from Ocoee Elementary School, which won four of Invent
America's nine state awards, the most of any school in the country.
   ``We've just kind of forgotten to teach the children the old
American ingenuity,'' says Rowe, 44. The program was started by the
privately funded U.S. Patent Model Foundation in Washington.
   Besides opening up the innovative process, Rowe says, the
program enhances students' self-esteem. One Ocoee second-grader who
was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented
a device that earned him his classmates' admiration.
   ``Suddenly he became a famous inventor. He just became a totally
different individual,'' Rowe said.
   The problem of finding a dog at night was addressed by
11-year-old Seth Swanson, who plans to develop a dog collar with a
light attached before the class ends with a school fair in April.
   Ten-year-old Robbie Cadle hates carrying the garbage cans out so
much that he concentrated all his efforts on that one issue.
   His solution? Motorized garbage cans that can be driven from the
house to the street, and back.
