   If you're a 6-foot-tall 13-year-old who can't
dribble a basketball, one of your options is to crack wise.
   For Brad Garrett, now 6-foot-9 and the star of CBS' ``First
Impressions,'' making jokes to make up for two left feet became a
successful career as a standup comedian.
   Now he's joined a growing legion of comics _ Garry Shandling,
Paul Reiser, Roseanne Barr, Bob Saget and Dave Coulier, for
instance _ who have made the transition from standup comedy to
situation comedy.
   ``It's funny,'' Garrett said. ``The transition a comedian has to
make, it seems, from the standup to the acting is trusting the
silence, not getting that immediate reaction and being comfortable
with that, because we're trained to be on the defense and always
have something to say.''
   What Garrett has to say often comes out in other people's
voices. ``First Impressions'' revolves around its star's ability to
mimic everybody from Bill Cosby to Hulk Hogan. Garrett plays a
voiceover actor in a small Omaha ad agency. He's also a single
parent trying to raise a teen-age daughter (Brandy Gold).
   ``First Impressions'' was to have been a summer replacement
series, but the writers strike pushed it into a more important role
as a quasi-fall series. It premiered Aug. 27 and runs until Oct. 22.
   The show is Garrett's second attempt at a sitcom. He made a
pilot a couple of years ago called ``Super Tomato.''
   ``It was about a grocery store,'' he said. ``Yeah. Wonderful.
And I was a clerk. ... I could send you a tape of that, really whip
your weekend into a frenzy, I think.''
   Before that, Garrett honed his standup skills, eventually
landing on the Las Vegas casino circuit. He chatted at a restaurant
in Manhattan on a break as the opening act with the Julio Iglesias
tour.
   Iglesias, he said, watched his act, but didn't always get it
since the Spanish singer doesn't speak much English.
   ``Unless you do an impression of Tito Puente, he's totally
lost,'' Garrett noted.
   The tour included 11 nights at Radio City Music Hall, not bad
for a 28-year-old comic. ``It's a dream to be able to walk out
there without a flashlight,'' Garrett said.
   Garrett is pretty darn noticeable even in Manhattan, just by
virtue of his height, but he was sporting a large, scraggly scar
down the middle of his nose that would draw a second look even in
this tough town. He had fallen off Iglesias' tour bus on a stop in
New Jersey.
   Clumsiness is what propelled Garrett into comedy, he said. He
moved around a lot as a kid. Imagine the reaction of basketball
coaches when he would arrive on the scene.
   ``I wasn't a jock. I mean, I can't walk and talk. ... I never
had the moves. Jews don't dribble anyway. It's the heritage.
   ``Everytime I'd go to a new school they (the coaches) would say,
this is it, this is the guy we've been waiting for, and when I'd
get on the court it was embarrassing. So I got into theater.''
   Getting into television was a little harder, a matter of getting
through the door _ literally. The producers of ``First
Impressions'' were so impressed by their 6-foot-9 find, they
constructed a special set to tone down the impact of his height on
screen.
   ``They had to make the set like 3 inches taller, enlarge the
doors and the countertops and the chairs,'' Garrett said. ``The
`elephant man' set I call it.''
   ``First Impressions'' airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. EDT.

   Elsewhere in television:
   `BURNING QUESTIONS' ON ABC _ Hugh Downs will anchor the
prime-time special ``Burning Questions: The Poisoning of America''
this Thursday, part of a week of ABC News programming on
environmental issues. Network News President Roone Arledge cited
this summer's drought in the Midwest, the national heat wave and
medical waste washing up on beaches as reasons for the special
focus. ``Burning Questions'' will ask just how much damage has been
done to the environment, and is it reversible. Other reports will
include a segment on water pollution on Friday's ``20-20'' and a
``Nightline'' sometime this week on the erosion of the ozone layer.
...
   THE (FIRING) LINE FORMS ON THE RIGHT. AND THE LEFT _ ``Resolved:
The Right is better able to deal with the Soviets than the Left.''
That is the question that will be debated by two all-star teams on
public television's ``Firing Line'' Wednesday. In this corner: the
show's host, William F. Buckley Jr.; former United Nations
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick; U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Arguing for the Left:
1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern; 1984 and 1988
presidential candidate Gary Hart; U.S. Rep. Patricia Shroeder,
D-Colo., and former arms negotiator Paul Warnke.
