Our nation's capital swelters in unforgiving damp heat this time of year, with 
no ocean breeze or low humidity to temper the weather. Even to someone wearing 
shorts and a T-shirt, Washington can be unbearable in mid-July. Which makes the 
thought of fighting a war in this heat, dressed in full wool uniform and 
carrying heavy equipment, overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
But that is exactly what happened 125 years ago this month at the battle of Ft. 
Stevens, when a nearly defenseless capital city came close to a Confederate 
takeover. At the height of that battle, a President would do what no other has 
ever done -- stand beside his troops as the enemy fired and tried to move in. 
</P>
<P>
It was a muggy Saturday. Jubal T. Early, the crafty Southern general who had 
long frustrated Union troops with his guile, had decided to take a big gamble: 
Attack Washington from the north, push into the heart of the city and rout 
Abraham Lincoln from the White House. As Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg would 
later note, Gen. Early had "marched his men on the Seventh Street Road that 
would lead him straight to the offices, arsenals, gold and silver of the United 
States government." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all able-bodied Union soldiers had been sent south, to join Ulysses 
S. Grant's campaign on Richmond. Raw recruits, older men and wounded just out 
of the hospital had been assigned to the capital's defenses. Unbeknownst to 
Lincoln, his Navy secretary had a steamer on the Potomac waiting to evacuate 
him from Washington. Telegraph lines had been cut and Washington was isolated. 
Washingtonians were fleeing the city by the wagonload -- ironically, heading 
north into Early's territory. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Ft. Stevens began after sunrise and the fighting was fierce. By 
afternoon the Union commander-in-chief was there in person to rally his troops 
and watch the swaying skirmish lines of blue and gray. Standing on a parapet 
facing the onslaught, the tall onlooker in stovepipe hat must have been an 
inviting target to the Confederates. An officer three feet away from Lincoln 
was shot down. Another was hit. But the President stood placidly, "with grave 
and passive countenance" according to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was eventually persuaded by the commanding general to get down below, 
but only after the President had ascertained that his troops would prevail and 
the capital would stay in Union hands. It had been a stunning moment of courage 
and compassion by a chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Stevens today sits in a quiet, run-down neighborhood six miles north of the 
White House. The raised wall of earth that Lincoln walked across to reach his 
vantage point is still intact. A mounted rider patrols the grassy area, lending 
an almost timeless air to the battleground. A few blocks past Ft. Stevens, 
wedged between two aging structures, is a diminutive national cemetery holding 
the remains of men who fell in defense of Ft. Stevens. A little farther up the 
road, in a suburban churchyard, lie Confederates who were stopped at Ft. 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the countless visitors to Washington each year stop by these sites. But 
those who do experience something special. For it is here that the nation came 
close to changing direction. And it is here that a leader set an example for 
generations to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as passions are unleashed over the burning of one flag, it is important 
to remember someone who stood tall when the flag was truly under fire.
