GARDENS are still on fast-forward. As we enter August, flowers are already
shaping up for September. Acceleration exposes weakness. In my gardening,
the weak spot is late summer height.
Most nurserymen do not make the problem easier. They assume we all have
smallish gardens and therefore we need smallish plants.
Height is not dependent on length or width. An old rule in gardening-books
says that it is and that the tallest plants in a border should be no more
than twice the height of the bed's width. Like most old rules, it needs to
be broken. The contrast between great height and surrounding flatness has a
bold baroque quality which is all the better for breaking rules.
Notoriously, modern breeders are even less help because they breed for
dwarfs. I cannot think of a plant bred for height as a virtue: on trial
grounds, the virtues of compactness and mounded shape are always emphasised.
It has now become a struggle to find decent plants of the tall milk-blue
Campanula lactiflora, which is such a mainstay at five feet in early July.
Symptomatically, suppliers have replaced it with a shorter, dull variation
and named it Pouffe. Anchusas have shrunk and delphiniums have been named
after pygmies. There may or may not be fairies at the bottom of your garden,
but at the back of it there are unlikely to be giants.
Academic life requires me to find them. One of my jobs is the slow reshaping
of two long borders in my Oxford college, where the soil is very dry against
the old city wall. In August, its main season is over, but interest has to
flicker on among the deadheads. A few answers are emerging, among several
characteristic failures: the answers could apply to any garden, however
small.
The most successful is so obvious that we might forget it: in a tight
corner, go for Hollyhocks, to a height of 10 feet. Breeders have reduced
them, too, but nobody dares to eliminate the giants. They look particularly
dramatic, if you limit their colours to dark maroon-purple and white by
buying named plants in these colours during the spring. They look less
dramatic if you make my mistake and leave the choice to the nurseryman who
sells you indiscriminate pinks and reds. Hollyhocks refute old rules because
their roots go strongly downwards and their lower stems do not require a
great width of flower-bed. Most of their growers know better than to expect
any fresh lower leaves on their plants, anyway. They recognise that
Hollyhocks are victims to the unstoppable disease of rust. They flower well
above its ravages and so I have devised a remedy. In borders, I recommend
hiding their lower stems behind groups of tall Michaelmas daisies, which are
growing healthily with dark-green leaves just as the Hollyhocks' legs are
corroding. There is no point in planting the better-known forms of
Michaelmas daisy, which are usually novi-belgii hybrids. Most are prone to
awful mildew. The lesser-known novae-angliae forms resist disease and are a
better buy.
Height often entails coarse leaves, one reason why we have scrapped our big
Buddleias and given up the thistly Echinops with its big heads, like a
hedgehog's drumstick, in pale violet or white. For elegance, the old plume
poppy, or Macleaya, is a much better bet. The grey leaves are like the ace
of clubs: most of us buy microcarpa, although other forms are possibly
better. The roots run quite widely, and, after two years, the plant is six
feet high. I suppose I should not be surprised to find plants selling for
Pounds 5 each in garden centres in London.
On less familiar ground, I have high hopes of a pale yellow daisy called
Helianthus Lemon Queen. It reaches six feet; it needs no staking; the
flowers really are a pale yellow and a decent size and the plant can be
multiplied easily from summer cuttings. We have packed it in the back row
beside the white spikes of the excellent Veronicastrum, as botanists have
renamed Veronica virginica. This slender plant reaches six feet above
purplish foliage and the white form is charming.
If the soil is not too dry, the options are much wider. In the half-shade of
a town garden, my first choice for emphasis in August would be one of the
Cimicifugas, those plants with tall stems and flowers like white bottle
brushes. The best is a new one called ramosa Brunette, which has very dark
leaves without being sombre. Brunette will cost you an arm and a leg until
it has been more widely propagated, but it is worth the expense because the
contrast of flower and leaf is so good. At even greater height, you might
also try late-flowering clematis trained up tripods of tall bamboo canes.
Grand gardens exploit this trick, but two or three wigwams would lift the
sides of any small garden into a new class in late summer. The long canes
need only be added above a lower frame in July. That method avoids a bare
wigwam of tall stakes in May behind the lupins.
My favourite giant is none of these good plants, and, if I could torture it
for another foot in height, it would be ideal. So many new red crocosmias
have been bred or revived that we have even forgotten the days when we knew
them all as montbretias. Most of us have forgotten the older variety which
nurserymen used to list as a curtonus. It grows five feet high and its fans
of fresh green leaves send up sprays of vivid red flowers, which last for
weeks. It is too good for botanists to leave it in peace: recently, they
have renamed it Crocosmia paniculata, which will probably confuse everybody
for another 10 years. Resist the confusion, because this old variety is
spectacular near the back of any bed: it is a giant among the newer pygmies
and it has not been tamed merely by changing its names.
