<LEADPARA>  THE American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society recently proclaimed -- get this
-- that high heels are a pain. Women have known that for years.;    This
revelation was trumpeted on front pages of newspapers across the country,
causing women with first-hand knowledge of pinched nerves, hammer toes,
bunions, corns and callouses to shake their heads. What will the researchers
find next? That men find neckties an uncomfortable encumbrance?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     After surveying 356 women, Los Angeles orthopedic surgeon Dr. Carol Frey
found that 88 percent of them were wearing shoes at least a size too small.
Again, this comes as no surprise to most women, especially since Frey's
research showed the proper shoe width for most women -- a "C" -- is virtually
unavailable in regular retail outlets.;    Still, there is the question: Why
do women wear high heels?;    In part, it's a rite of passage. Little girls
fantasize about the day they can wear lipstick, perfume and high heels, just
like Mom. Exchanging Mary Janes for low-heeled pumps is a visible sign of
graduation from little girl to young adult.;    As they grow older, young
women learn the appeal of high heels -- they make you taller, they make your
ankles and legs look slimmer and many men consider them sexy. In American
society, there is little women won't do if the result is looking taller,
thinner and sexier.;    So what's a little pain? In fact pain and discomfort
are an integral part of the history of shoes.;    Take platform shoes. They
were worn in Greece in 300 B.C. by actors wishing to look "larger than life
and as powerful as gods." In 16th-century Venice, they were called chopines
and they were so high that servants had to help women walk. In the late '60s
and early '70s, both men and women tottered around on platform shoes, creating
urban legends of automobile accidents caused by shoes becoming jammed between
the accelerator and brake pedal.;    Now, purveyors of vintage clothing report
old platform shoes are hot sellers and a few manufacturers are trying to
revive the look with '90s versions. One designer, John Fluevog of Vancouver,
is making pilgrim-buckled shoes with 5-inch soles; prices start at $175.;   
Superstitious 14th-century Europeans believed pointed shoes would render
witches powerless, so the upper classes took to pointed shoes with a
vengeance. The longer the points, the higher your rung on the social ladder.
Eventually points on poulaines, as the styles were called, grew as long as 12
inches and people had to wear chains attached to their knees to hold the toes
up so they could walk.;    Then there was the Chinese custom of binding a
woman's feet. This crippling custom -- designed to make the feet as small as
possible -- was practiced even into this century, until it was outlawed in
1911.;    Today, women still bind their feet into shoes that are too pointed
in front and too high in back. But there are signs of change.;    When subway
workers in New York City went on strike a decade ago, women started wearing
athletic shoes to walk to work in. And when the strike was settled, they were
loath to give up the comfort. Manufacturers started responding with dress
pumps made with additional foam linings, thicker rubber for shock-resistant
soles and softer leathers. Now you can find a variety of comfort-oriented
dress pumps with names such as Soft Spots, Easy Spirit and Town Walker. Al
Gold, regional marketing director of the Cobbie Shop shoe stores, says 75
percent of his sales are of heels 1 inch or lower.;    Today there also are as
many flat and low-heeled dress shoes as ones with high heels. No longer are
high heels the only shoes to be seen during high fashion shows. Most designers
now show a mix of flats and high heels.;    Savvy women also have learned the
wisdom of mixing shoe styles and heights, saving the killer heels for special
occasions and enjoying low-heeled pumps or flats for work and play.;    Still,
when the temperature is in the 90s this summer, you can go to the car races at
Laguna Seca and see women wearing a certain style of high heels -- known by a
popular but unprintable slang term -- as they stroll around. They'll also
probably have on shorts and a Ferrari T-shirt. And they won't be caring one
bit if their feet hurt. They want the look those heels give them.;    No
matter how many surveys are done on the topic, women are unlikely to learn
anything they don't already know. And they are even more unlikely to change.; 
  It's a matter of personal choice. And looking thinner, taller and sexier.  </TEXT>
