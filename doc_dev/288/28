   President Bush, angered by Daniel
Ortega's threat to resume fighting with the Contras, derided the
Nicaraguan president on Saturday as a ``little man'' and an
``unwanted animal at a garden party.''
   Ortega, a bit more diplomatic, responded that Bush was just
reacting defensively.
   What triggered Bush's temper was Ortega's surprise announcement
Friday _ between meetings at the summit of Western Hemisphere
leaders _ that he would break off the cease-fire with Contra rebels
that has been in place since March 1988.
   At a news conference Saturday, Bush mocked Ortega's decision to
wear a military uniform to a meeting of democratic leaders. He
called Ortega an ``outcast'' and an ``unwanted animal at a garden
party.''
   He said Ortega had embarrassed himself in front of the
hemisphere's leaders. ``I do know that President Arias got a hold
of him last night and spoke very directly to him,'' said Bush,
adding that two other presidents did as well.
   Just hours before declaring his intention to end the cease-fire,
Ortega shook hands with Bush at a brief encounter. The Nicaraguans
eagerly released photos of the two presidents together; the White
House withheld its shots.
   Bush said Saturday that instead of ``seeking a photo
opportunity,'' Ortega should be talking to the U.S.-backed Contra
guerrillas, ``to his own people.''
   Twice he referred to the 5-foot-10 Nicaraguan as a ``little
man.'' Asked why he used that description, the 6-foot-2 Bush
snapped, ``Because he is, that's why.''
   Ortega, upon returning to Managua, responded: ``This is a
totally defensive attitude on the part of President Bush.''
   His spokeswoman, Maria Cristina Arguello, quoted Ortega as
saying: ``The tone of the (Bush) statements was not in harmony with
the spirit of the summit.''
   ``Little man'' may not have been the best phrase for an American
president to use in Latin America, where Uncle Sam is often
portrayed as a tall, blue-eyed devil taking advantage of short,
brown Indians.
   Ortega is actually tall for a Central American. Arias, their
mutual host, is closer to average at 5-foot-6.
   Arias said nothing publicly about the contretemps, but his
spokesman Jorge Urbina said Ortega had insulted ``all the
democraticlaly elected presidents of Latin America and the
Caribbean.''
   Later, Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, told
reporters aboard Air Force One that Bush meant ```little man' in
the sense of small man, petty.''
   Scowcroft, who stands 5-foot-8, added, ``He doesn't call me a
little man.'' The retired Air Force general said Ortega ``stepped
on his necktie'' at the hemispheric gathering.
