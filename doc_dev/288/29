   A middle school music instructor was singing
a sweet tune Tuesday after finding the right measures for a chair
to fit Sandy Allen, the world's tallest woman.
   The chair was one of many gifts the 7-foot-7\ Allen received at
a party in her honor.
   ``It is our way of showing appreciation for the way she faced
challenges to make something of her life,'' said Cynthia Prime, a
longtime friend of Allen's who coordinated the ``High on Life''
party.
   Allen, 32, is recognized as the world's tallest woman by the
Guinness Book of World Records.
   More than 150 groups and people became involved in the project
to honor Allen. The $8,500 in gifts included clothing, a quilt and
a leather handbag.
   Frank Penwell estimated he spent 20 hours building the wooden,
upholstered chair, which Allen sat on for the first time Tuesday.
   ``I decided to make the chair when my wife became involved in
the project and we realized that Sandy had special needs besides
clothing,'' he said. ``Designing furniture is my hobby.
   ``I knew how tall Sandy was and I estimated what size the chair
should be,'' he said. ``The top of the chair is 56 inches high and
the seat is 24 inches wide. The seat is 28 inches off the ground
and 28 inches deep.''
   Allen said the chair was very comfortable.
   ``This day is just incredible. I can't believe how much this
thing snowballed,'' Allen said. ``It's nice to know that there are
people here who think so much about me.''
   The gifts are the latest in a series of special events for
Allen, who decided to leave her job last year at a Canadian museum
and return to Indiana. She once lived in Shelbyville, southeast of
Indianapolis.
   She started work in February as a secretary-receptionist in
Mayor William H. Hudnut's office.
   ``When I heard she types 93 words per minute, I decided we
should get her,'' Elena Leigh-Cohen, Allen's supervisor, said.
``We've had to make some adjustments in the office, like raising
her desk, and we're going to have a special chair made.''
