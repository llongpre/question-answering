   Members of the New Jersey Moonrakers Club
hold their heads high when they get together.
   They never meet in a place where they could bang heads on
doorsills, and they don't have to endure corny comments about
``How's the weather up there?''
   The Moonrakers Club is for tall people who prefer not to raise
the roof. To belong, women must be at least 5-foot-10, and men,
6-foot-2.
   ``It's a chance to walk into a room and stand up straight,''
said Lin Damon, club president, 5-foot-11{.
   ``I always slouched. It helped me gain new confidence. Tall
people become insecure at a young age,'' she said.
   Club rules are strict. If people don't measure up, they don't
get in.
   Applicants are checked in their stocking feet. No 5-foot-7 women
with three-inch spikes need apply, she said.
   Once in, though, allowances are made.
   ``We've had people shrink over the years, and they've maintained
their membership,'' Ms. Damon said. ``But you can't claim you
shrank before you applied.''
   Members share their large-size problems, such as houses with low
ceilings, uncomfortable airline seats and difficulty finding
clothes that fit.
   ``Why do stores think tall people only want to wear polyester?
We will spend money on clothes too,'' Damon said.
   The 100-member Moonrakers Club is part of Tall Clubs
International, a 50-year-old organization that ranks development of
the king-size bed among its biggest achievements.
   The Moonrakers' two tallest women are Maureen Ahlers of
Hackensack and Ann Riesenman of Butler, both 6-foot-3, she said.
Bob Burke of Woodridge leads the men at 6-foot-9.
   About the only thing members of the Moonrakers have in common is
height.
   ``We have different occupations, different levels of schooling
and a lot of different interests,'' said Damon, a purchasing agent
for Williams and Watts, a military procurement and materials firm.
   There's another plus. ``You can start up a conversation at a bar
with another tall person _ `You're tall, you might be interested in
this.'''
