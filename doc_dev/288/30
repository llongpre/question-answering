  [Excerpts] Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, Jordanian deputy prime 
minister and higher education minister, and his accompanying 
delegation arrived in Damascus via Dar'a this evening. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dr. al-Tall made a statement to a Syrian Arab News Agency 
correspondent in Dar'a. He expressed happiness at this visit, 
and said: On my visit to fraternal Syria, I would like first to 
convey to His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad greetings from 
His Majesty King Husayn. In my name and on behalf of the 
delegation, I also convey to His Excellency President Hafiz 
al-Asad profound appreciation, respect, and pride. 
  Dr. al-Tall added: We are emphasizing a consistent fact, in 
addition to the pan-Arab ties between both fraternal countries, 
which are two parts of a whole. The two countries are facing 
the challenges posed to the Arab nation. 
  He also lauded the strong cooperation and sisterly relations 
between both fraternal countries as well as the constant 
coordination between President Hafiz al-Asad and King Husayn for 
pan-Arab interests.
