The cocaine seizure Friday was the largest in world history, according to DEA 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the largest in U.S. history took place in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on 
Nov. 17, 1987, when agents seized 4.35 tons of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The largest previous seizure in world history, the DEA says, took place on 
March 10, 1984, in Tranquilandia, Colombia, when 11 tons were seized. 
</P>
<P>
HOW DOES IT TRANSLATE? 
</P>
<P>
Seizures: The haul was roughly four times as large as the total amount of 
cocaine seized citywide in Los Angeles in 1988, according to the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In the entire year of 1988, the LAPD seized 10,610 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the corresponding numbers for previous years: 
</P>
<P>
1987 -- 13,345 pounds 
</P>
<P>
1986 -- 13,184 pounds 
</P>
<P>
1985 -- 2,065 pounds 
</P>
<P>
1984 -- 758 pounds 
</P>
<P>
Height: LAPD narcotics officers say that an average kilogram brick of cocaine 
is roughly a foot long, six inches wide and five inches thick. The 20 tons 
amount to more than 18,000 kilograms. Using those figures, if the cocaine 
seized were stacked in kilogram packages, the pile would rise more than 7,500 
feet in the air, almost a mile and a half high, about half the height of Mt. 
Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S. It would also be 9 times the 
height of the First Interstate Bank Tower and 16 times as tall as City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Weight: The haul is equal to about four circus elephants, about 15 Toyota 
Celicas, or two fully loaded Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Money: Using a street value of $6.7 billion, the seized cocaine exceeds the 
annual sales of any industrial corporation in the United States except the top 
65 firms. For example, Texas Instruments' annual sales in 1988 were $6.2 
billion; Northrop's annual sales in 1988 were $5.8 billion, and Campbell Soup's 
annual sales in 1988 were $4.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The man considered the richest American, Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Moore 
Walton, has an estimated worth of $6.7 billion, according to the latest Forbes 
Four Hundred list. 
</P>
<P>
In another comparison, Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures this week for $3.4 
billion, and Anheuser-Busch bought the Sea Worlds parks for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1986, General Electric bought RCA (which included NBC) for $6.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Using that same $6.7-billion figure, the amount is larger than the gross 
national product of all but 67 nations worldwide. PAUL FELDMAN
