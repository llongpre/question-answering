<LEADPARA>  The shorter you are, the more likely you are to suffer heart attacks, a new
study shows. But the threat can be reduced by monitoring cholesterol and blood
pressure levels.;   The study was released Monday at the annual scientific
meeting of the American Heart Association. It was conducted by Dr. Patricia
Hebert and colleagues from the Physicians' Health Study at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "These findings appear to be generalizable to women as well as men," said
Hebert, who presented the study.;   For every extra inch of height, she found,
people's heart attack risk goes down 3 percent. This means that someone
5-foot-10 is 9 percent less likely than someone 5-foot-7 to suffer a heart
attack.;   "Hopefully, short people will exercise more and eat better to get
around it that way," said Dr. Michael R. Rosen of Columbia University.;   Why
shorter people are at higher risk is unclear. However, it might be because
their blood vessels are skinnier, and thus more prone to becoming clogged.;  
The researchers cautioned that just being tall is no guarantee of escaping
heart trouble. Loftier folks should still watch their diets and blood
pressures, among other things.;   In the study, men under 5-foot-7 had about
70 percent more heart attacks than those over 6-foot-1.;   The study was based
on a survey, begun in 1982, of the health of 22,071 male doctors from across
the United States. The primary goal was to check the effects of taking
aspirin, which turned out to reduce the risk of a heart attack by 44 percent.;
  However, the researchers used the huge amount of data collected to review
other links with heart disease.;   Several factors increase the risk of heart
attacks. The principal ones are smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes and high
blood pressure.;   The researchers found that shorter men were more likely to
be overweight and to have high cholesterol and blood pressure. But even when
these factors were taken into consideration, their risk of heart attacks was
still higher.  </TEXT>
