   President Bush indicated today he is
considering a visit to China next month in connection with his trip
to the Far East for the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
   ``Stay tuned,'' Bush replied when asked about a report that he
was planning a visit to China, where he served in the 1970s as this
country's first envoy to Beijing.
   The president was responding to a rpeort in the official Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug, which was reported from Beijing.
   The agency, quoting unnamed sources, said Bush would visit China
on Feb. 25-26 following his trip to Tokyo.
   Bush said ``I just don't know yet'' whether he'll go to China.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk, responding earlier to the
Yugoslav report, said ``there are no plans at this time'' for such a
trip.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu declined to confirm or
deny whether Bush would be making such a trip.
   ``I would suggest that you wait for the tall thin guy (Bush) to
sing, or the short bald guy (press secretary Marlin Fitzwater) to
tell you that the tall, thin guy has sung,'' he told reporters.
``There is no official announcement of that yet.''
   ``Nothing on the itinerary (of the Far East trip) is ready for
announcement yet,'' he said.
   There has been widespread speculation that Bush would use the
occasion of the Japanese trip to visit both China and South Korea
before returning to Washington from the trip to the Orient.
   His first trip out of the United States as president will be to
Ottawa on Feb. 10, for talks with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   The Canada trip will be the first outside the United States for
the new president. The White House press office said Tuesday that
Bush and Mulroney ``will discuss bilateral and international issues
of common concern'' during the one-day Ottawa visit.
   China's Foreign Ministry has not yet confirmed the report on
Bush's impending visit, but its spokesman has recently said that the
president ``would be welcome in China,'' Tanjug reported.
   It said Bush will hold talks with Chinese officials on bilateral
and other issues, especially political developments in the Far East.
   Tanjug said Bush, the first U.S. representative in China after
the two countries re-established diplomatic ties, ``is very popular
in Chinese political circles.''
   Bush was chief of the U.S. liaison office in Beijing in 1974-75.
