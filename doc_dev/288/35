   In the narrow and crowded lanes of the
old bazaar, a 25-inch-tall man sits in a store selling candy and
hoping to find a wife.
   ``It is a hard life to be a dwarf, and to be the world's
shortest living matured man is even harder,'' Gul Mohammad said in
his whispery voice as he counted coins and handed sweets to
children much taller than he.
   Mohammad is 3.3 inches shorter than the shortest living adult
listed by the 1988 Guinness Book of Records, Nelson de la Rosa of
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
   ``No one noticed me before, until a local newspaper reporter had
a chance meeting with a friend of mine, who told her about me,''
Mohammad, 32, said in an interview Tuesday.
   He is the eldest of four children of Noor Mohammad and Fatma
Begum.
   ``My first issue were twins, Gul and Zahoor. Both were
dwarfs,''' Fatma said in her one-room home in the Ballimaran
district of Old Delhi. ``Zahoor died after four years, but Gul
lived to become a man.''
   Her other children, a boy and a girl, grew to normal size.
   Gul, which means flower in the Urdu language, is lonely and
wants to get married. He was 10 when his father died. His mother
soon remarried, and Gul was sent to live with his maternal uncle,
where he stays today.
   ``I want to marry someone who is of normal height so that she
can carry me around, feed me and give me bath. ... I do not want to
live on the charity of my relatives forever,'' he said.
   His arms are so short that his hands ``can't reach his head
while bathing,'' said his aunt, Nargis Begum.
   Mohammad started his candy business with an investment of about
$35, but he has been robbed twice.
   ``I could not do anything. I have decided when I marry I will
ask my wife to sit with me in the candy store,'' he said with a
broad smile.
   Mohammad, whose only vice is smoking, giggles constantly.
   ``I used to get very upset when people laughed at me, but I
figured out if I laughed back that fixes them,'' he said.
   ``Being the shortest man is not a joke. It is a hard
existence,'' Mohammad said.
   Walking is difficult for Mohammad, who pays about 30 cents a day
to teen-agers who piggyback him where he wants to go.
   ``I can't get onto a rickshaw or sit on a bicycle. It is
difficult to balance,'' he said.
   Mohammad's neighbors are fond of him. ``He is our pride. When he
becomes world-famous, we will all be very, very happy,'' said
Ashraf Rizvi, a travel agent who brought Mohammad to the attention
of the National Herald newspaper.
   Mohammad's uncle, Manzoor Hussain, said a circus once tried to
buy him. ``I would have gladly agreed to let Mohammad work in the
circus but to lose him forever is something impossible.''
   He said the circus offered the equivalent of $14,285 for
Mohammad, a staggering amount in India where the per capita annual
income is $290.
   Hussain hopes Mohammad will find a bride.
   ``But who will marry him? Maybe one day when he is famous
someone will come and offer him her hand,'' the uncle said. ``But
the problem is that Mohammad wants a normal-height women, not a
dwarf like him.''
