OF THE COMMUNITY'S NAUTICAL CHARACTER

<P>
If it looks as if the water level in Newport Harbor is a little high for the 
next few days, don't be too quick to blame it on the tide. It could be the 
effects of SeaFest. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of antique and classic wooden boats, tall ships, electric boats, wind 
surfers, sailboats, runabouts, yachts and one 522-foot Navy vessel do, after 
all, displace a lot of water. 
</P>
<P>
They also are expected to attract more than 50,000 boat buffs and other salty 
types to the harbor and its environs for the first 10-day celebration of its 
kind in Newport Beach history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juggling the Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Newport SeaFest, which began Friday and ends Sept. 24,, is the first 
consolidation of several traditional Newport Beach summertime nautical events 
with a handful of new festivities designed to highlight the waterborne nature 
of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It all started with suggestions from a couple of (Newport Harbor Area Chamber 
of Commerce) members who were sitting around talking about how we could pull 
together a big community-wide event with the cooperation of service groups and 
agencies as well as the chamber," said Richard Luehrs, president of the Chamber 
of Commerce, the sponsor of SeaFest. 
</P>
<P>
"This was coupled with questions about why we couldn't do some of the things 
later in the year that we normally do in the middle of summer, like the 
Character Boat Parade and the Wooden Boat Festival. In mid-summer, there's so 
much traffic and congestion down here. We thought if these things were 
scheduled later, it'd be a little less hectic on people." 
</P>
<P>
So they did, and in the bargain added new events such as the Taste of Newport 
(which features live music and samples of food from 40 area restaurants), a 
fishing tournament and kite contest -- and the SeaFest Marine Art Festival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seamanship and Silliness 
</P>
<P>
The centerpieces of the festival are the traditional boating events, which show 
off seamanship, precise marine architecture, creativity and, in one case, plain 
silliness. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these is today's third annual Great Electric Boat Race, in which 
more than 40 electrically powered boats will compete in a rally around the 
harbor and in a "Rhine Channel Drag Race." The rally will begin at the Cannery 
restaurant (3010 Lafayette Ave.) at 11:30 a.m., where each skipper will be 
given a set of clues to solve which will lead to points around the bay, where 
the skippers will collect tokens. The final "drag race" will be held at the 
Cannery following the rally. 
</P>
<P>
The first visit to the Newport Harbor area of a Navy vessel in more than 25 
years will take place today and Sunday. The 522-foot-long U.S. amphibious dock 
landing ship Fort McHenry will be anchored off the Newport Harbor jetty for the 
weekend and will offer free tours. The Chamber of Commerce will offer 
transportation to the ship both days for $5. Transport tickets, good for a bus 
trip from Newport Center to the Harbor Master's dock and a launch from there to 
the ship, are available in advance only from the Chamber of Commerce offices 
(1470 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach), the Balboa Pavilion (400 Main St., Balboa) 
and the Meridien Hotel (4500 MacArthur Blvd., Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Next weekend will see the arrival of several old-timers and a few very 
old-timers as part of the Tall Ships Festival and the Wooden Boat Festival, 
both of which will take place at the Boy Scouts Seabase at 1931 W. Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Next Saturday, the tall ships "Pilgrim," "Resolution," "Argus" and others will 
be tied up at the Boy Scouts Seabase and will be open to boarding and tours for 
$3 (children 12 and under free). They are scheduled to sail into the harbor 
about 5 p.m. the day before, along with other classic and antique boats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wooden Boats on Display 
</P>
<P>
The same day, the third annual Wooden Boat Festival begins with a display at 
the Boy Scouts Seabase of more than 60 classic wooden craft, from sailboats to 
motorized runabouts. All boats are available for inspection for $3 (children 12 
and under free). 
</P>
<P>
Events during the day will include a wooden-boat sailing regatta (noon), a 
boat-building contest for children and adults (11 a.m.), and wooden-boat 
cruises (ongoing). 
</P>
<P>
Several of the wooden boats scheduled to be on display are owned by members of 
the Antique and Classic Boat Society, an international organization of wooden- 
boat fanciers. Roger Huebner of Newport Beach, the president of the Southern 
California chapter of the society, said that he would be sailing his own 1939 
Chris Craft runabout. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these old boats have their history right here in Newport Beach," 
Huebner said. "There's real enjoyment in seeing something that's old but looks 
new and is fully functional. People look at these boats and say, 'Where did you 
get that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Steele, chairman of the Wooden Boat Festival, said: "Some of these 
runabouts are worth about $150,000, and they're only 20 feet long. We're 
probably going to have about $7 million or $8 million worth of boats out there. 
Everybody's been spending the last few months sprucing their boats up. The 
owners have really gotten into this. There's so much pride in these boats, and 
love for them, that the owners won't put them in the show unless they're in 
great shape." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boat Owners Play Dress-Up 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 24, the final day of the festival, the zaniest of the events, the 
Character Boat Parade, sets sail. "Newport Harbor in the Roaring '20s" is the 
theme of the 29th annual bay cruise in which local boat owners decorate their 
boats in often outlandish ways. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will follow a new route, beginning at the Lido Marina turning basin 
at 1 p.m., continuing through the harbor and ending at the starting point (tall 
ships will sail with the parade for part of the route). The boats will be 
judged on best decorations, best sound, best animation, best costumes and best 
interpretation of the parade theme. There also is a "Dirty Old Manifold" award 
for the oldest boat. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the parade was hatched by local cartoonists Virgil Partch and Dick 
Shaw, who inaugurated it by sailing their 24-foot tug "Michigan" around the 
harbor with a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Partch and Shaw were Disney cartoonists at the time, and they painted the boat 
to look like Little Toot," said Jim Dale, a local restaurateur whose family now 
owns the "Michigan" and sails it each year in the Character Boat Parade. "They 
said, 'Let's do something for fun and get all the people with boats out there 
who want to get a little crazy and have a good time and all end up at a bar 
after the parade's over.' Now that the Commodore's Club of the Chamber of 
Commerce has taken it over, it's become real organized, but it's still a lot of 
fun. Our family likes to take the boat out and kind of wave the flag a little 
bit." 
</P>
