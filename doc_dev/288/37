   A team of scientists is going on a
Mount McKinley expedition to determine among other things: How high
is high?
   The team from the School of Engineering at the University of
Alaska-Anchorage will carry sophisticated measuring equipment up
North America's tallest peak.
   With the help of a satellite, the equipment will try to
re-measure the height of Alaska's most popular attraction,
currently recorded at 20,320 feet.
   But all that is of secondary interest to the scientists.
   Ron Cothren, an assistant professor of engineering, said the
team actually wants to measure the mountain's gravitational
attraction.
   ``What difference does it make if the mountain is a foot or two
higher?'' Cothran said Monday. ``What this will really do is give
us a feel for the effect of the mountain's mass. Right now, we have
no idea what kind of attraction McKinley has.''
   The experiment is being conducted with the National Geodetic
Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey. Equipment will be installed
and left at the mountain's 18,000 foot level, Cothren said.
   The team is to go Thursday to the climbers' base camp and leave
from there when weather permits.
   The experiment probably won't make the mountain officially
taller or shorter _ certainly no more than 100 feet each way,
Cothren said.
   Mount Rainier in Washington state was re-measured with the
satellite technique recently and was found to be 1{ feet taller
than its official measurement.
