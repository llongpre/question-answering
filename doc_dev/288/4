<LEADPARA>  A "squattie body" (tall talk for shorter person) looked up at 6-foot-9 Uwe
Seyler and asked, "Do you play basketball?";    "No," quipped the 50-year-old
German, looking down. "Do you play miniature golf?"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Such tall tales were told Sunday by members of International Tall Clubs
meeting at the Santa Cruz boardwalk before their annual convention in San
Mateo.;    Approximately 300 men (6 feet 2 or taller) and women (at least 5
feet 10) came from throughout America plus Canada and Europe.;    Many wore
T-shirts boasting of their height: "Kiss someone tall, it's worth the climb";
"Sure I'm tall but you can make two trips"; and "You have to be at least 5
foot 10 to ride this ride.";    They told short stories, too.;    Susan
Hopkins, Miss Tall Orange County, 37, who is 6 feet, said she and her cohorts
play softball annually with members of Short People of America but always
lose.;    "They always win because their strike zone is so small we end up
walking the whole team," she said.;    Most of the tall people appeared to
have outgoing personalities, quick to joke about their height. But in
interviews, they confessed their joviality was self-taught. They spoke of
growing up feeling that they were misfits.;    And, literally, nothing fit --
not clothes, not beds, not schoolroom or theater seats, not cars. But in the
53 years since the first Tall Club was founded, members have brought about
many changes by lobbying manufacturers. They say they are responsible for mass
production of king-size beds, push-back seats in theaters and tilt steering
wheels in cars.;    But they say the greatest change the clubs have made is in
the self-image of tall people.;    "We've learned to capitalize on a God-given
gift -- our height," said 6-foot Susan La Pierre of Philadelphia.;    The
conventiongoers also made a big impression on shorter folk, including a
teen-age boy whose jaw dropped as they passed by.;    "God, that's pretty
awesome," he said.  </TEXT>
