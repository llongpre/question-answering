   Watching ``Bullwinkle'' head into the
Gulf of Mexico on Friday brought tears to the eyes of some who
worked on the colossal offshore drilling platform that will be
taller than Chicago's landmark Sears Tower.
   ``We've worked hard for three years, and an event like this can
be somewhat emotional,'' said Gordon Sterling, Shell Offshore
Inc.'s project manager for Bullwinkle. ``There were a few tears
watching it go by.''
   After the 1,368-foot, 50,000-ton Bullwinkle settles on the ocean
floor off the Louisiana coast, workers will install a deck and two
drilling rigs, bringing the leviathan's weight to 78,000 tons and
its height to 1,615 feet.
   ``That compares to the world's tallest building, which is the
Sears Tower, which is about 1,450 feet,'' Sterling said. The
tallest drilling platform is the 1,132-foot Shell Cognac platform,
installed off the Louisiana coast in 1976.
   Spectators lined the ship channel at Port Aransas on Friday to
see the Bullwinkle off, and police had to direct traffic. Even
lying on its side, it had no trouble dwarfing everything in sight.
   ``I made a trip up from South Padre Island to watch Bullwinkle
go out,'' Sam McSpadden said. ``I used to live in this town and
I've followed its progress since its inception.''
   Sterling has been in charge of the Bullwinkle project during
three years of construction at the Ingleside yard of Gulf Marine
Fabricators, which Shell contracted for construction,
transportation and installation.
   ``We wish we were building another one right now, wish we had
another one to start just as big as it or bigger,'' Gulf Marine
vice president Myron J. Rodrigue said after watching nine tugboats
pull the barge carrying the huge steel drilling jacket through the
Corpus Christi Ship Channel.
   At the project's peak, 700 people were employed in building the
structure at Ingleside, Rodrigue said. Shell estimates the total
cost of the Bullwinkle project at $500 million, including
construction, installation and related expenses. The company would
not specify how much the structure itself cost.
   The Bullwinkle, with a base measuring 4{ acres, has been a
fixture on the horizon during its development, visible for several
miles on the flat coastal plain in the Corpus Christi area.
   Traffic on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway was diverted at the
beginning of May to prepare for loading the platform onto a
specially built barge that measures 853 feet long, 207 feet wide
and 49 feet deep.
   It is expected to take about three days to pull the structure
380 miles to its destination about 150 miles southwest of New
Orleans.
   The base will be flooded to bring the drilling jacket to rest in
1,353 feet of water in Shell's Green Canyon lease, with
installation expected to take about three months.
   Twenty-eight pilings for Bullwinkle will be driven 400 feet into
the sea floor and secured with cement. Bullwinkle is designed to
withstand at least a 72-foot hurricane wave, with the ability to
sway more than 6 feet without stress damage.
   Shell estimates that production will begin in the first quarter
of 1989, and will eventually put out 50,000 barrels of oil and 90
million cubic feet of natural gas per day.
   The Bullwinkle project was conceived nearly five years ago, when
oil was well above $20 a barrel, Sterling said.
   ``Even today at $15 it's a (profitable) venture,'' he said, but
added he will not brag until Bullwinkle is in place and producing.
   ``Bullwinkle'' was a code name given to the project when Shell
was bidding for the Green Canyon underwater site.
