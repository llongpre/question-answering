<TEXT>     But Dan McGwire has resisted his physical and genetic makeup to dabble in
what he says has always been his first love -- football.;    That infatuation
may make him a million bucks.;    "He's got a real shot of ending up among the
top players picked," said Leigh Steinberg, the Berkeley attorney who will
represent McGwire. "And because quarterbacks are so hard to find, he may end
up being the first player drafted.";    McGwire's height suggests he should be
a football anomaly. He's among the tallest quarterback ever to perform in
college football history, and he'll be the tallest to perform in the East-West
Shrine Game on Saturday.;    And when the 240-pound McGwire is drafted in May,
he will be among the tallest ever to play in the NFL. He will beat out
Cleveland's Bernie Kosar and the Los Angeles Rams' Jim Everett by three inches
as the tallest active quarterback in the NFL.;    But his statistics -- 528
completions out of 889 attempts for 7,484 yards and 43 touchdowns in just two
seasons at San Diego State after transferring from Iowa -- and sheer talent
have convinced NFL coaches that McGwire is more than some tall, red-haired guy
who can see over gargantuan offensive linemen.;    "Because he's so strong, he
seldom gets sacked," Steinberg said.;    And because his height puts him at a
better vintage point to survey the field, McGwire seldom was intercepted. His
1.56 interception percentage was the lowest in the country in 1990.;    "He'll
be drafted on his ability, pure and simple," said 49ers offensive coordinator
Mike Holmgren. "He's a big, strong guy, but what's important is that he's got
a great arm. That's where you start with a quarterback. He's got to be able to
throw it.";    McGwire threw bullet after bullet during the Shrine Game
practice at Stanford on Tuesday, which made you wonder what kind of heat he
could throw from the pitcher's mound.;    We'll never know. He says as far as
baseball is concerned, he's perfectly content to watch Mark perform.;   
"Baseball is boring. That game's too slow -- it's always put me to sleep,"
said McGwire, who played every position during his Little League days before
giving up the sport for good. "The only time it's exciting is when Mark
plays.";    McGwire grew six inches while at Claremont High School in
Claremont and wound up playing center on the basketball team, where he says he
averaged 20 points and 14 rebounds his senior year.;    But football was
always in the forefront, even when his high school growth pattern of two
inches a year showed no indication of slowing down.;    "I never went through
an awkward stage. I was always comfortable with my body," McGwire said.;    If
there was any lingering doubt about McGwire not fitting the quarterback mold,
he erased it during San Diego State's season finale against Miami, a
nationally televised game won by the Hurricanes 30-28.;    It wasn't so much
the amount of yardage -- 323 -- McGwire amassed but how he was able to get it
that was impressive. McGwire completed passes with defenders literally hanging
from his jersey, and in one instance switched the football from his right hand
to his left, then fired a completion.;    "I know a lot of people think of a
6-foot-8 football player as the lumbering type," McGwire said. "I don't feel
I'm the lumbering type at all. I feel I'm a good athlete.';    So does the
rest of the NFL.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The East-West Shrine Game will kick
off with a pageant at 11 a.m. followed by the game at 1 p.m. Saturday at
Stanford Stadium. Plenty of tickets remain for $5, $10 and $15 and are
available at the Stanford Box Office (1-800-BEAT-CAL) or BASS outlets
(762-BASS).  </TEXT>
