   Gitano Group makes jeans and underwear; Casual Male sells men's sportswear. 
In the depressed retail-industry climate, you'd think these two new over-the-counter issues wouldn't be very appealing. 

   Indeed, both stocks -- among the only 11 initial public offerings in the U.S. last month -- are trading below their offering prices. 
Gitano closed Friday on Nasdaq at 19 bid, down 1 1/2 from its initial offering price of 20 1/2, while Casual Male was quoted at 9 3/4, off its offering price of 10. 

   Yet some new-issues analysts are recommending the stocks either at current levels or a little lower. 

   Robert S. Natale, who researches new issues for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., favors Gitano at 19 or below and recommends Casual Male at its current price. 
In general, new issues that are less than red-hot aren't as vulnerable to negative earnings surprises, he says. 

   "I recommend that investors buy new issues in industries that are out of favor," he says. 
"If investors are undervaluing the retail group, then I think Gitano will benefit at this level. 
But my favorite is Casual Male," he says. 

   Gitano makes -- and heavily advertises -- jeans, sportswear and intimate apparel sold in discount stores. 
Sales and earnings in the past five years have grown about fivefold. 

   Though Mr. Natale had earlier recommended against Gitano, partly because of the volatility of the women's clothing business, he says Gitano "has some appeal" currently. 
Gitano's pre-issue road show impressed analysts who fear that family-run businesses such as Gitano will be short on management talent. 
Chairman Morris Dabah scored points by parceling out responses to analysts' queries to subordinates. 

   Norman G. Fosback, editor of New Issues newsletter, says Gitano is "attractive" at 18. 
Start-up costs for Gitano's new menswear line and the unfavorable retail climate are drawbacks, says Mr. Fosback. 
These problems made the offering price high for his taste, says Mr. Fosback, but Gitano's earnings growth makes the stock appealing at lower levels. 

   Though Gitano trades on Nasdaq, it plans a move to the New York Stock Exchange "relatively soon," says a spokesman. 

   As for Casual Male, Mr. Natale likes its rapidly expanding Big &amp; Tall stores' "important niche" of catering to 42-inch-or-bigger waists and 6-foot-3 or taller frames. 
Others worry that Casual Male could easily be hurt if it had competition. 
And Mr. Natale concedes a recession would derail its growth. 

   A cautionary word on buying new issues in depressed industries comes from Kenneth P. Pearlman, president of ShareVest Capital Management. 
ShareVest focuses on consumer-oriented stocks, many of them new issues. 

   "There is no question these stocks are cheaper than they'd be a year ago -- but so are comparable companies with much longer track records," especially in recessions, says Mr. Pearlman. 
He says that instead of Gitano, there's a proven stock such as Liz Claiborne, and that instead of Casual Male, there are Charming Shoppes or Paul Harris Stores.

   Friday's Market Activity
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed Friday at 385.67, up 0.52, despite weakness in several big technology stocks such as Lotus Development, Sun Microsystems, Novell and Intel. 
Volume of 154.9 million shares was Nasdaq's heaviest in 3 1/2 months. 

   Neutrogena fell 4 1/4 to 29 3/4; Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Earl Hamlin said the stock probably will underperform the market over the next few quarters. 

   Overall, 1,014 Nasdaq issues advanced and 902 declined, though declining volume was higher because of the drops in big technology stocks.
