Imagine a world in which short children are treated with a drug to make them 
taller. Although it borders on the Brave New World -- depicted in the 1930s 
novel by Aldous Huxley in which human embryos were tampered with so that they 
developed standard traits -- the technology necessary to turn this science 
fiction into fact is already being explored. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, physicians have been treating some midget children with growth 
hormone extracted from human cadavers to boost their height by the time they 
reach adulthood. (Unlike dwarfs, who have disproportionately large heads in 
relation to their limbs and torso, midgets are proportionately short). 
</P>
<P>
But only since 1985 has genetic engineering made it possible to generate the 
hormone in large enough quantities to be used for short children who are 
growing so slowly that they are not expected to reach more than 5 feet, 3 
inches if they are boys or 4 feet, 10 inches if girls. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., 
is currently conducting clinical tests to assess the effectiveness of growth 
hormone in these "normal" children, who, unlike midgets, do not have a classic 
growth hormone deficiency. The results will not be in for at least 10 years, 
but that has not stopped some doctors from using the therapy on such children. 
</P>
<P>
The use of growth hormone is presenting an ethical dilemma in a society that 
often measures the worth of people by their height. Others argue that no 
substance, regardless of one's ethical point of view, should be used widely 
until it is proven safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent state-of-the-art conference on growth hormone therapy sponsored by 
the Swedish Medical Research Council in Stockholm, about the only point 15 
experts on the therapy could agree on was that tests used to detect a growth 
hormone deficiency are not reliable, said Louis Underwood, a University of 
North Carolina pediatric endocrinologist who attended the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Without dependable tests, physicians cannot separate children who are growing 
slowly because of a medical condition that is stemming their growth hormone 
production from children who are merely following a family tradition of being 
short. While it makes sense that physicians should correct the former, treating 
genetically short children with the hormone raises thorny ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
Short stature is not necessarily a disease, points out Leona Cuttler, a 
University of Chicago pediatric endocrinologist in an article in the Journal of 
the American Medical Assn. last year, but part of the normal variation in human 
appearance. Physicians who try to boost a normal short child's height with 
growth hormone may be likened to plastic surgeons who try to improve appearance 
with nose jobs and tummy tucks. 
</P>
<P>
But consenting adults submit to these cosmetic procedures, not children. 
Because growth hormone therapy is only thought to be effective in children and 
not full-grown adults, a child's parents and physician must decide if he should 
be treated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful when deciding whom to treat," says pediatric 
endocrinologist Gilbert August of George Washington University. "Often it isn't 
the kids who are worried about being short, but their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"These parents, who are short themselves, vicariously relive through the child 
their own failures in high school about not being able to make the team, etc. 
I've often joked that if you could just do a 'parentectomy' these kids would be 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
But even without parental pressures, short stature can be emotionally costly in 
our society, which values height. "The money you save by not giving growth 
hormone," says August, "you may as well give to a psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists cite studies showing success is tied to height, with taller 
people making more money or having more prestigious jobs on the average than 
shorter individuals. The midgets who portrayed the munchkins in the movie "The 
Wizard of Oz," for example, earned less money than the dog Toto. 
</P>
<P>
Short height, however, is a relative term that is dependent on the range of 
height in a population. When August told a group of dwarfs, for example, about 
the possibility of using growth hormone to boost a normal but short boy's final 
adult height from 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches, they were horrified. 
"People 5 feet tall are like giants to dwarfs who typically aren't taller than 
4 feet, 3 inches," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, a child is short if he is in the lowest 5% of height in a normal 
population. But if doctors were able to effectively treat all these children 
with growth hormone, they would not eliminate short stature but rather create a 
new crop of short kids -- there will always be someone in the short range of 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Where to draw the line and decide whom to treat with growth hormone is a 
dilemma we're struggling with right now," says pediatric endocrinologist Susan 
Rose of the University of New Mexico Medical Center in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of growth hormone therapy is also an issue. "We're talking 
$60,000 to $70,000 per inch," says pediatric endocrinologist Melvin Grumbach of 
UC San Francisco. "Is a few inches worth the equivalent of what it costs to 
send a kid to college?" 
</P>
<P>
Another reason not to treat a normal short child with growth hormone, Grumbach 
added, is that "the jury is still out" on the effectiveness and long-term 
safety of the therapy used on these children. "If you know a therapy is 
effective and has no risk tied to it, you do it," says endocrinologist Gordon 
Cutler of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. "But if 
both the risk and the effectiveness are uncertain, you should do nothing and 
let nature take its course, or you should enroll the patient in a clinical 
trial so we can learn what the risks and benefits are." 
</P>
<P>
There are no clear-cut health risks associated with growth hormone therapy, but 
there are some unconfirmed findings that indicate the therapy -- which usually 
consists of three injections of the hormone per week for several years -- might 
boost a person's chances of developing diabetes, hypothyroidism or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we knew the therapy would give a person a four-inch gain in their final 
adult height rather than just a two-inch gain, the risks are probably worth 
taking," says Cutler, "but we don't know that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Since most normal children who have been tested with growth hormone therapy 
have not reached adulthood yet, their final gain in height is not known. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the parental pressure on pediatricians to treat more short 
children with growth hormone is building. "Unfortunately, everybody imbues 
growth hormone with magical qualities because we value growth so much," says 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
What decisions pediatricians make on whom to treat with growth hormone will 
have bearing on the use of future therapies likely to be developed to boost the 
appearance rather than the health of children. "If pediatricians do not respond 
to these dilemmas thoughtfully, carefully and forcefully," Cuttler wrote in her 
article, "other decision makers, whose decisions may reflect political, social 
or market forces, may then respond in ways that do not reflect the best 
interests of children."
