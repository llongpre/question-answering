BUSH VISIT TO DRUG SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He fell for it. There, on the evening news, President Bush standing before 
reporters and public in Orange County; behind him to the left a tall pyramid of 
those bags of white drugs we've all become so numb to seeing on television 
(there seems to be a competition among law enforcement groups on constructing 
the most impressive stack). Next to him on the right an equally tall pile of 
bundled U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
At a glance the image looks like a large balance scale with the President as 
its center. 
</P>
<P>
And the message this scene relays to too many viewers, especially those most 
impressionable: Drugs equal money. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure neither the President nor his PR adviser intended that it come across 
this way. They take the news media approach of using U.S. dollars as a measure 
for quantities of confiscated illegal drugs (as was the currency displayed). 
</P>
<P>
Rarely, if ever, is a news story written where a "street value" figure is not 
attached to a quantity of drugs seized in a drug bust, often in headlines or 
evening news teasers. The wise reporter appreciates the sensational value of 
that figure; the naive believes it to be quantitative. 
</P>
<P>
But using a "dollar-value" figure in discussing illegal drugs is much too 
subjective. To me and, I hope, to a majority of citizens, the value, dollar or 
otherwise, of one ounce or one ton of marijuana, crack, coke, heroine is zero. 
We wouldn't buy it, sell it, trade it, or touch it. If we saw it on the street, 
we would pass right by, as many people do in their cities and neighborhoods 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
It is an unfortunate choice to continually use the illegal drug retailer's 
price as a figure for measuring illegal drug amounts. It would be more accurate 
to continue to recount measures of weight or volume, whether it be stone, 
pound, or kilogram; even cubic feet will do for comparison. You could even use 
a misery factor, such as: "enough to kill 100 athletes, or cause 1,000 people 
to become hopelessly addicted." 
</P>
<P>
Unless you want to send the message that drugs equal money (or gold, or 
Ferraris), and ultimately that drugs and money are exchangeable, if not 
interchangeable, refrain from the visual and mental images of association that 
have become commonplace in news reporting and law enforcement publicity. The 
"street value" method is a dangerously wrong approach.
