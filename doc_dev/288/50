   It's the battle of the monster roller
coasters, white-knucklers designed to scare you silly, and it's
just in time for youngsters on spring vacation to buy a thrill.
   But at $17-plus, these thrills aren't cheap.
   Thirty miles from downtown Los Angeles, in opposite directions,
the Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement parks
are fighting to outdo each other by unleashing multimillion-dollar
fright machines.
   Knott's, to the southeast in Buena Park, promises its new $5
million Boomerang coaster will elicit ``the primal scream.'' Magic
Mountain at Valencia, to the northwest, says its $8 million Viper
coaster provides ``the most frightening ride on earth.''
   They are the latest in the nation's decade-long competition to
see who can build the biggest, fastest and scariest amusement park
attraction.
   The battle sometimes ends up in court. In Allentown, Pa., the
Dorney Park amusement park recently filed a lawsuit in federal
court to stop Six Flags Over Texas from claiming it has the
nation's tallest wooden roller coaster.
   Advertisements claim the $5.5 million Texas Giant coaster is the
highest at 143 feet, compared with 95 feet for Dorney's Hercules
coaster. But Dorney Park insists Hercules is 157 feet, because it
drops over a cliff, and the Texas Giant 137 feet.
   ``Coaster enthusiasts go all over the country looking for
moments of negative gravity,'' said Paul Ruben, editor of Roller
Coaster! magazine. He planned to be on hand today when Viper opens
to the public.
   ``Viper is a megacoaster that precisely defines the next step in
roller coaster evolution. Viper is, quite simply, the ultimate
scream machine,'' said Magic Mountain president Joseph Schillaci.
   Viper sends cars racing 70 mph over a course that reaches 188
feet high and includes seven loops during a 2{-minute run.
   Padded over-the-shoulder locking harnesses keep passengers
inside and ``fail-safe air brakes'' on the track are computer
controlled to assure proper ride speed.
   Asked about the safety of Boomerang, which also has padded
shoulder harnesses, Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville said
structural experts employed by the amusement parks examine thrill
rides daily. There are no checks by government agencies, although
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration does inspect
carnival rides.
   ``We've never had a ride-related fatality. Every ride is
inspected every single day by our safety inspectors,'' Zanville
said.
   Magic Mountain markets the Viper as the world's tallest looping
roller coaster. The nation's tallest roller coaster is the
205-foot-high Magnum XL 200 at the Cedar Point amusement park in
Sandusky, Ohio, but it doesn't loop.
   But the president of the 2,000-member American Coaster
Enthusiasts group says pacing, steepness and the severity of turns
are more important factors than size.
   ``You could have a ride 50 feet tall and it could scare the
beejeebees out of you,'' said Randy Geisler, the Chicago-based
association's leader.
   Knott's Berry Farm understandably agrees with Geisler _
Boomerang pales in size compared to Viper.
   Boomerang cars make the outbound and return trips on the same
875-foot-long track. Riders are first pulled backward to the top of
a 125-foot tower, then released to hurtle through three vertical
loops before ascending another tower for the ride back. It lasts 90
seconds.
   ``During the ride, you have the sensation that you actually have
fallen off the track. With ours, it's not the height or the speed,
it's how you feel when you get off,'' said Zanville.
   There are similar rides at Six Flags Over Texas near Dallas and
Canada's Wonderland theme park in Toronto.
   Roller coaster popularity peaked in the 1920s with more than
1,500 in operation in the United States. By 1978, only 147 were
left in North America.
   But there will be 203 coasters in operation by the end of this
year, with 17 new, moved or renovated ones opening.
