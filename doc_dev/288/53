<LEADPARA>  And so we have the results of the Miss Tall International Pageant, which took
place earlier in the week in San Mateo. After the judges finished looking up,
they named Rose Carnduff the winner.;    The sales rep from Toronto has brown
hair and brown eyes. According to the pageant's program: "She enjoys all
aspects of community theater: directing, choreography and performing, as well
as sports and travel. Rose would like to become Miss Tall International
because the confidence and self-assurance the Tall Clubs have given her should
be shared by all people."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     She is, by the way, 5 feet 11 inches tall.;    Cydney Crampton, the
runner-up, is from San Francisco. The stockbroker is a towering 6 feet 3 1/2
inches tall.;  GOOD VIBES: In its July issue, Details For Men magazine named
Foothill College's radio station, KFJC, as one of the best radio stations in
the country.;    For years, the non-commercial station has spun some of the
hippest, most avant-garde music around. Not having to deal with the bottom
line has prevented 89.7 FM from being another Top-40 clone.;    Details For
Men, in its "rock 'n' roll USA: the essential guide" issue, picks the best
radio stations, nightclubs, music stores and bands in 27 of the nation's
biggest cities. Party on . . .; SAY WHAT?: After months of waiting, Washington
dropped the other shoe and decided that Moffett Field Naval Air Station will
be closed. It inspires us to run this one-liner overheard on the bus by Bill
Tammeus of the Kansas City Star: "If I were in charge of closing military
facilities, I'd probably start with the Pentagon." Just a thought.; CAFE
AMBIENCE: Paris has its cafe society. San Francisco's North Beach has its
espresso junkies. The cafe salon now comes to Palo Alto with an environmental
twist. Bay Area Action, a Palo Alto environmental group, is holding a "BAA
Cafe" the second Thursday of every month. The first one held last month
attracted about 60 people, said Bay Area Action's Peter Drekmeier.;    They
showed up to listen to speeches and music while sipping on cafe latte and
such. The "Cafe" is replacing the group's monthly meeting. Organizers are
trying to find ways to get more people involved, so they thought adding the
entertainment and socializing aspects would help boost the number of
participants.;    This month's schedule includes a talk by Ted Smith, director
of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, on hazardous wastes. "BAA Cafe" will
provide acoustic music by Bob Valdez and Company, food and beverages. The cafe
goes from 7 to 11 p.m. on Thursday, July 11, at 504A Emerson St. There's a $3
donation. Call (415) 321-1994.  </TEXT>
