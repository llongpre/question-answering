   Some residents were happy, others grumpy
about Dopey's rise to the top at the new Walt Disney Co.
headquarters.
   Disney officials on Monday unveiled giant statues of the Seven
Dwarfs, made to look as if they are holding up the roof of the
five-story building.
   Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Dopey, Bashful and Doc each stand
19 feet tall. They'd been kept under wraps for more than three
months.
   Within hours, tourists began stopping to take pictures of the
dwarfs, who starred with Snow White in the 1937 animated classic.
   ``We have Stone Mountain but these are cuter,'' said Diane Ward,
28, a Georgia native who stopped to look with her 12-year-old
nephew as they made their way to visit the NBC Studios.
   Some gazers were a bit puzzled.
   ``How can you call it a dwarf if it's 20 feet tall?'' asked
Randy Garhan, 41, as he sat in the Pago Pago Club across the street.
   Disney employees were enthusiastic.
   ``What other company could do that?'' said Glen Means, 42, who
works in the molding shop. ``I think it's outstanding.''
   Others were less animated by it all.
   ``The Seven Dwarfs seem to be the only ones amused about this
architectural nightmare,'' said Michael Scandiffio, a board member
of the Burbank Rancho Homeowners Association. ``The building is too
massive, it's an overbearing presence on surrounding neighbors.''
