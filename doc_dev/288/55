   A television tower more than twice as tall as
the Eiffel Tower collapsed Thursday, killing two maintenance
workers seeking to strengthen the structure and leaving one
missing, authorities said.
   The 2,000-foot tower was reduced to a ``tangled pile of metal,''
said C.L. Harlan, a Missouri State Highway Patrol dispatcher.
   Workers used torches Thursday afternoon to cut through the
debris in search of the third man.
   ``I don't think there's any hope of anyone who was on that tower
surviving,'' said patrol Sgt. Ron Lenzini.
   The center section of the tower fell with such force that it
went into the ground, he said. ``It's so far down that they have
digging equipment out there.''
   Colony is about 25 miles from the Iowa and Illinois state lines
and 200 miles northwest of St. Louis. The tower belonged to KTVO-TV
in Kirksville.
   The three workers were in a basket-type carrier at the 500-feet
level when the tower collapsed, the patrol said.
   Martha Huber, 15, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the
tower, witnessed the collapse.
   ``I saw the buggy or thing they run up the tower in, and I saw
this coming down and part of the tower with it,'' she said. ``You
couldn't see much because the dust was flying so much. I saw some
of the cables snapping and we called the ambulance right away.''
   Many of the 30 heavy cables that supported the tower snapped
when it collapsed, witnesses said.
   The tower did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area, but
tore down several trees, she said.
   Jerry Heilman, KTVO general manager, said the workers were
replacing more than 1,000 structural braces.
   They were employees of Structural System Technology Inc. of
McLean, Va., and had been working in Colony for several weeks.
   Peter Kizer, president of KTVO's parent company, Federal
Broadcasting of Southfield, Mich., was en route to the scene to
speak with station personnel and the media, Heilman said.
   The tower was erected in September at a cost of $2.5 million and
was one of the tallest transmission towers in the United States,
authorities said. By comparison, the famed Eiffel Tower of Paris is
984 feet tall.
   The tower's unusual height was intended to expand KTVO's viewing
area, said Kurt Sweeney, station news director. It increased the
station's audience from 40,000 households to about 120,000,
officials said.
   ``I heard it (the collapse) and it sounded like a jet taking
off,'' said Elizabeth Huber, Ms. Huber's sister.
   KTVO went off the air about 9:50 a.m. Heilman said the station
could be off the air anywhere from two days to two weeks.
   The tower was the maximum height permitted under Federal
Aviation Administration rules, said Sharon Scott, public service
specialist for the Federal Communications Commission in Kansas City.
