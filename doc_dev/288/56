   The physiques of flight attendants won't be on the pre-flight checklist anymore at Pan American World Airways. 

   "We had to do pirouettes in front of supervisors, frequently males, so they could inspect our chins, legs and ankles," says Margaret Brennan, president of the Independent Union of Flight Attendants. 
"It was a nightmare." 

   But New York-based Pan Am Corp. agreed yesterday to end its periodic appearance inspections of flight attendants to settle a discrimination lawsuit pending in the federal appeals court in San Francisco. 
A federal district court judge ruled in 1987 that Pan Am was discriminating against flight attendants by being too strict on how much it allows them to weigh. 

   The settlement loosens the belt on the weight policy, ends the appearance checks and obligates Pan Am to pay as much as $2.8 million to flight attendants who have been fired or suspended because of their weight. 
The payment includes $400,000 in legal fees for the 5,100 member union. 

   No more will Pan Am flight attendants have to suffer the checklist's dreaded category of "disproportionate weight or flabbiness." 
The list also included: Thighs/Hips; Chin; Figure/Physique; and Legs/Ankles. 

   Although male flight attendants were inspected too, "for them, ankles and legs didn't matter," insists Ms. Brennan. 
She said women were required to wear skirts for the inspections. 

   But Pan Am's male attendants can also ease up on their stationary bikes as a result of the settlement. 
For example, a male six feet tall who's categorized as having a small frame may now tip the scales at 180 pounds, compared with 162 under the old rules. 
A six-foot-tall female Pan Am attendant in the small/medium frame category may now weigh 172 pounds, compared with 156 previously. 
The weights are measured with the attendants in uniform, without jackets or shoes. 

   The Pan Am agreement may help settle another battle of bulge being fought by American Airlines with its 16,000 member flight attendants union in Fort Worth, Texas, federal court. 
The flight attendants at the AMR Corp. unit want their airline's weight standards liberalized. 
For example, a five-foot, five-inch tall American female attendant can weigh no more than 120 pounds, a union spokeswoman said. 
At Pan Am, under the new agreement, the same size woman could weigh 151 pounds. 

   But an American spokeswoman sniffed that her company's standards "are part of our general appearance policy." 
Flight attendants argue that pilots, who don't have weight restrictions at American or at most airlines, are on public view before and after flights. 
"They just want the flight attendants slim and trim to fit a stereotype," says Kathy King, an attorney representing both the American and Pan Am flight attendants. 

   The Pan Am attendants union's Ms. Brennan says that letting attendants be bigger is "a teeny-weeny step away from sexual stereotypes, and that's good."
