   Mount McKinley still is North America's
tallest mountain, but it is not as tall as people have been saying
for years.
   Using extremely sensitive gravity meters and satellites,
scientists from the University of Alaska-Anchorage have determined
the mountain is 20,306 feet high.
   That's 14 feet less than what Bradford Washburn calculated in
1954. But it still is 456 feet taller than the runner-up, Mount
Logan in Canada.
   ``I wish it had gone up 14 feet,'' said Jeff Yates, assistant
coordinator of the project. ``It's kind of an intangible thing from
a climber's standpoint. People just like the bigger mountains.''
   A few more measurements might vary the new measurement slightly,
but not more than a foot, Yates said.
   The scientists say that because of its great mass, McKinley
exerts enough gravitational pull to distort standard surveying
techniques like those used by Washburn to calculate the mountain's
height.
