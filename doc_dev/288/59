PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who runs Panama has an office in the Presidential Palace and roars 
through town in a bulletproof limousine accompanied by armored cars full of 
large, heavily armed bodyguards who wear ominous dark glasses. 
</P>
<P>
He decides who can walk free and who goes to jail, when citizens can be on the 
street and when they have to be in their houses, and even what avenues are open 
to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
This man is not President Guillermo Endara, nor is he the popular, charismatic 
2nd Vice President Guillermo (Billy) Ford, nor the intellectual 1st Vice 
President Ricardo Arias Calderon. He isn't even a Panamanian. 
</P>
<P>
And if you thought, well, it must be the American ambassador, you would be 
wrong. The man who runs Panama is a middle-aged career diplomat who has never 
reached the rank of ambassador -- in fact, he's never held a post higher than 
that of the No. 2 diplomat in the American Embassy in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
He is a tall, stooped American with thinning hair and a desire not to be 
identified in public. His name is John Bushnell -- and he is the closest thing 
the United States has to a proconsul. 
</P>
<P>
While Endara, a once-obscure lawyer with no political following, is enjoying 
the public trappings of office -- a Mercedes-Benz limousine, a tricolored 
presidential sash and bowing and scraping aides, Bushnell wears a simple, white 
sport shirt and nondescript slacks. 
</P>
<P>
The only things that set him apart from the crowd are his security guards and a 
white bulletproof vest that he wears outside his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the new Panamanian government was temporarily located in the Foreign 
Ministry, the two vice presidents had their offices in cramped quarters on the 
first floor -- while Bushnell was ensconced next to Endara in comfortable rooms 
on the second floor. He even lives in the same building where Endara, Ford and 
Arias live near the American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
If Bushnell appears unassuming and his title is nothing more than U.S. deputy 
chief of mission, the people in the know here know who to talk to when things 
need to be done. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. troops stepped over the bounds of international law and violated the 
diplomatic sanctity of the Nicaraguan ambassador by raiding his official 
residence, it was Bushnell who was called and who fixed things. 
</P>
<P>
And when American troops were trying to unnerve ousted dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega by playing loud rock music outside his hiding place in the Vatican 
embassy, it was Bushnell who ordered the broadcasts toned down after the 
Vatican's emissary complained that he couldn't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell is reported to have approved sending American troops to seal the area 
around the Peruvian Embassy because of reports that Noriega might seek asylum 
there, and he was the one the Peruvian ambassador complained to. 
</P>
<P>
"No diplomat calls (U.S.) Ambassador (Arthur) Davis; he doesn't count," said a 
European envoy about Davis -- the almost invisible political appointee who is 
mocked by some associates as Elmer Fudd because he has a slight speech 
impediment. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Bushnell has signed off on curfew hours set for this capital 
city and makes the final decisions on which former Noriega officials and 
cronies are arrested. And, says a senior embassy official who asked not to be 
identified, until the Panamanian government is capable of assuming police and 
security functions, "the embassy is in operational control" of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
That means, says a different official, John Bushnell. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell's role is not the only unusual aspect of life in Panama in the wake of 
the Dec. 20 American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that invasion has been a massive influx of reporters and broadcast 
technicians. At one point, the figure reached nearly 500, many of whom had 
never covered a military operation nor been near danger. 
</P>
<P>
The number of journalists quickly overwhelmed the American military's capacity 
to deal with them. To pare down the total to something manageable, the U.S. 
Southern Command took an imaginative approach that showed more originality than 
some of its battle tactics. 
</P>
<P>
First, the military made life very uncomfortable -- preventing reporters from 
leaving U.S. bases but not providing places to sleep, adequate facilities for 
filing their dispatches or sufficient food. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the soldiers turned to scare tactics. After describing how his car had 
been shot at near the American Embassy and saying that "it is war out there," 
Col. Ronald Sconyers, the Southern Command's spokesman, said a charter flight 
had been arranged to take anyone to Miami who wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 125 of the 300 journalists in the room immediately signed on for the 
trip, even though none had been outside of the American-run Howard Air Base 
here or had been in Panama for more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Noriega has been thoroughly discredited -- and even the former 
dictator's most loyal supporters now sport Endara T-shirts -- some signs of the 
former regime remain. 
</P>
<P>
Standing 20 feet tall on Via Espana, one of Panama City's busiest streets, is a 
huge poster, unblemished by graffiti, pronouncing "Carlos Duque, President." 
</P>
<P>
Duque was Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate who was embarrassingly 
trounced in last May's vote. Noriega ultimately annulled the results. Duque is 
being sought by the U.S. military.
