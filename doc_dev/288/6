<LEADPARA>  Roberta and Michael Mueller's wedding was big -- really big.;    In fact, it
was so big that the average height of a person in San Francisco grew by a few
inches during their ceremony Wednesday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     About 100 members from the Tall Club International Convention -- women at
least 5-foot-10 and men at least 6-foot-2 -- attended the ceremony.;    In a
short ceremony under foggy San Francisco skies, Roberta and Michael exchanged
nuptials, eye-to-eye. It was one of the few times either of them has had a
relationship with someone of comparable height.;    "It's nice to be in a
crowd of tall people and be normal. I feel petite here," said Roberta Mueller,
the 6-foot-1 Ms. Tall International 1990.;    The 20 contestants from the 1991
contest were her attendants.;    "I've gone from one extreme to the other,"
said Michael Mueller, whose first wife of eight years was 5 feet tall.;    The
happy occasion was just part of the weeklong Tall Clubs International 44th
Annual Convention that drew more than 300 people from around the nation,
Canada and Europe.  </TEXT>
