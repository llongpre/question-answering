   Fighting heat, smoke and flames at dizzying heights like Los
Angeles' 62-story First International Bank building can turn
firefighters into high-rise commandos facing special dangers and
physical punishment.
   ``It's like fighting a bungalow fire 200 feet in the air,'' said
Jerry Lawrence of the Chicago Fire Department, which protects the
1,454-foot tall Sears Tower, the tallest building in the country
and among the most fireproof.
   Skyscraper fires are physically exhausting to put out, with
firefighters huffing up stairs with 50 pounds of equipment and air
tanks on their backs. Reserves are called up often for relief and
to replenish air supplies.
   ``It's a very hazardous, punishing type of fire,'' said Roger
Lanaham of the U.S. Fire Administration in the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. ``You have to have shock troops. It's like a
tough football game. You have to keep bringing in fresh blood.''
   People trapped above the fire must be evacuated, sometimes by
helicopter but preferably down stairwells. And precautions must be
taken to keep those on the street from being showered with
heat-shattered glass.
   Aerial ladders and cranes reach no higher than 10 floors, so
firefighters work the fire from the inside, setting up a staging
area on a floor below the fire. They bring hoses, equipment, first
aid and compressed air. Oxygen is never carried because it can
ignite.
   ``It's a manual operation that takes more personnel than any
other fire. It's also an inside fire. They can't put the fire out
from the outside. That's what makes it so dangerous,'' said Joseph
Redden, spokesman for the National Fire Protection Association in
Quincy, Mass., a former Newark, N.J. fire chief.
   High-rise fires create a chimney effect, sucking heat and smoke
up stairwells and elevator shafts to the top of the building.
Firefighters open bulkheads or smash holes in the roof to prevent
explosive buildups.
   In the 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas, Nev., 74 of the
87 deaths came from smoke inhalation, according to fire officials.
Most victims were found trapped on the top seven floors of the
26-story building.
   Another fire that prompted improved designs and sprinkler
systems was a 1986 blaze that killed 97 people, including 84 on a
first floor casino, at the DuPont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Three hotel workers pleaded guilty to setting the fire.
   ``In a fire, smoke is usually a killer, not the flames,'' said
John Mulligan, spokesman for the New York City Fire Department. ``A
high-rise fire is going to be hot and smoky and among the most
difficult firefighting conditions.''
   New York has 1,200 high-rises or buildings that are more than 75
feet tall. The city averages one fire per day in a high-rise,
although most are in lower floors and are easily contained,
Mulligan said.
   Firefighters say real life bears little resemblance to the
Hollywood hokum of the movie ``The Towering Inferno,'' in which
most of the stars scrambled to the roof to await rescue.
   ``You never want to get above the fire,'' Redden said. ``That's
the worst place you can be.''
