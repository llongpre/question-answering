<LEADPARA>  Buddhist monks won an apparent victory Wednesday in a dispute about the
construction of a 16-story hotel in the heart of Kyoto when the hotel operator
said he will revise plans for the building.;   The monks had fiercely opposed
the 198-foot height of the proposed new Kyoto Hotel and threatened to launch a
campaign to bar tourists staying at hotels operated by the Kyoto Hotel group
from entering some of the city's most famous temples.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUDDHIST MONKS WIN DISPUTE ABOUT HEIGHT OF JAPANESE
HOTEL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The monks and other civic groups have argued that the building, which would
have been the tallest in the city, would block the scenic view of surrounding
hills and temples.;   "We thought we would invite antipathy if we only stick
to the height," Kyoto Hotel President Masashi Takahashi said. "A hotel here is
of merit if it is enjoyed, fraternized and loved by people in Kyoto.";  
Takahashi did not indicate, however, how tall the hotel will be built now that
he has decided to change his plans.;   In a joint news conference with
Takahashi, Raitei Arima, chief director of the Kyoto Buddhist Association,
which led the boycott, praised the decision.;   "We express the greatest
respect for the decision, which came with much sacrifice," Arima said.  </TEXT>
