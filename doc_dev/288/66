<LEADPARA>  It appears that Lisa Fox ("Maybe it's time for the U.S. to lock its doors,"
Letters, Aug. 26) is out of touch with reality and is unaware of the
contributions of immigrants to this nation.;   Look at any U.S. university: 60
percent of the doctorates in science and engineering go to foreign-born
nationals. Many successful companies like Sun Microsystems, LSI Logic, Cirrus
Logic, etc., were started by immigrants. And 40 percent of the research and
development staff at IBM (Yorktown Heights), Texas Instruments, AT&amp;T, National
Semiconductor and LSI Logic consists of immigrants!  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     -- U.S. Brahme; Milpitas; POSTERS 'TOO SEXY' BUT BUS ADS AREN'T?; Earlier
this month, Gannett Outdoor Co. and Santa Clara County Transportation Agency
deemed two posters (a picture of a man eating a banana and another of a man
and woman kissing with their hair turning into wolves) unfit for display. They
were "too graphic, too sexual," according to Jim Oneal of Gannett (Mercury
News, Aug. 7).;   After seeing the pictures, I didn't agree with the decision
but thought that Gannett and County Transit must have strict moral standards.
So I was surprised today when I passed a transit bus displaying a Mervyn's ad
with a picture of a woman in a little black dress, reclining between two men;
one had removed one of her shoes and the other was biting her shoulder.;   Why
is it "too graphic, too sexual" for a man to bite a banana but not to bite a
woman? Is it wrong to show a man and woman in a sensual pose on equal terms
but OK if the woman is submissive? Do Gannett and County Transit have two sets
of standards -- one for paying companies such as Mervyn's and another for
space that is donated to groups like the San Jose Museum of Art?;   There is a
place for sensual and sexual art, and I agree that the side of a bus is not
the most appropriate place to display it. But whose mores determine what is
right and wrong? The people of Santa Clara County deserve some answers.;   --
Cheri Simonsen; Morgan Hill; FREE MARKET IS OK, BUT NOT FREE TRADE; In
"America's cold wall" (Editorials, Aug. 16), concerning our border with Mexico
and the building of a wall to keep drug traffickers out of this country, you
seem to think it is this country's continued duty to provide for the people of
the world.;   I realize this country was instituted to help the oppressed and
the persecuted, but it has become a haven for the poor. We have enough poor
and oppressed people in this country without having to service the world.;  
As far as pumping up the economy of Mexico, or any other country, I believe in
free market not a free ride. It is good to help other countries, other
peoples, but I really do believe in helping ourselves to be strong and free.; 
 -- Greg Gianelli; Los Gatos; Felling 70-foot trees; isn't 'improvement'; Not
that the area of Highway 101 at First Street was ever a beautiful spot, but
the deforestation inflicted by the current "improvement" project is horrific!
The cutting of 70-foot-tall trees that have survived the highway pollutants
forces me to protest: Is this improvement?;   With our California drought, how
many years will pass before tall trees again grace our major artery?;   --
