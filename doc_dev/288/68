   With the burden of a sheep thrown over his
shoulder, a sculpture of a Basque shepherder stands against the
solitude of a grassy knoll in western Nevada.
   ``A figure as if sculpted by the wind itself,'' says an
inscription on a concrete incline leading to the 22-foot-tall, 5-ton
abstract bronze sculpture. ``A man solitary and strong, held
straight by his own will, patient laborer facing onto the uncertain
horizon of adventure.''
   The sculpture, scheduled to be dedicated Sunday, culminates a
four-year, $350,000 effort by Basques in America, France and Spain
to erect a U.S. monument to thousands of their countrymen who began
coming here during the 1850s gold rush to roam the mountains,
keeping watch over sheep.
   For 100 years, an estimated 95 percent of all shepherds in the
West were Basques who had come to the U.S. with a few dollars and
worked to amass their own herds, eventually owning the largest sheep
ranches in the United States.
   ``We felt if we didn't do something to honor our heritage, what
brought us all here to this country, we would be lost in the melting
pot of America,'' explained Janet Inda of Reno, secretary-treasurer
of the national Basque Club.
   Basque sculptor and noted artist Nestor Basterretxea said he
wanted the monument named ``Solitude'' to capture the loneliness of
the shepherd's life.
   ``I wanted it to look as though it was a stone carved from the
wind,'' he said Thursday through an interpreter as the huge
sculpture was erected. ``I wanted the shepherder to be part of the
elements.''
   Gene Sullivan, director of the Washoe County Parks Department,
said the Rancho San Rafael Park knoll was specifically selected as
the site of the only monument to Basque shepherders in America
because it used to be a sheep ranch.
   ``There just couldn't be a better place for this,'' Sullivan
said. ``It's a typical sheep grazing area.''
   The Reno site also was selected because it is the geographic
center of the largest population of Basques in the United States.
About 90 percent of U.S. Basques live in Nevada, California or
Idaho, according to Mrs. Inga.
   About 75,000 to 100,000 Americans have Basque ancestry. Basques
hail from the Pyrenees Mountains along the border between France and
Spain.
   Foreign dignitaries, including 70 Basque nationals, have traveled
to Reno for the dedication Sunday morning. The event coincides with
the city's annual Basque Festival, which begins today.
   The bronze sculpture was cast in Mexico City and almost didn't
make it out of Mexico because of red tape.
   But prominent Nevada Basques helped cut the red tape, including
author Robert Laxalt, whose brother Paul is a former U.S. senator.
   ``It was held up by the Mexican Ministry of Fine Art,'' said
Laxalt, adding he used White House contacts to help get it out of
the country earlier this week. The Ministry of Fine Art released the
sculpture after authorities were assured it wasn't a Mexican
national treasure.
   ``This has been a four-year effort to memorialize the only
forgotten stereotype in the building of the early West,'' Laxalt
said. ``You have the Pony Express riders, the miners and the
cowboys, but the shepherders always were low profile and lived in
solitude.''
