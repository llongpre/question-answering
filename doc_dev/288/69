Glenn Close insists she fits the part of a prairie woman in the Hallmark Hall 
of Fame production, "Sarah, Plain and Tall." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to be tall," the 5-foot-4 actress said, raising her skirt just 
enough to expose her elevated boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've added four inches to my height." 
</P>
<P>
As for plain, she said: "I'm a New Englander and I think of New Englanders as 
being plain-spoken and unadorned and that kind of thing. There are different 
interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
Close was in this small southeastern Kansas town to film part of the production 
scheduled for airing on CBS early next year. Filming in Kansas concluded 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
She plays Sarah Wheaton, a Maine woman who answers a newspaper ad from a newly 
widowed prairie farmer in 1910. Christopher Walken plays Jacob Witting, the 
lonely farmer seeking a mother for his two young children. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is based on Patricia MacLachlan's 1985 book that won the Newberry 
Medal for outstanding children's literature.
