And Lifts Won't Guarantee a Raise

   For everyone who has ever suspected that getting ahead in business is not just a matter of whom you know, now there's proof. 

   A University of Pittsburgh study involving nearly 1,500 graduates of its MBA program found that taller businessmen earn more annually -- typically, $600 an inch more -- than their shorter counterparts. 
For example, a six-foot male professional will make an average $3,600 more a year than his 5'6" colleague, according to the study. 
The taller a man is, the researchers say, the more he appears assertive and dominant, attributes likely to aid his corporate climb. 

   However, the sky isn't the limit. 
"Beyond 6'3" or so, you start to look like a freak," says Josephine Olson, the associate professor of business administration at Pitt who conducted the study. 
The optimum height for a fast-tracker? 
Anywhere between 5'10" and 6'2". 

   Nor is size a good thing in all dimensions. 
Being overweight (defined as at least 20% heavier than the norms on standard height-weight charts) tends to squeeze an average $4,000 a year from a paycheck, the Pitt study indicates. 

   That doesn't shock Gerald Lamb, an official of the National Association to Aid Fat Americans. 
"We have discrimination everywhere else, so this just isn't a big surprise," he notes. 
"Perhaps the big surprise is that we're doing that well." 

   Why the disparities? 
"Hiring authorities are, after all, human," says Alan Schonberg, president of Cleveland-based Management Recruiters International Inc., an executive-search concern. 
"A tall, dark, handsome MBA will win over a short, fat MBA." 

   He says that an obese person is usually perceived as lacking self-control and willpower. 
As for short men, "that's just plain prejudice," contends the "5-foot-7-and-a-half-inch" Mr. Schonberg. 
"A lot of us shrink carrying the burden of making it," he adds. 

   The study's findings apply only to men, the Pitt researchers say. 
There weren't many overweight women in the group, and what tall women there were didn't seem to earn more than shorter ones. 

   One reason, theorizes Irene Frieze, a psychology professor who also worked on the study, is that "men don't like to look up to women. 
In a way, it's threatening to them." 
Still, Ms. Frieze isn't fretting that tall women don't earn more. 
She herself is 5'3".
