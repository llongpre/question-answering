<LEADPARA>  From our spies in Washington:;    Another theory from Washington magazine is
that the taller candidate always wins the presidency. Look, say the editors,
at Eisenhower vs. Stevenson, LBJ vs. Goldwater, Reagan vs. Carter and Bush (or
almost anyone) vs. Dukakis.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This, they reason, leaves the Democrats trying to measure up to a 6-foot-2
George Bush with a 5-foot-9 1/2 Paul Tsongas. Or possibly with Mario Cuomo (he
claims to be 6 feet tall but no one believes him).;    Running through the
list of other possibilities the magazine finds only two, Jay Rockefeller and
Bill Bradley (both 6-foot-6), who can look down on the GOP incumbent.;    Any
other Democratic contender would have to run on issues alone . . . and we all
know how far that'll take them.; (hbox);    Nancy Reagan's former hairdresser,
Robin Weir, and former press secretary, Elaine Crispen, are arranging a book
bash for George Carpozi Jr., and his "Poison Pen: The Unauthorized Biography
of Kitty Kelley" (Barricade Books).;    They're inviting all Kelley's victims
to the Aug. 12 affair, especially Frank Sinatra, Jackie Onassis, Elizabeth
Taylor and Mrs. Reagan, though they don't really expect them to attend.  </TEXT>
