   A New York real estate firm on
Monday announced plans to erect Europe's tallest building _ a
53-story, 838-foot office tower _ on sprawling fairgrounds in this
West German city.
   Tishman Speyer Properties said the project, which it valued at
$375 million, will be financed by Citibank.
   The skyscraper, with its 920,000 square feet of office space,
will surpass the Palac Kultury of Warsaw, Poland, as Europe's
tallest building. The Palac Kultury, has 42 stories and is 790 feet
tall.
   Frankfurt Mayor Wolfram Brueck said the building is expected to
be completed by 1991.
   Tishman Speyer President Jerry Speyer, appearing at a press
conference with the mayor, said his company already has received
rental inquiries about the building.
   Frankfurt, West Germany's flourishing banking and finance
center, has been expanding in recent years. New office buildings
have sprouted up in the city's center, and decaying downtown
neighborhoods have been renovated.
   The fairgrounds are not far from the city's downtown shopping
area, its main train station and banking district.
   Tishman Speyer manages a portfolio of properties valued at $4
billion, the company said in a statement. The company currently has
$1 billion worth of projects under development, including the
Beijing American Express Center, an office and apartment complex in
China.
