   Los Angeles Times on Panama:
   Bush Administration officials seem to take criticism of their
performance during the failed Panamanian coup as a challenge to
prove they are not wimps. But they must not lose sight of what is
really at stake in Panama. ...
   President Bush repeated at a Friday press conference his desire
to see Noriega ousted. Insisting that he did not mean to imply
``carte blanche support'' to a future coup attempt, the president
added, ``I wouldn't mind force if it could be done in a prudent
manner.''
   Apart from being unclear, the statement was unwise. ...
   But with the widespread opposition of his own people, Noriega
will fall in time. Until then, the only way he can survive
politically is to pose as a nationalist standing up to Yanqui
intervention.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Panama:
   The group of military officers who moved against Gen. Noriega
did not openly ask for help from the United States. Although the
coup leaders wanted covert assistance, they viewed overt U.S.
intervention as embarrassing and damaging.
   They wanted to give the impression, at least, that the coup was
the work of patriotic Panamanians, not of a cadre of officers
carrying out orders from Washington.
   The question that members of Congress should be asking
themselves is whether the American people want military
intervention in Panama. So far the polls indicate that a majority
of Americans approve President Bush's policy of patience and
prudence.

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on Mideast peace talks:
   The Israeli-Palestinian peace process is, as usual, stalled, but
this time a clear call has gone out for American help in getting it
back in motion.
   It's time for another Cape David effort.
   That term refers to American help, led by former president Jimmy
Carter at the presidential retreat, which produced a peace treaty
between Israel and Egypt.
   Now, Egypt is trying to return the favor by playing the role of
midwife to another potential agreement, negotiating with both sides
in hopes of getting Israel and the Palestinians talking directly.
...
   In apparent response, Secretary of State James Baker has called
for a three-way meeting in Washington between U.S., Egyptian and
Israeli representatives to work on a formula for getting talks
going. It's none too soon.

   The Reporter, Fond du Lac, Wis. on the census:
   We think the U.S. House of Representatives was dead wrong ... in
its vote to count foreign citizens who are in this country
illegally as part of the 1990 census. ...
   Southern and western states with large populations of illegal
aliens will gain congressional representation at the expense of
those states which do not attract them. ...
   Legally, those aliens cannot be considered part of the political
community. They cannot vote for members of Congress but do dilute
the representation given to U.S. citizens. ...
   Congress should be encouraged by the American people to
reconsider.

   The Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va, on Jim Bakker:
   Even after a jury convicted TV evangelist Jim Bakker of 24
counts of fraud and conspiracy, the faith of many of his followers
remained unshaken.
   One of his flock, a major donor to Bakker's PTL ministry, was
asked if she wanted her money back. She replied: ``No, I didn't
give my money to Jim Bakker. I gave it to the Lord.''
   The Bakker trial shows that a few housand suckers are born every
minute, eager to become the victims of smooth-talkers who claim the
Lord handed them a collection plate.
   If citizens need government protection from phony and dangerous
medicines, from tainted beef, from chemicals that poison our air
and water, heaven knows they need protection from the con men who _
like Jim Bakker _ take their money to build air-conditioned dog
houses and buy fleets of Rolls-Royces.

   Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Times Leader on reported UFOs in the Soviet
Union:
   (The Soviet news agency) Tass' yarn about a UFO sighting 300
miles southeast of Moscow was interesting _ hoax or not.
   For one thing, the Soviet Union's visiting space creatures
(described as being nine to 12 feet tall and resembling humans, but
with very small heads and three eyes) seem different from those
routinely seen here in America (tall, spindly-legged, ugly
creatures with triangular heads, two eyes, and initials for names,
a la ``E.T.'').
   For another, theirs landed in a park during daylight, while ours
usually land at night near a seldom-traveled road that runs along a
cornfield in Iowa.
   The Soviet sighting is interesting for yet another reason: This
is apparently a first in that country _ which as recently as 10
years ago used to label our UFO sightings as a capitalist trick or
device.
   See, Ivan, we told you so!
