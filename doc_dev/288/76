<TEXT>     "If it's in bloom, people are buying it," says Kay  Kawashima of Sunshine
Nursery in San Jose. Sales of both bedding annuals and perennials are up, he
says, "People are replacing things, filling in bare spots. Color is
everything.";    Perennials are very much in the floral spotlight, he says.
But right up there, standing flower head to flower head, are the annuals for
those who crave bold red, orange and yellow blooms. Bulbs, including the
summer-blooming gladioluses and daylilies, have their place, too.;    There is
no wrong way to use these flowers. You can toss them together like a Ceasar
salad for a wild riot of color. Or, you can line them up like Stormin'
Norman's troops for a frankly formal English garden. Regardless, if you do it
right with some planning and planting now, you can have non-stop flowers
through fall.;    In most cases it's too late to start summer bloomers from
seed, but nurseries are awash with flowers in six-packs and 4-inch pots. They
will begin to bloom by mid-June.;    A caveat: You can't skimp on the water
and expect to have great flowers. They need a steady supply of water from
planting through bloom time. So, make your choices carefully and plant flowers
where you're get the best visual effects.;    "Location is everything," the
realty agents say. So it is with flowers. The trick to growing great ones is
putting the right plant in the right place. Toward this end, know the sun
lovers from the shade dwellers. Marigolds, zinnias, petunias and China asters
are among the flowers that need at least six hours of sunlight to grow well.
For shade, plant impatiens, bedding begonias and coleus, which is grown for
its colorful foliage.;    Choose flowers for both their color and for their
foliage. And, for the longest possible show, plant varieties that bloom in
succession.;     Some flowers fit any need, doing their thing long after
others have given up. Alyssum, for instance, is a good bet for any growing
condition. Marigolds, petunias, geraniums, annual coreopsis and ground covers
such as gazania are other workhorses in the garden. Lavender statice  and
yarrow do double duty coming indoors as dried flowers when the garden season
ends. Don't overlook the California natives: Some are drought tolerant and
flower beautifully.;    Here are some tips:;     (box) SHAPING UP: Before you
go shopping for your first petunia, figure out the garden design. This doesn't
mean you have to consult a landscape designer, but you do need to figure some
kind of plot.;    "The old, rigidly formal styles have given way to looser,
more free-flowing designs," writes Anne Moyer Halpin in "The Year-Round Flower
Gardener" (Summit Books, $16.95). "Borders today curve gracefully and the
flowers are planted in flowing drifts instead of straight lines. Island beds
are carved out of lawns and usually take a circular, elliptical, or even
irregular shape.";    To experiment with the shape of a flower-bed-to-be,
Halpin says, lay out a garden hose in the shape you are considering in the
area where the garden will be. Don't like a round circle? Well, just move the
hose around and adjust the shape until you find the outline you like in the
spot you like best.;     (box) THE GROUPIES: Perennials, bulbs and flowers
that reseed themselves such as California poppies are the backbone of an
all-season garden because they come back year after year. But like fashion
accessories, annuals add pizazz to an plain yard.;    How? Well, you can find
all kinds of advice in garden books about monochromatic plantings and
contrasting color schemes and planting for depth or focus. But don't be misled
by this well-meaning advice. If you like it, plant it.;    If you must have a
color plan, keep this in mind: blues, purples and dark colors fade in the
distance for a mellow effect. White accents stand out. Bright colors including
red, yellow and pink light up dark corners and bring them into focus.;   
(box) ONE SIZE FITS ALL: To create the most desirable views with flowers, take
into account the height of the mature plants and the length of the blooming
season. With the right combinations, one season will merge gently with the
next sans the ugly bare spots that shout to the world, "Opps, I forgot to
plant something here.";     Here is a guide to help you get growing:;   
(check) ZINNIAS -- These are the backbone of the Santa Clara Valley summer
garden. They are incredibly easy to grow, flourishing in any soil, with blooms
that last through the hottest part of summer. They come in all colors except
blue. Because they come in many sizes and shades, they can be used as borders,
beds and edging.;    Height: From 12-36 inches, depending on variety. They
like the hot, sunny weather, poor soil and regular watering. Water by soaking,
not sprinkling, because they are subject to powdery mildew when foliage
becomes wet.;    (check) ALYSSUM -- This is a good bet for edging or drifts in
a formal bed. It is extremely hardy, tolerates both hot and cold weather, and
is fairly drought tolerant.;    Height: About 3 inches. Alyssum is a compact
plant smothered with either white, pink or purplish flowers. It takes full
sun, light watering.;    (check) CHINA ASTER -- Flowers are spectacular in
shades from white to azure blue. This is the annual aster; the "other" aster
is a perennial version also known as the Michaelmas daisy. China asters have
big, frilly flowers that are long-lasting as cut flowers.;    Height: From 1-3
feet. Use low-growing kinds as edging plants, taller ones for cutting. Asters
like full sun and rich soil, and can be started from seed directly in the
garden. They're subject to a variety of diseases, most of which are the result
of overwatering, which shouldn't be a problem this year.;    (check) COSMOS --
This showy, long-lasting flower grows rapidly and attracts birds. It comes in
white and in a number of bright, clear colors -- the pink range is from
magenta to pink to lavender -- all with yellow centers.;    Height: From 2-8
feet. Use as background planting. Plant in full sun; it's drought resistant.; 
  (check) DELPHINIUM -- Some gardeners think delphiniums come only in blue,
but the color range includes pink shades, pure white and lavender. The huge,
showy spikes are filled with closely spaced florets. Giant Pacific types are
the best bets.;    Height: From 2 feet for dwarfs to 5 feet for Giant Pacific.
Use tall ones for background planting, low-growing types for borders. They
like full sun. Plants need staking, regular watering.;    (check) DIANTHUS --
Carnations, pinks, sweet Williams are naturals for a scented garden, but they
require extra care with staking to get nice garden flowers. Pinks are shorter
and have smaller flowers than carnations, and almost all come in pink or
pink-white combinations. Sweet Williams come in many pink-blue-white
combinations.;    Height: From 3 inches (Wee Willie) to 3 feet (tall-growing
carnations). They require sun, rich soil and even watering for a long blooming
season. Carnations and sweet William are subject to rust and fusarium wilt.
Carnations require staking.;    (check) GERANIUMS -- The common geranium, the
showy Martha Washington types and the ivy (trailing) geraniums all come in
brilliant range of colors. They can be used as bedding, borders and shrubs,
and can be grown upright in pots or cascading over in baskets. A good many
garden geraniums died in the December freeze, but there's a good selection
available in 4-inch pots at garden ceneters.;    Height: To 30 inches.
Geraniums don't mind a little neglect. Let soil dry to about 1 inch deep, then
water thoroughly. Growing tips need to be pinched to shape the plants, and
dead flowers picked off. Problems with whitefly, aphids and budworms are
common.;    (check) HOLLYHOCK -- Tall-growing, hardy hollyhock has
saucer-shaped flowers, mostly pink to rose shades on towering flower spikes.
Use as the backup accent to low-growing flowers.;    Height: To 9 feet. Some
shorter varieties grow to only 2 feet tall. Hollyhock is a sun-lover, but
needs regular watering. Watch for rust on the leaves. They'll need staking,
but are worth the extra effort, since they will reseed themselves and come
back next year.;    (check) IMPATIENS -- This is the top-selling bedding plant
in the Bay Area, with a long bloom season in shady areas. Tiny flowers are in
the pink-lavender-red range, as well as white. Interesting foliage is a
bonus.;    Height: From 8 inches to 3 feet, depending on variety. Impatiens
take either light sun or shade. Use in beds, borders, background and hanging
baskets. Don't skimp on the water.;    (check) LAVENDER -- Valued for fragrant
lavender or purple flowers, lavender has the bonus of good-looking gray or
grayish-green foliage. English lavender is the type most widely used, with
long scented spikes in July and August.;    Height: From 3-4 feet. Plant in
full sun, but go easy on water because lavender is fairly drought tolerant.
Plants need to be pruned after bloom to retain compact size.;    (check)
MARIGOLD -- There is a fantastic selection of marigolds, from the dwarfs to
the 36-inch-tall giants. When all other summer annuals are finished blooming,
the marigolds will still be hanging on well into November. The color range is
from creamy white to shades of yellow, gold and orange, some with bronze-gold
edges. New varieties show up every year, but you can't beat the Janie and Inca
varieties.;    Height: From 7 inches to 3 feet. Marigolds take full sun and
don't mind poor soil. You must keep the spent flowers trimmed off for
long-lasting blooming cycle. Tall ones require staking.;    (check) NASTURTIUM
-- "Be nasty to nasturtiums" is an old garden saying. But the advice is good
because kindness in the form of frequent watering and feeding produces lots of
leaves and no flowers. Therefore, it's a good plant for lazy gardeners. The
colors are white, golden yellow, scarlet and deep red, with the yellows and
reds most commonly available. They are an excellent cut flower and also are
edible -- the tiny flowers taste like watercress.;    Height: From
12-inch-tall dwarf type to climbers that reach 10 feet high. They prefer sun
at least part of the day, poor soil, and little water.;    (check) PETUNIAS --
For showy little flowers in the white-pink-lavender color range, petunias have
no match. They are best used in borders, mass plantings and containers. They
rank with marigolds and zinnias as sun-loving garden favorites, in endless
sizes and flower forms that seem to bloom endlessly.;    Height: From 6-24
inches, depending on variety and whether they are pinched back. Prune the
fading flowers to produce a second bloom. They prefer a great deal of sun and
water, and will flower through the hottest part of summer.;  GARDEN DESIGN
TIPS; (box) Plant drifts of color, not single plants, and let the colors melt
into one another.;    (box) Have a gradation of heights, front to back, but
let a few plants drift in and out of their group for a softer, more integrated
look.;    (box) Use a variety of plant forms and flower shapes: round,
clustered flowers, flat daisylike flowers, trumpet shaped flowers, tall spires
and spikes, branching flowers.;    (box) Plant for a succession of bloom.;   
(box) Keep the plantings in scale with the site.;    (box) Plan the flower
garden to have some flowers blooming when trees and shrubs in the surrounding
landscape are flowering.;    (box) Start small and simple.;    (box) Don't be
afraid to change next year what you don't like this year.;    (box) Follow
your instincts.;    (box) Include a bench or chairs in your garden so you can
sit and enjoy the flowers.;    -- Anne Moyer Halpin; "The Year-Round Flower
