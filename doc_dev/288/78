<LEADPARA>  Like the Charles Atlas ads in the back of old comic books, Kevin Nanney often
found himself defenseless against bigger and stronger players when it came to
basketball.;    Unlike the 98-pound weakling in those old strips, though,
Nanney was 6 feet, 8 inches tall. Sympathy, likely, wasn't going to be on his
side. Embarrassment was more likely.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the ad, the weakling transformed into a bodybuilder through hard work.
Nanney followed the example.;    "I used to get pushed around quite a bit when
I was a sophomore," said Nanney, who hopes to round out at 6-9 and 230 pounds
eventually. "Last year, it still happened, but nothing like when I was in 10th
grade. This year it hasn't happened at all.";    For Nanney, the time to
retaliate has come. Already, the Mission San Jose senior has agreed to play at
Fresno State next season.;    Joining Nanney as early signees were Kennedy's
Lamond Murray, a 6-7 forward who signed with the University of California,
Berkeley, and Moreau's 6-10 Doug Muse, who will attend UC Santa Barbara.;   
While those three have signed Division I scholarships, the MVAL's tall talent
pool simply begins there. The 1990-'91 season features 22 players, from the
eight schools, who are taller than 6-4. Seven are 6-6 or taller.;    "It seems
every team has a quality big man," said American Coach Dave Garcia. "You never
see that many big men, and to have all of them in one league is amazing. There
should be more slam dunking for the fans. These are guys we'll be watching on
TV in the next few years.";    Nanney, currently 6-8 1/2, has bulked up to 205
pounds from the 175 he weighed as a sophomore. Most of those 30 pounds came
through hard work in the gym during the off season.;    "I'm more proud of the
15 pounds I gained this summer than anything else I've done this year," said
Nanney, who added that he now bench presses 240 pounds. "When I was younger I
couldn't hold my weight. Doctors found out I had low red blood count and that
was causing me to always have colds and not gain weight.";    The difference
in his play has been night and day since he joined the varsity at Mission San
Jose three years ago, his coach said.;    "He's become a lot more assertive
offensively and defensively," said Mission San Jose Coach Pete Vaz. "He's a
lot more self-confident now. When you get beat up a bit, you learn to fight
for your space more. He's much more sure of his game than he was when I first
saw him.";    While a 6-8 1/2 player normally stands out within a high school
league, don't expect Nanney to dominate the boards or the headlines in the
Mission Valley Athletic League this season.;    "I've never seen any league
with as many bonafide big men as we (have) this season," said Guin Boggs, who
is coaching his 10th season at Washington. "I'd venture to say this is the
best league in the Bay Area in the last 10 years."  </TEXT>
