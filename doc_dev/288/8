   Actors Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox and White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu are short in stature but tall on
style, said a clothier who put them on his list of the ``10
Best-Dressed Shorter Men in America.''
   Bob Stern, the 5-foot-2 president of Short Sizes Inc., said he
created the annual list four years ago to ``highlight that short
men can dress for success.''
   Cruise and Sununu are the tallest short men on the list. Both
just reach 5-foot-9, the maximum height for the list.
   Cruise is a trendsetter who has turned black sunglasses and
black silk shirts into a national passion, while Sununu ``never
beats around the bush'' in both politics and dress, Stern said.
   Fox, 5-foot-5, was named to the list for the third consecutive
year for ``charmingly combining a tux jacket and shirt with washed
jeans and tennis shoes,'' Stern said.
   Others listed, in ``descending'' order, are novelist Tom Wolfe
and the former host of television's ``This Old House,'' Bob Vila,
both 5-foot-8; singer Billy Joel, Broadway actor Robert Morse and
Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White, 5-foot-7; gymnast and television
sports analyst Bart Connor, 5-foot-6; and actor-director Danny
DeVito, 5-foot-1.
