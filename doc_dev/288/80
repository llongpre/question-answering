The big question facing the Loyola Marymount basketball team after losing its 
starting front line -- Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Per Stumer -- was where the 
power and rebounding were going to come from. 
</P>
<P>
The big answer Czeched into campus this week when 6-foot-10 Czechoslovakian 
National Team center Richard Petruska started classes. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody really knows what Petruska can do for the Lions. He wasn't a standout on 
the Czech team and he has never played in a run-and-gun system like Coach Paul 
Westhead's. As the Loyola coach wryly noted, "He has to make a double 
transition -- just playing U.S. college style basketball, and playing Loyola 
outer space-style basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Although Chris Knight's play in the NCAA Tournament was promising, the 6-9 
junior remains an unproven talent. The other returning front-line players, 6-7 
junior John O'Connell and 6-8 sophomore Chris Scott, are too small to defend 
imposing centers. In the coming season, the Lions will face the likes of 7-1 
Shaquille O'Neal of Louisiana State and 7-1 Ron Reis of Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
So at 6-10 and a self-professed 220 pounds, Petruska can be a physical force 
under the basket. Two years ago, when the Czechs played Loyola in an exhibition 
game, Petruska made 15 of 17 shots and scored 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a low-post player," assistant coach Jay Hillock said. "We think he can 
score points. He's not cat-quick like Hank, but we think he can be an impact 
player in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Petruska is believed to be the first Czechoslovakian player to play for an 
American college. The 21-year-old, who has friends in Fullerton and was looking 
to attend a California school, appeared headed to UCLA until Ed O'Bannon left 
Nevada Las Vegas and enrolled at Westwood. Petruska then turned to Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"When he told friends and relatives he was thinking about coming here, people 
in Czechoslovakia knew of our running game," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Leuice, Czechoslovakia, the left-handed Petruska played three 
seasons with the Czech team, making two U.S. college tours. His favorite stop 
was Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Petruska, who was cleared by admissions last week although he doesn't speak 
fluent English, has an idea of what Loyola's offense is about. "We run," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He will room with senior Tom Peabody and figures to pick up beach slang -- and 
probably assorted bumps and bruises -- quickly. He might even learn to "Hang 
10." 
</P>
<P>
If he can hang 18 or 20 points a night, grab rebounds and keep up with the 
fast-break style, Petruska might be the big man Loyola lacks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's bigger than we've been able to recruit," Westhead said. "We look to him 
as a player who can help us right away. His performance against us two seasons 
ago gives a pretty good indication of what he can do in our system." 
</P>
<P>
Before Hank Gathers, who led the nation in scoring and rebounding, Loyola 
centers in the 1980s were tall, but failed to make a major contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lahm, a 7-footer who weighed less than 200 pounds, had problems holding 
his own under the boards and transferred after two seasons to Murray State, 
where he ended up having a productive career. Leonard Agee, a 6-10 standout at 
Hawthorne High, added some offense punch but played only one season. Larry 
Irwin, at 7-2 the tallest player ever at Loyola, played two seasons without a 
notable contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' best big man in recent years was 6-10 John Veargason, who capably 
backed up Gathers when the team won the West Coast Conference Tournament went 
to the NCAA Regionals in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Cano is calling this a rebuilding year, but his counterparts around the 
country apparently have faith in the Cal State Dominguez Hills soccer coach. In 
the first Division II poll of the Intercollegiate Soccer Assn. of America, the 
Lady Toros are tied for second with North Carolina-Greensboro. The top-ranked 
team is another traditional power, Barry University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the top 10 are Dominguez Hills' perennial rivals Sonoma State (sixth) 
and Cal State Hayward (seventh). 
</P>
<P>
The Dominguez Hills men's and women's teams open the season at home on Saturday 
against San Diego State. The women play at 1 p.m., and the men at 3 p.m. The 
San Diego State men's team is rated 20th in Division I. The Dominguez Hills men 
are unranked. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Loyola Marymount volleyball Coach Steve Stratos said having 
assistants take over some coaching responsibilities has been a new -- and not 
entirely comfortable -- experience. Stratos, who has previously coached on the 
high school and club level, is Loyola's first full-time volleyball coach and is 
assisted by Larry Smoot and graduate assistant Pam Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
"I always believed you have to do everything yourself if you wanted it done 
right," Stratos said. "It's tough (for me) to delegate authority, but they've 
done such a good job I can step back, oversee things, step in when I see 
something and not actually get involved in every drill. I never trusted anyone 
enough before to do that."
