Choosing the best tree for your yard is a bit more complicated than just going 
to the nursery and buying whatever looks healthy and attractive. That cute 
little tree that looked so good in the container at the nursery may grow into a 
huge monster in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
You can avoid problems that homeowners most frequently encounter by asking the 
following questions: Is this tree suited to our climate? When mature, will this 
tree be too large for my yard? Does this tree have destructive or invasive 
roots? Is this tree messy, dropping leaves, flowers or fruit? Is this tree 
susceptible to any diseases or insects? 
</P>
<P>
You will also have to decide if you would like an evergreen or a deciduous 
tree, which loses its leaves every autumn. One beautiful tree can increase the 
property value of your home significantly, as well as create a warmer, more 
inviting appearance. I always recommend choosing a tree you really like, rather 
than just purchasing whatever tree seems suitable for a particular area of your 
yard. 
</P>

The 10 trees listed below have proven to be ideally suited to home landscapes 
in Southern California. They were chosen for their outstanding beauty, ease of 
care and freedom from the common tree problems. 
</P>
<P>
RIVER TEA TREE: Melaleuca leucadendron. Usually multi-trunked, this evergreen 
grows to 25-30 feet tall. It is native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, has 
attractive white bark and soft foliage. A perfect-size tree, this Melaleuca 
doesn't get too big, stays relatively narrow, yet is large enough to serve as a 
dominant tree in a landscape. It can also be used as a screen (plant trees 6-8 
feet apart), or to create a woodsy backdrop in a small yard. It is drought 
tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
PEPPERMINT TREE: Agonis flexuosa. Another Australian native, it grows to 25-35 
feet tall and is hardy to 25 degrees. The leaves have a slight minty fragrance 
when crushed. Small, white flowers appear in spring to summer. With this tree 
you get the soft, delicate, weeping effect similar to a weeping willow, only 
the Agonis is evergreen, drought tolerant and stays small. 
</P>
<P>
EUROPEAN WHITE BIRCH: Betula alba. A favorite because of its lovely white bark 
and graceful appearance, the Birch is deciduous and grows to about 50 feet. 
Both male and female trees bear small, cone-like catkins. It is tolerant of all 
soil types, including soggy soils. 
</P>
<P>
QUEEN PALM: Arecastrum romanzoffianum. The Queen Palm is hard to resist with 
its elegant, feathery leaves. It is used in a wide array of landscape designs, 
and is particularly stunning with Spanish or Mediterranean style architecture. 
The Queen Palm is a rapid grower to about 50 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
SWEET GUM: Liquidambar styraciflua. This is the tree for spectacular full 
color. The Liqidambar has maple-like leaves and spiny, round fruit in winter, 
which will need to be raked occasionally. It is deciduous and grows to about 50 
feet tall. Plant in front of a south window to help cool the house in the 
summer and to remind you what season it is when fall arrives. Suitable for 
planting in a lawn, Liquidambars will tolerate lots of water or can go for 
weeks between waterings. Liquidambars are used extensively as street trees. 
</P>
<P>
EVERGREEN ELM: Ulmus parvifolia. This elm has a lovely weeping, arching form 
and grows to about 60 feet tall. A fine, large specimen tree, not overwhelming, 
which benefits from occasional pruning, especially when young. 
</P>
<P>
MIMOSA OR SILK TREE: Albizia julibrissin. The mimosa is deciduous and fast 
growing to about 30 feet, with arching branches that form an umbrella-like 
canopy. It has light-green, fern-like foliage and beautiful, showy pink flowers 
in summer. The variety 'Rosea' is the hardiest and has the brightest flowers. 
The flowers will drop and make a pink carpet; if planted over a patio you will 
need to sweep occasionally. I think the flowers are worth it. Mimosas thrive on 
summer heat and require ample water. 
</P>
<P>
STRAWBERRY TREE: Arbutus unedo. This handsome evergreen grows to about 30 feet 
tall, is drought tolerant and is ideal for small yards or as an accent tree. 
Compact forms make wonderful container trees in a patio or entry. 'Compacta' is 
a compact form. 'Elfin King' is even smaller, growing to a maximum of 5 feet. 
White flowers and red or yellow fruit appear in fall to winter. Fruit is edible 
but not very tasty. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN MAGNOLIA: Magnolia grandiflora. This glossy evergreen is native to the 
southern United States and is prized for its huge, fragrant, 8-10 inch white 
flowers. The Southern Magnolia is tolerant of all soil types and grows to about 
80 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The dwarf variety 'St. Mary's' grows to only 20 feet and has the same 
spectacular flowers. Some people complain about the litter of fallen leaves and 
seed pods; the good news is they only fall a few at a time, are large, stiff 
(leaves are almost plastic-like) and are thus quick and easy to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE BLACK PEAR: Pinus thunbergiana. A versatile pine, native to Japan, it 
grows to about 20 feet tall and is easily pruned to achieve different looks. It 
is often used for an Oriental effect, as a bonsai tree, or as a single specimen 
tree.
