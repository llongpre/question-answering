   Buddhist monks chanted and prayed Friday to
welcome the completion of a smiling bronze Buddha half the height
of the Statue of Liberty that sits cross-legged on a hill outside
Hong Kong, facing China.
   Publicity material claims the 134-foot-tall, $7.7 million statue
is the world's tallest bronze Buddha in the open air. It was made
from bronze crafted in Communist China.
   The 250-ton statue sits next to the Po Lin Monastery on the
outlying Lantao Island, a one-hour ferry ride from downtown Hong
Kong.
   ``You can definitely see it from a plane,'' said architect Peter
Ng of the Buddha, which is about half the height of the 305-foot
Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.
   In a rain-soaked ceremony, a crane placed part of the Buddha's
head on top the statue while chanting monks circled it, blessing
the guests.
   The statue is the brainchild of Sik Chi Wan, 56, the monastery's
director who has lived there since he was 3.
   ``I ate the monks' meals and have to do something for the
monastery,'' said Chi Wan. He said that after viewing Buddha
statues in China, Japan and Taiwan, he asked himself: ``If they can
do it, why can't we?
   ``Hong Kong is such a prosperous place, we also need some kind
of religious symbol,'' he said. ``Lantao is a Buddhist holy land
and I think we can build it here.''
   The Buddha sits on a base that resembles a circular altar of the
Temple of Heavenly Peace in Beijing.
   He faces northeast, overlooking the monastery and, further out,
China. But Chi Wai said there is no political relevance to the
Buddha's facing China, which takes over this British colony in
eight years.
   ``We consulted a Fung Shui expert who said the direction would
give the greatest blessing to those who donated and supported the
construction of the Buddha,'' he explained.
   The project was funded by donors in Hong Kong and China, many of
whom will have their names and pictures placed on the walls of a
memorial hall at the statue's base. About $7.1 million was raised
in Hong Kong through the sale of commemorative cards, bronze coins,
and bronze Buddha figurines. The rest was raised by Buddhists in
China.
   Sitting atop the 1,591-foot Muk Yu (Wooden Fish) Hill, the
statue consists of 222 bronze pieces made by the Nanjing Chengguang
Machinery Factory in China. They have been assembled on the island
over the past three years.
   The Buddha includes many symbols, said Chi Wai. His half-open
eyes signals he is looking after the ordinary people. His right
hand, half raised, symbolizes the easing of pain on Earth. His left
hand rests on his lap with his palm facing out, a sign of giving
away happiness.
   Chi Wai believes his Buddha has no rival.
   ``Ours is better because it is taller, looks kinder and more
peaceful,'' he said.
   Chi Wai denied the project was an attempt to attract more
tourists to the island, already filled on weekends with vacationers.
   ``A Buddhist saying goes: `When you are confused, go into a
temple or tower. Once you say a prayer you will feel the truth of
Buddhism,''' he said.
   ``It means a religious person can feel the tranquility once they
see the statue. A non-religious person can also observe this work
of art,'' he said.
