   A computer hacker with a sense of honor
padded the dean's list at Valley College with such names as Wratha
Kahn, Gray Poupon, Hans Zoff, Roger Overndowt and Warren Peese.
   Seventy names added to the list published in the school
newspaper included Betty Crocker, Dee Generet, Rex Karrs, Claire D.
Aisle and about 25 real students.
   ``I personally feel it's insulting,'' said Lisa Walker, student
body president-elect, a sophomore who made the list the hard way.
``People work hard to be on the dean's list. It's not just a little
thing to me.''
   Making the list requires at least a 3.6 grade-point average out
of 4.0.
   The list apparently was doctored after it arrived at the
newspaper.
   ``We took the dean's list that was submitted to us and typed it
into the computer and proofread it a couple of times and stored it
on the disk,'' said editor Dean Hotta. ``About 15 or 20 people know
how to operate the machines. I haven't the slightest clue who did
it.''
   Gloria E. Miranda, an assistant dean, said President Mary Lee
may address the tampering at a Wednesday tea for the honorees.
However, dean's list No. 375 won't be there. His name is Dean Slist.

   Buffalo are more at home on the range, a
doctor has decided after five years of dealing with problems caused
by the freedom-loving American bison.
   Following a weekend in which seven fugitive buffalo had to be
killed after causing two accidents on Florida's Turnpike, Arnold
Oper has decided to sell all 60 remaining animals. They should go
for about $2,000 each, said his attorney Ron Lowy.
   That decision doesn't come soon enough for Greg Hintz, whose
1981 Chevrolet sustained $2,000 damage when he collided in the dark
with a group of four bison wandering across the highway Saturday
night.
   ``I was so mad that those things got on the turnpike,'' Hintz
said.
   Oper, south Florida's only buffalo rancher, was still trying
Tuesday to corral some of the 50 bison that escaped from his
Chi-O-Ranchero near the Dade-Broward county line. He has been
raising the animals for meat.
   Lowy said they have most of the remaining herd in a rock quarry,
but the bison keep swimming away into a lake every time wranglers
get near.

   Ever wondered which is the highest tree in
Lithuania? Or the tallest church? Those who find themselves
wondering about such things will doubtless be pleased with the book
of records which is soon to be published in the republic of
Lithuania.
   The book is expected to report the facts, for those who need
them, that the highest tree in Lithuania is a 46 meter larch which
grows in the Prenaysky region and the tallest church is 70 meter
St. Peter and Paul Church in Shaulyay.
   The famous basketball player Arvidas Sabonis reckons he's got
the title of the tallest man in the republic sewn up. Sabonis is a
7-foot-3\ center from Kaunas.
