Citing the desperate need for housing in Los Angeles, the Planning Commission 
on Thursday approved construction of three-story apartment buildings beside 
single-family houses in the Valley Village area of North Hollywood, enraging 
many residents. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Valley Village, a quiet enclave in the southern portion of North 
Hollywood, began fighting four years ago to keep tall apartment buildings, 
known to opponents as "stucco mountains," from overshadowing their expensive 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders said they are confident that the City Council will overturn 
the commission's unanimous vote and approve a two-story height limit 
recommended by a citizens advisory committee, which met for nearly two years to 
draw up a land-use plan for the area. 
</P>
<P>
The council will vote on the plan after the Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee holds a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The plan covers a 1 1/2-square-mile area bounded by the Hollywood Freeway on 
the east, the Tujunga Wash next to Coldwater Canyon Avenue on the west, the 
Ventura Freeway on the south and Burbank Boulevard on the north. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Joel Wachs, Zev Yaroslavsky and John Ferraro, who represent the 
area, are sympathetic to residents' concerns about lack of privacy and support 
the lower height limit, according to their deputies. 
</P>
<P>
But developers and others may lobby council members in coming months to accept 
the three-story restriction approved by the commission. At Thursday's 
commission meeting, land use consultant Howard S. Raphael of North Hollywood 
called the two-story limit punitive. And Fred Russell, a retired movie 
technician who owns a small apartment house on Whitsett Avenue, said lower 
height limits would be overkill. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, building in the area is restricted by a temporary ordinance. 
The moratorium, approved in November, 1986, expires later this year, but the 
City Council can extend it for one year. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance restricts development in several ways, limiting all new buildings 
to two stories and holding the square footage of commercial developments to 1 
1/2 times the size of the lot. Building apartments and condominiums on property 
zoned for commercial use is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the three-story limit, the commission required developers to 
provide five feet more space between their projects and adjoining residential 
properties than is ordinarily required. The actual distance between the 
buildings and houses depends on the size of the apartment buildings. 
Commissioners said the additional space would help offset the impact of the 
three-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission action is meant to maintain the balance between the time 
residents put in on this and the citywide concern over the need for housing," 
said William G. Luddy, commission president. "I'm afraid the need for housing 
is a nasty problem, and there's no clean and easy solution." 
</P>
<P>
But Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood Residents Assn., said the 
three-story height limit would encourage developers to knock down older 
buildings and displace residents who pay monthly rents of $400 to $700. 
</P>
<P>
"What good does it do to have older buildings replaced by high-rent ones that 
cost $800 to $1,400 a month? " said Hunter, who was a member of the citizens 
advisory committee. "We sat night after night to come up with a plan, and what 
good did it do if the Planning Commission and the city staff don't listen?" 
</P>
<P>
City planners, who recommended taller height limits than residents wanted, said 
their job is to strike a balance between all the interests involved.
