<LEADPARA>  A VEGETABLE and a flower that persist in today's gardens as they did well
before grandmother's day have been designated by the National Garden Bureau
(NGB) as the 1991 Vegetable and Flower of the Year.;    They are the versatile
beet and the charmingly graceful cosmos.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This recognition, conferred annually by Downers Grove, Ill.-based NGB,
which represents the American garden seed industry, highlights the many
virtues of the plants. Last year's selections were broccoli and nasturtium.;  
 In keeping with the occasion, and of significant interest to home gardeners,
are the often fascinating facts dug up by bureau researchers probing into the
background of the vegetable and flower selected for current acclaim.;    Early
breath freshener;  The familiar red beet, for example, was once a tough white
root that still grows wild along the Mediterranean seacoast. Although it was
not considered edible then, NGB researchers found that Pliny the Elder had
advised that "the . . . non-fatal but socially serious problem of garlic
breath could be lessened by eating a roasted beet.";    Somehow, between the
2nd and 16th centuries, the tough white root became an edible red one. The
first description of a red beet comes from an English naturalist, John Gerard,
who acknowledged its southern European heritage by referring to it as the
"Roman beet . . . surnamed Sicilia.";    In his encyclopedia of plants, "The
Herbal," Gerard noted also that beet greens " . . . boyled and eaten with
oyle, vinegar and pepper is a most excellent and delicate sallad.";    As for
the "red and beautifull root," he suggested that it was wholesome but left the
cooking instructions up to " . . . the curious and cunning cooke . . . who
will make many and divers dishes, both faire and good.";    More beet notes; 
Other NGB notes on the beet:;    (check) Early settlers raised crops from
seeds they brought to the New World or received from European contacts.;   
(check) Mangel-wurzel, a large, coarse beet from Germany, was sent to Martha
Washington to grow in her plantation gardens. This was the forerunner of the
mangel beet used today for livestock feed.;    (check) By 1821, beets were
said to be as common in the United States as carrots were in England.;   
(check) As they became more popular, ingenious uses for them came to light,
such as women using the juice from a cut beet as a stain to rouge their
cheeks.;    (check) New varieties gradually were introduced, including the
yellow beet developed in the Languedoc region of France. By 1880 a dozen
varieties, including white, yellow and red, were grown in the United States.
Some cultivars have been bred for the fine eating quality of their nutritious
leaves.;    (check) Beets belong to the Chenopodiaeceae, or Goosefoot family,
so called because some species have leaves that resemble the webbed shape of a
goose foot.;    There are two significant beet shapes: globular, ranging from
round to somewhat oval, and cylindrical, having a long tapered shape somewhat
like a thick carrot. Some have been downsized to a "mini-beet" ready for
harvesting at 1 1/2 inches, which can be served whole.;    The seed, which
looks like a shrunken, withered pea, actually is a dried fruit that may
contain one to four seeds. The seeds can be sown as soon as the ground can be
worked in spring. Plants will thrive in a well-prepared soil in a sunny
location but must be thinned adequately to develop fully.;    South-of-border
cosmos; Small-scale cosmos;  Cosmos, like marigolds, dahlias and many other
warm-weather annuals, traces its origin to South America and Mexico, where
Spanish priests grew them in their mission gardens. Once only tall, sprawling
plants relegated to the back of the border, recent breeding efforts have
produced scaled-down versions.;    The garden bureau chose the 1991 Flower of
the Year to salute both the old-fashioned and newly bred cosmos, which is so
diverse that an annual bed could be planted solely with cosmos for a
scintillating display.;    Depending on variety, plants may be short or tall,
each yielding a profusion of single or semi-double flowers with petals that
are daisylike, quilled or anemone-shaped, typical of the Compositae family.;  
 Of the more than 20 known cosmos species, two annual kinds, C. sulphureus and
C. bipinnatus, are the most familiar to home gardeners. These are easily
differentiated by leaf structure and flower color.;    Leaves of C. sulphureus
are long with narrow lobes and hairy margins, with flower colors always in
shades of yellow, orange or red. C. bipinnatus has finely cut foliage, not
unlike that of ferns, and white or pink to dark rose flowers. Typical are the
Klondyke series in the sulphureus group and the Sensation series in the
bipinnatus group.;    The free-flowering habit of cosmos and its varied
heights make it adaptable to specialized garden needs. Tall kinds make an
attractive backdrop; medium height varieties are ideal for massed beds, while
the dwarf cultivars are showy in borders and containers. All are a bountiful
source for cut-flower bouquets.;    Cosmos is not fussy about soil
requirements but will perform best when grown in a light, well-drained soil.  </TEXT>
