   It might be just another Loch Ness
``Nessie'' or Lake Tahoe ``Tessie'' _ water beasts that catch the
imagination but somehow are never trapped themselves.
   But at least a couple of people near Wadsworth have reported
seeing an alligator in the Truckee River, and state game wardens
are taking the claim seriously enough to set baited traps for the
reptile.
   So far, however, the 'gator, described as 3-4 feet long and 3 or
4 years old, has given authorities the slip.
   Jim Curran, the state's regional fisheries supervisor, said the
reported alligator is too small to pose a threat and might not
survive the near-freezing winter waters anyway. The reptiles
normally live in tropical rivers and marshes.
   ``We figure this one must have been someone's pet,'' Curran
said. ``When it got too big, they dumped it in the river.''
   The first reported sighting came Oct. 14 when Jack Maughan said
he spotted the snub-nosed reptile in the river while taking his
daily walk along the bank. And Maughan's son, Bryan, says he saw
the animal Sunday.
   The story of the Wadsworth 'gator sightings isn't being ignored
by the town, located about 10 miles east of the Reno-Sparks area.
   Tom Peterson, the local fire chief and owner of the Wadsworth
Inn, has made T-shirts boasting the town is the state's 'gator
capital. And this weekend the fire department volunteers are
hosting an Indian taco feed featuring ``super-hot 'gator sauce.''
   Meanwhile, the story continues to grow.
   ``Yeah, it's 3 to 4 long, but at 11 o'clock, after a few beers,
that 'gator gets to be a 16-footer,'' claims Peterson.

   Veteran liars here saw a familiar fib
when they read a story this week about a liars club in Nebraska.
   A lie judged good enough to get the alleged author inducted into
a liars hall of fame in Nebraska in 1987 bears a striking
resemblance to a lie that won a Missouri man the title of World
Champion Liar in the Burlington Liar's Club 1979 contest.
   Robert Peterson Sr., of Dannebrog, Neb., claims one day in
February it was so cold that he saw a lawyer with his hands in his
own pockets.
   That tale got Peterson inducted into the National Liars Hall of
Fame in Dannebrog.
   But in 1979, C.A. Laurie of Eckland, Mo., was named World
Champion Liar by the Burlington Liar's Club for saying it was so
cold in Missouri one winter that he saw a politician standing on
the street corner with his hands in his own pockets.
   ``The lie we named a champion years ago was told with a
politician _ not a lawyer,'' said Don Reed, vice president and
20-year member of the Burlington Liar's Club.
   But Reed said he doesn't mind.
   ``I feel there should be nothing to stop anybody from telling a
tall tale,'' he said. ``We're dedicated to the perpetuation of the
American heritage of telling tall tales.''
   ``But we'll always be the granddaddy of them all,'' he added.
   The Burlington Liar's Club was founded in 1929 and chooses its
winner each New Year's Eve. Entries come from all over the country
and world. Last year, more than 200 lies were sent to the
Burlington club.
   At least, that's what they say.
