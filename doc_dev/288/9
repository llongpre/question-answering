<LEADPARA>  Renee Silverthorn remembers being called the "Jolly Green Giant" in junior
high. At 6 feet, she's also had her share of dancing partners whose heads
rested squarely on her chest.;    "I really stood out; I couldn't hide," said
Silverthorn.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Silverthorn is through hiding. As Miss Tall Detroit, she was one of 20
women 5 foot 10 or over who competed in the annual Miss Tall International
Pageant on Tuesday night at the Dunfey Hotel in San Mateo.;    Now in its 44th
year, the pageant has been a longtime favorite event at the Tall Clubs
International's annual convention. This year, the convention has gathered more
than 300 men (6 feet 2 or taller) and women (5 feet 10 and above) from across
the country, as well as Canada and Europe.;    "It's definitely a highlight,"
said pageant director Winnie Heinson. "It's our glamorous portion of the
convention.";    For Silverthorn and a number of competitors, entering the
pageant was a chance to shake that old gawky, beanpole image once and for
all.;    "When I was in high school, there were no dates, no proms," said
Gayle Garubba, Miss Tall Orange County. More important for Garubba, however,
her regional pageant came at a time when she was recovering from a divorce and
raising two children on her own. "It was a really fun thing for me," she
said.;    Contestants came from as far as Philadelphia and Boston to compete
in this year's pageant. The only non-American was Canadian Rose Carnduff. "I'm
the international part," Carnduff said with a laugh.;    Dubbed "Long-stemmed
Rose" by her friends, the sales representative from Toronto planned to impress
the judges with her version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Trouble in River
City" -- with a few personal modifications.;    "I had trouble, big, big
trouble, with a capital T and that stands for Tall," she sang in a warm-up
before rehearsal.;    Six-foot-2 1/2-inch Barbara Keller from Pittsburgh hoped
to score with her parody of a Beatles song she calls "When I'm Six Feet Four."
Other talent programs included baton-twirling and a tap-dance number.;   
Heinson said the winner receives a crystal set, gift certificates for shops
specializing in tall women's fashions, and an all-expenses-paid trip to
Europe, where she will meet with other tall clubs.;    Missing from this
year's event was the swimsuit competition.;    "I think there were some people
who thought it was sexist," said Heinson, who was a runner-up in the pageant
in 1961. "Now we just have a pageant rather than a beauty pageant. Personality
overrides long legs!" she quipped.;    Rest assured, the tables will be turned
Friday night when the men bare their own legs for a shot at the "Mr. Tall
Toga" crown.  </TEXT>
