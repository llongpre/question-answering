<TEXT>     DON Melvin, commander of Torpedo Bombing Squadron Fifty-One, stood
alongside the blackboard in the ready room of the fast aircraft carrier USS
San Jacinto and looked out at the 13 pilots and 32 enlisted men in his
squadron as they were being briefed on that morning's assignment by Lt. M.E.
"Buster" Kilpatrick, the air combat intelligence officer.;    In his heavy
Georgia drawl, Kilpatrick told the men their mission was a bomber strike on
the radio tower transmitter atop Mount Yoake Peak on Chichi Jima, one of three
islands in the Bonin chain, which also included Iwo Jima. For a time, the
Japanese on the tiny island had been intercepting U.S. military radio
transmissions and warning Tokyo and occupied enemy islands of impending
American air strikes. Also a key supply center, the Bonins were only 600 miles
south of Tokyo, and the Japanese had dug in for a protracted fight.;     As
Kilpatrick continued his explanation of the day's mission, Melvin studied the
men in his squadron. Today, like every other day, he was concerned about them:
He had already lost six pilots, and, he considered each man as family. He
himself had but one mission in life: to get all of them back home safely.;   
George Herbert Walker Bush, at 6 feet, 2 inches, was the tallest and the
youngest pilot in the squadron.;    Melvin knew all the facts in Bush's
records. He had enlisted in the Navy's flight training program on his 18th
birthday and had become one of the youngest commissioned pilots in the U.S.
Navy when he won his wings.;    The lanky boy from New York had blue eyes, a
thatch of brown hair and a wacky sense of humor; he had given nicknames to
almost every pilot in the squadron. He was the best at playing Twenty
Questions, the game pilots played on the flight deck to while away boredom
between flights. Only the day before, Bush had correctly deduced from the
clues that the right answer to a tough question was "George Washington's right
eyebrow.";    Dutiful all the way;  Melvin had heard that the young pilot came
from a wealthy Eastern family, but Bush never spoke about them. Bush had good
manners and spoke with a correctness rare even among officers. The young pilot
kept his own counsel, wrote a lot of letters, and read voraciously. He was a
good athlete, the man to have on your side in a volleyball game on the hanger
deck. He wasn't a natural flier who could fly by the seat of his pants, but he
was capable, and, when given an order, carried it out without griping or
questioning. He was a kid doing a man's work, and Melvin was glad to have him
aboard.;    The pilots listened intently. Although they knew that some of them
might not make it back to the carrier, after several days of inactivity they
were eager to see action. It was their responsibility to fly the enormous
single-engine TBF (Torpedo-Bomber by Grumman) Avenger planes to Chichi Jima
and drop their four 500-pound bombs on the target.;    When Kilpatrick
finished his briefing, Melvin took over.;    Battle plan;  He gave the plan of
attack. Bush and two other pilots from the squadron were to try to bomb the
transmitter, during a strike on Futami Harbor by torpedo and dive-bombers from
the heavy carrier Enterprise.;    His instructions were brief. "The radio
station is your primary target," he said. "The dock is your secondary. Don't
waste your bombs. If you can't hit the primary, go for the secondary.";   
There was no joking around at the briefing session, which was all business.;  
 "One last thing," Melvin said before dismissing his pilots. "If you're on
target while making a dive-bombing run, drop your bombs and get the hell out
of there. There's no point in getting yourself shot up.";    The flying
fiancee;  Tall as he was, George Bush was dwarfed by his aircraft. The TBF
Avenger of World War II was the largest single-engine carrier-based plane in
the world. The standard joke among the pilots was that, weighing eight tons
loaded, it could fall faster than it could fly. The 40-foot-long Avenger
towered almost 18 feet over the carrier's deck. It had a 54-foot wingspan
(reduced to 19 when the wings were folded.) Like all Navy planes, it was
painted ark blue on top fading to white on the bottom of the fuselage and
wings. A large "2" was stenciled aft of the wings of Bush's plane, and "2X"
was painted on the rudder. Just under the cockpit, his gunner, 20-year-old Leo
"Lee" Nadeau, in contravention of Navy practice, had long ago painted Barbara,
the name of Bush's fiancee.;    Melvin was the first to be catapulted from the
carrier. Then it was Bush's turn. The catapult officer gave him a signal to
rev up. He stayed at full throttle until the ship's deck tilted upward and the
catapult officer crossed his arms over his chest -- the ready signal.
Released, the catapult pulled the huge plane down the flight deck,
accelerating it from zero to 172 mph in 120 feet, slamming Bush and his crew
back into their seats.;    The deck disappeared in a flash of light, replaced
by the blue waves of the ocean. Bush breathed a sign of relief as he felt the
plane airborne: Although he had made more than 100 carrier takeoffs, he was
never sure whether the gargantuan plane would gain altitude or just plop down
into the water under the carrier's bow.;    Hit and run;  Within half an hour,
they were at their assigned altitude of 9,000 feet, and Bush could make out
the jagged peaks of Chichi Jima off in the distance. He pulled out the chart
board and glanced from the map out to the island; there was the harbor, and
rising above it the mountain with his primary target. The other squadrons
began to dive on Futami Harbor. Their attack caught several enemy vessels out
in the harbor, and as Bush watched, he could see one of the fighters dive low
to strafe a small cargo ship.;    Melvin peeled off and in a steadily
accelerating glide headed straight for the radio tower perched on the slope of
Mount Yoake. Tracers rising from the ground like Roman candles probed the
squadron leader's aircraft as he released his bombs. Seconds later Bush saw
the buildings surrounding the tower explode in orange flame. The skipper made
a wide, gentle turn toward the ocean and gained altitude. He would wait for
the other planes of his squadron to join him and then head for home.;   
Dodging bullets;  Suddenly Bush saw and felt the pounding jolt of black
shell-bursts from Japanese anti-aircraft guns, the heaviest flak he could
recall. Realizing that the Japanese gunners had him in a cross fire, he tried
to maneuver his plane to make himself a difficult target. He rolled the huge
Avenger nearly over, pulling the plane's nose onto the target from an inverted
position. As the plane dived, his weight was no longer on his back and seat
but forward against the seat harness, his feet pressed on the rudder pedals.
As the earth raced toward him, he fought to keep the plane on target while
holding the dive.;    The sudden drop in altitude hurt his ears, and he
shouted to relieve the pressure. He glanced at his altimeter: The thin, black
needle was dropping swiftly. He kicked the plane onto target and looked down
into the stream of tracer bullets streaking over the cockpit. Had the Japanese
gunner down there on the island moved his barrel a fraction of an inch, the
Avenger would have been hit.;    Narrow escape;  On target, Bush pressed the
electrical switch that opened his bomb bay doors. As he hit the button on the
bomb release, an explosion just off his wing rocked the aircraft. But it was
too late to make a correction. He continued the dive and pulled up only 200 or
300 feet above the water.;    He was so occupied with managing the plane that
it was moments before he reacted to Lee's frantic voice on the radio: "Gunner
to pilot. Are you all right?";    "Pilot to gunner," he replied. "I'm OK, but
I had to drop low. They were right on us and I was busy.";    Bush made a
sharp turn to the left and poured on the power. It was time to rendezvous with
the rest of the squadron and head home. But Bush's heart was heavy. Because of
the mass of flak, he knew that he had missed the transmitter. From what he had
seen, none of the other Avengers had scored direct hits, either.;    At the
debriefing session after the flight, Bush learned that VT-51 was going to have
to strike Chichi Jima again the next day. The future president of the United
States had no idea that that day -- Sept. 2, 1944 -- would be the longest and
saddest in his life.;    NEXT: Shot down  </TEXT>
