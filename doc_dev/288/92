   Etched in granite, ``Kid Of Courage'' tops
Ryan White's gravestone.
   The epitaph, composed by his mother, are three of the more
modest words that adorn the monument to the Indiana youth, who
spent the last five years educating the public about AIDS.
   The words of Gov. Evan Bayh, singers Elton John and Michael
Jackson join those of the White family on the headstone that was
placed Monday at Ryan's gravesite, nearly two months after his
death of complications from acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   No stone covered the grave before Monday, only flowers and notes
from thousands of well-wishers and wax from a candle that was lit
twice each day.
   His mother, Jeanne White, spent the time designing the monument
that was dedicated on Memorial Day, when U.S. servicemen are
honored for losing their lives in wars. Ryan was remembered at the
dedication by friends and family as having fought an equally
arduous battle.
   ``I think about him everyday _ several, several times,'' his
uncle, Tom Hale, said before about 75 people who attended the
dedication. ``Don't weep for me, meet me. That would be his
prayer.''
   White, who contracted AIDS through blood products he was taking
for his hemophilia, was less than 5 feet tall, but his gravestone _
in black and white, his favorite colors _ stands 6 foot, 8 inches,
his mother said.
   ``He liked to say he was five foot. He always wanted to be tall.
He wanted to be big and be like Howie Long,'' Jeanne White said of
the defensive lineman for the Los Angeles Raiders.
   Inscriptions on front and back of the gravestone tell the story
of his 18 years. After a lengthy legal dispute between 1985 and
1987, Ryan won the right to attend school outside of Kokomo, but
ugly stares and ill feelings drove him, his sister and mother to
Cicero, 30 miles north of Indianapolis.
   In the interim, he endeared thousands as a proponent for AIDS
education, including singers John and Jackson. Words from songs
performed by both entertainers, who remain close to the Whites, are
inscribed on the monument.
   ``Turn me loose from your hands. Let me fly to distant lands.
Fly away skyline pigeon fly, from all the things you left so far
behind,'' are words on the stone from ``Skyline Pigeon'' that John
sang at Ryan's funeral in Indianapolis.
   ``Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right,'' are attributed
to Jackson on the stone.
   And from family and friends: ``We're sure going to miss you
Ryan.''
   Neighbors and friends offered testimonials about encounters with
White during the dedication, and the choir director of Hamilton
Heights High School, which Ryan attended, sang ``The Lord's
Prayer.''
