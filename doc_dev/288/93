Who's wearing the pants when it comes to downtown redevelopment? 
</P>
<P>
The Centre City Development Corp.'s approval last month of a 36-story luxury 
condominium tower shows that the financial viability of a project often takes 
precedence over urban design concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Going against the advice of its design specialists, the CCDC granted exclusive 
negotiating rights for the high-rise project to the Koll Co.-Davidson 
Communities team. It will be built at the southwestern corner of State Street 
and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Architect Mike Stepner and CCDC urban-design expert Max Schmidt both 
objected to the height of Koll's project, known as the Huntington and designed 
by San Diego architects Lorimer-Case. Even CCDC board President John Davies had 
reservations about its 472-foot height, which will make it one of the two or 
three tallest buildings downtown, dwarfing its immediate neighbors: the 
20-story Koll Center just to the west, the mid-rise Columbia Tower seniors 
housing project to the south and the six-story Hotel San Diego to the east. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Argument 
</P>
<P>
Approval came only after the CCDC's economic consultants, Keyser Marston, 
stated that a 10-story reduction in the building's height 'would materially 
affect the feasibility of the project.' Potential buyers of the $300,000 to $1 
million homes, according to Davies, would only be lured by a landmark building. 
Apparently nothing less than 36 stories would do. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Smyk, the developer of the Meridian, San Diego's existing luxury high-rise 
condo tower, doesn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
"A landmark building doesn't sell condos," he said. "A landmark building has 
more value for office prestige than condos. The important things are the views 
and the interior layouts. My opinion is the best views in the Meridian are on 
the 12th or 15th floors. I live on the 24th, and it's too high. There's no 
relationship to the street or other activities. The higher you go, the views 
almost get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Also, there aren't that many buyers for such pricey condos. What if Smyk, who's 
sold 130 of 172 luxury units in the Meridian in four years and may find his 
project competing with Koll's when it comes on line, has already tapped out the 
market? 
</P>
<P>
If a lower luxury condo tower simply didn't appeal to developers, why not a 
different brand of project? 
</P>
<P>
Competing developer A. J. Lirot's proposed 400-foot rental apartment tower was 
more in scale with the neighborhood. The architecture wasn't everyone's 
favorite, but the size was right on. CCDC felt the Koll team was stronger 
financially, and wasn't swayed when Lirot brought in high-powered developer 
Trammell Crow as a partner after the submissions deadline. 
</P>
<P>
A look at CCDC's original request for proposals (RFP) for the State and 
Broadway site, and subsequent alterations to it, show that CCDC was resigned 
months ago to a building the size of the Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The first RFP asked for a building matching the adjacent Koll Center in scale. 
In November, under pressure from the Koll team, CCDC decided to permit a 
building of 600,000 square feet on a site that, by some interpretations of 
CCDC's guidelines, should have accommodated about half that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flip-Flop Decisions 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington occupies only part of a larger piece of redevelopment land 
referred to as "Parcel C," which also includes the Koll Center and the Columbia 
Tower. In simple terms, the CCDC decided that, because the Koll Center wasn't 
built to the maximum allowable height for Parcel C, the new condo tower would 
be allowed to use up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Such flip-flops are what will determine whether we get a hospitable downtown 
with ample glimpses of blue sky and sunlight or a Manhattan-like urban core 
where giant buildings dwarf the scale of smaller nearby structures. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Great American Plaza, under construction across Broadway a few blocks 
west of the Huntington will be of equal height. But, from the northern side of 
Broadway, it won't cast shadows on downtown's most significant street. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Stepner commented on the Huntington, "When you're a block away, you 
will see the relationship between the various buildings and will notice the 
height. It's not a good fit." 
</P>
<P>
Since the '60s, the CCDC's Schmidt, in various capacities as a city planner, 
has favored locating downtown's tallest buildings near Interstate 5 and Cortez 
Hill, site of the El Cortez Hotel. In his ideal scenario, they would have 
decreased in height closer to the water, giving most downtown offices and 
residences good bay views and keeping the waterfront free from a wall of 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
But '60s and '70s high-rises were built in the heart of downtown. Now, with the 
intense development of lower Broadway, including not only the Huntington but 
the Great American project and the 30-story Emerald Shapery Center nearby, 
along with hotel and residential towers along Harbor Drive, Schmidt's fantasy 
is being reversed, with the tallest buildings closest to the water. 
</P>
<P>
If CCDC is willing to let economics double the size of Koll's building, what 
will happen in the '90s when a huge new wave of high-rise proposals comes in 
for the substantial properties near the water owned by Santa Fe (the railroad 
company) and the Navy? 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that height got out of hand at the Huntington, because, in other 
ways, it shows just how much progress the CCDC is making in getting good 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residential Character 
</P>
<P>
Unlike existing downtown high-rises, this one has a base, middle and a 
distinctive top the architects hope to sheath in copper. The base is scaled to 
match older nearby buildings such as the YMCA and Hotel San Diego, both in 
height and detailing, with the tower set back from the base. Altogether, the 
design, as Schmidt noted in his design analysis, gives the building a 
distinctly residential character apart from downtown's office high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
With CCDC giving Koll a discount on land the public agency has owned for 
several years, San Diegans have a right to expect the highest urban design 
standards, even if they won't be able to afford a home there. Koll bid $2 
million for the land, valued by a downtown real estate expert at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stepner believes a smaller building, even a condominium tower, could have been 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the fine points of the deal, but, from my experience over the 
years, I know that each developer will take the same exact situation and create 
a different deal that works for him. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: James Hubbell, Gerrit Greve, Ed Pieters, Malcolm Leland are among 
more than 60 artists participating in the Art Auction being presented by the 
New School of Architecture's Class of '89 on June 10 at 7 p.m., 1249 F. St., 
downtown San Diego. Part of the proceeds go to the school. . . . The La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art's show on architect Emilio Ambasz opens June 11. . . 
. San Diego architect Chuck Slert won two of nine 1989 design awards presented 
by the California Council of the Society of American Registered Architects for 
his designs of Rio Vista Tower in Mission Valley and the 9444 Balboa office 
building.
