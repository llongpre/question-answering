   Three protesters trying to halt a new
animal research lab remained atop a 160-foot construction crane
today after University of California officials turned down their bid
to end the 6-day-old sit-in.
   The three offered on Sunday to come down if the school dropped
all charges against them.
   ``We said, `Absolutely not,''' said John Cummins, assistant to
the chancellor. ``We are going to wait them out.''
   The protesters originally numberd six when they climbed the crane
on Tuesday in an effort to stop construction of the $14 million
Northwest Animal Facility.
   The university got a court Friday to order them to stop the
protest. Four climbed down, but one went back with a new supply of
food Saturday morning. Today, school officials vowed to go back to
court to seek sanctions against the protesters for not following
Friday's order.
   The new laboratory will consolidate animal research labs. Two

   Few from the West get to see North Korea, the
hermit of Asia. But Associated Press correspondent Cinty Li, who is
based in Hong Kong, recently was allowed to travel to Pyongyang for
a rare look at what's going on in a country that has largely sealed
itself off for four decades.

   Along the wide and immaculately
clean streets of Pyongyang, women with their heads wrapped in white
scarfs and men bundled up against the winter morning cold trudge off
to work.
   Most walk alone, their faces stern, their steps steady. Many wear
a tiny enamel picture pin of President Kim Il Sung, the omnipotent
dictator who has ruled the Communist nation throughout its four
decades of existence.
   Pyongyang is the capital of one of the world's most insular and
repressive countries, which is frequently accused of terrorist
activity and basic human rights violations.
   But this hermit of the world has begun to show stirrings of more
contact with the outside world, particularly with its two main foes,
the United States and South Korea.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into a communist North and
capitalist South after World War II. Although the two sides have yet
to sign a peace treaty after their 1950-1953 war, they are engaged
in cautious attempts to ease tension by talking about topics ranging
from a non-agression pact to trade.
   Meanwhile, North Korean and U.S. diplomats recently met in
Beijing, China's capital, in a rare display of direct contact.
   In July, Pyongyang will play host to the 13th World Festival of
Youth and Students, a gathering of communist and socialist youth
groups that North Korea expects will attract about 20,000 delegates
from more than 100 nations. The city also is under consideration as
site for the 1989 World Student Games.
   North Korea eagerly awaits the 13th World Festival and hopes it
will enhance the country's international stature, particularly after
the humiliation of watching Seoul, the South Korean capital,
successfully stage the Summer Olympics last year.
   ``With the opening day of the festival approaching, our hearts
are rushing to its venue,'' Kim Dong Yong, head of a train passenger
car workshop, wrote in a typically worded article in the official
magazine, Korea Today.
   Colorful posters announcing the coming festival ``for
anti-imperialist solidarity, peace and friendship,'' dot the
otherwise drab landscape of Pyongyang.
   Tourists who come to the capital are shown the facilities under
construction for the event, including the 150,000-seat Rungnado
Stadium on an island in the River Tae Dong and a 105-story building
said to be the world's tallest hotel.
   What festival-goers will see when they visit Pyongyang is perhaps
the world's ultimate Communist capital, unfettered by grand
reminders of a non-communist past. While Moscow has the Kremlin and
Beijing has the imperial Forbidden City, modern Pyongyang was built
from rubble after the Korean War.
   Today it is a city of 2 million residents, blocks of tall and
uninspired apartments, and six-lane streets uncluttered by vehicles,
leaving traffic police plenty of rest as they mechanically direct
the occasional bus, truck, East European car or sleek Mercedes.
   Commuters descend into chandeliered stations to take the subway
or patiently line up at bus stops. Pedestrians at major
intersections use underpasses beneath the broad streets despite the
dearth of traffic.
   Men in green military overcoats are visible on nearly every
street, although some carry briefcases and appear heading to work.
One carefully eyed a foreigner who bought a newspaper at a kiosk in
the capital while another blocked a tourist from taking a picture of
a dirty child at the border town of Sinuiju.
   The streets of Pyongyang are deserted at night, with only a dim
glow coming from street lamps and apartments. All revolutionary
monuments and statues, however, are bathed in lights.
   Socialist realism is the art style. Prime examples include a
heroic statue of a table tennis player and an indoor mural of
victorious communist forces, bloodied but not vanquished, smashing
the U.S. Army, which is reviled because it came to the aid of South
Korea in the Korean War and since.
   A two-hour acrobatic performance viewed by a group of tourists
included a skit about the downfall of a U.S. military policeman, who
was a caricature with blond hair, crooked nose and slightly hunched
back.
   A North Korean farmer got the best of the U.S. soldier by
tricking him into pulling a snake from a straw basket. The snake bit
the soldier until he fell unconcious. Placed on the fallen GI's back
was the slogan: ``American soldiers go home.''
