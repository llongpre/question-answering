   Though the Tallis Scholars seldom sing anything
more recent than the 17th century, Peter Phillips doesn't consider
the group to be part of the early music revival.
   Nor does the young conductor worry very much whether the
Scholars mimic the sound of the Renaissance.
   ``We can't possibly guess, and we can't possibly know,'' he said
during the British group's recent U.S. tour. ``It's not like
digging up an instrument which has been buried, and reanimating
it.''
   The standard of authenticity, for Phillips, boils down to what
sounds good. ``I hope that is based on how the choirs were
constituted, and how it did sound in the 16th century,'' he added.
   The Scholars are now the busiest exponents of sacred music of
the Renaissance, and are doing well enough to sustain their own
label, Gimell.
   Tallis Scholars recordings have a heavily English flavor, with
two by Thomas Tallis, two more featuring the music of William Byrd
and the Missa Gloria Tibi Trinitas of John Taverner.
   There is also a single recording of music by the contemporary
composer John Tavener, who was commissioned by the Scholars.
   However, the group's best seller has been its recording of two
masses by Josquin Desprez, a Flemish composer who died in 1521. The
performance was honored as record of the year for 1987 by
Grammophone magazine.
   Debates about the performance of ancient music are often heated,
and at times extreme. Phillips said he has heard it categorically
stated that the music of Palestrina was meant to be sung one voice
to a part, and that the music of Lassus ideally should have 12
voices per part _ though the two men were contemporaries writing in
similar styles.
   ``Experts tend to have their hobbyhorses, I find,'' Phillips
said. ``I can't afford to get bogged down with these endless
details, and not see my way through to a good performance.
   ``In the end, I am most interested in preserving this beauty of
sound, and I will not let dogmatic authenticity get in the way.''
   The voice he wants, Phillips says, is one ``which can sustain a
contrapuntal line without distorting the texture, and that requires
singing in tune and without very much vibrato.''
   The group which toured this country included two basses, two
tenors, two countertenors (male altos) and four women sopranos. The
use of women, rather than boy sopranos, is Phillips' most obvious
departure from the practice of the 16th century.
   Phillips argues that ``authentic'' boy sopranos are no longer
available, because boys' voices now break at age 12 or 13. In the
16th century, voices broke in the late teens, so the boy soprano of
the time would have a riper voice and greater maturity as a
musician.
   Furthermore, Phillips said it is likely that women were used in
some Renaissance music, such as Byrd's later works for the private
chapels of Roman Catholic families. Whether that music was for one
voice or two voices per part, Phillips said, ``was very much a
question of how many people turned up for service.''
   Phillips, 35, was never a choirboy _ ``my parents did not think
of it, they aren't musical'' _ but he became interested in
Renaissance music as an undergraduate at Winchester College. He won
an organ scholarship at St. John's College, Oxford, where he claims
to have been a very indifferent performer.
   In the early 1970s, he came under the spell of David Wulstan's
choral group, the Clerkes of Oxenford, which was founded in the
1960s and used women. The Tallis Scholars were found in 1973, and
became a fully professional group in 1978.
   The Scholars are the only group recorded by Gimell, the
Oxford-based label which Phillips founded in partnership with Steve
C. Smith after cutting two records for EMI.
   ``It was obvious they weren't particularly interested,''
Phillips said. ``They wanted a money-spinner.''
   With his own label, Phillips has been able to record the music
of composers such as Clemens non Papa, who is obscure even within
the small world of early music. Gimell will soon release what is
apparently the first recording of music of Sarum chant, the
liturgical music of medieval England.
