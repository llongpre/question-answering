  [Text] A PNP [Peruvian National Police] National 
Antinarcotics Directorate (Dinandro) spokesman has said that 
U.S. assistance in the fight against drug trafficking in Upper 
Huallaga has been cut back, but not eliminated. The U.S. 
Embassy also said that the U.S. Government has not suspended 
that assistance. 
  Our source said that the fact that the 10 UH-1H and Bell 212 
helicopters owned by the U.S. Department of State had been moved 
to the Pucallpa base does not mean that helicopter operations 
have been suspended. 
  It was reported that the helicopters have more space to 
operate from Pucallpa. 
  The spokesman said that if required, four helicopters can 
fly 
to Tarapoto and take Dinandro personnel to the area chosen for 
an intervention. 
  If helicopter support is required in Ciudad Constitucion 
(Junin) similar trips can be arranged. 
  It was also reported that helicopters can depart from their 
base in Pucallpa and easily reach the La Convencion (Cuzco) 
valley or Palmapampa (Ayacucho jungle zone), which are areas of 
intense coca production. 
  The sources reported that two planes that the U.S. 
Department 
of State had placed at the disposal of the Peruvian police for 
the transportation of personnel and equipment from Lima to the 
"Santa Lucia" antinarcotics base (Upper Huallaga) have already 
returned to the United States. 
  That was the reason why the climate in "Santa Lucia" was one 
of uncertainty and scarcity. 
  The Air Force was making regular flights to that base 
carrying gasoline, food, and personnel. 
  The fuel for generators used in the Upper Huallaga base, as 
well as food shipped to the PNP and FAP and the $90 per month 
incentive for police personnel assigned to Upper Huallaga, have 
also been curtailed. 
  The "Santa Lucia" base has, however, an FAP M-17 helicopter 
with greater capacity for carrying personnel, which can be used 
for helicopter antinarcotic operations. 
  It was reported, however, that those operations are 
difficult 
to carry out during these months due to the bad weather 
prevailing in the jungle zone.
