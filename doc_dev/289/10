   Bad weather and mechanical failure are
suspected in the crash of a U.S. anti-drug helicopter in the Andes
that injured the three Americans and two Peruvian policemen on
board, the U.S. Embassy says.
   Leftist rebels and drug traffickers are active in the area in
eastern Peru but were not believed to have been involved in
Friday's crash of the Un-1 Huey helicopter, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The helicopter went down while flying with two others from Tingo
Maria, 200 miles northeast of Lima to Mazamari, 175 miles east of
Lima, and came to rest 12,000 feet up a mountain, the spokesman
said.
   No reason was given for the crash, but the spokesman said
without elaboration that bad weather and mechanical failure were
suspected.
   Peruvian police have bases in Tingo Maria and Mazamari that are
involved in the anti-narcotics program, supported by the U.S.
government.
   The Americans worked for National Air Transport Inc., which has
a State Department contract to provide support to Peruvian police
and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Peru.
   The names of the injured could not be released for security
reasons, he said. The five were evacuated to a hospital in Tingo
Maria, he said.
   The Embassy spokesman said the Americans _ a pilot, medic and
mechanic _ suffered ``injuries and fractures,'' but said he did not
know the seriousness of the injuries.
   The spokesman said a Peruvian police gunner riding in the
helicopter appeared to be the most seriously injured.
   Ten Huey helicopters are on loan from the State Department. They
are used by anti-drug agents and Peruvian police in raids on coca
fields, processing laboratories and clandestine airstrips in Peru's
Upper Huallaga Valley.
   The helicopters are piloted by contracted American civilians and
Peruvian co-pilots. They operate out of the U.S.-built base at
Santa Lucia, 250 miles northeast of Lima.
   Twenty to 40 U.S. drug agents are stationed at Santa Lucia to
assist police.
   The base at Mazamari is a training camp where U.S. Green Berets
instruct Peruvian police in jungle warfare. The Embassy says about
12 Green Berets are stationed at Mazamari.
   The Embassy spokesman would not comment on the purpose of
Friday's flight.
