  [Text] Puerto Maldonado -- Since mid-1993, Peruvian and 
foreign drug traffickers have chosen Puerto Maldonado as the 
shipping center and exit point for drugs produced in Peru in 
their attempt to dodge the cordon established by the security 
forces in the traditional cocaine production areas. 
  This was proved by three operations carried out by the armed 
and police forces during the past five weeks, during which the 
largest amounts of drugs were seized. 
  A total of 3.5 metric tons of washed cocaine base paste were 
seized on 26 February at Boca Manu airport and more than 1 
metric ton of cocaine base paste on 24 and 26 March at an 
airstrip in Inapari, capital of Tahuamani Province. 
  In every case the cocaine was ready to be loaded on an 
aircraft bound for Colombia, where it was going to be made into 
cocaine hydrochloride that would then be sold in the United 
States and Europe. 
  It was disclosed that the drugs seized in Boca Manu belonged 
to the ``Cachique Rivera firm'' and that Colombians were 
involved. 
  It also was disclosed that the drugs seized during the two 
latest operations at Inapari airstrip and the Santa Rosa de 
Fatima farm (15 km from the Shirimayoc checkpoint on the 
Brazilian border) allowed the breaking up of another ``firm'' 
that supplied drugs to an organization of Colombian drug 
traffickers headed by an individual identified as ``Guido 
Correa.'' 
  PNP [Peruvian National Police] General Sixto Gutierrez, head 
of the PNP 10th Region, told an EL COMERCIO correspondent that 
``Guido Correa'' lives in Cauca Valley (Colombia), from where he 
directs his organization. 
  In view of the harassment by security forces in Upper 
Huallaga, Ucayali, and Ayacucho (where his aircraft used to land 
to load drugs), he decided to find another place for his 
shipments. 
  For this reason he sent to Peru six members of his 
organization identified as ``Andres,'' ``Dario,'' ``Tarzan,'' 
``Bebito,'' ``Lazo,'' and ``Cucaracha,'' who clandestinely 
entered the country between 14 and 15 March through the 
``Palestina Peru'' area on the border of La Convencion (Cuzco) 
and Ayacucho. They were received there by Peruvian citizen 
``Caliche,'' with whom they made their first contacts. 
  From there they decided to send to Inapari Colombians Miguel 
Manosalva Contreras, 26, Ruben Dario Arango Santa, 35, and 
Andres Ramirez Piedraita, 32, as well as Brazilian Alsimar 
Marquez Da Silva, to buy drugs. 
  Once in Inapari they contacted ``Fernando,'' who is the 
organization's coordinator and, with ``Piston,'' the main drug 
supplier. 
  Thus they managed to gather an initial amount of 400 kg of 
cocaine base paste, which they shipped to Colombia on 20 March. 
Since they saw that there seemed to be no problems they decided 
to continue operating in Inapari and, what is more, built an 
airstrip on the Santa Rosa de Fatima farm. 
  The Army and the PNP, however, thanks to intelligence work, 
found out about this new organization and carried out an 
operation that allowed them to seize more than 1 metric ton of 
cocaine base paste and arrest 23 drug traffickers. Two 
policemen also are being investigated.
