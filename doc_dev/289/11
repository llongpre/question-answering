   Teams of workers armed with gas-powered
weed cutters are destroying clandestine plots of coca seedlings,
reflecting a policy change by Peru following the drug summit in
Colombia last month.
   Peruvian police and U.S. anti-drug agents are supervising the
small-scale operations in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley,
targeting isolated fields of young plants before they can be
transplanted to larger areas.
   The move to destroy the coca fields marks a renewal of a
government policy suspended more than a year ago. An alarming
increase in acres planted has prompted the government to renew the
eradication program, according to U.S. Embassy spokesman Gene
Bigler.
   ``(The Peruvian government) has asked us for our support in
eradication, and, of course, we're delighted,'' Bigler said.
   President Alan Garcia had temporarily halted joint anti-drug
operations and threatened to boycott the February drug meeting with
President Bush and the leaders of Colombia and Bolivia because of
the U.S. invasion of Panama in December. He later attended.
   The eradication teams operate out of the U.S.-built base at
Santa Lucia, 265 miles northeast of Lima in the Upper Huallaga
Valley, the world's richest source of coca leaf.
   About 350 eradication workers are stationed in the area along
with about 120 Peruvian police and 30 to 40 U.S. drug agents,
contracted American helicopter pilots and mechanics.
   Ten UH-1 helicopters on loan from the State Department ferry the
workers from the base to clandestine seedling plots, hidden under
the dense jungle canopy throughout the valley.
   Despite a drastic drop in price over the last six months for
Peruvian coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, Peruvians
continue to move into the valley hoping to get rich off the cocaine
trade.
   ``They're cutting down all the trees,'' said Gen. Juan Zarate,
head of Peru's drug police, from the back seat of a Huey helicopter
cutting through the heavy jungle air 500 feet above the valley
floor.
   Zarate pointed out new coca plantations carved out of the jungle
hillsides, creating a haphazard patchwork of emerald hues up and
down the valley.
   ``There's going to be so much environmental damage,'' he said.
   Zarate was taking reporters to visit a herbicide test site,
where government scientists were studying the environmental effects
of applying the herbicide Spike to illegal coca fields.
   Spike is one of a number of eradication methods under study.
U.S. officials favor its use, saying testing so far indicate it
does not cause ecological damage. But the Peruvian government has
said more tests need to be done before it would consider using the
chemical.
   The Cartagena Accord signed during the summit by President Bush,
Garcia and the presidents of Bolivia and Colombia, linked
eradication to development aid and the opening of U.S. markets to
crops such as coffee, cocoa and palm oil to give the coca growers
alternative means of support.
   However, the Bush administration has said it is reluctant to
fund development projects with Peru's 3,000 percent inflation and a
growing leftist insurgency by Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who
operate freely in much of the valley.
   Since September, the police have conducted raids against
airstrips and jungle laboratories used by smugglers to transform
the leaves into a semi-refined paste and ship it to Colombia, where
it is made into cocaine.
   The police have destroyed about 125 labs since September,
according to an embassy official.
   But despite interdiction efforts in Peru and Colombia, where
authorities have confiscated hundreds of airplanes used by the
smugglers, a recent U.S. government report says the number of acres
planted in coca in the Andean nations grew by 12 percent last year.
   More than 250,000 people are involved in growing and processing
the drug in Peru, bringing more than $1 billion a year into the
country, according to U.S. and Peruvian government estimates.
   The government estimates that coca grows on half a million acres
in Peru, with 60 percent of it in the Huallaga Valley.
   As the helicopter swooped over a small ridge, Zarate looked down
on a woman and child standing next to a thatched hut with their
latest coca harvest drying in the sun nearby.
   ``What we need is to give these people something else to do so
they stop moving in here,'' the general said.
