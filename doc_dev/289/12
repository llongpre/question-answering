  [Text] A high-ranking officer at the Santa Lucia police 
base has reported that a group of peasant patrols located in 
Peru's coca-producing regions is offering protection to drug 
traffickers operating in these areas, in exchange for large sums 
of money. 
  The police officer, who asked not to be identified, added 
that in view of this it is very likely that the peasant patrol 
members will refuse to hand over the guns that were supplied to 
them by the government to protect their towns against terrorists. 
  He said that the Peasant Patrols have cooperated actively in 
the pacification of the country, and that through their active 
presence Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] lost a great deal of their prevalence. 
  He said that, unfortunately, the strong economic incentive 
offered by drug traffickers for looking after coca farms allows 
the peasant patrols to improve their standards of living, while 
no alternative development programs have been promoted for 
cultivating other products instead of coca. 
  Moreover, intelligence service reports state that there are 
bad armed forces and police officers detached in the area who 
are also offering protection to drug traffickers in exchange for 
money. 
  The staff at the Santa Lucia base, which was built with the 
DEA's support to combat drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga 
region, is already aware of the situation. 
  As an example of these charges, the police officer said that 
the peasant patrols in Pampapalma, in La Mar Province, Ayacucho 
Department, "do not allow the police to enter the area, and 
openly support drug traffickers."
