efforts in Peru have been thrown into confusion by a shift in US policy

THE new US administration and its shift in drugs policy threw anti-drugs
efforts in Peru into confusion.
This month the US Drugs Enforcement Agency said it would probably have to
cease operations out of the Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga
valley, Peru's main coca-growing area. The base is being put in jeopardy by
cuts called for by the US Senate in the State Department's anti-drugs
efforts.
Meanwhile the US administration is carrying out an inter-agency review of
its anti-narcotics efforts, which is expected to result in a reduced
emphasis on international interdiction and eradication efforts. Human rights
concerns, after President Fujimori's institutional coup on April 5 last
year, have already led to cuts in US military aid. The US Senate voted last
week to suspend aid to Peru until it compensates survivors of a US airman
killed when a Peruvian military aircraft strafed a US C-130 transport
aircraft on a Peruvian-authorised anti-narcotics mission in April 1992.
The Santa Lucia base - which costs an annual Dollars 13m - seems to have
succeeded in reducing trafficking out of the Huallaga Valley - only to move
it to more remote areas.
'It's worked as far as it goes, but you'd need 20 or 30 Santa Lucias to be
able to control the main trafficking regions in the country,' says one US
official.
Nearly two thirds of the world's supply of cocaine comes from coca produced
in Peru. The US State Department said in a report to Congress in February
that there are 129,100 hectares under coca production, of which over half is
in the Huallaga valley. (Peruvian officials often cite an area twice as big
or more.)
Official Peruvian policy is aimed at containing the growth of coca
production. It emphasises alternative development for farmers and crop
substitution, a solution hindered by the remoteness of the coca-growing
areas and a lack of roads.
Peru ratified the 1988 UN convention on narcotics in January 1992, after
which legislation was introduced to make money laundering a crime and to
control chemicals used in cocaine production.
The police have been responsible for anti-narcotics operations; the army for
the fight against terrorism. The links between drugs traffickers and
terrorism brought calls for efforts to be better co-ordinated.
However, the police have generally been jealous of their territory, while
the army is often accused of being in the pay of drugs traffickers.
Retired General Gaston Ibanez O'Brien denies that the corruption of army
officers by drugs traffickers is as widespread as often depicted. Still he
admits it goes on. 'Where there are drugs, there is corruption. It's fatal.'
The problem is worsened by low pay: a general commanding a division is paid,
he says, Dollars 320 a month. 'People are vulnerable when they are paid so
little: it's not justifiable but it's understandable.'
