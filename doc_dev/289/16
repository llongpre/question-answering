   U.S. drug agents in Peru, frustrated by
heavily armed guerrillas in the world's foremost cocaine-producing
region, needlessly risked their lives last month to capture a
guerrilla flag in a jungle clearing, the State Department's chief
watchdog said Thursday.
   ``It was an outrageous use of a government chopper, and they put
themselves in harm's way unnecessarily,'' department inspector
general Sherman Funk said after he disclosed the incident at a
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing.
   The June 13 incident illustrated the difficulty agents face in
trying to run eradication programs in the Upper Huallaga Valley,
which is essentially controlled by the ruthless Sendero Luminoso,
or Shining Path, guerrillas.
   Guerrilla activity, including frequent firefights with
government police and military, has forced U.S. officials to close
down their eradication efforts until a fortified base can be
completed at Santa Lucia. That base may be ready for use as early
as next month.
   But Drug Enforcement Administration agents, apparently angry at
being stymied by the guerrillas, swooped down onto an island in the
Huallaga River to seize a Sendero Luminoso flag after first
riddling the ground with gunfire, Funk said. The incident was not
the first of its kind, he added.
   The incident involved two U.S. government helicopters. If there
were guerrillas present, they did not return fire and were not seen
by the agents, Funk said, adding that the U.S. Ambassador in Lima,
Alexander F. Watson, ``blew his top'' when he heard about it.
   Five of the people involved, including DEA agents and private
pilots working under contract for the government, have either been
disciplined or ordered out of the country, he said.
   ``It is one of those unfortunate things,'' said Melvyn Levitsky,
assistan secretary of state for international narcotics matters,
who acknowledged management and coordination problems in the
programs.
   But Levitsky and other top anti-drug officials defended their
efforts, although imperfect, as the only alternative to a total
surrender to drug producers.
   David Westrate, assistant DEA administrator for operations, said
he still believed the government ultimately can cut by half the
flow of cocaine from South America to the United States. Nearly all
production comes from Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley and the Chapare
province of Bolivia, he noted.
   Authorities should be able to gain increasing control of air,
land and water routes out of those areas and cut the flow of coca
leaf and paste to Colombia, where it is refined, packaged and
shipped, he said.
   ``We can't solve this at home, alone,'' Westrate said. ``We have
an opportunity to make a dramatic difference, and we have to pursue
that.''
   He acknowledged there is inefficiency in current efforts to
manually dig up coca plants and use jungle raids to destroy crude
processing laboratories, and noted there will be increasing danger
of violence to those involved as pressure on producers mounts.
   ``We cannot wait for a perfect solution,'' he said, noting that
delay only serves to allow more money, weapons and equipment to
flow to drug producers and groups like the Shining Path guerrillas.
   Funk said a recent trip by his investigators to both countries
showed there had been improvements in DEA training and that more
agents now are able to speak Spanish. Aircraft maintenance and
equipment also had been improved, he said.
   But other problems turned up in an inspection trip a year ago
remained, including lack of any emergency evacuation plan for
American personnel working in the Upper Huallaga Valley and feeble
eradication efforts.
   ``Coca production in these countries has increased every year
and less than one percent of the illicit drugs have been seized,''
Funk testified. He said it remains uncertain whether the programs,
which have cost more than $100 million since 1972, will have any
meaningful impact on cocaine exports.
