  [Text] Defunct U.S. radar installations have permitted 
Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers to once again collect 
drugs in the Upper Huallaga valley, from where they "moved" some 
years ago when the FAP [Peruvian Air Force] began operations 
there. 
  Proof of this is a seizure by Dinandro [Antidrug Division] 
of 
537 kg of cocaine base, weapons, and communications equipment on 
5 June in Biabo district, Bellavista province, San Martin 
department. 
  Biabo, which is on the left bank of the Huallaga River, six 
km from Bellavista, had been free of traffickers. 
  The traffickers are said to have returned to the area. An 
individual known as "Lucho Tulon" might be one of the big shots. 
  The drugs, weapons, and communications equipment were buried 
in three "cellars"--a type of silo--some 500 meters from a house 
that had been raided. 
  This is one of the most important events, following the 
seizure of 3,500 kg of cocaine base in Boca Manu, El Diamante, 
Madre de Dios, and in Inapari. 
  Actions by the Army and the Antidrug Division (Dinandro) of 
the PNP [Peruvian National Police] in coca producing areas in 
Apurimac, Ayacucho, Pasco, and Madre de Dios has helped to drive 
traffickers to Upper Huallaga. 
  As is known, when FAP Tucano planes began operations in 
1992, 
the interception of Colombian traffickers' planes was 
intensified. 
  Some 200 small planes and civil planes are known to have 
been 
intercepted in coca growing areas since the start of FAP 
operations. 
  FAP Tucano planes operated from illegal airstrips in the 
jungle, helped by the U.S. radar installations in Yurimaguas, 
and the Orion and AWACS planes. 
  As of May, however, the United States suspended radar 
operations leaving FAP Tucano planes without classified 
information to help intercept traffickers' planes. 
  The traffickers took advantage of this and have resumed 
their 
illegal work in the Huallaga region.
