   A secret directive in President Bush's $7.9
billion drug program may allow a greater role for the U.S. military
in the cocaine-producing countries of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.
Here is a report on U.S. efforts in those countries so far.

   The U.S. military presence is small but slowly spreading in the
heart of South America's cocaine country.
   Expansion is most evident in Peru, where about 20 U.S. Army
Special Forces members quietly arrived three months ago and are
providing paramilitary training to national police in their battle
against a fearsome alliance of cocaine traffickers and Maoist
guerrillas.
   In Bolivia, where the fight is less dramatic but equally
entrenched, about a dozen Green Berets have been conducting training
and support operations from low-profile jungle base camps for years.
   The confidential White House directive giving the American
military more leeway in the drug war was crafted with Peru and
Bolivia in mind, according to officials in Washington.
   In Colombia, home to the biggest cocaine cartels, U.S. officials
deny any military intentions beyond those associated with the
delivery of hardware.
   About 200 soldiers, including advisers, trainers and technicians,
accompanied the recent arrival of two C-130 transport planes, A-37
observation and attack jets, UH-1H Huey helicopters and other
equipment in an emergency U.S. aid package for Colombia's
anti-narcotics offensive.
   But U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara told reporters the U.S. crews
would get the gear working, give some instruction and then get out _
most of them within a few hours or days.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco repeatedly has insisted his
country wants U.S. money and equipment, not troops.
   Direct American military action would almost inevitably produce a
wave of anti-U.S. nationalism and would certainly embarrass the
Barco government, which has pressed for the United States to get out
of Central American conflicts.
   Peru and Bolivia, much poorer countries, also oppose major U.S.
troop involvement but have allowed some training and support
personnel to operate.
   In Peru, about 20 bilingual Green Berets began instructing
anti-narcotics police at a special base near the central jungle town
of Satipo, officials from the U.S. Embassy in Lima told The
Associated Press.
   ``It's intensive training, almost one-on-one,'' said embassy
spokesman Gene Bigler. ``They're taking small groups of 40 to 50
policemen and training them five weeks at a time.
   ``There's one whole section on entering and leaving helicopters
under fire.''
   He said the policemen also are taught map reading, battlefield
first aid, jungle patrols and night patrols.
   ``It's the same kind of paramilitary training that DEA agents are
now getting before they arrive in Peru,'' Bigler said.
   The training program is designed to last two years, with
Peruvians then taking over the instruction.
   Bigler said U.S. authorities hoped the trained Peruvian officers
would be assigned to a newly built, heavily fortified police
garrison at Santa Lucia.
   Several former Green Berets on contract to the U.S. government
for anti-narcotics efforts in Peru designed the Santa Lucia base,
which includes an airstrip big enough for C-130s, three helicopter
pads and nine buildings ringed by barbed wire and mines.
   It is the centerpiece in a new, militarized strategy in Peru,
where most of the world's coca is cultivated. Much of it is grown in
jungle areas controlled by the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla
organization.
   ``Santa Lucia is probably better fortified than most military
bases in Peru,'' said Craig Chretien, the Drug Enforcement
Administration chief in Peru.
   Pistol-packing DEA agents have been seen routinely accompanying
Bolivian, Colombian and Peruvian police in raids on cocaine
processing laboratories and traffickers' jungle hideouts. About six
U.S. Border Patrol agents assist in interdiction efforts. They are
all under strict orders to avoid armed clashes.
   DEA agents are among the U.S. military's harshest critics.
   Speaking privately, they contend that U.S. soldiers lack
political sensitivity. They fear an increased American military role
would bruise Latin egos and ruin relations with local authorities
and sources.
   ``If the Special Forces come down here on raids, I am pulling out
of here. They are going to come down here thinking this is a war
zone and start shooting at farmers, when what you need here is
another kind of presence,'' said one DEA agent in Bolivia.
   When Green Berets accompanied Bolivian police on a raid in April,
a U.S. soldier walked off with a confiscated shortwave radio,
insulting a police commander who told him the radio had to be
properly registered, sources said. DEA agents had to intervene in
the dispute.
   Nonetheless, about a dozen Green Berets have worked with the
Bolivian police force's elite anti-narcotics division, called the
Leopards, for more than two years. It is widely acknowledged that
disclipine among the Leopards has improved.
   The U.S. Embassy in La Paz, the Bolivian capital, said it is
ready to extend the instruction program.
   ``U.S. troops will not seek out conflict or combat, but we are
prepared to expand our training role,'' embassy spokesman Bruce
Wharton said.
   The biggest U.S. military splash in the drug battle was made in
July 1986, when 175 U.S. soldiers descended on Bolivia and helped
the Leopards raid laboratories in the country's tropical lowlands.
   The three-month operation drove traffickers underground and
paralyzed cocaine processing operations in Bolivia, the source of up
to 30 percent of the world's cocaine.
   But officials reported no noticeable effect on the flow of the
potent white powder from South America to the United States.
