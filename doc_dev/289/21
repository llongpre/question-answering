  [Text] The Air Force invested 3 million soles in 1993 to 
control the 17 airstrips and airports in Upper Huallaga, and in 
infrastructure and equipment for the various groups deployed in 
the area. 
  This figure does not include the allocations for flight 
hours 
and fuel used by the Air Force for interdiction operations. 
  Among the Upper Huallaga airports that the Air Force began 
to 
control in July 1992 are those in Santa Lucia, Tocache, Uchiza, 
Saposoa, Bellavista, Juanjui, Tarapoto, Yurimaguas, Sion, 
Palmapampa (Ayacucho), Izcosazin, and Caballococha (Amazonian 
Trapeze), Puerto Bermudez, and Pucallpa. 
  Concerning the Palmapampa airport, which is located in La 
Mar 
Province (Ayacucho), the Air Force has controlled it since 1 
November 1993. 
  This airport was very important for drug trafficking in the 
area, because that area had become a drug trafficking storage 
center. 
  The drugs were taken from Upper Huallaga to this area, to be 
loaded in small Colombian planes that took off in Colombia, 
crossed Brazilian airspace (Cruzeirodo Brasil zone), and arrived 
in Palmapampa.
