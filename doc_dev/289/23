  [Text] Swift contact between the Peruvian and Colombian Air 
Forces permitted the detection of a light airplane belonging to 
Colombian drug traffickers in Peruvian territory. FAP [Peruvian 
Air Force] fighters destroyed the plane because its crew refused 
to obey the orders of the Peruvian military pilots. The 
Colombian plane, a "Turbo Commander" with forged license 
OB-2113, was destroyed at an illegal airstrip 20 km southeast of 
`Palma Pampa' (Ayacucho), while loading bags of drugs. 
  The plane was spotted thanks to Colombian radar operating in 
that country's jungle. Through a radio message Colombian 
authorities passed the information on to their Peruvian peers. 
  It was established that the plane entered Peruvian territory 
from Brazil, between Iquitos and Leticia, flying at 22,000 feet, 
that is, at 7,000 m. 
  After the plane was spotted in Peruvian airspace, the FAP 
high command in Huallaga immediately sent two fighters to 
intercept it. The fighters took off from the Santa Lucia police 
antinarcotics base and headed for Luisiana (Ayacucho). When the 
plane was spotted it was loading bags of drugs and fuel for a 
trip to Colombia. 
  The FAP planes fired machine-gun bursts, which caused the 
plane to catch fire. The plane was destroyed. At the airstrip 
there were at least 15 people supporting the crew. 
  This is the 11th small plane belonging to drug traffickers 
that the FAP has destroyed over the past few months.
