   U.S. drug officials are concerned that a
disruption of cocaine production in Colombia because of the
government crackdown will raise cocaine prices in Peru and Bolivia
and make it harder to persuade farmers to switch from coca leaf to
other crops.
   An estimated 300,000 people in Bolivia depend on coca farming and
cocaine production for a livelihood. Coca leaf still provides a 100
percent profit to farmers and coca-leaf acreage increased by 20
percent in 1987-88, according to a U.S. State Department report.
   For farmers to stop growing coca leaves, viable alternative crops
must be found. But with the recent drop in the price of coffee _ a
crop suited for the tropics where coca is grown _ and the lack of
other profitable alternative crops, farmers prefer to grow coca,
which provides four crops a year and is easy to sell.
   The Bolivian government last year passed a law that limits
coca-leaf acreage. President Jaime Paz Zamora's government, which
was sworn in Aug. 6, says it will wage an all-out war against
traffickers.
   Coca-leaf reduction in Bolivia is moving ahead but slowly as the
new government implements an anti-drug strategy.
   Bolivian law calls for the reduction of 12,350 acres of coca land
by the end of the year in order to comply with a quota agreed upon
by the U.S. government. If the quota is not reached Bolivia stands
to loose $10 million in aid. This year so far only about 3,200 acres
have been destroyed.
   In Peru, coca leaf reduction programs in the 150-mile Huallaga
Valley, 300 miles northeast of Lima, have been temporarily suspended
because of threats to U.S. drug agents and the killing of Peruvian
officials.
   Coca farmers and traffickers in Peru have allied themselves with
insurgency groups, among them the Shining Path, and many coca-leaf
producing areas are off limits to law enforcement officials.
Eradiction and interdiction activities in the Huallaga Valley are
expected to resume this month when a secure base is completed in the
Santa Lucia area.
   Peru destroyed 12,670 acres of coca in just four months last year.
   Peru produces coca leaves on 285,600 acres. It is the main
supplier of paste for Colombian cocaine producers and distributors.
