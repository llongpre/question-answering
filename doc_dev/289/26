   A 22-year-old nurse who testified as a witness
to the 1988 massacre of 29 peasants, allegedly by army troops, was
shot and killed at her home in Ayacucho, police said Saturday.
   They also reported at least three people were killed in clashes
involving rebels of the Maoist Shining Path movement and police near
Huancayo.
   Martha Crisostomo was believed to have been the last living
witness who testified to investigators about the May 15, 1988,
killings of 29 civilians in the village of Cayara, 230 miles
southeast of Lima.
   Three other people who testified against the army in the
investigation, including Cayara's mayor, were slain earlier this
year.
   According to police, eight armed people wearing hoods broke into
Ms. Crisostomo's home on Friday and fatally shot her and a
companion, Olga Farfan, a high school student.
   Government investigators are examining accusations that soldiers
killed the villagers in reprisal for a rebel ambush of an army
convoy on the outskirts of the town. The government has not issued a
report on its investigation.
   The Shining Path movement launched its armed insurgency in 1980
in the mountainous area around souch-central Ayacucho. The
guerrillas now operate throughout the country's Andean highlands and
in the coca-producing jungles in the northeast.
   By government estimates some 15,000 people, mostly civilians,
have been slain in the fighting.
   Also Saturday, reports published in Lima newspapers said army
unit killed 20 rebels after they attacked a police vehicle near the
anti-drug base at Santa Lucia, 270 miles north of Lima.
   The newspaper El Comercio said soldiers killed 20
``narco-terrorists'' between the towns of Uchiza and Progreso in the
Upper Huallaga River Valley. The valley is the source of much of the
world's coca leaf, the raw product for cocaine.
   The Shining Path allegedly works in alliance with drug
traffickers in the area, offering them protection from police in
exchange for payment.
   In other incidents, a policeman was killed by Shining Path rebels
who interrupted classes at a high school near Huancayo Friday to
urge students to join their movement. Police said they persued the
rebels and killed one of them.
   In Orcotuna, 10 miles from Huancayo, a street vendor was killed
Friday when his stand was dynamited by a group of presumed
terrorists, police said.
