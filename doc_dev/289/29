   U.S. military troops may be given an expanded
role in the Latin American drug war, according to a secret section
of President Bush's anti-drug program quoted in a published report.
   A National Security Decision Directive signed by Bush would
authorize U.S. Special Forces to accompany local forces on some
narcotics patrols, The Washington Post reported in its Sunday
editions.
   The directive would allow deployment of U.S. military in
``secure'' areas of Peru's Upper Huallagua Valley, a coca-growing
jungle that U.S. officials have acknowledged is ``effectively
controlled'' by far-leftist Shining Path guerrillas, the unnamed
sources told the newspaper.
   Officials estimate that more than half the cocaine consumed in
the United States comes from coca grown in the Upper Huallagua.
   A senior administration official quoted by the Post said the
directive doesn't call for any combat role for U.S. troops or covert
operations in Peru, Bolivia or Colombia.
   But the official, who was not named, said as many as ``several
hundred'' U.S. military trainers, advisers and other support
personnel may be deployed to the three countries under the ``Andean
initiative'' announced by Bush.
   A National Security Decision Directive conveys a presidential
decision to key government officials who must implement it.
   Bush unveiled his anti-drug strategy in a nationally televised
address last Tuesday, but a portion of the program remains
classified.
   The administration has said repeatedly in recent weeks that it
would not consider sending U.S. combat troops to Colombia unless
that country made such a request. Colombian President Virgilio
Barco, whose government is waging a bloody war with drug
traffickers, has said he does not want U.S. troops.
   There has been no public discussion about U.S. military troops in
Peru or Bolivia.
   Administration and congressional sources told the Post that the
directive calls for enhanced involvement by the Pentagon and U.S.
intelligence agencies in the drug effort and includes language that
loosens rules for U.S. troops in the Andean region.
   A rotating team of about a dozen U.S. Special Forces from the
Southern Command in Panama has been based in Bolivia's Chapare
region for about two years to help train that nation's
anti-narcotics police. Under existing rules, U.S. troops are
restricted to their base camp and are prohibited from accompanying
the local police on patrols.
   The directive relaxes those rules, permitting the U.S. military
to accompany troops on ``routine'' patrols, the Post said. However,
it does not allow U.S. military to direct raids or attacks on drug
labs or trafficker hideouts, an official told the newspaper.
   In addition, the Post reported, the directive would permit the
deployment of the Special Troops in ``secure'' or ``safe haven''
areas of the Upper Huallaga Valley, including a newly fortified base
at Santa Lucia used as the staging ground for joint raids by
Peruvian police and a small team of Drug Enforcement Administration
agents.
   During internal debates, DEA and some State Department officials
argued against deploying U.S. troops in Peru, saying it would give
the guerrillas American targets, the newspaper said.
