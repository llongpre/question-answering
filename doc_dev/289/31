  [Text] EL PERUANO was able to establish that the struggle 
against drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga could be more 
effective if the helicopters the Air Police use in the thick 
jungle areas were equipped to fly at night. 
  This is because of the new tactic used by Colombian drug 
traffickers who land their modern aircraft at night, taking 
advantage of the fact that police aircraft do not have night 
vision devices to detect them and react immediately. 
  An Air Police member commented: ``When we started our 
antinarcotic operations in the Upper Huallaga we struck hard 
blows against drug trafficking but all these operations were 
carried out in the daytime. Now the Colombian traffickers carry 
out their operations at night, which complicates matters for 
us.'' 
  In addition to limited operational capacity are the 
helicopters' years of service. In the 60's, the UH-1 
helicopters played an important role in the Vietnam war due to 
their great maneuverability and their capacity to escape unhurt 
from the most incredible war situations. 
  However, 30 years later, it can be said that the UH-1 
helicopters have completed their operational cycle. Therefore, 
those operating in the Upper Huallaga must be replaced. 
Accidents have occurred, but the Peruvian police pilots' skill 
has prevented greater disgraces. 
  Another member of the force said: ``We need training to 
operate at night with night vision devices because this would 
make our work more effective. If we had this our actions would 
certainly seriously wound this illegal trade.'' 
  This policeman has every right to say what he said because 
the information supplied by the silent DEA aircraft, which 
operates with its turbines off in the middle of the night in the 
jungle, cannot be used by the Peruvian pilots because their 
aircraft only fly during the day. 
  Although this has by no means affected police pilots' 
morale, 
neither can it be said that their effectiveness is minimal. 
Facts prove it: The results would be much more significant if 
only they were to operate under other conditions.
