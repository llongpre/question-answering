   The military is threatening to shoot down
airplanes suspected of carrying semi-processed coca leaf, the raw
material of cocaine.
   A communique Thursday from the military joint command said
airplanes that refuse to land for inspection or that change their
route without notice will be ``captured and-or destroyed.''
   The communique said the measure went into effect Tuesday in San
Martin department, where the main coca leaf-growing area in Peru -
the Upper Huallaga Valley - is located. Dozens of illegal airstrips
are scattered in the valley's dense jungle.
   The communique did not say how the airplanes would be tracked.
The military is not known to operate any radar stations in the
department.
   The threat represented what would be the air force's first move
toward taking part in anti-drug efforts. Peru is the world's main
source of coca leaf.
   The semi-processed coca leaf is flown mainly to Colombia, to the
north, where it is refined into pure cocaine.
   The U.S. Embassy in Lima said it had no comment on the
military's plan.
   Washington has been pressuring Peru's military to become more
involved in fighting drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga Valley.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Peruvian police
operate an anti-drug airbase in the valley, but the helicopters
that fly out of the base attack airstrips and drug laboratories.
   The United States offered to refurbish 20 Peruvian air force
planes to use against drug traffickers, as part of a 36
million-dollar military aid agreement, but in September President
Alberto Fujimori refused to sign the pact.
   He said at the time that more economic assistance must be tied
to the military aid to successfully combat drug trafficking.
   Army Gen. Mario Brito, head of the department's military forces,
told a Lima newspaper that three fighter planes are already
stationed in Tarapoto, a jungle city 380 miles north of Lima. He
said more airplanes would be moved to the area in the next few
weeks.
