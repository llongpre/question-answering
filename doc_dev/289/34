<F P=106> [Interview with General Jose Nadal Payva, the Peruvian Air </F>
Force, FAP, commander, by unidentified reporter; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [EXPRESO] Gen. Nadal, could you tell us how the FAP 
participates in drug enforcement actions? 
  Nadal: The FAP has been carrying out joint 
operations with the PNP [Peruvian National Police] since 1985, 
seeking to neutralize drug trafficking activities in Peru. 
  In 1981 we verified that traffickers and terrorists had 
formed an alliance. The FAP then began to operate from the 
Santa Lucia Base because illegal activities like that threaten 
national security. 
  Through Decree Law No. 25426 of 10 April 1991, and Decree 
Law 
No. 042-DE/FAP of 16 June 1992, the FAP was legally empowered to 
control all landing strips in Huallaga and other places where 
coca is grown. The FAP is thus responsible for destroying 
clandestine landing strips and for downing planes intercepted in 
Peruvian air space that refuse to obey orders to land. 
  To carry out its mission, the FAP uses its A-37, T-27, Y-12, 
and T-41 planes as well as gunships that can operate day and 
night. 
  EXPRESO: What are the results of these operations? 
  Nadal: Since 1991 the FAP has spotted, 
intercepted, captured and/or destroyed about 200 Peruvian and 
foreign aircraft that have violated the Civil Aviation Law 
and/or engaged in trafficking. More than $1.2 billion resulting 
from drug trafficking and 3.6 tonnes of cocaine paste have also 
been seized. 
  The FAP, the Peruvian Army, and the PNP have destroyed 
clandestine landing strips and cocaine paste laboratories in 
various areas including Caballococha and Puerto Maldonado. It 
should also be mentioned that more than 7,000 flight hours have 
been invested in enforcement operations. Considering our 
limitations, the balance of our participation is encouraging and 
positive, not just because of our achievements but also because 
of the high morale of our troops. 
  EXPRESO: What contribution is the FAP making to 
the current pacification process regarding the civic actions and 
social aide in general? 
  Nadal: The FAP has stepped up its participation, 
as far as civic actions and social aide is concerned, through 
the following activities: Granting free medical attention in 
clinical medicine, odontology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, 
pediatrics, gynecology, urology, cardiology, traumatology, 
pneumology, and various types of surgery, as well as medical 
evacuations, distribution of medicines, massive vaccination, and 
providing air transportation for civil personnel in emergency 
cases in outlying towns where the FAP has personnel stationed. 
  During this year the FAP has performed some 710 flight hours 
transporting to and from the interior approximately 15,500 
people and 100,000 kg of foodstuffs, clothing, equipment, and 
machinery necessary for the national pacification process in 
which the national government is engaged. 
  Moreover, we have organized and implemented youth clubs 
called "Los Aguiluchos" [Little Eagles] that involve 
approximately 1,500 children between 6 and 12 years of age who 
receive clothing, civilian-patriotic teachings, talks on the 
prevention of drug addiction and infectious diseases, remedial 
courses, sports, handicraft, and recreation. 
  This social assistance also reaches the parents with 
periodic 
conferences on subjects like "Responsible Parenthood" and "Child 
Psychology." 
  The FAP also facilitates communication free of charge for 
local inhabitants at certain hours of the day. 
  EXPRESO: You headed the Peruvian delegation to the 
latest International Air Fair in Chile. How does our FAP 
compared with the technological and scientific developments 
displayed there? 
  Nadal: The fair was visited by more than 900,000 
spectators where 31 countries exhibited their goods. The FAP 
used the opportunity to create a landmark in its relationship 
with the sister Latin American Air Forces by reasserting the 
well-known professional level of its personnel through a 
presentation, which was described as excellent both from the 
operative as well as technical viewpoint, operating M2000 
aircraft and state of the art technology. 
  The FAP Aircraft Maintenance Service (Seman) has proven that 
it is able to deal with high technology and that it provides FAP 
planes with excellent service. This can also be applied to 
other types of Peruvian or foreign aircraft.
