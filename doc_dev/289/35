<HEAD>Meese Tours Cocaine-producing Zone In Peruvian Jungle</HEAD>

   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III toured a
jungle valley Sunday that is the center of Peru's cocaine-producing
region.
   Meese arrived in Peru Saturday following visits to the Dominican
Republic, Colombia and Ecuador as part of a week-long tour of Latin
American nations to assess anti-drug trafficking operations.
   The attorney general, accompanied by U.S. and Peruvian
officials, flew from Lima to Tocache Sunday and toured the Huallaga
Valley before returning to the capital.
   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have been providing protection
for drug traffickers in the valley for the past year, and about 10
months ago the rebels briefly controlled Tocache before police
drove them out. Tocache is 300 miles northeast of Lima.
   The Huallaga Valley on the jungle-cloaked slopes of the eastern
Andes is the major coca-leaf growing area in Peru. U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration officials say Peru is the world's
largest supplier of the leaves, the raw ingredient of pure cocaine.
   From a helicopter, Meese viewed a three-acre pilot project to
erradicate the coca plants through the use of herbicides. If
successful, the method could replace the tedious system of
uprooting the plants. Both erradication efforts are being funded by
Washington, according the U.S. embassy.
   The United States also is partially financing police operations
against drug traffickers in the zone, and recently loaned Peru
three privately rented helicopters for drug raids.
   Coca leaf in Peru is semiprocessed and flown to Colombia where
it is refined into pure cocaine.
   Meese is to meet Monday with President Alan Garcia and hold a
news conference before flying to Bolivia, where his tour will
conclude Wednesday.
