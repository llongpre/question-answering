   About 300 Shining Path guerrillas attacked
an army patrol in their jungle camp in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga
Valley, killing at least six soldiers, police said Thursday.
   The 14 other soldiers in the patrol were missing, and police
think they fled into the jungle when their ammunition ran out. Army
helicopters failed to find them.
   In Lima, the capital, police said earlier Thursday that from
witness' descriptions, they identified one of the guerrillas
involved in the assassination of former Defense Minister Enrique
Lopez as Gregorio Olivos, a former university student with
purported links to the Shining Path.
   Lopez, the most prominent figure to be killed in 10 years of
guerrilla violence in Peru, was attacked in his car on Tuesday by
at least three men with sub-machine guns as he arrived at his
office in the Lima suburb of San Isidro.
   Another rebel group, the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, claimed responsibility Thursday, but a government
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the claim
``looks pretty thin. The attack ... has the Shining Path written
all over it.''
   On Wednesday evening, according to a police report, rebels
attacked the army patrol's camp in New San Martin area, 110 miles
south of Tarapoto.
   The battle lasted until Thursday morning, when the soldiers
apparently ran out of ammunition and the survivors fled, police
said.
   An army helicopter recovered the soldiers' bodies Thursday but
found no survivors. Nor did other helicopters dispatched to the
attack site.
   Police in Tarapoto, 435 miles north of Lima, told The Associated
Press that peasants living nearby informed them that the guerrillas
came to the area a few days before.
   The attackers had automatic weapons, grenades and dynamite. They
took the weapons and uniforms of the dead soldiers.
   The Upper Huallaga Valley is the source of most of Peru's coca.
The Shining Path operates there in an alliance with drug
traffickers, allowing them to do business with peasant coca-growers
in exchange for part of their profits.
   The traffickers buy coca leaves, make them into paste and ship
the paste in small planes north to Colombia, where it is refined
into cocaine.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in
political violence since the Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its
armed insurgency in 1980.
   A congressional commission said in Lima it will meet Friday to
hear testimony from the ministers of interior and defense on why
bodyguards were not accompanying Lopez when he was killed.
   President Alan Garcia criticized the military on the day of the
shooting for not providing full-time protection for the retired
general.
   An article published Thursday in the newspaper Cambio,
considered an outlet of the Tupac Amaru movement, said Lopez was
shot by their guerrillas in response to the government's ``politics
of annihilation (and) extrajudicial executions of guerrillas and
civilians.''
   Police say it was the Shining Path.
   They continued stopping cars and checking people's documents
Thursday in a search for suspects. A government spokesman said more
than 15,000 people without identification had been detained since
Tuesday, but most were released after proving their identity.
