   President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday he
would not sign an agreement with the United States for $35 million
in military aid to fight cocaine trafficking.
   Speaking at a press conference, Fujimori said Peruvian military
advisers ``consider it against our interests at this time'' to sign
the accord this year.
   The U.S. agreement was to have included $20 million to build a
training base near Peru's coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley and
provide arms and equipment for Peruvian soldiers.
   The Upper Huallaga is the world's principal supplier of coca
leaf, the raw material for cocaine. Political analaysts estimate
more than 1,000 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas operate in the
valley, a jungle region 250 miles northeast of Lima.
   The guerrillas provide protection for the drug traffickers in
exchange for money and weapons.
   The agreement had been drawn up by Washington and presented to
Fujimori's predecessor, Alan Garcia, who insisted the agreement be
accompanied by economic aid.
   Fujimori repeatedly warned he would not sign the agreement
unless it included economic aid to wean farmers from growing coca.
Fujimori stressed the need to develop alternative crops in the area
and build a paved highway to bring the products to markets on the
coast, where most of the populace lives.
   Fujimori said because the aid package ``is destined only for the
fight against drug trafficking, we are not going to sign this
agreement.''
   The aid package was planned for the 1990 fiscal year, which
concludes at the end of September. U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quaynton
said in an interview with the news magazine Caretas this week that
if Peru ``does not sign the agreement, the aid would go to other
countries.''
   The Peruvian military is more preoccupied with the country's
10-year guerrilla war than with controlling Peru's annual $1
billion cocaine trade. In Peru, the police force is in charge of
the drug fight.
   Peruvian politicians have criticised the agreement, fearing it
could lead to direct U.S. involvement in a guerrilla war that has
left nearly 20,000 dead since 1980.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already operates an
anti-drug base in the Huallaga Valley jointly with Peruvian police.
The Shining Path attacked the base in April.
   Fujimori's refusal to sign the agreement comes at a time when
Peru is reeling from tough austerity measures aimed at curbing
3,000 percent annual inflation.
   Fujimori, who was sworn in on July 28, inherited a moribund
economy and a huge government deficit generated by the freespending
government of Garcia.
   Fujimori is to travel to the United States at the end of
September for talks with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, according to the state news agency Andina.
   Quaynton said Fujimori may also meet with President Bush, Andina
said.
