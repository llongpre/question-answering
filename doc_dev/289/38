   Left-wing guerrillas have bombed U.S.-linked
agencies and Lima's largest synagogue in a wave of attacks
protesting American and Israeli policies in the Mideast. No one has
been seriously injured in the attacks.
   A bomb Wednesday night caused minor damage near the U.S.
ambassador's residence, police said, and another bomb at the North
American Cultural Institute slightly injured a bystander. Bombs
last weekend caused minor damage at the U.S. Consulate; a branch
office of Xerox Corp.; and the Peruvian Israelite Union Synagogue.
   A weekly newspaper close to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement said Thursday the attacks ``target Jews and Americans
engaged in the violation of human and national rights in the Middle
East.''
   The Jewish community in Peru is quite small, including 3,000 in
Lima, the country's capital and largest city. About 70 percent
belong to the Israelite Union congregation.
   Tupac Amaru is the smaller of two guerrilla groups operating in
Peru. Like the larger Shining Path, Tupac Amaru is
Marxist-Leninist. But the pro-Cuba group mainly has attacked U.S.
influence in Peru; Shining Path would like to recreate Peru along
the lines of the Chinese Communist revolution.
   Clashes between the army and the Shining Path left 11 dead
Wednesday in a coca-producing jungle area, military sources said.
Slain were an army captain, four soldiers and six rebels, the
sources said, speaking on condition they not be named.
   The battles took place about six miles south of Tingo Maria, the
main city in the Upper Huallaga Valley, about 200 miles northeast
of Lima.
   Drug traffickers in the area supply rebels with guns and money
in return for protection. The region provides over 60 percent of
the world's supply of coca leaf. The leaf is ground into paste and
flown to Colombia, where it is processed into cocaine.
   Political violence the past 10 years has claimed the lives of
more than 20,000 Peruvians, mostly civilians.
   An international organization of journalists met Thursday with
Defense Ministry officials and congressmen to denounce the murder
and harassment of dozens of Peruvian reporters.
   The Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists
delivered a report to Defense Ministry officials Thursday that said
15 journalists have been killed while doing their job the last
three years.
   In the same period, two journalists disappeared, 17 were beaten
and many others were threatened, the federation said.
   Soldiers and police are suspected in at least eight of the
killings and guerrillas are suspected in at least six. There are no
clear suspects in the other slaying, the federation's report said.
   Todd Smith, a reporter for the Tampa Tribune, is the only
foreign journalist named in the federation's report. Smith was
killed in November 1989 in Uchiza, in the Upper Huallaga Valley.
Drug traffickers, guerrillas and police have all been mentioned as
suspects in his death.
