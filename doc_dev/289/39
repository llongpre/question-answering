   An army patrol killed 14 Maoist rebels
in a battle in Peru's coca-producing Upper Huallaga valley, army
officials say.
   The fight took place Thursday afternoon near the village of
Morona, 20 miles north of Tingo Maria. One army officer was
wounded, according to the report.
   The fight began when a column of Shining Path guerrillas
ambushed an army patrol that was returning to its base in Tingo
Maria, 200 miles northeast of Lima, officials said Friday.
   Tingo Maria is the largest city in the Upper Huallaga valley,
where most of Peru's illegal coca crop is grown. The coca leaf is
used in making cocaine.
   The Shining Path gets money from drug traffickers who buy the
coca leaf from area farmers. Peru is the world's largest coca
producer.
   The guerrilla group launched its armed insurgency in the
southern highlands 10 years ago.
   One faction operating in the Ayacucho region, 235 miles
southeast of Lima, announced Thursday it was temporarily halting
attacks to ``evaluate'' its strategy. However, the announcement
appeared to come from a small splinter group as rebel attacks have
continued.
   The government says more than 18,000 people, mostly civilians,
have died in the decade of violence.
