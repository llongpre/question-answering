   Maoist guerrillas attacked a base built by the
U.S. government as a staging ground for anti-drug operations,
sparking a battle involving American civilians and Peruvian police,
U.S. officials said Thursday.
   No Americans or Peruvian police were killed or wounded in the
hour-long battle Saturday. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said base
personnel found no rebel bodies but that police believed several
dead rebels may have been carried off after the pre-dawn battle.
   He said between 40 and 60 guerrillas attacked the base with
small arms and grenade launchers.
   It was the first attack on the new $3 million base in Santa
Lucia, 265 northeast of Lima. The base is a staging ground for
anti-drug operations in Peru's coca-rich Upper Huallaga valley.
   The valley is a stronghold of the Maoist Shining Path rebels.
Drug smugglers pay the rebels to operate in the area.
   The guerrillas say they are defending the interests of peasant
coca farmers from abuses by drug traffickers and the police.
   The spokesman, who asked that his name not be used for security
reasons, said U.S. anti-drug personnel working in the area have
been fired on in the past, although this was the biggest attack to
date.
   Peruvian police sources said U.S. helicopters were called in to
repel a December guerrilla attack against a police post in Nuevo
Progresso, a town about six miles from the base. Embassy officials
denied the report at the time.
   An American pilot was wounded in the leg when his helicopter was
fired on during an operation in February 1989. That prompted the
withdrawal of U.S. personnel from the valley until the fortified
Santa Lucia base was finished in September.
   U.S. law prohibits American personnel or equipment from being
used against guerrillas except when they are attacked during
anti-drug operations.
   About 30 Americans have worked out of the base since September.
They include federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents and
civilian helicopter pilots and mechanics working for a private
company under contract to the U.S. State Department.
   Normally about 500 people are stationed there, including
Peruvian police rangers and civilian eradication workers. But the
embassy spokesman said only about 120 people were there Saturday
because many of the civilians had left to vote in Sunday's
presidential elections.
   He said police were tipped off to a possible attack Friday night
by people abandoning their homes in the small village of Santa
Lucia, just outside the base.
   Police were dispatched to patrol the area and spotted the rebel
column late Friday night.
   He said the guerrillas opened fired from across the Huallaga
River, which borders the base, but were too far away to be
effective. The river is about 100 yards across at that point.
   The base personnel responded with small arms fire, and two
helicopters piloted by Americans using night-vision goggles took
off and attacked the rebel positions, he said. Peruvian police
manned the M-60 machine guns aboard the helicopters.
   Ten UH-1H Huey helicopters belonging to the U.S. State
Department are on loan to the Peruvian police for use in anti-drug
operations.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected government in 1980 in the southern Andean highlands.
