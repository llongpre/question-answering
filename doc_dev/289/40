   Pro-Cuban guerrillas forced company helicopter
pilots to help them bomb installations of a subcontractor for the
American company Mobil Oil Corp. in a northern jungle region, a
leftist senator said Tuesday.
   Sen. Edmundo Murugarra said about 150 members of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement hit drilling operations Monday in the Upper
Huallaga River Valley.
   He said the rebels forced the pilots to fly over the site while
the guerrillas dynamited the installations from the air.
   The minister of energy and mines, Fernando Sanchez Albavera,
said Tuesday the attack caused $3 million in damage. He said it was
``important to stress Mobil's decision to continue to work in
Peru'' despite the raid.
   Mobil and U.S. Embassy officials refused to comment on the
attack.
   The Upper Huallaga is a coca-rich jungle area 200 miles
northeast of Lima. It also contains most of Peru's oil reserves.
   The valley produces more than 60 percent of the world's supply
of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   Hundreds of guerrillas from both of Peru's main rebel groups
operate in the area, providing protection for drug traffickers in
exchange for arms and cash.
   Tupac Amaru, a smaller and less dangerous rebel organization
than the Maoist-oriented Shining Path movement, started attacks in
1984.
   Guerrillas thought to belong to Shining Path on Tuesday tried to
assassinate a district attorney in Cuzco, 350 miles southeast of
Lima, police said.
   Cuzco, the ancient Inca capital and gateway to the Inca citadel
Machu Picchu, is one of Peru's principal tourist attractions. The
city has been relatively free of guerrilla attacks, except for a
car bomb three months ago.
   Shining Path rebels on Monday bombed state electricity company
offices in the northern mountain city of Huaraz, police said
Tuesday.
   Huaraz, 175 miles north of Lima, is a popular area for
backpackers and mountain climbers. Guerrilla violence has increased
in the area since the Shining Path killed a British backpacker
outside Huaraz in May 1989.
   More than 21,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.
