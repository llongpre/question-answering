   A clash in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga River
Valley has left 15 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas and two soldiers
dead, the army said Monday.
   The battle Friday was the latest in fighting that has left at
least 70 dead on both sides in the region the past week.
   In the central Andes, Shining Path rebels killed six members of
a local peasant defense unit 155 miles northeast of Huancayo,
police said Monday. Huancayo is a major central Andean city 120
miles east of Lima.
   In Lima, meanwhile, the newspaper Expreso reported Monday that
the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement had offered to lay
down its arms.
   The jungle ambush came two days after President Alberto Fujimori
rejected $36 million in U.S. military aid for Peru's armed forces
to fight drug trafficking.
   Fujimori had criticized the proposed military aid package,
saying military repression alone will not put an end to the coca
trade in the Upper Huallaga region.
   Hundreds of thousands of peasants grow coca in the valley.
Fujimori says economic aid is needed to develop the area and wean
farmers from coca.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already operates an
airbase jointly with Peruvian police in the Huallaga Valley.
   In Lima, Tupac Amaru leader Victor Polay, who escaped from
prison in July, offered to halt attacks if the government accepted
certain conditions, the newspaper Expreso reported.
   A man identifying himself as Polay called the newspaper and said
he he had made the offer in an interview with Interior Minister
Gen. Adolfo Alvarado.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman had no comment on the news
report.
   The Tupac Amaru group, which began operations in 1984, is a
smaller and less dangerous band than the Shining Path.
   Nearly 20,000 people have died in the 10 years since the Shining
Path took up arms. The majority of the victims have been civilians
caught in the crossfire between the rebels and the armed forces.
