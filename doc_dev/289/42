   This ramshackle jungle settlement has become
a boom town in Peru's illicit cocaine trade, luring thousands from
city shantytown or impoverished countryside with a promise of quick
fortune from the coca leaf.
   Pascual Mendieta came out of poverty in the village of La
Libertad three years ago, planted coca for awhile and now owns an
electronics store.
   Ten-year-old Daniel Aguilar was sent to Tocache by his mother to
shine shoes after his father died and now he earns enough money to
live on and send home.
   ``How am I going to deny I cultivate coca if it's growing all
around here as far as the eye can see,'' said David Buttgenbach, a
Peruvian of German descent who lost his job as a laborer when the
lumber company he worked for went bankrupt.
   ``Coca is paying for my six children to study in good schools in
Lima. Without coca my family would go hungry.''
   Landless peasants, the jobless from Lima, highland merchants,
Colombian drug dealers _ all have streamed into Tocache, swelling
its population from 10,000 in 1981 to 25,000 today.
   ``When I was working four years ago in a poor neighborhood in
Lima, you heard the name Tocache, Tocache, Tocache. Kids were coming
out here then to build airstrips for the drug traffickers,'' said
the Rev. Paul Feeley, a Canadian priest who now works in Aucayacu,
55 miles south of here.
   Operation Thunderbolt, a major police drive against cocaine
trafficking in the Upper Huallaga river valley in late 1987, put a
dent in the narcotics trade in Tocache. It forced the town's cocaine
boss, a gang leader known as ``The Vampire,'' to flee into the
jungle and dried up the flow of drug dollars. Sales in shops fell to
half their normal level.
   But the 250-man police force that seized control of Tocache from
an alliance of leftist guerrillas and cocaine smugglers has dwindled
to about 50 troopers today, and the town is regaining its gold-rush
atmosphere.
   New three- and four-story homes jut up against a backdrop of
jungled hills. Shops along Tocache's unpaved, muddy streets are
filled with color television sets, stereo systems and luxury items
like gold-plated lighters.
   The town's allure is reflected in a popular rock song, ``Going to
Tocache,'' which led Peru's top 10 musical hits for three months in
1988. Tocache's fame is such that Peruvians have coined a word,
``tocachization,'' to describe the explosive violence, corruption
and wild, lopsided prosperity of other jungle villages following in
its steps.
   Tocache once again is receiving a steady flow of
``narco-dollars'' from Colombian drug buyers who arrive in small
planes at clandestine runways in the jungle. The Colombians pick up
shipments of ``coca paste'' _ semi-refined cocaine made from the
leaves of coca bushes that cover mile after mile of hillsides in the
area.
   In Colombia the paste is refined into pure cocaine powder, which
is smuggled to the lucrative U.S. and European markets.
   The dollars to pay Peruvian coca farmers end up being trucked
over the Andes to a network of streetside money changers in Lima,
Peru's capital on the coast 300 miles to the southwest. Economists
estimate the cocaine trade pumps as much as $1.2 billion a year into
Peru's faltering economy, a sum equal to half the country's earnings
from legal exports.
   The appeal of ``narco-dollars'' has made Tocache and neighboring
settlements a promised land for some 200,000 peasants who have
migrated to the Upper Huallaga valley in the last two decades to
grow coca, a crop that pays 10 times as much as any other.
   It is illegal to grow coca in Peru without the permission of the
state coca company Enaco, which markets the leaves to drug companies
or distributes them for such uses as chewing and making tea. Enaco
says all of the coca in the Huallaga valley, where the vast majority
of Peru's coca leaf is cultivated, is illegal, but Peru lacks the
manpower, equipment and resources to stop it.
   The prosperity around Tocache is apparent even to the casual
observer. The jungle trails outside town pass house after house with
television antennas, refrigerators and gasoline generators for
power. Often motorcycles and four-wheel drive vehicles are parked
outside.
   Such acquisitions are luxuries in Peru, where most peasants
consider themselves fortunate to have a solid meal a day.
   Farmers are not the only ones to benefit from the coca bonanza.
   ``Everyone in this town, from the bigshot coca dealer to the
streetcorner ice cream vendor, lives off drug trafficking, either
directly or indirectly,'' says a police commander, speaking on
condition he not be identified by name.
   The sudden riches obtained by immigrants are resented by the
small number of townspeople who have not joined in the cocaine trade.
