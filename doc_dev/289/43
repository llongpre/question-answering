   The guerrillas now control large areas of the valley. They have
exploited resentment of the manual eradication program to win
support among peasants growing coca.
   Even more dangerous from the government's viewpoint is the
informal alliance that has developed between the rebels and the
local drug lords. U.S. officials, police and peasants say the
rebels are building up a multimillion-dollar war chest with
earnings from the drug trade.
   Counterinsurgency officials believe the explosive combination of
subversion and cocaine trafficking may have played a role in
Garcia's decision to allow the United States to begin testing
herbicides in the Upper Huallaga last October.
   Tests were begun with 30 herbicides. Eventually, U.S.
researchers concluded that Spike was the most effective and safest.
   Now they want to try aerial application of Spike in pellet form
to see how accurately planes can drop them on coca fields, most of
them smaller than an acre and interspersed with jungle. Spraying
has been ruled out because the liquid might be blown to surrounding
areas.
   U.S. officials say the aerial testing is ``on hold'' until the
U.S. government can resolve its dispute with Lilly. The company
announced in late May that because of ``a number of practical and
policy considerations'' it would not sell Spike for use in Peru
against coca.
   State department officials say that Lilly is worried about
reprisals from international drug traffickers and that the company
also fears lawsuits for any ecological damage.
   The company stands by Spike's safety if used as directed against
brush in grasslands in the U.S. West _ the purpose for which it was
designed _ but not as an herbicide against coca in Peru's jungle.
   A pamphlet distributed with the herbicide warns that it will
kill trees and shrubs if their roots come in contact with it.
   ``The problem is that Spike is not designed specifically for
coca,'' says Edgar Machado, an agronomy professor at the National
Agrarian University in Lima and Peru's leading expert on coca.
   ``Any broadleaf plant that comes in contact with Spike is going
to die, and broadleaf plants make up 98 percent of the jungle. The
exposed soil will be washed away by the valley's torrential rains.
The erosion will be terrible,'' Machado says.
   But U.S. Embassy officials argue that the Upper Huallaga is
already being destroyed by the cocaine industry and the only way to
save it for future agricultural use is to wipe out coca
cultivation. ``That's not a pristine jungle out there,'' Watson
says.
   Studies by Peruvian experts say that more than 1.7 million acres
of tropical forest have been destroyed by peasants clearing land
since the coca boom began in the 1970s.
   A flight over the valley seems to bear this out. From the air,
parts of the region look as though they have been bombed. Hill
after hill is peeled of vegetation. Millions of fallen tree trunks
present a picture of devastation.
   At least 150 rivers in the Upper Huallaga Valley have suffered
perhaps irreparable damage from chemicals used to process cocaine
paste in jungle labs. Many species of fish already have
disappeared, according to a study by Buenaventura Marcelo, a
professor at the National Agrarian University.
   Since 1970, cocaine paste producers have dumped millions of
gallons of sulfuric acid, acetone and other toxic chemicals into
streams that flow into the Amazon, Marcelo says, creating ``a grave
threat to the survival of the region's rich aquatic resources.''
   Although the debate on the use of a potent herbicide has
centered on ecological damage, Peru's government must also consider
the economic and social consequences of destroying illegal coca
cultivation.
   U.S. drug experts estimate that cocaine trafficking generates at
least $700 million annually for Peru, a sum equal to nearly 30
percent of the country's legal export earnings.
   With Peru mired in its worst economic troubles of the century,
many Peruvians wonder whether the country can afford to wipe out
coca cultivation.
   ``If this bankrupt nation has dollars circulating on the
streets, it is because of drug trafficking,'' Machado says. ``It is
not in anyone's interest to kill the goose that lays the golden
eggs.''
   Some 200,000 peasants have migrated to the Upper Huallaga Valley
in the past two decades to grow coca because they can earn 10 times
as much from it as from other crops.
   Some government officials believe that if coca is eradicated in
the Upper Huallaga without a program to help the peasants, they
will migrate elsewhere, cut down more trees and plant more coca.
That would also create resentment that the Shining Path would be
quick to exploit.
   In San Pedro, a cluster of a dozen shacks alongside a dirt
airstrip lost in the jungle 60 miles north of Tingo Maria, Guzman
Tamamuro already is bitter toward the government.
   As he watched police troopers burn a small pile of his drying
coca leaves, Tamamuro said:
   ``I'm just a poor man trying to feed my family. They think all
of us are big `cocaleros.' But they are wrong. Why don't they just
burn us up with the coca and be done with it?''
