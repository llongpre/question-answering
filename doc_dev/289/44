   A small U.S. plane used in Peru's anti-drug
effort crashed in the Andes mountains, killing the six Americans
and three Peruvians aboard, officials said Sunday.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Loveridge said the plane went
down Saturday afternoon, after it had left the jungle town of Tingo
Maria. He said the wreckage was spotted Sunday morning.
   Loveridge refused to provide the names of the passengers. But he
said the dead Americans included a DEA agent, two helicopter
pilots, the plane's pilot, a mechanic and a security officer from
the embassy.
   In Washington, Maurice Hill, a DEA public information officer,
identified the dead DEA agent as Rick Finley, 36, of Ft. Knox, Ky.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yovera said all nine on the
single-engine plane died. He said the three Peruvians were a police
captain, the 8-year-old son of a police commander and the chief of
the U.S.-funded coca eradication program.
   Yovera said the U.S. plane was flown by an American contract
pilot, and Hill said it was owned by the U.S. State Department's
International Narcotics Matters Bureau.
   Yovera said there was no indication of what had caused the
crash, but he discounted sabotage because of strict security
controls.
   American personnel in two Peruvian military helicopters from
Lima were recovering the bodies Sunday, Yovera said. The effort had
been suspended Sunday night until the morning, Loveridge said.
   Yovera said the plane crashed in a remote area on the arid
western slopes of the Andes, 65 miles northeast of Lima.
   Loveridge said rescue teams aboard helicopters had spotted the
plane's wreckage and burned bodies scattered nearby. He said the
plane was destroyed when it apparently slammed into a mountainside
15,000 feet above sea level and the largest piece visible from the
air was the engine.
   Loveridge said the last contact with the plane was when the
aircraft passed over Huanuco, 185 miles northeast of Lima.
   Tingo Maria is 240 miles northeast of the capital in the lush
Upper Huallaga river valley, a jungle-cloaked region on the eastern
slopes of the Andes.
   The valley is the world's greatest source of coca leaf, the raw
material for cocaine. The U.S. government has assigned several
dozen agents to work with Peruvian anti-drug police in campaigns
against drug traffickers in the violent region.
   In addition to the plane, the U.S. government has supplied nine
helicopters to Peru for the anti-drug fight and has contracted
private American pilots and technicians, many of them Vietnam War
veterans, to fly the aircraft.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group controls much of
the valley and works hand in hand with drug traffickers, police and
U.S. officials say.
