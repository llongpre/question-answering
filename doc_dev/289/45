   The presidents of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia,
where the illegal cocaine trade has its roots, invited President
Bush on Tuesday to attend a drug summit within 90 days. He accepted
immediately.
   In a brief communique at the end of a five-hour meeting on a
common anti-drug strategy, the leaders said European leaders also
should take part in the summit, to be held in Latin America. They
pledged to continue ``all-out war'' on drug trafficking.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``The
president will go.'' He said 90 days was ``within the time frame we
have been considering. It's reasonable.''
   In their communique, Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru, Virgilio
Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia said both the
production and consumption of cocaine must be addressed.
   The statement appeared to reflect Latin American concern over
Bush's emphasis on police and military actions against the trade.
   Garcia, Barco and Paz suggested details of the summit be worked
out at a meeting Nov. 20 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, of lower-level
officials.
   Fitzwater said the United States had no objection to
participation by Europeans and security concerns would not stand in
the way of a summit. Of a planning meeting Nov. 20, he said: ``I'm
sure that's fine with us.''
   Garcia has been promoting inclusion of European nations as
active participants in a war against the cocaine traffic. If the
United States is successful in slowing the flow of cocaine over its
borders, he says, smugglers will shift their focus to Europe.
   The Peruvian president read the communique to hundreds of
reporters gathered in Ica for the closed-door summit, but did not
answer questions.
   A battalion of 300 soldiers guarded the Las Dunas Hotel, site of
the meeting, and 3,000 plainclothes policemen circulated in this
desert city of 350,000 people 185 miles southeast of Lima.
   Heavy security was ordered in case of attacks by the Shining
Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that has fought Peruvian governments
since 1980 and works with traffickers in Peru's Upper Huallaga
Valley, source of more than 60 percent of the world's coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine.
   A bomb exploded before dawn Tuesday in Trujillo, a northern city
where five Latin American foreign ministers were meeting to prepare
the agenda for a summit of the Group of Eight countries that begins
Wednesday in Ica.
   It went off at the offices of a public housing agency, damaging
the building but causing no injuries. Police said no group claimed
responsibility.
   Ica suffered two brief blackouts Tuesday morning, but officials
said technical problems caused them, not sabotage.
   Peru, Colombia and Bolivia have said military-style repression
of the drug trade should be accompanied by more U.S. economic aid
to provide alternative crops or sources of income for the hundreds
of thousands of peasants who grow coca.
   Barco began a crackdown on Colombian cocaine barons Aug. 19 and
has received $65 million worth of U.S. military aid to help in the
effort.
   Garcia has been especially vocal on what he considers the
limitations of the Bush plan, which includes $261 million for the
three countries, mainly in the form of weapons.
   ``If Peru's Huallaga Valley produces 60 percent of the coca
leaf, how is it possible the Peruvian government is assigned $60
million when $8 billion is to be spent on the fight within the
United States?'' he asked foreign reporters last week. ``This
doesn't seem serious to me.''
   Peru and Bolivia produce more than 90 percent of the world's
coca. Colombian drug cartels turn semi-refined coca paste from the
two countries into pure cocaine and smuggle it to the United States
and Europe.
   Hundreds of thousands of peasants in Peru and Bolivia live by
growing coca. Officials of both countries say there is little hope
of eradicating the crop unless the growers have another way of
making a living.
   Colombia says it needs stable world prices for coffee, its main
legal export. Otherwise, the Colombians say, the cocaine-dependent
economy could collapse if the war against drug trafficking was
successful.
   ``It's not a problem of donating some helicopters, sometimes
very old helicopters, or donating rifles or bullets,'' Garcia said.
``It would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranteed market
for the products that could substitute for coca.''
   Peru has an added worry because of support the Shining Path has
among the peasants who grow coca. The rebels protect the peasants
against a U.S.-financed coca eradication program, in return
collecting a ``tax'' of 10 to 15 percent of their earnings.
   Peruvian officials fear Shining Path ranks will expand swiftly
if the government succeeds in reducing the cocaine trade without
providing alternate sources of income to peasants.
   ``We have a double problem in the Huallaga Valley _ coca
cultivation and subversion,'' Garcia said. ``Unless coca
substitution is gradual, all we will acheive is to make poor
peasants even poorer and push them into the arms of the subversive
movement.''
