  [Text] The farmers in the northern Upper Huallaga (San 
Martin Department) who left that region after the brutal attacks 
by the Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] are gradually but with determination returning to 
their land. The people living in that region agree that what is 
taking place now in that part of the country is the best result 
of the pacification policy. 
  When subversion entered the Upper Huallaga region a few 
years 
ago--about the mid-1980's--mainly in some provinces of San 
Martin Department, thousands of farmers and peasants had to 
leave their farms or land to settle in the nearby cities or, in 
the worst cases, to settle in the capital. 
  Subversion now has been practically eliminated and the 
people 
have returned, not with the intention of continuing to grow 
coca, which is the raw material for the sinister narco-terrorist 
alliance, but to grow other types of products that are more 
profitable and can be exported. 
  For example, in 1992 rice growing in Tarapoto reached 12,000 
hectares and so far this year the cultivation of this product 
has already reached 30,000 hectares. It is expected that 50,000 
hectares of rice will be grown by the end of this year. 
  The situation of the corn crop is also the same. Although 
the 
quality of corn is not the best, efforts are being made to 
improve it to the exportable type required by the important and 
demanding world markets. 
  But despite this limitation, Tarapoto's corn is wanted by 
countries like Germany, which wants to buy 80,000 metric tons 
even though this year's production is only expected to reach 
20,000 metric tons. 
  This is why agricultural land is being prepared in order to 
increase corn production considerably next year. 
  General Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros, general commander of the 
Huallaga Front, said: ``The farmers welcome the intentions of 
foreign importers.'' 
  Regarding fruits, grape production is giving good 
results--it 
is being used for making wine and marmalade and sales are good. 
  A Peruvian farmer said: ``In Cumbaza we have rich land with 
good production. Although the grape harvest is only once a year, 
we have two harvests here.'' 
  Gen. Rodriguez said: ``We are gradually making progress in 
replacing coca, and the price of coca has dropped considerably 
in all of San Martin Department.'' 
  As an effective complement to this situation in the northern 
Upper Huallaga, antidrug operations are eradicating cocaine base 
although not definitively. 
  The work by the Air Police Directorate providing air support 
to National Antidrug Division (Dinandro) patrols, and sometimes 
to the Army, is ``suffocating'' the drug traffickers still 
operating in the region. 
  An Air Police Directorate officer said: ``Ninety percent of 
the antidrug operations are carried out through the use of 
helicopters, and our unit is the only that can carry out this 
type of operation.'' 
  Although the people who live in the areas where drug 
traffickers operate protected by the wild jungle of San Martin 
reject the police action because the people in some way also 
live off this activity, the ``blows'' have been hard and more 
drug traffickers had to leave for other regions, where a 
struggle also is being carried out against them. 
  An Air Police pilot said: ``We carried out several 
interdiction operations in the last few weeks; an area is hit 
after confidential information is received. We seized precursors 
and drugs, and many people involved in this activity were 
arrested.'' 
  The struggle against drug trafficking probably will take 
some 
time but much less than the struggle against terrorism. But the 
police operating in the area need more sophisticated equipment 
to face this social scourge in a more effective manner.
