   Peru's new president says Washington can keep
the millions in military aid it's offering to step up the war on
cocaine trafficking. He wants cash to get farmers to stop growing
coca and for highway construction so alternate crops can make it to
market.
   Because the aid package ``is destined only for the fight against
drug trafficking, we are not going to sign this agreement,''
President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday night.
   His statement appeared to torpedo any hope his 6-week-old
government will accept the $35.9 million in military aid Washington
is offering this year to fight the cocaine trade.
   Peru could use the money. The country is reeling from the
effects of tough austerity measures aimed at curbing 3,000 percent
annual inflation.
   The government is also battling a 10-year-old insurgency by
Maoist-inspired rebels, who have allied themselves with cocaine
traffickers in return for money and arms.
   Fujimori has warned on several occasions that he would not sign
the military aid agreement with the United States unless it
included economic aid to wean farmers away from growing coca, from
which cocaine is produced.
   He has also said Peru needs help in developing alternative crops
and in building a paved highway from regions where coca is now king
so the produce can reach coastal markets.
   The rejected U.S. aid package was to finance the construction of
a training base near the coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley. It also
included $20 million to build a training camp and provide weapons
and equipment for Peruvian soldiers.
   The Upper Huallaga is the world's main supplier of coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine. More than 1,000 Shining Path
guerrillas are estimated to operate in the valley, a jungle region
250 miles northeast of Lima.
   Many Peruvian politicians had expressed fear that the aid
package could lead to direct U.S. participation in a guerrilla war
that has claimed nearly 20,000 lives.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already operates an
anti-drug base in the Huallaga Valley with Peruvian police. The
Shining Path attacked the base in April and engaged U.S. pilots in
a shootout. No casualties were reported.
   On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quaynton did sign two
agreements for $400,000 with the interior minister, Gen. Adolfo
Alvarado.
   The agreements will provide vehicles and motorcycles for the
police to help combat drug trafficking and they appear to represent
the continuation of U.S. anti-drug aid to the police.
   However, Washington has as yet been unable to get the army
involved in the drug war, and through it, assume an increased role
in the guerrilla war.
   The larger aid package would have involved the army, which is
more worried about defeating the Shining Path than with controlling
Peru's annual $1 billion cocaine trade.
   The military was interested in the aid to fight guerrillas but
did not wish to tie it to the anti-drug fight. It questioned the
wording of the proposed agreement, which directly linked any aid to
controlling the cocaine trade.
   Washington's aid package was originally presented to Fujimori's
predecessor, Alan Garcia, who insisted it be accompanied by
economic aid.
   The Bush administration had planned the aid package for the 1990
fiscal year, which concludes at the end of September. Ambassador
Quaynton said in an interview with newsmagazine Caretas this week
that if Peru ``does not sign the agreement, the aid would go to
other countries.''
   Fujimori, who was sworn in on July 28, inherited a moribund
economy and a massive government deficit generated by the
free-spending government of Garcia.
   He has called off plans to travel to the United States at the
end of September for talks with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, according to the state news agency Andina.
   Fujimori said his ``presence is important at this time, while
the economic stabilization program is in full flow.''
   Andina had previously quoted Quaynton as hinting that Fujimori
might also meet with President Bush.
