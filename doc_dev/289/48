   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A valley in Peru that is the world's largest
single source of coca leaf is the focus of the latest strategy in
the United States' faltering war against the cocaine trade.
American authorities want to eradicate the coca plants with a
powerful herbicide. But that plan is meeting a lot of resistance,
for economic as well as environmental reasons.

   Smoke from burning jungle obscures the
sky above Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, cradle of the world's
cocaine trade and site of a much-debated U.S. experiment to stamp
it out with a powerful herbicide.
   From a police helicopter flying over the valley, thousands of
bright green fields of coca, the raw material of cocaine, are
visible through the haze. The plots, the labor of tens of thousands
of peasants who have burned off the hillsides, stand out clearly
against the dark mat of surrounding tropical foliage.
   Also visible from the air are dozens of illegal landing strips
cut into the jungle to accommodate the small planes that daily pick
up shipments of semi-refined cocaine for final processing in
neighboring Colombia.
   The Upper Huallaga Valley stretches 150 miles north of this
ramshackle town, located on the jungle-draped eastern slopes of the
Andes Mountains, 230 miles northeast of Lima.
   The valley is the world's largest single source of coca leaf. As
such it is the focus of the latest strategy in the United States'
faltering war against the cocaine trade.
   The U.S. government is testing Tebuthiuron, an herbicide known
commercially as Spike, against coca bushes in a one-acre plot on a
steep valley slope. Preliminary results show the chemical to be
deadly against the tough coca plant. Aerial application is to be
tried next.
   If that proves effective and if the U.S. government can resolve
a dispute with the herbicide's producer, Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis, about the safety of the chemical, the first program
of large-scale eradication of coca plants could follow.
   ``Ten years ago I wouldn't have said this, but interdiction
alone will not stop the flow of cocaine into the United States,''
says Craig Chretien, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's operation in Peru.
   American officials have sought to reassure Peruvians of the
safety of Spike, citing studies that indicate the herbicide is less
toxic to humans than aspirin.
   But both Peruvian and foreign environmental advocates are
warning that the use of a strong herbicide in the fragile jungle
eco-system is a dangerous gamble.
   They fear its long-term consequences and some predict the
destruction of all plant life in a region of great agricultural
potential already ravaged by the cocaine industry.
   Critics also contend that the Spike project is politically
motivated _ that the Reagan administration is seeking
``spectacular'' results in the drive against cocaine during an
election year, with little regard for the ecological implications.
   ``The questions raised by persons concerned about the impact on
the environment are perfectly legitimate. That's what we're trying
to determine with testing locally,'' U.S. Ambassador Alexander
Watson said in a recent meeting with American correspondents.
   In neighboring Bolivia, which with Peru accounts for more than
90 percent of the world's coca leaf production, Foreign Minister
Guillermo Bedregal has said his country will not be a ``guinea
pig'' for experimentation with toxic herbicides.
   But the center-left government of President Alan Garcia, in dire
need of U.S. economic aid, has indicated its willingness to attempt
herbicide eradication in Peru if it is convinced the herbicide is
not harmful to other plants, animals and human beings.
   ``The Peruvian government is willing to use herbicides and is
going to use them. They are the only weapon we have left against
drug traffickers,'' says a senior official in Peru's anti-drug
effort, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.
   Cultivation of coca in Peru has soared dramatically from 40,000
acres in 1974 to between 250,000 and 400,000 acres today.
   The increase has come despite a 5-year-old American-financed
manual eradication program. U.S. officials say manual eradication
of plants is too slow and too dangerous because workers are exposed
to attacks by the hired gunmen of the drug barons and by Maoist
Shining Path rebels who prowl the valley.
   Thirty-four members of eradication teams have been killed in
recent years, and in 1987 the 460 workers in the program pulled up
only 876 acres of plants.
   The 3-year-old Garcia administration has tried to disrupt the
marketing network of Peruvian and Colombian drug organizations. But
American drug officials, while praising Peru's commitment, say the
efforts have been frustrated by the far greater resources of the
cocaine lords.
   Since 1985, a special anti-narcotics police force has
confiscated nearly 100 tons of semi-refined cocaine paste, burned
770 crude jungle labs for producing paste, and dynamited more than
170 clandestine airstrips, according to Gen. Juan Zarate, head of
the narcotics unit.
   But the drug gangs have quickly repaired the dirt runways, often
within 24 hours, using well-paid work crews of local villagers and
sometimes even earth-moving tractors, Zarate said in an interview.
   The campaign against cocaine ran into a new obstacle since the
fanatical Shining Path guerrillas extended their presence in the
Upper Huallaga Valley in early 1987.
