   Twenty decapitated bodies have been found
floating in a river near a jungle camp used by U.S. anti-drug agents
but the grim discovery will not affect the base's operations, a U.S.
Embassy spokesman said Friday.
   The headless cadavers, also without hands and feet, were seen in
the Huallaga River near the U.S.-built base at Santa Lucia, 270
miles northeast of Lima.
   Gene Bigler, U.S. Embassy spokesman, said agents of the U.S. Drug
Endorcement Administration and Peruvian police began launching
anti-drug operations from the new base Thursday. He said there were
no plans to withdraw U.S. personnel because of the bodies.
   Bigler would not say how many agents and contract pilots had
moved into the base or give details on the operations.
   The DEA pulled out of the Huallaga Valley in February after a
contract helicopter pilot was wounded in the leg by a bullet.
   ``The discovery of bodies in the jungle is not a great novelty,''
Bigler said. ``We're fully aware that there is a threat and we make
every effort to protect our people.
   ``It's a war and there is a risk.''
   Peru's armed forces are battling Maoist Shining Path guerrillas
who often work in alliance with drug traffickers in the Upper
Huallaga river valley, one of the world's largest sources of coca
leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   The army launched an offensive against the guerrillas in the
Upper Huallaga Valley in July and since then some villagers have
claimed civilians disappeared after being detained by troops.
   Military authorities in Lima said they had received no report on
the cadavers.
   Bigler said it was not known who the victims were but, ``Because
of the removal of the hands, there's speculation they may be
traffickers.''
   He said removing the hands would make identification of the
bodies difficult, but he did not elbaorate.
   Bigler said the bodies had been seen ``at the beginning of this
week'' and not on Thursday as a DEA spokesman in Washington reported.
   The DEA spokesman, Frank Shults, said Friday, ``We have no idea
if this was meant to be a signal to anybody, to what purpose and to
whom. There was no note, no messenger, no nothing. No one knows what
to make of it.''
   He added, ``It was an unfriendly message, to be sure.''
   The embassy spokesman said the bodies apparently were seen over a
period of several days.
   An Associated Press reporter who visited the region last week was
told by a village official in La Morada, 15 miles upstream from the
Santa Lucia base, that decapitated bodies were seen shortly after
army troops took away 18 villagers for questioning on Aug. 19.
   ``On Monday, an old woman saw two headless bodies beside the
trail to the river,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified out of fear for his life. ``The next day three bodies
without heads came by in the river and on Wednesday five more
bodies.''
   Army units have been blamed for the deaths of numerous civilians
in counterinsurgency campaigns in the mountainous region of Ayacucho
southeast of Lima where the Shining Path began its revolt in 1980.
   In August, London-based Amnesty International issued a report
accusing Peru's security forces of massive human rights violations
in the fight against leftist rebels.
   It said a ``pall of terror'' had settled over much of Peru
because of violence by both the rebels and government forces.
   Assassinations and sabotage by the guerrillas has been met with
abductions, torture and killings of suspects by security forces, the
organization said.
