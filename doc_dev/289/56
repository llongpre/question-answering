  [Text] Since February 1978, when the government promulgated 
the first national antinarcotics law, the antinarcotics struggle 
in the country has been characterized by its isolated efforts 
and meager results. 
  At the end of the 1970's, farmed coca production did not 
surpass 30,000 hectares. Last year it surpassed 150,000 
hectares according to the Ofecod [Executive Office for Drug 
Control], which is under the jurisdiction of the Interior 
Ministry. Some less conservative statistics suggest the total 
is about 300,000 hectares. 
  U.S. sources have stated that during the period 1978 to 
1993, 
drug trafficking activities which were previously concentrated 
in the Upper Huallaga Valley expanded at the national level. 
Some 200,000 families now farm coca and manufacture cocaine 
paste. Drug-related activities generate an income of about $2 
billion per year within the Peruvian economy. 
  Many experts believe the failure of the antidrug struggle 
follows the lack of an antidrug strategy and the absence of an 
organization to plan, coordinate and implement it. 
  The national drug prevention and drug control plan seeks to 
resolve one of the most vulnerable points of the antidrug 
struggle in the country by establishing an organization to 
centralize all government efforts in this field. 
  The General Law on Drugs foresaw in 1978 the need to 
establish an organization to draft a drug control policy, to 
implement it and to coordinate all the actions to be developed. 
  Law No. 22095 established the Multi-Sectorial Drug Control 
Committee (Comucod) [Comite Multisectorial de Control de 
Drogas], an organization to approve the government's antidrug 
policy; and the Ofecod, an executive and coordinating 
organization. Under the law, Comucod was to comprise six 
cabinet members and an alternate from the Supreme Court. The 
truth is that Comucod did not fulfill the duties with which it 
was entrusted by law and never really worked. 
  Ofecod came under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. 
It was to have controlled drugs, and implemented and 
coordinated government actions. As it turned out, Ofecod 
handled administrative functions of disposing of the goods 
seized by the police during antidrug operations and ignored the 
other duties with which it was entrusted by law. 
  Experts believe neither of these organizations completely 
fulfilled its duties. This, undoubtedly, directly influenced 
the expansion of coca farming and trafficking at the national 
level. 
  The lack of leadership, and the dilution and ineffectiveness 
of government actions in the antidrug struggle, became obvious 
in the early 1980's. 
  The main institutions involved in the drug control program 
at 
the time were: the National Coca Enterprise, (Enaco); the Upper 
Huallaga Coca Control and Reduction Agency (Corah); and the 
Upper Huallaga Development Program (Peah). 
  Enaco was the government organization responsible for the 
monopoly, legal marketing, and industrialization of coca. In 
fact, it only captured an insignificant part of Peru's coca 
harvest which was mainly being grown for drug traffickers. 
  Corah, which was entrusted with coca eradication programs in 
the area, eliminated several hundred thousand hectares of coca 
in the Upper Huallaga region but paradoxically the valley became 
the main coca producing region in the world. 
  Peah, which was responsible for promoting alternative 
farming 
programs in coca producing regions, yielded insufficient results 
and enjoyed little support among coca farmers. 
  Some experts said the failure of these government 
organizations to control coca farming and trafficking lies in 
the fact that trafficking is merely considered a criminal 
activity that must be disciplined with police repression and 
severe legal punishments. 
  For a long time the antinarcotics struggle was only based on 
repressive actions. The police were the main organization 
entrusted with conducting these repressive actions through its 
diverse specialized units--among them the Mobile Rural Patrol 
Unit (Umopar), which was involved in the compulsory eradication 
of thousands of hectares of coca; the former Drug Police 
Division (Dipog); the Illicit Drug Traffic Investigative 
Division (Dintid); the Antidrug Division (Dirandro), which later 
became the Antidrug Division (Dinandro). 
  Even today repressive actions are still prevalent. The 
number of actions has risen since July 1992 when the government 
established the Internal Operations Front Command (COFI) which 
falls under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces. This is the 
top organization, responsible for the planning, implementation, 
and control of the struggle against drugs and terrorism. 
  In the last few years, in addition to repression, the 
authorities have introduced the strategy of alternative 
development. This program seeks to replace economies based on 
coca farming with the alternative farming of legal crops and an 
improvement in the standard of life in coca-producing regions. 
  The Peruvian Government has acknowledged the prevalence of 
the economic and social problems that encourage trafficking. It 
paid particular attention to alternative farming but its results 
in practice have been almost nil. Neither the Institute for 
Alternative Development (Idea), nor the Autonomous Authority for 
Alternative Development (Aada) were ever implemented. 
Considering the antidrug draft bill grants ``the highest 
priority'' to the alternative development program, there are 
great expectations that this time around, this program will 
finally be implemented.
