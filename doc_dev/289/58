   Police teams worked Monday to recover the
bodies of six U.S. narcotics employees and three Peruvians killed
in a weekend plane crash in the Andes, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yovera said there was no
indication of what caused the crash Saturday that killed all
aboard, but he discounted sabotage because of tight security
controls.
   The bodies were brought down to Vichaycocha, a remote village on
the arid western slopes of the Andes, said U.S. Embassy spokesman
Charles Loveridge. Peruvian military helicopters carrying U.S.
personnel were meeting them there.
   The single-engine Cessna Caravan crashed Saturday afternoon
against a 15,000-foot-high peak in the Andes, 65 miles northeast of
Lima by air.
   The plane, owned by the U.S. State Department's International
Narcotics Matters Bureau, was en route to Lima from the jungle town
of Tingo Maria, 240 miles northeast of the capital.
   Officials said the three Peruvians were Hugo Samanez, director
of a U.S.-funded coca eradication program; a police captain and the
8-year-old son of a police commander.
   Loveridge said the dead Americans included an agent with the
Drug Enforcement Agency, two helicopter pilots, a helicopter
mechanic, the plane's pilot and a security expert contracted by the
State Department.
   In Washington Maurice Hill, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, identified the DEA agent as Rick
Finley, 36, of Ft. Knox, Ky.
   Loveridge identified the other Americans as John Knapp, the
plane's pilot; Billy McDonald and Dennis Eisler, helicopter pilots;
John Van Zandt, a helicopter mechanic, and Clyde Bayless, a
security expert contracted by the State Department.
   He said he had no hometowns or ages for the five.
   U.S. teams also are investigating the crash, the first incident
in which American narcotics agents were reported killed in Peru in
the campaign against cocaine trafficking.
   Tingo Maria is 240 miles northeast of the capital in the lush
Upper Huallaga river valley, a rain-drenched region on the eastern
slopes of the Andes that is the world's greatest source of coca
leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   The U.S. government has assigned several dozen agents to work
with Peruvian anti-drug police in campaigns against narcotics
traffickers in the violent region.
   The fanatical, Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group
controls much of the valley and works hand in hand with drug
traffickers, police and U.S. officials say.
