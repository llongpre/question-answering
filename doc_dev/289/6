   In a hit-and-run raid, police rangers
flown in by U.S. helicopters and accompanied by a U.S. adviser blew
up an airstrip used by cocaine smugglers in an eastern jungle.
   Monday's raid was witnessed by the first reporters allowed onto a
new U.S.-built anti-narcotics base in Santa Lucia since it began
operating Sept. 8 beside the Huallaga River in the heart of Peru's
coca-producing region.
   Anti-drug police in four Huey helicopters flown by American
contract pilots swooped in on a 1,500-yard dirt airstrip carved into
the jungle a hundred yards from the Huallaga.
   The rangers quickly set off plastic explosives that left two
craters 20 feet in diameter and 12 feet deep in the runway. Within
10 minutes the helicopters were airborne again.
   ``Speed is the key to safety. We have to come in quickly and get
out quickly,'' said Gen. Juan Zarate, chief of the national
anti-drug police force, who led the group.
   He was referring to the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who
dominate the Upper Huallaga valley and provide protection to coca
farmers and drug trafficking gangs in return for cash.
   The four Hueys used in the raid, along with four others on loan
to Peru, are armed with M-60 machine guns and carry gunners at the
door on alert for attack from the jungle.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents usually accompany the
police rangers on raids but only one was spotted in Monday's attack
and reporters were not allowed to talk to him.
   The burly agent, dressed in jungle fatigues and carrying an
assault rifle, looked on as police troopers exploded the charges on
the landing strip. He wore a handkerchief over his face to hide his
identity while photos were taken.
   The heavily fortified garrison in Santa Lucia is the centerpiece
of the U.S. government's increasingly militarized campaign against
the drug trade in Peru, which produces nearly 70 percent of the
world's coca leaf, the source of cocaine.
   The anti-drug base, 150 miles northeast of the capital Lima,
eventually will contain at least 300 police troopers. They will
receive training and air support from up to 50 Americans, including
DEA agents and contracted pilots.
   President Bush recently announced $261 million for military and
police-action aid to fight cocaine trafficking in Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia. The three countries this year received $57 million.
   After blowing up the airstrip, the airborne rangers continued on
to a cocaine base lab discovered Friday in a bamboo forest near the
village of Ramal de Aspuzana and later dynamited and burned by
police.
   As Zarate showed journalists around the dynamited buildings, he
pointed out destroyed barrels and dryers that he said turned out 660
pouds of cocaine base a week worth $1.2 million.
   Cocaine base, the final refining stage before pure cocaine, and
coca paste, a more elementary stage, are sold to Colombian drug
smugglers who arrive at dozens of airstrips scattered through the
highland jungle of the Huallaga Valley.
   The Colombian cartels turn the paste and base into pure cocaine
and smuggle it to the United States and Europe.
   About 200 police rangers have begun operating out of the Santa
Lucia base and have destroyed seven laboratories in five days,
Zarate said.
   Bulldozers at the base were still working Monday on the airstrip,
now 1,800 yards long but designed to reach 2,500 yards _ big enough
to handle jumbo C-130 cargo planes.
   Guard towers 30 feet high provide a view out over the river and
the jungle, which has been cut back hundreds of yards from the
perimeter of the base.
   Six-foot-high sandbag barricades protect four helicopter pads.
The base, not including the airstrip, covers 100 acres and is closed
in by barbed wire. The outlying area is mined.
   ``The Shining Path is going to lose hundreds of men if it tries
to attack this base,'' said a U.S. official involved in the war
against the cocaine trade.
