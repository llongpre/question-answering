   The army killed 20 Shining Path guerrillas in
two raids in the coca-growing jungle region northeast of the
capital, the government said Saturday.
   One soldier was wounded in the operation, carried out Thursday
with ground troops and helicopters in the state of Huanuco,
according to the report.
   The state of Huanuco encompasses most of the Upper Huallaga
Valley, the world's richest coca-growing region. The government has
said the Shining Path operates in league with drug traffickers in
the area, allowing them to move their products in exchange for cash.
   In the first rebel encounter, an army patrol surprised a camp of
70 guerrillas near La Morada, 185 miles northeast of Lima, killing
15 rebels.
   The army, with helicopter support, then attacked another camp in
the area, killing five rebels, officials said.
   President Alan Garcia has said the threat of ``radical and
violent communism'' is greater in Peru than anywhere else in Latin
America.
   The Shining Path, a Mao-inspired group started by a Marxist
university professor in the early 1970s, took up arms against Peru's
elected government in 1980.
   The insurgency began in the highland state of Ayacucho, 235 miles
southeast of Lima, but has spread through most of the highlands and
northern jungle regions.
   The government has said nearly 15,000 people have died in the
9-year-old uprising, including soldiers, police, guerrillas and
government officials. Most of the dead, however, have been peasants
killed in the cross fire between the army and the rebels.
