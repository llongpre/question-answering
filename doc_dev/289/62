   A combined force of leftist guerrillas and
drug traffickers overran a jungle police post in the heart of
Peru's cocaine region, killing 10 officers and wounding 12,
military officials reported Tuesday.
   The attack at dusk Monday was among the bloodiest of recent
months. Officials said it may have been a response to U.S.-financed
testing of a powerful herbicide against coca, the raw material of
cocaine.
   Premier Armando Villanueva and Defense Minister Enrique Lopez
flew to Uchiza, site of the attack 245 miles northeast of Lima, on
Tuesday, the government news agency Andina reported. Officials said
more than 100 soldiers and police troopers were sent to the town as
reinforcements.
   In June 1987, drug traffickers and Maoist guerrillas of the
Shining Path destroyed the police post at Uchiza in the cocaine
country of Peru's Huallaga Valley. Six policemen were killed in
that raid.
   Shining Path guerrillas has provided protection to drug
traffickers for about two years in exchange for arms and money.
They began their insurgency in 1980, in the region around Ayachuco
in the Andes.
   Military officials said 150 rebels and drug-runners attacked the
50-man post Monday with gunfire and grenades. They said surviving
defenders fled into the surrounding jungle.
   Six attackers were slain and their companions carried the bodies
away, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
   They said telephone connections with Uchiza were cut and word of
the attack reached Lima hours later by radio, still with sketchy
details.
   Ten days ago the U.S. and Peruvian governments began a second
phase of tests of the herbacide Tebuthiuron, sold under the name
Spike, in the Huallaga Valley, which produces about 60 percent of
the world's coca.
   Environmentalists say the chemical could destroy other plants
and lead to widespread erosion. Officials said tests on 40 acres
would track the herbicide's effects on coca and the environment
over at least a year.
   Coca produced in the Uchiza region is partially processed in
jungle laboratories and flown from clandestine airstrips to
Colombia, where it is refined into cocaine for sale in U.S. and
European markets.
