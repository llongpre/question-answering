   American drug agents have resumed raids on
cocaine traffickers in Peru's jungle despite reported conflicts
with the military, the U.S. Embassy said Wednesday.
   Army sources, meanwhile, denied that soldiers had interfered in
American enforcement operations in the area.
   U.S. DEA agents are attacking ``any target that arises,'' an
embassy spokesman said. Bad weather and vacations for the holidays
are keeping the number of helicopter raids below normal levels, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Drug Enforcement Administation chief Robert Bonner said Tuesday
in Washington that agents had suspended operations in the Upper
Huallaga Valley because of interference by Peruvian armed forces.
   The DEA and Peruvian police operate a helicopter base in the
valley, the world's main source of coca leaf, the raw material for
cocaine. The valley is also a center of operations by Peru's two
leftist rebel groups.
   The Washington Post on Wednesday reported the State Department
is considering removing Peru from the list of countries cooperating
with U.S. anti-drug efforts.
   Removing Peru from the list would require the United States to
cut off most of its aid to Peru. It would also require Washington
to oppose loans to Peru by the International Monetary Fund and
other multinational institutions.
   Presidential and Foreign Ministry officials said Wednesday they
had no comment on Bonner's statements.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman denied the armed forces had ever
interfered with DEA operations. The spokesman said relations
between the army and the anti-drug police are ``normal.''
   The Interior Ministry is in charge of Peruvian police forces.
After taking office July 28, Fujimori appointed active army
officers to most top posts in the ministry.
   An army officer at the Military Joint Command also denied that
soldiers had hindered DEA raids in the Huallaga.
   ``If anything, it is the DEA that is interfering with army
operations in the zone,'' said the officer without elaborating. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States and Peru's armed forces have often clashed
over anti-drug strategy in the Huallaga.
   Peruvian officers have made clear they regard the guerrillas as
a much greater threat than the drug traffickers. Political violence
the past 10 years has claimed nearly 20,000 lives.
   The military believes anti-drug operations in the valley could
push local peasants into the rebel ranks. Some 200,000 Peruvians
are thought to be involved in growing and processing coca.
   The rebels provide protection to the drug traffickers in
exchange for guns and money, police and peasants in the area say.
   In 1989, U.S. officials accused the army general in charge of
anti-rebel operations in the Huallaga of allowing drug traffickers
to operate in the region. The general was later transferred.
   In September, Fujimori refused to accept $36 million in U.S.
military aid to fight drug trafficking. He said Peru needs more
economic aid to help the peasants who grow coca leaves.
