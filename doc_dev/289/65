  [Text] Three Colombian and one Peruvian drug trafficking 
rings (involving the Cachique Rivera brothers) were using the 
landing strip in "El Diamante" native community in the town of 
Boca del Manu, Madre de Dios Department, when a large 
consignment of drugs was seized on 26 February. 
  The three Colombian "firms" are headed by Colombians known 
as 
"Pablo" or "Pablito," "Caballo," and "Duro." 
  The Peruvian organization is headed by the Cachique Rivera 
brothers. 
  The shipment of 3,653 kg of washed cocaine paste, wrapped in 
75 bags, was seized in the aforementioned location. 
  The drug had been stockpiled in underground "caches" in the 
jungle near the 1,800-meter landing strip of "El Diamante," 
ready to be loaded into small planes bound for Colombia. 
  The route currently used by the Colombian "narcopilots" 
includes Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Brazilian airspace and the 
city of Cruzeiro, near Ucayali, are used by Colombian mafia 
organizations to ship the drugs to Colombia. 
  The "traffickers" take this route to elude the Yurimaguas 
radar and the possibility of being pursued by the Peruvian Air 
Force T-27 planes that patrol Peruvian airspace in Upper 
Huallaga. 
  Intelligence sources have shown that traffickers have moved 
to areas like Apurimac Department and the jungle edges in 
Ayacucho, Pasco, Cusco, and Madre de Dios Departments because of 
the interdiction activities by the Peruvian forces of order. 
  Traffickers take the drug, which is stockpiled in the 
production areas in Upper Huallaga, Aguaytia, Ucayali, Pozuzo, 
Pichis Palcazu, Oxapampa (Pasco Department) and Palmapampa 
(Ayacucho Department), to shipment areas where it is worth more. 
  Air, land, and river transportation are used to reach the 
shipment "points." 
  From the shipment areas -- one of which was "El Diamante," 
Boca del Manu, in Madre de Dios Department -- the drugs are 
taken to Colombia aboard small Colombian planes. 
  The 13 traffickers detained on 26 February during a combined 
operation were interrogated yesterday by the Counternarcotic 
Division (Dinandro) of the Peruvian National Police.
