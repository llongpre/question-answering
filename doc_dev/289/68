<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez, from the "Investigative Unit"] </F>
  [Text] A report issued by the Interior Ministry General 
Intelligence Directorate (Digimin) last February states that the 
arrest and imprisonment of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, 
aka "Vaticano" has not curtailed drug trafficking activities. 
  The document states that the creation of new drug stocking 
and dispatch centers, and the transference of drug "firms" to 
new areas is due to the repressive action of the security forces. 
  The report states that Colombian Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias, 
aka "El Ministro," and the Cachique Rivera brothers from Huanuco 
have occupied the void left by "Vaticano" by increasing their 
operations. 
  "Vaticano's" organizations have not been totally dismantled 
because they are now controlled by his brother Elias Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka "Cristo." 
  The Digimin report states: "Even though `Vaticano' was 
sentenced to life imprisonment, trafficking increased in Peru 
demonstrating that the organizations and `firms' involved in 
this illegal activity can modify their procedures and change 
their areas of action to avoid being detected." The report was 
distributed to the Armed Forces Joint Command, the National 
Intelligence Service, the Navy, Army, and Air Force Intelligence 
Directorates, and other agencies. 
  The main areas to where the traffickers have moved to avoid 
enforcement actions and to resume their businesses are the 
Tambopata Basin in Madre de Dios, on the border with Brazil, and 
in the northeastern jungle, specifically in Loreto and Ucayali. 
  According to the Digimin document, the "firms" that are 
massively installed in Tambopata Basin use Cusco peasants "to 
transport coca from the Amparaes and Lares valleys (Calca 
Province), Huaros (Quispicanchis Provinces), and Quillabamba (La 
Convencion Province), on a `small scale' basis, by land (road 
and rail) to Juliaca (Puno)." 
  The same "firms" which have turned Boca Manu into one of its 
operations center also collect coca from the higher zones of 
Puno. These leaves "are allegedly processed in maceration pits 
in riverside areas in these provinces and in inaccessible zones 
of Juliaca, where basic and washed coca paste as well as cocaine 
hydrochloride are allegedly being manufactured. This drug is 
then transported by land and sold for consumption in Cusco, 
Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Ica, and Lima as well as in Argentina 
and Chile." 
  The presence of trafficking gangs in the Tambopata Basin, 
Loreto, and other places that will be mentioned later is due to 
the combined action of the Army, National Police, and the DEA in 
Upper Huallaga. 
  Experts warned that the implementation of antinarcotics 
policies based on repression would scatter the "firms" but not 
destroy them. 
  Interior Ministry analysts also acknowledge this, admitting 
that the mafias in Madre de Dios mostly come from the Upper 
Huallaga and Ucayali, especially from Aguaytia and particularly 
from Tambopata River Basin "given its geographical location and 
scarce" police and military "control." 
  The same point of view is expressed in the conclusions of 
the 
document which states: "The pressure exerted by the forces of 
order has caused trafficking activity to (...) move further 
away." 
  Madre de Dios is now "the main stocking center of basic and 
washed coca paste produced in northeastern Peru, as are Cusco 
and Puno, from where it is then transported abroad (to Brazil 
and Colombia)." 
  The "firms" have also moved to the Maranon River Basin from 
the Upper Mayo Valley in San Martin Department, from where they 
send drugs to Chiclayo, Trujillo, Piura, and Tumbes through 
Chiclayo, Olmos, Jaen, Bagua, Rioja, and Moyobamba. 
  The report states that "coca paste production was observed 
to 
have increased gradually there as well as greater stocking in 
Nueva Cajamarca (Rioja and Moyobamba). This increase is 
reflected both in the domestic market (small scale trade) and 
abroad (transported to Ecuador)." 
  The trade, transportation, and manufacturing of drugs has 
increased in these areas, particularly in Celendin, Cajamarca, 
and Luya, Amazon Department, "where Colombian and other foreign 
small planes are observed in the airport of Luya which is 
allegedly the export shipment center." 
  The organization left by "Vaticano," which is now controlled 
by his brother Elias Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Cristo," is 
allegedly protected by the Shining Path in the Huallaga River 
Basin. 
  The document adds that the "firms" have increased their 
operational levels in Ucayali, especially in Ayatala and Padre 
Abad Provinces and in the towns of Tamaya and Pachitea where 
basic and washed coca paste are manufactured to then transfer it 
to Pichis Palcazu from where it allegedly is transported to 
Brazil. 
  Recent antinarcotic operations in Pichis Palcazu forced the 
"firms" out toward Zona Balta, Puerto Esperanza, and San 
Bernardo, in Puros Province, Ucayali. 
  Just two weeks ago, LA REPUBLICA published a report on 
activities in the Pichis Palcazu valley. We discovered that the 
area had been turned into a new operations center by traffickers 
who previously operated in Upper Huallaga. 
  Regarding the Apurimac-Ene Basin, the document says: "Coca 
producing peasants in the Ene and Perene River valleys, in 
Satipo Province, Junin, and Pichis Palcazu-Oxampampa Province, 
in Pasco; as well as peasants from the Apurimac River valleys in 
Huanta and La Mar Provinces, Ayacucho, and Conception Province, 
in Cusco, have increased their plantations. In these zones 
traffickers have involved coca producers in their illegal trade. 
Peasants now build maceration pits near rivers and are 
manufacturing basic and washed coca paste." 
  The drug that is produced here, with that sent from 
Huallaga, 
is traded in Palmapampa in the Apurimac valley. This is the 
"main collection center. From here drugs for domestic 
consumption are distributed by land to the capital and other 
important cities (Huancayo, Pisco, Ica, Arequipa, Cusco) and 
shipped toward the Colombian and Brazilian borders by air." 
  Clandestine strips for shipping drugs have been fully 
identified in Luisiana, Palmapampa, Palestina, Puerto Mayo, 
Valle Esmeralda, and Iscozazin. 
  Digimin analysts said there are Army and Air Force bases 
near 
the clandestine strips of Luisiana and Palmapampa but the other 
strips are not controlled at all. 
  Trafficking activities have increased in the so-called 
central axis--comprising roads leading to Lima and the main 
coastal, central, and southern cities--particularly in Ica. 
  One of the projections being handled by Digimin is that 
"trafficking organizations will try to counter their recent 
setbacks by creating new centers of collection and shipping, 
thus spreading the police coverage and reducing their 
efficiency." 
  Another option being analyzed by experts is that 
"trafficking 
organizations, due to the quality of the coca in Huallaga, will 
continue to evade police controls by transporting the drug by 
land or by river to areas outside the control of the forces of 
order and close to airstrips that have been abandoned or are not 
controlled. Here the drug can be manufactured and shipped 
abroad." 
  The document does not specify the amount of drugs 
transported 
by the "firms," the number of drug flights, or the number of 
military or police personnel who cooperate with traffickers. 
  The report says, however, that interdiction has increased 
sharply. During February the police seized 186 kg of cocaine, 
3,713 kg of washed coca paste, and 8 kg of cocaine and arrested 
245 individuals in 119 operations, most of them in the Maranon 
basin. 
  The antinarcotic forces are now seeking to capture and 
disable the organizations headed by Waldo Vargas Arias and the 
Cachique Rivera brothers. 
  "(Vaticano's) capture has left a gap which his main 
competitors, `El Ministro' and the Cachique Rivera brothers, are 
seeking to exploit," the report states. 
  Both "firms" work for the powerful Cali cartel, which is 
responsible for 80 percent of the drugs entering the United 
States. 
  The police have hit the Cachique Rivera group the hardest: 
Five houses in Lima were raided, four laboratories were 
destroyed, and 15 accomplices were arrested. Just one month ago 
Antinarcotics Directorate officials captured Margarita Cachique 
Rivera--the "firm's" contact with foreign buyers in Lima and who 
guaranteed the supply of precursors to elaboration centers in 
the jungle. 
  "El Ministro" once again escaped from a combined police, 
Army, and DEA operation in Lagunas, Loreto Department, during 
March: He has an airstrip in the area.
