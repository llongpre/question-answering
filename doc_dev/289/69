   Leftist guerrillas from a group allied with
drug traffickers ambushed two trucks carrying soldiers and
civilians in the northeastern jungle, and 30 people were killed,
police said Monday.
   In other attacks, leftist Shining Path rebels killed three
council members Monday in Munani, a village 615 miles southeast of
Lima, and two peasants in Chongos Bajos, a hamlet 140 miles east of
the capital.
   The attacks Monday and the ambush Sunday, also blamed on Shining
Path fighters, continued a wave of violence that has already killed
215 people this month.
   It is one of the heaviest periods of violence since the
Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its insurgency in 1980. More
than 15,000 people have been killed in Peru's political violence.
   Police said 17 civilians, including women and children, 10
guerrillas and three soldiers were killed Sunday when the rebels
burst out from the jungle along the road and ambushed the trucks
near Tocache, a town 260 miles northeast of Lima.
   The three dead soldiers included a lieutenant in command of the
military patrol riding in the trucks.
   The police report did not provide details. New reports said most
of the rebels were killed when army troops aboard helicopters came
to help the ambushed patrol.
   Tocache is in the Upper Huallaga Valley in Peru's highland
jungle. More than 60 percent of the world's coca crop, used to make
cocaine, is grown in the region.
   Colombian drug buyers aboard small planes fly into dozens of
illegal airstrips in the area to pick up semi-refined cocaine,
which is later turned into pure cocaine in Colombia and smuggled to
the United States and Europe.
   U.S. narcotics officials and police say the Shining Path rebels
provide protection to coca farmers and drug-trafficking gangs in
return for a share of their profits.
