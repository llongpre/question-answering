   The United States plans to build a training
base where U.S. soldiers will instruct the Peruvian army in jungle
warfare to fight leftist rebels, a U.S. Embassy official said
Saturday.
   The new base will be built in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga
valley as part of a $35 million U.S. military aid package. The aid
is one of several U.S. measures as part of President Bush's
strategy announced in September to fight the flow of drugs from
Andean nations.
   ``We've been building the pipeline and now its starting to
flow,'' said a U.S. Embassy spokesman. For security reasons, he
spoke on condition his name not be used.
   Bush asked Congress for $2.2 billion over five years to help
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru fight drug trafficking. The package
apparently will come from $47 million approved for fiscal 1990 by
Congress for anti-drug efforts in Peru.
   Plans call for U.S. military personnel to train five Peruvian
army battalions and one navy battalion that currently operate in
the Huallaga valley, the spokesman said. He gave no figure for the
number of U.S. personnel to be involved.
   The base is to be built near the anti-drug base at Santa Lucia,
250 miles north of Lima in the jungle, he said. That base has been
the staging ground for interdiction operations involving Peruvian
police and U.S. drug agents against smugglers in the valley.
   The base was attacked April 7 be a large column of Shining Path
guerrillas. No one on the base was wounded, but a number of the
rebels were believed killed.
   The pre-dawn attack was repelled by two U.S. helicopters armed
with M-60 machine guns and flown by American contract pilots. It
was the first time any of the 10 State Department UH-1H helicopters
on loan to Peru for drug operations were directly involved in a
battle with the rebels.
   The spokesman said the two bases will be able to support each
other in case of rebel attack.
   ``We think that this will increase the capacity to deal with
large subversive movements in the area,'' he said.
   The $35 million will also pay for weapons, communications
equipment and uniforms for the six battalions, which will be
rotated through the base in small groups, the official said.
   ``They will be provided basic counterinsurgency training to
improve field effectiveness and efficiency in dealing with Sendero
Luminoso in the valley,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Sendero Luminoso'' is the Spanish name for the Shining Path
rebels, a Maoist-inspired group that operates in league with drug
traffickers in the Upper Huallaga valley.
   U.S. officials have said the U.S.-sponsored drug fight has been
ineffective in Peru because of the lack of security in the valley.
The Bush Administration has insisted development aid for the area,
such as crop substitution programs, be predicated on improved
security against leftist guerrillas.
   Other aspects of the new program call for the United States to
provide river boats to the Peruvian navy to use in patrolling the
extensive river systems in Peru's eastern jungles.
   Much of the chemicals used in the cocaine-making process come
into the country from Colombia and Brazil by way of the many Amazon
tributaries along the borders. They are also used to carry the drug
out of the country.
   The program also calls for the United States to refurbish about
20 A-37 attack jets belonging to the Peruvian air force. They will
be used to provide air support in the fight against the Shining
Path.
   The spokesman said the training base would be built and
operating within a few months. He said plans for three other bases
being discussed by U.S. and Peruvian officials.
   The announcement of the new program comes as Peruvians await the
second round of presidential elections between Mario Vargas Llosa
and Alberto Fujimori. Both candidates have said they would allow
U.S. military personnel to come to Peru for training purposes.
   About a dozen Green Berets are training Peruvian police in
jungle warfare at a base in Mazamari, 180 miles east of Lima.
