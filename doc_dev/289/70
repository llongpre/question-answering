  [Text] Of the 10 Bell-212 helicopters donated by the U.S. 
State Department to the National Police for interdiction 
operations against drug trafficking in the Peruvian jungle, five 
are broken down in Pucallpa. National Police sources provided 
this information. They indicated that antinarcotics operations 
in the Upper Huallaga as well as in the mountain ranges of the 
central jungle have been temporarily suspended because of a lack 
of these helicopters. 
  Experts in the struggle against drug trafficking said the 
helicopters are a great help in transporting police personnel, 
as land transportation is very difficult in the jungle due to 
ambushes by narcoterrorists. A spokesman for the National Police 
said that despite this inconvenience, operations are carried 
out, but not as many.
