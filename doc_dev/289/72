   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has
reduced its operations in Peru's cocaine-producing jungle for
security reasons, U.S. officials said.
   The cutback began two months ago after the security chief of the
U.S. Embassy received a minor leg wound in January by gunmen firing
at a U.S. helicopter from the ground, said embassy spokesman
Charles Loveridge.
   The violence occurred in the Upper Huallaga valley near Tingo
Maria, 240 miles northeast of Lima. Officials say more than 60
percent of the world's coca, the raw material of cocaine, is grown
in the region.
   Operation Snowcap, under which DEA agents advise Peru's Civil
Guard on eradicating coca fields and cocaine-producing
laboratories, was suspended in mid-February, said Catherine Shaw of
the department's office of International Narcotics Matters in
Washington.
   ``They're regrouping, looking for ways to make the base camp
more secure,'' she said.
   The United States has been slowly building up its anti-drug
force in the region the last two years, but violence stemming from
an alliance between drug traffickers and Maoist Shining Path
guerrillas has recently increased security risks, U.S. officials
said.
   Loveridge said the United States was temporarily halting its
coca eradication program and interdiction efforts to allow time to
analyze the effectiveness of the anti-drug effort.
   He declined to say exactly how many U.S. officials have been
withdrawn but said about 12 still are stationed in the region.
   ``It certainly is not an end to our efforts. We will be out
there and fighting drugs for a long time to come,'' Loveridge said.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said in Washington the
decision does not mean a reduction in the number of U.S. agents in
Peru, only a reassignment.
   ``There are other kinds of work that can be done down there,
such as intelligence, that sort of thing,'' he said.
   Loveridge said construction is continuing on a fortified
helicopter base near Tingo Maria and U.S. agents are continuing to
train and advise Peruvian police in anti-drug operations.
   Nine U.S. helicopters, rented from private companies and loaned
to the Peruvian government, are still in operation in the region,
Loveridge said.
   Ms. Shaw, who said she was not aware of any particular threats
against the agents, added, ``There have been, over the years, many
threats against the eradication workers.''
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., disclosed the suspension
Wednesday at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
crime, which he chairs.
