Roads in the South"] 
  [Text] On 9 February the U.S. Government disclosed part of 
its new antidrug strategy. It stressed the importance of 
treatment and prevention of drugs at home, as well as 
alternative economic development and strengthening of the 
institutions charged with combating drug trafficking abroad. 
  In theory, and regarding the international component of the 
new strategy, there seems to be a change of course. Robert 
Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for international 
drug trafficking affairs, has said that while in the past a 
special effort was made to intercept and seize drug shipments 
destined for the United States, the current plan is aimed at 
cocaine-producing countries, combining eradication of coca 
plants with self-sustained development. 
  In principle it sounds good. The only catch is that this is 
the strategy's publicity portion. During the past few years the 
drug trafficking issue has been at the core of relations between 
Washington and Latin America. In its development this issue has 
been defined by the White House as a national security problem 
and in fact has gradually become a threat to the internal and 
external security of the rest of the area's countries. 
  During the two most recent Republican administrations 
(Reagan- Bush) the concept of "drug trafficking" occupied the 
central spot in the new sociological language on drugs. Stress 
was put on the external nature of this "malignant" problem. The 
core of the problem was thought to consist of narcotics 
trafficking and transportation. 
  In other words, the danger was thought to stem from the 
supply, which the Reagan-Bush administrations regarded as a 
threat to U.S. social and even institutional structures. 
  Since the first Reagan administration, political-strategic 
logic ruled out the drug phenomenon's economic and commercial 
rationale. In the cause-effect diagnosis, ideology replaced 
pragmatism. With the hobbyhorse of "morals," the emphasis on 
solutions was expressed in words like "combat, war, and 
crusade." The Pentagon said it was necessary to combat the 
problem "at its origin" -- production and processing centers -- 
with highly coercive and repressive methods. 
  This argument, which failed to underline the importance of 
demand as the cause of the supply -- and which therefore 
concealed the situation's commercial and financial reality -- 
evidently had a political objective, that is to say, to transfer 
the cost of the fight to the producing countries. 
  Roughly, this has been the story of the failed "war on 
drugs" 
of the past three Republican administrations, with three 
additions. Drugs have also invaded a very specific area -- 
counterinsurgency. 
  Pentagon and Department of State publicity fanned the notion 
of "narcoterrorism" in the framework of a counterinsurgency 
policy, which has to do with the new standard that the U.S. 
Department of State seeks to impose on the subcontinent at the 
end of the Cold War. 
  During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the most 
prominent U.S. proposal to the Latin American drug-producing 
countries was to create a coercive regional counternarcotics 
force, with extraterritorial jurisdiction which could operate 
without the limitations imposed by sovereignty at local borders. 
  In view of the "coca for development" Andean strategy -- 
encouraged by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Bolivian 
President Jaime Paz Zamora -- Washington implemented a policy 
stressing military aspects. 
  Bush, both president of the world's largest 
narcotics-consuming country and the epitome of contradiction, 
avoided facing the problem at home and pressed to mobilize the 
Armed Forces of the "drug countries" into carrying out 
essentially police tasks. 
  In addition, the Pentagon succeeded in establishing some 
posts in area countries, particularly Peru and Colombia. Two 
examples are Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga in 
a Peruvian coca- producing zone controlled by the Shining Path, 
and a base in Leticia, Colombia in the Amazon area of the border 
with Peru, where 500 U.S. soldiers are stationed. 
  Although Bill Clinton's speech now emphasizes the antidrug 
struggle at home and the budget allocation for the external 
front has been reduced, part of what he failed to say when he 
explained his strategy makes it possible to conjecture that the 
new president will continue to apply some of the former policy's 
central components through the militarization of producing 
countries. 
  It is no mere chance that there are U. S. military engineers 
in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Guatemala in the framework of 
the "Caminos del Sur/94" exercise. 
  Their alleged tasks hint at the nature of their specific 
assignments, such as training in Guatemala, training and radar 
site installation in Colombia, and participation in the local 
fight against drugs in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia. These are 
functions usually assigned to the police. 
  In reality, the Pentagon has spent a great deal of time and 
money on these actions and has succeeded in involving the CIA 
and DEA. 
  For this reason, we can assume that President Clinton was 
carried away by the momentum of the circumstances. While he says 
one thing in his speeches, in practice he follows and improves 
on previous strategies in Latin American countries.
