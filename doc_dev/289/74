   Maoist guerrillas killed two farm co-op
officials in the highlands and killed two police rangers in an
ambush in a cocaine-trafficking jungle region, police said Sunday.
   The two police troopers died in an ambush along a jungle trail
before dawn Friday near Uchiza, a town 250 miles north of the
capital Lima in the heart of the Huallaga Valley, center of Peru's
illegal cocaine trade.
   Police said two other rangers were missing after the clash and
feared dead.
   The Huallaga Valley is the source of the coca used to produce
most of the cocaine that enters the United States. The coca is
partially refined into cocaine and smuggled in small planes to
Colombia, where it is purified.
   Police say the Shining Path has entered into a deadly alliance
with drug traffickers to provide them with protection in return for
money and guns.
   In other violence 10 hooded rebels seized an isolated farm
cooperative Wednesday night near Cajabamba, a town in the mountains
300 miles northwest of Lima, and fatally shot the co-op's president
and another official, police said.
   Counterinsurgency police, meanwhile, interrogated an Irish
priest and a West German aid worker detained with four Peruvian
women on suspicion of involvement with the fanatical Shining Path
guerrilla movement.
   Police identified the men as the Rev. Charles Gallaguer, an
Irish priest assigned to a parish in Lima, and Rainer Ulhe, a West
German citizen working with a Catholic Church-supported aid
foundation.
   The hometowns and ages of the men were not available.
   They were detained Saturday night in Ayacucho, the highland city
that is the stronghold of the Shining Path. Police also arrested
three church social workers and a woman who is vice president of an
Ayacucho human rights group.
   The six were detained after they returned from a visit to a jail
in Huanta, a town 20 miles north of Ayacucho, which is located high
in the Andes 230 miles southeast of Lima.
   The Shining Path launched its insurgency in Ayacucho in May 1980
after 10 years of clandestine political work in the surrounding
countryside. Since then the violence has spread through much of the
country and claimed more than 10,000 lives.
