   About 300 leftist rebels stormed the
jungle town of Saposoa, freed 35 suspected guerrillas and drug
traffickers and robbed its three banks, police said Tuesday.
   One civilian was killed by a stray bullet and two policemen were
wounded in the ensuing three-hour battle between police and rebels
belonging to the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru movement, police said.
   Ten policemen were also captured by the guerrillas and tried in
a ``people's court'' in the main plaza of Saposoa. The 10, stripped
to their underwear, were freed at the request of the townspeople.
   Saposoa is 60 miles southeast of Tarapoto, the biggest town in
the Huallaga Valley, and 340 miles north of Lima.
   The 35 freed prisoners had been convicted of drug trafficking or
guerrilla activities, police said. Two other prisoners, each with
less than a month to serve, chose to stay behind in the jail.
   Police said the rebels had guns and carried five shoulder-held
anti-aircraft missiles. Police and military in the region often use
helicopter gunships in their battles with guerrillas and drug
traffickers.
   Before leaving Saposoa, the rebels destroyed the police post and
distributed 300 sacks of government rice to residents. The rebels
also robbed the town's three banks, stole four trucks and headed
south out of town, police said.
   The Tupac Amaru group began operating in Lima in 1984 and
concentrated its attacks on U.S. installations and organizations
they accused of exploitation of the poor.
   The rebels later began fighting in the Huallaga Valley, but were
quickly suppressed by the army. Small columns have continued to
operate in the jungle but have not carried out major attacks.
   The valley is the world's main source of coca leaves, the raw
material for cocaine. The rebel group and the larger
Maoist-inspired Shinning Path guerrillas receive weapons and money
from drug dealers and in return allow them to operate freely in the
region.
   In September the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the
Peruvian police began operating an anti-drug airbase in the
Huallaga Valley. The U.S. government is also seeking Peru's
approval to set up a camp in the area to train Peruvian soldiers in
anti-guerrilla warfare.
