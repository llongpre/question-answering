  [Text] The Shining Path (SL) terrorist group--once 
described as the most lethal and bloody terrorist group in the 
world--is in the final throes of its alliance with drug 
traffickers. The harsh and devastating blows it has received at 
the hands of the forces of order over the last couple of months 
have considerably undermined its criminal activities in the 
Peruvian jungle. 
  In the Huallaga Front, where most clashes are taking place, 
the Armed Forces and the Peruvian National Police [PNP] have 
separated terrorism from narcotrafficking by attacking it to 
such an extent that any possibility of a future alliance is 
almost nonexistent. The Aries offensive is no coincidence. The 
military command has information on subversive movements in the 
Cuchara region. 
  This military offensive compelled the SL people's guerrilla 
army--the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Army] is almost 
totally annihilated--to desperately take refuge south of the 
Upper Huallaga region while drug traffickers headed north of 
Ayacucho and more recently to Madre de Dios where the Army and 
the PNP are dealing with them harshly. 
  In the Cuchara and Primavera regions--where the Aries 
operation is being conducted--SL commanders are being severely 
questioned by their subordinates who, in view of the 
intensification of military actions, are taking advantage of the 
Repentance Law. 
  These desertions are prompting SL commanders to 
indiscriminately kill any SL member who disobeys orders. 
  Carlos, a 13-year-old boy who escaped with his father from 
the theater of opeations, said: "SL members are killing each 
other because they do not know what to do in the jungle any 
more." 
  This can only be interpreted as a desperate move by the SL 
commanders, who interpret these "rebellions" as the end of their 
Maoist ideology. The Ashasninkas indigenous group are taking 
advantage of this situation and escaping the long and ruthless 
captivity they have endured at the hands of SL. 
  Eight SL terrorists, among them little Carlos, who endured 
the most deplorable living conditions imposed by the SL 
commanders, surrendered five weeks ago at the Quiteni 
antisubversive base in Satipo, in the Frente Mantaro 
jurisdiction. The living conditions in the Army bases in the 
jungle are very different. 
  The Army has installed 15 countersubversive bases with 
military personnel to welcome repentant SL members and to offer 
them the best conditions and treatment. 
  A Tingo Maria military officer says: "We are not saying 
this. 
This is being said by the SL members who surrendered at our 
bases. They do not want to leave. In our installations they 
find food and work and they receive the best treatment."
