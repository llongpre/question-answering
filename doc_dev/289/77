   The U.S. war on drugs in Peru and Bolivia
remains dangerous and ineffective, with negligible amounts of
cocaine being halted despite more than $100 million spent on the
problem over the past 17 years, the State Department's internal
watchdog told Congress today.
   The programs ``have not resulted in significant reductions of
coca cultivation or the disruption of cocaine trafficking in the
host countries,'' said State Department Inspector General Sherman
Funk, whose staff just returned from the region.
   ``Coca production in these countries has increased every year
and less than 1 percent of the illicit drugs have been seized,''
Funk told the Senate Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee,
adding it is uncertain whether the programs can be made to work.
   But the program was defended by its top officials, who contended
the operation in those two countries _ dubbed ``Operation Snowcap''
_ is still developing and is improving.
   ``We cannot wait for a perfect solution,'' said David Westrate,
assistant administrator for operations of the Drug Enforcement
Administration. ``We're not going to solve this problem making
five-kilo cases in Cleveland, Ohio.''
   The hearing focused on a March report by Funk's office that
found U.S. personnel face unnecessary danger in Bolivia and Peru
and criticized the programs for waste and ineffectiveness.
   The report quoted a U.S. Embassy official in Lima as saying ``it
is only a matter of time before Americans are killed'' in Peru's
Upper Huallaga Valley, a region controlled by the heavily armed
Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, guerrillas.
   Funk's office found that DEA agents are coordinating air assault
operations of the civil police in Peru and the military in Bolivia,
even though most do not speak Spanish and have no appropriate
military training.
   Peru and Bolivia are the world's leading producers of coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine.
   Citing the report, subcommittee chairman John Kerry, D-Mass.,
called government efforts to eradicate coca crops ``a dismal
failure,'' saying they are indicative of ``disarray in the war on
drugs.''
   But DEA spokesman Frank Shults said the March 1989 report, based
on visits to Peru and Bolivia by investigators a year ago, was
``very dated'' and added improvements have been made in the
anti-drug program.
   ``Our program in Latin America is one that is evolutionary.
There have been problems, and we've been making changes,'' he said.
   In Peru, the threat from the Shining Path guerrillas has caused
the United States to pull back while a more secure operations base
is built for them, and most eradication activity is on hold.
   As an example of the problems, the audit said Bolivian military
units were trained for their drug assaults by U.S. Army Special
Forces teams. But Pentagon rules prohibit the soldiers from
accompanying Bolivian units on jungle forays, so DEA agents are
left to coordinate field operations.
   The agents often issued orders to troops that were at odds with
what they had been taught by the U.S. Army, such as running down a
trail after landing in a helicopter in hopes of discovering a
cocaine laboratory, or fanning out and walking abreast through the
brush. Such tactics ``defeated the purpose of the training and were
dangerous,'' the report said.
   Among other problems outlined in the report:
   _Aircraft operated by the department's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters are run in Bolivia without flight plans or proper
equipment, and are poorly maintained.
   _Bolivian drug interdiction searches have been an ``expensive
failure.'' Air searches run by the DEA seem random or are based on
unreliable intelligence, and yield little, it said. Just three drug
arrests were reported in the Beni region in northeast Bolivia in a
2{-year period; and 1,700 helicopter flight hours in 1987, costing
$1.7 million, yielded just 148 pounds of cocaine and the
destruction of 22 crude ``laboratories.''
   _Administrative snags with the Peruvian government resulted in
wasting more than $1 million on leased aircraft in 1987. The State
Department paid for 98 days but received just 14 days' service.
   _The manual coca eradication program in Peru has been
ineffective. The department spent $2 million in 1987 to eradicate
355 hectares of coca crops, and there was suspicion that there
could have been ``phantom'' employees on the program's payroll.
