  [Text] Lima, 7 Jan (EFE) -- Drug trafficking is spreading 
throughout Peru. Today there was a report on the discovery of 
pits for soaking coca leaves and making basic cocaine paste in 
areas of the country previously untouched by drug trafficking. 
  According to newspaper reports, four soaking pits were 
discovered in a house in Puerto Maldonado, the capital of the 
jungle department of Madre de Dios, which borders Brazil and 
Bolivia. 
  The discovery, which was made by the General Narcotics 
Directorate, has confirmed reports that drug traffickers -- who 
may have expanded their operations from Ayacucho to Cuzco in the 
Andean region -- are moving to Madre de Dios. 
  Authorities arrested the owner of the house and seized 
precursor chemicals such as ammonia and kerosene used to make 
basic paste. 
  Peru is the world's largest producer of the coca leaf, the 
raw material for cocaine, followed by Bolivia. 
  The newspaper EXPRESO also revealed today that an Army 
colonel and commander are currently on trial for keeping 114 kg 
of basic cocaine paste seized in a 1992 counternarcotics 
operation in the Huallaga River Valley in the northern jungle 
department of San Martin, an area known for drug trafficking. 
  The newspaper identified the officers as Colonel Eduardo 
Alvarado and Commander Walter Bue, who were accused by General 
Eduardo Bellido, who was chief of the Huallaga Front's 
political-military command at the time of the operation. 
  There are two other drug-trafficking cases in this same area 
that presumably involve an Army noncommissioned officer and a 
National Police officer. 
  It was also reported today that the Peruvian Navy discharged 
two officers and a technician who were arrested by the New 
Orleans Police (United States) for carrying pure cocaine. 
  Lima's EL COMERCIO newspaper revealed today that three 
sailors were arrested on 19 November 1993 in New Orleans after 
disembarking from the Navy vessel Ilo. The Navy members were 
identified as Jorge Saldias, Raul Baylon, and William Tello. 
  Based on a confidential report by the National Police 
Narcotics Intelligence Department, EL COMERCIO revealed on 3 
January that the production of washed basic cocaine paste in the 
country for 1993 reached 600 tons. 
  According to the report, not even 1 percent of that amount 
produced in Peruvian cocaine-producing areas -- specifically, 
the Peruvian central jungle and the Huallaga River Valley -- was 
seized during 1993. 
  The drug traffickers used over 2 million tons of basic paste 
to produce 600 tons of basic cocaine paste, which is 
subsequently washed to be "exported" by light Colombian planes 
flying to Peru. 
  The new development is that cocaine farmers not only grow 
the 
plant but also make the raw basic paste from the leaves they 
soak. They then take the paste to storage centers designated by 
Peruvian drug traffickers to be shipped to Colombia by light 
planes or crafts. 
  In addition to the Huallaga River Valley, the basic paste is 
produced in the Mayo River Valley, San Martin Department and 
Alto Maranon River, Amazonas Department -- both of which are 
located in the country's northern jungle, and in the areas 
between the Ene and Apurimac Rivers in the central jungle. 
  Other major cocaine areas include those of Puerto Inca and 
Puerto Bermudez in the jungle of Pasco Department in the 
Peruvian central mountain range.
