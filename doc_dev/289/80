   Three hundred masked men dressed in civilian
clothes rounded up residents of a remote jungle village and shot to
death about 50 elderly people and children, area officials said.
   The massacre occurred one week ago in Sonomoro, according to
officials 12 miles north in Concepcion. They said Wednesday that
they did not learn of it until five survivors arrived on foot to
report it.
   Villagers said they did not know who the attackers were, and
that the gunmen did not say anything during the slaughter.
   The killers could have been members of the Maoist-inspired
Shining Path guerrilla group, said officials in Concepcion, about
120 miles east of Lima, the capital. Both the rebels and government
security forces have been accused of similar massacres in the past.
   The survivors said the attackers, carrying automatic rifles and
grenades, rounded up villagers and shot to death about 50 of them
in the village square after separating them by age.
   They said the killers then burned homes and a school and left on
foot.
   The villagers asked Concepcion officials for police protection
and for money to bury the victims.
   Also Wednesday, police in Peru's main coca-growing region said
Shining Path rebels ambushed an army convoy and killed seven
soldiers.
   An undetermined number of soldiers were wounded in the Tuesday
attack, near the town of Campanilla, 400 miles north of Lima,
police said.
   There was no report of rebel casualties.
   Campanilla is in the upper Huallaga valley, where most of Peru's
coca, the raw material used to make cocaine, is grown. Peru is the
world's leading supplier of coca.
   Shining Path rebels control much of the valley and police say
they allow drug traffickers to operate in the region in exchange
for arms and money.
   The Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected governments
since 1980.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in the
violence. Most of the victims have been civilians.
