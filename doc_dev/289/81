   The army killed 85 Maoist Shining Path
guerrillas in three attacks in a remote, coca-rich jungle region
north of Lima, Col. Juan Rivero, military commander for the region,
said Tuesday.
   He said six soldiers were wounded in the clashes Thursday in the
Upper Huallaga River valley, 280 miles northeast of Lima.
   According to military reports, heavy fighting in the area the
past two weeks now has left at least 155 dead on both sides, with
guerrillas suffering most of the losses.
   Rivero said the army was pursuing a rebel column that attacked a
police station Wednesday, killing four police agents. A failed
guerrilla ambush Friday left 15 rebels and two soldiers dead, he
said.
   Rivero's headquarters are in Huanuco, a departmental capital 155
miles northeast of Lima.
   The Upper Huallaga is the world's main supplier of coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine. Shining Path guerrillas provide
protection for drug traffickers in exchange for money and arms.
