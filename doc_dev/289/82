  [Text] Despite the progress made thus far this year 
compared to 1993, the amount of precursors confiscated during 
the first four months of 1994 accounts for only 3.5 percent of 
the total amount used by drug traffickers to process cocaine 
paste and cocaine. 
  Drug enforcement personnel have already confiscated 37,646 
kg 
of chemical precursors from several trafficking organizations in 
just four months this year. By contrast, Interior Ministry 
figures show that during 1993, only 74,200 kg of chemicals -- 
including sulphuric acid, acetone, hydrochloric acid, sodium 
carbonate, potassium permanganate, and ether -- were confiscated. 
  Drug analysts and DEA experts noted that 13 clandestine 
airfields have been destroyed in the Upper Huallaga region, as 
well as a 2,000-meter strip in Quempiri (near Satipo) and 
another near Tarapoto. 
  They have also destroyed 10 pits and 11 maceration labs that 
were equipped with microwave ovens and other sophisticated 
equipment. 
  Intelligence agents have concluded that the geographical 
location of the Apurimac-Ene basin is the reason why it has 
become in recent months the main route for chemicals for the 
Peruvian-Colombian mafia organization laboratories. 
  Drug enforcement forces have noted, however, that no major 
seizures have been made yet owing to the complicity of the local 
residents and coca growers, who in some cases have been forced 
by former Shining Path members -- who now work for the drug 
mafia -- to remain silent to protect the traffickers. 
  The analysts believe the traffickers have conscripted 
residents and peasants in the jungle of Satipo, Oxapampa, Ciudad 
Constitucion, Puerto Bermudez, Icozaxin, Huanta, La Mar, San 
Francisco, Palmapampa, Santa Rosa, La Convencion, and Palestina 
in the illegal drug trade. 
  A few weeks ago, police confiscated chemical supplies in the 
townships of San Pedro (Villa Rica-Oxapampa) and Palestina, 
where a CB-1420 aircraft crashed and its passengers managed to 
escape with the help of local residents. 
  The chemicals are also being transported in small boats 
along 
the Pichis, Palcazu, Ene, Perene, and Apurimac rivers. 
  The township of Palmapampa (La Mar-Ayacucho), which is on 
the 
Apurimac River, continues to be the transaction center for the 
"firms," which are guarded by mercenaries armed with modern 
weapons. 
  The commander of drug enforcement operations is reinforcing 
his personnel with specialized personnel in the region, where 
until recently there were just 12 policemen and a small Air 
Force base, which tried to detect the small planes used by 
traffickers. 
  Some of those "firms" have moved their operations toward the 
Tambopata basin where, protected by the intricate wilderness, 
they set up laboratories to produce the drugs that are sent to 
Brazil.
