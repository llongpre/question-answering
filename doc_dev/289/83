  [Text] Following a drop in drug prices in the Huallaga 
region, coca may soon cease to be the queen of the jungle and 
Huallaga may no longer be a coca paradise. 
  What was until recently the symbol of prosperity and good 
fortune, coca is today associated with poverty and desperation. 
Abandoned towns, empty shops, unfinished buildings, houses for 
sale, and impoverished farmers are now the new image in the 
Huallaga region. In the old coca towns, which have become 
virtual ghost towns, trade is scarce and the economy is shaky. 
The entire region is facing a serious crisis because of a 
shortage of the dollars that came from narcotrafficking and the 
resultant drop in trafficking in the Huallaga area. 
  A Juanjui peasant told EXPRESO: "We used to make money from 
coca, now we lose. Months go by without selling any coca and 
when we do we sell it at below its market value." 
  Last year, cocaine paste sold for $1,500 per kilogram, today 
it is worth $200. 
  The drastic drop in prices follows the strict military 
control of the Huallaga region, which has forced traffickers to 
transfer their main operation centers to the northern and 
southern regions of the country. It seems to herald the end of 
the coca boom in the region. 
  Alto Bravo Mayor Tenazoa Ushinahui said: "Selling coca is 
not 
a lucrative trade anymore. The strict control has caused prices 
to plummet." 
  The decrease in narcotrafficking activities in this, the 
largest coca-producing region in the world, has brought changes 
to Huallaga. 
  Settlers and officials of the region are not the only ones 
to 
express concern over the critical situation affecting the 
region. Even a local beauty queen expressed her opinion during a 
recent beauty pageant in a San Martin district. In an outburst 
of sincerity when the jury asked her about trafficking "Miss 
Chazuta" bitterly complained about "low drug prices." She 
subsequently did not win the contest. 
  Despite its limitations, the military control established in 
the region since the middle of 1993 is the main reason why 
prices have dropped and trafficking activity has decreased. 
  Huallaga settlers believe the Peruvian Air Force [FAP] is 
mainly responsible for the change in trafficking activities. 
This has been achieved even though the FAP's antinarcotics 
struggle faces serious difficulties: It has almost inoperative 
radar and less sophisticated planes than those used by the 
traffickers. The proficiency of the FAP's Tucano [T-27] planes 
to intercept traffickers' planes in the region is acknowledged 
but not always welcomed. One Tarapoto settler complained: 
"Because of the Tucano planes, there are no more `trafficking 
flights' like before." The reputation of the T-27's in the 
region is such that a local orchestra named themselves "The 
Night Toucans." 
  Police operations and the downing of several planes have 
forced traffickers to transfer their operation centers to other 
regions where there is no control, and to change their flight 
routes and schedules to avoid repressive actions. These actions 
have forced Colombian pilots to increase their fees; they now 
charge $100,000 per flight, before they charged only $20,000. 
  Military and police activities have been unable, however, to 
stop an increase in trafficking activities in other regions. 
  The number of trafficking interdiction operations by the 
police rose in 1993 by over 20 percent compared to 1992. The 
figure rose from 3,180 to 3,938 in just one year. 
  Although slightly above that of 1992, the volume of drugs 
seized in 1993, over 8.5 tonnes, is notably less than the years 
when there was no military control. 
  The coca farming areas and the production of cocaine base 
have increased throughout the Upper and Lower Huallaga region, 
and the Udcayali, Ene, Apurimac, and Pichis Palcazu areas. 
  The Center of Development and Research of the Upper Jungle 
[Centro de Desarrollo e Investigacion de la Selva Alta] 
(Cedisa), has stated that coca is farmed in the 200 sub-basins 
of the rivers of San Martin. Biavo, Ponaza, Mishiquiyacu, 
Huayabamba, Saposoa, Sisa, Mayo, Sauce, Aibsea and Cumbaza are 
among the most important. 
  In the Upper Cumbaza region, just 600 km from Tarapoto, 
Cedisa experts have detected at least 600 hectares of coca 
plantations. Thus, trafficking has not been eradicated from the 
entire Huallaga region. Even when there is a shortage of 
flights and dollars, traffickers continue to operate in coca 
producing area villages. 
  The price of white coca paste surged from $220 to $330 per 
kilogram last September just because two flights were made to 
the region. This caused such excitement among Huallaga 
residents that, in their eagerness to sell the devalued white 
powder, residents of Shamboyacu--an eight-block hamlet in the 
Ponzaza valley of the San Martin forest--grabbed the drug they 
had stored and went to sell it in the middle of the street. The 
"coke balls"--of processed cocaine--were sold to the highest 
bidder. 
  Each flight seems to reawaken the villages of the region 
from 
the inactivity imposed by the shortage of dollars. Tarapoto, 
the capital of San Martin region, is by no means an exception. 
Following a flight, customers crowd discotheques, like 
"Papillon" and "Tropicana," where "middlemen" (drug stockists), 
policemen, and many pretentious local ladies mingle. 
  Despite the sharp decline in trafficking in the Huallaga 
region, it is too early to shout victory. The appearance of 
poppy fields in the region and peasants' avowed willingness to 
replace coca with poppies makes one to agree with Juanji Deputy 
Prefect Eduardo Maldonado, who contends that "drugs will remain 
the most profitable business of the region for a long time."
