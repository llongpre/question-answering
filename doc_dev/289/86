   An experimental program using herbicides to
destroy coca plants is bringing good results and may prove a major
weapon against cocaine trafficking, U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese said Monday.
   ``Peru has been one of the leaders in the use of herbicides for
eradicating coca plants. We have been cooperating with Peru in
these experimental studies,'' Meese said at a news conference.
   He later flew to Santa Cruz, Bolivia, the last stop on his
weeklong tour of Latin American countries where drug trafficking is
a major problem. His three-day visit to Bolivia will include a trip
to the cocaine-producing lowlands of the Chapare region.
   Meese said he agreed with Peruvian officials that no herbicide
should be used on a large scale if it causes ecological damage.
   ``Early results have indicated the development of a herbicide
that does not harm other plants,'' Meese said, without providing
details.
   The pilot project using herbicides may eventually replace the
system of manually uprooting the plants. The U.S. Embassy said
Washington is paying for the experiment.
   Meese arrived in Peru on Saturday and toured the Huallaga Valley
on Sunday.
   The valley, located on the jungle-cloaked eastern slopes of the
Andes, is the center of coca leaf growing in Peru. U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration officials say more than 60 percent of
the world's coca is grown in Peru.
   In the past year the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, has
agreed to protect cocaine traffickers in the valley in exchange for
a share of the drug barons' multimillion dollar earnings.
   Meese flew low over the valley to observe coca plots, and
officials traveling with him said he expressed amazement at the
number of clandestine airstrips and jungle clearings where coca
grows.
   Peruvian anti-drug police have blown up more than 170 airstrips
since 1985, but most have been repaired in a matter of days by drug
traffickers.
   More than 250,000 Peruvians live by growing coca and processing
the leaves into semi-refined cocaine.
   The coca paste is refined into pure cocaine in Colombia and
smuggled to the United States and Europe.
   Meese began his tour in the Dominican Republic last Wednesday
and visited Colombia and Ecuador before arriving in Peru.
