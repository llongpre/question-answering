   Items found on a body discovered near a
Peruvian jungle town indicated it was that of a reporter for The
Tampa Tribune, and that he was killed by leftist insurgents, his
newspaper reported today.
   Todd Smith, 28, who was researching stories on cocaine
traffickers and leftist guerrillas, was last seen Friday as he left
for the airport on the outskirts of Uchiza, 245 miles northeast of
Lima.
   The tentative identification was made late Tuesday, said Tom
Leary, assistant press attache for the U.S. Embassy in Peru. He
said an autopsy was to be performed today in Uchiza.
   The body was found three blocks from the central square of the
town in the Huallaga Valley in central Peru, a notoriously lawless
cocaine-producing region. He appeared to have been beaten and
strangled, said British journalist Simon Strong, who accompanied
U.S. officials to the scene.
   At least 15 Peruvian journalists have been killed in Peru's
guerrilla and drug trafficking violence, but Smith would be the
first American reporter slain.
   A placard found with the body suggests the slaying was the work
of the Maoist rebel group Shining Path, Strong said.
   The wooden sign denounced the United States: ``In this way die
North American spies linked to the Pentagon who are carrying out an
anti-subversive plan in Latin America and especially in Peru.
   ``Death to the North American imperialism. Long live the
Communist Party. Long live the war of the people.''
   His body was identified from a taxi receipt bearing his name
found in his pocket, Strong said.
   Smith, who was due back in Tampa on Monday, was in Peru on
vacation, said Lawrence McConnell, the Tribune's managing editor.
   ``I think it was his intent to come back and write about what he
found there, but we didn't assign him,'' McConnell said.
   ``This is one of the trickiest areas to work,'' said Michael
Smith, a correspondent for The Washington Post and Newsweek who has
lived in Peru for 16 years. ``If he was doing it alone, that's even
more difficult. Most journalists I know try to work in pairs when
they go to the Huallaga. It's not the kind of place to go alone.''
   The Upper Huallaga region, the world's largest source of the
coca leaf used to make cocaine, has been in turmoil since the
Shining Path recently started extorting payments from peasant
farmers and Colombian traffickers. The terrorists use the profits
to finance their revolution.
   Smith, a Latin American scholar, had reported previously on
jungle warfare in Central America.
   In 1981, he studied at the Instituto Fenix language school in
Cuernavaca, Mexico, and in 1983 he won the Lee Scholarship for
Latin America Research at the Library of Congress.
   After three years with the St. Petersburg Times, he left in May
1987 to become a freelance reporter in Central America.
   He traveled extensively, compiling a series on 10 weeks he spent
with the Nicaraguan rebels. He reported their 200-mile treks from
rebel bases in Honduras to combat zones in northern Nicaragua. The
series was published in the St. Petersburg Times and the San
Francisco Chronicle.
