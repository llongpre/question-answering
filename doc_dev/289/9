   American narcotics agents, trained in
tropical combat and armed with automatic weapons, are preparing to
move into a heavily fortified police garrison built with U.S. funds
in the heart of Peru's coca-rich jungle.
   The base at Santa Lucia, 65 miles northwest of here, is part of a
major offensive by the Peruvian government against drug gangs and
their allies _ dogmatic Maoist guerrillas who call themselves the
Shining Path and control much of the lush Upper Huallaga River
Valley on the eastern slopes of the Andes.
   Despite the danger posed by the guerrilla force, the United
States is making the campaign in Peru the centerpiece of its drive
against cocaine trafficking in the Andean nations, which supply the
coca leaf from which the drug is refined. The plans were drawn
before President Bush outlined his $7.9-billion drug program Sept. 5.
   ``Sixty to 70 percent of the world's coca production comes out of
here,'' said Craig Chretien, chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency's operations in Peru. ``Peru, of all the countries, offers
the best opportunity to do significant damage to the coca trade.''
   Once the anti-drug base is completed in October, as many as 50
Americans will operate directly from the Upper Huallaga region,
providing training and air support to some 300 police rangers
assigned to the garrison.
   The Americans include DEA agents and contracted Vietnam War
veterans who fly and maintain the nine U.S. Bell helicopters and two
C-123 cargo planes currently on loan to Peru for the anti-drug fight.
   ``The base is strategically located near all of the most
important trafficking areas,'' said Gen. Juan Zarate, chief of
Peru's drug police.
   The compound will have a three-quarter-mile airstrip that can
accommodate C-130 cargo planes, three helicopter pads, and nine
buildings, mainly barracks. The 100-acre area will be enclosed by
barbed wire and the outlying perimeter will be protected by mines.
   The step-up in the U.S. involvement comes as the Peruvian army,
armed with recently acquired Soviet armored helicopters, has
launched its heaviest campaign so far in the valley against the
Shining Path _ ``Sendero Luminoso'' in Spanish.
   The escalation in the fighting in the valley, however, has
aroused the concern of the Andean Commission of Jurists, among
others, that the United States could be drawn into the war against
the guerrillas.
   The commission, affliated with the Andean Pact alliance of
Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, noted recently that
while the base is intended for the drug fight, ``observers are
concerned that in the medium term it can be converted into a
springboard for the internationalization of the counterinsurgency
fight in Peru.''
   The DEA agents came to Tingo Maria, about 250 miles northeast of
Lima, Peru's capital, in search of cocaine traffickers. But they
have found themselves in the middle of a revolution and working in a
valley dominated by at least 2,500 guerrillas.
   ``It's probably the most hostile situation the DEA works in
anywhere,'' Chretien said in an interview in Lima.
   Earlier this year the Shining Path offered a $50,000 reward for
any DEA agent killed in the valley, according to the Rev. Paul
Feeley, a Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in Aucayacu, a town
35 miles north of Tingo Maria.
   ``The DEA has become a dirty word in the Huallaga Valley,'' he
said. ``Sendero, and most other people around here, too, see the DEA
as being anti-subversive, not just anti-drug.''
   In return for providing protection from police raids, the Shining
Path enjoys the support of tens of thousands of peasants who grow
coca in the valley, earning 10 times what they could from other
crops.
   The guerrillas collect a 10 to 15 percent ``tax'' from the
growers as well as charging Colombian traffickers $10,000 to $15,000
for each small plane that picks up cocaine paste for refining in
Colombia, according to the peasants and police.
   Houses along the Jungle Highway leading out of Tingo Maria, the
largest town in the valley, are scrawled in blood-red paint with
deadly messages for the DEA.
   One on a school building said: ``Get out, Yankees, while you can
_ you will find your tombs here.''
   The DEA is not permitted to take part in counterinsurgency wars.
But in practice that changed in Peru when it became clear two years
ago that the guerrillas were actively involved in the cocaine trade.
   ``The rule is that Sendero is fair game if they're trafficking in
drugs,'' Chretien said. ``What counts is if they're traffickers, not
their politics. That doesn't mean we go looking for guerrilla camps
or columns. But if we spot them from the air, we notify the police.
And if they attack us, we defend ourselves.''
   The DEA pulled out of this ramshackle settlement in a hurry in
April after a force of 200 rebels, aided by local drug gangs and
Colombian traffickers, overran a police post in Uchiza, a town a few
miles from Santa Lucia, killing 10 policemen. Three of them were
officers who were executed publicly in the town plaza after the
garrison ran out of ammunition.
   ``Tingo Maria isn't a healthy place if you're an American,'' said
a DEA agent. ``There's a Sendero committee on every block, every
block.''
   Tingo Maria, at the southern end of the narrow, 150-mile-long
valley, has the look of a town expecting an attack at any moment.
Nervous troops behind sandbag barricades guard the bridge over the
river to the town's airstrip.
   Villagers say the Shining Path now moves boldly through the
valley, in columns of up to 500 fighters. The rebels wear uniforms
of black T-shirts and khaki pants, forsaking the clothing of the
Peruvian peasantry that would allow them to fade into the civilian
populace.
   In response, the army has begun employing its Soviet helicopters,
known as ``flying tanks'' and armed with heavy-caliber machine guns
and rockets. In July the armed forces reported killing 210 rebels,
110 of them in three air and land battles over a two-day period in
the valley.
   ``It's getting to the point where there are going to be
full-scale battles between two strong forces,'' said Feeley, the
Canadian priest.
   Making use recently of four of the MI-25 helicopters, the army
strafed guerrilla columns and at least one village of peasants
considered to be Shining Path supporters.
   Human rights groups fear that the casualty tolls provided by the
army may include many civilians.
   Feeley said that 17 suspected Shining Path leaders detained by
the army in late July in Aucayacu ``are now on that long list of
disappeared people.''
   But the guerrillas have taken their own toll.
   In June three Shining Path assassins walked into the office of
Tingo Maria's popular mayor, Manuel Espinosa, and shot him to death
as he sat behind his desk.
   In Aucayacu, the Shining Path has assassinated four of the last
six mayors.
   ``The other two quit before they were killed,'' said Feeley.
