   President-elect Alberto Fujimori has indicated
he will probably support a U.S.-funded anti-drug plan his
predecessor rejected.
   ``In principle, I consider the agreement useful and opportune
for the fight against narco-terrorism,'' Fujimori, who is to take
office July 28, said Thursday.
   Under the accord, Peru would receive $35 million in U.S.
military aid this year. That includes $20 million for a training
base near Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, which is the world's main
source of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   At least a thousand Maoist Shining Path guerrillas are believed
to operate in the valley, located on the eastern jungles of the
Andes, 250 miles northeast of Lima.
   The rebels provide protection for drug traffickers in exchange
for money and arms.
   The military agreement has been strongly criticized by Peruvian
politicians who fear it will lead to direct U.S. involvement in the
country's guerrilla war.
   The outgoing president, Alan Garcia, refused to sign the
military aid agreement, demanding that the United States also
provide other economic aid for the anti-drug effort.
   U.S. and Peruvian authorities already run an anti-drug air base
in the valley. The training camp will likely be built at a
pre-existing Peruvian military base in the jungle, U.S. Embassy
sources said. An earlier plan to build the base in the valley was
abandoned.
   U.S.-Peruvian military relations were restricted after leftist
Gen. Juan Velasco Alvarado led a coup in 1968. Velasco forged close
military ties with the Soviet Union and obtained large amounts of
Soviet arms and equipment.
   More than 18,500 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path begans its armed insurgency 10 years ago.
