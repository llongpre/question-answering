   The government and Mobil Oil signed a contract
Friday opening for exploration much of Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley,
a region largely under leftist rebel control and a focus of
President Bush's anti-drug strategy.
   The valley, 270 miles northeast of Lima, is the source of most of
the world's coca leaf, the raw material for making cocaine. Peruvian
police with help from U.S. drug agents are conducting raids there to
destroy labs operated by drug traffickers allied with the Maoist
Shining Path guerrillas.
   President Alan Garcia said the presence of Mobil in the Huallaga
Valley is a ``long-term way to combat subversion and to combat the
cultivation of coca.''
   Government officials and company representitives did not comment
on what security measures would be taken to protect Mobil workers.
   The agreement calls for an initial investment of $107.5 million
in the valley over the contract's six-year exploration phase and the
drilling of at least one exploratory well a year. More than 14,000
square miles of the valley will be open for exploration.
   The company is required to begin exploration work within 180 days.
   Mobil predicts a possible investment of $1.5 to $2 billion over
the 30-year extraction phase of the contract should exploration
prove fruitful.
   Daniel Nunez, president of the state-owned petroleum company
PetroPeru, which represents the government in the contract, said the
area could contain as much as 1 billion barrels of oil.
   The government estimates Peru's current oil reserves at about 440
million barrels. Peru produces about 140,000 barrels a day, of which
about 120,000 barrels are used domestically.
   The only other foreign oil company operating in Peru is
Occidental Petroleum, which has wells in the Amazon jungle near the
border with Ecuador.
