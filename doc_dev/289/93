   Lima and much of Peru was blacked out Tuesday
night, minutes before President Bush gave a tough speech that
promised to crack down on drug traffickers throughout the Andes.
   The blackout was the sixth since June, most of which have been
caused by leftist rebels blowing up high-tension power pylons. The
Shining Path, known to operate in league with drug barons, has been
fighting to topple Peru's elected government since 1980.
   Bush's speech was to be broadcast live by radio in Peru, but the
radio station that was to carry the speech instead carried reports
on the blackout.
   According to radio reports, the blackout affected cities as far
north as Chiclayo, about 400 miles north of Lima, as well cities in
the Andean highlands.
   Shining Path started its insurgency near the highland city of
Ayacucho, but now operates through much of the Andes. It also
operates throughout the Upper Huallaga Valley, which produces about
60 percent of the world's coca crop. The rebels provide drug
traffickers with protection from the police and permission to do
business in the area in exchange for a portion of their drug profits.
   Early radio reports said police had reinforced personnel near the
U.S. Embassy to prevent terrorist attacks in the blackout. No
incidents were reported late Tuesday.
