   There's a strong political impulse to launch U.S. military and technological power against drug problems in Latin America. 
But some here say the U.S. would be wise to control such urges. 

   "Say we sprayed all the coca plants and devastated the countryside and just ended coca traffic," says Rence Lee, an analyst of Third World economies who has just written a book on cocaine traffic entitled "White Labyrinth." 

   What would follow, he asserts, is political and economic chaos in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, coupled with a rise in left-wing guerrilla groups. 
Meanwhile, unabated cocaine demand from the U.S., he adds, would result in fresh plantings of coca, the resilient, woody plant that is being grown increasingly throughout the Amazonian jungle and in Andean valleys. 

   At the moment, the threat of Yankee military power intimidates the Latin American drug lords less than the jurisdiction of the U.S. court system. 
Last week major drug traffickers escalated a bombing campaign in Colombia, seeking to have the Colombian government negotiate amnesties to block their extradition to the U.S. 

   Still, some U.S. officials -- most notably, drug czar William Bennett -- openly muse about the potential of military action in or against the drug-producing countries. 
He is intent on deploying U.S. military advisers for "low intensity" warfare in Colombia, as well as tapping the Pentagon for more logistical and intelligence support for anti-drug forces. 
Over the weekend, in fact, replacement parts for U.S. Blackhawk helicopters began arriving in the jungles for use in the drug war. 
U.S. helicopter instructors have also landed in recent days. 

   But there's plenty of risk even in such limited excursions; after all, the use of military advisers teaching "low intensity" warfare accounted for the nation's first involvement in Vietnam in the early 1960s. 
Mr. Bennett is quick to say that he has no plans to "send in the 82nd Airborne next week." 
But he does say he will look for more from "this enormous resource, this thing we spend $300 billion on" -- the Pentagon. 

   The eventual massive use of U.S. power in Vietnam ultimately failed from a misunderstanding of local politics -- just as it would falter in South America, critics say, unless the U.S. gets a better grasp on the political and economic stakes in the drug trade. 
Although roughly 90% of the profit from cocaine is earned after it reaches the U.S., the 10% or so earned in the exporting countries accounts for upwards of half their foreign-exchange earnings. 

   "You would be talking about destroying the resources of people who don't have any other income," says Gregory Treverton, an analyst for the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations. 
He argues that the U.S. must find ways to attack the drug traffickers and, at the same time, apply economic aid that can lure as many as a million poor farmers out of the coca fields and back to growing legitimate crops, such as coffee. 

   The cocaine trade begins with these farmers, who are busy tearing up the Amazon jungle and Andean valleys to grow coca, which is transformed there into a crude paste. 
Coca paste becomes cocaine in more sophisticated chemical processing plants in Colombia. 
Tampering with a cash crop like coca -- which is grown legally in Peru and Bolivia -- will be especially tricky because the prices of traditional income earners, such as tin and coffee, have been falling. 

   To a small degree, at least, the U.S. already has conducted an attack on coca production. 
According to the U.S. State Department, the herbicide Spike and a similar chemical have been sprayed from the air on a patch of the coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru as part of a joint U.S.-Peruvian government experiment. 

   Sendero Luminoso (the Shining Path), a violent, Maoist, drug-dealing guerrilla group, has begun to organize Peruvian farmers, blaming health problems from allegedly widespread U.S.-sponsored aerial spraying. 
"We anticipated there would be a backlash," says Catherine Shaw, spokeswoman for the Bureau of International Narcotics Matters. 
She says the matter of whether to use the chemicals on broader areas is still subject to environmental study. 

   U.S. environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, have protested the Peruvian use of Spike, which is used in the U.S. to kill brush-like plants while leaving other types of vegetation.
