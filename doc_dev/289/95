  [Text] In the last six months Peruvian Army, Air Force, and 
National Police drug enforcement units located more than 100 
clandestine airstrips in Upper Huallaga from where drug 
"corporations" have been sending washed cocaine base to new 
processing sites in the Andean Trapezium [an area in southern 
Peru that includes Puno, Cusco, and Apurimac Departments and 
parts of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, and Junin Departments] and 
elsewhere in Peru. 
  The Army has used dynamite to destroy most of these illegal 
airstrips, especially those with concrete runways. In other 
cases either bulldozers or just picks and shovels were used to 
tear up the landing strips. 
  Undercover agents who have infiltrated drug gangs have been 
reporting, however, that the traffickers reopen at least a 
quarter of the landing strips government forces destroy and are 
constantly building new ones. 
<H5>  Huanuco </H5>
  According to information obtained in Leoncio Prado (Huanuco 
Department) after Operation Aries, the drug "corporations" use 
hundreds of peasants enslaved by the Shining Path [SL] to 
rebuild these landing strips. 
  For example: 36 illegal landing strips have been destroyed 
in Huanuco Department along the Frijol, Azul, Megote, Magdalena 
and Camote Rivers and in the jungle areas of Santa Marta, La 
Union, La Morada, Molope, Yanajanca, Cachicoto, Monzon, Santa 
Rosa, Santa Martha, Primavera, Pavayacu, Bajo Sucre, San Pedro 
de Chonta, Alto Huanuco, Cascarilla, Paraiso, and Alto Alianza. 
  Right now planes are operating again from the illegal 
landing 
strips in Monzon, Cachicoto, Santa Rosa, San Pedro de Chota, 
Pavayacu, and Alto Huanuco, although the presence of Huallaga 
Front military forces tracking fleeing members of the broken-up 
Red Sea Battalion is hampering the flights. 
<H5>  San Martin </H5>
  Intelligence sources reported that 42 clandestine landing 
strips built between 1985 and 1990 in San Martin Department with 
the connivance of the political and military of that time have 
been destroyed. 
  According to the sources, the attack on the drug 
"corporations" began in 1991 because previous raids within the 
framework of the so-called Operation Verde Mar [Green Sea] were 
aimed at the "small fry" of the drug trade. 
  These landing strips were located in Ramal de Aspuzana, Alto 
Uchiza, Alto Manteca, San Francisco, El Cairo, Quebrada de 
Huachipa, Puerto Pizana, Polvora, Huicungo, Pachiza, Pucaypillo, 
Bello Horizonte, Alto Aspuzana, Alto Espino, Cruz Pampa, 
Cachiyacu, Huacamayo, Sion, Campanilla, Dos de Mayo, Barranca, 
and Yanayacu. There also were landing strips along a branch of 
the Puerto Pizana-Polvora Highway and along the banks of the 
Balsayacu and Canuto Rivers. Washed cocaine base arrived at 
these strips on rafts and motorboats. 
<H5>  Ucayali </H5>
  It has been reported that eight landing strips that were 
being used not only to ship drugs but also to supply arms to the 
MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] and the SL have been 
destroyed in Ucayali. 
  These strips were located in Santa Ana, Aguaytia, Boqueron, 
and Chumbillo and along a branch of the Federico Basadre Highway 
near Pampas village. The latter strip has been destroyed 
repeatedly, but the latest reports indicate that it is 
apparently back in service. 
<H5>  Loreto </H5>
  Drug enforcement forces have destroyed 18 landing strips in 
Loreto Department where chemical precursors are brought in from 
Bolivia to turn washed cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride 
at portable processing facilities. 
  These landing strips that the jungle has now swallowed were 
located on the banks of the Putumayo and Napo Rivers and their 
tributaries, and near San Fernando (Caballococha), Yanahuana (on 
the Colombian border), Bellavista, Jerusalen, Yaguas, Huapaya, 
Mishana, Remanso, Estrecho, Genaro Herrera, Baguzon, San Jose de 
Yanayacu, Icarapana, and Vidal (where the Napo-Flor de Agosto 
Highway begins). The landing strips in Flor de Punga-Requena and 
Tumbipoca-Amazon River valleys also were destroyed. In the 
process of the latter operations drug enforcement forces clashed 
with some drug traffickers, whom they arrested. 
<H5>  New and Reopened Landing Strips </H5>
  According to recent reports, however, the landing strips in 
Yanahuana on the Colombian border, Bellavista, and the Flor de 
Punga-Requena and Tumbipoca-Amazon River valleys are back in 
service. 
  It is also rumored that Colombian drug "corporations" have 
had several new landing strips built on the Ucayali River's 
banks and in the jungle of Madre de Dios Department, where 
cocaine-processing laboratories operate. 
  Experts have indicated that gold prospectors who work along 
the Tambopata River's banks are hired to build the new landing 
strips.
