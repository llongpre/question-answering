   President Alberto Fujimori says President Bush
extended the deadline for signing an agreement on U.S. anti-drug
aid, which Fujimori has criticized for lacking funding to help coca
farmers switch to other crops.
   Fujimori on Wednesday appeared to reject the $35.9 million in
economic aid, saying that since the package ``is destined only for
the fight against drug trafficking, we are not going to sign this
agreement.''
   Fujimori had said any agreement must include aid to wean farmers
away from growing coca leaves, the main ingredient for cocaine, and
persuade them to cultivate other cash crops. Better roads into
cities have been suggested as one solution.
   However, the Peruvian president told the state news agency
Andina that Bush on Friday extended a recently expired deadline for
agreement. Fujimori said he was confident the two nations would
negotiate an agreement by the end of the month.
   Fujimori met Friday with U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quaynton, who
delivered the message from Bush.
   The aid proposal includes $20 million to provide soldiers with
arms and equipment and to build a training camp in the coca-rich
Upper Huallaga Valley.
   The northern valley, 250 miles northeast of Lima, is the world's
largest supplier of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   The army wants the agreement to focus on aid for fighting the
Maoist Shining Path rebels, according to the local news magazine
Caretas. The magazine said the United States wants the wording of
the agreement to state the aid is solely to fight drug trafficking.
   Opposition politicians have criticized the proposal, fearing it
could lead to direct U.S. involvement in a 10-year-old guerrilla
war that has claimed nearly 20,000 lives.
   The police, which direct Peruvian anti-drug efforts, already
operate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration an anti-drug
helicopter base in the Huallaga Valley. Guerrillas attacked the
base in April, battling U.S. pilots.
