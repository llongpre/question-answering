<LEADPARA>  UNTIL recently, the government of Jamaica was bombarded with complaints from
tourists about panhandlers, bogus tour guides, marijuana peddlers and
overzealous hair-braiders -- all long a part of the island scene.;    This
damaging image filtered back to the United States, where travel agents,
concerned about safety, often steered clients to all-inclusive resorts, where
they would not have to leave a compound.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Update: Jamaica  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     About a year ago, feeling a threat to its largest industry, the Jamaican
government got tough and instituted a plan to stop the harassment of tourists.
"We have established an island-wide campaign to keep the streets safe as long
as there are tourists in Jamaica," said one uniformed police officer, who was
positioned recently in front of a hotel in Ocho Rios.;    The plan seems to be
working.;    On a recent trip to Jamaica, I saw tourists getting directions at
11 p.m. outside a newly erected kiosk in downtown Ocho Rios. I also saw
policemen walking the streets and chatting frequently with tourists.;   
During the day, police on foot patrol were seen scolding loitering teen-agers,
making arrests and running panhandlers away from street corners and off
beaches. And at dusk, on the grounds of many hotels, security guards with
large dogs patrolled the area until sunrise. Most tourists interviewed said
they felt safe walking the streets and were not being harassed.;    During my
six-day visit, I ventured out for dinner every evening, visiting restaurants
and bars in Ocho Rios with no problems. I occasionally walked a half-mile back
to my hotel to work off the curry goat, rice and peas and fried plantains.;   
"The bottom line is that we want tourists to come to Jamaica but we also want
them to have a safe, relaxing experience," says Judith Clarke, marketing
officer for the government-run Jamaica Tourist Board in Ocho Rios. "We have
100,000 tourists a month on the island and the number of crimes reported to us
have been minute. We're not going to let a few people ruin it for so many.";  
 Lisa Weeks, a travel agent based in Paterson, N.J., has traveled to Jamaica
12 times in the past five years.;    "I have never seen as many policemen on
the streets or as many visitor centers across the island like I see now," said
Weeks, who just returned from a tour of Negril, Ocho Rios and Montego Bay. "I
was not hassled at all . .  But people have to remember that Jamaica is still
a poor country and people sell things to make money.";    Several tourists
interviewed, however, said they were enjoying Jamaica but felt more
comfortable staying in their rooms at night.;    Jackie Rose, a personal
computer analyst for Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., recently returned from a
week in Ocho Rios, where she stayed in an all-inclusive resort because she was
warned about venturing out alone. She said staying within a protective resort
is a cautious way to visit Jamaica, and that she felt she had missed out on
the island's lifestyle, culture and entertainment.;    "There were daily
discussions at the hotel about safety, and a bunch of couples expressed
concern because travel agents told them not to leave the resorts," Rose said.
"We didn't go out much. My boyfriend didn't want to go to any clubs because he
didn't feel comfortable.";    The Jamaicans who worked for the resort were
very nice and friendly people, Rose said, but something was missing. "Next
time I'd like to see more of the night life.";    Clarke, of the Jamaica
Tourist Board, concedes that Jamaica is not without crime, but said most
violent activity is confined to the crowded capital of Kingston, a city
tourists rarely visit.;    "Look, we have crimes just like everywhere else: we
have the muggings, the beatings, the robberies and the shootings -- you know,
good old-fashioned New York city crimes," Clarke said. "But tourists have to
think, too. Don't come to Jamaica and leave your common sense at home. This is
a paradise, but it's also real people living real lives and we're still a poor
country. If you don't go for walks alone in New York after midnight, then you
may not want to do it here, either.";    After tourists report burglaries or
robberies, Clarke said, she often learns they left their hotel rooms unlocked
or "drove off into the hills with a man wearing no shoes and torn shorts who
told them that he'll give them a cheap tour of the city.";    To reduce these
problems, Clarke said, 84 additional police officers have been assigned to
patrol the island's major tourist centers: Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, Negril,
Runaway Bay and Port Antonio.  </TEXT>
