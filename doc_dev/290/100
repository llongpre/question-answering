  [Text] Tomorrow in Jamaica, experts from 38 Caribbean Basin 
countries will begin forming an integration organization that 
intends to create a free-trade zone in the area. This will 
include Cuba, the organizers of the forum announced. The work 
group will discuss, in Kingston, Jamaica, the document 
structuring the planned association of Caribbean nations, the 
first of its kind and one that will include all the area's 
countries. 
  The organization will bring together the nations of the 
Caribbean Basin or those with a Caribbean coast, to form a bloc 
of nations ranging from small, agriculture-exporting nations to 
countries such as Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. It will be a 
conglomerate of 205 million inhabitants, with a joint gross 
national product of $6 billion and a commercial flow of $2 
billion a year.
