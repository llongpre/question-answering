   A festival that was supposed to show this city's
Latin community at its party-giving best has erupted into a bitter
dispute over a ban on three singers who once performed in Cuba.
   On Thursday, The Miami Herald announced it was pulling out of the
Calle Ocho festival because the event's sponsors, the Little Havana
Kiwanis Club, canceled the scheduled appearance of the
Espanolisimos, a Spanish singing duo.
   Reflecting the city's fervently anti-communist Cuban community,
the Kiwanis Club has banned whoever has performed in Cuba since
Fidel Castro's government took over the island in 1959.
   The singing duo, initially hired by the Kiwanis Club, had been
scheduled to sing on a Herald-sponsored stage during the weekend
festival, which is expected to attract a million visitors.
   But earlier this week, the club discovered that one of the
Espanolisimos singers, De Raymond, performed in a Cuban festival in
1970.
   ``Everybody's in a very tough situation, and we are in a position
that we cannot change our policy,'' said architect Willy Bermello, a
former Kiwanis president. ``We are sorry that a political issue has
made a musical event into a political event.''
   In the past two weeks the club has also barred Puerto Rican salsa
singer Andy Montanez because he sang in Cuba in 1980, and
Mexico-based Brazilian singer Denise De Kalafe, who accepted an
invitation from her own government to perform in Cuba in 1981.
   All three singers have declared their opposition to Cuba's
communist government, but the Kiwanis Club has refused to budge.
   Roberto Suarez, associate publisher of the Herald, said the club
rule made it impossible for the newspaper to continue its
sponsorship of the festival.
   The newspaper ``should not be part of something where there is
censorship, which goes against the First Amendment,'' Suarez said.
   Even within Miami's Cuban community, there are sharp differences
over the policy.
   Tomas Garcia Fuste, executive news director of WQBA-AM and one of
Miami's best-known commentators _ as well as a vociferous
anti-communist _ has criticized the Kiwanis policy.
   ``Just because they went to Cuba is not a reason to not let them
perform,'' Fuste said. ``If they make any pro-Castro statements,
then they should be banned. But not just because they went there.''
   For De Raymond, the ban is particularly painful. He was barred
from Spain's Socialist Party-run television for six years, he said,
because of his strong anti-communist views. He even received death
threats from leftists, he said.
   ``Not only should I not be banned, but _ and I've never said this
_ I deserve a tribute, not a ban,'' De Raymond said.
   Calle Ocho _ or Eighth Street in Spanish, referring to the main
street of Miami's Little Havana _ has grown more popular each year
since it began in 1978. It now attracts sponsors and acts from all
over the Latin world, as well as tens of thousands of tourists.
