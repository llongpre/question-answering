   Some notes gathered in the aftermath of
Hurricane Gilbert, which struck Jamaica on Sept. 12:

   The 17 members of a British Airways crew got caught up in the
hurricane at Kingston's Pegasus Hotel. The morning after, they took
over the duties of hotel staffers, most of whom were unable to get
to work. In return for free meals, flight attendants and cockpit
crew waited tables, washed dishes, tended bar and lugged suitcases
up to guests' rooms for a full day. For burser Richard Evans, the
toughest part was washing dishes, pots and pans ``piled to the
ceiling'' with no hot water. The answer was to use a little lime
juice.

   Power failure knocked out traffic lights in Kingston, and
driving in the city of 750,000 inhabitants became a risky business.
You nose into the road and hope oncoming cars stop and let you in.
If they don't, you just wait. At one especially busy intersection,
a fellow wearing a bright red shirt and flowered bermuda shorts
directed traffic with the flair of a seasoned cop.

   An insurance company's billboard that greets visitors to the
northern coast resort of Ocho Rios could cause a shrug. The sign, a
quarter of which was ripped away, carries the message: `` `S YOUR
HOME INSURED? If so, relax and enjoy the scenery.''

   Along with winds reaching 145 mph, Hurricane Gilbert dumped up
to 10 inches of rain on Jamaica, swelling rivers and reservoirs.
But a week after the storm, water was in dangerously short supply
because electricity had not been restored to most pumping and
filtration stations. In Kingston, people gathered at burst water
mains and open hydrants. In the countryside, roads were lined with
people trudging behind wooden carts loaded with jugs and buckets
filled with water. Women balanced plastic containers on their
heads. Health officials warned against taking water from rivers and
streams that could be contaminated by the carcasses of animals.
Millions of water-purification tablets were being airlifted into
the country.

   Twelve families were sheltering at Woodbourne Seventh-day
Adventist Church in St. Thomas Parish, one of the four eastern
Jamaican districts hardest hit by the hurricane. They told how the
winds demolished their homes and furniture and and wiped out their
meager farms. A slightly built teen-age boy was asked if he had
anything to say. ``I feel frightened, sir,'' he said. ``We don't
have anyplace to live.'' It seemed cruel to ask him anything else.
