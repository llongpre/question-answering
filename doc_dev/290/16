   Forming the world's longest conga line with almost
120,000 dancers was no problem Sunday for members of the crowd that
filled the streets of Little Havana for the Calle Ocho festival.
   ``It's very easy: Just face toward downtown, grab the shoulders
of the person in front of you _ and dance,'' Juan Carlos Sanchez,
organizer of the event.
   Anna Nicholas, a representative of the Guinness Book of World
Records, confirmed a record had been set at 119,986 dancers,
shattering the old mark of a 10,442-person chain formed last August
in Canada.
   ``There's no way it could fail. As soon as the music plays, we
just grab on to somebody and hang on,'' said Nuvia Valdez, one of
about 1.5 million who turned out for the food and fun of what is
billed as the nation's largest Hispanic festival.
   The river of people along 23 blocks of Eighth Street _ Calle
Ocho in Spanish _ began to move when Gloria Estefan and the Miami
Sound Machine blared their hit ``Conga'' from loudspeakers.
   On the street, 96 volunteers with bullhorns attempted to direct
the traffic of dancing feet, while Ms. Estefan shouted to the
crowd: ``Is everybody ready? Let's conga!'' A special computer
program helped count the dancers, and 30 observation posts were set
up.
   Since the street was clogged, forming a single line was
difficult, and untold thousands of people formed in a bevy of
smaller lines in addition to the mega-line that made the Guinness
tally.
   ``I've never seen this many people in one place in my life,''
said Jean-Louis Levasseur, who was vacationing from New Brunswick,
Canada. ``There's more people on this one street than in all of the
Maritime Provinces.''
