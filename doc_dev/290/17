   ``Come on everybody _ let's do the conga!'' was the
rallying cry for more than 120,000 people who lined up at Little
Havana's Calle Ocho festival and danced into the record books.
   About 1.5 million people were jammed along 23 blocks of Eighth
Street (Calle Ocho in Spanish) on Sunday when Gloria Estefan and
the Miami Sound Machine set about forming a conga line.
   ``Is everybody ready? Let's conga,'' said Ms. Estefan as her
band began playing their hit ``Conga.'' People began to grab the
shoulders in front of them and sidestep to the Latin beat.
   ``There's no way it could fail. As soon as the music plays, we
just grab on to somebody and hang on,'' said Nuvia Valdez, who
showed up early to take part in the historic strut.
   When it was over, Anna Nicholas of the Guinness Book of World
Records confirmed a record line of 119,986 dancers, shattering the
old mark of a 10,442-person chain formed last August in Canada. The
computer-assisted count was made by volunteers at 30 observation
posts.
   ``It may seem like a conga line is an inane thing, but it
represents a lot more,'' Ms. Estefan said. ``Because this community
is so diverse, getting along and having a street party of this
magnitude really says a lot about our city.''
   The festival began as a block party 11 years ago to showcase
Miami's Cuban culture.

   There are gadget lovers. There are cat lovers.
There are people who love home improvement projects. If enough
people fall into all three categories, the maker of the electronic
cat door is in luck.
   Reilor Inc. of Horsham, Pa. is showing off its product here at
the annual National Home Center Show, which started Sunday.
   The cat door comes with a coded collar key so only the owner's
cat can enter. The door can be programmed to open from only the
inside or only the outside, or from both sides. It's available at
pet stores for $120-$150, said Shelley Daniels, a spokeswoman for
the show.
   An estimated 36,000 retailers are expected to attend the show,
sponsored by Home Center Magazine of Lincolnshire.
   The magazine says it did a recent survey of 1,561 homeowners
across the country that found 93 percent of those households
undertook at least one home improvement project last year.
   ``U.S. homeowners seem willing to tackle almost any type of home
improvement imaginable,'' said John Berry, an official of Vance
Publishing Corp., the company producing the show.
