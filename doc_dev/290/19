Although children are becoming increasingly welcome on board cruise liners, 
before booking a cruise find out if the line offers programs for kids and 
whether there will be other children on the voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Even well-traveled youngsters can get bored on board. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect free 24-hour baby-sitting. Youth counselors are aboard to enrich 
your child's vacation, not take him off your hands. 
</P>
<P>
If you think you'll need a baby-sitter, before booking the cruise ask if crew 
members will be available for baby-sitting duty, and inquire about the fees. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid booking a family trip on a line that does not offer free or discounted 
travel, counselors and special programs for children. The lack of such is 
usually a tip-off that the line prefers adult clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Lines offering special summer prices and programs for children include American 
Hawaii, Carnival, Chandris, Commodore, Costa, Delta Queen Steamboat Co., 
Dolphin, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, Premier and Regency. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year Sitmar had the most active shipboard program for children. 
However, since Sitmar was absorbed by Princess there seems to be decreased 
emphasis on youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
Premier, Costa and Regency offer discount prices for single-parent families by 
charging the parent a per-person, double-occupancy rate and the child a lower 
third- or fourth-passenger fare. 
</P>
<P>
Premier also offers a seven-day package with a Bahamas cruise and Disney World 
stay. The price ranges from $595 to $1,095 per person, double occupancy, for 
adults, depending on accommodations; $225 to $295 for children in the same 
room. 
</P>
<P>
It will be copied by Carnival for February, 1990, when the Carnivale will be 
repositioned to Port Canaveral for three- and four-day Bahamas sailings 
packaged with Disney World programs. 
</P>
<P>
This summer Carnival's fare for children sharing a cabin with two full-fare 
adults is $395 on all seven-day cruises, $190 and $250 on three- and four-day 
cruises. In some cabins Carnival can add a fifth berth. 
</P>
<P>
Cribs and high chairs are available on all ships, and baby-sitting is offered 
at a nominal charge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Carnival's "Junior Cruisers" program has been extended from 
limited sailings to sailings year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Regency Cruises offers free Caribbean sailings between June 18 and Aug. 27 for 
the child who shares a cabin as the third passenger with two full-fare adults. 
The fare for another child, traveling as the fourth passenger, is $195. 
</P>
<P>
Regent Star seven-day sailings depart on Sunday from Montego Bay, Jamaica, with 
two itineraries. One includes Costa Rica, Cartagena, Aruba and a partial 
transit of the Panama Canal. The other includes Ocho Rios, St. Thomas, St. 
Barts, St. Martin and San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Special shore excursions for young people will be available, including a 
snorkeling safari, as well as shipboard disco parties, games, crafts and 
special children's videos. 
</P>
<P>
Single parents and single grandparents also get a fare break from Regency for 
Regent Star sailings. The parent or grandparent pays the per-person, 
double-occupancy rate on the three lowest-priced categories available (from 
$1,065 to $1,315). Children under 12 travel for $665 to $695. 
</P>
<P>
Adult air fare is included, but children fly for $195 to $395, depending on the 
gateway city. 
</P>
<P>
A children's counselor offering programs on American history will be aboard 
seven-day cruises on the paddle-wheeler Mississippi Queen, departing New 
Orleans Aug. 11, 18 and 25; Sept. 1 and 15, and Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Children through 16 years can travel free with two full-fare adults booking a 
cabin from a minimum of $2,065 per person, double occupancy. Two additional 
children under 16 will be accommodated free in a separate cabin, if space is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Costs include free round-trip air fare for parents. For more information, call 
the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. toll-free at (800) 543-1949. 
</P>
<P>
Between Thursday and Sept. 2 American Hawaii will allow up to two children, 16 
or younger, to cruise free in any cabin costing $1,725 per person, double 
occupancy, and higher, when accompanied by two full-fare passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Kids can cruise free with Chandris on all Bermuda sailings this summer, if they 
are under 12 and share a cabin with two full-fare adults. Air fare is extra. 
</P>
<P>
The line charges children $499 to $799 for other seven-day cruises. This 
includes air fare for travelers under 12 who share a cabin with two full-fare 
adults. Children under 2 years travel free.
