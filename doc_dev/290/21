<F P=106> [Article by Lloyd Williams: "Three Jamaicans Die From </F>
Cocaine Ingestion"] 
  [Text] Kingston (NICA)--Three Jamaicans have died here and 
overseas in the last few days from ingesting cocaine which they 
were smuggling in packets in their stomachs. 
  Police sources have identified them as Sonia 
Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover; Ovel Washington 
Porter, 28, a seaman of Flankers, St. James and an unidentified 
male higgler. 
  Mrs. Whitley-Anderson died in Montego Bay on Thursday on 
arriving on the SAM flight from San Andres, Colombia; Mr. Porter 
died in Bermuda on Sunday and the unidentified higgler died 
Thursday morning while he was preparing to take the COPA flight 
back to Kingston from Panama City. 
  According to Narcotics Police Division sources, Mrs. 
Whitley-Anderson went to San Andres off the Colombian coast on 
SAM flight 506 which left from Montego Bay on Sunday and 
returned on Thursday. 
  She fell ill while the plane was returning to Montego Bay 
and 
when it landed at 3 p.m., a physician who was on board, 
pronounced her dead. 
  Five small packets of cocaine were found in her brassiere 
and 
she is believed to have swallowed several more to smuggle them 
in. 
  An autopsy is to be done on her body tomorrow. 
  The unidentified male higgler was found dead in the Aruba 
hotel in Panama City on Thursday morning. 
<H5>  Sources </H5>
  Sources say he was getting ready to leave for Kingston on 
the 
COPA flight yesterday when he died from an overdose of cocaine 
which he swallowed to smuggle here. 
  Mr. Porter worked as a seaman aboard the cruise ship Song of 
America but lost his job recently. He left Jamaica on November 
23 and after travelling to Miami, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia, 
arrived in Hamilton, the capital of Bermuda, on December 4. He 
fell ill and died the following day and an autopsy done on him 
on December 6 revealed that he had in his stomach 24 packets 
with substance confirmed to be cocaine, weighing 191.99 grams. 
  Half a gram of cocaine in Bermuda sells for US$125. 
  Mr. Porter's body is to be flown to Jamaica today 
(Saturday). 
  On Thursday agents from the Narcotics Police Division 
accosted four women who had arrived at the Norman Manley 
International Airport in Kingston aboard COPA flight 4l8 from 
Panama City. They were intercepted outside the airport after 
they had cleared immigration and customs. 
  One, identified by the police as Joan Watson, 38, higgler, 
of 
11 Olympic Way, Kingston, stripped herself naked and refused to 
be searched, but the police subdued her and when she was 
searched, a packet with 1 lb. of cocaine was found in her vagina. 
  The others, Joan Watson's sister, Densetta Watson, 33, 
Maureen Patterson, 30, of 263 Amos Path, Bay Farm Villas, 
Kingston and Lavern Wilson, 38, of Chapelton Road, May Pen, 
Clarendon, were similarly searched and each was found with a 
packet with 3/4 lb of cocaine in the vagina. The cocaine was 
wrapped in masking tape. 
  All four were charged with possession of cocaine, dealing in 
cocaine and importing cocaine. They are to appear before the 
Sutton Street RM court next week.
