   The first American tourists back from Jamaica since
it was overrun by Hurricane Gilbert were thankful to escape though
they conceded they got out relatively unscathed.
   ``The tourists were much more fortunate than most of the
Jamaicans,'' Charles McKenney said Thursday after clearing customs
at Miami International Airport.
   ``There are some people there who haven't had food or water for
several days. But most hotels took care of their guests.''
   ``The worst part was not being able to contact anyone to let
them know how you were,'' said the New Smyrna Beach resident's
wife, Joanna.
   With their luggage, passengers arriving here brought tales of
devastation in the villages and inconveniences in the resorts.
   ``There were no lights, no running water,'' said Eileen Veskey
of Detroit, who stayed in her 14th-floor Montego Bay hotel room as
the hurricane blew through the island Monday.
   ``We were going to the pools for water to flush the toilets.''
   But tourists who arrived here Thursday on an Eastern Airlines
flight said few hotels or resorts were without some drinking water
or food.
   As the Miami-bound plane lifted off the Montego Bay runway,
cheers rang out, and when it landed here, tourists were still
celebrating.
   ``We're home,'' said Dr. Paulette Roy, 65, of New York City.
``Oh yes, we're very happy to be back.''
   Gilbert, one of the century's strongest hurricanes, passed over
Jamaica with 175-mph winds that destroyed homes and farms and cut
off electricity and communication throughout the island, where at
least 26 people were killed. The Montego Bay airport reopened
Thursday.
   ``The island is still in pretty bad shape,'' said Jim Cullipher,
one of 44 Palm Beach County travel agents who had been trapped in
Montego Bay by the storm. ``It seems we won't be sending people to
Jamaica for a while.''
   But in the Cayman Islands, W. Norman Bodden, the tourism
minister, said visitors can begin returning to the three-island
chain that was spared serious damage from Gilbert. Resorts and most
of the homes on the islands received only minor damage, he said.
   ``Things should be back to almost normal for visitors by Monday
or Tuesday,'' Bodden said at a news conference. He flew to Miami
after waiting out the hurricane in the Caymans.
   He said government officials next week will examine whether the
hurricane damaged the islands' reefs, one of the Caribbean's most
popular diving spots. Bodden estimated tourism, the country's
biggest industry, brings about $145 million annually.
