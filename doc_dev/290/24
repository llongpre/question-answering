   A travel service that arranges trips to Cuba for
Cuban exiles has been bombed, the 11th attack in two years on
agencies that handle passengers and packages bound for the
communist island.
   Federal and local authorities said Monday they are renewing
their investigation of the case.
   Militant anticommunist Cuban exiles are the prime suspects in
the bombings.
   Just before midnight Sunday two small bombs blasted holes in the
outside wall of Marazul Charters, the only company authorized to
handle trips for Cuban exiles wanting to visit their homeland. No
one was hurt, but the explosion also shattered a window and light
fixtures in businesses across a narrow canal.
   ``We're actively investigating, but we haven't identified a
suspect yet,'' said George Kiszynski, spokesman for the Miami FBI
office. He said the Metro-Dade police bomb squad was gathering
evidence to identify the detonation method for the two bombs.
   There have been 13 similar bombings in the Miami area over the
last two years _ 11 at agencies doing business with Cuba, one aimed
at an art museum showing work by Cuban artists and one at the home
of the sponsor of a forum on U.S.-Cuban relations.
   Marazul's owner, Francisco Aruca, has spoken in favor of closer
relations with Cuba, an anathema to some in Miami's anti-Castro
community.
   The bombings were the work of ``fanatical and radical elements
in the community,'' Aruca said Monday. ``Anyone who perceives a
softening of the attitude toward a dialogue with Castro can expect
to have that happen to them.''
   The bombing apparently did not frighten off Marazul's customers,
who often have to wait months for seats on the twice-a-week charter
flights to visit relatives in Cuba.
   ``My husband would like to see his mother before she dies,''
Hilda Aybar said while waiting in front of the agency. ``I don't
see why he shouldn't go.''
   Threats phoned to Marazul and other agencies criticize them for
indirectly supporting Castro by providing hard currency to Cuba,
and more broadly by softening attitudes toward the communist
government.
   The latest bombing came three days after another Miami agency
announced the first direct mail to Cuba, and two weeks after the
Kiwanis Club of Little Havana, which sponsored Miami's Calle Ocho
street party, caused a controversy by banning any singers who had
performed in Cuba.
