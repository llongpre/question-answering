  [Text] Kingston, 2 Jun (PL) -- Jamaican Prime Minister 
Percival Patterson has confirmed, here before Parliament, that 
his government will allow the United States to use Jamaican 
territory to process Haitians intercepted on the high seas. 
  The next group of Haitians detained on the high seas will be 
taken to Jamaica, where U.S. vessels anchored in the ports of 
Kingston, Port Antonio, and Montego Bay will be converted into 
floating platforms to conduct interviews and to provide 
temporary shelter for those seeking asylum. 
  Reports from Washington note that the U.S. Navy hospital 
ship 
"Comfort," with a capacity of 1,000 beds, has sailed from 
Norfolk, Virginia, for Kingston and that another vessel, flying 
the Ukrainian flag, may also leave Tampa en route to Kingston. 
  Labor leader Edward Seaga voiced opposition to the 
government's decision. Although he stressed he supported Bill 
Clinton's change in policy of not returning the Haitians without 
a preliminary hearing, he said it was unacceptable to use 
Jamaican territory to do this. 
  Patterson disclosed that on Wednesday, U.S. and Jamaican 
specialists worked out a bilateral memorandum of understanding 
to outline each side's responsibility and in which the White 
House has promised to pay all operational expenses for the six 
months Jamaica has granted. 
  Some observers believe strong pressure has been exerted on 
Jamaica, which opposed this idea at the beginning, but the 
presence of a high-level delegation proved that the report was 
not merely media rumors. The delegation included U.S. Under 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; William H. Gray, President 
Clinton's special adviser on Haitian affairs; and eight other 
officials. 
  Several analysts believe there is a consensus among members 
of the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) on the commitment they 
must make as a regional organization to resolve the Haitian 
crisis and to help President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to 
his post as well as to cooperate in reestablishing democracy in 
the neighboring country.
