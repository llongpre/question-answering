JAMAICA was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1494. It has 120 rivers,
more botanical gardens than any other Caribbean island, and what seem to be
more churches per mile than any other country. It is 145 miles from east to
west and 51 miles at its widest. But it does not have many golf courses.
I was there to watch the world championship being played at the Tryall golf,
tennis and beach club. But it was not long before I decided I was not going
to be outdone by the likes of Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Ian Woosnam and Seve
Ballesteros. If they could play golf in the pleasant 80`F heat, then so
could I.
At the Wyndham Rose Hall resort course, near Montego Bay, the woman in the
pro shop seemed concerned only to take my money. 'Where do I change?' I
asked. 'There,' she replied, gesticulating at a bench outside.
The two nines of this 6,617-yard course are as different as chalk and
cheese. The first is flat and the holes run side by side. The seventh is a
good, short hole of 170 yards: you aim at the sea. The eighth is even
better: a par four that curves around a bay, it resembles the 18th at Pebble
Beach except that it is 200 yards shorter.
Children sit on a sea wall, smiling. As you walk past, they chant: 'I am
going in the sea.' Which is exactly what I did, after hooking my drive. A
few minutes later, the children approached and sold the ball back to me.
The later holes on the back nine reminded me of the Nuwara Eliya course in
the highlands of Sri Lanka. Vegetation crawled up and down the sides of the
surrounding mountains. Standing on the 15th tee, no humans could be seen.
The course at the Half Moon golf, tennis and beach club was laid out by
Robert Trent Jones in the early 1960s. It is just across the road from the
famous hotel and resort, and six miles east of Montego Bay.
Nearly all the the holes have slight kinks, which helps to make them long
and demanding. The point, however, is that even when the trade winds are
blowing, they are just about playable. More than 30,000 rounds each year are
played at Half Moon, half by Europeans and Japanese.
'Jamaica is moving forward,' says Heinz Simonitsch, the Austrian managing
director of Half Moon. 'The economy is on the up, even though Jamaicans are
never on time. They could never stage a revolution: if it was due to start
at 6pm, they would not arrive until 9pm.'
Simonitsch tells how tennis expanded at his hotel. 'We used to have two
tennis courts but that was not enough, so I built two more. Then three more,
and I thought that must surely be enough. It was not. I added four more -
with lights - and still the demand exceeded supply. I built two more, so now
we have 13 in all and seven are lit.
'Golf is getting a little like that. Until 1985, we had paid little
attention to it but, since then, we have spent Dollars 3m on improving the
facilities.'
I would not mind if I never played Wyndham Rose Hall again. But I would be
sad if I could not have another round at Half Moon, followed by lunch at a
restaurant overlooking the beautiful bay from which it gets its name.
