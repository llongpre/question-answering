<LEADPARA>  BUOYED by expectations for Cuba's budding tourism industry, new charter
services offering trips to Cuba are popping up around the Caribbean.;    It is
not known how many Americans have taken advantage of the new services to visit
the island in defiance of United States law.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Americans, who are prohibited under a trade embargo from spending money
in Cuba, appear to make up a significant portion of some of the business.;   
"If they have a legitimate passport we let them go. The Cubans are fairly
liberal about who they let in," said Lionel Carey, president of Bahatours,
which operates charters from Nassau to Havana.;    Traveling to Cuba is fairly
simple, he said. "We have the visas right here in the office. We can take any
ordinary old guy over for the weekend." Among the travelers that Bahatours has
been told it can't accept without prior authorization from Cuba are Americans
who were born in Cuba.;    "The main patrons are Americans who have the
excitement of seeing what the hell is going on in Cuba," Frank Pringle,
Jamaica's tourism minister, said, referring to charters from Montego Bay to
Santiago de Cuba. "The Cubans say, 'You want your passport stamped, or don't
you?' ";    The surge of charter flights to Cuba comes as interest in the
island is growing among European and Latin American airlines. Some European
air operators predict that Cuba, with comparatively low prices, may soon
become a major destination for Europeans who now vacation in Spain, Turkey and
the Greek islands.;    "People have been there so many times. Service in Spain
has declined, and prices have gone sky high and people are getting tired of
it," said Henk Guitjens, vice president and general manager for North America
of Martinair Holland, a Dutch charter airline.;    "We feel that ultimately
Cuba could be the biggest destination for Europeans in the Caribbean,"
Guitjens said.;    Capturing a chunk of the European travel market would be a
big boost for the Cuban economy, which has declined dramatically with the
breakup of the Soviet Union's trading bloc.;    Gaining a hold on the U.S.
tourist market would be an even greater benefit. Before the Cuban revolution,
Americans accounted for the bulk of tourists in Cuba. But except for a brief
period in the 1970s and early '80s when the United States allowed travel
restrictions imposed shortly after the 1959 revolution to lapse, the U.S.
government's trade embargo has effectively killed any possibility of a tourism
influx from the United States.;    Under the embargo, Americans may travel to
Cuba, but with the exception of certain people, including journalists and
Cuban Americans visiting family, they may not spend any money there.;    But
some Americans have discovered that for the most part Caribbean tour operators
are unconcerned about carrying U.S. citizens on their charter flights, and
they're taking advantage of the surge in service.;    Charter air services to
Cuba now are available from Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and
Mexico. Also, tour operators in half a dozen countries are selling packages
that include stops in Cuba and other island destinations.;    There has been
charter service between the Dominican Republic and Cuba since 1988, even
though the two countries don't maintain diplomatic relations.;    U.S.
Treasury officials, charged with enforcing the trade embargo, are not pleased
with the prospect that some Americans may be using Caribbean destinations as a
back-door entry point to Cuba. But they have so far taken no apparent steps to
stop the trips.;    "Clearly (they) are violating our regulations," a Treasury
official said of Americans traveling to Cuba. Of the tour operators, the same
official said: "Foreign companies engaged in routine transportation of
Americans to Cuba are running the risk of . . . having any future business
dealings with the United States prohibited.";    But charter operators are
enthusiastic about the Cuban market.;    Rollin Jackson, a Cayman Island
businessman, organized his first charter flight from the Caymans to Cuba in
February. He plans to offer all-inclusive four-day, three-night packages with
stops in Cayo Largo, off Cuba's southern coast, and Havana for $720 during
most holiday periods.;    Other Caribbean tour operators offering packages to
Cuba include:;    (check) BAHATOURS -- The Nassau-based company started
offering three-day to weeklong packages to Havana in December, suspended them
during the Persian Gulf war and recently started up again. A three-day weekend
package, including a stay at Havana's finest new property, the seaside
Commodoro villas, is $299 per person.;    (check) SUN HOLIDAY TOURS -- The
company offers one-day jaunts to Santiago de Cuba from Montego Bay in Jamaica
and hopes to expand to two-day trips.;    Although weekly commercial air
service links Kingston and Cuba, the operation's inauguration in December
marked the first charter flight between Cuba and Jamaica in more than 10
years.;    (check) EMELY TOURS -- Each Sunday a Cubana airline plane lands in
the Dominican Republic at the Santo Domingo Las Americas International Airport
and returns to Cuba about two hours later. Europeans who have bought package
tours for a week in the Dominican Republic and a week in Cuba account for
about 25 percent of the travelers on the charter flights, said Julio Rosario,
president of Emely Tours. Dominicans account for nearly 50 percent.;    About
20 percent of the passengers are Dominicans traveling to Cuba for annual
checkups, operations, coronary problems and treatment of kidney stones. At one
time they might have traveled to the United States for the same treatments,
but the unfavorable dollar-Dominican peso exchange rate makes it too expensive
for many Dominicans.;    Meanwhile, Cuba is engaged in a hotel building flurry
and is courting foreign investors to pump up a tourism industry that
languished after the revolution.;    By 1993, Cuba hopes to attract more than
500,000 tourists (compared to 326,000 in 1989). The target for 1995 is 1.5
million.;     If you go . . .; THESE are restrictions on travel by Americans
to Cuba, according to the U.S. State Department:;    (check) U.S. RESTRICTIONS
-- Travel is allowed by government officials or officials of intergovernmental
organizations on official business; for reunification with close relatives; by
certain professional researchers; and by news media personnel. A specific U.S.
permit is not required.;    Travel may be authorized for other humanitarian
reasons or for public exhibitions or performances, with decisions made on a
case-by-case basis. Permission is required from the Licensing Division, Office
of Foreign Asset Control, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave.
NW, Treasury Annex, Washington, D.C. 20220; telephone (202) 535-9449, or fax
(202) 377-7222.;    U.S. citizens visiting Cuba are advised to register with
the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, telephone 320-551, 320-541 or 329-700.; 
  (check) CUBAN RESTRICTIONS -- The government of Cuba considers all
Cuban-born U.S. citizens and possibly their children to be solely Cuban
citizens. The Cuban government does not recognize the right of the U.S.
government to protect dual U.S.-Cuban citizens.;    Dual nationals may be
subject to a range of restrictions and obligations, including military service
in Cuba. They are required by Cuban law to enter and depart Cuba using Cuban
passports.;    Using a Cuban passport for this purpose does not jeopardize
one's U.S. citizenship. However, such people must use their U.S. passports to
enter and depart the United States and any other countries en route.; --
