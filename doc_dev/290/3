   Eight soldiers who trained Jamaican
troops after the 1983 Grenada invasion have been indicted by a
federal grand jury for allegedly submitting thousands of dollars in
false travel vouchers to the Army.
   The Special Forces soldiers from Fort Bragg, who were
temporarily housed in the Americana Hotel in Ochos Rios, Jamaica,
allegedly conspired to receive two sets of receipts. One showed the
amount actually paid for their rooms, $27.50; the second showed
that the hotel received $55.
   The indictment, handed down Tuesday, said that just before or
immediately after returning to Fort Bragg in May 1984, the eight
destroyed the receipts that reflected what was actually paid.
   They then filled out false travel vouchers that showed they paid
the greater amount and were reimbursed, according to the indictment.
   Each of the eight was indicted on a single count of conspiring
to defraud the United States, along with a second count of
submitting a false claim for reimbursement of lodging expenses.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Raleigh said the
conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison,
a fine of up to $250,000, or both.
   The false claim charge carries a maximum of five years in prison
and a fine of up to twice what was taken, or $250,000, or both, the
spokesman said.
   The indictment alleged that the eight were assigned in December
1983 to Jamaica to provide trained personnel to serve as security
forces for the government of Grenada following the invasion of that
country two months before. The eight returned to Fort Bragg in May
1984.
