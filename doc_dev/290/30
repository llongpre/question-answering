  [Text] Kingston (NICA)--The Customs Department and the 
Narcotics Police Division have their hands full these days 
detecting cocaine being smuggled to Jamaica from Panama, Curacao 
and Colombia by paid "mules" (female couriers). 
  The smugglers target especially, the COPA flight from 
Panama, 
ALM from Curacao, and SAM from Colombia. 
  The female cocaine smugglers, who hide the drug in body 
cavities, are reported to be paid US$200 each when they deliver 
the drug intact. On the average, each packet recovered from 
vaginal searches weigh 14 ounces. The search is always done by a 
doctor. 
  A Customs Department spokesman explains: "Once we target 
them 
and take them down to the search room, the doctor does all the 
searching. And we have all the equipment, forceps and boxes and 
boxes of sterilized gloves." The spokesman pointed out that 
although the law states that a female customs officer could 
search a female patient, the internal searches are done by 
female doctors only. 
  On being recruited here as couriers, most of the women, 
first-time travellers, claim they are higglers going to buy 
goods abroad. Their airfares are paid and they are provided with 
accommodation, food and ground transport in the country where 
they go to pick up the cocaine. Usually, they go and return on 
SAM, COPA or ALM. Usually, the recruiter travels to Jamaica on 
the return flight with them, having supplied them with the drug 
in the source country. Once they arrive here safely with the 
drug--that is they clear Customs and the Narcotics Police 
without the cocaine being discovered--they are paid. 
  Men are recruited as couriers too, their method of choice 
being swallowing balls of cocaine in condoms. Men and women 
couriers smuggle the cocaine in autoparts, and other 
merchandise, in bath soaps, in hollowed-out custom-built clothes 
hangers, in wig and sneakers or submerging it in cooking oil. 
  Of nine women targeted by Customs in September as "mules," 
six were held. But three escaped. In September, four men 
suspected of having swallowed cocaine balls in condoms escaped 
from the Cornwall Regional Hospital, Montego Bay, by jumping 
through a window. A man who arrived at Sangster International 
Airport, Montego Bay, on the SAM flight from Colombia, the same 
month, was found to have swallowed 63 pieces of crack cocaine. 
  Estimated street value of cocaine in Jamaica now is $200,000 
to $230,000 a kilo. In 1992 when cocaine was more plentiful, the 
price was $180,000 a kilo. 
  Wily cocaine smugglers change their techniques frequently, 
but the Customs Department and the Narcotics Police catch on 
just as fast. 
  Women smugglers started another trend recently--smuggling 
cocaine in lotion bottles having liquefied it. The result is 
that Customs is now giving these lotion bottles a more-than 
cursory check. 
  Then there is the "internal conspiracy" at the island's two 
international airports, the Norman Manley in Kingston, and the 
Sangster, Montego Bay, whereby the courier, by prior 
arrangement, deposits the cocaine in the female toilet or in 
flower pots, and employees there pick it up. 
  And ganja trafficking continues to be a problem, showing up 
more frequently these days in mailbags bound for the U.S.A., 
especially from the Norman Manley International Airport. Random 
probes with sharp instruments of "normally wrapped parcels" in 
mailbags have been turning up ganja. 
  Drug smuggling continues on other fronts too, targeting in 
particular legitimate exports such as ground provisions. 
  "The ganja is smuggled in every section of an empty 
container 
that you can think of--the ceiling, the floor, the walls," the 
Customs spokesman said. 
  "Then they are put in drums, labelled something else and 
shipped. But the smuggler's choice these days for getting out 
the ganja, is in scrap metal, because it is so difficult to 
handle."
