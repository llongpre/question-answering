<TEXT>     The Ecstasy, based in Miami, will begin seven-day cruises June 2,
alternating between the eastern and western Caribbean. Eastern Caribbean ports
of call include San Juan and St. Thomas; western Caribbean ports are Playa del
Carmen, Cozumel, Grand Cayman and Ocho Rios.;    Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's
2,350-passenger Monarch of the Seas will begin cruising in November. Its
sister, Sovereign of the Seas, set the cruise industry on its ear when it
appeared in January 1988 with a five-story atrium lobby served by two glass
elevators.;    A similar atrium with rushing fountains, sweeping bronze
staircases and glass elevators also will be the hub of activities for Monarch
of the Seas, which will be based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It will make
seven-day round-trip cruises every Sunday to the southern Caribbean, calling
at Martinique, Barbados, Antigua, St. Maarten and St. Thomas.;    More than
7,200 berths;  These two huge ships account for the greater part of the
7,200-plus new berths that will be added to the cruise industry's collective
fleet, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. Last year,
about 11,000 new berths were added.;    Among other ships scheduled to make
their debuts this year:;    (box) Princess Cruises' 1,590-passenger Regal
Princess, in July. This sister ship to the Crown Princess will do seven-day
eastern and western Caribbean sailings round trip from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; 
  (box) Renaissance Cruises' Renaissance VI, in May, and Renaissance VII, in
December. (Renaissance V was launched in March but will be chartered through
1991.) The ships, all under 300 feet long, have 57 all-outside suites. Their
shallow drafts allow navigation into more remote waters and ports that larger
cruise ships can't maneuver. Itineraries cover 10 regions: Far East, Asian
islands, Black Sea/Red Sea, India, Mediterranean, Europe, Scandinavia, Africa,
South America and the Caribbean.;    Deluxe expeditions;  (box) Society
Expeditions' Society Adventurer, in July. This is the first of two new
160-passenger deluxe expedition ships for the adventure-cruise company, which
for the first time will offer a series of shorter excursions designed to fit
two-week vacation schedules.;    (box) Star Clipper, in July. This 357-foot
four-masted sailing ship will accommodate 180 passengers in 90 double cabins.
The ship will make seven-day Caribbean sailings.;    The Cruise Lines
International Association estimates some 4 million people will sail on ships
this year.  </TEXT>
