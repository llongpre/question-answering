   Travelers going abroad may want to adjust their schedules to
take part in festivals and events at destination points. Some
highlights:
   Carnival Time, Jamaica, April 14-22. This is the first combined
celebration of Jamaica Carnival and Orange Carnival, with
activities planned island-wide. The week-long Carnival Time begins
with a street parade of costumed groups in Montego Bay and includes
a ``Family Affair'' carnival at Albion Farms in St. Mary and a
kiddie carnival and reggae rhythm street dance in Kingston. For
more information, contact the Jamaica Tourist Board, (212)
688-7650. _
   Antigua Sailing Week, Antigua, B.W.I., April 21-May 5. The
annual yacht and sailing regatta for ocean-going yachts can be seen
from Shirley Heights on the island's south coast. Despite its name,
the event lasts two weeks and features seven major races, climaxed
by Lord Nelson's Ball on May 5. _
   Chelsea Flower Show, London, May 22-25. This is the world's
largest and arguably most famous flower show, set on the grounds of
the historic Royal Hospital in the Chelsea district on the Thames
River embankment. Intermingling scents of ornamental and practical
plants traditional in 16th century gardens will be a feature of the
Tudor garden being exhibited by Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, the British
toiletries firm. The garden has been designed by Jane
Fearnley-Whittingstall, whose ``Sudeley Castle Rose Garden'' won a
gold medal at last year's show, and will feature apple, raspberry
and strawberry blossoms mixed with damask roses, lilacs and
philadelphus. Rosemary, sage, sweet cecily and camomile sward will
divide the beds into a knot pattern of roses and germander, with
lavender, clove pink and viburnum added for even more fragrance.
C&amp;E says that after the show it will donate the garden to the
London Lighthouse, an AIDS hospice. _
   The Meeting of the Worlds Festival, Joensuu, Finland, June
19-23. Scheduled during Finland's ``white midsummer nights,'' this
international music, dance, theater, art and film festival will
wind up in Sortavala, across the border on the Soviet side. The
Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the Kronos Quartet headline
the music program, and the film competition will be devoted to
documentaries about peace. Co-organizers are PAND International
(Performers and Artists for Nuclear Disarmament) and the annual
Joensuu Song Festival organization, who will donate proceeds to
UNICEF. For more information call the Finnish Tourist Board in New
York at (212) 949-2333. _
   Carnival, St. George's, Grenada, W.I., Aug. 11-14. This is
Grenada's largest celebration, which wakes up with a 5 a.m. cannon
firing at Ft. George and continues with costumed revellers with
``Ole Mas'' placards, Calypso music in Queen's Park, and the Parade
of Bands leading the traditional ``jump up'' through the streets of
the city. _
