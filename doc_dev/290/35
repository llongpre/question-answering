   In an event that would have been almost unthinkable
a year ago, Miami's militantly anti-communist Cuban leaders are
playing host for a weekend of meetings, seminars and parties with
visiting Soviet officials.
   Soviet political advisers, including five members of the Supreme
Soviet, will stop here Saturday and Sunday to talk with community
leaders before attending next week's Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting
in Washington.
   ``The Cold War is really over. It's a new era,'' said Soviet
delegate Andrei Kortunov.
   In the past, Miami has been the site of a militant, sometimes
violent brand of anti-communism. A Polish vessel was hit with a
homemade bazooka in 1968, the city tried to ban Miss Yugoslavia
from an international beauty pageant here, and as recently as last
year, Miami's Calle Ocho street festival barred anyone who had ever
performed in Cuba. Businesses and museums that do business with
Cuba have been bombed.
   But Cuban community leaders, including Mayor Xavier Suarez and
Jorge Mas Canosa, the head of the anti-Castro Cuban American
National Foundation, agree that the world has changed.
   ``The time has come to take risks,'' Mas said. ``We have a great
opportunity to convey to the Soviet people that we Cuban-Americans
are not the enemy.
   The event, called the Moscow in Miami Pre-Summit, gets under way
officially on Saturday. It includes seminars on regional conflicts
and superpower relations, sessions on glasnost and tips on how to
do business in the Soviet Union.
   There is also a lighter side, including a party in cowboy hats
at Regine's nightclub and sightseeing for the Soviets.
   Cuban-American leaders here, heartened by the strained relations
between Mikhail Gorbachev and Fidel Castro, hope to take advantage
of the Soviets' presence to persuade them to stop subsidizing Cuban
communism.
   The Soviets in turn are seeking landing rights for the national
airline Aeroflot in this gateway to Latin America.
   Kortunov said moves toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union
have changed the way people in his country see Miami.
   ``The basic vision of Miami was as a city of racial tension, a
city of Cuban criminals and a place where American millionaires can
come to enjoy life at the beach,'' he said.
   ``Now the image of Miami is changing. We understand that Miami
is the unofficial capital of the Caribbean. We also should change
our attitudes about Cuban immigrants here.''
