   Tourists are flying out and medicine,
plastic tents and food are pouring in at Jamaica's two
international airports as this island nation struggles to recover
from the fury of Hurricane Gilbert.
   Little by little, Jamaica, home to 2.3 million people, is
struggling back from the worst disaster in its history. But it's
going to be a slow and painful process.
   The confirmed death toll of 26 was low in comparison with
Hurricane Charlie, which hit Jamaica in 1951 and killed more than
150 people. But Charlie caused less physical damage. Prime Minister
Edward Seaga has estimated losses at $8 billion and called Gilbert
the worst disaster in the nation's history.
   The government say 500,000 people, or two-fifths of the
population, have been left homeless after the hurricane roared down
the spine of the 144-mile-long island on Monday. Four out of every
five houses were either damaged or destroyed as Gilbert's 145 mph
winds tore away zinc roofs as if they were plastic sheets.
   Ninety-three percent of the island still had no electricity
Saturday, although power was restored in the northern coast city of
Montego Bay, the main tourist area.
   The power failure cut off fresh water supplies to most of the
island, including Kingston, a city of 750,000 people, because the
pumping and filtration plants run on electricity. Power was not
expected to be fully restored to the capital for at least two weeks.
   Crowds gathered around water hydrants and burst mains in
90-degree heat, filling plastic buckets and old milk containers.
Reports from the countryside said people were taking water from
muddy streams, despite the hazard of contamination.
   Radio stations carried a taped message every half hour from the
health minister, Dr. Kenneth Baugh, warning people to boil drinking
water, and millions of water purification tablets were being
airlifted in from around the world.
   Looting of stores, warehouses and supermarkets in the first days
after the hurricane forced the government to impose a night curfew,
which was still in effect at the end of the week. People who failed
to stock up before the storm rushed supermarkets and gasoline
stations, forming long lines outside both. Armed soldiers were seen
regulating the flow of shoppers in and out of a supermarket outside
Kingston.
   On Thursday, Seaga declared a 30-day state of public emergency,
ordering stores and gasoline stations to reopen and giving security
forces ``full'' but unspecified power to ensure that they did.
   The emergency order also gave the government the right to seize
transportation and heavy equipment to distribute supplies arriving
from around the world.
   The loss to agriculture is severe. Government officials said the
poultry industry and this years's crop of bananas and coffee were
wiped out.
   Seaga told reporters Friday that he would discuss the disaster
with world bank officials next week, but had no plan to ask for a
rescheduling of Jamaica's $4 billion foreign debt.
   The disaster hit just as Jamaica was showing signs of recovery
from economic distress brought on by a worldwide slump in the value
of bauxite, sugar and other commodities.
   In addition, tourism _ now the nation's biggest foreign exchange
earner at $550 million a year _ had staged a remarkable recovery as
a result of an intense campaign to rid the island of its reputation
for political violence.
   Although four major hotels in Montego Bay were heavily damaged,
Seaga said the area was making a quick recovery and the tourist
industry was generally in good shape.
   Elections are due in Jamaica by next March, and Seaga, who is
seeking a second consecutive term, has consistently trailed former
Prime Minister Michael Manley in opinion polls. There was
speculation that his handling of the hurricane disaster could tip
the balance.
