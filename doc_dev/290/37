   Prime Minister Edward Seaga declared a
major section of hurricane-devastated Jamaica a disaster area on
Thursday, and police were empowered to force stores to open quickly
to avoid shortages.
   The area contains more than 1 million of this Caribbean island
nation's 2.3 million people and embraces four of Jamaica's 14
parishes, or counties, on the badly hit east coast _ Kingston, St.
Andrew, St. Catherine and St. Thomas.
   Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast that the one-month
``period of public emergency'' was put into effect ``to enable
normalcy to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the
rebuilding process to begin.''
   He continued a dusk-to-dawn curfew established in Kingston
earlier this week to prevent looting.
   At least 26 people were killed when Hurricane Gilbert, the
strongest storm this century, swept through Jamaica on Monday, the
government-run Jamaica Information Service reported. Officials fear
the toll will mount as communication is re-established with the
interior.
   Five people were reported killed in the Dominican Republic and
10 in Haiti, where the military government declared its own state
of emergency on the wrecked southern peninsula.
   Seaga said the international airport at Montego Bay had reopened
to all traffic and the Norman Manley International Airport at
Kingston will resume full operations shortly. Three commercial
airlines were flying out of Kingston airport Thursday.
   The information service said a period of public emergency is the
equivalent of a declaration of a disaster area in the United States
and is not a state of emergency ``in any form whatsoever.''
   Under the emergency regulations, police can force gas stations
and all stores selling food, hardware, drugs and fuel to open
Friday morning and all other stores to open as soon as electricity
is available.
   ``The failure of shops to reopen has placed an unbearable burden
on official sources to provide meals through centers of refuge,''
Seaga said.
   Women and children carried plastic containers of water on their
heads and stood in line at service stations for kerosene with which
to cook what food could be found.
   A helmeted soldier with a rifle and a German shepherd guard dog
stood outside the Hometride Bakery and Food Centre, controlling the
number of people allowed inside.
   ``There is a possibility, a very real possibility, of a (food)
shortage, particularly of chicken,'' said Jean Lewis, director of
public affairs for the Jamaican Information Service. ``Supermarkets
are still pretty well stocked, but how long that will remain the
case is another matter.''
   It was sunny and humid in the capital, which was still littered
with zinc roofing, toppled utility poles and other storm debris.
   A government spokeswoman said there had been some looting right
after the hurricane winds died down, but it appeared to be under
control.
   The capital's two radio stations broadcast advisories to boil
water and not to touch downed telephone or power lines, and passed
along personal messages to remote regions of the country.
   By Thursday only 10 percent of Jamaica's telephones were back in
service. said Marge Boberschmidt, a spokeswoman for American
Telephone and Telegraph.
   AT&amp;T secured a single telephone line in Jamaica Wednesday night
and began relaying one-page messages from stranded Americans to
worried friends and relatives back home.
   Ms. Lewis estimated 93 percent of the island was still without
electricity. Stores and hotels used gasoline-powered generating
plants. The 18-floor Pegasus Hotel, popular with visiting
businessmen, was dimly lit and without elevator service.
   Seaga estimated the hurricane damage in Jamaica at $8 billion.
Relief supplies began arriving Thursday for some of the country's
half-million homeless.
   Sports stadiums, churches, government buildings and movie
theaters were used to house an estimated 150,000 people, the
government said.
   The government has said about 500,000, or more than one-fifth of
the Jamaican population was homeless. Seaga estimated 100,000 of
the island's 500,000 homes were completely wiped out and an
additional 300,000 had roofs ripped off or other severe damage.
   Gilbert strengthened from a tropical storm into a hurricane
Saturday night 160 miles south of Puerto Rico. It skirted the
Dominican Republic and Haiti on Sunday, plowed straight through
Jamaica on Monday, brushed past the Cayman Islands Tuesday and
slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday morning. The hurricane
on Thursday was headed toward northern Mexico and southeastern
Texas.
