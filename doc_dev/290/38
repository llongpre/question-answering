MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbus called this bay El Golfo de Buen Tiempo because of the fair weather he 
encountered, but 16th-Century Spaniards changed it to Bahia de Mantega, or 
"lard bay," because of their brisk trade in shipping the clarified fat. Somehow 
the unromantic latter name evolved into Montego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The British arrived in 1655 and, with cannons blazing, routed the Spaniards. 
They held onto Jamaica until the island gained independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's economy hit the doldrums when the sugar and bauxite markets fell. 
Then the north coast came to the rescue with tourism, and this stretch of beach 
became the standard bearer. 
</P>
<P>
What captivated Columbus and countless visitors since him about this spot are 
its colors: ribbons of cobalt-aqua-turquoise water along the shoreline, endless 
white beaches fringed with lush green rain forest, flaming bougainvillea, 
poinciana and hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Air Jamaica nonstop, or Eastern, American or Northwest with 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Unless you're stopping at other Jamaican resorts, plan on at 
least a week to soak up plenty of sun and get into the laid-back life style. 
High-season lodging costs (mid-December until April 30) climb pretty high, but 
dining is a bargain year-round. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Jamaican dollar recently traded at 6.4 to ours, about 
15.6 cents each. Weather is balmy to hot all year, with October and May the 
wettest months. Even then, rains do not last long. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel Gloucestershire (Gloucester Avenue; $105 to $125 
double, high season; $70-$90 low) is in midtown, just across the street from a 
very popular beach. Most of the hotel's 88 air-conditioned rooms have balconies 
overlooking the bay, and there's also a pool and Jacuzzi. The Gloucestershire 
puts you near the center of things, with a short walk to shops, restaurants and 
the town market. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Inn (Rose Hall; $128-$159 double, winter; $96-$118 summer) is a huge, 
eight-building complex with four dining rooms, half a dozen bar-lounges, 
enormous pool and its own beach. Nothing intimate about this one, but you'll 
find every activity under the sun here and tennis at night. There's also 
nightly dancing and entertainment. Bedrooms are generous in size, each with a 
balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Cariblue Beach Hotel (Ironshore; $75-$82 double winters; $55-$60 summers) is 
our budget special, an older and modest-but-comfortable place right on the 
water. Its King Arthur's restaurant and bar is a local gathering place, and 
you'll find it tough to beat these prices. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Read any menu in Jamaica and you're sure to see two 
staples: callaloo (spinach-like greens) and ackee, a rather bland pod fruit. 
The former is eaten straight, or made into hot or cold soups. Ackee mixed with 
salt fish (cod) comes close to being the national dish. 
</P>
<P>
Jerk pork or chicken gets its name from the distinct preparation: the meat is 
scored, ladled with a paste made of ground scallions, hot pimento pepper and 
thyme, allowed to marinate, then barbecued slowly. The glorious results are 
unlike any meat you've ever tasted. If you wish to try making it at home, pick 
up a jar of Busha Browne's jerk seasoning and give it a go. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's Red Stripe beer is the perfect drink with jerk pork, and Appleton's 
rum is the island's finest. 
</P>
<P>
No mention of Jamaican potables is complete without several kudos to its Blue 
Mountain and High Mountain coffee. We picked up a pound each of the Martinez 
brand, which you'll find in gourmet shops at home. 
</P>
<P>
Fine dining: Stop in at the Pork Pit for your introduction to a super-heated 
version of jerk pork, chicken and fish, all eaten outside at long tables 
beneath the trees. 
</P>
<P>
The Pelican (Gloucester Avenue) has a coffee-shop atmosphere but excellent 
seafood. Its Cascade Room is more formal, with candlelight and waterfalls right 
outside the picture windows. Start with the smoked marlin or conch chowder, 
then have a go at one of the five lobster dishes. They also serve a wonderful 
curried goat, an island favorite. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian House (2 Orange St.) is a restored 18th-Century town house that is 
all elegance and grace. Dine in the lovely garden courtyard or among gleaming 
brass chandeliers and hurricane lamps, period furnishings, beautiful place 
settings and flowered draperies. A rather short menu offers select seafoods, 
plus such temptations as tournedos Rossini. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Half-Moon Club (Rose Hall; $240-$340 double, winter; 
$156-$180 summer) sits on 400 acres strung out along a mile of curving beach. 
The architecture and furnishings are a fetching mixture of an early Jamaican 
plantation house and 18th-Century English, with lots of white wicker furniture, 
Queen Anne reproductions and marvelous Jamaican art works. 
</P>
<P>
Most rooms are within 20 feet of the beach. There's a Robert Trent 
Jones-designed golf course and a dozen tennis courts on the property, plus a 
spa-gym, horseback riding and water sports. 
</P>
<P>
Take your evening meal on a broad terrace under an 80-year-old seagrape tree. 
Then get ready for a night of dancing, reggae music and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Schenke is both proprietor and chef de cusine of the Sugar Mill restaurant 
on the Half-Moon Club's golf course. Hans' kitchen takes the best and freshest 
of Jamaican ingredients and gives them a continental flair, such as perch 
poached in Vouvray wine and topped with an ackee sauce. His bar also whips up a 
Club House Special made with four kinds of rum camouflaged by fresh fruit 
juices. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: After your quota of beach time and water sports, take a morning 
trip to the produce and crafts markets, where native "higglers" bring their 
wares from outlying areas to sell to town folks and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Surely make time for a visit to Rose Hall, an 18th-Century "great house" once 
presided over by the infamous Annie Palmer, the "White Witch of Rose Hall," who 
legend says murdered three husbands (poison, stabbing and strangulation), took 
slaves as her lovers and murdered them as well when she tired of their favors. 
Enthusiastic Rose Hall docents will give you other gory details. 
</P>
<P>
If the reggae songs of Burning Spear, Jimmy Cliff, Tiger or Steel Pulse turn 
you on, you'll find the best music at Disco Inferno, Sir Winston or Rumours, 
starting very late at night. 
</P>
<P>
