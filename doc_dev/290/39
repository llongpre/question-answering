   Prime Minister Edward Seaga ordered
police to ensure that gasoline stations and stores open today after
Hurricane Gilbert pounded the island, killing at least 26 people
and leaving 500,000 homeless.
   Seaga declared much of the island a disaster area Thursday night
and invoked special emergency powers to push forward with an
enormous cleanup effort. The powers allow the government to
requisition private vehicles and heavy equipment to distribute
vital supplies to the hardest hit areas.
   ``The purpose of this period of public emergency is to ensure
the restoration of normality as quickly as possible in the most
affected areas,'' Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast.
   Gilbert pounded into Jamaica's east coast Monday, its 145 mph
winds smashing the length of the island, severely damaging or
destroying 80 percent of the country's 500,000 homes. Seaga
estimated damage at $8 billion, and officials estimated the death
toll could rise when they regain communications with the interior.
   Five people were reported killed in the Dominican Republic and
10 in Haiti, where the military government declared its own state
of emergency on the southern peninsula.
   The disaster area contains more than 1 million of this Caribbean
island nation's 2.3 million people and embraces four of Jamaica's
14 parishes, or counties, on the badly hit east coast _ Kingston,
St. Andrew, St. Catherine and St. Thomas.
   Seaga also authorized the police to see that gasoline stations
and stores selling food, hardware, drugs and fuel were opened for
business by 8 a.m. today.
   Even before Seaga's action, people were on the move, cleaning up
the damage. Telephone crews replaced snapped utility poles and set
up hundreds more that had lain toppled alongside or across just
about every street in Kingston, the capital.
   Phone service was re-established by midmorning in the Kingston
area, though lines destroyed in the island's eastern region were
expected to take months to replace.
   The Jamaican Defense Force, police, firefighters and rescue
crews were joined by thousands of volunteers in clearing streets
and sidewalks of debris _ trees, rocks, glass shards, bricks,
pieces of smashed furniture.
   Hundreds of foreign tourists stranded on the island by Gilbert
filled Kingston's battered Norman Manley Airport as commercial
flights resumed. At Montego Bay on the island's north side, the
international airport also resumed service.
   The prime minister appeared to acknowledge the volunteer spirit,
saying ``I expect full cooperation from the public so that none of
the emergency powers will have to be used. With full cooperation, I
expect that the period of public emergency will be brief.''
   Seaga said the government's top priorities are to provide
shelter for the homeless and assure adequate food supplies.
   Few downtown Kingston buildings escaped unscathed. The National
Gallery's windows were blown out, exposing paintings to passers-by
on the street.
   ``People are trying to do what they can do,'' said Kingston taxi
driver Samuel Alice. ``They're trying to get some food and trying
to get some shelter.''
   At the Pegasus, one of Kingston's luxury hotels, workers fished
deck chairs and tables from a swimming pool, while another crew
cleared the smashed remnants of its mammoth satellite dish.
   Nearby, two regulars determined to resume their daily routine
cleared away the blown-out roof of the hotel tennis clubhouse and
played three quick sets.
   With electricity still out Thursday night, stranded tourists in
Kingston sat in muggy, candlelit bars, sipping warm drinks and beer.
   Gilbert strengthened from a tropical storm into a hurricane
Saturday night 160 miles south of Puerto Rico. It skirted the
Dominican Republic and Haiti on Sunday, plowed straight through
Jamaica on Monday, brushed past the Cayman Islands Tuesday and
slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday morning. The hurricane
today headed toward northern Mexico and southeastern Texas.
