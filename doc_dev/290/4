Jamaica - James Henderson feels the fever and intensity

There is something theatrical about the streets of Jamaica. Much of
Caribbean life takes place outdoors anyway, and all West Indians are
demonstrative and lively, but in Jamaica things are more feverish and
intense. The shouting and quipping and carrying on, and the timing of
course, can seem almost like drama.
The scene was the Parade in downtown Kingston, where I was heading to catch
a bus. I was weaving through the stalls of Ben Dung Plaza (so called because
you literally do have to 'ben dung' to select your purchase from the piles
neatly laid out on the ground).
Vendors were shouting: 'Nuts] Wrigleys] Nuts]'; and they soon picked up on
me: 'Hey white man] Come] Come]' said a huge brown woman with a head-tie and
her skirts rolled up above her knees.
Like all the stalls, hers was laid out with meticulous care, almost colour
co-ordinated, the red and green of cut water-melon and little pyramids of
limes. Once she had my attention, and that of all the people around, she
said: 'Come daalin'. Come squeeze me mangos . . .'
But if I had momentarily forgotten that I was catching a bus, the busmen had
not, and as soon as I strayed on to their turf the barrage began: 'Yes man,
this way man.'
Three of them vied for my custom. Before I knew it, I had been hustled on
board the nearest minibus, to a chorus of mock outrage from the other
conductors. My intended destination seemed only a secondary consideration.
The victorious busman seemed almost disappointed when I explained that I did
not want to go uptown after all, but across to the north coast. I needed a
different bus station altogether.
Three hours later I was in Ocho Rios, cosseted in old-colonial luxury in the
Jamaica Inn, which is a far cry from downtown Kingston. It is an enclave of
manicured calm, purposely old-fashioned, one of a number of places in
Jamaica that appeal to an era now largely passed.
The grounds, complete with a sumptuous croquet lawn, are worthy of an
English country garden, though of course the image is instantly spiked by
the palm trees. You can begin to feel the romance of the West Indies here.
A famed devotee of Jamaica was Noel Coward, who kept a house called Firefly
just outside Ocho Rios for many years until his death in 1973. It was chosen
with customary discernment because it has one of the Caribbean's finest
views.
Looking from the open-fronted drawing room, you see the Blue Mountains
recede in their camel-back ridges for 30 miles to one side and on the
shoreline beneath them the headlands outreach one another into the distance.
It is essential to travel around the island to get the best of Jamaica, and
it was soon time to set out again. Suddenly, outside the hotel grounds, the
harsh voices of everyday Jamaican life re-appeared.
People were talking to each other with the excitability and volume of
football fans whose team has just won an important match. Through a car
window they had all the gestures of pantomime. In the mayhem of the market,
people nosed their handcarts through the crowds, goats dragged their tethers
oblivious, conductors leant out of their buses, fistfuls of notes folded
between their fingers, shouting their destinations: 'Brongstong]
Brongstong]' (Browns Town), 'Maubyer] Maubyer]' (Mo Bay - short for Montego
Bay in patois).
I found a seat on the bus and the vendors walked up and down: 'Box drink,
box drink, bag juice, bag juice.' The aisle steadily filled up with people
standing. It is normal practice to hand your shopping to someone sitting if
you have to stand. I was given a satchel of books, my next door neighbour
got a baby.
I enjoy riding the buses, unlike many Jamaicans, who think of them as an
unreliable necessity rather than an adventure. Outside, the world flashed
by: groups of schoolchildren darted here and there, shorts and pinafore
dresses colour-coded according to their school; a small house stood between
two vast stacks of speakers, music audible even above the bus's stereo, a
single man danced; a woman walked with a single hand of bananas on her head;
a boy rode his bicycle at an impossibly uncomfortable angle, poised as
though he were about to perform some complicated BMX trick - but no, he just
switched to the other side in some odd expression of symmetry.
Of course Jamaica is well known for hustling and there's no doubt that it
can be hard on an unwary newcomer. Some lock themselves away in hotels and
do not step outside the compound except in a taxi, but if you do, sooner or
later (usually sooner because they will pick you out if you have no tan) you
will have a run-in with a hustler. It starts with a question impossible to
answer: 'So wha' 'appenin?' and a hand upturned in question.
Once they have you there they talk you through it, running down their
inventory of desirable and less desirable goods and services, anything from
primitive art, or yet another African carving, to an aloe massage. They are
persuasive, there is no doubt, and some make a good living: 'if you have de
lyric . . .'
I stepped out of the bus in Montego Bay and it began at once: everywhere
there was a chorus of 'So, whacannadoferyer?' 'Wha' 'appenin?' and of course
the eternal: 'Wanna taxi buddy?'
A man approached flourishing a machete and said, 'So, white man, I chop you
a nut, right,' (double take). He deftly topped a coconut and handed it to
me. 'Just 50 Jamaican.' After about 10 minutes of talk I handed over 20
Jamaican dollars.
One of my favourite Caribbean towns, Negril, lies at the western limit of
Jamaica. It was well known in the 1960s when the hippies washed up here and
admired the sunset a lot.
With all the recent building it has become a little gentrified (it even has
a golf course now) but it still has a laid-back air.
And here things took a turn for the absurd. Flushed, I saw a hustler arrive
by canoe, briefcase in hand and dressed in a suit, trousers rolled up
against the waves. He struck a pose on the shore and stumbled through the
sand on his business.
By all accounts not many Jamaicans go out jogging: 'Well man, you know, it a
long way . . . an' it HOT]' And so as I was stretching my legs, heading out
of Negril at a jog, people stopped and stared, or looked up from their
dominoes, bemused.
One man shouted after me with unlikely urgency as I left the town limits:
'You cyaan go out there, man, you are go get chop' (momentary thoughts of a
coconut). A six year-old squeaked with excitement at the sight of me: 'Look,
look, white man runnin]' and followed on for 100 yards.
Further on, an old man summed it up with a dismissive wave and just three
words: 'Get a taxi.'
As the largest and most vibrant of the British Caribbean islands, Jamaica
has the greatest romantic allure. Local life is that much more pressurised,
but the calm is correspondingly more of a relief. It is easy to feel the
love affair beginning.
