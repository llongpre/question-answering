   Suspected smuggling coordinators for Colombia's
Medellin cocaine cartel have been charged with funneling the drug
through the Bahamas and the Florida Keys in exchange for air drops
of ice chests stuffed with cash.
   A federal indictment disclosed Thursday charges two members of
the cartel-leading Ochoa clan and 10 others helped smuggle almost 4
tons of cocaine from Colombia into the United States.
   Mauricio Ochoa, 32, is being held without bond in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of here. He has been in
custody since June 20.
   The second man, Fabio Enrique Ochoa, disappeared from his
suburban Miami condominium shortly after Mauricio Ochoa's arrest,
and authorities believe he fled to Colombia.
   The pair have been described by federal authorities as principal
smugglers for the Medellin cartel.
   A man named Fabio Ochoa is on a Justice Department list of 12 top
drug figures sought in the United States. But prosecutors are
uncertain if the Fabio Ochoa named in the indictment is the same
person, and also are not sure what the Ochoas' relationship to
cartel patriarch Fabio Ochoa Restrepo is.
   The indictment was unsealed after the arrest of a couple accused
of driving drug-bearing speedboats from the Bahamian island of Abaco
to Key Largo, prosecutors said.
   Once cocaine loads were safely ashore, the indictment said, a
plane dropped the smugglers' payment of $200,000 to $400,000, in
cash packed in plastic foam chests, at sea to be picked up by boat.
   The final load of $400,000 burst when it hit the water,
scattering loose bills across the water in July 1987 after the ring
had handled 7,700 pounds of cocaine, an affidavit said.
