   Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., is
inviting more than 100 colleagues on a taxpayer-financed trip to
Jamaica's Montego Bay next month, and he's apparently getting quite
a response.
   The trip, scheduled for Nov. 2-6 and intended to explore
Caribbean development issues, has attracted so much interest that
aides said they may not be able to accommodate everyone.
   By the time the Air Force jet leaves, however, aides expect no
more than 20 House members plus some spouses and staffers to be on
board. By Friday, the State Department, which handles travel
arrangements for congressional delegations going overseas, said it
only had the names of six people who were going.
   Crockett, chairman of the House subcommittee on Western
Hemisphere Affairs, did not respond to calls about the trip Friday.
   His office refused to release a copy of the invitation he sent
to as many as 150 House members, or a list of people who planned to
attend the long weekend event at Montego Bay's Half Moon Club.
   Victor Johnson, the staff director, said a final list of
participants probably would not be available until takeoff.
   The purpose of the trip is to try to get lawmakers in touch with
a wide variety of people, including academics, union heads and
farmers' and labor organizations, Johnson said.
   Steve Hellinger, co-director of the Development Group for
Alternative Policies Inc., a non-profit group that is sponsoring
the event, said the seminars and meetings are hard work. The
conference should not be considered play even though it is held at
a resort, he said.
   Atherton Martin, who works with Hellinger, said a number of
members of Congress had expressed interest in the trip, but his
group had ``been asked not to release names, given the whole things
with junkets and ethics.''
   The group provided an agenda for the five-day program.
   After arriving Nov. 2, participants are invited to a reception.
A series of speeches and conferences are scheduled for the next two
days, generally running from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   Sunday is a free day for recreation. On the final day, lawmakers
will receive a briefing from the U.S. Embassy staff before flying
back to Washington.
   The lawmakers will hear from Crockett and Michael Manley,
Jamaica's prime minister, before the seminars start.
   Topics include: ``Narcotics: Toward a new Understanding,'' a
panel discussion on ``Structural Adjustment and Debt,'' an open
discussion on ``Internal Constraints,'' and a presentation on
``Options and Strategies: Regional Development, Food Security and
the Role of Regional Institutions.''
   The Jamaica conference is an outgrowth of two earlier
conferences on Barbados attended by members of Congress. Rep. Dante
Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee
with responsibility for approving members' trips, attended the
Barbados conference in February 1988.
   But Barbara Burris, Fascell's spokeswoman, said her boss would
not travel to Jamaica this year. Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., who also
traveled to Barbados, declined the trip because of the upcoming New
York mayoral race, according to his assistant, Miles Lackey.
   Among those who intend on taking the trip are Rep. Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn., and Jaime Fuster, Puerto Rico's delegate in Congress,
their aides said.
   Frenzel is a member of the House Ways and Means' subcommittee on
trade, which had jurisdiction over the Caribbean Basin Initiative,
a stalled U.S. development plan for the region. He is also a
co-chairman of Friends of the Caribbean, a loosely knit task force
on the region.
   Both groups, as well as the subcommittee on the Western
Hemisphere, are expected to send members to Jamaica.
   Martin said the results of the Barbados conference have already
borne fruit: Crockett introduced a $93 million Caribbean aid
package which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate.
   Although the U.S. government picks up the cost of travel and
pays a per diem for members of Congress, the Development GAP raised
money for the conference, Hellinger said. Sources include
foundations, like the Carnegie Corp., and private contributions
from grassroots groups, such as churches, he said.
