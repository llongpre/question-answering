   For six couples, the memories of a
Jamaican vacation will include flying debris, quivering buildings,
water sloshing in toilet bowls and ocean foam splashing at their
hotel windows.
   The couples from Fernandina Beach, whose four-day holiday began
as a lark, were among thousands of travelers trapped on the island
by Hurricane Gilbert, one of the century's most violent storms.
   ``You couldn't see the ground from our room three stories
above,'' Jan Nabors, one of the group, recalled Thursday. ``You
couldn't see three or four feet in front of you on the balcony.''
   In Jamaica, where winds reached 175 mph, an estimated 500,000
people were left homeless and at least 26 were reported dead from
Gilbert, which passed directly over the island Monday.
   The Fernandina Beach couples attempted to leave Jamaica on
Sunday from Montego Bay, but high winds had already canceled the
flights.
   The tourists were told they would be evacuated from Sandal's
Royal Caribbean Hotel to a more secure structure. The next day, the
group was taken by bus to join about 1,500 tourists taking refuge
at the Wyndham Hotel, a seven-story structure about 300 feet from
the ocean.
   ``The air was white'' with foam blown from the sea, tourist John
Burbank said.
   ``On the ocean side, windows were being blown out,'' said Mrs.
Nabors' husband, Donald.
   Some of the group began to move out into the hotel hallways to
hide from flying glass if their windows burst, they said.
   At one point the windows in another room burst, the door was
blown off the hinges and the hallway walls began to lean inward
from the force of the wind, Nabors said.
   ``We saw the wall buckling in and when it started doing that, we
moved on down to the end of the hallway. We were getting away from
the ocean side of the hotel and going to the inland side.
   ``Once it blew out the windows, you could feel the whole
corridor vibrating,'' he said.
   Under the assault of the winds, the entire hotel shook, Mrs.
Nabors said.
   ``The water was sloshing out of the toilets,'' she said.
``That's shaking.''
   The couples arrived at Jacksonville International Airport on
Thursday.
   ``We're just glad to be alive,'' Nabors said as he walked off
the plane. ``It was a hell of a storm.''
