   Four alleged Colombian drug kingpins
face charges in U.S. indictments that resulted from testimony in the
1988 conviction of a leader of the Medellin drug cartel, Carlos
Lehder Rivas.
   The other reputed Medellin cartel leaders, Pablo Escobar Gaviria,
Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa
Vasquez, were on the ``most wanted'' list of 12 Colombian drug
dealers issued by the U.S. Justice Department this week. The four
were indicted last March in Jacksonville.
   Those four, along with Ochoa's brother, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, were
also indicted on drug trafficking charges in 1986 in Miami. All are
at-large.
   About 80 alleged Colombian drug traffickers have been indicted in
the United States, but their cases have languished since the
Colombian Supreme Court overturned its extradition treaty with the
United States in 1987.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco, prompted by last week's
assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan,
instituted emergency measures to allow the immediate resumption of
extraditions.
   The extradition treaty was overturned shortly after the
extradition of former cartel leader Lehder in 1987. He was tried in
Jacksonville, convicted of operating a continuing criminal
enterprise, and is now in federal prison serving a life sentence
without parole.
   Cartel leaders Thursday declared war on the Colombian government
just as bombs blew up offices of two principal political parties in
the Colombian city of Medellin, which serves as a base for the
world's biggest cocaine cartel.
   At the time of the March indictment, U.S. Attorney Robert W.
Genzman, said that Escobar was responsible for the April 1983
assassination of Colombian Justice Minister Lara Bonilla.
   After the killing, according to the indictment, cartel members
including Escobar, Lehder, Rodriquez and Fabio and Jorge Ochoa fled
to Nicaragua.
   In Nicaragua, the cartel brought in 1,400 kilograms of cocaine to
the Los Brasiles Air Force Base. Most of the cocaine was flown into
the United States.
   One of the flights resulted in the seizure of 665 kilograms of
cocaine by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. A second
cocaine flight was made by Lehder's pilots from Nicaragua over Cuba,
to Andros Island in the Bahamas and eventually into United States.
   If convicted of the Jacksonville indictment, which lists 205
separate acts beginning in 1974 and continuing until this year, the
Ochoas, Escobar, and Rodriquez would face mandatory life prison
terms. Prosecutors said the indictment involves the importation of
44,000 pounds of cocaine worth $1 billion. In all, 30 people were
named in the indictment.
   Lehder was convicted of creating a small, private air force and
then using the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay as a way station for
shipments for more than 20 tons of cocaine into the United States
for the Medellin cartel.
   The Miami indictment, which alleges smuggling activities of the
Medellin cartel from 1978 to 1986, claims the practices used by the
cartel included ``the corruption of the public officials of foreign
govenments, the use of force, violence, threats, physical assaults
and murders of informants, discordant employees, and cartel
opponents.''
