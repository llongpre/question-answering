   American Airlines said today it will expand service
to Miami and the Caribbean by 24 flights a day by June 1, filling
gaps left by strike-crippled Eastern Airlines.
   American had said late last year it would expand in Florida, but
the strike pushed its planning schedule ahead.
   ``Obviously the opportunity that Eastern's problem presented
brought us to take a look at the timing of that plan,'' said Robert
Baker, American's senior vice president for operations. ``It was
probably a year down the road. The Caribbean part was closer than
that.''
   American will add 600 employees in Miami. The airline's expanded
presence will represent another $100 million a year to the local
economy.
   The growth in Florida and the Caribbean will add 3,219 seats a
day to the market. New routes from Miami will include nonstop
flights to Los Angeles, New York and Boston.
   New service to the Caribbean will include stops in San Juan,
Puerto Rico and Kingston and Montego Bay in Jamaica, Santo Domingo
and Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic as well as
Port-Au-Prince, Haiti.
   The Caribbean additions will link 14 cities served by American
with the Caribbean hub in San Juan.
   In Miami, American is expanding its daily service from 20 to 31
flights a day. In San Juan, the number of daily flights will rise
from 45 to 52.
   Eastern service represented about a quarter of the seats from
the United States to Jamaica and about a third of the seats to the
U.S. Virgin Islands before the strike.
   ``None of what we have announced today will rise and fall on
what happens to Eastern Airlines or anyone else,'' Baker said.
``Eastern's been in a lot of (the cities). They've been a big guy
here.''
   ``The likelihood is that Eastern will still be the largest
carrier'' in the region, he added.
   American is upgrading its fleet, switching to larger aircraft on
12 flights to the Caribbean to increase its capacity. Direct
service from other U.S. cities to the Caribbean is part of the
airline's plan.
