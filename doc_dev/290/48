   Rising out of the azure waters like the
Caribbean god of wind, Hurricane Gilbert smashed idyllic resorts
and industrial cities during an eight-day rampage across the
Caribbean and Mexico.
   Gilbert grew into a hurricane with winds of 74 mph on Sept. 10,
100 miles southwest of Puerto Rico, sending the first waves of
torrential rain and panic to impoverished towns in Haiti and the
Dominican Republic.
   By the time Gilbert lost its hurricane status over northeastern
Mexico, it had killed more than 300 people, left hundreds of
thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the
Caribbean, Central America, Mexico and the United States.
   Gilbert's trail of destruction across nine nations occurred
despite the technological advances of modern-day weather
forecasting. Airplanes flew into the eye of the hurricane several
times daily and meteorologists with computers predicted the storm's
next target.
   ``It was one of the top 10 as far as intensity, size and
destructive potential,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   After leaving more than eight dead in the Dominican Republic,
Gilbert punished Jamaica's capital Kingston and the resort of
Montego Bay, then pushed northwestward past the Cayman Islands and
Cuba.
   Jamaica, which needs tourism for much of its hard currency,
sustained $8 billion in damage and at least 30 people died.
Kingston lost much of its drinking water, electricity and many
services. A half-million people, nearly one-fourth the island
population, were left homeless.
   Luckiest perhaps was the low-lying three-island British colony
called the Caymans, which suffered remarkably little damage.
   ``All 23,000 people of the islands got on their knees and said
`Thank You,''' journalist Carol Winker said.
   Gilbert moved into the Yucatan Channel between Cuba and Mexico,
gathering strength over warm waters to become a Category 5 storm or
``great hurricane'' with winds of up to 160 mph.
   The Caribbean Indians called their god of wind Huracan, and the
winds of Gilbert were terrifyingly strong, up to 218 mph at one
point as it neared Mexico.
   Rain spread more than 400 miles from north to south. Gilbert's
tail dumped up to 10 inches of rain in portions of Central America,
leaving more than 15 dead in Honduras.
   Next struck was Cancun, a 110-hotel Mexican island resort off
the Yucatan that was built in the 1970s after computer studies
showed it would be rarely hit by hurricanes.
   Said tourist Wendy Kidd of Montreal: ``The wind came in the
bedroom one way and went out the other and took everything with
it.''
   In one Cancun hotel, where 450 were packed into a banquet room,
refugees had to hold up a wall against the strong winds. There was
no water. Toilets, in some cases one to a shelter, could not be
flushed.
   ``We do not know what it is to be dirty ... sharing bathrooms
that don't work. We are not used to it,'' Mrs. Kidd said of the
American and Canadian tourists caught by the storm. ``Some people
handle it graciously and some don't.''
   Gilbert uprooted palms, Indian laurels and other trees and
snapped antenna support cables in the nearby resorts of Cozumel and
Isla Mujeres. Electrical poles fell, breaking power lines. Thatched
huts and wooden structures collapsed.
   After the storm, a 118-foot Cuban fishing boat was found tossed
up beside a beach hotel, dramatic proof of Gilbert's strength.
   Gilbert caused more than $300 million in damage to the tourist
industry of Cancun and Cozumel. In nearby Merida, it destroyed
nearly all the corn and fruit crops. At least 24 died in the area.
   Gilbert next moved into the Gulf of Mexico, threatening oil
drilling installations and populated areas from Veracruz to
Florida, before moving over land in the state of Tamaulipas, 100
miles south of Brownsville, Texas.
   Ocean waters more than three feet deep pushed several miles
inland over the barren flats. At least 11 villagers drowned along
the coast.
   But the worst lay ahead. About 160 miles northwest was Monterrey
and its 2.8 million people.
   Gilbert collided with the 14,000-foot-high mountains around
Monterrey, creating killing torrents with a load of rain that swept
away passenger buses traveling along the normally dry bed of the
Santa Catarina River.
   More than 200 died Sept. 17 in Monterrey alone, the biggest
single toll from the storm.
   In recent years the state government had used the riverbed as a
thoroughfare, for electricity towers and for miles of fields for
baseball and soccer.
   ``The water was kind of running through,'' said witness Cosme
Garibay. ``Then all of a sudden, it came, bam, all at once. I have
never seen anything like it in my life.''
   Two Americans also died from Gilbert-spawned tornadoes in Texas,
but the dying rains did some good, filling dams near the Texas
border and bringing an abrupt end to a long summer drought.
