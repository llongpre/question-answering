IN AN unpretentious factory building on the outskirts of the famed resort
town of Montego Bay on Jamaica's north coast, the only discernable sounds
are those of computer keyboards and the hum of air conditioners. Several
people sit before rows of computer screens, entering data.
It is neither an office nor a factory. In fact, the office is thousands of
miles away, in New York, Toronto, London. This is the cutting edge of
offshore information processing, a new industry in the Caribbean and one
which countries in the region are exploiting as companies try to make the
technological leap away from paper.
'There are 328bn paper pages in offices in the US and people are looking for
better ways of handling these,' says Mr Taher Behbehani, director of US
operations for the Information Technology Exchange Group. 'Conversion is
costly because this involves substantial data processing. Offshore
operations can reduce the cost of this.'
Converting such data is only one part of the information processing market
which Caribbean countries are seeking. The Dominican Republic, Barbados and
St Lucia, in addition to Jamaica, are becoming centres for the offshore
information processing industry.
The services include processing airline tickets, insurance claims, mailing
lists, coupons for credit card companies, banks and other financial
institutions, hospital patient lists and electronic publishing, hotel and
airline reservations and credit card authorisation. There is continuing and
growing demand for other services such as custom-built software programming,
voice applications, video conferencing, mapping and geological services and
computer-aided designing for architects.
In just one example, a subsidiary of American Airlines ships tickets to
Barbados and the Dominican Republic where they are processed in computers
and the information sent by satellite back to the US.
High speed data transmission facilities - teleports - are being constructed
in Jamaica, Barbados, St Lucia and the Dominican Republic. This allows the
Caribbean to get a slice of the growing telemarketing or phone-based mail
ordering industry. A call made in the US on an 800 toll-free line could be
answered in one of these Caribbean states and the transaction completed in
the US in a few minutes.
The Jamaican teleport, located in Montego Bay, is a Dollars 8.5m (Pounds
4.9m) joint venture by American Telephone and Telegraph of the US, Cable and
Wireless of the UK and Telecommunications of Jamaica. The teleport offers
facilities for voice, facsimile and data transmission, toll-free services
and voice-and-video tele-conferencing.
'We tell our prospective clients that if they can move it from the ground
floor to the fifth floor, then they can move it from the ground floor to
Jamaica for much less,' says Mr Winston Gooden, acting vice-president of
Jamaica Promotions, the island's industrial development agency.
The Caribbean faces competition from the Philippines, Ireland and Singapore,
but feels it can get more than a small share of the fast-growing information
processing market, in which Mr Lawson Nurse, a director of the Barbados
Industrial Development Corporation, says US companies spend about Dollars
50bn per year.
'The information processing industry began here 25 years ago and has grown
steadily,' says Mr Carl Clarke, Barbados' trade, industry and commerce
minister. 'During the early period of the industry's development, the type
of work done was basic and low-skilled. However, in recent years, there has
been a definite shift to the higher value-added type of processing
activities.'
The Caribbean countries have been able to increase their share of the
information processing market through lower wage rates, which are about a
third of that paid for similar work in the US. Recent improvements in the
region's telecommunications infrastructure have also helped. In addition to
the teleports, companies such as Cable and Wireless have been upgrading
several national telecommunications systems.
Mr Gooden says the turnover of workers in the information processing
industry in the US is about 35 per cent, while in the Caribbean a staff
turnover of 5 per cent would be considered high. The accuracy level of
workers in the Caribbean operations is significantly higher than that of
those in the US, he claimed.
The Caribbean countries also benefit from the pollution-free nature of the
industry, which is environmentally compatible with their tourism.
