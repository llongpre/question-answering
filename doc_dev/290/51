<HEAD>Witness Says His Group Handled Millions in Drug Money Monthly</HEAD>

   A government witness testified that an
organization he formed with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega and
others laundered $50 million to $100 million in drug money monthly
for the Medellin drug cartel.
   Stephen Kalish, imprisoned as a repeat offender in drug
enterprises, is testifying for the government in U.S. District
Court against 23 men accused of smuggling marijuana and cocaine
into the United States.
   In Thursday's testimony, Kalish said the group he set up with
Noriega received a 5 percent commission for laundering drug money
for the Ochoa family of Colombia. Law enforcement officials
describe the Ochoas as co-leaders of the Medellin drug cartel.
   Kalish, who has claimed a close relationship with Noriega, said
he once purchased a $2 million helicopter for the Panamanian
dictator.
   When arrested in 1984, Kalish said, he sent a letter to Noriega
promising to keep the operation secret.
   ``I told him I wouldn't disclose his activities to the U.S.
government, and I was sorry I didn't tell him I was a federal
fugitive,'' he said.
   The United States has been using political and economic pressure
in an effort to oust Noriega since he was indicted on drug
trafficking charges in February 1988 by federal grand juries in
Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   Kalish said under his 1987 plea bargain with federal prosecutors
in Florida, he agreed to forfeit $2.8 million in assets but the
government can seize any other assets it can find.
   Judge John Shaw ruled Wednesday that defense attorneys may ask
Kalish about any smuggling profits he kept but cannot ask where he
hid the money.
   Kalish, who pleaded guilty to operating a continuing criminal
enterprise, is serving a 10-year prison term, reduced because of
his testimony at previous trials and before the Senate.
