   There's an international flavor to Mackinac
Island during the tourist season. Jamaican waiters, Austrian cooks
and Mexican maids are imported each year to fill jobs some hotel
operators say Americans don't want. It's all perfectly legal under
the U.S. Labor Department's temporary certification program for
aliens.

   Here on this resort island in the
Great Lakes, Jamaican waiters and Austrian cooks square off in a
soccer match.
   Jamaican Independence Day is celebrated on Mackinac Island with
a dinner party thrown by the waiters. Islanders still talk about
the time a tureen of goat's head soup from the party wound up the
next day on the serving table of one of the smaller hotels.
   Down on the wharf on a recent weekend, the sugary smell of fudge
mingled with that of horses and cyclists and tourists all
perspiring under an unseasonably hot sun.
   Above it all at the cliffside Grand Hotel, LeRoy Champagnie
smoothly waited tables by the golf course. Not a drop of sweat
beaded his brow nor stained his white coat.
   He doesn't mind the heat. In fact, he's quite happy. ``I like
the work,'' he says in a thick Jamaican accent.
   Champagnie is among 32,000 foreign workers brought to the United
States this year under the U.S. Labor Department's temporary
certification program to take jobs some employers claim Americans
either can't or won't fill.
   These legal aliens cut Florida sugar cane, pick Maryland apples
and, in Michigan, they wait upon the mostly white, rich tourists at
the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island.
   Federal overseers acknowledge the program is a target for legal
suits from any number of contestants _ including displaced
Americans and advocates for foreign laborers.
   ``Court cases go hand-in-hand with this program,'' said one
administrator, Tom Bruening in Washington, D.C.
   This year, for instance, apple growers in Maryland, Virginia and
West Virginia were ordered to pay more than $2 million in back
wages to 10,000 underpaid Jamaican field hands.
   Yet employers such as the Grand Hotel swear by the program.
   Service at the impeccable Grand was getting, well, sloppy,
before the Jamaicans arrived, says owner Dan Musser.
   Ten years ago, the hotel was hiring American college students
who cared little about what to do with the wine cork. ``I think our
service showed it, dramatically,'' Musser says.
   Even that kind of help was hard to find. Eight people answered
the hotel's advertisement in a Detroit newspaper offering $3.35 an
hour minimum to waiters, waitresses and chambermaids.
   Five of the American applicants were hired. Only two showed up
for work, Musser says.
   ``Every year we try to recruit, but it is very difficult,'' he
says.
   Meanwhile, in Jamaica, the Grand's headwaiter, Kenneth Salmon,
sifted through thousands of applications for the same jobs. The 123
Jamaican waiters, Austrian cooks and Mexican maids the Grand Hotel
hired not only wanted the seasonal jobs, they are professionals who
work the high-class resorts of their home countries the six months
of the year they are not on Mackinac Island.
   American waiters are not that hard to find, says Floyd Borowski,
head of human resources for Mackinac Island's other large resort,
Mission Point. But Mission Point does not recruit in Detroit. The
hotel hires seasoned waiters from resorts in western Florida and
Arizona. ``The supply is there,'' Borowski says.
   After seven years of using foreign labor, the Grand's waiters
now are almost entirely Jamaican.
   Musser refuses to say how much his foreign waiters earn _ ``We
like not to spread that around.'' _ or how much of their wages are
deposited directly in Jamaican banks, a requirement imposed by the
British West Indies Central Labour Organization.
   Federal law requires that foreign laborers earn as much as their
American counterparts. And according to figures from the Michigan
Employment Security Commission, the Grand's waiters earn $3.35 an
hour, above the standard $2.52, but the hotel's no-tipping policy
eliminates the standard gratuity. Instead, the Grand waiters are
paid $2.20 for each $40 dinner they serve.
   Champagnie expects to earn about $8,000 for his six months at
the Grand Hotel, comparable to what he earns during the winter at a
resort in Jamaica, where his wife and children stay. Someday
Champagnie hopes to save enough money to stop waiting tables and
open a real estate company.
   ``I took this for traveling experience, to better myself in
life,'' says waiter George Gaubault, 27, from Montego Bay, Jamaica.
``It's a future here, so I really work hard.''
   The Grand's Jamaicans live as cheaply as they can on an island
built for vacationers.
   Workers can buy their meals at a hotel cafeteria and the Grand
charges its employees about $125 a month to live in dormitories
behind the hotel, Musser says.
   ``Rice, kidney beans and soup meat ...,'' butcher Pat Granning
ticked off the usual shopping list for Jamaicans at Doud's
Mercantile, the only grocery on Mackinac Island. `And chicken. They
buy a lot of chicken.''
   Now the bellboys of summer are going home. The college kids who
put on aprons and waiters' jackets are back in school.
   The Grand's Jamaicans leave this month to return to their native
jobs before the tourist season in the Caribbean gets into full
swing.
