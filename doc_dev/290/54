   An earthquake shook Jamaica shortly
before noon Monday, rocking buildings in Kingston and sending
frightened residents fleeing into the street.
   There were no reports of deaths and police said only one injury
was reported.
   They said Natalie Thompson, 14, suffered broken ankles when she
jumped in panic from the second floor of the Rosemount School in
Linstead, St. Catherine, 40 miles northwest of the capital of
Kingston.
   Officials said they had no reports of significant structural
damage but the Office of Disaster Preparedness is conducting an
island-wide survey of bridges and buildings.
   The Seismic Research Unit at the University of the West Indies
recorded the quake at 11:24 a.m. (EDT) and said its center was in
the Caribbean Sea about 75 miles northeast of Montego Bay and 15
miles south of the Cuban communities of Pilon and Portillo.
   It said the earthquake measured 4.2 degrees on the Richter scale.
   The university said the worst earthquake recorded in Jamaica was
on Jan. 14, 1907, when Kingston was virtually destroyed. More than
1,000 people were killed and 9,000 were left homeless.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by a quake as
recored on seismographs. A tremor registering 4 is capable of
causing moderate damage and one with a magnitude of 5 can cause
considerable damage. A quake recorded at 7 is considered a major
quake.
