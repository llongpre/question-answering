<LEADPARA>  Three of Colombia's most notorious cocaine dealers, Jorge Luis Ochoa and his
brothers, Fabio and Juan David, who had surrendered to Colombian authorities
under an intricate plea-bargaining plan, are likely to be freed this summer as
a result of competing concerns between Colombian and U.S. justice officials,
according to well-placed sources in Miami and Colombia.;    Colombian
officials say that without help from the United States, they would be unable
to make a serious criminal case against the Ochoas. U.S. officials fear that
the debilitated Colombian justice system would not be able to make effective
use of evidence in U.S. hands that they hope to be able to use eventually
against the drug bosses in American courtrooms.  </LEADPARA>
