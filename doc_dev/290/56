<HEAD>Cable From Jamaica: `Emergency Conditions. Total Devastation'</HEAD>

   Television commercials still were inviting
viewers to ``come back to Jamaica'' on Tuesday when a Madison
Avenue advertising executive managed to get a telex from Kingston
to his home office.
   ``Emergency conditions. Total devastation. ... Cancel all TV and
print advertising. Appeal as a national disaster.''
   Account supervisor Edward Daley's dramatic cable to Young &amp;
Rubicam Inc. was one of the first attempts by the tourism industry
to deal with the devastation wrought by Hurricane Gilbert, the
century's strongest storm.
   There were few attempts at boosterism Thursday as tourism
officials attempted to assess the damage and help stranded tourists
get home.
   Travel agents, tour operators and airline spokesmen said they
were offering rebookings or refunds to anyone who had booked trips
for this week or this weekend. For trips farther into the future,
policies varied.
   A surprising number of tourists did not want to reschedule.
   ``It's amazing. People think the storm just came and went and
not much really happened,'' said Sisi Gulmez, president of
Magnatours Inc., which specializes in Mexico's Cancun. ``Our future
bookings may have slowed down but they have not stopped by any
means.''
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., travel agency employee Bradley Jones
said he was holding his reservations for Cancun this Tuesday, at
least for now.
   ``I'm thinking of just landing and see what it's like,'' Jones
said. ``I was thinking of doing some camping anyway.''
   Despite the proliferation of television and newspaper reports
from Jamaica, tourism officials said the island remained largely
cut off from the outside world.
   ``We have been answering questions, but it's very perplexing for
us _ the frustration because we don't know what's going on,'' said
Louise Munsch, director of operations and reservations for Sunburst
Holidays, one of the major bookers of trips to Jamaica.
   Sunburst was offering refunds to anyone who had bookings for the
next 10 days. Munsch said most customers with later bookings seemed
to be waiting for more information before deciding whether to
cancel.
   Still, she said, ``I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't
concerned.''
   Most of the damage so far was in Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and
Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, raising the possibility that other
Caribbean resorts could benefit from the spillover.
   On Thursday, for example, two cruise ships docked unexpectedly
in Puerto Rico's San Juan harbor. But Lauren Yankus, a spokeswoman
for Puerto Rico Tourist Co., said the organization did not want to
seem to encourage such detours for fear of seeming to take
advantage of others' misery.
   One consolation was that tourism is relatively light in
September, largely because people don't like to visit the islands
during hurricane season, said Jack Bloch, owner of JB's World
Travel Consultants in New York.
   Commercial flights out of Jamaica resumed Thursday on a limited
basis. Only daytime flights were possible because electricity was
not fully restored at either airport, said Dinaz Boga, a
spokeswoman for Air Jamaica in New York.
   There were plans for about seven flights today, she said.
   In Mexico, Mexicana Airlines spokeswoman Ruth Shari reported
late Thursday she had received word there was no major damage to
hotels.
   Club Med Inc. had planes standing by waiting to carry home
guests from its Cancun resort as soon as airports reopened, said
Jean-Luc Oizan-Chapon, the chief operating officer.
   Ms. Shari said there was a chance the airport in Merida, about
four hours by car from Cancun, could open by today.
   Hurricane Gilbert did not seem to upset Continental Airlines,
which chose Wednesday to announce its first expansion into the
Caribbean, including daily flights to Jamaica. The service begins
Dec. 16.
   One man still stranded in Jamaica on Thursday was Daley, the ad
man. The roof blew off Daley's hotel Monday night and the phones
were dead, but associates at Young &amp; Rubicam said he managed to
find a Japanese employee of the Mitsui &amp; Co. trading company who
cabled his message here Tuesday.
   After taking care of business, Daley wrote, ``Tell family father
is OK. Home this weekend (hope).''
