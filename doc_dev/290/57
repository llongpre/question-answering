   Word from home was the most sought-after commodity
among groups collecting relief supplies for Caribbean islands
ravaged by one of the strongest hurricanes on record.
   Food, clothing and medical supplies for Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands were collected Tuesday in about a dozen locations across
southern Florida as Hurricane Gilbert and its 175 mph winds blew
toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
   ``The tension level is quite high. People want to hear from
their loved ones,'' said Ingrid Price, a Jamaican helping organize
relief efforts in Fort Lauderdale.
   Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga said late Tuesday at least
six people were killed and an estimated 60,000 were left homeless
in ``the worst natural disaster in the modern history of Jamaica.''
   Ms. Price said a team of about 30 doctors and health-care
workers were ready to head to Jamaica once clearance was given from
officials in Kingston, where workers tried to reopen the capital's
two airports and restore electrical and phone service.
   She added that at least $20,000 has been collected by the center
and several radio stations serving south Florida's estimated
150,000 Jamaicans.
   ``We will be willing to supply them with whatever they need,''
said Dr. Winston Alexis, who is heading the medical team.
   ``Everyone just wants to know about their families back in
Jamaica,'' said relief organizer Monica Mooah. ``There are many
very anxious people.''
   Three Air Jamaica planes full of supplies were ready to fly from
Miami International Airport to Jamaica once an airport there was
confirmed to be safe, said Rupert Williams, commander of the St.
John Ambulance Brigade of Jamaica's Army Medical Corps.
   The relief effort was being coordinated by the Jamaican
Consulate and Metro-Dade County, Kingston's ``sister city,'' he
said.
   On Tuesday, an Air Force C-130 plane with international and U.S.
officials aboard arrived in Jamaica to set up a satellite
communication system.
   Clint O'Neil, popular late-night reggae music disc-jockey on
WLRN in Miami, said many listeners have called seeking information
on relatives.
   ``I don't have much to tell them,'' he said. ``The
communications are still down. Nobody really knows how bad things
are.''
   The hurricane ``just souped up over the entirety of Jamaica.
There's no place on the island that escaped,'' said Percival R.
Todd, Jamaica's deputy consul-general in Miami.
   Charlie, the last major hurricane to strike the island directly,
killed 111 people in 1951, said Todd.
   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony, flood waters began to
recede Tuesday and phone service was restored to some sections,
said Gretchen Allen, former press secretary for the Cayman
government.
   ``There did not seem to be casualties and the island seem to
have took it very well,'' said Allen.
   On Tuesday, the Cayman government collected canned goods,
medical supplies and food at a special center set up near Miami
International Airport.
