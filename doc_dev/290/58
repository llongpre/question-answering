   When Hurricane Gilbert slammed into the
Yucatan Peninsula last week it dealt a crippling blow to Mexico's
vital tourist industry, which depends on the peninsula for
one-fourth of its revenue.
   Antonio Erales, tourism director for the Caribbean resort of
Cancun, estimated storm damage there alone at $429 million.
   He said tourism at Cancun, on this resort island and on the
island of Isla Mujeres will be suspended for up to three months for
repairs.
   ``Cancun will be back to normal possibly in December,'' Erales
said.
   About 90 percent of Cancun's beachfront hotels and all seaside
establishments in Cozumel and Isla Mujeres were damaged by the
storm, which claimed at least 31 lives in the Yucatan.
   In Jamaica, officials said Montego Bay and other big resorts on
the northern coast escaped the worst of the storm.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica estimated that Gilbert
caused $8 billion worth of damage when it struck on Monday. But of
the island's nearly $600 million-a-year tourism industry, he said:
``I'm glad to say it's in reasonably good shape.''
   Yet most major hotels in Montego Bay bore plain signs of
Gilbert's ferocity _ gaping holes in roofs and ceilings, shattered
windows, standing water, mangled balcony railings.
   Four of Montego Bay's five biggest hotels were shut down because
of damage and the fifth, the Wyndham Rose Hall Beach Hotel and
Country Club, faced costly repairs. Only two of the 15 big
restaurants in the resort area managed to open.
   The extent of the destruction was such that it was difficult to
imagine the famous resort recovering anytime soon, barring a
massive rebuilding program.
   In the Yucatan, officials said they had advised international
tourist agents of the problems in the area, which attracts most of
its visitors from the United States and Europe.
   The stay-aways are sure to hurt tourism, which vies with
Mexico's maquiladora, or in-bond assembly industry, as the
country's second-leading generator of foreign exchange after oil.
   Officials and residents in the Yucatan worry about the impact
Gilbert's destruction will have on the local economy.
   ``About 50,000 people live here and all of us earn our living
from tourism. If the authorities don't solve this problem soon
there will be 50,000 unemployed,'' lamented Lazaro Torre, a
22-year-old lobsterman from Cozumel. About 6,000 tourists visit the
island each week.
   ``What are we going to do?,'' asked Jose Luis Viniegas, an owner
of a small fishing boat company on Cozumel. He said most of his
boats were destroyed in the storm.
   Both Cozumel and Cancun still lacked drinking water, electricity
and telephone service on Sunday. Medical authorities expressed
concern about sanitary conditions.
   Tourists caught in Gilbert's path waited for days to get a
flight home or salvage their vacations with a trip elsewhere. Air
traffic was limited to daylight hours because Gilbert knocked out
runway lights and nighttime radar.
   Miguel Mairu of Venezuela was among 3,500 visibly exhausted
tourists waiting at Cancun Airport Saturday for a seat on one of 13
commerical flights out of the city.
   ``Gilbert dashed all our plans to spend unforgettable days,''
said Mairu, in Cancun for his honeymoon. ``The hotel where we were
staying was destroyed and I spent my wedding night next to my
beautiful wife _ but also with another 600 people who also slept in
the ballroom of another hotel.''
   Some vacationers complained they received little or no warning
that the most powerful storm on record was about to hit.
   ``We got to Cancun on the last flight on Tuesday,'' said Joan
McCarrick, 31, of Hillsdale, N.J. ``We didn't even know anything
about it. We got to our hotel, put our things in our room and went
downstairs to have dinner.
   ``That's when they told us we had to evacuate,'' she said.
