   Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley
was flown to Miami early Monday for treatment of pneumonia, the
Jamaican government said.
   Manley, 65, was flown by air ambulance from the Jamaican capital
of Kingston at 3 a.m. and was taken to the Miami Heart Institute
where a diagnosis of ``atypical pneumonia'' was made, according to
a statement from the Jamaica House in Kingston.
   Last month, it was announced that Manley has cancer.
   ``He has been undergoing tests and we're waiting now for the
results of those tests,'' said Hartley Neita, an aide with Manley
in Miami Beach. ``From there on, the doctors will go full blast on
treatment.''
   He said no one could speculate on how long Manley would be
hospitalized.
   Neita said Manley watched a little of the French Open tennis
tournament on television, but spent most of the day resting.
   ``We're not pressing him at all. The purpose is to rest and
recover as soon as possible,'' Neita said.
   The Jamaica House statement quoted a message by President Bush
sent through the U.S. Embassy in Kingston in which the president
expressed concern for the prime minister's health.
   It said Bush offered to send a military aircraft to Kingston but
Manley was transported by a private air ambulance.
   Manley is a socialist who has moderated his positions since
losing 1980 elections after eight years as prime minister. He led
his People's National Party back back into power in February 1989
after winning 1988 elections.
   Manley was admitted to University Hospital in Kingston on Sunday
where the pneumonia was first diagnosed.
   The prime minister was to undergo prostate surgery June 5 at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The cancerous
growth was discovered last month during a routine medical
examination. At the time, the Jamaican government said his chances
for recovery were excellent.
