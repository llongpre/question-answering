   A threat to ban a fourth singer slated to perform in
this weekend's Calle Ocho festival drew protests Friday from city
officials and Latin groups who say the organizers' anti-Castro
policy has gone too far.
   City Manager Cesar Odio froze a $15,000 city subsidy to the
Little Havana Kiwanis Club, which sponsors the event, on grounds the
group may have violated its contract barring political or religious
activities in the festival.
   Dade County authorities also held up another $15,000 payment
aimed at helping to market the gigantic street party, slated to be
held Sunday.
   ``Calle Ocho is a Mardi Gras of all cultures of Spanish-speaking
background,'' said Yvette Morgan of the National Conference of
Puerto Rican Women, one of the critics of the ban. ``It has always
been for all Hispanic arts, not just for the anti-communists.''
   About 40 Puerto Rican men and women picketed outside the Kiwanis
Club offices Friday in the Little Havana neighborhood, chanting and
carrying signs saying ``This is the United States'' and ``Pepsi-Cola
is in Russia, why not Montanez in Calle Ocho?'', referring to one of
the banned performers, Puerto Rican singer Andy Montanez.
   Kiwanis leaders insisted again Friday they will not back down
from their strict rule barring anyone who has performed in Cuba
since Fidel Castro's revolution. They said the last-minute freeze of
government subsidies should not seriously affect the festitval.
   ``Our policy has to stay for this year,'' insisted Kiwanis
President Pedro Menendez. ``It's too late to change it.''
   However, he emphasized that the Kiwanis had not deliberately
picked a fight over the issue, and were simply trying not to offend
the city's large anti-communist Cuban community.
   ``This has definitely gone too far,'' Menendez said. ``Our
original intention was not to insult certain segments of our
community, and apparently, by trying to do that, we have insulted
other people.''
   Three Latin singers _ Montanez; Brazilian Denise de Kalafe; and
Spain's De Raymond _ have been banned already this year by the
Kiwanis because they made appearances in Cuba as long as 20 years
ago.
   And on Friday, Menendez said they might also exclude famed
merengue singer Wilfrido Vargas of the Dominican Republic, who is
credited as performing on a record album made in Cuba a decade ago.
Menendez said Kiwanis officials were checking to confirm that he was
really there.
   All the singers have strongly condemned Castro's government.
   The Miami Herald withdrew its sponsorship of Calle Ocho after De
Raymond _ scheduled to sing with the duo Los Espanolisimos on a
newspaper-sponsored stage _ was dropped because of a 1978 appearance
in Cuba.
   De Raymond said the ban was particularly painful for him because
he was barred from Spain's Socialist-run television for six years
because of his strong anti-communist views. ``I deserve a tribute,
not a ban,'' De Raymond said.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez has also condemned the bans.
   ``The position the Kiwanis have taken is really hurting them and
the city,'' Suarez said. ``It is a very extreme position for them to
take _ one I don't think too many people agree with, even in the
Cuban community.''
   Some in the Cuban community support the tough stand, however,
saying the performers had insulted the exiles here, who consider
themselves refugees of an autocratic regime.
   ``I can't see people having festivals in Miami Beach and inviting
people who performed for Hitler,'' said state Rep. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart.
   Calle Ocho _ which means Eighth Street in Spanish, named for the
main thoroughfare of Little Havana where it takes place _ has become
the nation's largest Latin festival in only 10 years. It attracts a
million people as well as top entertainment from around Latin
America.
