The Antilles
The Caribbean islands are made up of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, a
1,700-mile arc of islands running from Florida to the coast of South
America. They vary in size from Cuba (the same size as England) to tiny cays
and sandbars with just a few palm trees. They go by many names: the Antilles
after a mythical medieval continent in the unexplored Atlantic; the West
Indies because Columbus struck west in search of India; and the Caribbean
after the cannibalistic Carib Indians he found there.
Today, the Caribbean offers a superb rest-cure: easy-going island-life and a
warm and welcome relief from the grinding downward spiral of winter
depression. There is dependable sun, sea, sand, rum punch and reggae.
Comfort comes in many forms - private island enclaves, old colonial
refinement, luxury aboard a 100-ft yacht . . .
Anguilla
A slumber-struck retreat with superb beaches, beloved of a well-heeled
British crowd. Quietly chic with some expensive hotels (Cap Juluca, Cove
Castles and Malliouhana, but also some guest houses), and a string of
water-front restaurants.
Antigua
Also favoured by the well-to-do: excellent deserted beaches and some
five-star hotels (Curtain Bluff, Jumby Bay and mock rustic Galley Bay).
Famed for Race Week, out of Nelson's Harbour, at the close of the Caribbean
winter sailing season.
Beaches
The Caribbean has some of the world's finest beaches - blinding white
strands that run deserted to the horizon; talcum-powder sand washed with
gin-clear water; palm-backed posing beaches where the body-beautiful roam;
smuggler's coves.
A pick of the best: Anse la Roche, an isolated cove on Carriacou; Anse de
Grande Saline on St Barts for starlet-spotting; Shoal Bay in Anguilla for
supreme, palm-shaded sand; five miles of Negril Beach in Jamaica for
unflinching hedonism.
Barbados
A grand dame of Caribbean tourism. The west coast, a millionaire's
playground (hotels like Sandy Lane and Cobbler's Cove), has attracted the
smart set for a couple of generations, but it is easy to have a good time on
a less expansive budget.
Bequia
Post-card picturesque, Bequia is the prettiest of the Grenadines. The Port
Elizabeth waterfront is lined with neat wooden villas and small hotels
nestling among the palms.
Carnival
People leave their jobs to get back to Trinidad's Carnival, a five-day
extravaganza of calypso concerts and street parades. Thousands of costumed
masqueraders shuffle-step in choreographed sequence through the streets of
Port of Spain and, unlike Rio and New Orleans - 'just fashion parades,' the
Trinis claim - you can buy a costume and join in. Most other Caribbean
islands have their own carnivals now, and any is worth attending if you are
on-island.
Calypso
Calypsos are the driving beat behind carnival, bounding along to a
drum-driven rhythm. But they are more than simply dance-music; the lyrics
sing of love, sex and politics. And the calypsonians, Lord This and The
Mighty That, are performers as well as singers.
Climate
The Bahamas were once known as the Isles of Perpetual June because Caribbean
weather is so dependably warm. The temperature hovers at about 80`F
year-round. Seasons are dry and wet (June and November).
The best (and most expensive) time to travel is January-April (high season),
when the weather is constant and the tradewinds at their strongest.
Hurricanes are the fiercest natural scourge in an otherwise clement area.
Diving
Scuba-diving in warm tropical waters takes you into a different dimension.
You glide over vast hemispheres of brain coral and barrel sponges big enough
to sit in; shoals of fish dip and dart and crabs eye you quizzically. Famous
dive-sites include: Bonaire slopes for colourful corals; barrier reefs in
the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and the sheer walls of the Cayman
Islands, where you can cavort with sting rays.
Festivals
There are many festivals besides the carnivals: sailing regattas, deep-sea
fishing tournaments, Catholic fetes patronales (Saint's Days, but more like
a week's celebration), even Hindu and Muslim festivities. Others are centred
on music and dance, from imported jazz to home-grown concerts.
French Caribbean
The French Antilles (Martinique, Guadeloupe, St Martin and St Barts) have a
standard of living equal to that of France itself. You may have to put up
with crowds, but these islands have fine classical French restaurants and
bistros.
Getting around
There are plenty of taxis in the Caribbean, but local buses are more fun,
and more like mobile discotheques than transport. Many have names - Street
Demon, Thunder Run - and you will get to know fellow passengers well in the
squash. Hire cars and mini-mokes are readily available, though they vary in
price and regulations across the islands.
Hustlers
Hustling is persistent in some islands (especially Jamaica) and can be
annoying, even frightening. Small-time dealers scour the beaches and towns
and will offer you anything from a rasta wristband to a bag of ganja. A
persistent and polite 'No' is the only way to keep your peace.
Humming-birds
These tiny, shimmering creatures of great beauty have a metabolic rate so
high they must fly and feed all day. Trinidad, which has some of the most
extensive birdlife in the region, has 16 species of hummingbirds alone.
Island hopping
Most of the graceful inter-island schooners are gone now, so island-hopping
is done via coffin-sized aircraft that hum like oversized tuning forks but
can stop on a sixpence. Airstrips (not much larger) can be hair-raising.
Worst of all is Saba in the Dutch Windwards, a 400-yard strip with a 100-ft
drop at either end.
Jamaica
The largest and liveliest of the former British islands. A string of villas
and top-notch hotels can protect you from hustlers, but Jamaica is also an
island to explore for inland bathing in rivers and waterfalls, the
hedonistic pleasures of Negril, and for world-famous reggae bands playing to
small home crowds.
Limbo
Trinidadians must take the credit/responsibility for the limbo, an
impressive athletic feat that is now the scourge of every tropical party.
Dancers perform an inverted high jump, shuffling, sidling and shimmying
under a (sometimes flaming) pole.
Liming
A traditional Caribbean pastime, centred on streetfront rum-shops - a cross
between passing the time of day and street theatre.
Island retreats
There are some supremely luxurious private island retreats in the islands.
In the Grenadines are Petit St Vincent (PSV to its habitues) and Young
Island, once swapped by the governor for his black stallion. In the Virgin
Islands try Peter Island or Richard Branson's Necker Island.
Monte Cristo
It is ironic that the world's finest cigars, so beloved of fat-cat
businessmen, are made in Cuba, the self-appointed adversary of capitalism.
Fidel himself has stopped smoking them, but you will see Cuban builders
puffing on Size 4 Monte Cristos while mixing the cement.
Mustique
An absurdly luxurious, little-island enclave in the Grenadines, peopled by
notables as varied as Princess Margaret and David Bowie.
Netherlands Antilles
The Dutch Caribbean is split into two groups separated by 600 miles of the
Caribbean Sea - the Dutch Windwards (Saba, St Eustatius and over-developed
Sint Maarten) and the Dutch Leewards (Bonaire, Curacao and Aruba), with
colourful facades and curly gables like a tropical Amsterdam. The language,
Papiamento, is an unholy mix of Portuguese, African, English, Spanish and
Dutch.
No problem]
The popular T-shirt slogan and habitual call of West Indians when they are
being so laid back it becomes annoying. If you complain about your meal
taking too long, they will reply coolly 'No Problem', and carry on
regardless.
Oloffson Hotel
A magnificent gingerbread mansion in Port au Prince (Haiti's capital), used
by Graham Greene as the setting for his novel, The Comedians. The man who
inspired the character Petit Pierre still breakfasts each morning on the
veranda.
Plantation houses
While most Caribbean hotels are furnished in white wicker with bright and
breezy pastel fittings, there is the odd hangover from the plantation days.
The tiny, twin-island country of St Kitts and Nevis has half-a-dozen
excellent plantation hotels.
Rhythm
Music is played everywhere in the Caribbean, usually at high volume and all
day long (except when the cricket commentary is on). There is practically a
different beat for each island. The best known is reggae from Jamaica (now
grafted with rap to become dancehall); Trinidad reverberates to soca (from
soul-calypso), and Martinique to the racing double beat of zouk. The Latin
islands have their rhythms, too: the Dominican Republic bustles to meringue
and Cuba and Puerto Rico have their own versions of salsa.
Rum punch
Rum is the Caribbean's drink. The rhyme for rum punch goes: One of sour
(lime-juice), Two of sweet (cane-juice or sugar), Three of strong (rum),
Four of weak (water). Nutmeg is often sprinkled on top (Blackbeard would
drink his rum with a tincture of gunpowder). The locals usually drink white
overproof rums and it is well worth joining them.
Shades and swimsuits
These are the essential wardrobe of the Caribbean traveller, though there
are still one or two places where you can air the tuxedo: the smarter hotels
in Barbados still retain a dress code and many places request a jacket.
Generally, a shirt and trousers or a skirt are enough in the evenings.
Santo Domingo
The oldest city in the New World, capital of the Dominican Republic.
Tradewinds
The Tradewinds are the refreshing equatorial breezes that blow through the
islands, taking the edge off the heat.
Operators
Some of the best-known UK specialists include: Caribbean Connection (tel:
0244-341131), Elegant Resorts (0244-329671) and Caribtours (071-581-3517).
Volcanoes
Here are a couple of predictions for Caribbean volcanic activity in the
1990s: the appearance of one island (probably Kick 'Em Jenny in the
Grenadines, which has been growing steadily over the decades), and the
disappearance of another.
Virgin Islands
A scattering of 100-odd islands and cays, divided between the US and UK. St
Thomas in the USVI is over-developed (into a superannuated shopping
precinct), but eastward is a string of smaller islands with isolated coves
and superb beach bars.
Watersports
From pedalos to parascenders, the Caribbean has them all. Join the rude-boys
on a jet-ski for the afternoon, or tame the winds on a sail-board.
X-rated dancing
Caribbean dancing is all lower-carriage movement, a mesmeric swaying and
pumping of hips and thighs. Typically forthright, Trinidadian dancers lock
themselves together from midriff to mid-thigh as they 'wine and grine' (back
to back, front on back, or just plain groin on groin). In the Latin islands
they waltz with a graceful bustle, sensuality created by thighs that barely
touch.
Yankee dollar
An old calypso sings of working for the Yankee dollar, which is still in
universal demand. Most islands have their own currency, but hotel and often
restaurant prices are set in US dollars. Credit cards are accepted
everywhere on the tourist circuit. Generally, the Caribbean is not cheap
(unless you go native) and you can expect to pay similar prices to home when
eating out.
Yachting
The two main yachting areas are the Virgin Islands, safe and relatively easy
sailing along the Sir Francis Drake Passage, with short hops between beach
bars; and the Grenadines, which have a wilder beauty and less developed
islands. Both have isolated, sandy coves and cays to which you can retreat.
Gin palaces are readily available with direct airport transfer to on-board
heli-pads.
Zombies
The name of the living dead in Haitian voodoo. They are not known to haunt
beach bars and hotels.
An updated edition of James Henderson's Cadogan Guide to the Caribbean, with
revised sections on restaurants, hotels, bars and beach bars, was published
on October 1 (Pounds 12.95).
