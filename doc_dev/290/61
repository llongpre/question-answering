   Hotels are going up so
fast at Playa Dorada resort that golf vistas include half-built
buildings as well as palm trees, and sunbathers have to walk past
construction workers and cement mixers to get to the beach.
   Fresh water and electricity are in short supply, and the
romantic candles guests find in their rooms really are there to
tide them through blackouts.
   But never mind. Tourists drawn by white sand beaches, warm
winter breezes and bargain prices are flocking to this
Spanish-speaking nation and making it the most popular Caribbean
destination after Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.
   Tourism Minister Fernando Rainieri says, ``I hope to make the
Dominican Republic the tourism Mecca of the Caribbean before 1990.''
   Just a few years ago, such an expectation would have seemed
hopelessly optimistic. In 1979, there were only 3,400 hotel rooms
in the whole country, direct flights were few and marketing efforts
haphazard.
   Today, resorts like Puerta Plata and La Romana are as well known
as Cancun, Mexico, and Montego Bay, Jamaica.
   Visitor arrivals jumped 21 percent to 791,380 last year, and are
up 60 percent this decade. Hotel capacity has soared to 12,000
rooms and is expected to reach 23,000 in time for the 1991 winter
season.
   The boom is the result of increased promotional efforts, a
favorable exchange rate _ the U.S. dollar that bought 1 peso four
years ago now buys more than 5 _ and generous financial incentives
for investors.
   Airlines increased seats by 50 percent in 1987, Rainieri said,
and plan to do the same this year.
   The industry is the brightest spot in an economy where one of
every two workers is jobless or only marginally employed, and one
in four lives below the poverty line.
   Tourism has created 40,000 direct and 100,000 indirect jobs,
many paying several times the minimum wage of $70 a month.
   Most new construction is taking place on the north coast, a
sun-drenched strip of beaches wedged between a mountain ridge and
the Atlantic Ocean that seems a world removed from the crowded,
impoverished capital Santo Domingo, located on the Caribbean coast
four hours away by car.
   The Playa Dorada resort, built on a sugar cane field, has eight
hotels with 150 to 400 rooms each. Four more are under construction
and another four are in the planning stage.
   The town of Sosua 10 miles to the east was a sleepy dairy
community five years ago. Now, 30 hotels are under construction,
dairy farms are being sold to developers and land prices have
skyrocketed.
   A similar boom in tourism and construction is taking place in
the rest of the Caribbean, where the number of visitors topped 9
million for the first time last year _ up 12 percent from 1986.
   Jamaica, Puerto Rico and other places have undertaken major
construction programs, and estimates on the number of rooms being
built right now range up to 20,000.
   That concerns some tourism officials, who wonder where the
tourists will come from to fill all the rooms. After two record
years in a row, the number of visitors to the region this year is
likely to stabilize at 1987 levels.
