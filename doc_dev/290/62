  [Text] The International Seabed Authority is now located in 
Jamaica. The Authority is expected to hold its first meeting in 
Kingston on the 16th of November. This follows an agreement 
reached by the developed nations of the world on June 3 to 
ratify the United Nations convention on the Law of the Sea. 
This disclosure was made by Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade Dr. Paul Robertson during his contribution to the 1994-95 
sectoral debate. Philip Hamilton has more: 
  [Begin recording] [Hamilton] The breakthrough follows years 
of intense debate between the United Nations and several 
industrialzed countries where technology [words indistinct]. 
The United States had long opposed the section of the 
convention dealing with the mining of seabed resources, an issue 
which saw them refusing to ratify the convention for well over a 
decade. Minister Robertson told parliament that Jamaica had 
played a key role in the agreement, which will be presented for 
adoption next month at the special UN General Assembly. 
  [Robertson] The main, outstanding issue involved the role 
and 
activities of the multilaterally owned enterprise in the mining 
of the seabed as against private entities. That was the 
sticking point why a number of the industrialized countries did 
not sign. 
  [Hamilton] But there has been much controversy over the site 
for the Seabed Authority's headquarters. Although Kingston was 
chosen as the headquarters interim site several years ago, 
Montego Bay has been lobbying hard for the Authority's permanent 
home. Minister Robertson says it will be some time before the 
permanent headquarters is constructed in Jamaica. He says the 
site will be determined by the United Nations based on several 
criteria, among them infrastructure as well as security.
