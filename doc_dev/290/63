   U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper was remembered
Tuesday by admirers and political foes alike as a ``rare human
being'' who championed the rights of the elderly and poor and led
Florida into the modern era.
   ``The sense of loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory
of a lifetime full of achievements on behalf of all people,'' Gov.
Bob Martinez said shortly after it was announced that Pepper, 88,
had died in Washington.
   ``He was a rare human being and we are all richer for his
presence among us,'' Martinez said. ``We will miss him very much.''
   Pepper represented the 18th Congressional District, which covers
most of Miami and all of Miami Beach, Bal Harbour and Key Biscayne.
Its center is Miami's heavily Cuban Eighth Street, or Calle Ocho,
and 50 percent of the district is Hispanic.
   A special election will be held to fill Pepper's seat, but it
could not be held for at least 40 days because of the minimum
intervals for filing and two primary elections that would have to
be held.
   Tributes came from all over Florida, which Pepper watched grow
from mostly rural land into the nation's fourth most-populous state
and which became home to many of the senior citizens whose cause he
championed.
   ``He always said it was the senior citizens who made this
country great,'' said Leila Johnson, a resident of Mildred and
Claude Pepper Towers, a federally subsidized senior-citizen
apartment complex named for Pepper and his late wife.
   Mrs. Johnson said she never really understood how she could be
important until she heard Pepper outline his belief that, after
working to raise and educate their children, senior citizens like
her are still contributing to society.
   ``In my life, he made me think that maybe I did make a
contribution,'' said Mrs. Johnson, 74. ``He really made me feel
important.''
   Sen. Bob Graham praised his fellow Florida Democrat as ``a
champion for justice _ for civil rights, for a prepared America to
defeat Nazi tyranny and for dignity for older Americans.''
   ``America will miss this champion,'' Graham said, ``but we will
honor his memory by renewing our dedication to his ideals of
justice and human dignity.''
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack recalled that Pepper once served
with his maternal grandfather, Morris Sheppard, who represented
Texas in the Senate for 42 years.
   ``Congressman Pepper will be missed _ not only by those of us
who served with him _ but by Americans everywhere whose lives are
now better because of his dedication and leadership,'' Mack said.
   ``Senator Pepper was as old as this century, yet he was perhaps
the first of our modern leaders for the new Florida,'' said Florida
House Speaker Tom Gustafson.
   ``When you consider he was a man who knew Orville Wright and
welcomed the astronauts back from the moon, you have an
understanding of the span of history he represented,'' said
Democratic state Sen. Jack Gordon of Miami Beach, Pepper's friend
for 30 years.
