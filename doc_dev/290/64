   A honeymoon in paradise turned into a
nightmare for newlyweds who wound up sharing their closet with
another couple as a shelter against the fury of Hurricane Gilbert.
   ``Next time we're going to the (Wisconsin) Dells,'' said Jay
Charles, 23, who returned from Jamaica to Green Bay on Thursday
with his wife, Vicky, 23.
   ``It was frightening, and very sad,'' Charles said. ``It made us
sick to our stomachs. Those people didn't have much to live in
before. And the people who run the shops ... well, the tourists are
their life.''
   The Charleses, both registered nurses at Bellin Memorial
Hospital, flew out of Jamaica on one of the first commercial
flights leaving the vacation island.
   The Bellevue couple had flown to Jamaica on Sept. 7, four days
after their wedding. They stayed at a hotel about 10 miles up the
coast from Montego Bay.
   Charles said he was reassured by hotel officials Sunday night
that the weather wouldn't be a problem.
   ``When we woke up Monday morning, there was a note under our
door that a hurricane was coming,'' he said. ``We were on the
fourth floor and they moved us to the third floor. But we were
never told anything the whole time.''
   They spent Monday walking around the village. That day they saw
a grass hut in front of the hotel blow away and decided to take
cover.
   ``Another honeymoon couple hid in our closet and we got under
the bed,'' Charles said. ``But then the glass started to crash and
we got in the closet with them.''
   They barricaded themselves with mattresses and stayed in the
closet for almost two hours.
   ``Everything was shaking and we could hear the roof coming
off,'' Charles said. ``Windows were crashing in and we had some
water come under the closet door. It was frightening.''
   The Charleses later offered their medical help to hotel
officials.
   That night, they shared their room with eight people.
   The newlyweds had three choices of places to go for their
honeymoon, Charles said: ``Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cancun.''
   All three were hit by the hurricane.
