  [Text] Jamaica will not be expected to bear any cost as a 
result of the processing of Haitians on U.S. ships in Jamaican 
waters. This is established in a memorandum of understanding 
about the establishment of [words indistinct]. The minister of 
foreign affairs, Dr. Paul Robertson, says he is making it clear 
that in no way will existing Jamaican resources be diverted as a 
result of the arrangement. He said the processing of Haitian 
refugees for entry to the United States will take place aboard a 
U.S. vessel which will be moored about a mile off Lime Cay, 
above Kingston Harbor. The ship on which no processing will 
take place will operate closer to the harbor. Dr. Robertson 
said Jamaica is putting itself on the line because people are 
dying, people are being killed every day in Haiti [word 
indistinct], and we in the Caribbean have to do more than just 
[word indistinct] talk. He says the operation is expected to 
begin within 10 to 14 days, during which time Jamaica will be 
making preparations (?with the) U.S. assembling its personnel 
after which [words indistinct] are expected to remain for six 
months. 
  The opposition Jamaica Labor Party is opposed to the move, 
but the Republican Party is supporting it. The Republicans 
think, however, that the United Nations and the United States 
(?should) do more to resolve the situation in Haiti. And the 
Caribbean human rights network, Caribbean Rights, has welcomed 
the decision by Jamaica to allow the processing of Haitian 
refugees in territorial waters.
