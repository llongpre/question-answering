   More than 200 alleged Jamaican gang members were in
custody today as police and federal agents continued sweeps across
the country aimed at breaking up violent drug rings that
authorities blame for 1,400 murders.
   About 435 members of the gangs, or ``posses,'' are being sought
in 20 states, out of an estimated total gang population of 10,000,
said U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   ``The government has alleged that the Jamaican posses are among
the largest traffickers in crack cocaine, which is aimed especially
at young people,'' the attorney general said in Washington.
   Posse members, known by nicknames like Kong, Storyteller, Stand
Steady and Banana, also are accused of drive-by intimidation
shootings and cold-blooded multiple slayings around the country.
   ``They are known to be involved with over 1,400 drug-related
murders since January 1985, as well as kidnapping, robberies,
assaults, domestic and international gun trafficking, money
laundering and fraud,'' Thornburgh said.
   One of those still being sought was Vivian Blake, an alleged
ringleader of the Shower Posse who has been identified by various
law enforcement officials as the son of a key adviser to former
Jamaican Prime Minister Norman Manley.
   The Shower Posse is one of mre than 40 Jamaican gangs believed
operating in the country.
   A 62-count indictment unsealed Thursday in Miami charged that
Blake and 33 other alleged members of the Shower Posse participated
in cocaine and marijuana smuggling, illegal arms purchases and
racketeering, including nine killings. ``This is the first time
that a Jamaican drug gang has been indicted in the United States as
an enterprise,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   Blake, charged with the most serious counts, faces a maximum of
390 years in prison and $15.5 million in fines.
   The indictment accused some of the posse members of
participating in the execution-style slaying of five people at a
Miami apartment in November 1984. One victim was a pregnant woman
found in a praying position as if pleading for her life,
investigators said. She had been shot six times.
   The gangs are known for their elusiveness, changing names and
addresses so often that by the time police learn them, they have
moved and adopted new names, said Joe Vince, an agent for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The posses grew out of gangs formed in the slums of Jamaica and
have carried their activities and bloody feuds to the streets of
the United States in an effort to expand their control of drug
trafficking, officials said.
   ``They get a lot of young men from the ghettos in Kingston to
work for them,'' Vince said. ``They're called `silkies' because the
gang buys them a silk suit. They always carry 9 mm pistols.''
   The arrests, which began Wednesday night, cover 20 states but
were focused in Houston, Miami and New York, said Stephen Higgins,
the bureau's director.
   The indictment also accused posse members of involvement in
another murder in Miami, one in New York City and two in Los
Angeles.
   The murders are elements of racketeering charges; there is no
federal murder charge that would apply, although murder charges
could be brought separately by local authorities.
   The indictment also charged the suspects with the illegal
purchase of weapons in Dayton, Ohio, and of trying to bribe
witnesses in New York to protect the posse from investigation.
   The Shower Posse's principal business was smuggling cocaine and
marijuana from the Bahamas and distributing the drugs in suitcases
to New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, Canada and other locations,
authorities allege.
   Two of the Shower Posse's four alleged ringleaders, Errol
Hussing and Tony Bruce, are in custody in New York, Lehtinen said.
Another, Lester Coke, is in jail in Jamaica.
   Coke, a well-known Jamaican contractor who has had a
high-profile role in Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga's
political campaigns, is in jail in Kingston awaiting trial on a
murder charge.
   Federal agents, with state and local police, were making the
latest arrests, which were being coordinated by the Organized Crime
Drug Enforcement Task Force representing half a dozen federal
agencies involved in combating drug trafficking.
   The sweep includes Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Chicago;
Cleveland; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Houston,
Texas; Kansas City; Las Vegas, Nev.; Los Angeles; Miami; New
Orleans; New York; Norfolk, Va.; Philadelphia; Raleigh, N.C.;
Washington; and Martinsburg, W.Va.
