   Michael Manley, who led a pro-Cuban
socialist government in the 1970s, swept to victory Thursday over
conservative Prime Minister Edward Seaga in an election marred by
gunfire and allegations of widespread fraud.
   With 65 percent of the ballots counted, Jamaica Broadasting
Corp., the government-run television network, declared Manley's
party the winner of at least 34 of the 60 seats in Parliament. The
network declared Seaga's party the winner of eight seats, with the
remaining 18 undecided as of 10 p.m. EST.
   Under the Jamaica's British-modeled system, the party winning a
majority of parliamentary seats forms the government.
   In the popular vote, Manley's left-leaning People's National
Party led Seaga's right-of-center Jamaica Labor Party vote 57
percent to 43 percent, or 429,680 votes to 324,486.
   ``Let us set an example for all future generations of dignity and
cooperation in victory,'' Manley told a cheering throng outside
party quarters in Kingston.
   It is ``not given to many people a second chance to serve a
nation,'' he added.
   The results closely matched the findings of an opinion poll
Sunday that predicted Manley's party would capture 48 of the 60
seats of Parliament. Seaga's party now holds all 60 seats.
   Seaga conceded at 10:45 p.m. EST.
   ``The people have spoken and we abide by their decision,'' he
said at party headquarters. ``We can hold our heads high as a
previous government and we'll hold our heads high as an opposition.''
   He added: ``We shall take our defeat with a smile,'' indicating
he would not challenge the results.
   Manley was prime minister from 1972 to 1980. His government then
embraced Cuba, alarming the United States and foreign investors, but
he lately has projected a more moderate image. Seaga has been one of
the Caribbean region's strongest U.S. allies.
   Many polling stations closed early because of the violence, and
soldiers fired shots and used tear gas to break up skirmishes.
Sporadic gunfire left one woman dead and at least six others wounded.
   Throughout the day, the two candidates accused each other of
fraud, intimidation and voting irregularities.
   The killing of Glenna Williams, a 25-year-old pregnant houswife,
raised to at least 12 the number of people killed in politically
related violence since the campaign opened Jan. 15. Seaga said Mrs.
Williams was shot a minute before he arrived to vote.
   It was Jamaica's first nationally contested election since 1980,
when an estimated 700 people were killed in political violence over
a nine-month campaign.
   This campaign was shortened to just over three weeks because of
fears of violence at the height of the island's winter tourist
season.
   Attacks were confined mainly to slums in Kingston, the capital,
and a few towns where armed gangs control large voting blocs.
Montego Bay and other beach resorts on the northern coast were calm.
   About 10,000 police and soldiers were deployed to maintain order
at more than 6,000 polling stations.
   Some stations closed early because of the disturbances and fraud
allegations. Moments before Seaga's motorcade drove through a
central Kingston neighborhood, soldiers fired shots in the air and
used tear gas to break up fighting and skirmishes outside polling
stations. Similar incidents were reported across the country.
   About 1 million people were eligible to vote in this country of
2.4 million people, and lines formed early. Although there was no
official estimate, voter turnout was heavy.
   Manley voted at a probation office in Kingston. He said he
awakened at 5:30 a.m. to check polling stations where there might be
trouble.
   He said Seaga supporters were harassing his supporters verbally
at one polling station, and five other stations lacked red ink to
mark voters' fingers to prevent people from casting multiple ballots.
   Noting the atmosphere was less charged than in 1980, Manley said
Jamaicans were ``returning to former habits'' of holding peaceful
elections.
   After voting at a Kingston high school, Seaga accused his
opposition of fraud.
   ``The level of stealing of ballot boxes and stuffing of ballot
boxes, backed by intimidation and pressure from adjoining areas and
by leading political figures is something that's undefinable,''
Seaga said.
   Seaga said Mrs. Williams was killed ``a minute before I got
there. I saw her dead right there.'' Police said she was shot when a
man fired at party supporters.
   A member of Seaga's party, Sen. George Ramocan, said Manley's
supporters intimidated some voters and that men posing as policemen
stole ballot boxes from a polling station in a Seaga stronghold.
   Manley dismised Seaga's charges, saying, ``Frankly, the charge is
a pathetic excuse for the anticipated defeat for the Jamaica Labor
Party.''
   Jamaica's leading pollster, Carl Stone of the University of the
West Indies, forecast Manley's party would win 48 seats.
   Manley and the People's National Party boycotted the last
election in 1983 in a dispute over voter registration.
   Seaga sought a third consecutive term, something no prime
minister has achieved since universal suffrage in 1944.
   The campaign centered on bread-and-butter issues and the
contrasting personalities of Seaga and Manley.
   Seaga, 58, is regarded as a skillful manager, but aloof and
autocratic. Manley, 64, a powerful orator with an engaging
personality, is seen by supporters a champion of the little people.
   Manley has said he would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba _
broken by Seaga in 1980 _ but that priority would be given to good
relations with the Bush administration.
   Seaga, Boston-born and Harvard-educated, was the first official
foreign visitor to the Reagan White House in 1981 and supported the
1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   Although Seaga restored Jamaica's tattered economy, he raised
taxes and devalued the currency, cutting deeply into the buying
power of poorly paid wage earners.
