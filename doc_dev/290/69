A Panamanian cargo ship carrying 913 new Toyota and Nissan cars collided with a 
Chinese tanker and sank in the Seto Inland Sea off western Japan this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The 7,628-ton auto carrier Orange Coral collided with the 2,785-ton Shamrock 
Ocho 4 miles off western Japan in a dense fog. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 South Korean crewmen on the cargo ship were rescued by a nearby ship, 
but it will be more than a week before salvage crews can raise the vessel, a 
spokesman for the Maritime Safety Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars will be returned to the car companies, but there is no hope they can 
be used again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese tanker was damaged, but its cargo of light oil did not leak.
