FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Jamaica safer than US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crime-weary Jamaica is touting the results of a new study which found that
visitors are at higher risk in various US cities than in Jamaica. A study by
Richard Bennett of American University, Washington, found that visitors are
three times more likely to be killed in the US capital than in Jamaica.
Using 1992 statistics, the study compared Washington, Orlando, Miami and New
York with the Jamaican resorts of Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, Negril and Port
Antonio. It was found that Jamaica's resorts have a combined murder rate of
22.58 per 100,000, compared with 75.21 per 100,000 for Washington and 37.89
per 100,000 for Miami.
