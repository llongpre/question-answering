   Doctors are waiting for test results to
decide how to treat Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, who was
hospitalized with pneumonia, an aide to the prime minister said.
   Manley, 65, was flown here from Kingston by air ambulance early
Monday, according to a statement from Jamaica House in Kingston.
   Carol Smith, nursing coordinator on duty at the Miami Heart
Institute, said early today she had been told Manley's condition
was ``unchanged,'' but she was unaware what condition he was in.
   Mrs. Smith said further information was unavaiable.
   Hartley Neita, an aide traveling with Manley, said Monday it was
unclear how long Manley would be hospitalized.
   ``He has been undergoing tests and we're waiting now for the
results of those tests,'' he said. ``From there on, the doctors
will go full blast on treatment.
   He said Manley watched part of the French Open tennis tournament
Monday on television, but spent most of the day resting.
   Earlier, President Bush sent a message to Manley through the
U.S. Embassy in Kingston expressing concern for the prime
minister's health.
   On Sunday, Manley was admitted to Kingston's University
Hospital, where the pneumonia was diagnosed.
   Manley was scheduled to undergo prostate surgery June 5 at
Sloane Kettering Cancer Institute in New York, Neita said. But
doctors were ``watching his prognosis'' to see if that operation
would be postponed, the aide said.
   A socialist, Manley lost the 1980 elections but returned to
office in February 1989 after he moderated his politics. He was
prime minister from 1972-1980.
