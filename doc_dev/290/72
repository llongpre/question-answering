   The defense minister has told a military tribunal
that a highly decorated general accused of trafficking in cocaine
also smuggled ivory and diamonds and should receive a punishment
that sets an example.
   The 47-member tribunal was to hold a second closed-door session
today to consider the case against Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who is
alleged to have been involved with Colombia's Medellin drug cartel
for three years.
   The tribunal of top-ranking officers is to decide if the general
is to be stripped of his rank and ordered to stand trial on the
charges.
   With his voice at times rising in anger, Gen. Raul Castro told
the tribunal on Sunday that Ochoa's actions ``represent an outrage,
a stab in the back to the fatherland and a slap in the face.''
   He said Ochoa should receive ``punishment that sets an example''
because he was such a highly regarded officer.
   Gen. Castro is the brother of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Ochoa, 57, is one of only five officers who hold the medal of the
Hero of the Republic of Cuba. A veteran of the Cuban revolution, he
was decorated for his service as a field commander of Cuban troops
in Angola.
   Gen. Castro's allegation about ivory and diamond smuggling
represented a new dimension in the biggest scandal to rock Cuban
power circles in 30 years of Communist rule. Authorities say Ochoa
was the ringleader of officers who let cocaine smugglers use Cuban
military air bases and arranged escorts for drug-carrying boats.
   The defense minister's speech was broadcast on on state-run
television during the evening newscast, which devoded 40 minute to
the hearing. A newscaster said eight witnesses, all military
officers, also testified.
   Gen. Castro said fellow officers had disapproved as early as 1970
of Ochoa's joking manner and frequent bragging about business deals.
They suspected corruption, but it was not proven until later, he
said.
   ``Only he could explain, if he has been able to explain it to
himself, how this process occurred in which his highest aspiration
becomes transforming himself into a typical capitalist
businessman,'' Gen. Castro said.
   He also accused Ochoa of demoralizing officers in Angola by
saying, ``They have sent me to a lost war so that they can hang the
defeat on me.''
   The Cuban troops were sent to Angola to back a Marxist government
in its fight against a rebel insurgency. A cease-fire in the
conflict took effect over the weekend.
   Ochoa sat with his head bowed and a tense look on his face during
Gen. Castro's speech.
   After Ocho's arrest June 12, Cuba reported that 10 other military
officers and government officials were accused of accepting bribes
from drug traffickers.
   U.S. prosecutors say the names of some of the Cuban officers had
surfaced in a U.S. investigation of a smuggling ring that culminated
in two indictments and a 1988 trial.
   On Saturday, the Cuban military announced that it would shoot
down private planes that violate Cuban airspace and refuse orders to
land for inspection. The announcement said Cuba intended to stop
drug-smuggling planes from using its airspace.
   The official Granma newspaper has said U.S. allegations about
Cuba being a way station for cocaine traffickers prompted Castro to
order the investigation that led to the arrest of Ochoa and the
other officers.
   A Foreign Ministry official, asked about reports that U.S.
officials want to talk to Ochoa, did not rule out the possibility.
   ``These things are from top level to top level,'' the Ministry
official said. ``This sort of thing has been done before.''
