   Five days after Hurricane Gilbert
pounded this Caribbean island, life for hundreds of thousands of
residents has been reduced to finding clean water, something to eat
and a dry place to sleep.
   A state of emergency was in effect today in disaster areas,
where nearly half the nation's 2.3 million people live.
   At least 26 people died on this island as the storm, which
forecasters called the most intense on record, swept across the
Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula this week before heading
for the northern Mexican coast.
   A half million Jamaicans were left homeless by Gilbert after it
hit the island's east coast, and 80 percent of the country's
500,000 homes were severely damaged or destroyed.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga told a news conference Friday that
food stamps would soon be distributed to those most in need.
   The state-owned Jamaica Press reported that to prevent the
spread of disease, the government was trying to move people out of
refugee shelters and back to their homes, if the homes had not been
destroyed.
   On Friday, work crews covered roofless government buildings with
plastic sheets, replaced snapped utility poles and cleared streets
of debris.
   The Jamaica Broadcasting Corp. broadcast health bulletins urging
people to boil their water.
   Children bathed with soap at an open water hydrant in downtown
Kingston, and people filled plastic jugs at a burst water main.
   Many people stood in long lines to get into grocery stores
guarded by helmeted soldiers and dogs.
   Women and children balanced large water containers on their
heads or waited patiently in line to fill cans of cooking kerosene.
   Gilbert devastated what was already a weak economy with one out
of four workers unemployed. The banana and poultry industries were
destroyed and tourism, the No. 1 foreign exchange earner, faced an
uncertain future.
   One bright spot was a report by Minister of Mining and Tourism
Hugh Hart that the main aluminum and bauxite plants received little
or no damage. The minerals are among Jamaica's major exports.
   Seaga, who estimated total damage from the storm at $8 billion,
said reconstruction would require ``the largest-scale international
assistance we have ever mobilized'' _ from $300 million to $400
million worth.
   On Friday, emergency relief supplies had already arrived from
the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany and other
countries, and nearly all of Jamaica's Caribbean neighbors pledged
assistance.
   The state-owned Jamaica Press said American Airlines, Air
Jamaica and other carriers agreed to airlift supplies from New York
free of charge.
   Seaga invoked emergency powers by declaring much of the island a
disaster area Thursday night. He ordered the immediate reopening of
gasoline stations and stores that sell vital supplies.
   Seaga also imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew to prevent looting.
   President Reagan sent a letter to Seaga expressing his and
America's ``deepest sympathy for the tragic loss of life'' from the
storm, said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater in Washington.
   ``The United States will play an active role in helping Jamaica
rebuild for a bright and prosperous future,'' said the letter.
   Jamaica canceled its ``Come Back to Jamaica'' television
commercials Thursday, but travel agents in New York reported that
many people who had booked tours to the island were still planning
to go.
   Seaga was quoted by Jamaica Press as saying that damage to
``four or five'' hotels had been reported and they had closed
temporarily. Others were operating with limited services, he said.
   In Haiti, military ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy issued a brief
statement Friday night expressing sympathy with Haitian victims of
Gilbert.
   Ten people drowned when their boat sank Sunday night off the
southern coast of Haiti. The government declared a state of
emergency in three southern departments.
   In the Dominican Republic, where the storm caused flooding and
widespread damage to crops, five had been reported dead.
   The Cayman Islands, which also was in the hurricane's path,
reported very minor damage, with 51 homeless out of total
population of 23,000. Phones in some areas still out of order
Friday and thousands of trees were blown down, but no significant
damage was done to buildings.
