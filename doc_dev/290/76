   Rep. Claude Pepper was remembered in
the state he represented in Washington for half a century as a
tireless advocate for the elderly and poor, a powerful orator and a
charming, humble man.
   ``He was a particularly talented and able man who didn't have
any selfishness in him,'' said Rep. Charles Bennett, 78, a Democrat
and now dean of the state's congressional delegation. ``He was just
interested in what he could do for mankind.''
   The body of the 88-year-old congressman, who died Tuesday, will
lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Thursday, a measure of
respect typically reserved for national heroes. He will be buried
in Tallahassee next to his wife, Mildred, who died of cancer in
1979.
   Tributes came from admirers and political foes from all over
Florida, which Pepper watched grow from mostly rural land into the
nation's fourth most-populous state, and home to many of the senior
citizens whose cause he championed.
   ``The sense of loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory
of a lifetime full of achievements on behalf of all people,'' said
Gov. Bob Martinez.
   ``He always said it was the senior citizens who made this
country great,'' said Leila Johnson, a 74-year-old resident of
Mildred and Claude Pepper Towers, a federally subsidized
senior-citizen apartment complex in Miami, where the flag flew at
half staff.
   Mrs. Johnson remembered Pepper telling her that after working to
raise and educate their children, senior citizens are still
contributing to society.
   ``In my life, he made me think that maybe I did make a
contribution,'' she said.
   Pepper served in the Senate from 1936 to 1950, when he lost a
re-election bid after being branded ``Red Pepper'' and charged with
being soft on the Soviet Union. He taught and practised law until
winning election to the House in 1962.
   Sen. Bob Graham praised his fellow Florida Democrat as ``a
champion for justice _ for civil rights, for a prepared America to
defeat Nazi tyranny and for dignity for older Americans.
   ``America will miss this champion but we will honor his memory
by renewing our dedication to his ideals of justice and human
dignity.''
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack recalled that Pepper once served
with his maternal grandfather, Morris Sheppard, who represented
Texas in the Senate for 42 years. He said Pepper would be missed
``by Americans everywhere whose lives are now better because of his
dedication and leadership.''
   ``Senator Pepper was as old as this century, yet he was perhaps
the first of our modern leaders for the new Florida,'' said Florida
House Speaker Tom Gustafson.
   ``When you consider he was a man who knew Orville Wright and
welcomed the astronauts back from the moon, you have an
understanding of the span of history he represented,'' said
Democratic state Sen. Jack Gordon of Miami Beach, Pepper's friend
for 30 years.
   Despite his age, Pepper never lost his oratorial skills that
made him famous on the House floor.
   ``He could spellbind an audience,'' said Hal Wilkins, vice
president of development for Florida State University in
Tallahassee, which has the Mildred and Claude Pepper Library and
custody of the congressman's papers. ``He could walk into a room
filled with people and the whole room would light up.''
   Polly Sermon, a Pepper Towers resident, said she had known
Pepper since 1932 and wouldn't be living in the housing complex if
it weren't for him.
   ``He was strictly for the senior citizens _ the rock of
Gibraltar,'' Ms. Sermon said. ``If he promised you anything, you
got it. He was here for us.''
   Pepper represented the 18th Congressional District, which covers
most of Miami and all of Miami Beach, Bal Harbour and Key Biscayne.
Its center is Miami's heavily Cuban Eighth Street, or Calle Ocho,
and 50 percent of the district is Hispanic.
   A special election will be held to fill the seat.
