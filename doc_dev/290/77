   Two Jamaicans wanted on drug-trafficking,
racketeering and murder charges in the United States were arrested
in Jamaica, the U.S. Marshals Service said on Thursday.
   Both were arrested this week by Jamaican police near Kingston,
the Caribbean nation's capital.
   ``This is the first time the Jamaican government has begun
extradition procedures against Jamaican citizens,'' in cooperation
with the U.S. government, said Joyce McDonald, spokeswoman for the
Marshal Service.
   Officials said the pair are believed to be leaders of a Jamaican
organized crime group known as the ``Shower Posse'' based in
Florida.
   One of the men, Richard Orville Morrison, 35, is among the
service's ``15 Most Wanted'' fugitives and has been sought on
federal drug charges since October 1988.
   Lester Coke, 42, has been wanted since September 1988 on
narcotics and racketeering charges, including nine murders.
   Morrison also was named along with Coke in a November 1984
killing in Miami.
   They are being held pending extradition to the United States.
