   Security forces have arrested the father
of three reputed leaders of the Medellin cocaine cartel, the cartel
leaders' sister told a local radio station.
   Fabio Ochoa, father of Jorge Luis, Juan David and Fabio, was
detained Monday at his ranch on the outskirts of Medellin, said
Marta Nieves Ochoa. She contacted Caracol radio in Medellin to
report the arrest, a reporter said.
   Police said Monday that they could not confirm the arrest.
   Miss Ochoa said her father was arrested along with his wife and
50 other suspects, mostly workers at the ranch.
   There was no immediate explanation of why Ochoa, a life-long
rancher, would be arrested. Although his sons are among Colombia's
most wanted men, he faces no criminal charges.
   The elder Ochoa has been arrested on two other occassions, but
was released each time.
   Miss Ochoa said her father was detained by plainclothesmen who
descended on the ranch from two helicopters, according to the
Caracol reporter. She said military vehicles surrounded the area
shortly thereafter.
   The Ochoa brothers are said to be the most powerful force in the
Medellin cartel after Pablo Escobar, the gang's leader. Both
Escobar and the Ochoas remain at large.
   A year ago, the government began a crackdown on Colombian
traffickers, who once provided about 80 percent of the cocaine on
U.S. markets. The crackdown included extraditing drug runners for
prosecution in the United States.
   Drug lords have responded with a terror campaign of bombings and
assassinations.
