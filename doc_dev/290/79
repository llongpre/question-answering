   Officials from Jamaica and the Cayman Islands in
Miami readied relief efforts Tuesday as they anxiously awaited
details on the damage wrought by Hurricane Gilbert's passage
through their home islands.
   A U.S. Air Force C-130 plane with international and U.S.
officials aboard went to Jamaica to set up a satellite
communication system to coordinate help in the giant hurricane's
aftermath.
   ``This hurricane from what I can gather is about the worst in
its (Jamaica's) history,'' said Percival R. Todd, Jamaica's deputy
consul-general in Miami. ``It just souped up over the entirety of
Jamaica. There's no place on the island that escaped.''
   Gilbert missed most of Florida, bringing strong winds, rain
squalls and tides 1 to 2 feet above normal to the Florida Keys. But
officials of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, a British colony, were
preparing to hear the worst.
   ``We experienced Hurricane Charlie, so we're accustomed to
savage attacks by tropical storms,'' Todd said. Charlie was the
last major hurricane to strike the island directly, claiming 111
lives in 1951, he said.
   Serious flooding had already swamped the Cayman Islands by
Tuesday afternoon, and officials there expected heavy damage, said
Erina Nichols, a spokeswoman for the Cayman Island Department of
Tourism in Miami.
   Nichols said a relief center for the Caymans was accepting
donations in Miami, and three centers in Dade County were
collecting food, clothing and medical supplies for Jamaicans left
homeless or injured by the hurricane.
   Three Air Jamaica planes full of supplies were ready to fly from
Miami International Airport to Jamaica once an airport there was
confirmed to be safe, said Rupert Williams, commander of the St.
John Ambulance Brigade of Jamaica's Army Medical Corps.
   ``With 150 mph winds lasting 10 hours over Jamaica, it has to be
serious,'' Williams said. The relief effort was being coordinated
by the Jamaican Consulate and Metro-Dade County, Kingston's
``sister city,'' he said.
   Both of Jamaica's major airports were reported to be seriously
damaged, but the Air Force plane was able to land. Aboard was a
team of U.S. State Department disaster specialists, Metro-Dade Fire
Rescue communications experts, Pan-American Health Organization
officials and Jamaica's Miami Consul-General Marie Wray.
   In Broward County, Ingrid Brice said the Jamaican community was
responding to pleas for help with promises of food and clothing,
and volunteers including nurses and doctors.
   ``It's been overwhelming,'' she said.
