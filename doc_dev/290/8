   Worried Jamaican-Americans clung to the telephone and listened
to news reports about their hurricane-ravaged homeland, but
information was scant as makeshift collection centers readied tons
of supplies for the Caribbean island.
   ``The response has been marvelous. It's always so where our
country is concerned,'' said Lancelot Evans, a spokesman for the
Jamaican Consulate in Miami.
   Hurricane Gilbert swept over Jamaica on Monday, killing at least
19 people and destroying one-fifth of the nation's 500,000 homes in
what was described by Prime Minister Edward Seaga as the country's
worst natural disaster ever.
   ``Kingston was beautiful. Now they can't even recognize it,''
said Vincent Clive Kirkland of Miami, who was waiting for the
chance to bring food and medicine to his family in St. Mary,
Jamaica.
   ``Jamaica is not like America. People do not have insurance. It
will all be their expense,'' Kirkland added. ``If there's any help
the United States can give, we're going to need it.''
   In the New York area, home to the nation's largest Jamaican
community, estimated at 300,000 to 600,000 people, a Brooklyn
health clinic began accepting food, clothing and bedding for
shipment to Jamaica. Several local Caribbean groups also set up
relief funds.
   Nicola Taylor, 27, an administrative assistant for a hotel firm,
said she has been trying since Tuesday to contact her parents and a
sister in the small town of St. Ann's, near Kingston.
   ``The calls won't go through,'' she said. ``This is driving me
up a wall.''
   The United States government, meanwhile, is sending $396,000
worth of supplies to Jamaica, the Agency for International
Development said. The supplies include 360 rolls of plastic
sheeting, 200 tents, 3,966 water jugs, 18 water tanks, 10 chain saw
kits and 9,600 cotton blankets.
   A portion of the assistance was flown by the military from a
U.S. stockpile in Panama on Wednesday.
   Jamaican officials expect Kingston's Norman Manley International
Airport to open soon for emergency flights, Evans said. When it
does, tons of food, clothing, medicine and building materials
gathered here will be sent.
   Air Jamaica as well as U.S. carriers Midway Airlines and Eastern
Airlines promised to fly supplies to Jamaica for free.
   Hundreds of doctors and nurses from Dade and Broward counties in
Florida also are on standby if the Jamaican government requests
medical assistance.
   ``We're planning now _ waiting for communication to open,'' said
Joanne Gonzalez, spokeswoman for the Jamaican United Relief
Association in southern Florida. ``Once the government requests, we
will go.''
   Some 50,000 to 60,000 Jamaicans live in south Florida. Many
jammed the consulate, waiting nervously for word of conditions back
home, while others staffed makeshift relief supply centers in
homes, offices and restaurants.
   In Oakland, Calif., residents and civic leaders began a drive to
help Oakland's sister city in Jamaica, Ocho Rios, a resort town of
10,000 near Montego Bay.
