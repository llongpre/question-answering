  [Text] Havana, 15 Mar (PL) -- An unexpected summit of the 
Anglo-Caribbean community Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] held 
this weekend clearly established the Antillean countries' hope 
of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 
either as a bloc or separately. 
  The meeting, held on Saturday and Sunday in Kingston, 
capital 
of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and attended by 13 Caricom 
heads of state, focused its attention on ways to join the 
Canadian, U.S., and Mexican trade agreement. 
  For more than a year, Caricom has studied possible ways of 
joining NAFTA and also ways to keep the old Caribbean Basin 
Initiative (CBI) privileges sponsored by former President Ronald 
Reagan's administration in the 1980's. 
  CBI accorded certain Caribbean and Central American products 
tax free access to the U.S. market. The 12-year deadline 
stipulated by the CBI for its implementation, however, is about 
to end and the benefits are threatened by the competition of 
similar products manufactured in Mexico, a NAFTA partner. 
  The Kingston summit reached two conclusions. First, to 
officially ask U.S. Trade representative Mickey Kantor to report 
on Caricom's ability to join NAFTA, and second, to give Trinidad 
and Tobago and Jamaica the green light to negotiate their 
independent admission to the NAFTA. 
  The latter conclusion, which seems to be the result of an 
aggressive campaign by U.S. Ambassador in Trinidad Sally Cowall, 
somehow contradicts the group spirit which has prevailed in 
Caricom negotiations with the world since its creation in 1973. 
  The regional integration organization, although criticized 
for the slow implementation of its financial and commercial 
decisions, still maintains an unfailing unity among its members, 
and it has been the strength behind the Association of Caribbean 
States (CSA), whose constitution will begin to be drafted on 
Wednesday in Jamaica by a group of experts from the 38 potential 
members. 
  The special summit, just two days before the Kingston 
meeting, seems to indicate there are still unexplored areas in 
Caricom's plans for a mechanism that will tie their fragile 
insular economies to those of other more developed Caribbean 
countries, like Cuba, and the so-called medium Latin American 
powers like Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. 
  The Caribbean people are truly facing a situation akin to 
panic given the danger of losing CBI benefits; Latin American 
banana producers' questions concerning their advantages -- 
earned through their colonial heritage -- in the British market; 
and the real threat of NAFTA, which will significantly undermine 
access of their products to the United States. 
  Nevertheless, history has shown the spirit of integration 
which prevails among the small Anglo-Antillean islands is deeply 
rooted and their leaders' unyielding resistance to Washington's 
pressure to exclude Cuba from the future CSA proves it. 
  The future organization, designed to coordinate 
intergovernment cooperation in trade, culture, education, and 
ecology, and to sponsor a future market among its members, 
should include 38 countries from the Caribbean insular, basin, 
and coastal areas with different degrees of development and 
political tendencies. 
  Stages of the project include preparing the constitution, 
which will be handled by experts gathered in Jamaica between 16 
and 18 March; the foreign ministers approving it while in 
Mexico; and the heads of state and government, who will formally 
comprise the CSA, signing it at the Caricom summit in July in 
Barbados. 
  Either way, NAFTA looms over any trade negotiation started 
by 
the CSA because it involves one of the member states -- Mexico 
-- and it significantly affects the other members. 
  Whether Caricom manages to join NAFTA as a group or Jamaica 
and Trinidad forge ahead on their own is still being studied, 
and that decision will surely set the prevailing trend in future 
trade negotiations between the CSA and the United States, which 
always prefers to negotiate bilaterally with the Caribbean 
people given the saying, "divide and conquer."
