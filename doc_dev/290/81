   Hurricane Gilbert damaged 80 percent of
Jamaica's homes, devastated crops and left eastern sections of the
island looking ``like Hiroshima after the atom bomb,'' said Prime
Minister Edward Seaga.
   Speaking to reporters Wednesday after a five-hour inspection
flight over the island, he estimated damage at $8 billion and said
one out of every five homes was destroyed.
   State-run Jamaican Broadcasting Corp., operating by generator,
said at least 19 people were killed when the storm whipped across
the island on Monday.
   The hurricane, the most intense on record, also killed five
people in the Dominican Republic on its sweep westward through the
Caribbean before slamming into Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Wednesday
with 160 mph winds.
   The Jamaican Embassy in Washington said 500,000 of Jamaica's 2.3
million people were rendered homeless, and the government estimated
that about 150,000 people were in distress shelters set up around
the island in sports stadiums, churches, government buildings and
movie theaters.
   In the Dominican Republic, officials reported widespread crop
damage. The country's main electricity relay station remained out
of service Wednesday, leaving half the capital of Santo Domingo
without power.
   Heavy crop damage also was reported in the islands of St. Lucia,
Guadeloupe and St. Vincent.
   Seaga told reporters the storm wiped out 100,000 of Jamaica's
500,000 homes, with another 300,000 damaged: ``We saw whole
villages where not a single building was left standing. It looked
like Hiroshima after the atom bomb.''
   The storm, which dumped up to 10 inches of rain on the island,
wiped out the island's banana crop and poultry industry and heavily
damaged the coconut industry and garden crops, Seaga said.
   Two days after the hurricane's passing, Jamaica remained without
electricity. Most regions still had no water.
   Seaga said damage was widespread along the southern coast west
of Kingston, although not as devastating as on the eastern end.
   The northern coast, where Jamaica's vital tourist industry is
based, escaped the worst of the storm, and only two of the region's
luxury hotels appeared to have suffered noticeable damage.
   In Kingston, Jamaica's capital city of 750,000, trees, zinc
roofs, telephone poles and billboards littered the streets.
Military and civilian volunteers worked in virtually every street,
pulling down collapsed roofs, sweeping up debris, and bringing food
to the homeless.
   At the National Chest Hospital, officials had to contend not
only with storm damage but with looters who stole mattresses and
other supplies.
   Seaga said he had no doubt ``that this is going to be the worst
disaster that we have experienced in our modern history.''
   He said he would hold an emergency Cabinet meeting today to
re-evaluate government reconstruction priorities and projected
costs, as well as Jamaica's requirements in international aid.
   ``Now, our first priority is to provide shelter and
sustenance,'' the prime minister said. ``It's obvious we'll have to
spend much more money than we thought initially we'd have to.''
   The United States has sent in Navy cargo planes with plastic
roof covering and collapsible water storage tanks. Offers of aid
have come from Canada, Britain, France, West Germany and Israel,
Seaga said.
   Government officials said Kingston's Norman Manley Airport,
severely damaged by Gilbert, would reopen to Air Jamaica flights
today or Friday.
   Part of the tarmac for smaller aircraft was littered with
twisted and bent planes Wednesday. A 10-seater sat against a row of
palms, its bruised nose to the ground.
   The embassy in Washington said airports were open for emergency
traffic only, and communications were extremely limited. It said it
had no reports of American victims.
   Power outages forced doctors to conduct surgery by flashlight at
many hospitals, where the winds had caused floods and torn off
roofs.
   The tiny Cayman Islands began returning to normal Wednesday with
no reported deaths, few injuries and much less damage than feared.
The islands' 23,000 people ``got on their knees and said `Thank
you,''' said local journalist Carol Winker.
