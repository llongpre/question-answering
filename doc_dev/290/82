  [Excerpts] On 21 April in Port-au-Prince, Haitian Senate 
President Firmin Jean-Louis presented a bill granting amnesty to 
the authors and accomplices of the coup d'etat that overthrew 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 September 1991. 
Jean-Louis' presentation, accompanied by about 10 other 
senators, took place in a hotel of the capital in the presence 
of representatives of the UN secretary general's Friendly Four 
countries. The following is a report by Pierre Jerome Richard: 
  [Begin recording] [Richard] "The senators who are part of 
the 
normal Senate met the morning of 21 April at the Christopher 
Hotel to propose an amnesty law for the benefit of those who 
participated in the 30 September [1991] coup d'etat, according 
to the senators' report to the press. Several foreign diplomats, 
including Eric Falt, UN spokesman for Haiti; (Mrs. Elza Ocho 
Campe), Venezuelan charge d'affaires; (Francis Fillol), Canadian 
ambassador; and [U.S. Ambassador] William Lacy Swing were 
present at the ceremony, which began at about 1130. Senate 
President Firmin Jean-Louis opened the ceremony. He thanked all 
the diplomats and members of the press who were present. In the 
opinion of Senator Jean-Louis, this proposal is the key to 
unblocking the country's crisis. Sen. Martinez describes the 
contents of this proposal:" 
  [Martinez] Considering that the 30 September 1991 coup 
d'etat, which involved the forced departure of the president of 
the Republic, is an act provided for and punishable by law, and 
this event gave rise to many violations that necessarily took on 
a political character. 
  Considering that the legislative power lays down laws on all 
subjects of public interest, the Senate has voted the following 
law: 
  Article 1. The authors and accomplices of the 29-30 
September 
1991 coup, which entailed the departure of the president of the 
Republic, are granted amnesty. 
  Article. 2. This amnesty law applies to all violations 
ensuing from the coup d'etat, ranging from 29-30 September 1991 
to the date of promulgation of this amnesty law. 
  Article. 3. Regarding the rights of third parties, the 
victims of the acts excused by this law will have recourse to a 
special compensation fund that will be created for that purpose. 
  Article. 4. This law will be published and executed at the 
behest of the ministers of justice and the interior in the areas 
that respectively concern them. 
  [Richard] "Sen. Jean-Louis hopes the international community 
will continue helping the Haitian people in their struggle for 
democracy." [passage omitted] 
  "This proposal, which was supported by 13 out of 17 
senators, 
was adopted by senators from many blocs within the Senate. Among 
those who voted for this law are Julio Larosiliere, Herard 
Pauyo, Turneb Delpe, and Clark Parent. At the conclusion of the 
meeting, we noted the presence of [former] Sen. Reynold Georges 
and Sen. Jacques Rony Mondestin, who were going to bring their 
support to the plan. 
  ``During the ceremony, Sen. Jean-Louis asked everyone 
present 
to sing the country's national anthemn. This is how the ceremony 
ended, with Sen. Jean-Louis, as master of ceremonies, inviting 
the guests to partake of refreshments. Many of the participants 
took advantage of the refreshments to give their opinions. Among 
them was foreign diplomat Eric Falt:'' 
  [Falt] We have been in a deadlock for several months. It is 
a 
proposal aimed at getting out of the current crisis. We can 
congratulate ourselves on that. It is a step in the right 
direction. Regarding the rest, it is first and foremost a 
Haitian issue. [words indistinct] but as a general rule, we 
think it is a step in the right direction that could unblock the 
crisis. 
  [Richard] "The host, Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, asked the press 
to help him popularize the bill. The senator also said he would 
take steps within the Chamber of Deputies to see if it would 
subscribe to this proposal in the future. Pierre Jerome Richard 
for Signal FM." [end recording]
