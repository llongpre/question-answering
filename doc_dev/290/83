  [Text] This afternoon in Kingston, Jamaica and Cuba signed 
a maritime border delimitation treaty establishing national 
waters and continental shelf borders of both countries on the 
basis of equidistant delimitation lines. Jamaican Foreign 
Minister Paul Robertson and Cuban Ambassador Dario Urra headed 
the two delegations and signed the new bilateral accord. 
Robertson stressed that the expediency and ease with which the 
accord was completed reflects the level of existing relations 
between neighboring peoples who share many common traits as 
developing Caribbean states.
