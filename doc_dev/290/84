   Jamaicans voted today in an election
that was expected to unseat Prime Minister Edward Seaga and return
socialist Michael Manley to power. One person was reported killed
and six injured in scattered violence.
   A police spokesman said Glenna Williams, 25, a homemaker, died
when a gunman fired at party supporters accompanying a local
candidate in Kingston.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said another person was
stabbed and five were wounded by gunshots in separate incidents
today.
   Williams' killer fled, said the spokesman, who did not give any
of the victims' party affiliations.
   Shortly before the polls opened at 7 a.m., a man was shot at a
Kingston polling station. The police spokesman said he was shot in
the chest and was in serious condition.
   The independent RJR Radio station identified the man as Keith
Kettle and said he was shot in the backside by a .357-caliber Magnum
revolver wielded by one of eight Seaga supporters who converged on
the polling station.
   RJR began its 7 a.m. newscast with a prayer from the Rev. C.
Everett Bailey, who reminded listeners it was the beginning of Lent
and said, ``Let no one of us be guilty before God of aiding or
abetting any violence.''
   Twelve people have been killed and scores wounded since the
campaign opened Jan. 15.
   Manley, who since the 1970s has moved toward the political
center, was rated a 14-point favorite _ 57 percent of the vote to 43
percent _ in the last opinion poll Sunday.
   Seaga was seeking a third consecutive term, something no Jamaican
government has achieved since universal suffrage in 1944.
   Pollster Carl Stone of the University of the West Indies said
Manley's People's National Party would probably capture 48 of the 60
seats in Parliament. The pollster has correctly predicted the winner
of every Jamaican election since 1972.
   Today is Jamaica's first nationally contested election since 1980.
   Manley boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over
voter registration lists, giving Seaga's center-right Jamaica Labor
Party all 60 parliamentary seats.
   There were allegations of voting irregularities on both sides.
   Manley said he witnessed ``verbal harassment'' of supporters at
one station during a morning tour of polling places. That station
also lacked the red ink voters are supposed to dip their fingers in
to prevent double voting, he said.
   ``They were just openly breaking the law, creating an atmosphere
of hostility,'' Manley said. But he added the irregularities were
not widespread, ``just the odd incident so far, but one is
monitoring the thing.''
   Sen. George Ramacon of Seaga's party accused Manley's party of
ballot stuffing in at least one constituency.
   Military helicopters flew over the capital of 1 million on
election eve as part of a nationwide security operation involving
10,000 soldiers and police.
   Violence has been confined mainly to Kingston's slums, where
heavily armed gangs have traditionally controlled large voting
blocs, and rural areas far from the big tourist hotels on the north
coast.
   Seaga and Manley signed a peace accord in August in an attempt to
prevent violence, but throughout the campaign they accused each
other of breaching it.
   The charismatic Manley, 64, educated at the London School of
Economics, was prime minister from 1972 to 1980. He has projected a
moderate, pro-U.S. image in contrast to his previous far-left
leadership.
   Manley said he would restore relations with neighboring communist
Cuba during his first year in office but only on a restricted and
formal basis. Seaga broke relations with Cuba upon taking office in
1980.
   Seaga, 58, who was born in Boston and educated at Harvard, has
been one of the United States' closest allies in the Caribbean.
   He has helped restore Jamaica's battered economy, but higher
taxes and devaluation of the Jamaican dollar have cut deeply into
the purchasing power of most wage earners and the standard of living
of Jamaica's 2.4 million people has continued to fall.
