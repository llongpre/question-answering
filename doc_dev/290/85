   The nation's tourism industry stands to
lose more than $100 million without emergency repairs to the damage
Hurricane Gilbert did to the island's reputation as a tourist
mecca, officials said.
   They expressed their worries last weekend after Prime Minister
Edward Seaga announced Friday that his government is preparing a
huge advertising campaign to convince foreign tourists that Jamaica
is ready to welcome them again.
   Government officials acknowledge that the storm, the most
intense on record, devastated much of this Caribbean island nation
when it barreled through on Sept. 12. They say tons of food,
medicine and other supplies are pouring in but much more is needed
to feed and shelter tens of thousands left homeless by the storm.
   ``The aid is reaching the people, the problem is the magnitude
of their need,'' said an official close to Seaga. ``It's like an
endless pit, the suffering of the people is greater than the amount
of aid available.''
   But damage to Jamaica's tourist areas was limited, officials
said.
   Peter Rousseau, president of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist
Association, said the country suffered more damage to its
reputation as a tourist haven than it did to its facilities.
   ``It's only about seven properties that have been damaged,'' he
said. ``What has been hurt is the perception of Jamaica.''
   He said the island must counter its new reputation as a disaster
area, turn the overall tourist trade back on and attract as much of
the vital U.S. Midwest market as possible.
   Association members have prepared their own advertising blitzes
and promotions abroad.
   Hugh Hart, minister of Mining, Energy and Tourism, said Gilbert
wreaked havoc over the island and parts of the economy were badly
damaged. But he said some industries, including tourism, suffered
only slight damage.
   The tourist industry sustained about $45 million damage to hotel
roofs and windows, but 85 percent of hotels are back in operation,
the Jamaica Tourism Board reported. It said business could return
to normal by the end of the month.
   However, tourism officials said the industry could lose up to
$130 million without quick action.
   ``Right after Gilbert, we had more cancellations than we wanted
and not as many bookings,'' Hart said. ``Now, it's started to level
off and things seem to be going the other way.''
   Jamaica earned $600 million from stopover visitors in 1987, and
it was expected to earn about the same this year. However, Gilbert
forced a reduction in the target figure of 170,000 visitors for the
last four months of 1988.
   Seaga told Parliament that Gilbert caused $818 million to $1
billion damage in Jamaica, far less than the $8 billion he
estimated earlier. The latest government damage report said the
storm killed 45 people, severely damaged or destroyed half the
country's homes, and caused $200 million in damage to banana,
coconut, coffee and other crops.
   A team from Toronto is heading to Jamaica this week to check
reports that vast amounts of aid supplies are not getting to the
people who need them.
   Paul Kafele, executive director of the Jamaican Canadian
Association which is sending the team, said his group has heard
rumors that ``supplies aren't reaching their rightful
destinations.''
   ``Because things are so chaotic, a dog-eat-dog mentality has set
in,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Col. Franklin Thompson, director of the Kingston
chapter of the Salvation Army, said 300,000 pounds of food and
medical supplies donated by New York's West Indian population was
stranded at Kennedy International Airport for lack of
transportation.
