Jamaica has asked the textile surveillance arm of the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement to resolve a trade dispute with Canada over garments shipped
from the island to the US which then enter Canada, Canute James writes from
Kingston.
Canada has limited the quantity of Jamaican assembled women's underwear
which can enter that country after being shipped from the island under a
trade treaty with the US, according to Jamaican officials.
