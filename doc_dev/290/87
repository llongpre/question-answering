   One man was killed and two others
were reported missing after fire broke out aboard an oil tanker as
it was unloading fuel, officials said Tuesday.
   Another six people were injured as an explosion ripped through
the crew quarters the Filipino-registered Annette II Monday
evening, starting the blaze, local fire officials said.
   They said the vessel was carrying 83,000 barrels of jet fuel,
gasoline, diesel fuel and kerosene with a total value of more than
$2 million. The cargo was being unloaded at the Esso installation
at the Montego Freeport pier.
   There was no immediate word on any fuel spill into the Caribbean
coastal waters. Montego Bay, on Jamaica's northern shore, is in the
heart of the island's main tourist zone.
   Three fireboats, including two from the U.S. Coast Guard, were
battling the blaze. The ship was towed out to sea.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. The dead
man was identified as a Jamaican stevedore, Herman Stephenson.
