More Cubans appear to be leaving the unsupervised south coast of their
country for neighbouring islands in the Caribbean, as Cuban police continue
to patrol sections of Cuba's north coast to deter boat people from heading
for the US.
Government officials in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica said yesterday they
feared the Cuban move to restrict rafters fleeing the north coast, following
the agreement last week by the Cuban and US government to curb illegal
migration, would lead to a southward rush of refugees.
More than 200 refugees arrived in the Cayman Islands over the weekend,
despite an announcement last week by the government of the UK dependency
that all 'economic migrants' would be repatriated. This brings to 620 the
number of Cubans refugees on the Caymans, whose administration said it had
no more money to take care of Cubans.
Cuba's government said at the weekend that, until midday today, it would try
to persuade would-be refugees not to depart in home-made rafts and boats.
'We really don't want to use force,' an official statement said. But it
added that, after the deadline, the authorities would use force if necessary
to stop rafters from leaving, especially if they resisted violently.
After the accord with the US, a flotilla of rafts carrying refugees rushed
to leave beaches near Havana before the authorities moved to stop them.
'The agreement means nothing for us,' said Mr Severo Estupinan, 59, as he
prepared to depart. 'People will keep on leaving.' More than 32,000 Cubans
have fled the recession-hit island this year, most during the last month.
Jamaican immigration officers yesterday began interviewing 25 Cubans who had
walked off a beach and into one of the island's more exclusive north-coast
resort hotels at the weekend. They had left Cuba from the south coast.
'Most of the Cubans coming here, and I presume those going to the Cayman
Islands, want to go eventually to the US,' said a Jamaican government
spokesman.
'But the US is not taking them. If they are not repatriated, their first
port of call - the Caymans and Jamaica - will be their home for some time.'
He said, however, that the Jamaican government did not plan to repatriate
any Cuban refugees.
