   The annual Calle Ocho festival drew crowds estimated
at more than 1 million people to the Little Havana section Sunday
despite a gang-related shooting and controversy over a ban on
singers who performed in Cuba.
   A boy was hospitalized in stable condition following the
shooting, which involved rival youth gangs three blocks from the
edge of the festival, police said. Four juveniles were arrested and
charged with attempted murder.
   Nearly 300 people were arrested at the festival, mostly youths
charged with fighting, drinking or disorderly conduct, police said.
One officer was slightly injured when he was hit above the left eye
with a bottle.
   More than a million people flocked to the 23-block Little Havana
area _ whose main street is Eighth Street, or Calle Ocho _ for Latin
music, dancing and food, according to police and the sponsoring
Kiwanis Club.
   Amid the fun, the weeklong dispute over the ban of singers Denise
de Kalafe, Andy Montanez and De Raymond seemed almost forgotten. The
bans drew sharp criticism from many in Miami, where hard-line
opposition to any contacts with Cuba is not as widespread as in the
past.
   Some remained upset Sunday night.
   ``I would like to see Andy Montanez right here,'' said Jose
Morese of West Palm Beach. ``It's not fair.''
   Food vendor Malee Buther said the controversy may have kept some
people away.
   ``Last year was so crowded, you had to push people to walk,'' she
said. ``This year there are not so many people.''
   Kiwanis officials tried to avoid further controversy involving
Wilfredo Vargas, a Dominican merengue idol who performed for 10,000
dancing fans in Bayside downtown Saturday despite disclosures he
performed in Cuba 10 years ago.
   Kiwanis officials claimed they lacked proof Vargas played in
Cuba, even as a local radio station played excerpts from his
``Habana Jam'' album.
   Vargas declined to answer questions about the issue, discussing
only his performance of fast, Dominican ballroom dance music.
   ``It was a contagious merengue and the people vibrated with the
sound,'' he said.
