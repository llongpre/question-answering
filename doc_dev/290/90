  [Text] The first group of Haitians to be processed off the 
coast of Jamaica arrived in Jamaican waters this morning. The 
Haitian boat people were picked up at sea by a U.S. Coast Guard 
vessel. It is expected that these Haitians will be taken on 
board the processing vessel the Comfort off the coast of Port 
Royal soon. The opposition Jamaica Labor Party [JLP] yesterday 
asked a number of questions about the memorandum of 
understanding between the Government of Jamaica and the United 
States Government establishing a facility to process Haitian 
refugees within the Jamaican territorial waters. JLP chairman 
(Booth Golding) asked whether Haitian nationals found at sea 
outside of the United States waters will be protected by the 
U.S. authorities after ascertaining whether they are in Haitian 
refugee status. He also asked what international law or 
convention governs the [words indistinct]. 
  In a message to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
Dr. 
Paul Robertson, Mr. (Golding) raises 13 qusetions on the 
memorandum of understanding. He asks what is the legal basis for 
the compulsory repatriation of Haitian nationals by United 
States authorities when the port of exit Jamaica. The JLP 
chairman also asked what role the Jamaican authorities have in 
the event of death or injury to any Haitian on board a 
processing facility. On the question of funding, Mr. (Golding) 
asked what recourse is available to the Jamaican Government in 
the event that the United States Government is not able to 
reimburse the Jamaican Government for the directly attributable 
costs incurred in this operation. 
  Yesterday Brigadier General of the U.S. [word indistinct] 
Mike Williams told the Jamaican media that adequate systems were 
in place for the disposal of food and other wastes. He said both 
the Comfort and the [name indistinct], the Ukranian vessel which 
will support the U.S. Naval ship, (?conform with) international 
and environmental regulations. He also allayed the fears of 
those concerned that the docking of the naval ship was the 
beginning of a plan for an invasion of Haiti. The [name 
indistinct] also docked yesterday [words indistinct] one mile 
off Lime Cay.
