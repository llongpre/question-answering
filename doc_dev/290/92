  [Text] A Corporate Area businessman, who allegedly gave two 
prominent young men a quantity of ganja to take to the United 
States, was arrested yesterday and charged with breaches of the 
Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  A police source said Christopher Moore, 23, accompanied by 
his attorney, turned himself in to the police and was arrested 
and charged with possession of ganja, dealing in and taking 
steps to export the drug. 
  Moore, son of Charles Moore who owns Moore's Transport Ltd., 
on Hagley Park Road, St. Andrew, is booked to appear in the 
Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton Street this morning. 

<H5>    A Link </H5>
  Moore's arrest is linked to the arrest Wednesday of Bryan 
Bernal, the 20-year-old son of Jamaica's Ambassador to the 
United States, Dr. Richard Bernal, and a juvenile relative, for 
breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  The young men were held with 45.45 kilograms of ganja 
disguised as pineapple juice as they were being processed to 
leave the Norman Manley International Airport for Washington D.C. 
  However, they contend that they were given the tins, packed 
into two cartons, to deliver to the relative of an acquaintance 
in Washington D.C. The police had been trying to find the person 
who allegedly gave the young men the contraband. 
  In the meantime, the after-dark bail Wednesday of Bryan 
Bernal and a juvenile relative has raised many eyebrows in legal 
circles. 

<H5>    Unprecedented </H5>
  Lawyers say it is unprecedented that persons charged in 
connection with the trafficking of significant amounts of drugs 
be offered "station" bail. 
  Although the police have the power to grant bail, they 
invariably remand persons caught attempting to smuggle drugs and 
allow the court to decide if bail should be granted and in what 
amount. 
  Alleged traffickers, mostly foreigners have consistently 
been 
denied bail in the past, but some Jamaicans whose attorneys have 
been able to convince the court that they will turn up for their 
trial have been offered bail, usually with conditions attached, 
such as surrendering travel documents and reporting to the 
police each week. 
  At Hunt's Bay Police Station Bryan Bernal and the other 
accused were each offered $500,000 bail Wednesday night. 
  They were freed on bail, about 10 hours after they were held 
with the drug packed into 96 tins, labelled pineapple juice, 
among their luggage. 
  When they appeared in the Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton 
Street yesterday, Resident Magistrate Norma Von Cork extended 
their bail until next Thursday, April 14. 
  Their Jamaican passports were seized as a condition of bail. 
  An application by defence counsel Richard Small for the two 
to be given permission to return to the United States to 
continue their studies was turned down by the magistrate. Mr. 
Small submitted that Bryan, an architectural student, was due to 
sit examinations this month. 
  Mr. Small and attorney-in-law Stephen Shelton are appearing 
for the accused. Clerk of the Courts Linda Wright is 
representing the Crown.
