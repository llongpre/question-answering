   Jamaicans will decide Thursday whether
to continue the conservative government of Prime Minister Edward
Seaga or, as the leading pollster predicts, return to Michael
Manley's leftist policies.
   The pollster, Carl Stone, says his surveys forecast a landslide
for Manley, a socialist who led a radical, pro-Cuba government
during the 1970s but has moderated his position. Seaga, a strong
U.S. ally, has been in office since 1980.
   Stone, who is associated with the University of the West Indies,
says the left-of-center People's National Party Manley leads will
win 48 of the 60 seats in Parliament.
   This will be the first contested national election since 1980,
when an estimated 700 people were killed in politically related
violence during a nine-month campaign.
   Manley boycotted the election Seaga called in 1983, in a dispute
over voter registration, leaving Seaga's center-right Jamaica Labor
Party with all 60 seats.
   At least 10 people have died in the current campaign, which is
taking place at the height of the Caribbean island's winter tourist
season and was shortened to just over three weeks.
   Violence has been confined to the Kingston slums and rural towns
far from the big tourist hotels on the north coast.
   Ash Wednesday was a holiday in Jamaica and there was no
campaigning.
   Manley ended his campaign Tuesday night with a plea for peace.
Two shooting deaths were reported earlier in the day.
   ``We cannot build a Jamaica that is worth anything unless we all
begin with a respect for life,'' he told thousands of supporters
gathered at a city square in the capital.
   Seaga's last campaign day was spent in a walking tour of his West
Kingston constituency, where thousands of people lined the streets
to cheer him on. In a radio broadcast that night, he announced plans
to create 200,000 jobs in five years in order to reduce the
unemployment rate from 21 percent to 15.
   He said the Manley government that preceded his had taken Jamaica
``to the brink of collapse'' with ill-conceived economic programs.
   Seaga, 58, was born in Boston and educated at Harvard. He has
presided over a business-oriented government and was the first
official foreign visitor to the Reagan White House in 1981. He was
an outspoken supporter of the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   Manley, 64, attended the London School of Economics and was prime
minister in 1972-1980. He has projected a moderate, pro-U.S. image
in contrast to his former far-left position. Manley said this week
he had ``abandoned all thoughts of nationalization'' and wanted
private business to have a free hand.
   He said he would restore relations with Cuba during his first
year in office, but on a restricted and formal basis. Seaga broke
relations with Fidel Castro's government upon taking office in 1980.
   Jamaicans widely regard Seaga, who seeks an unprecedented third
consecutive term, as a skilled manager who is aloof and autocratic.
Manley, whose father Norman founded the People's National Party, is
a magnetic man seen as a champion of the people but a worry to
business leaders and Jamaica's foreign trading partners.
   Seaga has restored the economy through a rigid program that
emphasized tourism and exports, raised taxes and reduced social
services such as health and education.
   The standard of living of the island's 2.4 million people has
continued to decline, however, and Seaga's popularity has waned.
