   U.S. Customs officials warned Jamaica to intensify
its anti-drug efforts after the agency seized an Air Jamaica
jetliner with nearly two tons of marijuana.
   ``Security procedures on Air Jamaica are dismal at best,''
Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan said Wednesday. ``We hope
(this) seizure will attract their attention.''
   Inspectors found 3,595 pounds of marijuana packed into two
unlisted containers in the cargo hold of the Airbus A-300 that had
flown from Kingston to Miami International Airport, Sheehan said.
   ``You could smell it from 50 feet away,'' he said. ``We just
cannot comprehend how the Jamaicans could not have discovered it,
and allowed it to leave the country.''
   Under U.S. law, the plane was seized and government-owned Air
Jamaica could be liable for a fine of $28.7 million. Impounded
aircraft usually are released after payment of a small percentage
of the penalty.
   Larger marijuana shipments have been intercepted on ships and
cargo planes, but Tuesday's seizure was the most within memory
aboard a scheduled commercial airliner, Sheehan said.
   As customs officials Wednesday were announcing that find, three
men carrying shoulder bags with a total of 60 pounds of pot were
nabbed on another Air Jamaica flight here, Sheehan said.
   George Heavey, customs regional director, said the plane seizure
marked the 130th time since 1980 that shipments were stopped on Air
Jamaica flights. Agents have intercepted a total of almost 9 tons
of the drug.
   ``Customs is very concerned that _ despite the rhetoric and the
propaganda that we've been receiving from Air Jamaica _ the
security is almost totally ineffective,'' Heavey said. ``We've got
to do more to stop the use of Air Jamaica aircraft as conveyances
to smuggle marijuana.''
   He said theency was particularly incensed that the two large
cargo containers were not not on the flight manifest.
   Inside the containers, agents found 88 cardboard boxes,
including 29 filled with clothes and the rest stuffed with
marijuana.
   Inspectors did not immediately grab the drug,owing it to be
picked up at the airport.
   They then followed a rental truck carrying the pot to south
Miami, stopping it and arresting the driver, William H. Muller of
Miami, after he appeared to be taking evasive maneuvers,
authorities said
