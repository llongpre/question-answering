   Jamaica expects to raise $300 million through the sale of 13 of the Caribbean island's hotels, said Oliver F. Clarke, chairman of a government unit in charge of the sales. 

   The sale of the hotels is a large part of the Jamaican government's program to denationalize state assets. 

   Tourism is one of Jamaica's most successful industries, and its largest source of foreign exchange, Mr. Clarke said, adding he already has been beseiged by commercial banks that are eager to swap debt owed them by the Jamaican government for equity investments in the country's hotels. 

   But this isn't what Jamaica wants. 
"Debt-equity isn't really the name of the game here," said Mr. Clarke, chairman of the hotel divestment unit of National Hotels &amp; Properties Ltd. 
The country seeks new investors, who will have to respect leases outstanding on these hotels, he said. 
Mr. Clarke said he was in New York to talk to prospective buyers and to possible investment bank advisers for the sale of the hotels.
