<LEADPARA>  IMPENETRABLE ice prevented the Frontier Spirit from completing an eastbound
voyage through the Arctic Ocean by way of the so-called Northwest Passage. The
ship, chartered by Salen Lindblad Cruising, had to turn back earlier this
month at Point Barrow, 1,000 miles from Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians, where
the voyage began. The ship, rated super ice class, carried 126 passengers.;  
This year there was more ice on the route than ever before, a spokeswoman for
Salen Lindblad said. "Even a Canadian icebreaker could not get through," she
added.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Travelers' Advisory  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The Frontier Spirit, which has a capacity of 164, sailed for Vancouver
instead of St. John's, Newfoundland. As a result, two East Coast cruises
planned by Salen Lindblad were canceled. Passengers on the aborted Northwest
Passage voyage were given refunds of 50 percent of the cruise fare, return air
fare (not normally included) and credits toward future sailings. Those
scheduled to take cruises out of Newfoundland were given full refunds.;   Lars
Wikander, president of Salen Lind-blad, said the company would attempt the
Northwest Passage again next year.; VIENNA, AUSTRIA; (box) The Austrian
Theater Museum, with a collection of 1.4 million items, will open in the
renovated Lobkowitz Palace in Vienna on Oct. 26. The palace, at 2
Lobkowitzplatz in the city's old quarter, is two blocks behind the State Opera
House.;   On display in the new museum will be costumes, stage props,
programs, posters, recordings and set designs. There will be a survey of
Austria's theatrical history, and a section that uses models and computer
games to introduce youngsters to drama and comedy. One of the first special
displays will be dedicated to Max Reinhardt, the Austrian theatrical producer
who founded the Salzburg Festival and directed movies in Hollywood.;   The
Austrian Theater Museum was started in 1922 when several private collections
were combined, but until now it has never had a home spacious enough to set up
permanent displays. Lobkowitz Palace, built between 1685 and 1687, is one of
the finest examples of Baroque architecture in Vienna. The museum will be open
from Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with admission of $3.50.; MEXICO;
(box) A State Department travel advisory warning Americans to exercise caution
when visiting Mexico, because of bombings in Mexico City, has been canceled.
The advisory, issued Aug. 21, cited bombings in mid-August at a Citibank
building, an IBM office building, a Sanborn's restaurant and a McDonald's. No
injuries and only minor damage was reported, and the advisory noted that the
attacks were believed to have been directed at "high-profile physical
locations and not at individuals.";   In canceling the advisory on Sept. 6,
the State Department said it had "conducted an ongoing review of the situation
in Mexico, and has determined these incidents no longer warrant a caution to
American citizens traveling or residing in Mexico."; GREAT BRITAIN; (box)
British Airways will increase its capacity by 15 percent on trans-Atlantic
service to Heathrow Airport outside London next year with the introduction of
twice-daily departures from Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, Miami and
Chicago.;   The expansion program is part of a long-range goal to provide two
round trips a day from all 18 American cities from which it flies. Kennedy
International Airport in New York is now the only gateway with more than one
flight a day: it has six on weekdays, seven on weekend days, including
Concorde service.;   The airline will begin twice-daily Los Angeles to
Heathrow service on Oct. 27, though the airline is dropping a daily flight
from Gatwick. The expanded Miami service begins March 29; Washington and
Chicago, May 1, and Boston, June 1. British Airways also operates three
Concorde flights a week to London from Dulles International Airport, outside
Washington.; JAMAICA; (box) Jamaican officials say security is being
heightened in tourist areas island-wide "to ensure more protection for
visitors and to reassure U.S. citizens that Jamaica offers a safe and
satisfying vacation experience.";   The announcement came in response to a
State Department travel notice warning that "The level of crime in Kingston .
. . is a serious problem . . . and exceeds the level of criminal activity
elsewhere in the Caribbean . . . Visitors should not walk around at night" and
"should avoid public transportation."; FALLING LEAVES; (box) Heading back east
