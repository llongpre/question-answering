Two US ships on which Haitians will be questioned about their requests for
asylum in the US were anchored just outside the harbour of the Jamaican
capital at the weekend.
But there is still no indication when the operation will begin.
US officials say that Haitians fleeing their country for the US will still
be returned home.
The USS Comfort, a thousand-bed hospital ship, and the Gruziya, a chartered
Ukrainian cruise ship, will be the first processing centres off Jamaica,
under the new US policy to give Haitians seeking asylum a hearing to
determine the validity of their claims.
There is no definite date for starting the migrant processing centre, said
Brig-Gen Michael Williams who is heading the operation. 'Until such time
that all arrangements have been completed, the US will continue to
repatriate all Haitians interdicted at sea and encourage Haitians to go to
one of three processing centres already in Haiti as the safest way to
process their claim to refugee status,' he added.
When the operation begins, Haitians intercepted at sea will be taken to the
Comfort, two miles outside the entrance of Kingston harbour, where they will
be medically tested and photographed.
After questioning, Haitians not accepted as refugees will be returned to
Haiti. Those 'determined to have a legitimate status as refugees' will be
sent to Kingston airport, flown to the US naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba,
and then taken to the US, Brig-Gen Williams said.
The use of the ships to process Haitians' claims followed criticism of the
US policy of returning all Haitians intercepted at sea. The volume of
Haitian boatpeople heading for Florida has grown since the overthrow and
exile of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's elected president, in 1991.
