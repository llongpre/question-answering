   Two more people were killed in political
violence in central Kingston, raising to 10 the number of deaths
linked to this week's general elections, police said today.
   Details of the killings were sketchy, but according to a
spokeswoman for Prime Minister Edward Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party,
one of the deaths occurred when a gunman attacked a group of Seaga
supporters Tuesday evening and he was shot by pursuing police.
   About a half-hour later, a Seaga supporter was shot nearby, said
the party official, who asked not to be identified by name.
   Police said the two killings were related to politics surrounding
Thursday's election, but would not say which parties were involved.
   At a rally in Kingston late Tuesday, Michael Manley, Seaga's
opponent in the election, closed his campaign with a plea for peace.
   ``We cannot build a Jamaica that is worth anything unless we
begin with a respect for life,'' he told several thousand supporters.
   Manley said one of those killed Tuesday was a boy who was ``shot
for no reason.'' He said the other was a gunman, but did not
identify the man's party.
   Thursday's are Jamaica's first national elections since 1980,
when an estimated 700 people died in political violence over an
nine-month campaign. The current campaign opened Jan. 15 and has not
generated anything comparable to the 1980 mayhem.
   The violence has been confined mainly to the capital's slums and
rural districts far removed from the major tourist hotels on the
north coast.
   Manley, who served as prime minister from 1972 to 1980, is
favored in opinion polls to defeat the conservative Seaga, who has
been one of the closest U.S. allies in the Caribbean.
