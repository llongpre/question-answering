   Procter &amp; Gamble lost at least $300
million because Kimberly-Clark copied the design of its
super-absorbent diapers, an attorney said Wednesday in final
arguments in a federal lawsuit over Pampers and Huggies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble forecast it would make that much money annually
from its super-absorbent Pampers, said attorney Allen Gerstein, who
was representing the soap, toiletries and disposable diaper giant.
   But sales were $150 million below projections in each of fiscal
years 1986-87 and 1987-88 after Kimberly-Clark violated the Pampers
patent and introduced super-absorbent Huggies, Gerstein told U.S.
District Judge Falcon Hawkins.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble wants Hawkins to order
Kimberly-Clark to stop manufacturing super-absorbent Huggies and to
remove them from store shelves. The company also is seeking
unspecified money damages.
   About $3.3 billion worth of disposable diapers are sold each
year, according to industry officials. Procter &amp; Gamble is the
industry leader with about 47 percent of the market while
Kimberly-Clark is No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   Hawkins is expected to rule in the non-jury case sometime this
summer. If he decides Kimberly-Clark is liable, damages will be
determined in a separate proceeding.
   Twenty-three witnesses testified and about 4,100 exhibits were
introduced during 17 days of testimony in the trial that began last
month.
   Procter &amp; Gamble contends that researchers Paul Weisman and
Steve Goldman developed a way to combine wood pulp fluff and super
absorbent materials in diapers to allow them to be made thinner.
   The company has argued that Kimberly-Clark violated its patent
on the process when it later introduced its super-absorbent Huggies.
   But Kimberly-Clark says Procter &amp; Gamble never had a valid
patent because it provided misleading information to the U.S.
Patent Office.
   Patent attorney V. Bryan Medlock Jr., representing
Kimberly-Clark, testified that if the patent office's examining
officer had known about earlier work on a similar process by an
Italian inventor, the patent would never have been issued to
Procter &amp; Gamble.
   In his closing arguments, Medlock said, ``Kimberly-Clark
totally, independently developed its Huggies super-trim diapers.''
   The super absorbent material in Procter &amp; Gamble's test-marketed
diapers did not work well, Medlock said, and they leaked.
   Procter &amp; Gamble addressed the problem in later versions of its
diaper products that included concentrating areas of super
absorbers and manufacturing double-layered diapers.
   The trial is being held here because Kimberly-Clark has a a
diaper manufacturing plant at Beech Island, near the Georgia border.
