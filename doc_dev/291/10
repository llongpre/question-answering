<LEADPARA>  Two industry giants are raising a big stink in court over who invented a
leak-control flap on disposable diapers.;    The patent-infringement case pits
Kimberly-Clark Corp., the Dallas-based maker of Huggies, against Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. of Cincinnati, whose Pampers and Luvs brand diapers dominate the
disposable diaper market.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  JUDGE HEARS BIG FLAP OVER DIAPER FLAPS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Kimberly-Clark, which filed suit two years ago, alleges that Procter &amp;
Gamble copied its invention of a leak-shield flap in violation of federal
patent laws.;    Procter &amp; Gamble contends that it not only invented the
leak-control shield, but that the flaps in Pampers are substantially different
from the Huggies version.;    The non-jury trial began Tuesday before U.S.
District Judge William Dwyer.;    Leak-control shields are a critical
component of the fiercely competitive $4.2 billion disposable diaper business.
A 1989 study found that in a 2 1/2-year period, the average baby will have 325
urine leaks and 200 bowel-movement leaks.;    Procter &amp; Gamble first
test-marketed Pampers with leak-control shields during three months in late
1988 and early 1989.;    Kimberly-Clark filed suit in April 1989, when it
began selling Huggies with leak-control shields.  </TEXT>
