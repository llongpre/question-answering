   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. is testing colored
diapers _ blue for boys, pink for girls _ in several states to see
if pastels catch on for baby's bottoms.
   The diapers, which bear the Luvs Deluxe brand name, also include
extra padding in the front for boys' diapers and in the middle for
the girls' version.
   The padding is part of a patented system aimed at better
absorption, P&amp;G spokeswoman Carol Boyd said Wednesday. ``The
padding is just placed a little differently,'' she said.
   The diapers are being made available in Kansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Arkansas, and Evansville, Ind., as part of a market test,
Ms. Boyd said. P&amp;G will see how well they're accepted before
deciding whether to market them across the country.
   ``It's too soon to know whether or not these diapers will be
available nationally,'' she said. ``Consumers ultimately will be
the ones to judge.''
   Parents' comments prompted P&amp;G to offer the colored diapers, Ms.
Boyd said, adding that it's the first time the company has
attempted such an experment. ``Parents are the ones who told us
that they liked that. It was a fashion decision,'' she said.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble has been locked in a tight
competition with Kimberly-Clark for the lead in disposable diaper
sales. P&amp;G held two-thirds of the $3 billion U.S. retail market at
the start of the decade, but its Pampers brand slipped behind
Kimberly-Clark's Huggies in 1985. Good sales by the Luvs brand
helped P&amp;G maintain the overall lead.
   P&amp;G recaptured 60 percent of the market by 1986 with aggressive
marketing and product changes.
   P&amp;G lost a legal battle with Kimberly-Clark last year when a
jury in Dallas ruled that the elasticized waistband in Huggies
disposables was not a patent infringement. P&amp;G had asked for an
injunction to stop Kimberly-Clark from making elasticized Huggies,
saying the diapers violated P&amp;G's patent for heat-shrinkable
material used in the Huggies waistbands.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had overall sales of $17 billion in fiscal
1986-87. It makes and markets laundry and cleaning products,
personal care products, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage
products, and other items for business and industry.
