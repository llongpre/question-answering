   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. proposes to paper
posteriors with pastel Pampers.
   The consumer products company said Wednesday it plans to
market-test blue disposable diapers for boys and pink ones for
girls in several states to see if parents prefer the colored
versions on their children.
   The diapers, which actually will bear the Luvs Deluxe brand
name, include extra padding in the front for boys diapers and in
the middle for the girls version, as part of a patented system
aimed at better absorption, P&amp;G spokeswoman Carol Boyd said
Wednesday.
   The idea to add color came from parents' suggestions to the
company.
   ``It was a fashion decision,'' she said. ``Parents told us
that's what they wanted.''
   Ms. Boyd said she believed at least one other company has tried
colored diapers, but this was the first time for Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The diapers will be market tested in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri,
Arkansas and Evansville, Ind., before the company decides whether
to sell them nationally, Ms. Boyd said.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble is fighting Kimberly-Clark
Corp., of Dallas, for the lead in disposable diaper sales. P&amp;G held
two-thirds of the $3 billion U.S. retail market at the start of the
decade, but its Pampers brand slipped behind Kimberly-Clark's
Huggies in 1985. Good sales by the Luvs brand helped P&amp;G maintain
the overall lead.
   P&amp;G had recaptured 60 percent of the market by 1986 with
aggressive marketing and product changes.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had overall sales of $17 billion in fiscal
1986-87. It makes and markets laundry and cleaning products,
personal care products, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage
products, and other items for business and industry.
