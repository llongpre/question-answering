   Until his infant daughter developed a stubborn case of diaper rash last winter, Edward Reiss was happily semiretired, running his little Sedona, Ariz., company making shoe polish and shoehorns. 

   Through a catalog, his wife bought some little-known, chemical-free, super-dry disposable diapers. 
They seemed so effective that in April Mr. Reiss, 50 years old, bought a 30% stake in the tiny Denver company that makes the diapers, Rocky Mountain Medical Corp. 
Since then, Mr. Reiss has expanded Rocky Mountain's distribution, licensed the Uncle Wiggly storybook character to use in marketing the diapers and, last week, announced that the company will begin making the nation's first biodegradable diaper, using a special plastic that should break down within two to five years. 

   Can the man who claims to have built the nation's largest maker of shoehorns squeeze into the $3 billion disposable diaper market dominated by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp.? 
Probably not. 
"But do they have to? 
No, it's a niche market," says a broker who makes a market in Rocky Mountain's stock. 

   If all goes as planned, the new diaper, marketed under the name TenderCare, will appeal to parents who worry about the chemical processes used in popular disposable diapers, and Rocky Mountain, which had a loss of $10,000 on revenue of $387,000 in the nine months ended June 30, will be a much larger company. 

   The diaper kingpins, of course, contend their products already suit even the tenderest infant bottoms. 
And Kimberly-Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble, which together control about 80% of the disposable diaper business, say the super-absorbent material that turns wetness into gel in Huggies, Pampers and Luvs hasn't been found to cause any significant health problems. 
Kimberly-Clark also makes thicker diapers without the gelling material. 

   Both big makers are skeptical about Rocky Mountain's claim that its diaper is biodegradable. 
Both would like to have fully biodegradable diapers, to ease environmental concerns about mountains of waste plastic. 
But they have searched in vain for a truly biodegradable product so far; their diapers are 60% to 70% biodegradable, they estimate. 
"When an effective material is found, we'll certainly use it," says a Kimberly-Clark spokeswoman. 

   Mr. Reiss says the new diaper is 99.4% biodegradable. 
He won't divulge the exact process it will use, although he says the plastic covering includes an additive that makes it break down. 
A Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman says the company knows of a plastic using a starch additive that breaks the plastic into pieces, but says the plastic doesn't truly disintegrate. 

   To carry out his niche strategy, Mr. Reiss expects to begin marketing the biodegradable diaper in December through representatives of Medela Inc., which leases infant-care products, and through health-food stores and some specialty baby-product outlets. 
Rocky Mountain, which also makes some infant medical products, plans to stay away from the competitive grocery and mass merchandise outlets, but hopes to persuade some department stores to stock the product. 

   Meanwhile, the diapers will continue to be sold through mail-order and catalogs for $59, including delivery, for four packages. 
Four of the big competitors' packages (128 to 264 small, medium or large diapers) typically retail for about $40. 

   Mr. Reiss is unfazed by the challenge of grabbing his share of the 15.8 billion disposable diapers sold each year. 
His shoehorn company had $80,000 in sales when he bought it in 1976. 
Its revenue has quintupled and it now sells six million promotional shoehorns a year. 
"I think I can sell just as many diapers as I can shoehorns," he says.
