   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it had
reached a $125 million agreement with three competitors whom the
company had charged with violating its patent for crisp and chewy
cookies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said Keebler Co., Nabisco Brands Inc. and
Frito-Lay Inc. agreed to a consent judgment signed by U.S. District
Judge Joseph Longobardi in Wilmington, Del., where Procter &amp; Gamble
filed its lawsuits.
   ``We've worked hard to prove we're right, and we won,'' said John
E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble. ``We believe this judgment
is a complete vindication of our rights under this patent.''
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble markets the cookies under the
name Duncan Hines.
   The company filed lawsuits against Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay
in June 1984. The settlement averted a trial that was scheduled to
begin Oct. 2.
   The agreement states that Procter &amp; Gamble's patent is valid and
enforceable and it prohibits the three companies from infringing the
patent, Procter &amp; Gamble said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble spokesman Donald Tassone refused to say how much
each of the three companies would pay Procter &amp; Gamble. He said the
settlement requires that the companies not divulge its terms
publicly.
   Frito-Lay, based in Plano, Texas, said it would pay less than $20
million as its share of the settlement. Frito-Lay described the
settlement as a ``prudent business decision that allowed the company
to avoid a complex, lengthy and costly trial.''
   Frito-Lay, which is owned by Pepsico Inc., said the settlement
would be paid by insurance and would have no effect on the company's
finances.
   Comment from Keebler, which is a subsidiary of United Biscuits
PLC of Britain, and Nabisco, part of RJR Nabisco Inc., was not
immediately available.
   Procter &amp; Gamble introduced its cookies in 1983. Keebler, Nabisco
and Frito-Lay later introduced this same type of cookie, Procter &amp;
Gamble said.
   The three companies altered the composition of their cookies
after Procter &amp; Gamble sued, Tassone said. They no longer sell
cookies that Procter &amp; Gamble regards as violating its patent, he
said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said the gain from the settlement would be
reflected in its first-quarter earnings.
