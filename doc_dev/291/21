<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Earnings Up; Kimberly-Clark's Also</HEAD>

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Tuesday reported a 17.9 percent increase in
earnings for the January to March quarter and another big consumer
products company, Kimberly-Clark Corp., said its quarterly income
went up 10.5 percent.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said its after-tax
earnings rose to $310 million, or $1.85 a share, in the three
months ended March 31, up from $263 million, or $1.53 a share, a
year earlier.
   Sales rose to $5.43 billion in the January-March period, the
third quarter in the company's fiscal year, up 11.7 percent from
$4.86 billion a year earlier.
   The company credited higher selling prices, greater sales
volumes and currency translation adjustments as reasons for its
profit growth. These factors were partially offset by a higher
estimated tax rate.
   For the first nine months of Procter &amp; Gamble's fiscal year, net
income came to $1.04 billion, or $6.13 a share, on sales of $15.97
billion. In the corresponding period the year before, earnings were
$880 million, or $5.14 a share, and sales totaled $14.36 billion.
   The company manufactures and markets a wide range of laundry and
cleaning products, personal care products, foods and beverages,
plus a variety of items used by businesses and industry.
   In a release from Kimberly-Clark's Dallas office, the company
said its first quarter income increased to $103.1 million, or $1.28
share, from $93.3 million, or $1.16 a share, in 1988's first
quarter.
   Sales amounted to $1.42 billion, a 9.9 percent pickup from the
comparable 1988 quarter, in which sales totaled $1.29 billion.
   Net income improved because of increased earnings from equity
companies and lower interest expense, Darwin E. Smith, chairman and
chief executive, said in a statement.
   About 60 percent of the sales improvement in the quarter can be
attributed to increased sales volumes, which were achieved in most
major businesses, Smith said. Volume increases were led by consumer
tissue, feminine care and disposable diaper businesses in the
United States and Canada.
   Operating profit, however, dropped 4.9 percent to $171.7 million
from $180.5 million.
   Kimberly-Clark attributed the drop in operating profit to higher
marketing expenses because of intense competition. It also cited
weakening newsprint markets, higher fiber costs worldwide and
expenses associated with new products, particularly Huggies
Pull-Ups training pants.
   Kimberly-Clark is a manufacturer of household, personal care and
health care products, including Kleenex tissues, and newsprint and
business, correspondence and specialty papers.
