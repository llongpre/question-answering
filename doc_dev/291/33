   Three major cookie manufacturers have
been ordered to pay Procter &amp; Gamble Co. $125 million to settle a
5-year-old patent infringement case.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Joseph J. Longobardi signed a consent
judgment Tuesday, saying Keebler Co. of Elmhurst, Ill., Nabisco
Brands Inc. of East Hanover, N.J., and Frito-Lay Inc. of Dallas,
infringed on Procter &amp; Gamble's patent for homestyle cookies
marketed under the Duncan Hines label.
   The case was scheduled to go to trial in October, but an
agreement among the companies was reached late Monday that says
Procter &amp; Gamble's patents are valid and enforceable, according to
Donald P. Tassone, spokesman for the Cincinnati-based company.
   Keebler is to pay $52.9 million for the Soft Batch cookie it
introduced in 1984; Nabisco will pay $52.9 million for its Almost
Home Brand; and Frito-Lay will pay $19.1 million for its Grandmas
Rich and Chewy product.
   Once the lawsuit was filed, the formulas for the three products
were changed.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said after it test-marketed its soft cookie in
January 1983, the three competitors pirated the formula and beat it
to the market.
   The company sued the three in 1984.
   The competitors countered that the patent was not valid.
   ``It was very frustrating to see our competitors, who were
already in the cookie business, beating us to market in most of the
country with the very product we had developed and patented,'' said
John E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The cookie brand never reached its projected market share,
Tassone said.
   ``The settlement will help, but it will not make up for what we
lost,'' he said.
   Nabisco said it was ``delighted the protracted legal battle was
settled and that the settlement will not hurt parent RJR Nabisco's
earnings.
   Frito-Lay said the settlement will be paid by insurance and will
have no effect on the earnings of its parent company, PepsiCo Inc.
   Stuart L. Greenblatt, spokesman for Keebler, said homestyle
cookies have not been the market blockbuster that was originally
anticipated.
   The cookies' market share began declining ``almost as soon as
they were introduced,'' said Manfredi.
   ``The cookies didn't turn out to be the bonanza expected,'' said
James F. Burnett of Potter, Anderson &amp; Corroon, which represented
Frito-Lay.
