   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Monday it is merging
its paper products businesses in Italy, Spain, Portugal and the
United Kingdom with those of the Fater group of companies.
   The companies declined to reveal terms of the agreement. The
Fater companies are a privately held group based in Pescara, Italy.
   Procter &amp; Gamble and Fater said the joint effort assures their
future within the increasingly competitive European market. The
joint venture also accelerates P&amp;G's entry into the European market
for feminine sanitary napkin and adult incontinence products,
because of Fater's success in those markets, P&amp;G officials said.
   Under the agreement, a new company will be formed in Italy under
dual control. This company will include the present Fater
businesses making and selling sanitary napkins, disposable baby
diapers and adult incontinence products; the Fameccanica machinery
company; the Faricerca, Faidata and Fatecnica research companies,
and P&amp;G's Pampers baby diaper business.
   In Spain and Portugal, Ausonia and Lepori businesses will be
combined with the Arbora company, which Procter &amp; Gamble jointly
controls with the Agrolimen group. In the United Kingdom, the
Swaddlers company will be integrated within P&amp;G.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, had $24 billion in
worldwide sales for the fiscal year ended June 30.
