   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it is
forming a joint venture to do business in Venezuela with a
Venezuelan manufacturer of disposable diapers and other infant care
products.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said the joint venture with Industrias Mammi,
C.A., of Caracas, Venezuela, is subject to approval by the
Venezuelan government. P&amp;G, a Cincinnati-based company which makes
and sells food and personal-care products worldwide, declined to
reveal terms of the agreement.
   Mammi makes and markets disposable diapers, other baby care
items and feminine protection products. It employs about 500 people
and owns and operates a manufacturing facility near Caracas.
   Procter &amp; Gamble de Venezuela, C.A., is based in Caracas and has
operated since 1950. It has plants in Caracas and Barquisimeto that
together employ about 1,000 people. P&amp;G's Venezuelan subsidiary
makes and sells detergent, bar soap, toothpaste, dishwashing liquid
and shampoo products.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had worldwide sales of $19.3 billion in fiscal
1987-88. About one-third of that total was overseas sales. The
company sells products in more than 140 countries.
