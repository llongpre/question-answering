   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it had
sued a southeast Kansas couple for allegedly spreading rumors _
which it has denied for years _ that the company was associated
with satanism.
   The suit filed late Monday in U.S. District Court, alleges that
James and Linda Newton of Parsons have made libelous and malicious
statements about Procter &amp; Gamble by saying it supports ``the
church of Satan.''
   The couple also allegedly urged people to boycott Procter &amp;
Gamble products.
   A company news release said the Newtons are distributors of
household items for rival Amway Home Products, ``as were several
individuals who previously admitted spreading these lies.''
   ``It appears they are trying to enhance their own business,''
said Topeka attorney Edwin Smith, representing Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The company is seeking more than $50,000 in damages, and is
asking the court to order the Newtons to stop circulating the
stories.
   Mrs. Newton, reached at her home, declined to comment.
   The suit is one of a number the Cincinnati-based company has
filed over the years in an attempt to fight persistent rumors that
its ``moon and stars'' trademark is a satanic symbol.
   The 108-year-old trademark features a man-in-the-moon figure, a
popular design of the 1800s, overlooking a field of 13 stars the
company says are to honor the original American colonies.
   ``We're very proud of our company trademark symbolizing Procter
&amp; Gamble quality and excellence,'' Edwin L. Artzt, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a news release.
   ``These lies have persisted now for 10 years, and we will file
further suits if necessary,'' he said.
   The suit alleges that in a circular, the Newtons said the moon
and stars trademark is a satanic symbol. They said the symbol is
actually a ``tiny ram's horn with three sets of stars placed in
such a way that if the stars in each set are joined they form the
number 666, known as the devil's number.''
   ``Christians should always remember that if they buy any product
with this symbol they will be taking part in the support of the
Church of Satan,'' according to the flyer, which was included in
the suit as an exhibit.
   The suit also alleges the Newtons have falsely told people that
senior Procter &amp; Gamble officials have appeared on nationally
televised talk shows acknowledging the company's ties to satanism.
   Over the past three months, the company has received 300 to 350
calls a day asking about the allegations, primarily from
southeastern United States, company officials said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble products include Pampers disposable diapers,
Crest toothpaste, Scope mouthwash, Ivory soap, Tide laundry
detergent, Folgers coffee and Head and Shoulders shampoo.
   In 1985, the company filed lawsuits in Lynchburg, Va., Scranton,
Pa., and Wichita, Kan., against people it accused of spreading
similar rumors associated the company with Satan.
   Procter &amp; Gamble also at the time began phasing out the use of
the trademark on company products, hired private investigators to
probe the spread of the rumors and established a national toll-free
telephone line to handle inquiries.
