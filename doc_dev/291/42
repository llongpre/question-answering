   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. claimed a victory today in
a legal fight with three competitors in the cookie business,
announcing that the companies have agreed to pay P&amp;G $125 million
for violating its patent on crisp and chewy cookies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said Keebler Co., Nabisco Brands Inc. and
Frito-Lay Inc. have agreed to pay P&amp;G a total of $125 million, which
will be reflected as part of P&amp;G's first-quarter earnings for fiscal
1988-89.
   The three companies agreed to a consent judgment signed by U.S.
District Judge Joseph Longobardi in Wilmington, Del., where P&amp;G had
filed its lawsuits, the company announced today.
   The Cincinnati-based P&amp;G markets its crisp and chewy cookies
under the name Duncan Hines. The company filed separate lawsuits
against Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay in June 1984. The lawsuits
were consolidated for court handling and had been scheduled to go to
trial Oct. 2.
   The settlement averts the need for trial and allows the companies
to avoid trial costs.
   The agreement states that P&amp;G's patent is valid and enforceable.
The agreement prevents the three companies from infringing P&amp;G's
patent in the future, P&amp;G officials said.
   P&amp;G spokesman Donald Tassone refused today to say how much each
of the three companies would be paying P&amp;G individually. He said the
settlement agreement requires that the companies not divulge its
terms publicly.
   P&amp;G introduced its ready-to-eat, crisp and chewy cookies in 1983.
Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay later introduced this same type of
cookie, P&amp;G said. Keebler is a subsidiary of United Biscuits PLC of
Britain, Nabisco is part of RJR Nabisco Inc. and Frito-Lay is owned
by PepsiCo Inc.
   The three companies altered the composition of their cookies
after P&amp;G sued, Tassone said. They no longer sell cookies that P&amp;G
regards as violating its patent, he said.
   ``We've worked hard to prove we're right, and we won,'' said John
E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble. ``We believe this judgment
is a complete vindication of our rights under this patent.''
