SMALL O.C. FIRM HOPES BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT SUCCESSFUL IN SOUTHLAND MARKET

<P>
If a small Orange County firm has its way, the $3-billion disposable diaper 
industry is in for a change. 
</P>
<P>
This week Vons' 350 stores in California and Nevada began carrying throwaway 
diapers that the manufacturer, American Enviro Products Inc. of Placentia, says 
are almost entirely biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
The move marks the first big breakthrough in Southern California by American 
Enviro, which has been selling the Bunnies diapers mostly in the Southeast 
United States since July. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between American Enviro's diapers and conventional disposable 
models, according to the manufacturer, is that the regular diapers take up to 
200 years to break down. American Enviro has developed a product that can 
dissolve within 1 1/2 to 2 years, said company President Robert Chickering. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the size of the diaper, American Enviro's products are 85-92% 
biodegradable, Chickering said Tuesday. "Our goal is to make a product that's 
100% biodegradable," he added. 
</P>
<P>
American Enviro is not the first to come up a diaper using plastic that quickly 
rots. At least two other firms already market biodegradable diapers, which are 
supposed to decompose quickly through natural processes once they are 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
If the manufacturers are right, they could be going a long way toward solving a 
big solid-waste problem. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of babies in the United States wear disposable diapers, totaling up 
to 18 billion discarded diapers each year -- which account for as much as 2% of 
U.S. landfill use. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that the plastic-and-paper diapers do not decompose 
once they are thrown away. Instead, they become a potential source of viruses 
and bacteria that cause infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
The biodegradable diapers use plastics mixed with cornstarch that allow 
microorganisms to attack the plastic once it is in the soil, Chickering said. 
There are also enhancers in the plastic that allow the plastic to break down 
even in landfills, where the lack of air and moisture makes decomposition 
virtually impossible, according to Chickering. A biodegradable absorbency 
powder also is used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The technology has been available for 10 years. What has happened in the past 
two years, Chickering said, is that it has become practical and cheap enough to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Bunnies diapers retail for about $9.99 for 32 to 60 diapers, 
depending on the size. (Vons, which sells all baby products at wholesale costs, 
is selling them for $9.40 per package.) Conventional disposable diapers retail 
for $9.99 to $10.25. 
</P>
<P>
Since American Enviro began shipping Bunnies in July, about 7.5 million have 
been sold at retail outlets including Longs Drugs, Target stores and Lucky 
Stores Inc.'s Northern California supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, Chickering estimates the 9-month-old, privately held 
company will have sold 65 million to 75 million diapers. The products are 
manufactured under contract in Porterville, Calif., Eau Claire, Wis., and 
Indianopolis. The firm employs five people at its Placentia offices. 
</P>
<P>
The disposable diaper market is dominated by Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. and 
Kimberly-Clark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Cincinnati-based Proctor &amp; Gamble, the largest disposable 
diaper maker, sells $1.65 billion worth of Pampers and Luvs annually. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both major manufacturers have said that their diapers are as 
biodegradable as any on the market. Both are skeptical about claims by the 
biodegradable makers. 
</P>
<P>
But American Enviro and some retailers are unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned as a grocery company about the environment and want to 
offer an environmentally friendly product," said Mike Roberts, grocery buyer 
for El Monte-based Vons Cos. "We have documentation from (American Enviro) and 
their test results. . . . We want to be the first (supermarket) to offer a 
biodegradable product."
