<HEAD>P&amp;G Reports $140 Million in 4th Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Wednesday it posted
earnings of $140 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a
loss in the same period a year earlier.
   The consumer products company said its earnings translated to 82
cents per share for the quarter ended June 30 and compared with a
loss of $324 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   The prior-year loss was attributed to an after-tax restructuring
charge of $459 million. Without the charge, Procter &amp; Gamble's
fourth-quarter earnings would have risen 3.7 percent.
   The company said its fourth-quarter sales rose to $4.97 billion
from $4.17 billion.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it benefited from increased sales overseas
and a lower tax rate.
   The Cincinnati-based company makes and sells a variety of food,
household and personal-care products, including Pampers diapers,
Tide detergent, Folger's coffee, Vicks cough medicine and Ivory
soap.
   For the full fiscal year, Procter &amp; Gamble said it earned $1.02
billion, or $5.96 per share, up more than 200 percent from $327
million, or $4.59 per share, in the previous year.
   Without the prior year charge, the company's full-year earnings
would have risen nearly 30 percent.
   Full-year sales totaled $19.34 billion, up from $17 billion.
