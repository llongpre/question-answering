Marketing Deal Scrapped: Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. 
said they are canceling a marketing agreement that the Justice Department 
challenged on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would have given Cincinnati-based P&amp;G, which makes the 
Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy, exclusive rights to sell Ft. Washington, Pa.-based 
Rorer's Maalox antacid. On Aug. 7, the department said it would challenge the 
deal on grounds that it would reduce competition and raise prices in the 
stomach remedy market.
