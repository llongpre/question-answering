   A battle between industry giants over
super-absorbent diapers _ and the millions of dollars that come
through their sale _ has opened in U.S. District Court here.
   In the case, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. charges that the design of its
highly successful super-absorbent Pampers was copied by
Kimberly-Clark Corp. in developing super-absorbent Huggies.
   The huge consumer products company wants U.S. District Judge
Falcon Hawkins to order Kimberly-Clark to stop manufacturing the
Huggies and remove them from store shelves. The company also is
seeking unspecified monetary damages.
   The stakes are high, for making disposable diapers is a $3.3
billion-a-year business, according to court records.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, is the industry leader,
with 47 percent of the market. Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark is No. 2
with about 30 percent, industry analysts say.
   As the trial got under way Monday, attorneys crowded the
courtroom while scattered along the jury box were boxes and bags of
diapers. The case is expected to last at least three weeks.
   Allen Gerstein, representing Procter &amp; Gamble, said P&amp;G came up
with the idea that made super absorbent diapers possible and took
out a patent on the development.
   The breakthrough, he said, allowed the manufacture of diapers
that are generally thinner but more absorbent than regular, more
bulky disposables.
   ``We stayed within the system while Kimberly-Clark disregarded
and took unfair advantage of the system,'' he told Hawkins in his
opening argument.
   P&amp;G Researcher Paul Weisman developed a means for combining wood
pulp fluff and super absorbent materials in the diaper to allow it
to be made thinner, Gerstein said.
   Gerstein said Kimberly-Clark copied the idea shortly after the
Pampers were test marketed in Wichita, Kan., in 1984.
   The introduction of the new diapers ``turned the diaper world on
its ear,'' he said.
   But attorney H. Blair White, representing Kimberly-Clark, said,
``This case is about two fiercely competitive companies each trying
to improve baby diapers.''
   He charged that P&amp;G never had a valid patent because it withheld
important test information from the U.S. Patent Office.
   In addition, he said, the system Weisman developed was already
covered in a British patent for super-absorbing materials issued to
an Italian inventor in 1979.
   ``In order to have a valid patent, you can't be the second
person or the 10th person (to invent something). You have to be the
first,'' he said.
   White argued that Kimberly-Clark had widespread experience with
super-absorbent materials as early as 1977 in the manufacture of
tampons and adult diapers.
   ``Kimberly-Clark didn't need lessons from anyone about super
absorbent products,'' White said, noting that ``the only things our
scientists learned from the Wichita diapers was how not to make a
diaper.''
   White said the problem with the Pampers when they were
introduced was that the super-absorbing material would come off on
the skin of babies.
   It was a problem Kimberly-Clark was trying to address in its own
labs at the time, he said, adding the company eventually developed
a system of putting the material farther away from the babies' skin
_ a system for which the company has been awarded a patent.
   The case is being heard in a non-jury proceeding. It was brought
in South Carolina because Kimberly-Clark runs a diaper
manufacturing plant in Beech Island near Aiken.
