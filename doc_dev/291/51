   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Monday it is considering
legal action against Camp, the Spanish cleaning products company,
following reports that Camp had been sold to a West German company
despite a signed sales agreement with Procter valued at 31.7 billion
pesetas, or $264.1 million.
   Procter &amp; Gamble's Spanish representative Eduardo Baeza said in a
prepared statement that the household products manufacturer based in
Cincinnati, Ohio, had concluded a sales agreement with Camp in June
that included a down payment of 1.5 billion pesetas.
   Baeza, calling the situation ``an authentic financial scandal,''
said Procter &amp; Gamble learned Monday from press reports of the sale
of Camp to Joh A. Benckiser GmbH for 36 billion pesetas.
   Baeza said the purchase agreement with Procter &amp; Gamble included
the stipulation that Camp would not talk or negotiate with other
interested buyers.
   In Cincinnati, Procter &amp; Gamble's Patrick Hayes said, ``P&amp;G has
not taken any legal action against Camp. We are considering legal
action. It's one of our options.''
   Delvico Bates, public relations representatives of the West
German firm in Spain, said in a statement Monday the sale took place
Monday but that details had not been made public.
   The statement said Camp, founded in 1934, made 30 billion pesetas
in sales last year in household and industrial detergents and
ingredients for cosmetics.
   Baeza said company owners Albert, Jose and Juan Camp notified the
Economy Ministry's Foreign Transaction Division June 27 of the
agreement of sale with Procter &amp; Gamble and received the go-ahead
July 10.
   Baeza said the Camp brothers failed to show up for an appointment
at an attorney's office last Friday to finalize the sale.
   Procter and Gamble has been in Spain for 20 years. Benckiser's
Spanish operation distributed the water treatment products Calgon
and Calgonit.
