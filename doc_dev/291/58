<TEXT>      Peoria can be a tough audience, as P&amp;G discovered. Consumers rejected
Pampers at 10 cents apiece. P&amp;G persisted and got the price down to 6 cents
each.;    Now, 30 years later, disposable diapers are one of the big three D's
of P&amp;G product categories, along with detergents and dentifrices.;    Pampers
sales boomed with the baby boom. In the 1980s, the product reached global
proportions: The diapers are sold in 75 countries outside the United States.
P&amp;G's premium-priced companion diaper, Luvs, can be found in 30 nations.;   
"Worldwide disposable diaper unit volumes have risen 15 percent each of the
past two years," said Richard D. Nicolosi, group vice president of P&amp;G's paper
products division worldwide.;    "They are a very healthy and a significant
part of our business.";    Before P&amp;G began its test-marketing in Peoria food
stores the small number of disposables produced were purchased in drug or
department stores.;    The idea for P&amp;G's disposable diaper was conceived in
1956 by Victor Mills, a P&amp;G researcher and baby-sitting grandfather who
disliked handling soiled diapers. He asked several associates to develop a
disposable diaper.;    The first effort was an insert that fit into plastic
pants, tested in the summer of 1957 in Dallas. Texas mothers didn't like the
concept because the plastic pants worn by their babies in the hot summer
caused heat rash.;    At the time, fewer than 1 percent of the billions of
diapers changed in the United States annually were disposables. P&amp;G saw that
as a burgeoning market.;    By March 1959, P&amp;G engineers had come up with a
new version -- a disposable diaper that was softer, more absorbent, with an
improved "moisture barrier.";    The P&amp;G staff laboriously hand-assembled
37,000 diapers in both tape-on and pin-on design for a test in Rochester, N.Y.
Residents liked the product and chose the pin-on design.;    After testing a
number of names for the new diaper -- Solo, Tads and Larks -- Pampers was
selected.;    The diaper was made in a three-layer design of plastic back
sheet, absorbent wadding and water-repellent top sheet next to the baby's
skin.;    "Looking back, they had the worst of two systems -- hot plastic and
an insert to replace the cloth diaper," said Nicolosi.;    "But by the 1961
test in Peoria they had created a total concept with the product, package
design, the name and advertising positioning.;    "The good news was the
product was appealing to consumers. The bad news was that at 10 cents it
ordained a manufacturing challenge to find a way to mass produce the diapers
to get the cost down.;    "What they designed was a lot simpler process than
we have today, a Z-fold process at high speed. The modern machinery moves so
fast you can't see the diapers.";    Pampers today has 14 elements and Luvs
has 12.;    "One of our competitors one-upped us with an anatomically shaped
diaper that resulted in fewer gaps and leaks," said Nicolosi. "We responded
with Luvs Premium brand. We had test-marketed Luvs in 1970 and it was
available nationally by 1980.";    That competitor, Kimberly-Clark, also came
up with a tape-on or closure design that P&amp;G had tested earlier but passed
over because Rochester residents preferred pins.;    Today, Nicolosi said,
price no longer is as important to consumers as performance.;    "If you are a
parent getting up at 3 a.m. to tend a crying baby and have to change the
baby's clothes and bedding, 5 cents for a diaper isn't an overriding factor,"
he said.;    "About 85 percent of the disposable diaper is compostable," he
said. "Our goal in 1991 is to make it 100 percent.; Swaddling the; diaper
market; (box)Disposable diapers totaled 18 percent, or $4.3 billion, of P&amp;G's
worldwide sales for the fiscal year 1990 ended June 30, said Richard D.
Nicolosi, group vice president of P&amp;G's paper products division worldwide.;
(box)Pampers and Luvs command 50.3 percent of the U.S. disposable diaper
market, analysts say. Pampers has 29.3 percent and Luvs 21 percent. Huggies,
the disposable made by Kimberly-Clark, has a 29 percent market share. The
remaining sales are divided among all other diaper makers.; (box)The U.S.
disposable diaper market is estimated at $3.5 billion in annual sales or 16
billion diapers. The potential worldwide market is estimated at $8 billion.;
