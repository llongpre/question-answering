   CINCINNATI -- Procter &amp; Gamble Co. created six management
operating units and named 39 new officers to better reflect
its international expansion.
   And for the first time in its 154-year history, the
consumer-products company named two women vice presidents.

   Martha Miller de Lombera, 43-year-old general manager of
health and beauty care for the U.K. and Ireland, was named
vice president in charge of that same business for a new
operating unit, Procter &amp; Gamble Europe. And Barbara H.
Fraser, 42-year-old general manager, paper products in
Canada, was named vice president in charge of that business
for a new operating unit, Procter &amp; Gamble Canada and Latin
America.
   P&amp;G officials termed the organization changes a "natural
evolution" of its global business that reflects how the
company is actually operated.
   The reshuffling changes a lot of titles, but doesn't
change the responsibilities of officers or how the business
is managed, P&amp;G officials said. The company now has 95
officers, up from 56 previously.
   Officers will now be aligned with the P&amp;G parent company
or with one of the six new management operating units:
Procter &amp; Gamble Worldwide, Procter &amp; Gamble International,
Procter &amp; Gamble USA, Procter &amp; Gamble Europe, Procter &amp;
Gamble Far East and Procter &amp; Gamble Canada and Latin
America.
