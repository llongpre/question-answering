   Kimberly-Clark Corp., catching up from its laggard introduction of a super-thin disposable diaper, expects to report its first-quarter net income rose 2.5% to about $75 million, or $1.63 a share, on a 14% sales increase. 

   In the year-earlier quarter, the big paper and consumer products concern earned $73.2 million, or $1.60 a share, on sales of $1.04 billion. 
The company expects to report sales of about $1.2 billion for the recent quarter. 

   Kimberly-Clark's chairman and chief executive officer, Darwin E. Smith, who told securities analysts in January that he expected the company to report 1987 earnings of $7 a share, said he sees "no reason" to alter his forecast. 

   The company is now marketing nationally its Supertrim diaper, a thinner, more absorbent version of its Huggies diaper, Mr. Smith said. 
But it lagged by several months Procter &amp; Gamble Corp.'s introduction of a similar diaper, and saw its share of the diaper market dip to about 25%. 
Mr. Smith said the company's diaper stake has since recovered to about 31%. 

   Kimberly-Clark's profits were squeezed by a nearly 20% increase in promotional expenses related to the thinner diaper, and from a substantial decrease in income from equity investments, which accounted for about 13% of the company's 1986 net, he said. 

   Kimberly-Clark's stock, whose price has soared more than 70% in the past few months, closed yesterday at $109.25 a share, down $3.50, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
