   Peace activists on Friday urged consumers to
boycott Folgers coffee in an effort to persuade Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. to stop buying coffee from war-torn El Salvador.
   About a dozen members of Peaceworks, a coalition of Cincinnati
peace activist organizations, picketed outside Procter &amp; Gamble's
corporate headquarters.
   The activists support a coffee boycott announced in November by
the San Francisco-based group Neighbor to Neighbor, Peaceworks
spokeswoman Kateri Koverman said. Demonstrators wore blue buttons
reading ``Boycott Salvadoran Coffee: Stop Funding Death Squads.''
   A P&amp;G spokesman said the company would not change its
coffee-buying policy.
   Activists met with P&amp;G officials in December to urge the company
to stop buying Salvadoran coffee. They said P&amp;G is being targeted
because it has appeared less responsive than rival coffee producers
Hills Bros. Coffee and Nestle Foods Corp. about the issue.
   Hills Bros. and Nestle in December agreed to suspend coffee
purchase from El Salvador for 30 days.
   Boycott supporters claim money from U.S. coffee buyers enriches
wealthy Salvadoran families backing that country's civil war.
   But Procter &amp; Gamble says purchase of Salvadoran coffee benefits
workers in El Salvador. The company also says the Bush
administration and the State Department encourage open trade with
the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government.
   ``We believe the U.S. government is best equipped to make
decisions on foreign policy and foreign governments for our
country, and the Bush administration and the State Department
strongly support our country's open trade with El Salvador,'' P&amp;G
spokesman Donald Tassone said.
   He said P&amp;G buys coffee from at least 30 countries, and the
Salvadoran product amounts to less than 2 percent of the coffee
used to produce the Folgers blend.
   ``As a company, we can't let a very small but vocal group inject
us into their dispute with the U.S. government, no matter how well
intentioned it might be,'' he said.
