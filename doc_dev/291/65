   The government said the deficit in the
broadest measure of U.S. trade sank to a five-year low last year,
but the $105.9 billion imbalance still pushed the country deeper
into the hole as the world's largest debtor nation.
   America's current account balance narrowed by 16 percent over a
$126.6 billion deficit in 1988, reflecting growth in exports,
higher overseas earnings of American businesses and increased
spending by visiting foreign tourists, the Commerce Department said
Tuesday.
   The year ended on a positive note as the October-December trade
deficit declined to $20.57 billion, down 10.2 percent from its
third quarter level. It was the smallest quarterly imbalance in
almost six years.

   Retail sales in February took their steepest
fall in four months, the government reported, but analysts said the
decline was due almost entirely to sagging automobiles sales.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted $146.5 billion. The decline was the biggest
since a 1.3 percent drop in October and followed a strong 2.8
percent gain in January. The January number originally had been
reported at 1.6 percent.

   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. lost $39 million in its most
crucial quarter following a disappointing Christmas shopping
season, increasing the financial pressures on the debt-burdened
retailing chain.
   Macy, which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986, said
Tuesday that the markdowns the company was forced to take to
compete with price cutting at Campeau Corp.'s department stores
took a heavy toll on its balance sheet.
   The second-quarter loss, which translated to $27.67 per share,
compared with the $72.6 million, or $39.85 per share, Macy earned
in the same period a year earlier.

   Rorer Group Inc. said it will work
jointly with the consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble to
develop and market prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical
products.
