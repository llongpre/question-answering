   The Spanish-language television network
Telemundo and consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble are
launching a half-hour program in which Procter's products will be
prominently featured as solutions to a variety of common domestic
problems, the companies said Monday.
   The show is called Hablando and will appear on the Telemundo
network twice a week starting Tuesday afternoon.
   The Telemundo network is one of the nation's largest
Spanish-language TV networks, reaching 36 major markets and an
estimated 78 percent of the Hispanic housholds in the United States.
   Telemundo Productions, which is producing the show, described
the program as ``infotainment,'' or a mixture of education,
information and entertainment.
   The show features three actors and guest appearances that
portray people in a variety of settings including the kitchen and
the laundry room.
   Procter &amp; Gamble brands such as Luvs diapers, Scope mouthwash
and Tide laundry detergent are prominently displayed and used
during various segments of the program in which topics such as
caring for the baby, personal hygiene or cleaning the family wash
are discussed.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is also the sole national advertiser on the
program, pitching many of the same products that appear within the
show in the four minutes of network commercials allowed each half
hour.
   Critics of ``infotainment'' or ``infomercials'' say shows that
pitch specific products in return for a fee from the manufacturer
are inappropriate because viewers may mistake them for
independently produced programs.
   But Saul P. Steinberg, chairman, president and chief executive
of Telemundo Group Inc., defended the arrangement with Procter &amp;
Gamble, saying that such associations are common on television in
Spanish-speaking countries.
   He said the program provides useful information on local customs
for people who may have only recently arrived, and that it would
have been a much more expensive undertaking without Procter &amp;
Gamble's sponsorship.
   Viewers will be the judge of the value of the program, Steinberg
said, saying it will survive for long if its ratings are poor.
   Nonetheless, he added that ``you can only do so much of this''
and wants a large majority of independent entertainment programming
on his network.
   Neil M. Comber, manager of target marketing for Cincinnati-based
Procter &amp; Gamble, said his company paid a premium of about 5
percent to 10 percent over the costs of commercials alone for the
right to have its products used in the program.
   He said the company also recently began sponsoring two-minute
informative programs that are being carried on Telemundo's
Spanish-language network rival, Univision. Those programs, which
air several times a day on Univision, are produced in conjunction
with the Spanish-language magazine La Familia de Hoy, published by
Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn.
