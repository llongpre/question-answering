Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was
raising the prices of some of its tissue products in the US by up to 8 per
cent because of higher pulp prices, but simultaneously announced an 11 per
cent cut in the price of its Luvs disposable nappies.
The company also said it was turning Luvs into a unisex product instead of
having different types of nappy for each sex. It said the resulting cost
savings, combined with higher volumes flowing from the price cut, should
have a positive effect on profits.
Analysts say Luvs has about 13 per cent of the US disposable nappy market.
Pampers, another Procter &amp; Gamble product, has 26 per cent, Kimberly-Clark's
Huggies 30 per cent, and the rest is taken by private label products.
