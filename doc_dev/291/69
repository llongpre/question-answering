   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., continuing to benefit from a lower tax rate, said its fiscal third-quarter net income surged nearly 40% to $263 million, from $188 million. 
Sales rose 15% to $4.86 billion from $4.22 billion. 

   Nearly half of the Cincinnati-based consumer products company's profit rise reflected a drop in its effective tax rate to 33.1% from 44.5%. 
Still, operating profits climbed about 16% to $393 million from $339 million a year earlier. 

   Per-share net for the quarter ended March 31 was $1.53, up from $1.10 the year earlier. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, P&amp;G closed yesterday at $78.75 a share, up 37.5 a share. 

   "It was a very solid quarter, but pretty much as expected," said Jay H. Freedman, analyst at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. 

   In addition to lower taxes, analysts said the company benefited from "extremely strong" sales trends. 
"I was very impressed," said Hugh S. Zurkhulen, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. 
"We're returning to an era of a stability at P&amp;G." 

   Unit volume shipments overall rose 10%, analysts said, suggesting that P&amp;G wasn't hurt by lower profit margins on certain products and that its market share in the U.S. remained stable. 

   Analysts said that the company's international business continued to grow at a faster clip than the domestic side. 
Jack L. Salzman, analyst at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., said P&amp;G's operating profits domestically in the quarter were either flat or modestly better than a year earlier, while operating profit overseas jumped 40%. 

   Strong performances in diapers, liquid detergents -- previously shunned by Europeans -- and from its Richardson-Vicks Inc. drug unit helped P&amp;G abroad. 
Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Mr. Zurkhulen noted that the Pampers diaper line, which once had sluggish results outside the U.S., "has really turned around overseas." 
Indeed, he expects the company to make money selling diapers in Japan for the first time next year. 

   For its first nine months, P&amp;G said earnings rose 35% to $880 million, from $651 million, while per-share net rose to $5.14, from $3.82 the year earlier. 
The company's tax rate for the nine months was 37.4%, down from 45.7%. 
Sales in the period increased nearly 12% to $14.36 billion from $12.83 billion.
