   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission said it
would clear a series of sanitary-product joint ventures
between Procter &amp; Gamble Co. of the U.S. and Italy's Finaf
S.p.A. following agreement by the companies to make changes.
   In November 1990, the commission launched a competition
inquiry into the companies' creation of joint ventures in
Italy, Spain and Portugal and the acquisition by Procter &amp;
Gamble of Finaf's United Kingdom diaper company, Swaddlers.

   Under the original deal, Finaf would have transferred its
assets to the joint ventures and withdrawn from the market as
a manufacturer. But the commission feared that under this
arrangement, the companies would have divided between them
the $5.5 billion EC market for sanitary products. To ease
these fears, the commission said, Finaf agreed not to sell
Swaddlers to Procter &amp; Gamble.
   Joint ventures JBC-Italia in Italy; Ausonia II, Spain; and
Lepori II, Portugal, will be free to choose what they produce
and in what quantities under new accords from the parent
companies. The joint ventures will independently set prices
and sales conditions and have agreed not to partition or
share out the European sanitary-products market, an EC
statement said.
   The commission will invite comments from other companies
before officially clearing the deal, an EC spokesman said.
