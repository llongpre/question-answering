<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Pulls Ads Over Critical TV Spot</HEAD>

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. pulled $1 million of
advertising from a television station that had run ads saying
coffee made by the company brews ``misery, destruction and death''
in El Salvador.
   The 30-second spots were bought by a group that advocates a
boycott of Folgers coffee because it includes Salvadoran beans,
said Sy Yanoff, president and general manager of WHDH-TV.
   The group, Neighbor to Neighbor, paid $1,000 for each of two
spots on Wednesday and Thursday, and the advertisements were
cleared with the station's lawyers, he said.
   ``(The ad) met our commercial and good-taste standards,'' Yanoff
said Thursday.
   Don Tassone, a spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble, said the spots
``disparaged'' Folgers coffee. ``It's advocacy advertising and
we're surprised that any television station is willing to run that
type of ad,'' he said.
   The Boston Globe said WHDH was the only station in the country
to run the ad, which is narrated by actor Ed Asner, a critic of
U.S. military aid to the Salvadoran government.
   ``If you want peace in El Salvador, tell Congress to stop our
massive military handouts and tell your supermarket that you refuse
to buy Folgers, which uses coffee grown in El Salvador. Boycott
Folgers coffee _ What it brews is misery, destruction and death,''
Asner says in the ad.
   ``It's misleading and it's grossly inaccurate,'' Tassone said.
``This ad singles out Folgers even though virtually every U.S.
brand contains some Salvadoran coffee.''
   Neighbor to Neighbor says coffee income enriches wealthy
Salvadorans allied with the rightist Salvadoran government. It says
it has targeted P&amp;G for the boycott because the firm was less
responsive on the issue than its competitors.
   Yanoff said Procter &amp; Gamble at first told him they would pull
only their ads for Folgers coffee, but the station was told
Thursday the firm would pull all its advertising, worth $70,000 for
June and about $1 million for the year.
