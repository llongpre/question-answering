   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. announced Thursday it
plans to construct a combined headquarters and technical center on
Rokko Island in Japan in a new city under construction by Osaka Bay.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said the new building will consolidate
headquarter functions now spread over five locations in Osaka, and
will be home for certain research and development functions now
handled in the United States.
   The building, scheduled to be completed in December 1992, will
also provide product and packaging development support for Japan and
the Asia Pacific region, P&amp;G officials said.
   The Cincinnati-based company said its decision to establish the
research facility recognizes Japan as a major source of product and
packaging technology for P&amp;G's worldwide business. The consumer
products company had worldwide sales of $21.4 billion for the fiscal
year ended June 30.
