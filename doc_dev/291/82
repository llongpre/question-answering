   Home diaper delivery service is bottoming
out in Philadelphia, in what some industry watchers say is another
sign of the nationwide hard times facing an old-fashioned product.
   Damaged by the growth of disposable diapers, Dy-Dee Diaper
Service of Westmont, N.J., dropped its home-delivery service early
this month after almost 50 years and has laid off about 20 percent
of its workforce.
   Dy-Dee's longtime competitor, Dy-Dee Service of Philadelphia,
absorbed a few hundred customers, saw its local sales rise by 14
percent and is ``not hurting at all,'' says general manager Jake
Pilkington.
   But 12 other such services have dried up locally over the past
20 years.
   Nationally, the numbers have dropped by more than half to about
200 during that time, according to John A. Shiffert, executive
director of the Philadelphia-based National Association of Diaper
Services.
   Industry analysts estimate that disposables now account for up
to 90 percent of all diapers used, although Shiffert puts the
figure at 60 percent to 70 percent. He also contends that as many
babies, up to 800,000 nationwide, wear delivered cloth diapers as
they did 20 years ago.
   Shiffert and Odd Knutstad, manager of the Westmont company,
blame the intense, 20-year advertising campaign by disposable
diaper manufacturers for the demise of home delivery.
   ``By the time the baby is born, the woman has seen the ad
hundreds and hundreds of times for Pampers, and is seduced by them.
Her husband also,'' Knutstad said.
   ``We sent them literature, we called, but most people said,
`I've already made up my mind. I'm going to take disposables like
I've seen on TV.'''
   Diaper delivery services began declining drastically in the
mid-1960s, when Procter &amp; Gamble Co., one of the first companies to
manufacture disposable diapers, stepped up its advertising
nationwide, Shiffert said.
   ``Disposable diapers before then were looked upon as temporary
things for travel,'' he said.
   As a result of the blitz, many family-owned diaper businesses
failed or were bought by larger companies, Shiffert said.
   In 1987, combined sales of Luvs and Pampers brands amounted to
nearly 16 percent of Procter &amp; Gamble's $17 billion in revenue.
   Knutstad also blamed the growth of disposables on working
mothers, who have are not at home to receive solicitations from
delivery services. But peers in the business believe working
mothers will be the factor that turns the industry around.
   For example, Pilkington said two-career couples want the
convenience of a diaper service and can afford it. Disposables cost
at least $11 a box a week while Dy-Dee Service charges $12.25 for
90 diapers a week.
   Pilkington and Shiffert also think mounting trash disposal
problems will ultimately restrict the use of disposable products.
Ecologically-minded people already use diaper services, they said.
   Dy-Dee Service in Philadelphia predicts it will expand
deliveries beyond its current 4,000 households. The company, a
division of General Health Care Corp. of Piscataway, N.J., operates
18 growing diaper-delivery services nationwide, Pilkington said.
   Knutstad also foresees an improving market but said it will not
develop soon enough for the Westmont firm. The company will
concentrate on accounts with nursing homes and diversify its
services for at least five years, when it might again target homes.
