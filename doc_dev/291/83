   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it has formed a joint venture
with Eguimad, an Argentina maker of disposable diapers and
sanitary napkins.

<TEXT>
   The new company, Eguimad S.A., will take over Eguimad's
paper business, including Duffy, the country's leading brand
of diapers, and Yes, the market's leading sanitary napkin.
   Eguimad, a privately held company, employs 300 people and
operates two plants, in Buenos Aires and the province of San
Luis.
   John E. Pepper, P&amp;G president, said the venture gives the
consumer-products company access to "important new
categories" in Argentina. P&amp;G, based in Cincinnati,
previously sold such products as Pantene, Old Spice and
Metamucil through licensees in Argentina.
