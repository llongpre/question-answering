   Animal-rights activists said Monday they are
beginning a nationwide boycott of Procter &amp; Gamble Co. to pressure
the company into stopping the use of animals in product safety
tests.
   The giant consumer products company said it has been studying
alternatives but that there aren't sufficient methods available to
make the elimination of animal tests possible.
   Holly Hazard, executive director of the Washington-based Doris
Day Animal League, met with company representatives at Procter &amp;
Gamble's headquarters to present her group's demands, but said
later she was disappointed with the results.
   She told a news conference earlier Monday that 36,000 of the
Doris Day League's members nationwide have returned cards
indicating they will support the boycott.
   The group accuses the Cincinnati-based P&amp;G of needlessly
torturing rabbits and other animals in laboratory tests in which
cosmetics and other products are forced into the eyes to document
exposure risks.
   P&amp;G, which manufactures a wide range of products from Crest
toothpaste to Pampers disposable diapers, had $21.4 billion in
worldwide sales during the past year.
   The Doris Day group and other animal-rights associations,
including In Defense of Animals and People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, say the tests are cruel, unnecessary and
produce irrelevant data that could be replaced by more humane tests.
   Ms. Hazard said P&amp;G representatives turned down her requests
Monday to provide data on the number of animals used in testing and
would not commit the company to support bills before Congress
designed to phase out the use of animals in testing.
   She said P&amp;G officials also refused to disavow any relationship
or contribution to the Animal Testing Coalition, which
animal-rights activists say is an industry group secretly committed
to battling the activists and persuading the public that animal
testing is necessary.
   P&amp;G spokeswoman Linda Ulrey said the company proposed the
coalition only as an industry vehicle to educate the public that
sufficient alternatives haven't been develped to permit the
elimination of animals in product tests.
   Ms. Ulrey said P&amp;G has spent $10 million in the last three years
on research into alternatives. She said that compares with $150,000
that P&amp;G plans to spend this year on the industry coalition.
   She said alternatives to animal testing include scientific
data-based predictions of effects of product exposure, and
computer-simulated results of exposure.
   This year several companies, including cosmetics maker Avons
Products Inc., have announced that they were discontinuing animal
tests and replacing them with alternative methods.
   But Ms. Ulrey said: ``Right now, the scientific community says
you cannot completely walk away from animal testing.''
   P&amp;G has won recognition for its research into alternatives to
animal testing and will receive an award in recognition next month
from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, Ms. Ulrey said.
   Ms. Hazard and other activists said Monday they will stage
demonstrations at P&amp;G headquarters during the company's Oct. 10
shareholders' meeting. They also said they will demonstrate that
day at other P&amp;G opeations in Baltimore; Chicago; Dallas;
Greensboro, N.C.; Hatboro, Pa.; Iowa City, Iowa; Kansas City, Mo.:
Oxnard, Calif.: Phoenix, Ariz.: and Sacramento, Calif.
   Animal-rights activists have picketed P&amp;G's shareholders
meetings before. In 1987, P&amp;G's shareholders followed the company's
recommendation in rejecting a resolution to stop using animals in
product testing.
   In 1988, the shareholders followed P&amp;G's recommendation to
reject a resolution that would have required the company to
disclose the numbers of animals used in tests and how much it cost.
   P&amp;G officials have consistently refused to release such
information, saying it is privileged and is not necessarily
relevant for comparison with other corporations.
