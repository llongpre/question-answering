   Drackett Co., the Cincinnati-based maker of
Windex, Drano, and other cleaning products, is losing its third
president in six years.
   The company confirmed Wednesday that Douglas G. Cowan, who has
been Drackett's president since April 1988, would take an
indefinite leave of absence for health reasons. Cowan, 56, is
believed to have heart problems.
   Taking his place will be Thomas L. Dahl, president of branded
consumer products for Weyerhaeuser Co., a paper products and lumber
company from the Seattle, Wash., area.
   Dahl, 44, officially will join Drackett today as executive vice
president. He will become president April 1.
   Drackett spokesman David S. Perkins confirmed Cowan's plans.
   In 1984, Nick Evans, who had been Drackett's president since
1966, left the company to become a senior executive at its parent
company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. William F. Flatley took Evans'
job, but left in 1988, also for a spot in the parent company.
   Cowan, who joined Drackett in 1983, was promoted from senior
vice president following Flatley's departure.
   Cowan came to Drackett after 27 years at the Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. of Cincinnati. When he left P&amp;G as director of product
development for packaged soaps and detergents, P&amp;G sued Drackett,
saying Cowan would leak trade secrets. The suit was settled out of
court.
   Before joining Weyerhaeuser, Dahl was president of the infant
care business at Kimberly-Clark Corp., where he made that company's
Huggies disposable diaper the No.1 brand, displacing P&amp;G's Pampers.
