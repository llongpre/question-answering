<LEADPARA>  FROM A PURELY jingoistic American perspective, the single most depressing
comment I've heard about U.S. competitiveness was uttered by Applied Materials
Chief Executive James C. Morgan.;    "No question," he said. "We learn more
from our Japanese customers than we do from our American ones. . . . That's
beginning to change, but much of our success in the rest of the world comes
from what we learn from our best Japanese customers."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now, Santa Clara-based Applied Materials is as high tech as they come.
Morgan's company is the largest independent producer of the wafer-fabrication
equipment so crucial to the manufacture of silicon chips. That market is
global, relentlessly competitive and extraordinarily capital-intensive. It's
innovate and invest -- or die.;    Even though Applied Materials' stiffest
competitors are affiliated with Japan's biggest electronics concerns, more
than 40 percent of the company's revenues come from Japan. (Morgan and his son
recently wrote a book on participating in the Japanese market). The ability to
capitalize on knowledge gleaned from working with some of Japan's most
demanding chip manufacturers has been key to Applied Materials' global growth.
The insights and ideas that ignite innovation at this ostensibly American
company increasingly come from Japan.;    That's depressing. Harvard Business
School competitiveness guru Michael Porter stresses in his studies of globally
successful businesses that smart customers are key to assuring that suppliers
remain energetic and innovative. Smart customers get smart suppliers; stupid
customers get stupid suppliers. By that measure, a lot of American companies
qualify as morons.;    Procter &amp; Gamble Chief Executive Edwin L. Artzt tells
the story about a problem the consumer products giant had with its Pampers
disposable diapers. It seems the company was having trouble mass-producing the
thin rubber leggings that keep the Pampers from leaking. According to Artzt,
the thinness of the rubber caused it to "creep" and made high-speed production
of the Pampers virtually impossible. The problem would cost the company
millions.;    In desperation, says Artzt, Procter &amp; Gamble did something it
had never done before: The company invited the supplier into the plant to look
at the problem. The supplier looked at the problem and said two words, "Golf
balls." It turns out the supplier was the leading manufacturer of the
ultra-thin, tightly wound rubber filaments that form golf ball cores, which
gave the supplier the expertise to solve P&amp;G's production problem.;    This
happened less than a decade ago, and Artzt's Procter &amp; Gamble still has a
reputation for clutching its "proprietary" manufacturing and marketing
procedures. How many other problems could be solved or opportunities created
if P&amp;G were more open with its vendors?;    The fact is that companies like
Procter &amp; Gamble have a wealth of resources available to them by displaying
the simple willingness to learn. The reality is that most companies are too
busy doing "market research" to learn from their customers and too busy
setting "quality standards" for suppliers to learn from them.;    It's not
that these companies necessarily suffer from the NIH -- Not Invented Here --
syndrome that reflexively rejects ideas from the outside. The real problem is
that there is nothing in the reward structures or cultures of most American
companies that encourages people to learn from "outsiders." When was the last
time you heard of a meeting where people discussed what they learned from
their customers instead of what the marketing department had learned about
their customers? How about a meeting where a company decided to reward
suppliers for the ideas they helped generate to improve the business as much
as the products and services they sold?;    As any elementary schoolteacher
will tell you, listening is a necessary but insufficient condition for
learning to take place. The kind of learning that needs to go on at an Applied
Materials or a Procter &amp; Gamble requires much richer and more intense personal
interactions. That's now the nature of learning in an increasingly complex and
technology-intensive environment.;    Sure, chief executives yammer endlessly
about being "market driven" or "customer driven" -- as if their organizations
were limos or minivans. But customers (or, for that matter, suppliers) are
neither chauffeurs nor back-seat drivers. They are, for better and worse and,
especially, richer or poorer, partners in enterprise.;    Partners who learn
from one another tend to do better than those who dictate terms (or, even
worse, politely listen) to one another. The economy would be a lot better off
if more companies would take as much pride in how much they learned as in how
much they made.  </TEXT>
