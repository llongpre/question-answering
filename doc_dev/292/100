   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday its fiscal
third quarter profit jumped 40 percent over a year ago, boosted by
a lower federal tax rate.
   The consumer products giant said it netted $263 million, or
$1.53 a share, for the three months ended March 31, compared with
earnings of $188 million, or $1.10 a share, last year.
   Worldwide sales also rose, to $4.8 billion from $4.2 billion.
   For the first nine months of the company's 1987-88 fiscal year,
net income totaled $880 million, or $5.14 a share, on sales of
$4.86 billion. That compared with earnings of $651 million, or
$3.82 a share, and $4.22 billion in sales.
   Procter &amp; Gamble attributed its improved third quarter results
largely to a lower tax rate.
   Procter &amp; Gamble produces a variety of consumer goods, including
laundry and cleaning products, personal card products,
pharmaceuticals, food and beverage products.
   The Cincinnati-based company had sales of $17 billion in its
last fiscal year.
