KIMBERLY-CLARK and Procter &amp; Gamble, the two major diaper manufacturers in
the US, have reached out of court settlements on patent and other disputes
after nearly seven years of litigation, Reuters reports.
Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark announced that an anti-trust action, due to be
heard in federal court in Dallas yesterday , patent lawsuits and other
disputes in the US, Canada and Britain were included in the settlement with
Ohio-based Procter &amp; Gamble.
Details of the settlement are confidential, but Kimberly-Clark's director of
corporate communications, Ms Jean Allen, said her company 'is pleased with
the terms'.
The 'diaper war' has been waged since August 1985 when Proctor &amp; Gamble
brought a patent-infringement action against Kimberly-Clark, citing use of
an elastic waistband material. Kimberly-Clark counter-sued, alleging Proctor
&amp; Gamble was attempting to monopolise the disposable diaper market.
In July 1987 a Dallas court found in favour of Kimberly-Clark's waistband,
declaring the P&amp;G patent invalid. The decision was upheld on appeal.
Over the next five years, Proctor &amp; Gamble brought various
patent-infringement charges against Kimberly-Clark, while the latter
continued to accuse P&amp;G of anti-trust violations.
