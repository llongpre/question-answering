   The diaper that made disposable a household word is about to be changed. 

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., keenly aware that Pampers has lost a startling chunk of market share, isn't talking. 
But people close to the consumer-products company say a new, improved Pampers -- along with an expensive ad campaign -- will come before year end. 

   "They say they have to do something," says Bonita Austin, analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. "Pampers isn't No. 1 anymore," adds Hugh Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers, "and that disappoints them." 

   Pampers is now the underdog, and making a comeback will be tough. 
Its share of the market has eroded to about 26% -- down from 59% in 1980 and down from 75% in the mid-1970s. 
Huggies, meanwhile, the rival brand made by Kimberly-Clark Corp., has grabbed 31% of the market, up from a mere 9% in 1980. 

   Some analysts claim that P&amp;G, after making early improvements in super-absorbency, essentially ignored Pampers. 
Kimberly-Clark, meanwhile, hasn't stopped tinkering with Huggies in recent years. 
Both products are about the same price, but Huggies has been aggressive in making changes such as softer elastic and in advertising those improvements. 

   "Procter fell asleep too long with Pampers," Mr. Zurkuhlen says. 

   Yet another reason for Pampers' decline is a sibling rivalry with Luvs, also made by P&amp;G. 
Luvs' share has grown to 24% from 11% in 1980, largely at the expense of Pampers. 
Luvs Deluxe, diapers with strategic lining designed in a boys' version and a girls' version, has been particularly successful. 
But in bringing out Luvs, the company wanted to create a premium segment; it hadn't intended to rob Pampers of sales. 
And even with Pampers and Luvs together, P&amp;G's diaper market share isn't what it used to be. 

   On top of everything, the diaper market is relatively flat, with sales steady at about $3.5 billion a year. 
The new Pampers is likely to include one or more improvements. 
It may be thinner or have better-sticking tape fasteners. 
Or it may include "cuffs" that block leakage around the leg openings. 

   Cincinnati-based P&amp;G already sells cuffed diapers in Japan, but Huggies has beat them to the U.S. Earlier this year, Dallas-based Kimberly added a strip of cuff-like material inside the leg openings of its Huggies Supertrims. 
The material acts as a dam to stop leakage. 
The diaper, available in a few Western states, is expected to be launched soon nationwide. 

   The new Pampers is bound to trigger a diaper battle. 
"We'll probably get another marketing war," with both P&amp;G and Kimberly-Clark advertising heavily and offering lots of coupons, says Jack Salzman, analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Prices could also come down. 

   Kimberly-Clark won't comment, but marketing specialists say Huggies isn't going to yield ground easily. 
"Huggies has got a lot of momentum going already," and that will only increase with the new cuffed product, predicts Lynne Hyman, analyst with First Boston Corp. 

   Meanwhile, both Pampers and Huggies face the challenge of coming up with biodegradable diapers to answer growing environmental concerns. 
RMed International Inc. of Sedona, Ariz., claims its diaper is more than 90% biodegradable, compared with 60% for most disposable diapers. 

   P&amp;G disputes RMed International's claims of a superior product. 
Still, it may soon begin test marketing in Europe a diaper that has corn starch, an ingredient found to speed disintegration of plastic.
