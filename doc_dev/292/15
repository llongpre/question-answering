   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

   DISPOSABLE DIAPERS WERE BORN IN 1961, a near-record baby-boom year, and soon threatened the safety pin and triangle fold. 

   That year the product still accounted for less than 1% of the 60 to 100 weekly changes on the 4.3 million babies born in the U.S. 
The official baby-boom era was 1948-1964. 

   After World War II, a Swedish company had sold baby diapers with insertable pads, but they were inconvenient and leaked. 
The pioneer of the idea for a truly disposable diaper reportedly was Vic Mills, the Procter &amp; Gamble engineer who had made Ivory soap sudsier. 
In late 1956, Mills suggested to a P&amp;G group that a fluffy paper product applied to a baby's bottom would sell. 

   His proteges -- Robert C. Duncan and Norma L. Baker, two Procter &amp; Gamble scientists -- developed the idea and filled a patent on Pampers on July 17, 1961; it was awarded in 1965. 
Its test of Pampers (plastic over an absorbent pad) in Peoria, Ill., didn't play well because of the 10 cents-a-pad price. 
A 1966 test in Sacramento, Calif., at six cents a pad was a success. 

   New competitors jumped in to fight for the market. 
Kimberly-Clark's Kimbies came in 1968 with a more-absorbent pad and tape closures. 
This company followed in 1978 with hourglass-shaped, elastic fit Huggies. 
P&amp;G responded in 1980 with "superabsorbent" Luvs, which had elastic gathers. 
In between, Johnson &amp; Johnson from 1971 to 1981 offered Chux. 

   Currently, disposables account for about 80% to 85% of the $3 billion-plus annual diaper market, with the balance held by cloth diaper services or those still using the pin and cloth. 
There have been charges that disposables in landfills could be harmful to the public's health. 
Kimberly-Clark, claiming that less than 1% of landfill is diapers, is seeking new materials degradable under the sun's rays. 
And P&amp;G is working on recycling ideas.
