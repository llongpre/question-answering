nappy changes - The group hopes to regain market share with its latest price
cuts

Here is a puzzle. Pulp prices are rocketing worldwide, so companies making
paper-based products are under pressure to raise their prices too. Yet
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, announced earlier this
week that it was cutting the US price of its Luvs disposable nappies
(diapers in the US) by 11 per cent. What is Procter &amp; Gamble's game?
At first glance, the announcement sounded ominously like a repeat of
Marlboro Friday. Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes 15 per cent of its global
revenues from disposable nappies, said it was cutting the price of Luvs to
claw back market share from cheaper, store-branded and private label
nappies. Last year Philip Morris, another big US packaged goods maker,
employed much the same logic when it cut the price of Marlboro, its
top-selling cigarette brand, to reverse its loss of market share to cheaper,
generic brands.
So was this Diaper Tuesday? The comparison falters because Luvs, unlike
Marlboro, is not a premium product. Procter &amp; Gamble's top disposable nappy
brand in the US is Pampers, while Luvs is a value-for-money brand. Procter &amp;
Gamble says the Luvs price cut is intended merely to restore the product's
competitiveness with private label brands, which have recently become
cheaper.
Even so, the cut will hurt. US nappy prices have already fallen by about 20
per cent over the past two years because of tough competition between
Procter &amp; Gamble, the private label suppliers, and Kimberly-Clark, the US
paper products company that leads the US nappy market with its Huggies
brand. Furthermore, Procter &amp; Gamble is having to accompany the Luvs price
cut with a 2 per cent reduction in the US price of Pampers because Pampers
might otherwise start to look too expensive.
The puzzle is how Procter &amp; Gamble can afford it. Pulp prices, driven by
surging worldwide demand, have shot up by 80 per cent from their November
1993 low of Dollars 390 a tonne, and are rising fast. According to Mr Chip
Dillon, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, Procter &amp; Gamble gets through
700,000-800,000 tonnes of pulp a year in the US alone. So even by the most
conservative estimate, the company is facing an increase in pulp costs of
Dollars 200m a year in the US - equivalent to about 25 cents a share after
tax.
One way Procter &amp; Gamble plans to defray the cost is by increasing the price
of its other paper-based products. It said this week that it was raising the
US prices of its Charmin toilet tissue by 5 per cent, its Bounty paper
towels by 6 per cent and its Puffs facial tissues by 8 per cent. Meanwhile,
the Luvs price cut should be partially offset by increased sales.
The company is also cutting manufacturing costs. In July last year it set in
train a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000 jobs - about 12 per cent of
its global workforce - in response to competition from lower-priced
products. 'The efficiencies gained from those actions pay out at a time like
this,' the company says.
Procter &amp; Gamble insists that it expects to continue 'solid' sales and
earnings progress in spite of the nappy price cuts. Ms Lynne Hyman, an
analyst at CS First Boston, is less sure: she thinks the price increases on
tissue and towel products should cancel out the increased cost of pulp,
while lower production costs should balance out the price cuts for Luvs. 'I
would say it's fairly neutral, but a little bit of it is dependent on
getting some higher volumes, so there's a chance it could be slightly
negative,' she says.
If things do go wrong, one possible gainer should be Procter &amp; Gamble's
biggest US rival in paper products, Kimberly-Clark. Unlike Procter &amp; Gamble,
Kimberly-Clark is a pulp producer. Therefore if product prices rise, Procter
&amp; Gamble will be simply defraying higher raw material costs, while
Kimberly-Clark should see the full benefit at its bottom line.
Unfortunately, however, Kimberly-Clark has troubles of its own. The company
has been trying to break into the European market for disposable nappies
with its Huggies brand, but the cost of doing so has proved much higher than
expected - not least because of aggressive retaliatory action by Procter &amp;
Gamble. So the last thing Kimberly-Clark needs just now is a round of price
cuts in the US nappy market.
Mr Sherman Chao, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, remarks that all this is a far
cry from the early 1990s, when consumer product companies were enjoying a
fall in raw material costs and yet were still able to push up prices. 'Now
everything is converging against them - an inability to raise prices in
general and raw material prices moving up.' Seen in that light, it is
remarkable that Procter &amp; Gamble is doing as well as it is. But with the
nappy war moving to Europe, and the increase in pulp prices showing no signs
of slowing, no one is pretending that the diaper business is going to get
any easier.
