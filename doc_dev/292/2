   Kimberly-Clark swiped at least $300
million in sales from Procter &amp; Gamble by copying its design for
super-absorbent disposable diapers, a lawyer claimed.
   Attorney Allen Gerstein gave the estimate in closing arguments
in Procter &amp; Gamble's federal lawsuit against its biggest
competitor.
   The company claims the design of its super-absorbent Pampers was
copied by Kimberly-Clark in developing its super-absorbent Huggies.
Procter &amp; Gamble wants the judge to order a halt to Huggies
producton and have them removed from stores.
   But a lawyer for Kimberly-Clark said the company had no desire
to copy Pampers because early versions of that product leaked.
   ``Kimberly-Clark totally, independently developed its Huggies
super-trim diapers,'' said the attorney, V. Bryan Medlock Jr.
   Barring an out-of-court settlement, U.S. District Judge Falcon
Hawkins is expected to rule this summer in the non-jury case.
   Procter &amp; Gamble forecast sales of $300 million a year from
super-absorbent Pampers, Gerstein said. But sales were $150 million
below projections in both fiscal 1986-87 and the following year
after Kimberly-Clark introduced its super-absorbent Huggies, he
said.
   Industry experts say about $3.3 billion worth of disposable
diapers are produced each year. Procter &amp; Gamble is the industry
leader with about 47 percent of the market and Kimberly-Clark is
No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   The complaint does not seek specific monetary damages. If
Kimberly-Clark is found liable, damages would be determined in a
second proceeding.
   The closing arguments ended 17 days of testimony in the trial.
   The complaint by Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble says
researchers Paul Weisman and Steve Goldman developed a new way for
combining wood pulp fluff and super-absorbent materials to allow
disposable diapers to be made thinner.
   Kimberly-Clark violated the patented process in making its
super-absorbent Huggies, the complaint says.
   But Kimberly-Clark contends Procter &amp; Gamble never had a valid
patent because it provided misleading information to the U.S Patent
Office.
   The examining officer never would have issued a patent to
Procter &amp; Gamble if he had known about earlier work by an Italian
inventor, Medlock said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it test-marketed its new super-absorbent
Pampers in Wichita, Kan., in 1984 and then Kimberly-Clark copied
the design.
   Medlock also argued that Procter &amp; Gamble had not proven a link
between the invention and the success of the new products.
   ``There is no way to tell whether the success of these other
products is due to the Weisman-Goldman invention or other
inventions,'' Medlock added.
   But Gerstein said the Weisman-Goldman development ran contrary
to the thinking at the time that fluff and super-absorbent material
could not be combined in a diaper.
   ``Not one person, not one article, not one patent'' had shown
that it could be done, he said.
