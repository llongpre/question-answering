Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was
raising the prices of some of its tissue products in the US by up to 8 per
cent because of higher pulp prices, but simultaneously announced an 11 per
cent cut in the price of its Luvs disposable nappies.
The company also said it was turning Luvs into a unisex product instead of
having different types of nappy for each sex. It said the resulting cost
savings, combined with higher volumes flowing from the price cut, should
have a positive effect on profits.
Analysts say Luvs has about 13 per cent of the US disposable nappy market.
Pampers, another Procter &amp; Gamble product, has about 26 per cent,
Kimberly-Clark's Huggies about 30 per cent, and the rest is taken by private
label products.
While Pampers and Huggies vie for the top end of the market, Procter &amp;
Gamble has been repositioning Luvs as a direct competitor for private label
products by lowering its price. Yesterday's move was the latest in a series
of price reductions.
Procter &amp; Gamble also said it was cutting the price of Pampers by about 2
per cent. Analysts said this was to prevent the differential between Pampers
and Luvs becoming too wide. Kimberly-Clark is expected to follow suit
because Huggies and Pampers have for several years sold at virtually the
same price.
