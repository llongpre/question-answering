   A federal judge has ruled against
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in a patent dispute with Kimberly-Clark Corp.,
defeating the consumer products giant's bid for control of the $3
billion disposable-diaper market.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had charged that the Dallas-based manufacturer
of ``super-absorbent'' Huggies diapers with copying Procter &amp;
Gamble's design of ``super-absorbent'' Pampers.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, was seeking removal of
Huggies from store shelves and unspecified monetary damages.
   But U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins ruled Thursday that a
Procter &amp; Gamble patent for its super-absorbent diaper is
unenforceable because the company intended to deceive a patent
examiner.
   Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman Carol Boyd said the company planned
to appeal the decision.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is the leader in the disposable diaper
industry, with 47 percent of market. Kimberly-Clark is No. 2, with
about 30 percent of the market.
   At the heart of the lawsuit was a Procter &amp; Gamble patent to
combine wood pulp fluff and super-absorbent material to produce a
thinner diaper.
   After the application was rejected several times, Procter &amp;
Gamble was awarded a patent in 1985 based on new test data that
convinced a patent examiner the development was unique, the ruling
said.
   But Hawkins said Procter &amp; Gamble did not provide the U.S.
Patent Office with results of 1983 tests challenging the 1985 data
and the attorney handling the matter was ``grossly negligent'' for
failing to do so.
   ``The finding of intent to deceive is bolstered by the highly
material nature of the false affidavit,'' the judge said in his
58-page ruling.
   Procter &amp; Gamble attorneys argued during the 17-day, non-jury
trial that the firm lost $300 million a year because of the alleged
patent infringement by Kimberly-Clark. The trial ended May 31.
   Hawkins also ruled that an antitrust complaint filed by
Kimberly-Clark against Procter &amp; Gamble in a separate lawsuit may
proceed. That case is expected to go to trial in Charleston early
next year.
   Procter &amp; Gamble filed the lawsuit in South Carolina because
Kimberly-Clark operates a diaper manufacturing plant in the state.
