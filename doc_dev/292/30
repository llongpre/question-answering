   Leaders in the disposable diaper industry said
Wednesday that cloth competitors and consumer misunderstandings
likely accounted for recent survey results indicating strong
support for banning their product.
   ``It's not a simple issue of environment vs. paper diapers,''
said Scott Stewart, a spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   The roughly 16 billion disposable diapers sold every year have
become an environmental and health issue as local governments try
to deal with mountains of used, bacteria-laden dirty diapers and
rapidly filling landfills.
   Bans or taxes on disposable diapers are being considered in at
least 20 states. Nebraska, for example, has generally banned the
sale of new nondegradable diapers effective Oct. 1, 1993.
   A national Media General-Associated Press poll on environmental
concerns found that 71 percent of respondents supported a ban on
disposable diapers.
   In a recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll, respondents
favored a ban on disposable diapers by a 3-1 ratio. In a Gallup
Organization poll, 43 percent of respondents supported a ban, and
38 percent favored a tax.
   But Stewart said the criticism is misleading. He said disposable
diapers account for only about 1 percent of trash in the nation's
landfills.
   Furthermore, he said, cloth diapers were not necessarily
environmentally safer because they take more energy to make and
need water for cleaning.
   ``We don't get rattled about surveys because they don't tell us
anything we don't already know,'' Stewart said. ``Our competition _
the cloth diaper industry _ has been relatively successful in
painting this as an environmental problem.
   ``There's no dispute that disposables contribute to solid waste,
but it's a relatively small part, and it's unfair to say it is a
major contributor.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble says its Pampers and Luvs have about half of
the nation's $3.5 billion-a-year disposable diaper business. The
other major manufacturer is Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark Corp.,
which makes Huggies.
   Kimberly-Clark spokeswoman Jean Allen said it was unfair to
blame disposable diapers for all landfill problems. She said
consumers who used disposables simply weighed convenience against
environmental costs.
   ``If you were to ban disposable diapers and use cloth, you would
not come up with no environmental cost,'' she said. ``An individual
has to balance that cost. Water is a limited resource; there are
chemical and detergent wastes to be considered, and air pollution.
   ``This way the consumer has the right to weigh what they
consider the best alternative against the environmental cost.''
   Jack Mogavero, president of General Health Care Corp. of
Piscataway, N.J., said his company delivers nearly 2.9 million
cloth diapers a week in 14 states.
   ``I don't know anything about any poll, but I know what the
consensus of the people is, based on the number of customers we
serve weekly,'' Mogavero said by telephone. ``We've experienced
tremendous growth, and I have to attribute that to the ecology
issue.''
   Mogavero said his company processes cloth diapers for softening
and to inhibit bacteria growth.
   ``That, along with home delivery and the ecology issue, is
turning the business around,'' he said. ``I think the public is
extremely concerned with the ecology issue, not just diapers.''
   The National Association of Diaper Services estimated in October
that 750,000 households used cloth diaper services, a 38.5 percent
increase in a year.
   Some hospitals are switching to cloth after years of using
disposables.
   ``While well-intentioned, the perception that has driven that
decision is that disposables are an environmental hazard, and they
are not,'' Stewart said. Some small companies have developed
disposables they say are degradable, but neither of the big
producers have such plans. Both said actual disposal conditions
tended to limit any breakdown of a ``degradable'' diaper over time.
   ``At this time, we don't see the so-called biodegradable diaper
as a real solution,'' Ms. Allen said. ``Nothing degrades in a
landfill; to say a diaper degrades in a landfill is a marketing
claim. You can dig up a newspaper 25 years later and read it.''
