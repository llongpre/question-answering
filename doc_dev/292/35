<P>
Rorer Group Inc. today announced an alliance with Procter &amp; Gamble Co. to 
develop and market prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes one day after the suburban Philadelphia-based company announced 
a $1.7-billion agreement to merge operations with the pharmaceuticals 
operations of Rhone-Poulenc of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of today's joint venture, Procter &amp; Gamble will obtain 
exclusive U.S. marketing and distribution rights to Rorer's line of 
over-the-counter pharmaceuticals such as Maalox, Ascriptin and Perdiem. 
</P>
<P>
Rorer, which will continue to manufacture the drugs, will gain rights to 
develop and market De-Nol, an anti-ulcer drug, and other prescription 
gastrointestinal compounds that Procter &amp; Gamble has been developing. 
</P>
<P>
Rorer will retain ownership of its brands, while Procter &amp; Gamble will 
receive royalty payments for the prescription products. Both companies will 
share in the growth of the business.
