<HEAD>EC Asks Procter &amp; Gamble To Suspend Cooperation Deal With Finaf
SpA</HEAD>

   The European Community Commission asked
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. of the United States and Italy's Finaf SpA on
Tuesday to suspend a plan to cooperate on making diapers and other
personal hygienic products.
   The companies said in September they plan to create joint
ventures in Italy, Spain and Portugal for their paper products
businesses, notably diapers and sanitary napkins. Also, Procter
said it would buy all of Finaf's activities in Britain.
   The Commission asked the companies to hold off until it is
satisfied ``there is no breach'' of EC fair competition rules.
   A Commission official said the accord could create or strengthen
dominant positions by the two companies and received a complaint
about the planned venture from Peau Douce SA, a French diaper
maker.
   Peau Douce argued Procter's deal with Finaf would violate
competition rules and asked for interim measures to stop the
agreement from taking effect.
   The EC treaty bans undertakings that prevent, restrict or
distort fair copetition in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Finaf
have been in touch with the Commission since before they announced
plans for their linkup.
   David Veitch, a spokesman at Procter &amp; Gamble's European
headquarters here, said, ``It has always been our intention not to
implement this agreement until the competent authorities have been
heard.''
   The EC Commission official said discussions with the two
companies were continuing and if these ``go satisfactorily, we can
resolve the problem without going further to law.''
   Veitch said under the deal with Finaf, the two companies were
``to merge their paper product business'' in Italy, Spain and
Portugal.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Pampers, is a leading diaper
producer. But Veitch said the company ``was a relatively small
player in Europe'' in sanitary napkins and other personal hygiene
paper goods.
   ``The purpose of the agreement (with Finaf) was to accelerate
our entry'' into those products in Europe, he said.
