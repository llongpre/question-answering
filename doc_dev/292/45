   Noxell Corp., a major manufacturer of skin-care
products and cosmetics, will be merged into Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in
a $1.3 billion stock swap announced today.
   Noxell, based in Hunt Valley, Md., makes and sells Noxzema
skin-care products, Cover Girl cosmetics and Lestoil household
cleaner. The 75-year-old company has 2,200 employees, had $522
million in sales last year and markets in the United States, Canada
and Europe.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had worldwide sales of $21.4 billion last year,
making it one of the world's major consumer products companies. Its
vast array of brands includes Cheer and Tide detergents, Charmin
toilet paper, Duncan Hines baking products and Pampers disposable
diapers.
   P&amp;G said it will exchange, on a tax-free basis, 0.272 shares of
its common stock for each share of Noxell's stock. Based on
Thursday's closing price of P&amp;G stock of $121.87{, the transaction
would have a value of about $33.15 per Noxell share, company
officials said.
   Noxell soared $9.75 a share to $31 in early over-the-counter
trading today, while Procter &amp; Gamble was down $2 at $119.87{ a
share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The merger is subject to approval by Noxell Corp.'s shareholders
and federal regulators, led by the Federal Trade Commission.
Directors of both Noxell and Procter &amp; Gamble have unanimously
approved the merger, the companies said.
   The merger does not need approval by Procter &amp; Gamble
shareholders and should be completed by year's end, said P&amp;G
spokesman William Dobson. P&amp;G does not plan any immediate
significant changes, although some employees may end up being
relocated as the merger progresses, he said.
