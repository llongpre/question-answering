In a cramped neighborhood drugstore alongside a case of murky Oriental herb 
drinks sits a stack of large plastic packages bearing a face and logo familiar 
to millions of American parents.

"Pam-pahs," as they are called in Japan -- Pampers diapers to U.S. consumers -- 
are one of those increasingly common species in Japan: an American product that 
not only sells, but sells well. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when polls show Americans growing restive with the onslaught of 
Japanese products and money in the United States, a trend is starting in the 
other direction. 
</P>
<P>
While IBM and McDonald's are the best-known examples of American products that 
have made it in Japan, so too have Domino's Pizza (with the same 30-minute 
delivery guarantee); Schick razor blades; Oreo cookies; Kodak film; M&amp;Ms; 
Nike shoes; Levi's blue jeans; Microsoft computer software; Haagen-Dazs ice 
cream, and McIlhenney Co. Tabasco sauce, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola makes more money selling soft drinks in Japan, including its 
made-for-Japan canned coffee and Oolong tea, than in the United States, 
according to analysts here. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the companies will say it has been easy. In fact, some recently have 
chosen to bail out, deterred by the high cost of operating here and the long 
time it takes to get established. 
</P>
<P>
But even U.S. trade negotiators acknowledge that it can be done. A composite 
study of a successful foreign firm prepared by the U.S. Embassy and used in 
recent trade talks concluded that foreigners can make it here, but "government 
regulations, lack of antitrust enforcement and traditional business practices 
combined to make this an extremely difficult and costly process." 
</P>
<P>
Pampers' experience here shows what it involves. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 
maker of the diaper, created the Japanese market for disposable diapers in 1977 
and then nearly lost it to more creative Japanese competitors a few years 
later. Now, after a costly redesign of business practices and the product 
itself, Pampers has become the single best-selling brand again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a totally different ballgame here," said Ronald G. Pearce, president of 
Procter &amp; Gamble Far East Inc. "It has been a rough and rocky road. But 
today, after many years of hard and expensive learning, we are a factor here." 
</P>
<P>
When Pampers arrived in Japan in 1977, it was virtually the only disposable 
diaper on the market. Japanese mothers, eager to shed the mess of washing cloth 
diapers, snapped them up. Pampers dominated the market for the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But the diapers were imported without modification from the United States, and 
they were not quite suited to Japanese consumer needs. Made entirely of pulp, 
they were bulky, which made them difficult to transport and then store in tiny 
Japanese apartments, and they often leaked, making them a nuisance to use at 
night or on outings. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, meanwhile, did what Japanese companies have done for years 
when shown a promising new development: They modified it and made it better. 
Working to come up with a more compact and absorbent diaper more to the liking 
of Japanese mothers, Japanese companies developed super-absorbent polymers, 
basically powders that sop up liquid and turn it into a gel. Instead of ending 
up with a wet, leaky diaper after four hours of use, they made a diaper that, 
in the box, was half the size of Pampers and, on the baby, absorbed liquids, 
leaving the child dry and less prone to diaper rash. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a better mousetrap. It just revolutionized the industry, and P&amp;G 
didn't see it coming," said Joy Walbert, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, the Japanese diaper brands -- "Moonies" and "Merries" -- had 
swept the market. By 1983, "Pampers was virtually driven out of business," 
acknowledged Pearce. The competition combined with other problems in P&amp;G's 
Japanese operation, he said, and "we actually came very close to joining the 
ranks, along with hundreds of foreign companies, who have failed to enter the 
Japanese market successfully." 
</P>
<P>
Pearce declined to discuss the finances of Procter &amp; Gamble Far East. But 
it was clear by the mid-1980s that the company needed a major revamping, and 
not only in the diaper area. 
</P>
<P>
That meant better research about what Japan's quality-conscious consumers 
wanted. It also meant closer relationships with wholesalers and retailers, to 
make them feel part of the company and more loyal to the product. P&amp;G 
earlier had made inroads into Japan's complex distribution system; now it also 
began offering costly services unheard of in the United States but expected in 
Japan, such as 24-hour delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, though, it meant making a better product. In 1985, Procter 
&amp; Gamble came out with its own version of super-absorbent Pampers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so far behind, we just had to do it step by step," said Pearce. It was 
an expensive and time-consuming process of the sort that has convinced other 
foreign firms to not bother with the Japanese market. It also has produced a 
diaper that Americans living in Japan say is much softer and more compact -- 
better -- than U.S.-made Pampers. Today, according to Pearce, Pampers is the 
best-selling disposable diaper in Japan. Salomon's Walbert and other analysts 
estimate that it has about a 25% market share. P&amp;G has several other 
best-selling products here as well, including Japan's top-selling shampoo-rinse 
combination, a compact laundry detergent and, one of the hit products of the 
last year, Whisper sanitary napkins. According to Walbert, Whisper is so 
popular because P&amp;G did several years of market research, using test 
groups, and came up with a product tailored to the needs of Japanese women, 
such as having a wrapper that makes almost no noise when opened. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been that P&amp;G's Japanese sales now exceed $1 billion, and 
Japan probably will soon replace Germany as the company's largest foreign 
market. An added benefit, according to Walbert, is that P&amp;G's huge Japanese 
competitors are now so busy defending their flanks that they have little time 
to challenge P&amp;G in the United States and other markets. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce said he believes that the Japanese market is not as closed as many 
critics have suggested. A company succeeds in Japan if it is willing to adapt, 
both its product and its way of doing business, and is willing to accept that 
it takes time and money to get established here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view, it's different. We accepted those differences and 
found a way to break through," said Pearce. "You just can't roll out something 
here that worked in another country and expect it to sell." 
</P>
<P>
It can be a long and tiring process, he said, but "our experience has shown 
that the market was open enough for us to get in."

the marketplace. ; Photo, (A2) Making It in Japan: U.S. firms have made inroads
