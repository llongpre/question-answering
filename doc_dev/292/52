   MONTREAL -- After 15 years of hush-hush research, Johnson
&amp; Johnson is launching across Canada a new line of very thin
sanitary napkins with an absorbent core of processed peat
moss.
   J&amp;J claims that its peat moss pad provides the same
absorbency but is one-fifth as thick as standard sanitary
pads, which have a core of fluffed wood pulp. J&amp;J also claims
its peat pad is slightly thinner and performs better than
"ultra thin" pads that rely on superabsorbent polymers, a
technology that revolutionized the disposable-diaper market.
The superabsorbent polymers gel as they absorb liquid.

   J&amp;J won't say if or when its peat pad, named Sure &amp;
Natural Prima in Canada, will be introduced in the U.S. and
other markets. "At this point, we won't speculate about what
those plans might be," a J&amp;J spokesman said. Sure &amp; Natural
Prima is just now hitting store shelves here and J&amp;J hasn't
started advertising yet. J&amp;J also won't discuss other
possible uses for the processed peat moss, such as disposable
diapers, a market the company abandoned 10 years ago.
   Told of the peat pad, industry executives and analysts
were intrigued. "If they can really reduce thickness by
one-fifth with the same absorbency, wow, they're going
places," said an industry researcher who studies absorbent
materials. "You're kidding," a spokesman at a J&amp;J competitor
said.
   But analysts and executives said J&amp;J could have a tough
time marketing the product. The sphagnum, or peat moss, core
of Sure &amp; Natural Prima is visible through the pad's white
outer linings as a dark, rectangular middle layer. After
cutting the pad open, the curious will discover that the
processed moss is light brown, dry and crumbly.
   A manager at a company that makes private-label sanitary
pads and napkins said consumers may spurn the product because
of the dark middle layer. "I wouldn't buy a brown sanitary
napkin," said Bonita Austin, a Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
analyst, adding that getting consumers to try any new
sanitary pad is difficult. "This is the kind of product women
just don't want to take a risk on," she said.
   The industry scientist said that other researchers who
have studied peat moss found that bleaching it to increase
whiteness reduced absorbency. J&amp;J won't say much about its
peat process. The moss is "compressed into rolls or mats,"
the J&amp;J spokesman said, adding that it isn't bleached. He
declined to elaborate. He said the processed moss can absorb
20 times its weight in liquid. Sure &amp; Natural Prima is the
first commercial application of J&amp;J's patented peat moss
technology, which was developed by the company's
Montreal-based Canadian unit. J&amp;J is based in New Brunswick,
N.J.
   Acknowledging that it isn't easy to get women to try a new
pad and to convince them that a very thin pad will work, the
spokesman said J&amp;J plans extensive free sampling. He wouldn't
discuss the marketing plan in detail but said the main
selling points are highlighted on the Sure &amp; Natural Prima
box and in an enclosed pamphlet. "So thin, so close to
nothing," the box reads, promising "incredible protection."
   However, Sure &amp; Natural Prima's most innovative feature
isn't part of the sales pitch. The package doesn't mention
peat moss. The enclosed pamphlet says only that the "unique,
highly absorbent core {is} from nature." A woman calling
J&amp;J's Canadian consumer information line was told the
material is "natural." After asking twice what that meant,
she was finally told, "okay, it's sphagnum moss."
   Analysts said J&amp;J has been losing market share to Procter
&amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. in the key U.S. pad
market and needs a boost. Wertheim Schroder estimates
Kimberly-Clark has 30%; J&amp;J, 29%; and P&amp;G, 26%, of the U.S.
sanitary-pad market. Canadian market shares weren't
available. The U.S. market is worth $1.9 billion at retail
and the Canadian market, $235 million. The world-wide
sanitary-napkin market is estimated at $8 billion. Figures
don't include tampons.
   J&amp;J processes its moss at a mill in Desbiens, Quebec, a
small town 225 miles north of Montreal. The region is known
for blueberries and bogs. Quebec has abundant supplies of
peat moss.
