   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has agreed to sell its
Crush International beverage operations to Cadbury Schweppes PLC,
the British candy and beverage giant, for $220 million in cash, the
companies announced Thursday.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, a Cincinnati-based consumer products company
which operates worldwide, had been searching since May for a buyer
for the soft-drink line. The company purchased Crush in 1980 for
about $50 million and then bought Crush's Canadian operations in
1984 for an estimated $10 million.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it was selling the Crush unit to devote
more time and resources to other beverages, including Folgers
coffee, Citrus Hill juices and Sundor fruit juices and drinks.
Procter &amp; Gamble had $21.4 billion in worldwide sales in the fiscal
year ended June 30.
   P&amp;G's 290 worldwide Crush employees _ about 215 of those are in
the United States _ will be transferred to other positions within
Procter &amp; Gamble, company spokesman Donald Tassone said.
   The cash acquisition would give Cadbury the Crush brands in North
America, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. That
unit, which includes the Crush soft drinks and Hires root beer
labels, had sales of $71 million for the first half of this year.
   Combining Crush brands with Cadbury's existing drinks businesses
would give the company a 4.7 percent share of the U.S. soft drinks
market, up from 3.6 percent, Cadbury said. Its share of the Canadian
market will jump to 15.1 percent from 10.8 percent, it said.
   Thursday's announcement was accompanied by a report that
Cadbury's net income rose 16 percent for the first six months of
1989, to $97.8 million from $84.5 million. Sales totaled $1.86
billion, up 11 percent from $1.67 billion in 1988.
   Last year's results included a one-time gain of $47.08 million
from the sale of part of Cadbury's investment in the U.S. soft
drinks concern Dr. Pepper.
