   Bachelors David Pitassi and Wally Klemp don't
have babies. But they're covering the bottoms of infants with a
disposable diaper they say is cheaper and better than the
better-known competition.
   Move over Pampers, Luvs and Huggies, the diaper entrepreneurs
say. Here come Drypers.
   The four-size, patent-pending diaper has what their company
calls a ``double lock-away core'' that absorbs moisture and wicks
it from the baby's skin. The core is made of paper fluff and two
parallel bands of super-absorbent material that can soak up to 100
times its weight in liquid.
   Unlike the his-and-hers diapers that have a more absorbent
material in the front and bottom, the Dryper core runs down the
middle of the entire diaper, making it applicable for both girls
and boys, Klemp says.
   ``We think our product has better features,'' says Pitassi.
   He and Klemp and a third partner, Terry Tognietti, began
marketing Drypers last summer, and they debuted on Houston grocery
shelves in September.
   Sales are exceeding expectations, the company claims. It's
reporting monthly sales of about $1 million and has captured 12
percent to 20 percent of the market in cities where Drypers are
sold.
   Although that's more than Veragon hoped for, it remains well
below the dominance of Procter &amp; Gamble Co., maker of Pampers and
Luvs, and Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies. So Veragon's
founders are happy but reserved.
   ``We don't want to grow faster than we can control,'' Klemp
says. Production at a new Houston plant already is running 24 hours
a day, seven days a week to fill orders for New Orleans and all of
Texas.
   The $3.3 billion national diaper business is not new to the
Veragon partners.
   Pitassi and Klemp, both 30, formed a diaper company, VMG
Products, in Vancouver, Wash., in 1984.
   ``I was working for Procter &amp; Gamble selling diapers and saw the
diaper business was growing. The country was going through a baby
boom. It just represented a tremendous opportunity,'' Pitassi
recalld.
   ``For us you had two big groups (Procter &amp; Gamble and
Kimberly-Clark) and here we had come along with the same quality,
if not better, diaper for a better price,'' he says.
   VMG, now the third-largest diaper maker, grossed millions months
after production began. Within a year, however, the two lost
control of the operation in a hostile takeover. They ventured out
on their own again.
   Tognietti, 31, learned the diaper business during nine years
with Procter &amp; Gamble _ which introduced disposable diapers in 1961
with Pampers _ and helped design P&amp;G's gender-specialized Luvs
diapers.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble is the nation's largest
producer of disposable diapers, claiming 47 percent of market.
Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark is No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   The top two are locked in a court battle. Procter &amp; Gamble is
suing its main competitor for patent infringement, accusing
Kimberly-Clark of copying the design of its highly successful
super-absorbent Pampers for use in super-absorbent Huggies.
   Pitassi says selling Drypers close to the factory saves the
company transportation costs and enables Veragon to charge an
average of $1 less per box of diapers than the competition.
   Veragon picked Houston as its manufacturing center over six
other Southwest cities, partly because of tax abatements and ardent
wooing by the Houston Economic Development Council.
   The heart of the company's 80,500-square-foot headquarters is a
$2 million diaper-assembly machine that combines 15 raw materials.
The machine, dubbed ``Drypers One'' churns out 350 diapers a minute.
   The company eventually may diversify and produce other paper
products, but for now, Drypers is the main focus.
   ``No question _ our baby is Drypers,'' Klemp says.
