Leading nappy makers are battling for supremacy with a product aimed at
toddlers

It is not a pair of underpants. It is not a nappy. The disposable trainer
pant is a crafty cross between the two. It is also very big business.
In the past few weeks the world's foremost nappy makers have converged on
the UK in a battle for supremacy in this new market. Procter &amp; Gamble,
Kimberly-Clark and Peaudouce are spending several million pounds apiece in
an effort to become number one with the 800,000 British toddlers who are
potty trained each year.
The disposable trainer pant is the result of years of research by teams of
potty training experts. The parent is assured that there will be no messy
accidents as the pants are as absorbent as nappies. The child can enjoy the
independence of being able to pull the pants up and down. And the
manufacturer can look forward to higher sales: the pants cost more than
nappies, so that if they are used as substitutes sales increase, and if they
are used instead of ordinary pants, sales go up further still.
Parents in the US have been been buying these nappy hybrids for four years
and now spend about Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) a year on them. While there
is little further growth in the US market, the potty training market in the
UK has great potential. On some industry estimates it could be more than 10
per cent of the disposable nappy market, which last year was worth Pounds
420m.
The new product comes at a critical time for makers of disposable nappies.
Sales have grown faster than almost any other consumer product in the past
decade, but with about 9m nappies sold in Britain every day, the market is
now saturated. Last year volumes grew by only 3 per cent and may soon start
to decline as ecology minded parents reconsider whether terry nappies might
not be better after all.
The disposable pant is the manufacturers latest attempt to fight back. For
years they concentrated on making the product increasingly sophisticated,
with different kinds for boys and girls, new slim-line versions and a
proliferation of different sizes. With the trainer pant they are attempting
to increase the total size of the market. The hope is that parents and
children will like the pants so much that they will be in less of a hurry to
move into real underpants.
To capture the market, each of the three players has produced a similar
product, selling for a similar price, launched with a remarkably similar
marketing campaign. Yet the position each starts from is markedly different.
Proctor and Gamble starts from a position of strength as its Pampers brand
has about 70 per cent of the British disposable nappy market, giving the new
Pampers Trainers a head start. Kimberly-Clark sells no nappies in the UK,
although its Huggies Pull-Ups dominate the US market. Peaudouce, which is
marketing under the Up and Go brand name, has neither advantage, but it is
hoping to rely on a unique selling point of its product - an elasticated
waistband.
All three companies are concentrating on television advertising and on
direct mail. Each has a database of parents with children of potty training
age and has started bombarding them with potty training advice, samples and
vouchers. Over the past few weeks the offerings from Pampers and
Kimberly-Clark have gone out: both containing free samples and literature
that makes one wonder how anyone ever managed to get their children out of
nappies without the help of the disposable training pant.
Both come in different models for boys and girls: dinosaurs for boys and
teddies for girls on Pampers Trainers and engines for boys and animals for
girls on Huggies. The Pampers publicity pack includes a set of
potty-training accessories: a sticker for the potty, a cute wall chart to
mark achievements such as 'I can poo in my potty', and little medals to be
awarded for potty triumphs. It also includes a pamphlet written by a
specialist giving advice on how best to potty train children.
Not to be outdone, Huggies promises a free potty training book with the
first purchase. Peaudouce, which has been a little late off the mark, is
planning a Pounds 3m campaign to launch Up and Go this autumn.
This will concentrate on the fact that its nappies have an elasticated
waistband, which apparently make them less likely to sag when full.
All products are roughly the same price (Pounds 7 for 25 pants, compared
with Pounds 7 for about 40 nappies); Huggies and Up and Go come in various
sizes, whereas Pampers Trainers are in just one size.
The battle is particularly intense as all three players know that there is
unlikely to be room in the market for all of them. In the US the success of
Kimberly-Clark has left no space for anyone else. The sheer bulk of the
product means that supermarkets will not want to stock more than one of the
brands. Retailers already have enough trouble displaying Pampers and
own-brand nappies, as each comes in at least four different sizes and two
sexes.
Other nappy manufacturers are looking on in amazement as the big three pour
millions of pounds into the new market. Dave Hall, marketing manger at
Swaddlers, which makes nappies under the Togs brand name, is sceptical about
their chances of success. 'Our market research suggests people perceive
trainer pants as having a limited use. Parents who are potty training may
just go for it and take nappies off totally,' he says.
Careful trial marketing by Pampers and Peaudouce in the Netherlands and
Ireland over the past few months suggests that parents in Europe will pay
the extra for nappies that pull up and down. But whether they actually help
potty train is a moot point.
The Japanese, who potty train their children earlier than their European and
US counterparts, would not be too impressed by the new offerings. They have
been selling disposable training pants for years, but theirs are specially
designed so that the child is uncomfortable when wet, and is trained faster.
Children wearing the western version may be in them for years. But perhaps
that is the general idea.
