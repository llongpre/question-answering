Two years ago, Placentia businessman Bob Chickering was looking for ways to 
expand beyond the tiny business of selling cotton swabs when he discovered the 
disposable diaper. It looked like a good business, and one of his researchers 
owned some useful patents. 
</P>
<P>
But Chickering saw that the environmental problems posed by plastics were a 
threat to disposable diapers, and it was also crucial to avoid competing 
head-to-head with the powerful masters of the $3.5-billion industry, Procter 
&amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberley-Clark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed to be an elegant solution to both problems: a biodegradable diaper 
that would disintegrate after it was thrown away. It seemed one could be made 
using a cornstarch-laced plastic resin that had been available for years, and 
it could be niche-marketed to the tree-hugging set. 
</P>
<P>
Chickering's company, American Enviro Products, began marketing Bunnies as an 
environmentally sound diaper last July and had sold 40 million by the end of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Chickering finds himself embroiled in a heated national debate over 
whether biodegradable plastics -- which are also used in some plastic bags and 
other packaging products -- are part of the solution to the waste-disposal 
crisis, or part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
It's a debate that has produced some strange bedfellows: environmental groups 
have joined with Procter &amp; Gamble in calling biodegradable plastics a 
fraud, while a hodgepodge of plastics vendors and agribusiness firms have 
suddenly begun preaching the need for urgent action on the garbage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And a seemingly straightforward question of science -- do these plastics 
biodegrade, or not -- has been buried beneath the complicated politics of 
environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
Using biodegradable products is "the difference between doing something and 
doing nothing," proclaims the National Corn Growers Assn., a powerful supporter 
of cornstarch-enhanced plastic, in full-page ads in USA Today. But the 
Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental groups counter that even if 
the plastics do biodegrade, they will only inhibit efforts to cut down on the 
growing mountains of solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
Chickering, a genial man who doesn't pretend to understand the complicated 
chemistry of bio-degradability, concedes that biodegradability isn't a 
cure-all. "It's not a simple issue, but we're very comfortable with the 
technology," he said. "The research shows that cornstarch-based plastics break 
down faster than any other." 
</P>
<P>
Rmed International, a tiny company based in Sedona, Ariz., that markets its 
Tendercare diapers in health-food stores and by mail-order, is far less modest. 
The firm asserts unequivocally in its product literature that its plastic -- 
which is produced by the giant agriculture company Archer-Daniel-Midland -- 
"will break down completely into carbon dioxide and water in U.S. landfills." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of biodegradables, such as Environmental Defense Fund senior 
scientist Richard Denison, say that is nonsense. "Even materials that are 
readily degradable don't degrade in landfills, where there's very little 
moisture or oxygen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, efforts to prevent landfills from contaminating the air and ground 
water have resulted in new designs that effectively entomb the garbage and 
prevent degradability, sanitation experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Denison also asserted that even if the plastics do degrade, they can release 
toxic materials -- such as cadmium and lead -- that are used to color the 
plastics. And even under ideal conditions, critics contend that the 
cornstarch-based plastics simply break down into tiny particles. The cornstarch 
is eaten away so the plastic appears to disintegrate, but the rugged plastic 
polymer molecules remain in the environment to be eaten by unsuspecting fish 
and fowl, Denison and others maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Gialiana Tesoro, a professor of polymer chemistry at Polytechnic University of 
New York, said the claim of a complete breakdown of the plastic is "incomplete 
and misleading," if not an outright lie. "Every organic material will 
ultimately degrade," she noted, adding that all plastics are made from 
petroleum products, which are organic materials. But the speed at which that 
happens depends on the specific composition of the plastic and the 
environmental conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely complicated issue," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many scientists say there is not yet a definitive answer to the 
question of whether biodegradable plastics really break down completely, and 
under what circumstances. The Federal Trade Commission and the California 
attorney general's office, which have opened investigations into the validity 
of advertising claims about biodegradability, are wading through contradictory 
studies on the matter, and many more studies are in the works. The final answer 
may be still be some years off. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it is probably safe to say the biodegradable products break 
down somewhat faster than regular plastics, and they break into invisible 
pieces fairly quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But, environmentalists maintain, the use of biodegradable plastics also gets in 
the way of sound waste-reduction policies. That's because they give people the 
illusion that they are doing something about the plastic problem, when the real 
solution lies in reducing the use of plastic altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional cotton cloth diapers, for one, are an obvious alternative for the 
environmentally conscious, though they have to be made and cleaned and thus 
have some negative environmental effects of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Disposable diapers, which are made mostly of a (degradable) wood-pulp absorbent 
wrapped in a plastic back sheet, are believed to account for 1% to 2% of all 
the solid waste in U.S. landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"All plastics represent the throwaway ethic," said David Tam, solid waste 
chairman for the Bay chapter of the Sierra Club. "We believe in reusable 
products." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, biodegradable plastics are incompatible with existing plastic 
recycling methods, and thus they could impede ongoing efforts to massively 
increase the amount of plastic that is recycled. 
</P>
<P>
"This will threaten the entire recycling approach," said Randall Curlee, an 
economist and waste specialist at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. "I don't 
regard biodegradables as part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, plastic recycling is hardly widespread at the moment, and 
biodegradable proponents claim with some justification that there is no reason 
in principle that recycling processes can't be adjusted to accept biodegradable 
products. Tim Draeger, spokesman of the National Corn Growers Assn., also 
points out that "trying to recycle diapers is not a practical option" because 
of the human waste mixed in with the plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of biodegradable plastics are fighting the environmentalist 
offensive on a number of fronts. They've commissioned more studies on how fast 
the cornstarch-based plastics break down, supported trial efforts to dispose of 
them by composting, developed a common standard for what constitutes a 
recyclable plastic, and advertised the contribution they claim that the 
plastics can make to the solid waste problem. 
</P>
<P>
But their most convincing argument is one which relates not to the current 
products, but to future ones. Draeger calls the current biodegradable products 
the "Model T" of starch-based plastics, with new and even more degradable 
products to come. Indeed, the New Jersey consumer products firm Warner-Lambert 
recently announced that it had developed a plastic that could be made entirely 
from starch. 
</P>
<P>
A product of that sort would indeed satisfy many of the objections to 
biodegradable products now on the market, and Warner-Lambert's announcement was 
lauded by environmentalists. But for Chickering and some of his fellow 
entrepreneurs, such developments are a mixed blessing. The big consumer 
products concerns will almost certainly get into the "green" product game with 
such a material, and that would undercut part of the reasoning that prompted 
American Enviro Products to use biodegradables. 
</P>
<P>
The success of companies like American Enviro "is going to be short-lived," 
predicted Bonita Austen, a consumer products analyst with the investment bank 
Wertheim Schroeder. When Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark -- which 
Austen said control 49% and 31%, respectively, of the diaper market -- find a 
fully degradable plastic that can make good diapers, they will market the 
products heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll make it tough to compete," said Austen.
