   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Wednesday its
first quarter earnings slipped 1.6 percent from results a year ago
that included a big settlement in a legal fight over a cookie
patent.
   The consumer products giant earned $555 million, or $1.57 a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $564
million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier.
   Procter &amp; Gamble won the $125 million settlement - $81 million
after taxes - from a lawsuit it filed alleging that competitors
Frito-Lay, Nabisco and Keebler had infringed on P&amp;G's patent for
Duncan Hines ready-to-serve cookies.
   Excluding the settlement, earnings for the July-September period
in 1989 were $483 million, or $1.36 a share.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it had $6.65 billion in first quarter
sales worldwide, up 16.3 percent from $5.7 million a year earlier.
   Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said he was pleased that unit volume and
earnings excluding the settlement have ``continued to grow at a
dopuble-digit pace despite the uncertain times in which we are
operating.''
   The company said it had restated its July-September 1989
financial results to include operations of Noxell Corp., the
personal-care products maker based in Hunt Valley, Md., which P&amp;G
absorbed in November 1989.
