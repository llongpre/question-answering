   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., a Cincinnati-based consumer products concern, said its Venezuelan subsidiary would own 50% of a proposed joint venture with Industrias Mammi C.A., a personal-care products concern based in Caracas. 

   Financial details weren't disclosed, and a P&amp;G spokeswoman declined to say whether the joint venture would make any P&amp;G products. 
Mammi, which has about 500 employees, makes and markets Venezuela's leading disposable-diaper brand, as well as feminine-protection products and other baby related items. 

   P&amp;G said its Venezuelan subsidiary began operations in 1950 and has about 1,000 employees.
