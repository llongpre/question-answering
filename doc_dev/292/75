   Persian Gulf war rumors raced through the
financial world, pushing oil prices toward $29 a barrel and sending
more jolts through markets for U.S. stocks and bonds.
   Increasing indications of a possible Iraq-U.S. showdown in the
vital oil-producing region transfixed professional investors and
speculators through most of the day Tuesday and made many markets
seesaw without warning.
   Each suggestion of a conflict sent oil prices higher and stocks
and bonds lower on the theory that a fresh blanket of oil-shock
inflation would wallop the already weak U.S. economy. Conversely,
rumors that the situation was easing weakened oil prices and sent
money back into the stock and bond markets.

   Gasoline prices at the pump hit nearly five-year
highs, truckers sought freight rate increases and utilities warned
of inflated electric bills as the impact of soaring oil prices
widened.
   Economists said Tuesday that the uncertain future of the Middle
East's oil fields goes beyond the gas pump _ it could hit American
consumers in higher prices for products from frozen foods and
fertilizer to car tires and aluminum foil.
   Self-service unleaded gasoline rose 1.5 cents overnight to
$1.201 per gallon Tuesday, the highest price since the last week of
1985, the American Automobile Association said in a survey of 1,400
stations nationwide.

   Americans took out $463 million more in
consumer credit than they paid off in June, the government said,
but the borrowing pace fell well below that of May.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday consumer credit edged up
just 0.8 percent at an annual rate following a 6.1 percent gain, or
$3.65 billion, in May.
   Many analysts have been concerned recently over the caution
displayed by consumers, who have fueled an economic expansion that
would reach its eighth anniversary in November. Consumers represent
about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.

   With an expired contract
looming, representatives of Western Union Corp. and 2,500 union
workers planned to resume stalled negotiations.

America, reported progress Tuesday on a wage agreement but said the
company had not yielded on demands that medical benefits be
reduced, job categories be consolidated and the number of part-time
employees be increased.
   A two-year contract between employees and the giant telegram
company expired Monday, but workers decided to return to the
bargaining table rather than strike.

rights to Maalox.

the proposed agreement between Procter &amp; Gamble and Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer Inc., which makes Maalox, would lessen competition in the
