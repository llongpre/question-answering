   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Wednesday it is
entering a joint venture to make and sell personal care products in
China, the world's most populous country.
   The consumer products giant said it has entered a joint venture
with three China-based organizations to produce and sell products
including dishwashing detergents, shampoo, bath foam and other
personal-care goods.
   Edwin L. Artzt, president of P&amp;G International and vice chairman
of the company's board of directors, signed the agreement Wednesday
for Procter &amp; Gamble, the company announced. He said it represents
a long-term commitment to doing business in China.
   P&amp;G officials said the joint venture will greatly expand
distribution of the company's products in China. Procter &amp; Gamble
is to provide technical and management expertise to the venture.
   P&amp;G officials declined to say how much of a profit they expect
the joint venture will produce for the company.
   Until now, Procter &amp; Gamble products sold in China have been
imported into the country in small quantities, through so-called
``friendship stores'' established to serve foreign visitors.
   P&amp;G said it and a Hong Kong-based company, Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., reached agreement with Guangzhou Soap Factory and the
Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development District's import
and export corporation to form the joint venture company in
Guangzhou, a large city in southern China.
   The new company will be called Procter &amp; Gamble (Guangzhou) Ltd.
It will begin making products in China by October, officials said.
   The initial product lineup will include Guangzhou's factory
brands of shampoo, bath foam and dishwashing detergents, along with
some well-known P&amp;G products. Most of these products will be sold
in China, but some will be exported, officials said in making the
announcement in Cincinnati and Guangzhou.
   P&amp;G's international trade is the fastest-growing segment of its
business. International sales accounted for about one-third of
P&amp;G's $17 billion in total worldwide sales last year.
   ``Procter &amp; Gamble is committed to providing products of
superior quality and value that best fill the needs of the world's
consumers. We look forward to playing an important role in meeting
the growing demand for these types of products in China, and in
sharing our business experience and advanced technology with our
new partners,'' Artzt said.
   The agreement resulted from three years of negotiations, Procter
&amp; Gamble spokesman Don Tassone said. P&amp;G prepared for the venture
by advertising its products on Chinese television for 18 months,
from 1985 through early 1987.
   ``That was an effort to introduce our company and some of our
leading brands to the people of the country,'' Tassone said.
