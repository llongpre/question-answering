   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer Inc., facing an antitrust challenge to a joint marketing
plan, said Thursday they cancelled the agreement to avoid a legal
dispute.
   The plan to cooperate in the over-the-counter drug market would
have given P&amp;G, which makes the Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy,
exclusive rights to sell Rorer's Maalox antacid.
   The Justice Department announced a lawsuit Aug. 7 challenging
the arrangement on grounds it would reduce competition and raise
prices in the stomach remedy market.
   Randy Thurman, group president of RPR pharmaceuticals, said the
companies were confident the arrangement would survive U.S.
Department of Justice legal challenges.
   However, ``we weighed the risks of an extended court process to
RPR's consumer business, our employees and our customers and, on
balance, chose to terminate the agreement,'' Thurman said in a
statement from Rhone-Poulenc's headquarters in Fort Washington, Pa.
   Thurman said failing to close the agreement with P&amp;G could
reduce pre-tax earnings $30 million because of lost revenue from
inventory transfers.
   ``We are convinced that this alliance would have enhanced the
level of competition in the U.S. and been of value to consumers,''
P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc said in a joint statement.
   The agreement, announced March 13, had not taken effect, pending
government review.
   According to the Justice Department, the $236 million in
combined sales by P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc in the over-the-counter
stomach remedy market make up 26 percent of the $900 million market.
   P&amp;G reported worldwide sales of $24 billion for the year ending
June 30. Rhone-Poulenc reported sales of $3 billion.
