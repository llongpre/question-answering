   Syntex Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said they reached an agreement in principle to form a joint venture that will market non-prescription drug products. 

   The new company, to be owned 50-50 by the two companies, probably will market an over-the-counter version of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Syntex's anti-arthritis drug, naprosyn. 
The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing an application by Syntex, a health care concern, to market naprosyn without a physician's prescription. 

   Although the preliminary agreement only covers the marketing of pain-relievers and anti-inflammation drugs, Syntex and Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble, a consumer products company, said they are also holding "broad-ranging discussions regarding further collaboration."
