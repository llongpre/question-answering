Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has won approval from a US
court to continue its aggressive attack on the Dollars 2.4bn-a-year US
market for painkillers. A district court judge in New Jersey ruled that
Procter &amp; Gamble was not engaged in misleading advertising for its new
non-prescription pain-reliever, called Aleve. Procter &amp; Gamble entered the
market for pain-relievers in June this year in partnership with Syntex, a US
drug company. It accompanied the launch of Aleve, an over-the-counter
version of the drug naproxen, with television advertisements suggesting that
the product was more effective than established products - notably Advil, an
ibuprofen-based pain reliever made by another US drug company, American Home
Products.
In August American Home Products filed a lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble
and Syntex seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the Aleve
advertisements, claiming they were misleading consumers with 'unwarranted
and unsubstantiated' claims. Among the most serious, it said, was the
suggestion that Aleve lasted longer than Advil because the dosing interval
was longer. Procter &amp; Gamble stood by its claims, and on Tuesday, a US
district court ruled that American Home Products had failed to prove that
the advertisements were false or misleading. Procter &amp; Gamble said yesterday
that it was 'pleased, though frankly not surprised' by the ruling. American
Home Products had no comment.
