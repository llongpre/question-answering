   Two descendants of a founder of Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. said Monday they want stop the giant company from buying
coffee grown in El Salvador in an effort to end that country's
civil war.
   ``The coffee growers benefit from the war,'' James Gamble said
at a news conference here. ``It produces ... a very cheap labor
force that cannot organize because of the civil strife.''
   But James Gamble and his brother Robert admit they have little
chance of winning their proxy fight at the company's stockholder
Oct. 9 meeting in Cincinnati.
   ``It was an accomplishment for us to get the resolution
officially on the ballot,'' James Gamble said. ``We don't have an
illusion of actually winning the vote, but if we're able to win 3
percent this year then the resolution stays on the ballot for next
year.''
   Salvadoran beans make up about 2 percent of the coffee used to
produce Procter &amp; Gamble's Folgers coffee.
   ``We could very easily replace the Salvadoran coffee with coffee
beans from other countries, but this isn't an economic decision for
us,'' said company spokesman Donald Tassone.
   ``As a company, we can't let a very small but vocal group inject
us into their dispute with the U.S. government, no matter how
well-intentioned it might be,'' he said.
   The White House has asked Procter &amp; Gamble to continue buying
the beans because of the importance of coffee sales to the
Salvadoran economy.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu called a 10-month-old
consumer boycott of some coffee that uses Salvadoran beans -
including Folgers - a ``misguided attempt to cripple the Salvadoran
economy'' that will ``do nothing to advance the peace process,
democracy or human rights.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble calls the conflict a dispute between peace
activists and U.S. foreign policy and would prefer not to get
involved.
   In a position paper distributed to shareholders, the company
noted that El Salvador's Roman Catholic bishops oppose the coffee
boycott because lost sales would hurt farmers and workers.
   James Gamble said Salvadoran landowners would be likely to
pressure their government to negotiate for peace if their sales to
a major client were on the line.
   The corporation, he said, ``could play a very critical role in
speeding up the negotiation process.''
   There is a total of 346,425,304 voting shares in Procter &amp;
Gamble - James Gamble, 27, owns 24,806 shares worth about $2
million; Robert Gamble, 30, said he wasn't sure how many shares he
controls.
   Both brothers said they had the support of their father and
other family members.
   They wouldn't say how much stock owned by other family members
would be voting their way next week, but conceded it would be less
than 1 percent of the total.
