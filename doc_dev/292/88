   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. reported a 13% rise in its fiscal third-quarter net income, generally matching industry analysts' estimates that had been lowered in recent weeks. 

   Projecting small increases in unit-sales volume, some analysts had lowered earnings estimates by several cents a share. 
But several analysts were still surprised by the sales figures released Friday. 
And their views were mixed on whether the figures suggest a slowdown of the expensive market battles that have raged in P&amp;G's biggest product areas. 

   The households-goods company said profit increased to $188 million, or $1.10 a share, from $167 million, or 98 cents a share, in the quarter that ended March 31. 
As expected, the increase in net income was damped by a higher tax rate because of the loss of investment-tax credits under the new tax laws. 

   Analysts said gross profit margins continue to improve. 
But those who had projected increases in pre-tax profit of about 22% to 25% were somewhat disappointed with the 20% increase to $339 million from $284 million. 

   Sales rose 3% in the quarter, to $4.22 billion from $4.08 billion, an increase analysts attributed almost entirely to currency changes, rather than unit volume or price increases. 
P&amp;G, which declined to comment, gets roughly 30% of its sales overseas. 

   The sales figures may in part reflect the tough comparison against a year earlier, when the company's recovery of market shares in big categories such as diapers, toothpaste and detergent was peaking. 

   Some analysts said the figures suggest P&amp;G hasn't been able to impose or maintain enough price increases on some products that have been the focus of intense competition for several years. 

   Investors have hoped P&amp;G and competitors would be able to raise prices and slow advertising and promotion spending. 
One analyst said much of the company's stock price increase has been based on such a scenario. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, P&amp;G shares closed at $86.75, down $1.75. 

   "But the (marketing) spending cycle goes on and on," said Joseph Kozloff of PaineWebber Inc. 
"The detergent wars are raging," he said. 
Unilever Group's Lever Bros. unit's Surf detergent, for example, has continued to make inroads against P&amp;G products such as Tide and Dash, although increased sales of Liquid Tide have helped P&amp;G's total category share remain constant, said Jack Salzman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 

   And P&amp;G has seen erosion of its share of the diaper market, though it retains the powerful lead it picked up in recent years, after a slump in the first half of the 1980s. 
Kimberly-Clark Co.'s Huggies diapers have taken business from P&amp;G's Luvs, dropping the company's total share, including Pampers, to about 52% from 56% or 57% a year earlier, according to market estimates. 

   P&amp;G confirmed that its new Luvs Deluxe diapers, designed to regain market share, will be on store shelves nationally in May. 
But some analysts don't think it will be worth the effort. 
"Any way you slice it, there's three diapers in a two-diaper market," said Mr. Salzman. "(Luvs) is superfluous." 

   On the brighter side, Hercules Segalas of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said Kimberly-Clark recently followed P&amp;G in raising prices on super-absorbent diapers a hefty 7%. 
That increase, coupled with declining material costs, will give both companies higher profits. 
And he said he expects P&amp;G to be able to raise other prices in the current quarter. 

   Jay H. Freedman, of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., also sees the competitive situation improving. 
"Sure there are selective areas that are competitive," he acknowledged. 
"But the worst is over." 
He cited product areas, such as fabric softeners, that have seen "a huge return of profitability." 

   And he said that, after several years of jockeying for position, P&amp;G and Lever have settled into their positions "in this oligopolistic market," adding "P&amp;G continues to dominate and Lever is entrenched as No. 2." 
He doesn't think they have to "beat each other up for incremental market shares." 

   While prices may seem flat overall, declines in coffee prices, for example, obscure increases elsewhere, Mr. Freedman added. 

   Messrs. 
Freedman and Segalas also pointed to the first drop seen in many years in the volume and value of coupons. 

   For the nine months of fiscal 1987, P&amp;G reported profit of $651 million, or $3.82 a share, up 12% from $582 million, or $3.46 a share, a year earlier. 
Sales increased 11%, to $12.83 billion from $11.55 billion.
