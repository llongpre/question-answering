In politics, community groups fighting projects such as landfills and toxic 
dumps are said to be operating on the NIMBY principle -- Not in My Back Yard. 
</P>
<P>
So it was with tongue in cheek that a lobbyist for Huggies diapers this week 
suggested that opposition to a measure requiring environmental warnings on 
disposable diapers was fueled by a similar desire -- Not Until Mine Is Potty 
Trained. 
</P>
<P>
That, along with conflicting claims, led the powerful Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee on Tuesday to kill a controversial diaper bill sponsored by Sen. Lucy 
Killea (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Under Killea's proposal, companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and 
Kimberly-Clark would have been required to put stickers on packages of their 
disposables by January, 1992, saying, "Environmental warning: Single-use 
disposable diapers create significant environmental problems and costs to the 
community when disposed." 
</P>
<P>
But the committee scuttled that plan with an 8-6 vote after a heavy lobbying 
campaign from the industry, which offered economic and environmental 
counterclaims. The measure needed 12 votes to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said Wednesday she has decided to declare a public information victory 
while beating a legislative retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, the strong opposition gave us a lot more publicity on this very 
simple, innocuous bill," said Killea, adding she will not try to revive the 
bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said some parents have approached her to say they intend to switch to 
cloth diapers. It is the kind of ecologically motivated behavior that Killea 
says she wanted all along with the labels, since the non-biodegradable 
throwaways constitute about 2% of the solid wastes packed into landfills each 
year -- a volume large enough to create a 10-foot-wide strip on Interstate 5 
from Mexico to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Disposable-diaper companies, however, said the 2% was not enough to warrant a 
label that singled out their product as an environmental hazard. "The whole 
objective is to put a user of the product on a guilt trip," said Gene Hill, 
Kimberly-Clark's regional director of state government relations. 
</P>
<P>
Killea has a second bill that would require day care centers to give parents 
the option of using either cloth or disposable diapers. That bill is still 
wending its way through the legislative process.
