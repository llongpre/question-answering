   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., pressured by a boycott of its
Folgers brand, is developing a new blend of coffee that
doesn't contain coffee beans from El Salvador.
   P&amp;G said the new coffee will be sold under its Maryland
Club label and should be available next month to restaurants
and other food-service customers. But it has no plans to sell
the new blend in stores.

   In another move to appease critics, P&amp;G agreed to change
its diaper advertisements in 10 states. The company will no
longer claim that the disposables are easily made into
compost. The agreement follows an investigation into
deceptive environmental claims in ads for Pampers and Luvs
diapers. P&amp;G had claimed that the diapers could break down to
a soil-like substance in just 90 days, but attorneys general
in 10 states said the claim was misleading.
   While P&amp;G's diapers have been targeted by
environmentalists, its Folgers coffee, a top U.S. brand, has
been the focus of a two-year boycott because about 2% of its
beans are imported from El Salvador. Activists, including the
group Neighbor to Neighbor in San Francisco, want companies
to stop buying products from the wartorn country.
   PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried
Chicken units serve Folgers in those restaurants, but will
test the new blend in response to the boycott, according to
spokesmen for the chains.
   P&amp;G disclosed its plans in a recent letter to customers
concerned about the boycott's impact on business. Richard L.
Francis, who heads P&amp;G's food-service and lodging products
division, told officials at Pizza Hut that P&amp;G is "in the
process of developing a coffee blend that parallels the
Folgers flavor profile but contains no Salvadoran beans."
   But a P&amp;G spokesman said the company isn't bowing to
pressure from boycotters. P&amp;G will continue using Salvadoran
coffee beans in Folgers and some of its Maryland Club
coffees, he said.
   Still, boycott supporters hailed the move as a significant
change in policy by the Cincinnati-based consumer goods
company. Last May, P&amp;G canceled its $1 million-a-year
advertising contract at WHDHTV, a Boston television station,
after the station broadcast a commercial urging consumers to
boycott Folgers. The ad was produced by Neighbor to Neighbor.
   But the company could see a backlash by "pandering" to
such special interests, says Tom Pirko, president of BevMark
Inc., an independent Los Angeles consultant. "P&amp;G wants to
pacify a small segment, but the company doesn't want the
public mainstream to get the impression that it's being
bought by left-of-center consumer groups."
   Some restaurants, including Boston-based Pizzeria Uno,
have already dropped Folgers because of the boycott. Neighbor
to Neighbor is also targeting other coffee makers that buy
from El Salvador, including Phillip Morris Cos.' Kraft
General Foods, which makes Maxwell House, and Nestle S.A.'s
Nestle Foods Corp., maker of Nescafe.
   P&amp;G has been urged by the State Department to continue
bean purchases from El Salvador, especially while United
Nations peace talks continue to end the war there. Bernard
Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said in a recent letter to P&amp;G's chairman and chief
executive officer, Edwin L. Artzt: "Your continued coffee
purchases are in the best interest of the peace process and
the people of El Salvador."
   In its diaper advertising settlement, P&amp;G didn't admit any
wrongdoing but agreed to clarify its ads. The ads didn't
mention that only 80% of each diaper can be made into compost
and that few U.S. communities have municipal composting
programs. P&amp;G also agreed to pay each state $5,000.

   PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE Co.'s print ad about diapers and
composting states that its diapers are 80% compostable and 10
communities have compost facilities. An earlier edition
incorrectly described the advertisement.
