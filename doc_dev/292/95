   The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority said Procter &amp; Gamble Co. agreed to pay a $147,350 fine and install purification equipment in response to a number of pollution citations brought against the concern's Quincy, Mass., plant. 

   Following an investigation, the authority cited the plant for, among other things, discharging excessive amounts of zinc, nickel, fat, oil and grease into the city's sewer system that empties into Boston Harbor. 

   The authority said that Procter &amp; Gamble has agreed to end the excessive discharges and to build storm water collection and pre-treatment systems. 

   "We are pleased with this agreement and our role in working together with the MWRA to clean up Boston Harbor," Terry Cole, P&amp;G's Quincy plant manager, said. 

   P&amp;G is a Cincinnati-based maker of household goods and personal-care products.
