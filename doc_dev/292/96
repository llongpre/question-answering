<HEAD>Massachusetts Lawmakers Urges P&amp;G to Reconsider Boston Ad</HEAD>

   Four members of the Massachusetts
congressional delegation urged Procter &amp; Gamble on Monday to resume
advertising on two TV stations that aired spots critical of P&amp;G's
purchase of coffee from El Salvador.
   A letter signed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Reps. Edward
Markey, Joseph P. Kennedy II and Joseph Moakley, all Democrats,
said P&amp;G's decision to pull ads from a station in Boston and
another in Worcester, Mass., set a dangerous precedent.
   The company, the nation's largest advertiser of packaged
products, pulled ads in response to a 30-second commercial that
called for a boycott of Folgers Coffee.
   The commercials were produced by Neighbor to Neighbor, a
political advocacy group that favors a boycott of Folgers as a way
of influencing U.S. foreign policy toward El Salvador. A portion of
the coffee that goes into Folgers comes from El Salvador.
   ``We are alarmed that your company's decision to suspend
advertising on the two stations, simply for disagreeing with the
content of another paid advertisement broadcast over those
stations, is an extremely harmful precedent,'' the legislators
wrote.
   ``Our concern is that television stations might fall victim to
intimidation from a large advertiser out of fear of economic
retribution for airing paid commercials from smaller advertisers,''
the letter said. ``Such economic intimidation comes very close to
an effective corporate censorship over advertising content.''
   The letter was addressed to Edwin L. Artzt, chief exectutive
officer of Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble.
   A spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble did not immediately return a
phone call seeking comment.
