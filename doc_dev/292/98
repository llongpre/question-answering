Forget soap wars. The latest battle is for babies' bottoms, as Pampers
disposable nappies slug it out with rival brand Huggies, and both sides
complain about their opponent's dirty tactics.
Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Pampers, complained to the Advertising
Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, about magazine advertisements
from Huggies manufacturer, Kimberly-Clark. The advertisements claimed
Huggies were 'significantly thinner than the leading nappy, yet incredibly,
they keep your baby just as dry'. P&amp;G, which said the 'leading nappy'
reference was clearly to its brand, Pampers, complained that the
Kimberly-Clark claims were false. It replied by sending laboratory research
to the watchdog in support of its advertisements.
Kimberly-Clark submitted its own complaint to the watchdog about P&amp;G's
advertising, objecting to magazine and direct-mail advertisements.
The watchdog, which engaged its own nappy expert to evaluate the claims,
concluded in its monthly report, released today, that the test results were
not comparable.
Both sides were sent away by the watchdog to see if they could agree a
'mutually acceptable testing procedure in order that such disputes could be
resolved satisfactorily in future'. In the meantime, both parties were told
by the authority not to claim 'anything more than an equal best ability to
keep babies dry'.
Calvin Klein Cosmetics was condemned by the watchdog for the way it used
model Kate Moss in an advertisement for its fragrance, Obsession for Men. It
said the model's naked pose, with her 'child-like form' and the brand name
of the product, were 'inappropriate and irresponsible'.
Some supermarkets use misleading 'basket-of-goods' price comparisons in
their advertising, according to a survey by the watchdog. It said some
advertisers were not comparing like with like.
