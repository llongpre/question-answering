   Up to 10 spacewalks a week will be needed to
maintain outside components of the proposed Space Station Freedom
unless there are major design changes, a study says.
   The study, by astronaut Bill Fisher and Johnson Space Center
engineer Charles Price and released Friday, showed that in peak
maintenance years with the present space station design, two
astronauts working together would have to spend up to 6,462 hours a
year in space suits repairing and replacing parts.
   Other years, the maintenance would require fewer space walks,
the study said, but over the 35-year lifetime of the station the
time spent on repair space walks would average about 3,276
astronaut-hours a year. This would amount to 273 two-person space
walks a year, or 5.3 a week.
   Each space walk takes about six hours.
   Fisher and Price said that the number space walks could be
reduced by up to half if more work can be done by robots that could
be controlled from inside the space station or from the ground.
   Simplifying repair tasks and making all parts replaceable by
robots could drop the total annual space walk hours to 507, a
number that Fisher said would be manageable.
   NASA has been criticized by Congress for designing a space
station that would require so much maintenance, so much so that
much of the time of at least two astronauts on board would be spent
on repairs and parts replacement.
   The current plan calls for eight-member crews.
   Richard Kohrs, director of the space station program, said that
design of the station is now undergoing a major review and that
each of the recommendations in the Fisher-Price study will be
evaluated.
   He said changes are being made that will cut down on the weight,
power use and maintenance of the station.
   Reducing the number of space walks, he said, is a major goal.
   ``We're going to build the space station for science research,''
Kohrs said at a news conference Friday. ``If you are spending a
major part of your time on EVA (extra vehicular activity or space
walks), then you are taking that away from science.''
   NASA executives had ordered the space walk study to coincide
with the space station design review. Kohrs said the purpose of the
study was to spot problems so that corrections can be made before
construction of station parts begins.
   Assembly of the space station is expected to begin in about
three years and it is expected to be permanently occupied by 1996.
   The station is expected to cost about $30 billion and last about
35 years. NASA has said the station is critical to the agency's
future plans to explore the moon and to voyage to Mars.
   The Fisher-Price report said that a major problem to overcome is
the number of hours of space walking required to maintain the
station while it is being assembled. The station will be put
together with a series of 18 flights by the space shuttle, and
parts of the station will spend months in orbit before it is
permanently occupied by astronauts.
   During that 30-month assembly period, the report said, there
will be a need for 6,267 hours of maintenance by spacewalking
astronauts. This equals about four two-man spacewalks a week.
   ``All of these would have to be done from the space shuttle,''
said Fisher.
   Another study, started after the Fisher-Price team made a
preliminary report in the spring, concluded with estimates close to
those of Fisher and Price. The study, led by William Simon of the
Johnson Space Center, said, however, that with changes in design,
the spacewalks required to maintain the station could be reduced to
about 485 man-hours a year.
