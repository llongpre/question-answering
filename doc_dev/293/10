   Two Soviet cosmonauts will spend the Russian
Christmas on Jan. 7 walking in space, Tass reported Saturday.
   Viktor Afanasyev and Musa Manarov will make another attempt to
repair a broken hatch on a module attached to the orbiting Mir
space station, the official Soviet news agency said.
   Two other cosmonauts spent a grueling seven hours in space in
July trying to repair a torn thermal insulation on their Soyuz TM-9
capsule, only to discover they could not close the hatch leading
back to the space station.
   Soviet media reported at the time they were dangerously close to
running out of oxygen, although the cosmonauts later denied they
had any problems.
   They were able to close the hatch on a subsequent space walk,
but Tass said it continues to cause problems.
   Afanasyev and Manarov took the first journalist into space on
their Dec. 2 launch, Toyohiro Akiyama of Japan's TBS television
network. Akiyama returned to Earth eight days later with the
outgoing cosmonauts.
