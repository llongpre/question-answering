<LEADPARA>  Bowing to congressional demands for economy, NASA said today it is cutting $8
billion from the cost of its proposed space station, reducing its size and
delaying completion until the year 2000.;    The scaled-back design was
denounced in advance by scientists as a waste of money.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But NASA administrator Richard Truly called the overhauled plan a prudent
investment and a commitment to sustained leadership in space.;    "It is
consistent with congressional directives; is affordable; simplifies assembly
and operation; reduces the size, complexity, number of space shuttle launches
and extravehicular activity (space walking) requirements," he said.;    The
station, to be named Freedom, "provides a world-class microgravity research
and life sciences capability for its users," Truly said.;    If the redesign
gets congressional approval, assembly of the station in orbit will begin early
in 1996. It would be ready for operation by visiting astronauts in mid-1997
and ready for permanent occupancy by a four-man crew in the year 2000.;    A
vehicle would be built to return astronauts to Earth in an emergency.;    Sen.
Al Gore, D-Tenn., said his space subcommittee will do "some intense work on
this project" when hearings begin next month.;    NASA's engineers spent five
feverish months in the effort to trim costs, which have mounted to nearly $4
billion for studies and prototype parts since President Reagan proposed the
station in 1984.;    Congress last year ordered NASA to slash $6 billion from
the project through 1996 and put a yearly cap of $2.6 billion on spending.
Even NASA was dismayed to find in an in-house study that just maintaining the
station would require up to 3,700 hours of space walks by astronauts each
year.;    The new design envisions cutting that back drastically through
snap-together trusses that have electrical and other components built in. The
living and working modules also would be outfitted on the ground, rather than
in space.;    In the redesign, NASA said it is giving first priority to life
sciences -- the effect of space travel on humans -- and placing microgravity
studies second. That is what a White House commission recommended, but it's
the reverse of what Congress demanded.;    Cutbacks will affect the station in
a number of other ways. Instead of computers able to transmit data 31,250
times the speed of an ordinary facsimile machine, the station will have
computers that send data at only 5,200 times that speed. There will be seven
computers, not 22; 12 laboratory racks, not 28.;    NASA said the station will
meet agreements signed with the European Space Agency and Japan, both of which
plan to attach modules to the truss.;    The space station that Reagan
proposed was to have been put into orbit by 1994 at a cost of $8 billion. The
price, however, continued to escalate with the years, to $38.3 billion most
recently. The first construction flight was scheduled for 1995.;    Under the
new plans, the cost will be $30 billion and the first launch of station parts
aboard the space shuttle would be in the first three months of 1996.  </TEXT>
