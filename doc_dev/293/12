FT  30 NOV 93 / Toil and trouble: Nasa needs to repair its public image, as
well as the Hubble telescope

The space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral
tomorrow morning on what Nasa calls a routine servicing flight - and critics
say is a risky make-or-break mission for the troubled space agency.
The objective of the 11-day flight is to service and repair the Hubble Space
Telescope, a Dollars 2bn orbiting observatory which caused Nasa huge
embarrassment after its launch in 1990, when it turned out that the
instrument's 2.4 metre mirror had been ground to the wrong shape. Three
hundred miles above the earth's obscuring atmosphere, Hubble should have
enabled astronomers to see seven times further into the universe than ever
before; instead, the faulty mirror produced fuzzy pictures only slightly
better than the most powerful ground-based telescopes.
The mission is routine only in the sense that Hubble was designed for
maintenance in orbit every three to five years. No one had imagined when it
was launched that so much would need to be put right now, nor that Nasa
would be so desperate for a spectacular success to reverse the steady
deterioration in its public image after a catalogue of disasters - most
recently the loss of the Dollars 980m Mars Observer craft.
Nasa has picked a crew of seven space veterans, with an average age of 46,
for what is sure to be the most complex and challenging of the 59 shuttle
flights undertaken so far. The senior member is Dr Story Musgrave, 58, who
has been an astronaut since 1967.
On Friday the Swiss flight engineer, Mr Claude Nicollier, will use
Endeavour's robot arm to pull the bus-sized Hubble on to a special stand in
the cargo bay. Then the mission plan includes five days of space walks, each
lasting six hours, during which the astronauts will work in pairs to put
right as many as possible of Hubble's defects.
The single most important job will to fit 'spectacles' to correct the
telescope's short-sightedness. An instrument called Costar (for corrective
optics space telescope axial replacement) will slot in behind the famous
flawed mirror, containing 10 small coin-sized mirrors ground to compensate
optically for the defect.
But there are 11 other items to repair or replace. They include faulty
electronic components, three failed gyroscopes and Hubble's solar panels,
which have been disturbing its delicate instruments by juddering in response
to temperature changes whenever the craft passes from sunlight into
darkness. Indeed, changing the 12-metre solar arrays  - made by British
Aerospace as part of the European Space Agency's 15 per cent contribution to
the project - may turn out to be the most delicate operation of all.
The schedule is bound to change 'as events unfold', Mr Nicollier said last
month. 'There will be surprises, of that we can be sure. We therefore have
to visualise the unforeseeable.'
To prepare for unexpected events, the astronauts have trained longer and
more intensively for the Hubble repair mission than for any previous shuttle
flight. They have spent 700 hours rehearsing for their 11 days in space,
including 400 hours under water in a huge tank built to simulate
weightlessness at the Marshall Space Flight Centre in Alabama.
'I may have been in the water hundreds of hours, I may have been in the
clean room hundreds of hours (getting to know Hubble's replacement parts),'
Dr Musgrave said at the end of training, 'but, like the Olympics, it boils
down to a few seconds. You've got one shot at it. It's got to go right.'
As the astronauts know only too well, far more is at stake than their
ability to make Hubble work to its original specifications - and possibly
give astronomers a view of the distant universe good enough to set off a
scientific revolution like the one after Galileo's first use of a telescope
400 years ago.
The future of Nasa could hinge on the Hubble mission. A success would begin
to shore up public and political confidence in the once-proud agency, which
has been undermined by a string of failures since the 1986 Challenger
explosion. In particular, it would show that shuttle-borne astronauts can
carry out a complicated series of manoeuvres of the sort that will be needed
to assemble and use the planned Space Station Freedom, due to go into
operation early next century.
A failure would feed ammunition to congressional budget-cutters, who
succeeded recently in killing the US's other big science project, the
Dollars 11bn Superconducting Super Collider, and are keen also to shoot down
the multi-billion dollar space station. Its cancellation would leave Nasa
without a clear future in manned space flight beyond the ageing shuttle
programme - and could lead to the agency's dismemberment.
Mr Daniel Goldin, who was appointed Nasa administrator by former President
George Bush early last year and has been kept on by President Bill Clinton,
put on a brave face when he appeared before the Senate science, technology
and space subcommittee this month. 'We are not afraid,' he said. 'If we fail
(in the Hubble mission), we will dust ourselves down and do it again.'
But Mr Goldin pleaded with the senators not to cut Nasa's budget any more.
The Bush administration reduced its five-year spending plan from an original
request of Dollars 106bn in 1991 to Dollars 96bn; since then, this had been
cut to Dollars 78bn - and it could fall to Dollars 71bn, according to the
latest proposals.
With everyone's attention focused on the space-walking astronauts and the
implications for Nasa of their success or failure, the astronomers - for
whose scientific benefit the repair mission is supposedly being undertaken -
are feeling rather left out.
'Although some people felt it was an outrageous waste to spend Dollars 2bn
on the original Hubble project, because so much money would have given far
better returns to science if it had been spent on earth-based observatories,
most of us welcomed Hubble because it brought in extra funds that would not
otherwise have been spent on astronomy,' said one European astronomer. 'The
same is true of the repair mission. Some astronomers were getting good
results from Hubble, faulty as it was, and they didn't want to risk spending
Dollars 620m to ruin it, but most of us recognise that Nasa has to try to
repair it for political reasons.'
Even if the Endeavour mission appears to be a spectacular success over the
next 11 days, it will not be clear for at least a month whether the
astronauts have repaired Hubble and Nasa's reputation. It will take several
weeks to remote-test all the new equipment, before Nasa can send the
telescope instructions to start observing. Few pictures in history will be
awaited with such anticipation.
