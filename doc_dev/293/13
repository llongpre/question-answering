   If all goes according to plan _ and there's
every likelihood that it won't _ a space shuttle will leave its
Florida launch pad in March 1995 carrying the first pieces of
America's space station into orbit.
   Ten flights and 28 months later, by the same shaky timetable,
the parts flown up piece by piece will have been assembled into a
place where men and women can live and work for months at a time,
looking down at the Earth as they silently drift across the sky 250
miles high.
   By August 1999, seven years late but just in time for the 21st
Century, the space station will be finished, serving as a basic
research laboratory for medicine, astronomy, space physics, and as
a staging area for manned flights to the moon and beyond.
   Mostly what stands in the way of this rosy scenario is money.
   Space Station Freedom, as it is named, began as an $8 billion,
10-year project when President Reagan announced it in 1984. It has
grown into a 15-year marathon likely to cost $19 billion or well
over $30 billion, depending on whose figures you use.
   From the start, the space station has had problems with money as
well as with identity and purpose. Former Sen. William Proxmire of
Wisconsin summed up the feelings of many in Congress when he called
the space station ``a project in search of a mission.''
   NASA administrator Richard Truly, a former astronaut, considers
the space station ``the cornerstone to our future in space,'' but
admits the program has had a sputtering past.
   ``In the last five years, Space Station Freedom has undergone 11
major reviews, has faced nearly continual readjustments of its
budget, has had a great deal of management turnover and has
experienced several configuration and schedule changes,'' he says.
   The management turnover reached its peak in May and June of this
year when three top space station executives left NASA.
   The budgeting process for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _
the year in which the design phase ends and cutting of metal begins
_ illustrates the station's travails.
   President Bush proposed that NASA get $2.05 billion for the
space station, but the House Appropriations Committee in July
decided to chop off $400 million. With that prospect, the space
agency made plans for a 20 percent reduction only to readjust when
actual appropriations ended as $1.85 billion.
   ``The thing that's really tough is the funding instability in
the program,'' says William T. Lenoir, the NASA associate
administrator and former astronaut who reversed a trend and
returned to the agency from private life this year to take charge
of the space flight and space station programs.
   ``In June of every year we don't know what the hell we are going
to get in October,'' he says. ``This year, beginning in June, we
slowed the progress of the space station down because if we had
continued to build on schedule there was a real danger that we'd
get to October and be firing contractors and laying off civil
service (employees).''
   The House Committee on Science and Technology authorized
three-year funding for NASA to give space programs some stability.
However, congressional appropriations committees who vote the
actual money have not gone along.
   So NASA has to live with the uncertainty.
   ``We are very much prejudiced to starting to construct the space
station in March 1995,'' Lenoir says. The choices then boil down,
he says, to ``can we start either less of a station in March 1995,
or can we start in 1995 and let it take longer (to complete)? And
last on our list is, `Okay, we can't start in 1995.''
   The station is America's big project for the next decade. Even
President Bush's space goal for returning Americans to the moon and
then pushing on to Mars requires that a space station be in place
first.
   When Reagan, in his 1984 State of the Union message, directed
NASA to build the station within a decade, there were giddy plans
for having it up and running in 1992 to celebrate the 500-year
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America.
   To cut down on the spiraling cost, NASA a few years ago divided
the station building program into two phases, intending to finish
one before starting the other. Now nobody talks about the second
block.
   The latest plan envisions limiting crew size to four until the
station is able to support a permanent crew of eight, planned for
July 1997. There will be only 37.5 kilowatts of power available
until that time, when it will be doubled. The smaller the amount of
power, the fewer the experiments that can be run.
   NASA had planned to develop a new high-pressure space suit at a
cost of some $200 million. Instead, the existing shuttle space suit
will be used for the space walks that will be required to assemble
the station. NASA says it wants to reduce the need for space walks
anyway.
   One plan under consideration to save both money and time is to
develop a so-called ``Shuttle-C'' that would substitute a cargo
container for the shuttle orbiter and provide more than double the
cargo-carrying capacity. Such a method could cut out up to seven of
the 16 shuttle trips now planned to bring station parts into orbit.
   What will the station look like? In the present configuration
there would be a truss 508.5 feet long, constructed from long tubes
made of a composite material with a protective coating and joined
like a child's Tinker Toy set.
   Two U.S. modules _ the laboratory and the living quarters _
would be attached to the truss. Each is 14.5 feet wide and 44 feet
long. The Japanese and European modules are of similar size.
   On each end of the truss would be attached two huge photovoltaic
arrays, looking like giant windmill paddles, to gather power from
the sun. Two smaller structures would radiate heat out of the
modules. Another structure will be a telerobotic servicer, a
sophisticated crane capable of performing precise manipulations in
space.
   The habitation module, divided into a quiet zone, a buffer zone
and an active zone, is where the crew meets, eats, sleeps,
exercises, has recreation and receives medical attention if needed.
   Truly says that without the space station, ``the future we dream
of will never become the present we experience.''
   The working quarters of the space station will be five times the
size of its Soviet counterpart, Mir. It will produce 10 times as
much electrical power as skylab, allowing experiments never before
possible.
   ``An evolved space station,'' he says, ``is the first essential
step toward moving again beyond Earth orbit into the solar
system.'' And from that will spring the return to the moon and
journey to Mars.
   ``Each time we go to the frontier and beyond,'' says Truly, ``we
bring back more than we hoped for. This time we have the chance to
bring back more than we can imagine.''
