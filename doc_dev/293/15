   NASA's top officials are trying to assure
skeptical congressmen that a scaled-down space station now on the
drawing boards will have the same capabilities as originally
promised.
   ``Space Station Freedom assembly-completed is going to be
essentially the Space Station Freedom we have been committed to,''
NASA administrator Richard Truly told the House Science and
Technology Committee on Tuesday.
   He said an extensive review that resulted in major technical
changes to the proposed space station was necessary because of
threatened cuts in NASA's budget. NASA, he said, must ``get off the
funding seesaw.''
   ``We have requested multi-year appropriations for each of the
last two years _ without success,'' Truly said. He said longer-term
funding ``is critical to the ultimate success of this program.''
   The space station, Truly said, will still cost $13 billion in
1984 dollars _ $19 billion currently _ but the cost will be spread
over an extra 18 months because of a new schedule designed to
stretch available funds.
   The top-to-bottom design review of the proposed space station
was conducted this summer when it appeared the program might be cut
by $400 million from President Bush's requested $2.05 billion for
1990. The actual cut was about $200 million.
   The changes angered the committee that authorizes funds for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   William Lenoir, head of the NASA space station office, said the
station _ now estimated for completion late in the next decade _
still is being planned to house eight astronauts and to have 75
kilowatts of electrical power.
   ``These are the capabilities we had promised and they still will
be there,'' he told the House panel. ``It will have more
capabilities than any space station this country has ever flown, or
any country has ever flown.''
   Truly and Lenoir were summoned to the hearing by its chairman,
Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., who called the revisions a great
disappointment to the committee, whose members he said had sold a
far different project to their colleagues in the House.
   ``Today's hearing is not a pleasant occasion,'' Roe said, adding
that one capability involving the space station definitely was
gone: ``That is the capability as a government to set our sights on
a goal and work toward it with a common commitment.''
   Truly said because of ``the level of budget threats we were
facing there was no other responsible management action I could
take.''
   ``We can't continue to provide capabilities on schedule without
money,'' he said.
   The major changes to the station are technical, involving types
of power, and the means of maintaining the station`s position. One
of the changes simplifies the assembly of the station in orbit,
cutting down on the amount of space walking astronauts will be
required to do. Also, NASA will save about $200 million by not
developing new space suits.
