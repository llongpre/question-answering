   Twelve men, all Americans, walked on
the moon in those heady days of Apollo exploration. Their fame was
fleeting and their names today are mostly dim memories.
   Neil Armstrong earned a place in history 20 years ago when he
became the first human to leave his footprints in the ancient lunar
dust.
   The rest, in order: Buzz Aldrin, Charles Conrad Jr., Alan L.
Bean, Alan B. Shepard Jr., Edgar D. Mitchell, David R. Scott, James
B. Irwin, John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr., Eugene A. Cernan and
Harrison H. Schmitt.
   Each was affected profoundly by his stay on the moon and the
perspective it gave them of Earth.
   ``My impression was of the importance of that small, fragile,
remote blue planet,'' Armstrong reported. ``People everywhere have,
by television and photographs, shared that perspective and shared
our concern for the security of our globe.''
   Nine of the moon-walkers are business executives, one is an
artist, one is an evangelist, and one remains with NASA, an
engineering trouble-shooter.
   Here is a glance:
   _ Neil A. Armstrong, 58 ... aeronautical engineering degree from
Purdue ... flew 78 combat missions in Korea ... X-15 test pilot ...
commanded Gemini 8, aborted shortly after the first docking of two
vehicles in space ... first man to walk on the moon ... shunned the
spotlight and became a professor of aerospace engineering at the
University of Cincinnati for nine years ... chairman CTA Inc.,
Lebanon, Ohio, a computer systems company.
   _ Buzz Aldrin, 59 ... born Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., but legally
changed name ... son of a general ... West Point honor graduate ...
fighter pilot in Korea ... Gemini 12 space walker ... landed on the
moon with Armstrong on Apollo 11 ... commander of the Aerospace
Research Pilots School ... passed over for promotion to brigadier
general by the Air Force ... suffered mental depression and bouts
with alcoholism and recovered from both ... now president of his own
Los Angeles-based firm, Research &amp; Engineering Consultants.
   _ Charles Conrad Jr., 59 ... engineering degree from Princeton
... Navy test pilot ... eight days in space aboard Gemini 5 ...
commanded Gemini 11 ... commanded Apollo 12 moon landing ... daring
space walks helped save crippled Skylab station ... now a senior
vice president of Douglas Aircraft Co., Long Beach, Calif.
   _ Alan L. Bean, 57 ... aeronautical engineering degree from
University of Texas ... Navy test pilot ... holder of 11 world
records in space and aeronautics ... landed on the moon with Conrad
... commanded 56-day Skylab 2 flight ... resigned from NASA in 1981
to devote time to his hobby, painting, and now turns out expensive
canvases of the moon and other space scenes in his Houston studio.
   _ Alan B. Shepard Jr., 65 ... Naval Academy graduate ... carrier
and test pilot ... only one of the seven original Mercury astronauts
to walk on the moon ... first American in space, a 15-minute
suborbital flight in 1961 ... grounded for several years by an ear
disorder ... commanded Apollo 14 moon landing ... several banking,
real estate and other business interests have made him a Houston
millionaire.
   _ Edgar D. Mitchell, 58 ... doctorate of science from MIT ...
Navy carrier and test pilot ... landed on the moon with Shepard ...
en route to moon he conducted extrasensory perception experiments
with a friend in Chicago ... on return he concentrated on research
into psychic phenomena and wrote a book about it ... now chairman of
Forecast Systems Inc., West Palm Beach, Fla.
   _ David R. Scott, 57 ... fifth in West Point class ... master of
science from MIT ... Air Force test pilot ... flew with Armstrong on
the aborted Gemini 8 flight ... commander of Apollo 9 Earth-orbiting
mission that tested the Lunar Module ... commanded Apollo 15 moon
landing ... Scott and crewmates James B. Irwin and Alfred P. Worden
admitted carrying 400 unauthorized stamps to the moon which they
planned to sell; all three were removed from astronaut status ...
Scott became director of NASA's Flight Research School and now is
president of Scott Science and Technology, Lancaster, Calif.
   _ James B. Irwin, 59 ... Naval Academy graduate ... Air Force
test pilot ... with Scott, drove first lunar car on the moon ...
viewed his Apollo 15 moon journey as an overwhelming religious
experience ... founded High Flight, an interdenominational
evangelistic foundation, headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colo.
... slowed by three heart attacks, but continues his religious work
... made six expeditions to Mount Ararat in Turkey in search for
Noah's ark.
   _ John W. Young, 58 ... aeronautical engineering graduate of
Georgia Tech ... piloted Gemini 3, the first manned Gemini flight,
and commanded Gemini 10 ... orbited moon on Apollo 10 and landed as
commander of Apollo 16 ... only moonwalker to fly on the space
shuttle, commanding the first and ninth missions ... has made a
record six space flights ... served as chief of the astronaut office
and now is special assistant for engineering operations and safety
at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   _ Charles M. Duke Jr., 53 ... Naval Academy graduate ... master
of science from MIT ... Air Force test pilot ... landed on the moon
with Young ... now a partner in Duke Investments and president of
Southwest Wilderness Art in San Antonio, Texas.
   _ Eugene A. Cernan, 55 ... degree in electrical engineering from
Purdue ... Navy fighter pilot ... Gemini 9 spacewalker ... flew
