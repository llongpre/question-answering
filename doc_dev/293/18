Two cosmonauts who nearly ran out of oxygen when they were locked out of their 
space station by a sticky hatch must take another space walk next week to 
repair the door, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts, who encountered the trouble when they were outside their space 
station making repairs on Tuesday, will venture out again to fix the hatch, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
A ground controller at the Soviet Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad said 
cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin will make the new space walk 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Solovyev and Balandin went outside the Mir space station to fix thermal 
insulation that was damaged during the launch of the Soyuz TM-9 capsule they 
must use to return to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the strenuous space walk, which took two hours longer than 
planned, the cosmonauts were prevented from re-entering the spacecraft because 
they could not completely close the hatch they were using to re-enter. 
</P>
<P>
With their oxygen running dangerously low, they were forced to use an emergency 
porthole on another part of the space station complex to get back inside, seven 
hours after their exit. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, they apparently closed an inner hatch to seal one end of the 
air-lock compartment that leads to the troublesome outside hatch. Isaulov told 
Pravda that the outside hatch is "slightly ajar," leaving the air-lock 
compartment unsealed.
