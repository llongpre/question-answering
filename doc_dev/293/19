   When the Soviet Union launched Cosmos 1941 on
April 27, it added to the productive satellites in orbit but also
contributed 28 pieces to the junk that circles the Earth.
   Every time a rocket slices through the atmosphere to the void
beyond, it adds to the litter. Some of the 7,110 pieces in orbit
are destined to travel around the globe for all time.
   The United States and Soviet Union are the principal
contributors of man-made objects in space, which range in size from
a screwdriver dropped by a space-walking astronaut to the Soviet
Mir space station.
   Somewhere out there, too _ if they haven't re-entered the
atmosphere and burned up _ are 10 or 12 screws about [-inch in
diameter, missing when the 1984 shuttle mission returned from
repairing the Solar Max satellite.
   Another object that racked up millions of miles before it
finally burned up was the thermal glove that floated out of Gemini
4 in 1965 while Ed White had the hatch open for the first space
walk by an American.
   The U.S. Space Command in Colorado tracks all objects in space
and all countries are obligated to inform one another about their
launches.
   Six days after the Cosmos 1941 launch, in a weekly update, the
space command said 3,246 of the 7,110 pieces they were tracking by
radar came from the Soviet Union. The trackers said they detected
28 new pieces and that eight others had ``decayed'' _ re-entered
the atmosphere _ for a net gain of 20 pieces.
   The United States was responsible for 3,148 pieces, the European
Space Agency, 481; Japan, 82, and France, 40.
   The totals are nearly always three pieces of space debris for
every working satellite. More than half the debris comes from more
than 90 satellites that have exploded unaccountably, according to
Don Kessler, project scientist for debris studies at NASA's Johnson
Space Center.
   Dangerous chunks of shrapnel, whizzing through space at 22,000
mph, also come from spent rocket bodies that shatter when residual
fuels come in contact with each other. ``A 3-millimeter particle
has as much kinetic energy as a bowling ball going 60 miles an hour
and if it hit an electrical component, it would probably cause that
system to cease functioning,'' Kessler said.
   Space shuttle Challenger returned from a mission in June 1983
with a chip in the middle window on the right side of the cockpit.
Chemical analysis showed the culprit was a flake of the paint used
on rockets and payloads. The window had to be replaced.
   Space station planners ``are faced with a considerable design
problem'' because of the junk, Kessler said, and have added 2,000
pounds of shielding to each of the six modules that will be
occupied by astronauts.
   The explosions of satellites or rockets often aren't detected
for a year or more after they occur, he said. A French-made Ariane
rocket blew up nine months after it deposited its cargo in space.
The fragments of that explosion, probably caused by
overpressurization of gases, number 450.
   After six U.S. Delta rocket second stages exploded _ the last in
1981, three years after it was launched _ the manufacturer fixed
the flaw that caused the blasts, leaks in tanks holding fuels that
burn when they combine.
