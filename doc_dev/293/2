   Astronaut William Fisher says he is confident
NASA will find ways to cut down on the number and length of space
walks the proposed space station will need to keep it running.
   ``This is an engineering problem,'' said Fisher. ``Engineering
is what NASA does better than anything in the world.''
   Fisher and NASA engineer Charles R. Price head a space agency
committee that recently said the station will need impossibly large
amounts of maintenance. They stuck to their estimate after meeting
with NASA executives Friday, but said it's only ``our preliminary,
first cut at this data.''
   Fisher, a physician, and Price said in their study that the
station _ as now conceived _ would require 2,284 hours of
maintenance each year by astronauts working in the harsh
environment of open space.
   After The New York Times published those findings on Monday,
congressional space committees expressed their concerns and three
of them will hold hearings next week.
   ``No, I haven't changed my mind; no, I haven't been pressured,''
Fisher told reporters after Friday's review. But, he said, the
numbers were obtained by asking all NASA space station contractors
to total the amount of time they think it will take astronauts to
fix what breaks.
   ``The number we have come up with in our preliminary first cut
at this data is 2,284 hours in EVA time,'' Fisher said. EVA, for
extra-vehicular activity, is NASA's term for space walks. Fisher
said that's 32 percent higher than estimated in a similar study
last October.
   He said that would require an average of 3.7 space walks a week.
William B. Lenoir, NASA's space flight boss, who conducted Friday's
review told reporters he would prefer no more than one space walk a
month.
   ``I do think there's room for it to go down,'' Fisher said.
``It's our hope we can drive it down significantly. The function of
the next four months is to take piece-by-piece the components of
this number and see how much of its real and to see how much we can
cut down on it.''
   The space station, expected to cost more than $30 billion by the
time it's completed and manned in 1999, is undergoing final design
reviews now with the first construction trips into orbit scheduled
for 1995. Fisher and Price said their study, initiated by NASA, is
part of those reviews.
