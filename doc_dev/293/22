<LEADPARA>  Two astronauts made America's first successful emergency spacewalk Sunday from
the shuttle Atlantis, saving a $617 million astronomy observatory by freeing a
stuck antenna.;    The 4 1/2-hour orbital ballet took place 280 miles above
Earth at 17,000 mph, beginning at about 11:40 a.m. PDT Sunday. It was the
first U.S. spacewalk since December 1985 and the second "unplanned" outing
prompted by a crisis.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Ross, 43, performed the equivalent of kicking a
tire when he gave a shake to the stuck boom of the high-gain communications
antenna, freeing it to swing out as planned from one end of the massive Gamma
Ray Observatory (GRO).;    The "Jay and Jerry Show," as Mission Control billed
it, resulted from remote cameras aboard the shuttle that provided stunning
live television images of the drama, which at times turned into a happy romp.;
   NASA officials have long argued that this is the advantage of having a
piloted shuttle and that it balances the risks and costs: Humans can cope with
the unexpected in a way that robots cannot. For this reason, they say, the
shuttle is the safest launcher for top-priority payloads of increasing
complexity.;    Ross broke the boom free 19 minutes after he had floated out
of the Atlantis air lock to begin what NASA refers to as EVA (extravehicular
activity). He was assisted during the outing by mission specialist Jay Apt,
41, a physicist.;    Cheers and applause erupted in the two National
Aeronautics and Space Administration control rooms in Houston and Greenbelt,
Md., from relieved engineers and scientists. Shouts of "Far out!" and
"Fantastic!" rang between the astronauts and mission control at Johnson Space
Center in Houston.;    "I'm just thankful there was a man in the loop here,"
said Goddard Space Flight Center's John Hrastar, GRO project manager. GRO's
controllers at Goddard had tried and failed six times to free the balky
high-gain antenna by remote control.;    Unplanned walk;  The astronauts had
not planned to go spacewalking until today, when they are to test a mini-rail
system scheduled for use in constructing the proposed orbital space station in
the late 1990s. Much of that exercise is still on the schedule, but once the
antenna problem was solved, the astronauts performed some of today's
assignments Sunday, trying out hand tools and a rope transport system.;   
Ross was on the team that made the last U.S. spacewalk, in December 1985. The
following month, the Challenger accident grounded the shuttle fleet for more
than two years.;    The only other emergency spacewalk occurred in April 1985,
when shuttle astronauts tried unsuccessfully to flip a switch on a Navy
communications satellite using a jury-rigged "fly swatter" and the robot arm.
The satellite was later retrieved for repairs.;    GRO is designed to
investigate gamma rays, the most energetic and least studied radiation in the
cosmos, with instruments 10 to 50 times more sensitive than their
predecessors.;    Complex maneuvers;  The crew was in the midst of a complex
sequence of maneuvers leading to GRO's deployment in orbit when the antenna
problem was discovered.;    Earlier in the day, mission specialist Linda
Godwin had used the shuttle's robot arm to lift GRO straight up and out of the
payload bay and into position to unfurl its solar panels, accordion fashion,
to a wingspan of 70 feet. At 17 tons, it is the heaviest science satellite the
United States has launched.;    When controllers had no luck extending the
antenna, the astronauts tried moving the orbiter, then tried flexing the robot
arm to shake it loose. Still no luck. The antenna boom was stuck in the cradle
on GRO's underside, where it is stored during launch.;    Data receptor;  The
antenna -- a dish at the end of a 16 1/2-foot boom -- is to transmit and
receive data through a NASA communications satellite, which is to relay it to
Goddard through a station in White Sands, N.M. Although it passed release
tests on the ground, "in space, it takes much less torque to hang you up,"
Hrastar said.;    At 11:40 a.m., as Atlantis passed above the southern tip of
Africa, live TV images from a remote camera mounted in the cargo bay showed
Ross pushing his way out of the air lock like a baby chick hatching.;    As he
floated back along the side of the cargo bay at the end of a tether, Godwin
used the robot arm to move the GRO down where he could reach it.;    Hrastar
said engineers believe a small piece of the boom's insulation had snagged on a
bolt or other protrusion -- "not a super major grab" -- and came loose easily
when Ross shook it.;     DIAGRAM: Karl Tate -- Associated Press; NASA's new
orbital observatory; The Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) is the second in a
planned series of four major Earth-orbiting telescopes and astronomy
satellites. GRO's mission is to study gamma-ray-emitting objects in our galaxy
and beyond. The first observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, detects
ultraviolet and visible light. Two others are planned; the Advanced X-Ray
Observatory (AXAF) and the Space infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF); ...;

cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere or be seen by human eyes. The rays
have the highest energies of any type of light radiation, and are emitted by
