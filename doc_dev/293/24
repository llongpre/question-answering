   Two cosmonauts soared into space Wednesday on a
mission to continue the manufacture of ultra-pure crystals for
profit in what has become the centerpiece of the Soviet space
program.
   A Soyuz TM-10 capsule carrying flight commander Gennady Manakov
and engineer Gennady Strekalov rose into a hazy sky atop a column
of orange and white flames from the Baikonur Space Center in
Kazakhstan.
   The capsule blasted off as scheduled at 1:32 p.m.
   Watching the launch in the 109-degree heat were two Japanese
broadcasters, one of whom will be a paying passenger on a Dec. 2
mission that could bring the Soviet space program an estimated $16
million.
   On Friday, Manakov and Strekalov will rendezvous with the Mir
space station to replace Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin,
cosmonauts who have been working in orbit since Feb. 11.
   During their 4{-month mission, Manakov and Strekalov will
continue the work Solovyev and Balandin began: ``growing''
super-pure crystals for use in semiconductors and computer chips.
   The program is designed to bring profits of more than $40
million.
   Solovyev and Balandin, who return to Earth on Aug. 9, grew 23
such crystals in the weightlessness of space using the special
Kristall module attached to the Mir complex. Each is worth about $1
million, the Tass news agency reported.
   Producing such crystals and other space manufacturing ``is
clearly the centerpiece'' of the Soviet space program, said James
Oberg, author of several books on the Soviet space program, in an
interview from his Texas home.
   ``It's the key to their commercialization of space,'' he said.
   Such importance is given to the crystals, Oberg said, that the
past two Soyuz flights to the Mir have had only two cosmonauts
aboard so the canister of crystals could ride home in the capsule's
empty third seat.
   Starting in December and continuing into 1992, however, the
third seat will be occupied by foreign passengers paying the
Soviets hard currency, perhaps as much as $16 million, Oberg said.
   Sitting in the Soyuz capsule's third seat in December will be
either Tokyo Broadcasting System camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi, 26, or
Toyohiro Akiyama, 48, the former Washington bureau chief for the
network. The Japanese chosen will spend eight days in space, Tass
said.
   The launch of the seventh main mission to the Mir was not
broadcast live on Soviet television, as previous launches have
been. A taped report was shown two hours later.
   Before the cosmonauts got into a bus that took them to the
launch pad, Manakov saluted Vladimir Ivanov, chairman of the state
commission on spaceflight, and said: ``The crew of the spaceship is
ready for the flight.''
   ``I wish you a successful flight and happy return to the native
land,'' replied Ivanov.
   When the cosmonauts reached the launch pad, each was kissed on
the cheek by an unidentified man wearing a military uniform. In a
brief exchange with journalists, Manakov, 40, wisecracked that
``the older one'' _ meaning 49-year-old Strekalov _ would be
filling them in on the mission's progress in space.
   A journalist shouted a traditional Russian colloquial expression
for luck before a risky venture: ``Neither feathers nor fluff!''
and a smiling Manakov gave the appropriate response: ``To hell with
you!''
   Manakov, a test pilot, is making his first space flight.
Strekalov is a veteran cosmonaut on his fourth flight, having
worked aboard the Salyut space station.
   Tass said they are expected to make at least two spacewalks,
during which they will conduct further unspecified repairs to a
hatch on the Kvant-2 module attached to the Mir complex.
   During a July 17 excursion outside the space station to repair
torn thermal insulation on their Soyuz TM-9 capsule, Solovyev and
Balandin discovered they could not close a hatch at the end of
their space walk. They were, however, able to close it on a
subsequent, July 26 space walk.
