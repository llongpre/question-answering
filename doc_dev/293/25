   The writer began covering America's space
program for The Associated Press in May 1959. He has covered more
than 2,300 rocket or missile launches, including every U.S. manned
mission. On Wednesday, he retired, but not before covering his 65th
manned space flight.

   Appropriately, a manned rocket
blasted off on the day of my retirement. I almost believe those who
kidded me that NASA delayed Atlantis all those days so it could be
that way.
   Manned rockets have been a great part of my life during the 31
years I have written about space for The Associated Press. It
started with the first one _ Alan Shepard's in 1961 _ and continued
through all 64 others, as Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and the space
shuttle streaked across the pages of history.
   I have been fortunate to report on a whole new era of mankind,
the Space Age, from its very outset to the present.
   My memories would fill volumes, but there are a few _ most
happy, some very sad _ that stand out.
   There was Shepard's brief leap across the threshhold of space;
John Glenn's epic orbital flight in 1962; the rendezvous, docking
and space walk missions of the Gemini program that perfected the
techniques for going to the moon; the close call with death that
Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott had when Gemini 8 spun out of control.
   Then, there was the 1967 launch pad fire that killed the first
Apollo crew; the recovery from the fire and the remarkable series
of Apollo flights, including Apollo 8's circling of the moon on
Christmas Eve, that led to man's first landing on the lunar surface
in 1969; the near-tragedy of Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank ruptured
near the moon and three men had to battle for their lives for three
days to get safely back to Earth.
   There were the Skylab space station flights lasting up to 84
days; the joint U.S.-Soviet mission in 1975; the string of 24 space
shuttle science, technology and science delivery and rescue flights
that ended with that terrible explosion of Challenger and the death
of seven astronauts in January, 1986. And there was the rebound
from that disaster and the beginning of a new string of shuttle
successes that reached nine with Atlantis' launch early Wednesday.
   The public focus has been on the astronaut flights. But I hold
special fondness for the unmanned satellites and spacecraft that
opened new frontiers and discovered unknown worlds and wondrous
things out there.
   There was the Echo in 1960, a giant balloon shining like a star
in the sky and pointing the way to a communications revolution in
space; the first Tiros weather satellite and the startling weather
photographs it radioed back; the early Explorer satellites that
mapped the radiation belts and other phenomena encircling our
globe; the Pioneer, Mariner, Magellan, Viking and Voyager robots
that probed the planets, revising centuries-old scientific theories.
   The highlight of all those years had to be the moment Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon's Sea of
Tranquillity on Sunday, July 20, 1969.
   For eight years, ever since President Kennedy had set this
nation on a course to the moon, almost everything launched from
Cape Canaveral was a stepping stone to that goal. Mercury proved
man could survive in space. Gemini developed the procedures for
getting there. Almost every unmanned satellite carried devices to
measure radiation and other potential hazards along the route. The
unmanned Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft scouted the
lunar landing sites.
   When Armstrong and Aldrin set foot on the moon, it didn't hit me
at first. I was too busy writing. But hours later, as I stepped
outside the AP office, I looked up at the moon, felt a lump, and
said, ``By gosh, we did it.''
   Yes, the memories are there.
   After Wednesday's Atlantis' launch, several people asked me if I
would miss it.
   Yes, I said, I would. For 31 years I've covered one of history's
best stories. But at some point one has to assess his life and say
its time to move on and make way for someone else to cover the
history yet to come.
   And there is much to come. There will be space station Freedom
in the middle of this decade, and early in the next century
astronauts could be back on the moon and embarking for Mars.
   Those will be exciting days and I wish my successor, Marcia
Dunn, the best of luck.
   I'll still be close to the space program. On Thursday, I will
change hats and become executive director of the Mercury 7
Foundation, founded by the six surviving members of the original
seven astronauts to raise money for science and technology
scholarships.
   I will be located in the new Astronaut Hall of Fame Museum just
outside the gates of the Kennedy Space Center. The foundation
president and my boss will be Alan Shepard. Who would have thought
it 29 years ago when I watched him take wing?
   It's been a facinating ride.
