   The Discovery astronauts breathed
``a little sigh of relief'' after they finished the tricky task of
putting the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit.
   During a news conference this morning from space, the five crew
members said there was little time for talk or celebration
Wednesday when the telescope was released from the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm.
   ``You have to realize that had we just spent a pretty tense time
with a $1.5 billion telescope and we have a couple billion-dollar
orbiter and we just separated the two and we're still within inches
of each other,'' Discovery Commander Loren Shriver said. ``Saying
something was the last thing on my mind.''
   Mission specialist Steve Hawley, who gently guided the robot arm
as it hoisted the Hubble out of the cargo bay, said he didn't
really think about the accomplishment until after it was all over.
   ``Only later in the day when we got a chance to take a breath
and maybe give out a little sigh of relief and think, `Gee, we
actually got it done.' And at that moment I think we were all very
pleased and satisfied to be part of the team that did this,'' he
said.
   Hawley added that there was really only one tense moment during
the telescope's deployment: ``Just the part from beginning to the
end.''
   The crew members took time out today to answer questions radioed
to them from reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. They were spending
most of the day stowing their gear and experiments and testing the
shuttle's control systems in preparation for Sunday's landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were
prepared to perform an emergency space walk Wednesday if there had
been trouble deploying the telescope. They had trained for such a
procedure for years, but one wasn't necessary.
   ``Either one of us was trained and ready to work,'' Sullivan
said.
   Both astronauts already have walked in space on previous
missions, but McCandless admitted to being ``a little disappointed
not to have an EVA,'' for extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk.
   The astronauts agreed that the mission was a special one since
Hubble will enable astronomers to search the heavens for new worlds
and clues to creation itself.
   ``Almost everybody seems to be familiar with what the telescope
is and what it was designed to do,'' Shriver said.
   ``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard
of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' added pilot Charles Bolden. ``It
makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to
learn how to add and subtract and study science.
   ``And that's extremely gratifying to know that you're part of a
mission that seems to have excited the nation as well as the world
about something.''
