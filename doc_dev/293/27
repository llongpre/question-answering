   Two Soviet cosmonauts conducted a 4-hour,
25-minute walk in space Friday to replace a solar battery on the
outside of their Mir space station, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov completed their work ``with the
highest level of professionalism,'' and they were feeling well
after the activity, Tass said.
   They have been aboard the space station since Dec. 21, when they
blasted off from the Central Asian cosmodrome with a third spaceman
aboard the Soyuz TM-4 capsule.
   It was the first space walk from the Mir since Titov and Manarov
took over from cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko, who set a space endurance
record of 325 days during his 1987 mission. Romanenko returned to
Earth on Dec. 29.
   The Mir station, the newest of the two Soviet research complexes
in orbit, was launched Feb. 20, 1986.
