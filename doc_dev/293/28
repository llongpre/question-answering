   WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration plans to announce today that it will cut $8.3
billion from its proposed space station through 1999 by
delaying its launch and simplifying its design.
   NASA had been under orders from Congress to redesign the
program substantially. According to a space agency document
obtained by The Wall Street Journal, NASA plans to reduce the
length of the station 30% -- to 353 feet -- and slash the
number of shuttle flights to assemble the orbiting station
about one-fourth -- to between 23 and 26 flights.

   The launch of the first part of the station would be
delayed by eight months to November 1995, according to the
plan. The station would first be ready for experiments about
a year later and be permanently manned in September 1999, two
years later than expected. At that time, the station would
have a crew of four -- half of what NASA had planned.
   By the end of the decade, NASA estimated, it would spend
$30 billion on the station, rather than the $38.3 billion it
had expected to spend before the congressionally mandated
restructuring. NASA already has spent $3.8 billion designing
the station.
   Even before NASA released its plans, the station
restructuring has stirred up controversy. A panel of the
National Academy of Sciences said the scaled-back station
couldn't be justified on scientific grounds because it was
inadequate for experiments and still cost too much. But
yesterday, Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the
National Space Council, met with lawmakers on science panels
to push the restructuring and released a letter praising the
new design.
   "The most compelling reason for building a space station
is that it is a necessary step to further American leadership
in exploring space," Mr. Quayle said. He added that the
station's importance "is not the size of its span nor the
power of its circuits; it is the size of the dream and the
depth of the commitment it represents."
   From the moment President Reagan proposed the space
station in January 1984, it has been criticized as being
overpriced and unnecessary. As the station's price ballooned
from $8 billion and it fell relentlessly behind schedule, the
criticism grew apace. The restructuring tries to quell the
most recent barbs of critics who claim the station is
unbuildable because it requires astronauts to spend too much
time in space suits assembling the pieces.
   The restructuring envisions assembling more of the basic
truss structure on the ground, and sharply reducing the size
of the laboratory and habitation modules that are attached to
the truss. Those modules will similarly be outfitted on the
ground instead of in orbit, as first planned. As a result,
the NASA document said, space walks by astronauts would be
reduced 50% during station assembly and 40% during
maintenance.
   But the slimmed down station will most likely attract
criticism that it delivers too little for the money. The NASA
document envisions a station that will eventually grow big
enough for a crew of eight, but relegates that to a
"follow-on phase" that may never occur.
