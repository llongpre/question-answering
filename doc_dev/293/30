   Two cosmonauts who have been aboard the Mir
orbiting complex for the past six months will step outside their
spacecraft Thursday to repair a telescope, Radio Moscow said.
   It will be the first space walk for pilot Vladimir Titov and
flight engineer Musa Manarov, who have been in space since Dec. 21,
1987.
   The official radio said ground control had reached the
conclusion the cosmonauts were ready to walk in space, and ``on
Thursday they will repair a telescope.'' It provided no other
details of the space walk.
   Manarov and Titov replaced Alexander Alexandrov and Yuri
Romanenko, who has been in space longer than anyone else: 326 days.
Soviet officials have said the flight by Manarov and Titov will
last about a year, possibly breaking Romanenko's endurance record.
   On June 9, a joint Soviet-Bulgarian crew on a 10-day missioin
docked with the Mir space station.
