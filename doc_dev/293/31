<LEADPARA>  THE son of a late astronaut hopes to bolster public interest in the space race
with baseball-style trading cards depicting scenes from the U.S. space
program.;    Edward H. White III, whose father was the first American to walk
in space, launched his "SpaceShots" collection five months ago, dubbing it
"the trading card of the future."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We want to get kids excited about the space program," said White, 37, who
was an avid baseball-card collector in his youth. "Our primary goal is
education.";    The two-sided color cards picture astronauts in the same
manner as baseball greats, complete with stats and career facts on the back.
They come in an $18 collector's set that includes 110 cards, or a pack of 12
for $1.50 (gum not included).;    The collection depicts historic scenes such
as astronaut Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon, the launch of Apollo 11 and a
colorful shot of the Bay Area taken from a LANDSAT satellite. NASA supplied
all of the pictures, which White personally selected.;    "Each of the cards
tells a story," White said. "We get into all aspects of space exploration.";  
 A new 36-card set released in May features 3-D images of all 11 retired U.S.
astronauts who have walked on the moon. Future sets are slated to include
international space efforts and works of art with a space theme.;    White
said he came up with the idea about three years ago, after reading a sports
column about the price of rare baseball cards.;    The entrepreneur then met
with retired astronauts whom he knew through his father, and obtained
exclusive rights to picture them on the SpaceShots cards.;    One-quarter of
the profits from SpaceShots sales goes to the Center for Space Education at
the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; To
order a complete set, call (800) 748-8853. Packs of 12 cards are available at
Toys 'R' Us stores.  </TEXT>
