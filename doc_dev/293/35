</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four minutes, 30 seconds to liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
Mission control reports that the shuttle has switched to internal power. I 
radio confirmation as my eyes wander over the monitors on the flight deck. 
Outside the forward viewing ports, thin clouds drift through the serene blue of 
the Florida sky. Perfect launch weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovery? Repeat: Do you confirm oxygen vents closed? Over." 
</P>
<P>
What oxygen vents? Something to do with fuel for the main engine? I search 
frantically among the banks of switches for anything that mentions "oxygen." We 
are falling behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two minutes before, the solid engines had ignited and we are 
committed to launch. At last I spot it, an obscure switch labeled "O2." I flip 
it and mumble confirmation over the headset, then glance at the panel again and 
go cold. 
</P>
<P>
I have vented all the oxygen from the sealed cabin. To the right, my pilot, 
"Buzz," a doctor from California, seems unconcerned. He studies the electrical 
system. Behind me, "Bubba," the Midwest carpet dealer, mentally rehearses his 
space walk. 
</P>
<P>
The countdown continues. This motion is going to make for a long two hours. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The equipment and the mission are simulations, but the tension is real at the 
Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a generation that grew up with Sputnik, the Mercury astronauts and 
Apollo on the moon. Imagine a theme park built around space exploration, with 
real NASA training machines, detailed Hollywood mock-ups of the space shuttle, 
and the chance to command a shuttle mission from launch to landing. Add some 
astronauts, a German rocket scientist and the world's most extensive rocket 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The result is U.S. Space Camp, a hands-on program that sets the center apart 
from other collections of space hardware. College-age counselors take children, 
and adults, through a program of lectures and simulations that are no doubt the 
closest most of us will ever get to real space flight. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are divided into five levels -- three for children and two for adults. 
Children in grades 4-6 can attend Space Camp, where they build and launch their 
own model rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the five-day program, kids can taste astronaut food, ride machines 
that simulate moon gravity and explore astronaut training facilities at the 
nearby Marshall Space Flight Center. 
</P>
<P>
The more advanced Space Academy offers a five-day program for children in 
grades 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
Academy Level II trains high school sophomores, juniors and seniors in a 10-day 
program patterned on NASA crew training manuals. The intensive 100-hour course 
includes lectures by rocket engineers and astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
Both adult programs, Levels I and II, are condensed three-day versions of the 
advanced Academy curriculum, including descent into a two-story water tank like 
the system used to teach astronauts the tricks of construction in space. 
</P>
<P>
Any student from grades 4-12 may apply to Space Camp. The application must 
include a recommendation from a classroom or science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
I had never strapped on a tank before, but after some homework and a session 
with certified scuba instructors, I dived 20 feet to experience simulated 
weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
The realities of physics hit home in a new way. A 150-pound steel ball, buoyed 
weightless underwater and shoved gently toward me, still delivered a jolt 
through its properties of inertia and mass. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson: In near-earth orbit, I might be able to "lift" a satellite, but not 
stop it from spinning. 
</P>
<P>
The culmination of each session is a "shuttle mission" combining all the week's 
training in a carefully scripted simulation. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Until midway through our flight, our crew's mission specialists sit patiently, 
with only an occasional radio report to make. Now it is time for their 
"extra-vehicular activity" -- the space walk. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant helps them into bulky space suits. They get into white rubber 
boots and helmets and take their places for the satellite-repair exercise. 
</P>
<P>
One is strapped into a parachute harness attached by cables to a track far 
overhead. The other steps onto a large mechanical arm like the one used in the 
repair of phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
The first figure glides out over the shuttle bay like a space age Peter Pan. 
The second jerks the arm in fits and starts, up and over, to rendezvous near a 
shiny satellite replica above the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
This is a quiet time for the commander and pilot, so the counselor overseeing 
our mission secretly throws a switch on his command panel. 
</P>
<P>
A red light on our emergency panel flashes "Fire." The pilot and I flip through 
our emergency cards to find the fire control procedure. We expected something 
like this, and in less than a minute the light is out. We are getting cocky. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Not everything runs like clockwork. Coordinating training and machinery for 
three or more groups simultaneously leads to some confusion and down time. 
</P>
<P>
During my visit, a jet cockpit trainer was out of commission and one of the 
microgravity simulators, which ride on a cushion of air, had a balky hose. A 
special early-morning session to rehearse mission assignments started late with 
a collection of drowsy counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Agendas for the advanced programs are packed. Twelve-hour days are the norm. 
Breaks for sightseeing are scheduled during each session; the staff reminds 
participants that the experience is, after all, supposed to be fun. 
</P>
<P>
Campers' families or others who just want to visit for the day can find less 
demanding activities. 
</P>
<P>
The center's Spacedome Theater features movies filmed in the huge new Omnimax 
format like the ones shown at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, 
D.C. But here films are projected overhead on a shallow planetarium-type 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
A shuttle launch vibrated our reclining chairs with the rolling thunder. Later 
we "oohed" and "aahed" like spectators at a fireworks show as panoramas of 
Earth and the crisp starkness of space filled our field of vision. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
The idea of a museum that would allow children to take part in the excitement 
of space travel was first promoted by Wernher von Braun, the German rocket 
genius who immigrated to the United States after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The museum and rocket park opened in 1970. In 1982, the first U.S. Space Camp 
program was offered, attracting 747 children. The center later added the 
advanced sessions for teen-agers and adults. Annual attendance at this 
three-ring space circus is up to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The center is run by the state of Alabama and receives sizable donations of 
equipment, money and expertise from NASA and a group of aerospace contractors 
and local corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Campers bunk in compact six-person "sleep stations" in the new 
multimillion-dollar Space Habitat dormitory, whose futuristic design was 
inspired by NASA's proposed space station. Counselors provide supervision. 
</P>

<P>
The runway at Edwards Air Force Base rises ahead of us. I begin the first of 
the broad S-turns that will allow us to glide in at the right speed and 
heading. 
</P>
<P>
I ease the control stick to one side. The hydraulics slowly tip the whole cabin 
in that direction. I steer back the other way, and again the cabin tilts in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
I am so intent on keeping the craft centered that I almost forget about landing 
gear. Wait, that's the pilot's job. "Buzz, get the gear." More fumbling. Armed, 
deployed, on the ground, with two seconds to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Buzz says nothing, pretending to recheck the switches. Bubba can't wait to 
rehash the mission over lunch. I decide to sit here a minute and come down to 
earth. 
</P>

The U.S. Space Camp program has been so successful that an affiliate center 
(grades 4-7) opened last year, adjacent to the Kennedy Space Center on the east 
coast of Florida, sponsored in part by NASA's original Mercury astronauts 
through their Mercury 7 Foundation. Nippon Steel has been licensed to open a 
Space World franchise in Japan next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The center has a snack bar for fast food, and a cafeteria. Campers eat all 
meals at the cafeteria. An informal poll rated the food hot, varied and 
unexceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Family members can stay at the Huntsville Marriott a short walk away. It offers 
the usual Marriott facilities including restaurants, and advertises a special 
Space Camp family rate. Call the hotel at (205) 830-2222. 
</P>
<P>
Programs for both young campers and academy participants run all year. All 
adult programs take place Friday through Sunday in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The center recommends early registration for Space Camp and Space Academy 
programs. Easter holidays and June and July programs fill quickly. Many schools 
provide credit for students who must miss classes to attend the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Tuition, which includes meals, lodging and all activities, ranges from $425 for 
the five-day Space Camp fall session to $800 for the 10-day Level II Space 
Academy summer session. Scholarships are available. Adult sessions cost $450.
