   ``That's one small step for a man,
one giant leap for mankind.''
   Twenty years have passed, nearly a generation, since Neil
Armstrong called those momentous words down from the moon.
   Two decades since Earthlings watched those flickering television
images, saw that tentative first step on the dusty surface and
looked on in wonder as two Americans hopped about in weak gravity,
planted and saluted their flag, picked up bits of lunar treasure and
spoke with their president a quarter million miles away.
   Most people living then can tell you today where they were when
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took those first steps on
the moon Sunday, July 20, 1969.
   They were realizing a goal that John F. Kennedy had set in
frustration and desperation.
   Kennedy came to office in January 1961 with a pledge to ``get
this country moving again.'' The economy was sluggish, Fidel Castro
had taken over Cuba, and the United States trailed the Soviets in
the highly visible arena of space.
   The space chasm widened April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut
Yuri A. Gagarin blasted into orbit, the first man to fly in space.
   American prestige was rocked again five days later. On April 17,
a brigade of Cuban exiles, sponsored by the Central Intelligence
Agency, stormed the beach at Cuba's Bay of Pigs in an effort to
overthrow Castro. His forces routed the ill-equipped exiles, leaving
the United States and its young president in shame and disarray.
   Kennedy accepted the blame and decided bold action was needed to
restore America's honor. Space was the answer, he concluded, and he
gave Vice President Lyndon Johnson the task of determining what
could be done.
   On April 28, the National Aeronautics and Space Council, which
Johnson chaired, submitted a preliminary report to the president.
``The moon is a good target for us,'' it said.
   Even as the president and his advisers were discussing moon
trips, some in the administration were concerned about the first
U.S. man-in-space flight, now set for May 2. With everything going
wrong for the nation, the impact of a failure could be devastating.
   But Kennedy let the launch date stand, and, on May 5, after a
three-day weather delay, astronaut Alan Shepard rode a slender
Redstone rocket and a cramped Mercury capsule 115 miles up and 302
miles down the Atlantic tracking range on a 15-minute suborbital
flight.
   America heaved a sigh of relief. The Soviets were still ahead,
but the United States was on the move.
   On May 25, four months after taking office, Kennedy delivered a
special State of the Union message on urgent national needs. It
covered many subjects, from the economy to disarmament. It also
dealt with space.
   ``I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the
goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this
period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important to the
long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or
expensive to accomplish.''
   The project was called Apollo _ after the Greek archer-god, the
god of light and truth, bright-shining, far-shooting.
   Christopher C. Kraft Jr., who would become flight operations
director for Apollo, was a NASA engineer working on the Mercury
project.
   ``I thought he had lost his mind,'' Kraft said of Kennedy and his
bold commitment. ``We had a total of 15 minutes of manned
spaceflight experience, we hadn't flown Mercury in orbit yet, and
here's a guy telling me we're going to fly to the moon. ... Doing it
was one thing, but doing it in this decade was to me too risky.''
   Despite the doubts of Kraft and others within NASA, America's
biggest, costliest and most ambitious technological effort began
with virtually no dissent. Before it was achieved, more than 20,000
industrial contractors and 420,000 technicians, engineers and other
skilled persons would be involved.
   While the hardware of Apollo was being developed and tested,
Americans and Russians were learning to live and work in space and
to perfect the rockets, spaceships and techniques for going to the
moon.
   To a watching world, it was like a relay race in space. The
Russians, with their larger booster rockets and larger manned
spacecraft, held the early lead.
   John Glenn in 1962 was hailed as America's first orbital
champion. Three more Mercury orbital flights proved man could
survive and function for at least a short time in weightless space.
   NASA moved on in 1965 to the two-man Gemini program, and 10
exciting flights in 20 months tested and proved all the rendezvous
and docking and space walking procedures needed to travel to the
moon.
   The Russians, too, were perfecting these techniques. But by early
1967, as the United States was ready to move into manned Apollo
flights, America seemed to have a slight lead, based on superior
computer and other technologies.
   Then, tragedy.
   In a countdown test on Jan. 27, 1967, a month before the planned
launch, faulty wiring released a spark that touched off an inferno
inside the Apollo 1 cabin. The flames, intensified by the 100
percent oxygen environment, incinerated the three-man crew, Gus
Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee.
   Three months after the Apollo fire, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov
rode into orbit in a new spacecraft named Soyuz, believed to be a
test model for a lunar command ship. After a day in orbit, as he
returned to Earth, Soyuz 1 tumbled, became tangled in its parachute
straps and crashed. Komarov became the world's first in-flight space
casualty.
   In both countries, critics brought their guns to bear on both
space programs. Each was halted for nearly two years while repairs
were made.
   Apollo was reexamined, rewired, redesigned and finally flew.
Apollo 7 orbited the Earth for 11 days in October 1968, and then, in
a bold move, NASA officials decided to fly the three-man Apollo 8
crew into orbit about the moon on Christmas Eve 1968.
   They reasoned the flight would provide vital information about
navigating to and around the moon, buy time while the lagging lunar
landing module was readied, and rob the Soviets of any glory they
might reap by looping one man once around the backside of the moon
on a translunar trajectory; there was a widely reported rumor that
the Soviets were ready to do just that.
   The mission was a huge, uplifting success, and two more flights,
one in which two astronauts swooped to within 10 miles of the lunar
surface, set the stage for the main event, Apollo 11.
   More than 1 million people _ tourists, congressmen, diplomats,
business people, reporters and movie stars _ came to watch the
launch at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969. All eyes stared
at the sheet of flame as the mighty Saturn 5 rose ponderously from
Launch Pad 39A, precisely on schedule at 9:32 a.m., and sent a
thunderclap across the scrubland.
   In the spaceship on the tip of the rocket were Neil Alden
Armstrong, 38, a civilian, the commander; Air Force Col. Edwin
Eugene Aldrin Jr., 39, the lunar module pilot, and Air Force Lt.
Col. Michael Collins, 38, the command module pilot _ ambassadors
from planet Earth headed for a target 250,801 miles away.
