<HEAD>Space Agency to Review Space Walk Requirements</HEAD>

   NASA, reacting to criticism about the number
of astronaut space walks that will be needed to maintain the
proposed space station, said Wednesday it will review its
requirements and report the results to Congress.
   NASA said that on Friday it will review the status of an ongoing
study of the space-walk requirements. The announcement made no
reference to two articles in the New York Times this week that
prompted the review.
   On Monday, the Times reported that an internal NASA
investigation showed 2,200 hours of space walks would be required
each year, 5{ times as long as all U.S. space walks to date. It
said the study found the station could not be built as designed
because its parts would begin to break down before the station was
completed in the late 1990s.
   On Wednesday, the newspaper quoted Dr. William Fisher, a
co-leader of a NASA investigative panel, as challenging his bosses
for saying the findings were ``a worst case scenario.'' Fisher, an
astronaut, said his team had been done a disservice by implication
its efforts were ``somehow not credible simply because the results
are unpopular.''
   Fisher said ``our ongoing investigation may well show the
problem to be even greater than our preliminary figures would
indicate.''
   NASA said Richard H. Truly, the agency's administrator, will
conduct Friday's review. Others taking part, in addition to Fisher,
will include Charles Price, the other co-leader; William Lenoir,
who heads NASA's space flight program; Richard Kohrs, director of
the space station program, and officials from the Johnson Space
Center.
