   Astronaut Robert C. Springer had hoped
something might go wrong on the five-day voyage of Discovery so he
could leave the space shuttle to fix it, his mother says.
   ``Bob was hoping for just some little problem so he could take a
space walk,'' Betty Springer said Sunday from her son's home in
Seabrook, Texas.
   Instead, the flight was almost perfect, which suited Mrs. Spring
fine.
   The only problem concerned an erratic pressure reading from a
hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the orbiter. The
astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground controllers
corrected the difficulty.
   Mrs. Springer and her husband, Walter, watched the shuttle take
off in Cape Canaveral, then went to Houston and watched on TV the
landing Saturday.
   Springer, a 46-year-old mission specialist aboard the shuttle,
returned to his home in the Houston suburbs after the landing.
   ``It still seems like a dream, but he really liked his trip up
into space,'' his mother said.
   Springer was born in Ashland, Ohio, where his parents still live.
