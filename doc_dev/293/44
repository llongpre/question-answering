   Buzz Aldrin laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and Neil Armstrong left the first human
footprints on the moon two decades ago.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, Aldrin
is not too hopeful.
   President Bush is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
NASA's program when he meets with Aldrin, Armstrong and their
command module pilot, Michael Collins, on July 20, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that Congress must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
Congress is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President John F. Kennedy had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the 1960s. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the Soviet Union, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the United States won the race to the moon, NASA laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head Thomas Paine in 1969
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as 1976, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in Earth orbit and a manned
mission to Mars in the 1980s.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in Vietnam, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said Paine, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The Ford and Carter administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   NASA had gained some hope from President Reagan's endorsement of
a strong space program and from his 1984 State of the Union message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In 1985, Congress created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was Thomas Paine, the former NASA administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, Paine stood in the Oval Office and
gave Reagan a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of Paine's 1969 plan.
   Reagan two years later signed a Presidential Directive on
National Space Policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system.''
   Reagan's policy set in motion a NASA program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   Bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the National Space Council, headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for Bush's
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   NASA needs a decision from Congress soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   Bush has requested $2.05 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that Congress will
trim that by $400 million to $700 million, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with America's major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, Japan and Canada agreed to invest nearly $8
billion to build sections of it.
   NASA said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the U.S. cost at $8
billion. In 1987, agency officials revised the pricetag to $14.6
billion. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a National Research Council panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the White House said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be $25.02
billion, with Phase Two raising the cost to $32.8 billion.
   The schedule began slipping. And NASA now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in 1995.
   Some in Congress believe NASA should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to Earh after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on Earth.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the moon 20 years ago think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' Neil Armstrong said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said Buzz Aldrin.
   Michael Collins, who orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
East Coast, we went to the West Coast, and then vertically. Starting
with the Wright brothers, Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier,
Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''
