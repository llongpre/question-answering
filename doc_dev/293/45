Jean-Loup Chretien? - ah yes, he's Canada's new prime minister, isn't he?
Wrong. That's Jean Chretien. His near namesake was the first west European
astronaut.
Jean-Loup, a French Air Force general, became a by-word for savoir faire in
his two cosmic jaunts aboard Soviet rockets in 1982 and 1988. He astounded
his Russian hosts by taking along meals of jellied salmon, quail meat and
crystallised fruit, and on his second trip not only did he enter the record
books by surviving for several hours on a space walk outside the Mir space
station, he also managed to fight off a tax demand from the French
government by saying he was away in orbit.
The new Canadian PM may feel he is walking on air, but his officials are
unlikely to be palmed off with such dizzy excuses.
