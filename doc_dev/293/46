<HEAD>Remedy for a Space Cold: Stay Indoors and Plenty of Vitamin C</HEAD>

   Soviet space officials have ordered an
old-fashioned remedy for a cosmonaut who caught a cold: take lots
of vitamin C and stay indoors.
   That meant postponing a space walk Wednesday because Gennady
Strekalov, 49, one of two cosmonauts on the orbiting Soviet space
station Mir, caught a cold while working out on an on-board running
track, the official news agency Tass said.
   The space walk was rescheduled for Oct. 30.
   ``A cosmonaut is, naturally, not a robot or automaton. He
remains an ordinary human and, unfortunatey, is susceptible to
ailments lurking in his path even in orbit,'' said Valery Polyakov,
deputy director of the Health Ministry's Institute for
Medical-Biological Problems.
   Tass said Strekalov was taking ascorbic acid, or vitamin C.
Soviet physicians on Earth said no other medicine was necessary.
   Strekalov and Gennady Manakov were to take space walks to make
final repairs on a hatch that failed to close this summer.
