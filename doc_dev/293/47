   Two Soviet cosmonauts from the Mir space station
took a walk in space today to repair a telescope but were unable to
complete the job after more than five hours, the Tass news agency
said.
   The report said Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov were outside the
station for five hours and 10 minutes trying to replace a detector
unit on an X-ray telescope. The telescope is on the Kvant orbiting
observatory, which is attached to the Mir.
   Tass later said the work was incomplete and would have to be
resumed later. It was unclear whether the unit was replaced or what
work remained to be done.
   The cosmonauts left the Mir station at 9:33 a.m., Tass said. It
said they had some problems unfastening the clasp holding the
detector unit to the telescope.
   Tass said a new detector would permit the telescope to be used
for a longer period.
   The cosmonauts made a similar walk on Feb. 20 to replace a solar
battery. That walk lasted four hours and 25 minutes.
   Titov and Manarov took over from cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko on
Dec. 21 when they blasted off from the Central Asian cosmodrome.
Romanenko returned to Earth on Dec. 29 after a space endurance
record of 325 days.
   The Mir station, the newest of the two Soviet research complexes
in orbit, was launched Feb. 20, 1986. The Kvant orbiting
observatory was attached to it in early 1987, and Soviet scientists
have been using the space complex for a series of observations and
experiments.
