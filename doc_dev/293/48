   Two Soviet cosmonauts from the Mir space station took a walk in space today to repair a telescope but were unable to complete the job after five hours, the Soviet government's news agency said. 

   Tass said Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov were outside the station for five hours and 10 minutes trying to replace a detector unit on an X-ray telescope. 
The telescope is on the Kvant orbiting observatory, which is attached to the Mir. 

   Tass later said the work was incomplete and would have to be resumed later. 
It was unclear whether the unit was replaced or what work remained to be done. 

   The cosmonauts left the Mir station at 9:33 a.m., Tass said. 
It said they had some problems unfastening the clasp holding the detector unit to the telescope. 
Tass said a new detector would permit the telescope to be used for a longer period. 

   The cosmonauts made a similar walk lasting four hours and 25 minutes on Feb. 20 to replace a solar battery. 

   Messrs. 
Titov and Manarov took over from cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko on Dec. 21 when they blasted off from the Central Asian cosmodrome. 
Mr. Romanenko returned to Earth Dec. 29 after a space endurance record of 325 days. 

   The Mir station, the newest of the two Soviet research complexes in orbit, was launched Feb. 20, 1986. 
The Kvant orbiting observatory was attached to it in early 1987, and Soviet scientists have been using the space complex for a series of observations and experiments.
