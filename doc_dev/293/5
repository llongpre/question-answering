   An internal NASA study concludes that
astronauts will have to spend 75 percent more time spacewalking to
maintain the space station than previously thought, a congressman
said Wednesday.
   ``It's going in the wrong direction, not the right direction,''
Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., said in a telephone interview.
   Green, the ranking minority member of the appropriations
subcommittee that oversees NASA spending, said his staff had seen
some of the same gloomy forecasts as The New York Times, which
published the results in its Wednesday editions.
   NASA has said it will make the document public next week, along
with plans to reduce the number of space walks through design
changes and other means. The agency declined requests to make the
study public immediately.
   The space station's top official, William B. Lenoir, has
maintained that the estimates would be high but that the number
could be cut sharply.
   Green said the maintenance requirements were only one issue. The
other, he said, is the limited amount of electrical power that
appears to be available for microgravity experiments on the station.
   NASA plans initially to have 75 kilowatts of power, of which 45
kilowatts will be needed for housekeeping.
   Green said that if NASA can't bring maintenance under control or
provide enough power to be useful, it might be time to change
designs.
   ``One has to look at the possibility that if the situation
continues to deteriorate in terms of safety and the capacity of the
station, there comes a point where we say, `Hey, this design is not
working' and maybe go back to the design this country had,
Skylab,'' Green said.
   The Skylab program in 1973 and 1974 involved sets of three
astronauts working inside the orbiting laboratory for periods of
28, 56 and 84 days.
   The space station, whose cost has more than tripled from the $8
billion estimate when President Reagan proposed it in 1984, is in
the preliminary design phase. A review late this year will lead to
the start of detailed designs.
   A preliminary report in March by a 12-member team headed by Dr.
William J. Fisher, an astronaut, and Charles R. Price, a robotics
engineer, found the station would need more than 2,200 hours of
maintenance each year, far more than the 130 hours that had been
budgeted.
   The New York Times said the final report expects that more than
3,800 hours of spacewalking time would be needed. To date,
astronauts have logged 400 hours of space walks, each a risky
exercise.
   ``You can't do it as currently designed,'' the newspaper quoted
an unnamed engineer. ``You have to build a different station.''
   Green said the space station would be useful for two major
tasks: learning what happens when humans spend extended time in
space and processing materials in a near-zero gravity environment.
   Congress is considering a request of $2.5 billion for the
station in the next fiscal year. The first elements of the station
are expected to be put into orbit early in 1995, with completion
some 28 flights later in 1999.
