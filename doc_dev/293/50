   Two cosmonauts who made emergency repairs outside
their damaged spacecraft said Friday that the job demanded a cool
head, but they denied earlier reports they had risked running out
of oxygen.
   The 179-day mission by Alexander Solovyev and Alexander
Balandin, which ended with their return to Earth on Aug. 9, is
expected to show a $21 million profit, the deputy mission chief
said. He said it is the first in the 33-year history of the Soviet
space program.
   The two cosmonauts walked in space for seven hours on July 17 to
repair insulation surrounding the space capsule that would take
them back to Earth. Before finishing the repairs, they discovered a
problem with the porthole leading back to the orbiting space
station Mir, forcing them to return through an emergency hatch.
Soviet media reported their life support supplies were running
dangerously low by the time they returned to Mir.
   Solovyev told a news conference Friday each cosmonaut had 10
hours of oxygen in their main tank, plus reserve supplies.
   ``We consumed only two-thirds of our main balloon of oxygen ...
so we had reserves,'' he said.
   He said the spacewalk was one of the hardest moments of the
mission, but that cosmonauts train for such crises.
   ``I'm sure that men who are not prepared, who do not expect such
situations, will not cope with it,'' Solovyev said. ``In that
situation, we were quite calm, even cold-blooded, if I may say so,
about the decisions we were taking.''
   The cosmonauts made a second space walk on July 26 to finish the
repairs and retrieve some equipment they left behind, attached to
the capsule's exterior.
   Deputy mission chief Viktor Blagov told the news conference that
the mission, the sixth to the orbiting space station, cost $134
million.
   But he forecast revenue of $155 million through the sale of
high-definition photographs of the Earth's surface and of pure
crystals developed in space for use in semiconductors and computer
chips.
   ``So from a program of scientific investigation, it is being
turned into a program for economic benefit,'' Blagov said.
   The Soviet space program, for decades a source of national
pride, has come under increasing pressure in recent years to prove
its worth as the country grapples with consumer shortages and other
economic woes.
   For the last two years, the program has suffered from docking
equipment malfunctions, mistakes by cosmonauts and budget cuts.
   Blagov said the space program will continue to put even more
emphasis on commercial activities.
   The Soviets have also agreed to take a paying customer into
space in December. Two employees of the Tokyo Broadcasting System
are vying for the seat.
