   Twenty years after the first moon
walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar
surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is
unlikely soon.
   Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, at a ceremony
Sunday commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on
July 16, 1969, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program.
   On Thursday, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with
President Bush for a celebration outside the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   There, Bush will deliver a speech on space policy. Some are
pressing him to announce a return to the moon, while others are
pushing for an exploration to Mars. Many scientists are suggesting a
joint U.S.-Soviet exploration for either option.
   Bush said in Paris on Sunday he was weighing different ideas.
   At Cape Canaveral, Armstrong, told 6,000 flag-waving space
workers and their families Sunday that they should ``allow ourselves
just a touch of pride, a touch of satisfaction, that we were
participants and witnesses to the birth of a new human era.''
   He said historians in future centuries will identify the 20th
century ``as the time when the human species broke the bonds of
gravity that had heretofore bound them to this planet.''
   In brief remarks, Aldrin, who walked on the moon with Armstrong,
and Collins, who remained in lunar orbit in the command ship, looked
to future space exploration.
   ``One of these years, and I hope it won't be too long, this
country will decide to press on again far out into space, perhaps to
the planet Mars,'' Collins said.
   Aldrin said NASA's Freedom space station, to be assembled in
orbit in the mid-1990s, should serve as a stepping stone to a manned
lunar base and human flights to Mars.
   He called President John F. Kennedy's commitment to the moon
landing goal 28 years ago ``a starter's gun for our pioneering giant
leap for mankind.''
   ``We're not yet ready for that go again. But perhaps we are at
the starting line, prepared to take our marks or get set,'' Aldrin
said.
   Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a
20-mile-motorcade from the space center to Cocoa Beach, where they
attended a luncheon in their honor. An estimated 10,000 people lined
the route to cheer the spacemen and to take pictures.
   For Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, the ceremony was the second
stop on a week-long sentimental journey that began Saturday with a
visit to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., where
their Saturn 5 rocket was designed.
   In Huntsville on Sunday, Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean had a more
pessimistic view of space exploration in the near future.
   Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon, said that until the
Soviet Union decides to put a man on the moon or take some other
such step, Americans will be complacent about their space
achievements.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   Bean, who walked on the moon on Nov. 19, 1969, and later flew
aboard Skylab 3 for 59 days in 1973, said he didn't want to see
another 1960s-style space race.
   ``I'd rather have space cooperation. I'd think that would be much
better for the Earth,'' he said.
