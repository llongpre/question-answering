<LEADPARA>  Atlantis thundered into orbit today with five astronauts and an immense
observatory that will stalk the hottest, most powerful rays in the heavens.;  
 Spewing flame from twin booster rockets, the shuttle roared from its seaside
launch pad at 6:23 a.m. PST. It cleared the tower and headed out over the
Atlantic Ocean.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The sky was cloudy after a morning of rain. The weather made the launch
five minutes late.;    "No drama," NASA launch director Bob Sieck said of the
countdown. "We had a safe and successful launch.";    The rockets burned for
two minutes and dropped empty into the Atlantic about 130 miles down-range,
where ships were waiting to pick them up. The 100-ton shuttle reached orbit 6
1/2 minutes later on the thrust of its three main engines.;    Except for the
failure of one of several thrusters during ascent, a minor problem that is not
expected to affect the flight, "all systems aboard Atlantis appear to be
performing exceptionally well," said Mission Control's Jeff Carr.;    It was
the 39th launch of a shuttle and the first of 1991, after a hiatus of four
months. Gone were worries over tiny cracks in a door-opening mechanism of
Atlantis that had grounded another shuttle. The two doors on the belly of the
orbiter shut tightly after the fuel tank dropped off, Carr said.;    "We were
confident that was going to work," Sieck said.;    The main event of the
flight, which will last five days, is the release of the Gamma Ray
Observatory. Mission Cmdr. Steve Nagel and his crew of four will place the
spacecraft in a 279-mile-high orbit on Sunday.;    On Monday, astronauts Jerry
Ross and Jay Apt are scheduled to take the first space walk by Americans in
more than five years. They are to spend six hours in the open cargo bay
testing equipment that would be needed to build a space station.;    Also
during the mission, pilot Kenneth Cameron, astronaut Linda Godwin and the
others will use a ham radio to contact schoolchildren and other amateur radio
operators around the world. They also hope to reach cosmonauts aboard the
Soviet space station Mir.;    The 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory, the heaviest
science satellite ever lifted by a shuttle, will circle the Earth for at least
two years in its quest for gamma rays.;    "The study of gamma rays opens a
new window not only to the universe but to a whole new realm of physical
activities," said Charles Pellerin, director of NASA's astrophysics division.;
   "You have the real possibility of seeing phenomena that have not been
observed before and perhaps have not been imagined before," NASA chief
scientist Lennard Fisk said.;    The Gamma Ray Observatory, known as GRO, is
the second in NASA's series of Great Observatories. The first is the Hubble
Space Telescope, which was placed in orbit last April to examine visible light
from objects billions of years old.;    While the Hubble does its work in the
relatively narrow bands of the visible spectrum, gathering light that
originated billions of years ago, the GRO operates at the extreme far end --
beyond ultraviolet and X-rays.;    In that range, it monitors energies ranging
from 20,000 to more than 30 billion electron volts. Gamma rays are born often
in cataclysms that flourish in black holes, quasars, pulsars and supernova
explosions.;    The rays do not penetrate Earth's atmosphere. If they did, the
sky would be a flashing, violent sight.  </TEXT>
