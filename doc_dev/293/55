   NASA's last-ditch effort to fix
Atlantis' hydrogen leak on the launch pad failed Wednesday, forcing
the trouble-plagued agency to postpone the space shuttle's flight
until later this year.
   NASA engineers, who had hoped to avoid a long launch delay by
quickly repairing the leak on the pad, said the shuttle must be
returned to the hangar for more work. It had been scheduled for a
secret military mission this month.
   Shuttle Columbia, still under repairs because of a different
sort of hydrogen leak which scrubbed a May launch, will be the next
shuttle to fly. It is scheduled for an astronomy mission in early
September, and NASA says it expects the leak to be fixed in time.
   The developments came as a space agency team began probing the
cause of NASA's highest-profile problem: the flawed mirror on the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   The seven-member team, led by Lew Allen, director of NASA's jet
propulsion laboratory, took testimony in secret Wednesday at
Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., the maker of the mirror.
   The flaw has halved the effectiveness of the telescope, which
was put in orbit on an April shuttle mission.
   NASA, facing mounting criticism in Congress because of the
string of setbacks, got one piece of good news Wednesday: A
thrice-delayed Atlas rocket launch finally went off without a flaw.
   The rocket carried a government device designed to study
electric fields in space and the Van Allen radiation fields.
   ``It's good to have something positive happen,'' said NASA
spokesman Jim Cast. ``It's a definite boost to NASA morale.''
   The Atlas launch had been delayed three times, because of a
power problem, bad weather and a helium leak.
   On the shuttle, experts had hoped Atlantis' problem could be
solved by simple launch pad repairs. But the leak reappeared during
a test Wednesday and, after analyzing the data, engineers concluded
they still didn't fully understand the problem.
   ``We were not able to fix it. We have learned more so we will
roll back smarter,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space
flight program.
   NASA will try to launch Atlantis on its classified Pentagon
flight in November.
   The latest leak, detected when liquid hydrogen was pumped into
Atlantis' external fuel tank, was about the size of the leak
detected in two previous tests and was in the same area, a flange
in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to the main
engines.
   Workers tightened bolts around the flange and checked the welds,
even though engineers doubted that would be enough to correct the
problem.
   Had the spot been leak-free Wednesday, NASA would have tried to
launch Atlantis in mid-August and Columbia in September.
   Now officials intend to get Columbia ready to move to the launch
pad in early August, said shuttle director Robert Crippen.
   NASA officials want to get at least one shuttle up before
Discovery's October mission with Ulysses, a satellite that will
explore the sun's poles. Discovery has a 19-day ``window'' in which
it must lift off or the mission will be delayed 13 months. That
would be the next time Earth is in proper alignment again with the
sun and Jupiter.
   If NASA hadn't tried to fix Atlantis at the launch pad, ``we
would have forever wondered if we could have gotten two off before
Ulysses,'' Lenoir said.
   The delay in launching Atlantis means NASA must bump yet another
mission into next year. The space agency originally had planned
nine shuttle flights for 1990, but now is down to seven. So far,
only three have been flown.
   Columbia had been due to lift off May 30 with the $150 million
Astro observatory for study of ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted
by stars and other celestial objects. Columbia's leak was detected
during fueling, six hours before liftoff.
   The space agency has since replaced Columbia's leaky plumbing
with components from the unfinished shuttle Endeavour. Columbia's
leak is believed to be larger than the one plaguing Atlantis and in
a different place.
   Crippen said it's too soon to say how Atlantis' leaky fuel line
will be repaired. One option is to attach a new external tank.
   The discovery of Atlantis' first leak, on June 29, prompted NASA
to temporarily ground its three-shuttle fleet. The leak reappeared
during a more elaborate test two weeks later.
   The Hubble telescope isn't expected to fulfill its potential
until space-walking astronauts make repairs in 1993.
   Allen of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said the Hubble probers
hoped to find what Allen called a ``smoking gun and a fingerprint
on the trigger.''
   Investigators, who expected to stay through Thursday, also
planned to examine reams of data pertaining to the manufacturing
and testing of the mirror, and equipment used to test the accuracy
of the mirror.
   NASA's proposed space station Freedom also is under attack.
Studies show the station will require more maintenance than is
feasible unless major design changes are made.
