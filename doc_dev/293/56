<LEADPARA>  A simpler, more modest plan for NASA's space station is taking shape after
budget cuts and the discovery of design flaws sent architects back to the
drawing board.;    The orbiting outpost, first proposed by President Reagan
seven years ago, is still largely a castle in the clouds, even though $3.9
billion has been spent on studies and prototype parts.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Until last year, the goal of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration was to build a 508-foot-long, 300-ton facility housing up to
eight astronauts.;    The structure was to be lofted piecemeal by the space
shuttle in the mid- to late 1990s and would have cost $37 billion, not
including operating expenses.;    That plan was faulted as being costly and
defective.;    NASA's own experts said the vast complex -- nearly the size of
the Capitol building in Washington -- would need up to 3,700 hours of
maintenance a year by space-suited astronauts, 28 times the original aim of
130 hours.;    According to internal NASA documents, the station's size and
cost now are to be reduced, its astronaut crew cut in half and its
construction and repair made easier, among scores of other changes.;    Most
important, the envisioned design will break NASA's longstanding practice of
trying to make the space station all things to all people.;    Gone are plans
for experiments to study the stars and the Earth, once pursued by a dozen
science teams around the country.;    Gone too are dreams of making the
outpost a staging area for human forays to the moon and Mars.;    What remains
are plans to study the long-term effects of space on astronauts and other
living things (essential to judging the biological feasibility of a Mars
voyage) and to determine whether the environment of near-weightlessness offers
commercial possibilities for such processes as growing near-perfect crystals
and forging exceptionally pure metals.;    The principal question is whether
the slimmed-down station, which has lost constituents but not critics, will
survive congressional review in a time of budget austerity.;    "I think it's
going to fly," said John M. Logsdon, director of the space policy institute at
George Washington University and a station historian. "NASA has finally gotten
and responded to the idea of downsizing our ambitions to match our
resources.";    A White House official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said planning for the space station had reached the end of the road
after undergoing six major changes of direction in as many years.;    "The
program might not survive if this redesign doesn't fly," the official said.;  
 The latest jolt in the station's course was ordered late last year by
Congress and a White House panel after a series of problems emerged, including
a charge by astronauts that the structure's design was fundamentally flawed.; 
  William F. Fisher, an astronaut who led a team that found impossibly
ambitious maintenance requirements, recently quit NASA and warned that the
space station might be canceled outright if its redesign were superficial.;   
Logsdon noted that Congress probably would continue to support the space
station, despite voicing doubts about the project.  </TEXT>
