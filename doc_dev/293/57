   Two Soviet cosmonauts will apparently be making an
unscheduled space walk to try to repair a thermal blanket that has
partially ripped apart and could interfere with their safe return
to Earth.
   Part of the thermal blanket has been flapping uselessly in space
for months.
   Soviet officials have extended the stay of Anatoly Solovyev and
Alexander Balandin aboard the orbiting space station Mir until Aug.
9 to give them extra time to make the repair, the newspapers
Izvestia and Trud report.
   They had been scheduled to return July 30 after nearly six
months in space.
   It was the latest in a series of problems in the Soviet Union's
manned space program, which for decades has been a source of
national pride. For the past two years, the program has been
plagued by docking equipment malfunctions, human error and budget
cuts.
   Solovyev and Balandin plan to take the previously unscheduled
space walk on July 17 to repair a thermal blanket covering their
Soyuz TM-9 capsule, which is docked to Mir.
   The two newspapers said in reports Saturday that the capsule _
while it is casting off _ could collide with the space station.
   Soviet officials have minimized the danger, and Izvestia said
scientists in Moscow determined the capsule could withstand the
damage to its thermal blanket.
   James Oberg, an American specialist on the Soviet space program,
agreed.
   ``I don't think there's danger. I think there's anxiety over
something more going wrong,'' Oberg said in a telephone interview
Sunday from his Texas home.
   Nearly half the thermal blanket has separated from the capsule
and a yard-long section is hanging off, attached only on one side,
Trud said.
   The damage probably occurred during launch of the capsule on
Feb. 11, Izvestia quoted deputy flight director Viktor Blagov as
saying.
