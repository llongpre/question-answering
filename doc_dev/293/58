SPACE FLIGHT: WHEN ASTRONAUTS AND COSMONAUTS GATHER, THERE IS NO RIVALRY, ONLY

<DATELINE>
<P>
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the dunes of the Al-Thuamalah desert, 50 kilometers from this capital of 
Saudi Arabia, a bus made in Japan, bearing American astronauts and Soviet 
cosmonauts, got hopelessly stuck in axle-deep sand while trying to reach a 
Bedouin encampment for dinner under a full moon. 
</P>
<P>
The space fliers, in the Saudi kingdom last month for their annual meeting of 
the Assn. of Space Explorers, proceeded in good humor to try pushing the 
trapped vehicle free with their combined muscle power. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, failure. 
</P>
<P>
Aleksei Leonov, the bald, jovial Soviet cosmonaut who was the first to walk in 
space at the end of a tether, shrugged in mock exasperation and said in 
rough-edged but passable English: 
</P>
<P>
"Gentlemen, we have spent the afternoon in meetings discussing how to rescue 
each other in space in the event of an emergency. How do we expect to rescue 
each other in space if we cannot rescue each other from the sand?" 
</P>
<P>
Roars of laughter, as the stranded veterans of space flight surrendered to the 
sand and walked the remaining distance to the camp. 
</P>
<P>
There were other episodes such as that, when mirth and backslapping 
collegiality characterized the bond shared by the 19 American and 20 Soviet 
space fliers (as well as 11 mission specialists and a number of spouses) who 
came together here. 
</P>
<P>
But there was more to this meeting of superpower space heroes that was uniquely 
illustrative of the changes now sweeping this world. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the rigorously anti-communist Saudi kingdom had 
allowed any such visits by Soviets since diplomatic relations were severed in 
1930. The spectacle of Soviet and American space fliers dressed in long 
traditional Saudi thobes, sitting cross-legged on carpets in a Saudi Bedouin 
tent far into the desert and plunging both hands into an abundant Arab repast 
with their Saudi hosts, was the ultimate tribute to change. 
</P>
<P>
And these men whose political leaders have for nearly four decades sought ways 
to create yet more nuclear destructive power unanimously adopted an appeal to 
the world imploring mankind to find ways of ending abuse to the fragile 
environment of what cosmonauts and astronauts lovingly call "The Home Planet." 
</P>
<P>
There was no East-West name-calling or finger-pointing, no talk of military 
arms or nuclear weapons. But anyone who mingled with these men during this 
historic and remarkable meeting could read into their private words and their 
public statements an unmistakable message: Those who've seen Mother Earth from 
space -- the 220 men and women in this elite group -- are horrified by abuses 
that have spread air and water pollution. They are disbelieving that man would 
fire nuclear missiles on this fragile planet. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the participants had seen Earth at its smallest from the farthest 
distance -- Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon in 1969 and Apollo 11 shipmate Mike 
Collins piloted the lunar-orbiting command module. 
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that space pilots who have left the planet more than once 
have seen the gradual erosion of air and water quality -- the appearance of 
ominous oil slicks and drifting air pollution that respect no national borders. 
</P>
<P>
"Opportunities of space," the communique read, "are meaningless if mankind 
ignores the opportunities for enriching life on Earth. (We have) seen from afar 
the dangers that can imperil our planet, and thus poison the quality of life 
that will be inherited by generations yet unborn." 
</P>
<P>
All of those who've seen Earth from afar return with an identical shared 
emotion -- that mankind lives on a small, delicate planet whose livability is 
in peril. 
</P>
<P>
Each of them has contributed some memorable quote to the history of manned 
flight into space. One that seems to capture the flavor of most came from Saudi 
Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, 33, who flew in 1985 on the U.S. 
shuttle Discovery, and was the conference host. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day or so (in space), we all pointed to our countries," Salman said. 
"The third or fourth day we were pointing to our continents. By the fifth day, 
we were aware of only one Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Were it possible, all future East-West summits or future negotiations between 
warring nations should be held in space, aboard a shuttle, where men who would 
threaten Earth's survival with unthinkable acts of war and despoliation could 
see the precious planet that space fliers have seen.
