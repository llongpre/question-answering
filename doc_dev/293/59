   Columbia's astronauts mopped up
water from a leaky dehumidifier today as they closed in on the
floating science laboratory they plan to pluck from space on Friday
with the shuttle's robot arm.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee executed
three engine-firing maneuvers today, putting Columbia on a
near-collision course with the satellite they have been chasing
since they were launched Tuesday onto a path 1,725 miles behind
their quarry.
   Once the astronauts move in on the 11-ton target, they will fly
in formation 35 feet away while mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar
reaches out with Columbia's 50-foot mechanical arm to snare the
30-foot satellite, which is as large as a small school bus.
   If all goes well, she will make the catch at 9:48 a.m. Friday.
   The shuttle this morning was reported to be within 300 miles of
the satellite, known as the Long Duration Exposure Facility.
   Brandenstein and mission specialist David Low interrupted their
flight plans for more than two hours today to cope with the leak of
about two gallons of water, shown on television as a slow bubbling
of water beads.
   They shut off the faulty dehumidifier, shifted to a backup, and
then went to work on the water with towels and a hand-held vacuum,
using a flashlight to dry cables and other surfaces. Loose water,
which forms beads and globules in weightlessness, can interfere
with electronics.
   Looking at all the equipment that had to be moved to get at the
water, Brandenstein remarked, ``It's kind of a mess right now. I'll
get the plumber of the year award, but not the housekeeper of the
year award.''
   Scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how
various systems and materials withstood the long stay in orbit,
information that will help in designing the space station and other
space vehicles.
   Atmospheric drag has been pulling the satellite closer to Earth.
If Columbia does not retrieve it, trackers estimate the satellite
will burn up in a plunge into Earth's atmosphere about March 9, its
experiments lost forever.
   The shuttle, which is in a slightly lower orbit, takes less time
to circle the globe and was catching up with the satellite at a
rate today of about 38 miles for each 91-minute orbit of the Earth.
   Controllers, meanwhile, reported the $85 million Navy
communications satellite launched by the astronauts Wednesday was
functioning well. An onboard motor late Wednesday boosted it on
another leg toward its permament working outpost 22,300 miles above
the Pacific Ocean.
   As the gap between the shuttle and the wayward laboratory
closed, hunter and hunted were traveling nearly 200 miles high at
more than 17,400 mph.
   ``We're glad you're doing so well; the whole world's
impressed,'' Mission Control told the astronauts as it wakened them
today with its version of ``Banana Boat Song.''
   The control center version substituted the name of astronaut Low
for the words ``Day-O,'' and it included such phrases as, ``Come
all you astronauts sleeping in the cabin, daylight comes and its
time to get up.''
   Mission Control explained the words were written by members of
the team that trained Low for a space walk in case of an emergency
on this flight. To pass the time during these training sessions, he
often hummed the song.
   Low, replying in a calypso beat, said, ``Good morning, Houston,
man. We be up.''
   While the commander and pilot tended to flying Columbia, the
three mission specialists, Dunbar, Low and Marsha Ivins, busied
themselves with experiments. They melted crystals, photographed the
Earth and took medical measurements of one another in tests to
determine how well the human body adapts to space weightlessness.
   Columbia's 10-day mission, the second-longest in the 33 shuttle
flights, is a stepping stone toward longer shuttle missions and to
months-long rips aboard space station Freedom starting in the
mid-1990s.
   After Dunbar grabs LDEF, she will hold it on the end of the
robot arm for nearly four hours while Ivins makes a detailed
photographic survey of all 57 experiments mounted on the exterior.
   The laboratory has been exposed to space for six years and there
is concern some of the experiments might deteriorate when
re-introduced to Earth's gravity after being eroded by atomic
oxygen and bombarded by interplanetary debris.
