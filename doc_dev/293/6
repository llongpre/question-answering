<LEADPARA>  Two space-walking astronauts rode carts along a rail in Atlantis' open cargo
bay today, testing techniques that will be needed to build a space station.;  
 It was the second day in open space for Jerry Ross and Jay Apt, who took an
emergency "walk" Sunday to fix a stuck antenna on a $617 million observatory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Very nice braking. This thing moves very, very easily," Ross said as he
zipped up and down the nearly 47 feet of track on a manually operated cart.
"This is the way to travel around the world.";    Said Apt, who joined Ross
aboard the cart to test its capacity: "Boy, this thing glides slick. It really
does.";    They were less impressed with a mechanical cart that they operated
by pumping a handle back and forth. They said the brakes were bad. An electric
cart also was being tested.;    Today's spacewalk into the open bay, which had
been on the agenda all along, was to be more leisurely than the unscheduled
one Sunday.;    The two crew members had to go into space when the 17-ton
Gamma Ray Observatory's antenna couldn't be extended by electronic signals
from the ground. They shook the antenna loose, then got an early start on
today's space-walking activities.;    Flight director Phil Engelauf said
today's space walk would go as planned for about six hours unless the
astronauts become tired and want to go back in early. Only those tests
performed Sunday were dropped from the schedule.;    "But they were pretty
pumped up after yesterday's walk. I expect they'll want to go for six hours,"
Engelauf said today. "It's the astronauts' call.";    A battery on a backup
spacesuit was installed today in Ross' outfit after his battery failed to
recharge properly during the night. There were no problems with Apt's suit.;  
 Ross and Apt went into the shuttle's cargo bay Sunday to extend the
observatory's antenna from its 16 1/2-foot boom, and within minutes Ross had
shaken it loose.;    "It's free, it's free! I can see it move, it's free!" he
shouted.;    "Far out; good work," said Apt.;    It was the first spacewalk by
Americans in more than five years.;    NASA was quick to point out that the
observatory could not have been fixed on the spot if it had been carried aloft
by an unmanned rocket.;    "You saw today the value of manned space flight,"
said NASA flight director Chuck Shaw. "We did a lot of work from the ground,
and we needed the folks on the scene to finish up the job.";    Because Ross
and Apt already were in the cargo bay, NASA decided to have them start early
on some of today's spacewalk tasks.;    They did small tests to measure how
much effort building a space station would take. In one test, Ross lifted Apt
up and down several times and from side to side, while the platform he stood
on measured the force applied.;    The astronauts also cavorted about, doing
cartwheels and head stands.;    "Talk about a view," Apt exulted during the 4
1/2-hour spacewalk.;    "Feel like you're walking on top of the world? Look
what's coming, Jay. Hawaii," Ross said.;    The space station, if approved by
Congress, will be assembled in space and require considerable hands-on efforts
by astronauts.;    Sunday's effort was the second unscheduled walk in NASA
history. Astronauts went outside Discovery in April 1985 to try to switch on
the electrical power to a communications satellite launched from the shuttle,
but they couldn't fix it. A crew trained to do the repairs went up four months
later and fixed it.;    Ross and Apt were ordered outside the cabin after six
efforts from the ground failed to extend the antenna. NASA said a locking pin
on the antenna had properly retracted, and only a shake was required to work
the antenna loose.  </TEXT>
