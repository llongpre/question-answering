   Atlantis' astronauts soared past the
halfway mark of their four-day space journey Saturday, continuing a
light schedule of experiments as the probe they deployed soared
beyond the moon toward Venus.
   The workload aboard Atlantis was limited because the Magellan
probe and its rocket booster, which together weighed 45,000 pounds,
did not allow for many experiments to be carried aboard.
   Flight director Ron Dittemore dismissed a suggestion that the
astronauts had been on a ``joy ride'' since releasing the Venus
craft. He said NASA rules require a minimum four-day shuttle flight
to give crew members time to recover from any motion sickness
before conducting the crucial maneuvers required to return to Earth.
   More than half the 143 astronauts on earlier shuttle missions
became ill adapting to weightless space. Usually the illness was
not serious and lasted a day or two. None of Atlantis' five crew
members appeared to have suffered.
   ``We did sleep well and we're ready to roll today,'' commander
David Walker said after Mission Control in Houston awakened the
astronauts Saturday with a medley of their school songs.
   The crew had to work around two malfunctions Saturday morning.
The dial that regulates flow from a water dispenser in the galley
wouldn't work, so the astronauts attached a hose that controls
another dispenser. One of the cameras on board jammed and was set
aside while trouble shooters on the ground pondered how to fix it.
   The crew then settled into a day of metals processing, medical
and Earth photography experiments. Conversation was light and
mostly technical as they methodically went about their work,
talking sparingly with controllers 184 miles below on Earth.
   At midday, the astronauts dropped the pressure in the cabin from
a normal 14.7 pounds per square inch to 10.2 psi in a test of new
helmet equipment that will be used on future space shuttle space
walks. The cabin has to be partially depressurized for an outside
excursion. Dittemore said the exercise went very well.
   Walker said he and pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialists
Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard were pleased to hear that
Magellan was still operating perfectly as it continued its 15-month
voyage to Venus.
   Early Saturday, the probe passed the 240,000-mile distance from
Earth at which the moon orbits, and late in the day it was more
than 350,000 miles out, streaking along at 6,700 mph. Venus was
still more than 158 million miles away.
   Magellan is to fire into orbit around Venus in August 1990 and
is to map up to 90 percent of its surface with a high resolution
radar system. The images, expected to be 10 times clearer than any
previously obtained, could tell much about the history of that
mysterious cloud-shrouded planet.
   Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
at 3:43 p.m. EDT Monday.
