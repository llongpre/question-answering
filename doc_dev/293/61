   A new NASA report concludes that the planned $37
billion space station will require nearly 75 percent more
maintenance than earlier predicted, a newspaper reported today.
   The conclusion prompted the space agency to set up a special
team to search for ways to reduce maintenance of the 500-foot-long
station, The New York Times said.
   The newspaper quoted NASA engineers it did not identify by name
as saying the station, intended as a centerpiece for study of the
solar system by spacewalking astronauts, must be redesigned.
   ``You can't do it as currently designed,'' one of the engineers
was quoted as saying. ``You have to build a different station.''
   He said political pressure was on to downplay the problem.
   ``There's a lot of pressure to make this problem not a
problem,'' he said.
   Neither the new maintenance estimate from an earlier team of
experts nor the result of the search for solutions has been made
public. Both may be released next week, the newspaper said.
   The space station would need more than 3,800 hours of
maintenance by astronauts each year, the newspaper said.
Preliminary findings in March by the earlier team said the station
would require about 2,200 hours of maintenance each year.
   The special team was put together in June at Johnson Space
Center in Houston to mount a crash search for design changes and
other possible solutions, but some on that team expressed doubt
Tuesday that significant progress can be made.
   ``The numbers suggest the station cannot be built,'' the Times
quoted a Johnson Space Center engineer as saying.
   The space agency hoped to begin building the station in the
mid-1990s. The station would have a life span of 30 years.
   Billie A. Deason, a Johnson Space Center spokeswoman, said NASA
will have no comment on either the new maintenance estimate or the
search for solutions until all findings are made public.
   NASA already is under fire for a serious defect in the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope, hobbled by a mirror defect, and
fuel leaks that have grounded the $25 billion space shuttle fleet.
   Possible solutions to the space station maintenance problem
include improvements to increase the lifetimes of parts, combining
several repair tasks at one time and having advanced robots make
repairs.
