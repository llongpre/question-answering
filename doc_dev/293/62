<LEADPARA>  A simpler, more modest plan for NASA's space station is taking shape after
budget cuts and the discovery of design flaws sent architects back to the
drawing board.;    The orbiting outpost, first proposed by President Reagan
seven years ago, is still largely a castle in the clouds, even though $3.9
billion has been spent on studies and prototype parts.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Until last year, the goal of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration was to build a 508-foot-long, 300-ton facility housing up to
eight astronauts.;    The edifice was to be lofted piecemeal by the space
shuttle in the mid to late 1990s and would have cost $37 billion, not
including operating expenses.;    That plan was faulted as being costly and
defective.;    NASA's own experts said the vast complex -- nearly the size of
the Capitol building in Washington -- would need up to 3,700 hours of
maintenance a year by astronauts, 28 times the original aim of 130 hours.;   
According to internal NASA documents, the station's size and cost are now to
be reduced, its astronaut crew cut in half and its construction and repair
made easier, among scores of other major and minor changes.;    Most
important, the envisioned design will break NASA's longstanding practice of
trying to make the space station all things to all people.;    Gone are plans
for experiments to study the stars and the Earth, once pursued by a dozen
science teams around the country.;    Gone too are dreams of making the
outpost a staging area for forays to the moon and Mars.;    What remains are
plans to study the long-term effects of space on astronauts and other living
things (essential to judging the biological feasibility of a Mars voyage) and
to see whether the environment of near weightlessness offers commercial
possibilities for such processes as growing near-perfect crystals and forging
exceptionally pure metals.;    The principal question is whether the
slimmed-down station, which has lost constituents but not critics, will
survive congressional review in a time of budget austerity.;    "I think it's
going to fly," said Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the space policy
institute at George Washington University and a station historian.;    "NASA
has finally gotten and responded to the idea of down-sizing our ambitions to
match our resources.";    A White House official, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said planning for the space station had reached the end of the
road after undergoing six major changes of direction in as many years.;   
"The program might not survive if this redesign doesn't fly," the official
said.;    The latest jolt in the station's course was ordered late last year
by Congress and a White House panel after a series of problems emerged,
including a charge by astronauts that the structure's design was fundamentally
flawed.;    Dr. William F. Fisher, an astronaut who led a team that found
impossibly ambitious maintenance requirements, recently quit NASA and warned
that the outpost might be canceled outright if its redesign were superficial.  </TEXT>
