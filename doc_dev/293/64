   Two cosmonauts will blast off Sept. 6
to reman the orbiting space station Mir after a four-month lapse
dictated by finances and technical delays, space officials announced
today.
   The new six-month mission by flight commander Alexander S.
Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A. Serebrov will include a ride
outside Mir in a new ``space motorcycle.''
   Serebrov, a veteran of two earlier space flights, and Viktorenko,
who flew once before, are to blast off the night of Sept. 6 aboard a
Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur space center in the republic of
Kazakhstan, officials said.
   Mir, the showcase of the Soviet space program, was launched in
February 1986. Though designed to be permanently manned, it was
vacated April 27 when three cosmonauts rocketed back to Earth.
   Officials have said it was vacated to save money and because two
new modules for the station were not ready.
   The Soviet space program has come under fire recently for heavy
spending at a time when the country is suffering a $192 billion
budget deficit and shortages of food and other basic consumer goods.
   A 20-ton module containing the space motorcycle, a new space
shower and a new hatch for space walks will be launched in October
and attached to Mir, Serebrov told a news conference in Star City,
the cosmonaut trainin center 25 miles east of Moscow.
   Alexander N. Balandin, a backup engineer for the September
flight, said the motorcycle is similar to a maneuvering unit used by
U.S. space shuttle astronauts. The Soviet unit can travel 495 feet
from Mir for up to three hours.
   Alexei A. Leonov, deputy director of Gagarin Cosmonaut Training
Center at Star City and a former spaceman, told reporters he had
worked with Soviet engineers to develop a space motorcycle in the
early 1970s, but the project deemed unnecessary and canceled.
   A second module with equipment to grow crystals in the
weightlessness of space is to be launched in February, Serebrov said.
   The 20-ton Mir already has one module attached to it and a space
observation laboratory.
   Balandin and cosmonaut Anatoly Y. Solovyov are to join Viktorenko
and Serebrov aboard Mir in early March, officials told reporters.
   Mir had been manned for a total of 880 days by four crews since
its launch. Cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov broke space
endurance records by staying a year before returning to Earth.
