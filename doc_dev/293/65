Seven US space veterans returned home to Cape Canaveral in triumph
yesterday, after completing all scheduled repairs to the crippled Hubble
Space Telescope.
'Thank you for the flawless flight,' mission control told them as the
shuttle Endeavour rolled to a stop. 'We look forward to using (Hubble) to
see further into our universe than ever before.'
The 11-day mission - which some commentators had called the greatest
challenge for the US space agency Nasa since the moon landings more than 20
years ago - was a very public success.
In the course of five televised space walks, the crew (average age 46)
completed all their scheduled tasks, surpassing Nasa officials' highest
hopes. They replaced or repaired 11 defective parts on Hubble, including
lenses to correct the telescope's short-sightedness.
Astronomers will not know whether the mission has restored Hubble's full
sight until Nasa has completed several weeks of tests.
The first images from the repaired telescope are expected in February.
Nasa was also keen to point out that the repair mission would bolster the
agency's credibility in arguing for at least Dollars 10bn from Congress to
build a permanent space station in orbit.
It showed how well astronauts can work in space, with miniature electronic
components and with bus-sized pieces of hardware such as Hubble itself.
