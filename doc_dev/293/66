   The nine astronauts who worked in
Skylab, the only manned American space station, gathered Wednesday
to celebrate its launch nearly 15 years ago and to urge a greater
commitment to space exploration.
   ``Space is our frontier, and beginning its exploration may be
our generation's greatest contribution to human history,'' said
Alan Bean, commander of the second of three Skylab crews.
   Gerald Carr, who headed the third mission, agreed, saying future
space probes ``should avoid the 10- to 12-day mindset and plan for
the long haul.''
   Bean, Carr and their seven colleagues joined dozens of engineers
and other members of the Skylab team in observing the historic
events following Skylab's launch aboard a Saturn V rocket on May
14, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The three Skylab missions, from May 1973 to February 1974,
resulted in significant information about bio-medicine, solar
physics, astrophysics, engineering and technology, materials
processing and other topics.
   But the Skylab team first had to overcome problems that
threatened to jeopardize the mission before the astronauts stepped
aboard.
   Ground crews noticed shortly after the launch that a meteorite
and heat shield had ripped off and struck solar panels that were
left improperly deployed.
   But ground crews managed to alter the lab's orbit and develop a
shield that the first crew members, Joseph P. Kerwin, Charles
``Pete'' Conrad Jr. and Paul Weitz, carried into space with them 11
days after the initial launch.
   The crew made a daring space walk to adjust the panels when they
arrived and salvaged the mission.
   Other Skylab crew members were Owen K. Garriott and Jack Lousma,
who flew on the second mission, and Edward Gibson and William R.
Pogue, on the third.
   Tuesday's conference, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and the University of Alabama at Huntsville as
well as local space and aeronautics groups, was held at the Wernher
von Braun Civic Center, named in honor of the former German rocket
scientist who helped develop the American space program after World
War II.
   The Skylab astronauts showed no reluctance to join a similar
mission again.
   ``Eight of us got together after dinner Tuesday night and
someone asked if we would volunteer to go to Mars,'' said Kerwin,
scientist pilot on the mission. ``Eight hands shot up as rapidly as
possible.''
   ``We would do it in a minute,'' said Carr, commander of the last
mission.
   Kerwin said the nation's space program reached its peak in 1967,
when it received 7 percent of the federal budget. He said it had
been shrinking since then, now getting a fraction of 1 percent of
the budget.
   ``I hope that's not permanent,'' he said.
   One thing that Skylab showed, Carr said, is that people can hold
up in space longer than was thought.
   The first crew stayed aboard 28 days, the second 59 days, and
the third 84 days.
   Carr, now an aerospace consultant in Huntsville, Ark., said
today's generation of space scientists should avoid ``reinventing
the wheel. They would be remiss if they don't take the lessons that
have already been learned and re-apply them and build on that
data.''
