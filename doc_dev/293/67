   Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin led
a parade Saturday through Johnson Space Center in the city whose
name was the first word ever spoken on the moon two decades ago.
   ``On July 20, 1969, men first stepped on the moon and made more
than footprints in history,'' Aldrin told space fans at a rally
beside what would have been Apollo 18, the giant Saturn 5 rocket
whose mission was scuttled by an expensive war in Vietnam.
   Aldrin, minus his fellow moon-walker of 20 years ago, Neil
Armstrong, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts who attended the
Saturday morning events commemorating the successful 1969 mission
and other past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded
program of space exploration.
   When men first landed on the moon July 20, 1969, Armstrong had
said: ``Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.''
   ``Since then, we've seen many triumphs and tragedies in our
quest in space,'' Aldrin said, stopping for applause from the large
crowds surrounding Rocket Park. ``And now, thanks to President
Bush, we continue to reach for the stars.''
   Bush, in his speech Thursday on the 20th anniversary of the
lunar landing, called for a continuing commitment to space
exploration.
   Several thousand people attended the parade and rally at Johnson
Space Center, where Aldrin and others thanked Houston and the
surrounding cities for their support of the space program.
   Crowds that lined streets for the space center's first public
parade waved American flags and cheered the astronauts who have
lived and worked in the Houston area, where the astronaut corps is
based.
   Hot air balloons lifted into the air and T-38 training jets flew
in formation over the festivities.
   Aldrin received a plaque with a footprint like the ones left on
the moon, and a child's handprint. It was enscribed, ``When we
touch the moon again.''
   ``Not unlike earthbound explorers and adventurers before us, we
search for yet-unknown treasures and try to unlock and understand
the mysteries of nature,'' Aldrin said. ``It is inherent in our
kind to strive for a better understanding of life and a richer
source of understanding.''
   Aldrin joined NASA's current chief astronaut, Capt. Dan
Brandenstein, in recognizing other astronauts and space program
contributors before and after the historic moon mission.
   On stage with Aldrin and Brandenstein were astronauts
representing missions Apollo 9 _ the first to reach lunar distance
_ through Apollo 17.
   ``The Apollo landing, as you're all well aware, was probably the
premier event in the last 20 years or better and we are proud to
have these men back with us today,'' Brandenstein said. ``However,
a program like the Apollo program takes a great deal of teamwork,
as do many of the other (NASA) programs.''
   Just as the Mercury and Gemini programs laid the groundwork for
Apollo and the trip to the moon, Apollo helped lay the base for the
shuttle era and the work on the space station, he said.
