The Soyuz TM-20 due to blast off just before midnight last night from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is the first mission to carry astronauts
from the European Space Agency alongside Russian cosmonauts.
The spacecraft, carrying one ESA astronaut and two Russians, is heading for
Russia's Mir space station - a permanently manned operational base orbiting
400km above the Earth.
The 30-day mission not only heralds a new era in international space
co-operation, it is also the longest space flight by a western European
astronaut.
'This mission is paving the way to the International Space Station (a
much-disputed project not yet under way) when European astronauts will live
and work in space alongside Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Russians,'
says Jean-Marie Luton, ESA's director general.
Research during the Euromir 94 mission will focus on the effects of
microgravity - the very low gravity environment of an orbiting spacecraft -
on the the human body, information that will be needed if permanent manned
orbiting facilities and interplanetary space flights are to take place.
Profound changes take place in the human body during space flights.
Astronauts' faces quickly become swollen because of the movement of body
fluids from lower parts of the body towards the head. Disorientation is
common. With longer exposure to microgravity, muscles tend to weaken without
gravitational forces to work against, and bones lose minerals. At least 50
per cent of astronauts suffer from space sickness.
It was once thought that osteoporosis (a disorder characterised by increased
fragility of the bones) was controlled by hormonal reactions, yet in space
it was found to be affected by disuse atrophy - the lack of mechanical
forces acting on the bone structure.
'Ultimately it is believed that once a mechanism has been understood, a
means to compensate for it can then be found,' says Heinz Oser, the senior
life scientist in the ESA microgravity programme.
The length of the Euromir 94 mission will allow many of the more subtle
changes in the human body to be monitored over a longer period of time,
increasing the validity of the results. Studies of the muscle system in
particular will benefit. Other investigations will focus on the
cardiovascular, neuro-sensory and skeletal systems. Sleep patterns,
radiation effects and the body's immune system will also being studied.
