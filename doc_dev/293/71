INTELSAT last night successfully propelled its Dollars 157m
telecommunications satellite into a temporary orbit, preparatory to moving
it into its operational orbit. The satellite is to be lowered into its final
orbit in time for it to start work this summer.
This followed its rescue by US astronauts during the first three-man space
walk. The mission to save the satellite has brought Nasa, the US space
agency, its most sensational success since its re-organisation that followed
the explosion of the shuttle Challenger in 1986.
It had taken three tries before the astronauts, travelling at 17,000 miles
an hour, were able to snatch the elusive satellite on Wednesday night. They
set aside the bulky 'capture bar' which had been unsuccessfully employed to
snare the the 4.5-tonne satellite, and caught it by hand.
Once it was brought into the shuttle bay, the astronauts attached a new
12-tonne rocket motor and prepared it.
The mission was performed at the behest of a consortium of 22 countries
which own and operate the global communications satellite system. Intelsat
paid Dollars 150m up front and unreturnable to Nasa because the satellite is
expected to reap more than Dollars 1bn in business.
So strong was its faith in Nasa - which has never failed on six previous
missions to repair or recapture errant satellites - that Intelsat failed to
insure the mission, which would have added about Dollars 43m to its costs.
The entire Shuttle flight is reckoned estimated to have cost about Dollars
1bn. Nasa officials have been extolling its worth.
