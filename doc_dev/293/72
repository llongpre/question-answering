   Twenty years after man walked on the
moon, those responsible for that ``one giant leap for mankind'' said
the space program needs another bold challenge to recapture
America's imagination.
   And with America's imagination, they said, will come the
financial support needed for a daring project, such as landing
astronauts on Mars.
   On Saturday, a soldout crowd of more than 4,000 people joined the
Apollo 11 crew _ Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael
Collins _ at the Alabama Space and Rocket Center for the first of
four celebrations around the country to commemorate the lunar
landing on July 20, 1969.
   Huntsville's celebration focuses on the role this northern
Alabama city and the Wernher von Braun rocket team at NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center played in developing the Saturn V
rocket to propel Apollo 11 on its journey to the moon.
   The celebration was like a high-tech rock concert without the
music. Lasers bounced off rockets exhibited throughout the center,
sound effects simulated the takeoff of the Saturn V rocket to the
moon, and actors portrayed Armstrong's and Aldrin's walk on the
rugged lunar landscape four days after blasting off from Kennedy
Space Center.
   It climaxed with the Apollo 11 crew rising from a cloud of smoke
20 feet into the air to the front of a giant movie screen showing
footage of their travels. The crew was surrounded by a cacophony of
fireworks and dozens of dancing laser beams.
   Aldrin, who spent much of his time in Huntsville autographing his
new book ``Men from Earth,'' describes the 20th anniversary as
``bittersweet.'' That's because he worries that America ``will sink
to second-rate status'' in space if it continues on its present
course.
   The 59-year-old former astronaut said Saturday he hoped the
anniversary would help America set well-defined space objectives
instead of having each space shuttle flight ``being an entity into
itself.''
   ``There is an excitement about the past but there is not an
awareness of where we want to go,'' he said in an interview.
   He envisions the United States working with the Soviet Union and
Japan on space research projects, with a goal of developing
spaceships that will take advantage of planetary movements to
slingshot between Mars and Earth on five-month cycles.
   Collins, 58, also called for greater direction in the space
program.
   ``One of these days, and I hope it's not too long, this country
is going to decide it wants to go to Mars,'' he told a gathering of
engineers who worked on the Apollo project.
   Armstrong, 58, told the same group, ``A machine is man-made and
hence imperfect. No one has ever made a perfect machine. Those of
you who made the Saturn V came about as close as history ever
recorded.''
   Jack Lee, director at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville
and a former member of the von Braun team, vividly remembers
President Kennedy's seemingly impossible challenge to land a man on
the moon by the end of the 1960s.
   No president has issued an equally bold challenge since then, but
he hopes President Bush will in a 20th anniversary speech Thursday.
   ``We must continue what Wernher von Braun and Apollo 11 started
many years ago, that is to reach out and touch another world,'' he
said. ``This time our launching pad is going to be the space
station.''
   Konrad Dannenberg, a German rocket scientist who came to America
with Von Braun after World War II and later supervised engineering
and testing of the Saturn rocket, said the moon landing ``was the
biggest step for mankind that has ever taken place. I hope this
(anniversary) is the first step toward an even bigger achievement.''
   Ed Buckbee, director of the Space and Rocket Center, a tourist
attraction focused on space achievements, and a former member of Von
Braun's staff, said he hopes ``President Bush gives us a goal. I've
heard everything from a moon colony to a man on Mars, with a space
plane in there.''
   Buckbee said he sees only one way for NASA to recapture America's
imagination and pocketbook.
   ``It's got to be a man on Mars landing,'' he said. ``I don't
think a space station is going to capture American imagination. It's
got to be something that puts man and machine against the hazards of
space.''
