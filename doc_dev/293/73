   Two Soviet cosmonauts stationed on the Mir
orbiting complex installed a docking device for a ``space
motorcycle'' and other scientific gear Friday during a three-hour
space walk, Tass said.
   The space walk by Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov
was their third in recent weeks. They plan two more before they
return to Earth in mid-February, ending a six-month mission.
   The official Soviet news agency said the cosmonauts assembled a
docking mechanism that will be used later when they install the
``space motorcycle,'' a device to help cosmonauts get around in
open space near the orbiting complex.
   Tass said they also installed a television camera that will be
used for geophysical research and made an inspection of the outside
of their spacecraft and checked their radio communications.
   The two cosmonauts spent three hours and two minutes in space,
the report said.
