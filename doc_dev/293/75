   The head of NASA's space flight program
acknowledged Monday that repair and maintenance problems exist in
the planned space station but said they can be fixed by design
changes long before the station is built.
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' said Bill Lenoir, the space
agency's associate administrator for space flight. ``It's one of
many things at this point in the design that is inherently fuzzy.''
   A report in Monday's New York Times said NASA discovered
belatedly that the station, planned for assembly beginning in 1995,
would require about 2,200 hours of maintenance each year by
astronauts working in the hazardous open space environment.
   Lenoir said a more realistic _ but still inflated _ estimate is
550 hours, which he also considers too much.
   ``At this point, admittedly, we don't understand in depth the
reliability of the subsystems and pieces of subsystems,'' he said
in an interview. ``So we've made some unrealistic assumptions like
`everything that can fail will fail' and it will fail once a year.
   ``Then we multiply it all together and say, `well, gee, that's
550 hours.' We know that's harsh and probably higher than realistic
and that's what we'll be spending between now and December working
on,'' Lenoir said. The figure is exaggerated even more, he said, by
being multiplied by four to 2,200 hours.
   The Times said NASA investigators discovered ``the setback''
early this year, but Lenoir said it has been an issue that's been
worked on for six months and part of a preliminary design process
that will continue until a review in December.
   ``We've taken this quick and dirty bottoms-up assessment and now
we are going to dig in item-by-item and say what's the real
requirement and how will we deal with it,'' Lenoir said.
   ``I wouldn't say I'm not worried about it, but I'm worried about
it no more than anything else. I'm paid to worry about everything.''
   The newspaper's report said there were 5,578 parts outside the
station's inhabited modules that could be replaced if they failed
and that those calculations increased the work load by 30 percent.
   Lenoir said maintenance and repair of any such items can be
planned in four ways:
   ``I can live with it, I can do it robotically, I can make it
require less (maintenance) by upping its reliability, or I can move
it inside (the pressurized living module) so it becomes an
intravehicular rather than an extravehicular job.''
   Lenoir said it would be wrong to think the space station has a
major problem ``when in fact we have a minor problem, business as
usual, we are working on it and we are on schedule for coping with
it.''
