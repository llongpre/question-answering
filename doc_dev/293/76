   Two cosmonauts will reactivate the Mir
space station in September after four months in mothballs, and
they'll try out a new ``space motorcycle'' and shower, and install a
docking port for the Soviet space shuttle, officials said Tuesday.
   Alexander S. Viktorenko, the flight commander, and Alexander A.
Serebrov, the flight engineer, are to blast off Sept. 6 to resume
the Soviet manned space program that was put on hold because of
tight finances and technical delays.
   Among the highlights of the six-month mission will be a ride
outside Mir in a ``space motorcycle.'' Alexander N. Balandin, a
backup engineer for the flight, said the motorcycle is similar to
the manned maneuvering unit used by U.S. space shuttle astronauts.
   It can travel up to 50 yards away from Mir for 2-3 hours at a
time, he told a news conference at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training
Center in Star City, about 25 miles east of Moscow.
   Soviet officials have said cosmonauts will use the craft to
inspect Mir's exterior, repair satellites and as a rescue vehicle.
   Mir, the showcase of the Soviet space program launched in
February 1986, was designed to be manned permanently but was
unexpectedly vacated April 27, when three cosmonauts returned to
Earth.
   Officials have said the Mir was mothballed to save money and
because two new modules _ including one containing the motorcycle _
were not ready.
   The Soviet space program has come under fire for lavish spending
at a time when the country is suffering a $192 billion budget
deficit and chronic shortages of consumer goods and food. Serebrov
said the lapse in the program saved an estimated $32 million,
including the cost of a supply ship that would have been needed as
well as a crew transport capsule and rocket booster.
   ``Unfortunately, the calculations are such now that when a
cosmonaut doesn't fly, we economize and it's advantageous. We're
working toward a situation where a cosmonaut flies and there will be
only profit,'' said Anatoly Y. Solovyev, another backup cosmonaut
for the mission.
   A 20-ton module containing the cycle, a new space shower and
wider, more comfortable airlock for space walks will be launched in
October and attached to Mir, Serebrov said. The cosmonauts plan to
try out the new cycle at some point during the mission while wearing
a new, more flexible spacesuit.
   Alexei A. Leonov, the training center's deputy director and a
former cosmonaut, said he had worked with Soviet engineers to
develop a space motorcycle in the early 1970s but the project was
canceled ``because some wise guy said it wasn't needed.''
   A second module with a special docking port to receive the new
Soviet shuttle Buran and equipment to grow crystals for electronics
in the weightlessness of space is to be launched in February,
Serebrov said.
   Buran, a carbon copy of the U.S. shuttle, flew for the first time
in November without a crew. Leonov said the shuttle won't fly again
until 1991 at the earliest, and then will be launched without a crew
to link up with Mir using the new docking port. It could return to
Earth carrying cosmonauts, Leonov said.
   The 20-ton Mir already has one module attached to it, a space
observation laboratory called Kvant. Mir has docking ports for three
more modules.
   Serebrov, a veteran of two flights, and Viktorenko, who flew once
before, are to blast off at night aboard a Soyuz rocket from the
Baikonur space center in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan,
Leonov said.
   Balandin and Solovyov are to join the two aboard Mir in early
March and work with them for a week, said Viktorenko, 43. He said he
and Serebrov, 45, will then return to Earth.
   Mir has been manned for 880 days since its launch, with four
resident crews. Cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov broke
space endurance records by staying aboard for one year.
