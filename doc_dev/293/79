<LEADPARA>  Grunting, puffing and giggling as they glided up and down the shuttle's cargo
bay, two astronauts tested several different vehicles Monday to determine
which would be the most helpful to workers who are to assemble the space
station later this decade.;    What they may have proved during their marathon
venture outside the Atlantis is that less may be best.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Astronauts Jerry L. Ross, 43, and Jay Apt, 41, seemed to prefer the
simplest of the three vehicles they tested along a 47-foot-long track they
installed on the side of the cargo bay.;    NASA wants to know; The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration would like to know which vehicle would
best serve astronauts who would be required to make many trips along the
station's main truss, which will be longer than a football field. Sometimes
they will have to carry loads so heavy they could not budge them on the
ground.;    One day after their unscheduled spacewalk, during which they fixed
a stuck antenna that threatened the $617 million Gamma Ray Observatory,
Monday's "extra-vehicular activity," as NASA calls it, was sort of a joy
ride.;    Hand over hand over Cuba;  "What a great way to travel," Ross said
as he glided along the rail. The Atlantis was passing 280 miles above Cuba,
traveling at 17,300 miles an hour, as the two astronauts moved back and forth
on their makeshift railroad at about the speed of a brisk walk.;    One of the
three vehicles was a platform that the astronaut hooked his feet in and then
pulled himself manually -- hand over hand -- along the rail. The second looked
a little like a railway push car; the astronaut powered it by pushing a handle
back and forth, cranking a mechanical ratchet drive. The third was powered by
a motor with electricity generated by cranks turned by the astronaut.;    Both
men seemed to prefer the hand-over-hand, manually propelled platform, and
their conclusions largely will determine what system is eventually used, said
former astronaut Robert Overmyer, who is in charge of astronaut systems for
one of the station's prime contractors, McDonnell Douglas.;    The Atlantis,
commanded by Steven R. Nagel, 44, is scheduled to land Wednesday at 7:34 a.m.
PDT at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California. The other crew members
are Kenneth D. Cameron, 41, the pilot, and Linda M. Godwin, 38.  </TEXT>
