   NASA said today that its engineers have
worried for years that astronauts will have to spend too much time
in the harsh environment of open space to repair and maintain the
space station that is set for construction in the mid-90s.
   Agency officials were preparing a response to a front-page
article in the New York Times today that said the station can't be
built as designed ``because its vast array of parts would start to
break down before the station was completed.''
   The first elements of the $30 billion station are to be carried
into orbit beginning early in 1995 and completion is scheduled for
1999. The Times said NASA investigators found that construction
would be only 60 percent to 70 percent complete before preventive
maintenance would have to begin.
   The Times said investigators concluded that, if built according
to plan, the space station would have more than 5,500 external
parts that would need to be replaced if they failed. That would
require space walks, or what NASA calls EVAs, short for
extra-vehicular activity.
   ``In terms of the program addressing EVAs, that is not a new
thing; it's not a new problem that has suddenly been discovered,''
said space station spokesman Mark Hess.
   The Times said such space walks would total 2,200 hours for
maintenance, but Hess said that estimate includes a lot of time in
which astronauts would not actually be outside of the relative
safety of the station.
   Anther spokesman, James McCulla, said EVA time ``is a matter
that space station designers have been working on for years.''
   He said that working out methods to cut down the EVA time is an
integral part of design review activities ``and therefore will be
an important matter to be worked on for days to come.''
