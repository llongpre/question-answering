   NASA's failure to fix Atlantis'
hydrogen leak bumped another shuttle flight into 1991. A team of
NASA experts, meanwhile, began looking into the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope's woes.
   But the space agency also got a bit of good news Wednesday: A
thrice-delayed launch of an unmanned Atlas rocket went off without
a flaw.
   ``It's good to have something positive happen,'' NASA spokesman
Jim Cast said. ``It's a definite boost to NASA morale.''
   After three postponements due to mechanical problems and bad
weather, the rocket blasted into space with a NASA and Air Force
satellite that will study electric and radiation fields far above
Earth.
   Earlier in the day, a last-ditch effort to fix Atlantis at the
launch pad failed. Atlantis became the second shuttle in two months
to be sent back to the hangar for repair of a hydrogen leak.
   The leak reappeared when liquid hydrogen was pumped into
Atlantis' external tank. It was the third such test of Atlantis,
but the agency still was unable to pinpoint the leak.
   NASA postponed the shuttle's secret Pentagon flight from this
month to November.
   Columbia, the first leaky shuttle rolled back from the launch
pad, now will be next to fly. Its astronomy mission, originally
scheduled for May, is set for September.
   ``We have every reason to believe that we have no more problems
ahead of us on Columbia,'' said William Lenoir, head of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space flight
program.
   The space agency has replaced Columbia's leaky plumbing. Its
leak was believed to be larger than the one plaguing Atlantis and
in a different place.
   Atlantis' delay means NASA must bump another flight into 1991. A
second Atlantis mission set for this year, with the Gamma Ray
Observatory, originally was scheduled for November and now probably
will be early next year.
   Nine shuttle flights had been planned for 1990. The number is
down to seven now.
   The shuttle developments came as a space agency team began
investigating the cause of NASA's highest-profile problem: the
flawed mirror on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope that is
sending back blurry images.
   The seven-member team, led by Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, took testimony in secret Wednesday at the
plant where the mirror was made, Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems
Inc. of Danbury, Conn.
   Allen said the group hoped to find a ``smoking gun and a
fingerprint on the trigger.''
   The flaw has halved the effectiveness of Hubble, placed in orbit
in April by astronauts aboard Discovery, the last shuttle to fly. A
repair mission by space-walking astronauts is planned for 1993.
   The Hartford Courant reported Wednesday that scientists may have
discovered the flaw in May 1981 but dismissed the evidence because
they believed it was the result of a faulty testing apparatus.
   On the shuttle front, NASA officials had hoped Atlantis' problem
could be solved by tightening bolts around the suspected leak area,
a flange in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to
the main engines.
   The leak was discovered in a fueling test June 29, after which
NASA temporarily grounded the three-shuttle fleet.
   NASA wants to get at least one shuttle up before Discovery's
October mission with Ulysses, a satellite that will explore the
sun's poles.
