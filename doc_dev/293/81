   The space shuttle Columbia gained
on its quarry Thursday in its orbital pursuit of an 11-ton
satellite that the astronauts hope to capture and save from burning
up in the atmosphere.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee fired the
shuttle's orbital engines three times Thursday to put the shuttle
on a near-collision course with the satellite they have been
catching up with since liftoff Tuesday.
   As the astronauts ended their workday Thursday afternoon,
Columbia was 218 miles from its target and closing at a speed of
about 24 miles per 91-minute orbit.
   ``Tomorrow's a big day, so get a good night's sleep tonight,''
said Jim Voss, the shuttle communicator at Mission Control.
   ``We had an excellent day and we're looking forward to
tomorrow,'' replied mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar.
   When the shuttle was launched, it entered orbit 1,725 miles
behind its quarry, but it has flown in a lower orbit than LDEF so
it could circle the Earth faster and catch up with the satellite.
   Eight more maneuvers were planned for early Friday before
Brandenstein would assume manual control of the shuttle for the
final approach to the Long Duration Exposure Facility, which is the
size of a small school bus.
   ``The orbiter continues to perform very well, orbiter and
crew,'' flight director Bill Reeves said during a press briefing
late Thursday afternoon. ``Everything is go for the rendezvous
tomorrow.''
   Flight director Al Pennington said Thursday that when the
shuttle is about 400 feet away from LDEF, the crew ``will get a
good look at the sides of it. At that point in time, he
(Brandestein) will have a good visual image of what he's going in
for.''
   Once within range of the target, the plan was for the shuttle to
fly in formation 35 feet from LDEF while Dunbar uses the orbiter's
50-foot robot arm to reach out and grab the satellite, expected at
9:48 a.m. EST Friday.
   After snaring the satellite, she will turn the arm slowly for
four hours so LDEF can be photographed before it is tucked into the
shuttle's cargo bay for the trip home. Mission specialist Marsha
Ivins was in charge of the photography.
   The satellite has been in orbit for nearly six years, but it is
being slowed by atmospheric drag and tugged down by Earth's
gravity. If the astronauts don't retrieve it, it is expected to
plunge to Earth on March 9 and burn up in the atmosphere.
   Scientists hope LDEF is returned intact so they can see what has
happened to its experiments after the long exposure to space.
   Early Thursday, Brandenstein and mission specialist David Low
interrupted their flight plans for about three hours to mop up
about two gallons of water that leaked from a faulty dehumidifier.
The spill was shown on television as a slow bubbling of water beads
floating in the air.
   When Brandenstein looked at all the equipment that had to be
moved to get at the water, he remarked: ``It's kind of a mess right
now. I'll get the plumber of the year award, but not the
housekeeper of the year award.''
   Mission Control awakened the five astronauts Thursday with its
own version of the ``Banana Boat Song.''
   The name of astronaut Low was substituted for the words
``Day-O,'' and it included such phrases as, ``Come all you
astronauts sleeping in the cabin, daylight comes and its time to
get up.''
   Mission Control said the words were written by members of the
team that trained Low for a space walk in case of an emergency on
this flight. To pass the time during these training sessions, he
often hummed the melody.
   ``Good morning, Houston, man. We be up,'' Low replied in a
calypso beat.
   In addition, controllers reported Thursday that the $85 million
Navy communications satellite launched by the astronauts Wednesday
was functioning well.
   Columbia's 10-day mission is the second-longest in the 33
shuttle flights, is a stepping stone toward longer shuttle missions
and to months-long trips aboard space station Freedom starting in
the mid-1990s.
