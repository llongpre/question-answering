   Two of the five military men who
will conduct space shuttle Atlantis' secret mission are rookie
astronauts _ a sign of NASA's renewed confidence after Discovery's
triumphant flight earlier this fall.
   And because the flight is entirely classified, the astronauts
will see virtually none of the fanfare that greeted the first
post-Challenger crew. Few details about the mission are being made
public, the astronauts are restricted from talking about their
plans, and even the exact launch time will not be released until
nine minutes prior to liftoff on Dec. 1.
   Recently, the Atlantis astronauts showed up for interviews with
several reporters at the Johnson Space Center wearing ``Lone
Ranger'' style masks as a tongue-in-cheek way of highlighting the
secrecy.
   Astronauts on classified missions generally are off-limits to the
media altogether, but the military agreed to let the Atlantis crew
talk to a few reporters because there was so much interest
surrounding the flight.
   The astronauts said the black masks came in a ``press kit'' that
included flash cards with joke answers that read: ``Yes. No. I don't
know. I can't tell you. I can tell you, but I'd have to kill you.''
   The mixture of veteran and rookie astronauts on the Atlantis crew
returns NASA to the policy it generally followed before the
Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986. For Discovery, with the future
of the nation's space effort hanging in the balance, NASA chose to
go with five experienced astronauts.
   The Atlantis commander is Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson, who piloted
a flight in 1984 and headed the crew of the last mission to fly
before Challenger.
   Gibson, who is married to an astronaut, Dr. Rhea Seddon, said he
doesn't expect any major problems flying the orbiter, which has
undergone many changes since the Challenger tragedy.
   ``Discovery did an awful lot of trailblazing and the pathfinding
for all these new modifications we've got to do, and so they went
through all of those and we've had a relatively easy time modifying
Atlantis,'' the 42-year-old Gibson said.
   Still, Gibson is too experienced to expect perfection.
   ``There's always going to be little annoyances, litle glitches
that you're going to encounter,'' he said.
   The other crew members include rookies Guy S. Gardner, an Air
Force lieutenant colonel who has waited seven years to fly in space,
and William M. Shepherd, a Navy commander. Gardner, 40, is the pilot
and Shepherd, 39, is one of three mission specialists.
   Rounding out the crew are Air Force Col. Richard ``Mike''
Mullane, 43, and Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross, 40, who each have
made one shuttle flight.
   Mullane was a mission specialist on the maiden flight of
Discovery in 1984, and Ross twice walked in space during his 1985
flight on Atlantis while demonstrating construction techniques for a
space station.
   Shepherd, who was selected as an astronaut in May 1984, said that
after years of hearing other people talk about spaceflight, he'll be
glad to experience it himself.
   ``I get the impression that it's something that's real hard to
describe, it's pretty enjoyable, pretty awesome and you just have to
see it for yourself before you really understand it,'' he said.
``Most of the contact that I've had with members of the crew and
(astronauts) in our office say things like that.''
   Shepherd, who is single, said his mother and his sister and her
family are planning to be at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to watch his
first launch.
   Gibson, who has a 12-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, said
his family has gotten more comfortable with his job, but still gets
anxious. His mother, who is a pilot, was so nervous at his first
launch that she looked the other way during liftoff.
   ``Even though she was an aviator all those years, it still
bothered her enough that she didn't want to watch. I think after a
couple of minutes, as we got higher off the ground, I think she
started to watch then,'' he said.
   His son, Paul, thinks ``everybody's parents'' fly on shuttles.
   ``He's not old enough to realize that not everybody's folks do
this. So he thinks when he's big, he'll fly space shuttles and he'll
take us to watch his space shuttles go.''
   All shuttle crew members are allowed to take personal mementos
and cassettes of music into space. Shepherd said he is taking
several items on his first flight, but he doesn't want to say what
they are because it's a surprise for his family.
   Astronauts often take such things as pictures, jewelry,
medallions and flags aboard for their relatives, former schools and
favorite organizations.
   Mullane, who was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, but considers
Albuquerque, N.M., his hometown, is taking along a dinosaur tooth.
   The tooth, part of the collection at the New Mexico Museum of
Natural History in Albuquerque, is from a meat-eating dinosaur
common to the New Mexico area about 68 million years ago, said John
Arnold, museum spokesman.
   Arnold said Mullane is a fan of the museum and had asked
officials there if they wanted him to take an artifact into space.
They happily provided the tooth, which will be returned after its
trip.
   Gardner, a native of Alexandria, Va., will carry a key to the
city and an athletic letter from George Washington High School.
   Ross was born in Crown Point, Ind., where his parents still live.
Shepherd was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and grew up in the
Washington, D.C. area, where his mother still lives.
   Gibson is taking along a baseball from the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, N.Y., where he was born. Once in space, all the
astronauts will sign the ball and it later will be returned to the
hall, he said.
   ``We've got a bunch of guys in the office who are real baseball
fans and they are just sick that I'm going to have my name in the
Baseball Hall of Fame,'' he said.
