   For the second time in the brief
history of manned space flight, the United States is poised to
rebound from tragedy.
   The explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, bore
some striking similarities to another disaster almost exactly 19
years earlier _ the Apollo 1 fire of Jan. 27, 1967.
   In both cases, poor design, inadequate management, safety lapses
and communications breakdowns were at fault. Recovery required
months of remorse, realignment and repair.
   Failure to recover from Apollo 1 would have derailed America's
goal of a manned lunar landing before the end of the decade.
Another Challenger-type accident could deal a death blow to the
nation's space program.
   But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration bounced
back brilliantly from the 1967 fire and sent astronauts to the
moon. And now the agency says it has done everything it can to make
the shuttle a safe ship, and the first flight since Challenger is
set for liftoff Thursday.
   NASA is counting on success to revive its fortunes and provide a
springboard to a future that will include a permanent manned space
station and eventually flights to Mars and other parts of the solar
system.
   There is also the matter of national pride. Before Challenger,
the United States held undisputed world leadership in space
exploration. But since the accident, the Soviets have overtaken the
Americans in many categories, including manned spaceflight
experience, and they have a stated goal to dispatch men to Mars
early in the 21st century.
   In 1967, the United States also had its eye on the Soviet Union.
America had been stung by early Russian space successes and the two
superpowers were in a race to see which could first land men on the
moon as a symbol of technological prowess.
   Against that backdrop, the three Apollo 1 astronauts, Gus
Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, entered their capsule atop a
Saturn 1B rocket on that day late in January for a launch pad
countdown test. They were scheduled for launch into Earth orbit in
February on the first flight test of the Apollo spacecraft that was
to transport astronauts to the moon.
   Five hours later all three were dead, killed by a fire that
swept through the spacecraft.
   An investigation board could not pinpoint definitely the cause
of the fire, but listed the most likely source as an electric arc
in defective wiring under Grissom's seat.
   The report criticized NASA and North American Aviation, the
capsule builder, for poor management, carelessness, negligence,
sloppy work and failure to adequately consider the safety of the
astronauts.
   Top management at both were overhauled, and a $75 million
program was launched to redesign the spacecraft.
   Twenty-one months after the accident, on Oct. 11, 1968, the
effort paid off when three astronauts rode a redesigned capsule
into orbit and thoroughly checked it out during an 11-day flight.
The mission was so successful that NASA scheduled the next flight
as an orbital trip around the moon on Christmas Eve.
   Two more preliminary flights followed, and on July 20, 1969,
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon,
beating President John F. Kennedy's end-of-the-decade deadline by
five months.
   Six more moon missions followed, but three others were canceled.
   The United States had won the race to the moon, leaving the
Soviets far behind. But ironically, with the end of this era came a
long, troubled period for NASA.
   The agency should not have been surprised. From a peak budget of
$6 billion in 1965, at the height of Apollo development, NASA's
fortunes had been declining every year. Several next-generation
proposals had been rejected or scaled down.
   NASA had counted on the tide of Apollo 11 enthusiasm to rescue
its bold plans for the future. But the agency misread the mood of a
nation torn by Vietnam and by racial unrest. Much of the press and
some politicians came to view the space effort as a symbol of
misplaced national priorities. With detente, the Soviet threat no
longer seemed so ominous.
   Congress and the Nixon administration told the agency to scrap
its plans for large space stations, a moon base and manned trips to
Mars. NASA budgets fell below $4 billion, its personnel from a peak
of 36,000 to 21,000.
   The only major project to survive was the reusable space
shuttle, but it was years away.
   In the interim, NASA used leftover Apollo rockets and spacecraft
to build Skylab, a modest space station which in 1973 and 1974
served as orbital home to three crews for periods up to 84 days.
Another leftover Apollo capsule carried three American astronauts
to a linkup with two Soviet cosmonauts in 1975.
   Following that flight, the American manned space program entered
a dry spell of six years.
   NASA had hoped to launch the first shuttle in 1978, but there
were funding difficulties and serious design and development
problems.
   The shortage of money forced engineers to abandon plans for a
fully reusable shuttle employing only liquid fuel engines. Instead
they settled on two solid fuel rockets to assist the craft into
orbit _ a decision that would come back to haunt them the day
Challenger blew up.
   Columbia, the first shuttle, made it into orbit in April 1981,
starting a string of 24 successful flights. The program boasted
some remarkable achievements, from flying the first American women
and black astronauts, to deploying satellites, retrieving and
repairing others and conducting pioneering experiments in a cargo
bay unit known as Spacelab.
   Spaceflight seemingly had become routine and NASA became so
confident of its machine that it added congressmen, a Saudi prince
and non-astronaut researchers and scientists to the crews.
   A schoolteacher, Christa McAuliffe, was in the crew of seven
when the string ended with that awful explosion of Challenger 73
seconds after liftoff on a cold January day in 1986.
   When the Rogers commission that investigated the accident
released its report, it sounded as though the space agency had
forgotten the lessons of Apollo 1.
   The report said the direct cause of the explosion was a leak at
a joint between two segments of one of Challenger's two solid fuel
booster rockets. Flames shot past two synthetic rubber O-rings and
ignited the external fuel tank.
   The commission said cold weather, 36 degrees at launch time,
contributed to the accident by robbing the rings of their
resiliency, preventing them from sealing the joint properly. Some
engineers had argued with lower-level managers against launching in
the cold, but their concerns never were communicated to those
making the launch decision.
   The report scored NASA for lapses in judgment, safety, design,
communications and management. There were wholesale shakeups of
management at the space agency and the booster rocket maker, Morton
Thiokol, and a $1.2 billion redesign program was undertaken.
   A total of 56 major and 400 lesser changes have been made to
Discovery. NASA says it now is ready to put them and its future to
the test.
