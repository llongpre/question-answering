   Astronauts and cosmonauts began a
five-day conference Saturday focusing on the peaceful use of space
technology.
   Russel Schweickart, an Apollo 9 astronaut and co-chairman of the
Association of Space Explorers, said one item high on the agenda is
a proposed ``Rescue in Space'' program that would include laws and
facilities to aid spaceships in distress.
   ``Space for Earth'' is the theme of the group's fifth Planetary
Congress and is the title of an address to be delivered by India's
Dr. Yash Pal, this year's winner of the association's award for his
work in designing a satellite network to serve rural areas.
   Schweickart and Soviet Maj. Gen. Alexei Leonov, co-chairmen of
the association, expressed hope their governments will eventually
agree to send a joint team to Mars. Schweickart, an Apollo 9
astronaut, said the association has submitted a recommendation to
the U.S. Congress to accept the principle of such a voyage.
   ``It's much easier and far less costly for us ... to fly
together to Mars,'' Leonov told a news conference. ``We fervently
hope we will do it jointly.''
   Leonov, the first man to walk in space, also underscored the
importance of biomedical studies in space and experimenting with
plant cultivation on Mars.
   Saudi astronaut Prince Sultan bin Salman, the first Arab to
visit outer space, appealed to reporters to exhort peoples and
governments of the world to support the Association.
   A major in the Saudi Air Force, the young prince, the host of
the conference, was aboard a U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery flight in
1985.
   The astronauts listened to reporters' questions about space
being infested with spy satellites and threatened by tension
between the superpowers.
   Schweickart said the congress can only recommend means of
employing space technology for the good of mankind, and Leonov
stressed that ``we (congress members) are against wars of all
kinds, be them on Earth or in space. War is the ugliest affliction
to which mankind can be subjected.''
   Soviet cosmonauts, apparently aware of being hosted by the
guardians of the Islamic faith, guardedly shirked atheism and
conceded that God exists. Leonov lauded Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev for ``reinstating religion to its rightful place in (the
Soviet) society.''
   ``Indeed, this is one of Gorbachev's wisest decisions,'' he
said. ``We know that Karl Marx had said that religion is the opium
of peoples ... what a blissful opium.''
   The Saudis have mobilized a fleet of military jets to fly the
guest spacemen to deliver lectures at universities, military
academies and technical institutes along the vast kingdom on
Tuesday.
