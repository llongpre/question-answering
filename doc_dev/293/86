   An intelligence-gathering satellite
capable of spying on 80 percent of the Soviet Union will be carried
by the secret space shuttle mission scheduled for late this month,
an industry magazine reports.
   ``When fully deployed, the spacecraft will have a span as large
as 150 feet,'' Aviation Week and Space Technology reported. ``It has
the characteristics of an imaging radar or optical reconnaissance
involving digital imaging, or both.
   ``The radar transmission is designed to penetrate cloud cover and
would be valuable in both ocean and land surveillance,'' the
magazine said in its Nov. 7 issue, available Friday.
   Space shuttle Atlantis and its five-man crew will be flying the
third classified Defense Department shuttle mission, and the
Pentagon and NASA have cloaked most details about it in secrecy.
NASA processing director Conrad Nagel said the agency was aiming for
launch on Nov. 28 or 29.
   Aviation Week said the satellite will be launched into an orbit
that will enable it to look down on 80 percent of the Soviet Union.
At least three of the 27 earlier shuttle missions flew over the same
Soviet territory.
   The magazine said the satellite will be dropped overboard from
the cargo bay by an astronaut using the craft's 50-foot robot arm.
Two astronauts are prepared to take a space walk in case there is
trouble deploying the satellite.
   Aviation Week said estimates of the cost of the satellite, filled
with advanced-technology equipment, range as high as $500 million.
It said the satellite could be retrieved on a later shuttle mission
and returned to Earth for improvements.
   Sources who insisted on anonymity earlier told The Associated
Press that Atlantis would carry an intelligence-gathering satellite
that would help U.S. intelligence officials verify that the Soviets
were complying with arms control treaties.
   The sources also said the astronauts will conduct several
experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military observer in
space. The tests would involve coordination with troop and ship
movements and missile launchings on Earth.
   The space shuttle program resumed Sept. 29 with the successful
launch of Discovery, the first shuttle launched since the fatal
explosion of the shuttle Challenger in January 1986.
   During the hiatus, the Pentagon relied on conventional rockets to
send military payloads into space.
