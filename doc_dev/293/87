   Before the first shuttle flight in 1981, in
the white-knuckle days when space engineers still wondered if the
engines would fire and the heat shield would hold up for re-entry,
NASA had a launch schedule that seemed either very optimistic or
just plain crazy: 48 flights in five years.
   As recently as 1985, the agency was scheduling 24 flights in
1989 alone.
   Over the years, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration had given a proud name to its philosophy for such
ambitious planning: ``Success oriented.'' A skeptic would ask, how
can you expect to launch 24 missions in one year, and a NASA
official would respond, ``It's a success-oriented schedule, but
that's our goal.''
   Now, for the first post-Challenger launch, success-oriented has
given way to ``safety first.''
   Success-oriented is a system in which NASA sets a work schedule
that allows no coasting and presumes no delays. It's a sort of
Anti-Murphy's Law: If anything can go right, it will go right, and
at just the right time. In life-or-death circumstances, it is a
calculated method for achieving intensity, and maximum results,
from the limited tax resources available for spaceflight.
   Aim for 48, come as close as you can. (NASA flew 21 flights in
those first five years.)
   Before long, the real Murphy's Law often took over. The 24th
mission, with celebrity astronaut Rep. Bill Nelson on board, was
rescheduled a record seven times before the congressman and crew
finally was launched into space on Jan. 12, 1986. Landing was
delayed three times and then rerouted from Florida to California.
   The next flight went to Challenger, and its tragic end on Jan.
28, 1986, forced NASA to rethink and abandon the success-oriented
work routine.
   Instead, the agency moved slowly, cautiously and as quietly as
possible in preparing Discovery for its mission to end NASA's
32-month absence from spaceflight.
   NASA waited until this past Saturday to set its final launch
date: Thursday, Sept. 29, 9:59 a.m. EDT. At one point, the agency
was so intent on NOT setting a launch date that it cited a
hurricane off Texas _ not Florida _ to delay its announcement
another 48 hours.
   Success-oriented? Not this time.
   Yet, over the years, the NASA doctrine had its good days.
   Success oriented put Neil Armstrong on the moon.
   It is difficult today to recall how outlandish it seemed in 1961
when President Kennedy called on NASA to harness the ``dedication,
organization and discipline'' to put man on the moon by 1970.
America's space program was in its bumbling infancy. The Soviets
had humiliated the United States with Sputnik and then with Yuri
Gagarin. Alan Shepard had made a suborbital flight, but no American
had even orbited the Earth, let alone achieved any of the other
requirements (rendezvous, space walks, powerful new rocket engines,
lunar landing vehicles) that would allow NASA to realize Kennedy's
goal, ``before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to the Earth.''
   NASA completed its Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs with a
success-oriented work regime that provided the United States some
of its proudest moments. The approach worked so well that even
after the Apollo 1 launch pad fire, while mourning three
astronauts, NASA quickly fixed the problem and the program moved
forward. A 32-month delay? It was beyond comprehension.
   By 1986, though, success-oriented may have been more of a
problem than a solution. The agency had always operated
conservatively, tolerating launch delays whatever the gentle
ridicule from the public or the media. But there came a tendency
among some NASA managers to maybe wink at some problems, among them
an inadequate booster rocket design. After seven scrubs for the
Bill Nelson launch, and two delays getting Challenger off the
ground, NASA rocketry managers didn't want to hear about O-rings on
the morning of Jan. 28, 1986. They wanted to launch, cold weather
or not.
   ``I'm appalled at your recommendation,'' a NASA rocket manager,
George Hardy, said in disgust to engineers who tried to block the
launch.
   It won't happen that way next week. Safety first will rule the
day.
   ``It wouldn't surprise me at all if it took us two or three
times to get airborne,'' says Richard Truly, the ex-astronaut who
now runs the NASA shuttle program. ``We're going to wait until we
have it right, and then we're going to do it.''
