   The fourth man to walk on the moon
doesn't expect more moon walks soon because of America's complacency
toward space discovery.
   Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean, 57, said Sunday he doubted that
bold space initiatives would arise out of the 20th anniversary of
the Apollo 11 mission, which put the first man on the moon.
   But Bean, speaking at Huntsville's Space Celebration '89, said
that doesn't bother him.
   ``It's Americans' way to go hard at a goal, then stand back and
savor that and not go hard at it all the time,'' he said. ``Back in
the days of Apollo, I thought we would have done much more by now.
But I didn't stop and think _ that is not the American way.''
   Bean, who walked on the moon on Nov. 19, 1969, flew aboard Skylab
3 for 59 days in 1973 and has trained astronauts, spoke a day after
Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin addressed the Huntsville
celebration.
   Aldrin had called for putting men on Mars within 20 years.
   ``I hope it's as fast as Buzz is talking about it,'' Bean said.
But he doubts it.
   ``People feel right now, that even though we are not No. 1 in the
world in space .. that if we really wanted to be and really made an
all-out effort like we did with Apollo, we could be No. 1,'' said
Bean, who noted specifically that Soviet endurance experiments in
space had far outstripped U.S. efforts.
   Until the Soviet Union decides to put a man on the moon or take
some other pride-threatening step, Bean expects little change in
Americans' attitudes.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   When that day comes, Bean hopes for space cooperation between the
United States and Soviet Union.
   ``I'd think that would be much better for the Earth,'' said Bean,
who is retired in Houston and spends his time painting space scenes.
