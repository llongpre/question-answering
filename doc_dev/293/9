  [Text] Paris--Two ESA astronauts will represent Europe this 
year in space, by flying with Americans and Russians this fall 
aboard NASA shuttles and the Mir station. 
  For the European Space Agency (ESA), the two flights are a 
way of showing that the world's third-ranking space power, 
Europe, fully intends to defend its place in space exploration, 
and that its personnel and technologies qualify it to 
participate in building the international space station R-Alpha. 
  Europe's collaboration with Russia will begin with the first 
departure of an ESA astronaut--either the Spaniard Pedro Duque 
or the German Ulf Merbold--aboard the Soyuz-TM-20 bound for the 
Mir station. The flight, which will probably take place in 
October, will be similar to Jean-Francois Clervoy's on Columbia 
and will help give European astronauts' the broadest possible 
experience living in space. 
  The designated astronaut will be named in May or June and 
will spend a month aboard the Mir with the Russians. In 1995, 
another European, either Thomas Reiter or the Swede Christer 
Fuglesang, will spend 135 days on the Mir and will even leave 
the station for a walk in space. 
  These EuroMir-94 and -95 missions were planned before the 
final decision to shelve the West's space station Freedom, but 
after the Hermes spaceplane was "scrapped." 
  Jean-Francois Clervoy will be the fifth ESA astronaut, after 
Ulf Merbold (Germany, two flights, in 1983 and 1992), Wubbo 
Ockels (the Netherlands, 1985), Claude Nicollier (Switzerland, 
1992 and 1993), and Dirk Frimout (Belgium, 1992), to fly. 
  Clervoy will be a mission specialist, which means his 
responsibilities will equal those of Nicollier when he 
jettisoned the EURECA platform two years ago, or recovered the 
Hubble Space Telescope last December using the Endeavor 
shuttle's robot arm. 
  Currently there are no plans for another European astronaut 
to fly on American shuttles. But with the Italian Maurizio Cheli 
training as a mission specialist in Houston, surely there will 
be again.
