   Donald and Phyllis Ross say they are proud of
their son's accomplishments aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, even
though they have no idea what his mission was.
   ``Like everyone else we don't know what's going on,'' Ross said.
   Atlantis finished its secret mission and landed Tuesday night at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Ross, 40, was mission specialist for the
flight and helped fly the spacecraft during ascent and re-entry. He
also was on the Atlantis' mission in November 1985, when he walked
in space.
   His parents watched Atlantis' return on a large-screen television
at the Johnson Space Center in Texas, and talked with him a few
hours later.
   ``He said it was a wonderful flight, a real thrilling experience.
I wish he could've told us more about it, but he can't,'' said Mrs.
Ross, 61.
   After the mission, the astronauts met with NASA officials and
relatives, then left for Houston.
   Ross' wife, Karen, and their children, Amy, 17, and Scott, 16,
met Ross at Edwards Air Force Base. The family lives in Texas.
   Communications with the astronauts were blacked out during the
flight on orders from the Air Force, which paid NASA $70 million to
book space on the orbiter.
   Although the mission was clandestine, sources have said it put a
high-tech military spy satellite in an orbit carrying it over 80
percent of the Soviet Union.
