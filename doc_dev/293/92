   Pop star Madonna turned down an invitation to help
launch a charity record for Romanian orphans Wednesday and went
jogging in Hyde Park instead.
   Olivia Harrison, chairwoman of the Romanian Angel Appeal,
invited Madonna to join her husband, former Beatle George Harrison,
and his fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, at a Hyde Park Hotel luncheon
to introduce the record ``Nobody's Child.''
   But Madonna, who is staying at the hotel, went for a run in the
park surrounded by eight burly bodyguards. She was followed by a
posse of reporters, photographers and fans.
   Proceeds from the record will provide food and clothing and
improve training and care at orphanages in Romania, Mrs. Harrison
said.
   Madonna's ``Blonde Ambition'' tour starts its British leg Friday
night at Wembley Stadium.

   Dimitrios I, spiritual leader of 250
million Orthodox Christians, arrived here Wednesday to attend a
service in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's oldest American parish.
   A crowd stood three deep on the sidewalk outside St. Mary's
Ukrainian Orthodox Church to greet Dimitrios, the first Orthodox
patriarch to come to the United States, home of 6 million Eastern
Orthodox Christians.
   Dimitrios, 75, waved to the crowd as he walked slowly up the
steps to the church, which was built in 1917. Young girls dressed
in traditional Ukrainian and Greek clothing scattered rose petals
in his path.
   ``We're really excited. It's the equivalent of the pope showing
up in Allentown,'' said Tanya Miller, 18, whose great-grandparents
came from the Ukraine.
   Dimitrios began his monthlong tour of the United States July 2
in Washington.

   Harry Caray is back in the bleachers.
   Caray, in his 46th season as a sportscaster and ninth with the
Cubs, broadcast Tuesday's San Diego-Chicago game from the bleachers
in center field.
   Caray began the tradition of working from the bleachers once a
year during the 1970s when he was with the Chicago White Sox.
   He kept doing it after joining the Cubs in 1982 but skipped it
the last two years after suffering a stroke in February 1988.
   ``I feel great and I enjoy being out there with the fans, it's a
lot of fun,'' he said.
   Chicago won 7-2.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August
Wilson says his nine-year marriage could not compete with his
devotion to work.
   Wilson said Tuesday he would soon move to Seattle without his
wife, school social worker Judy Oliver, and that they planned to
divorce.
   For the past five years, Wilson said, he has been home only
about three months a year.
   `It's real hard to maintain a marriage and do the work at the
same time,'' said Wilson. ``I was never there for her.''
   Wilson, whose plays chronicle black experience in 20th-century
America, has twice won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. The first was
in 1987 for ``Fences,'' and the second in April for ``The Piano
Lesson.''
   He has lived in St. Paul since 1978.

   Veterans of the only joint Soviet-U.S. manned
space mission held a reunion to mark the 15th anniversary of the
flight and encouraged more international cooperation in space.
   On July 17, 1975, an Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet
Soyuz craft, orbiting the Earth in tandem at speeds of more than
18,000 mph. Four of the mission's five veterans met Tuesday to
commemorate the history-making event.
   Apollo-Soyuz ``showed it is possible for people who have great
differences to cooperate in space,'' cosmonaut Valery N. Kubasov
said at a news conference at the Museum of Science and Industy.
   Also present were retired Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford, commander
of the Apollo mission, astronaut Donald K. ``Deke'' Slayton and
Maj. Gen. Alexi Leonov, the Soyuz commander. Leonov was the first
person to walk in space and is chief of cosmonaut training in
Moscow.
   Astronaut Vance Brand missed the reunion.
