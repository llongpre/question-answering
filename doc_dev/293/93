   Two veteran astronauts, heirs to a
daredevil tradition, were grounded by NASA for risky flying after
one was involved in a fatal crash and another flew too close to an
airliner.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson and Navy Capt. David M.
Walker, both shuttle commanders, were disciplined Monday for
violating Johnson Space Center flight crew guidelines.
   ``This is the first time we have removed crew members from
flights for disciplinary reasons,'' said NASA spokesman Jeff Carr.
   One space expert said the pair may just have had too much of the
right stuff.
   ``It's a special breed of man who wants to climb to the top of
the heap in the most dangerous profession there is,'' said Lloyd
Swenson, a space history expert at the University of Houston.
   Swenson said astronauts realize ``working with high-performance
aircrafts in a test capacity is putting the human body as well as
the human mind at risk. Unfortunately, sometimes those people who
like to do those tests make an error in judgment.''
   Gibson, 43, was pulled from shuttle flight assignments and
barred for a year from making T-38 jet trainer flights for
violating a policy that restricts high-risk recreational activities
for astronauts named to flight crews, Carr said.
   The move followed a weekend air show race near New Braunfels,
Texas, in which Gibson's stunt plane collided with another stunt
plane, sending the other pilot hurtling to his death in a corn
field. Gibson landed his plane safely.
   Walker, 46, was suspended for 60 days for infractions that
included an incident last year in which the T-38 he was flying came
within 100 feet of a Pan Am jetliner in a near-collision outside
Washington, Carr said.
   Gibson had piloted an eight-day Challenger mission in 1984 and
commanded a 1986 Columbia mission and a 1988 Atlantis mission.
   Walker piloted a shuttle flight in 1984 and was commander of
Atlantis during a four-day flight in 1989.
   Walker did not return a call Monday. Gibson has an unlisted
number.
   Harlan J. Smith of the University of Texas at Austin, who has
taught science to astronauts, said they are risk-takers by nature.
   ``The work is so fascinating that they volunteer for a duty
where the know the risk every time the rockets are lit, and they
rather cheerfully take that risk,'' Smith said.
   But Smith said NASA must keep them from daredevil conduct off
duty because ``an awful lot has been invested in these people.''
   Swenson indicated the astronauts would understand their
punishments.
   ``They're jet jockeys, no doubt about that. But they're also
Naval officers who are used to discipline,'' he said. Swenson
chronicled NASA history from 1963 to 1973, providing research for
Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff'' on the Mercury astronauts.
   Carr said the timing of the two groundings was coincidence. The
decision to ground Walker was made a week ago, but the announcement
was delayed while authorities searched for a replacement for him on
next year's Pentagon shuttle flight, Carr said.
   Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory will replace Walker as crew
commander on that flight.
   Gibson, widely regarded as one of the shuttle program's most
skilled fliers, was slated to command a fourth mission late next
year. NASA did not immediately name a replacement.
   Meanwhile, the precise location of the hydrogen leak that
grounded the shuttle fleet still eludes NASA engineers, but
officials are looking for a test on Atlantis later this week to
provide answers.
   A laboratory test in California over the weekend confirmed there
is a problem in the design or assembly of a liquid hydrogen
plumbing system on the shuttle, the space agency said.
   William Lenoir, NASA space flight director, said engineers plan
a full-scale leak test on Atlantis on Friday or Saturday.
   Witnesses said space shuttle astronaut S. David Griggs was
killed performing aerial stunts when his World War II vintage plane
crashed in an Arksansas wheat field on June 17, 1989.
