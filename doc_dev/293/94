   NASA disclosed nothing but the lunch
menu Saturday as astronauts aboard space shuttle Atlantis reportedly
deployed a top-secret spy satellite that can peer down at the
Soviets through clouds and darkness.
   The public space-to-ground radio link was kept silent while the
five military men went about their business on the second day of the
mission, which began with Friday's launch and is under the control
of the Air Force.
   NASA said in advance it would break the silence only if major
problems developed aboard the spacecraft.
   By all accounts, Saturday was to have been the crew's busiest
day, with the expected release of the $500 million Lacrosse
satellite, but the only official word on the mission came from NASA,
which released the menu: salmon, ham, macaroni and cheese and turkey
tetrazzini.
   Sources have said the satellite is capable of recording sharp
images of military targets in the East Bloc. Weighing 18 tons and
with a solar panel wingspan of 150 feet, the satellite, according to
sources, will help verify Soviet compliance with arms treaties and
serve as a ``radar eye'' for the stealth bomber.
   The Soviet news agency Tass' apparently knows plenty about the
satellite, reporting many details about it, including the code name
Lacrosse.
   Atlantis' secret mission began with a spectacular public blastoff
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., during a momentary calm in fierce,
upper-level winds similar to those that halted the launch on
Thursday.
   Four hours after the shuttle blazed across the clear sky on a
northward course, Mission Control broke the silence, saying: ``The
crew of Atlantis is go for orbit operations.''
   That announcement meant that the spaceship's cargo bay doors were
open and the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could
begin.
   Only military men are aboard Atlantis, serving under Navy Cmdr.
Robert L. Gibson, the commander. The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy
S. Gardner, and the mission specialists are Col. Richard M. Mullane
and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William
M. Shepherd.
   According to pre-flight reports, Mullane was to be inside the
shuttle cabin using the orbiter's robot arm to hoist the satellite
out of the cargo bay and release it when Atlantis was in a precise
location and position.
   The procedure was so intricate that Shepherd and Ross were to be
in space-walking suits, prepared to go into the cargo bay if any
problems arose in releasing the satellite. Normally, astronauts do
not suit up for satellite launches.
   Once Lacrosse is in orbit 240 miles high, Gibson and Gardner then
were to fly alongside the satellite until ground controllers were
certain it was working properly.
   The satellite's course reportedly will often take it over the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where it can observe military
operations through darkness and cloud cover.
   The crew also planned to conduct several experiments aimed at
defining the role of military observers in space, with reconnaisance
a high priority, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device
resembling hand-held binoculars.
   The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises
that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballistic
missile launches.
   The flight, the second since the Challenger disaster, the 27th
shuttle mission overall and the third dedicated to the military, is
expected to end Monday or Tuesday with the landing at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.
   NASA and the Air Force plan to give 24-hour notice of the landing.
