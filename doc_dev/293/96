   Two cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station
Mir are awaiting delivery of a ladder so they can repair the space
ship that would speed them back to Earth in case of an emergency.
   The ladder is to be carried aloft aboard an unmanned resupply
craft that is scheduled for launch on June 1, the magazine Aviation
Week and Space Technology says in its May 21 issue.
   The Soviets had disclosed previously that the Soyuz TM-9
spacecraft was damaged, apparently when it was launched Feb. 11 en
route to the Mir with cosmonauts Anatoli Solovyev and Aleksandr
Balandin. Three of the ship's eight thermal blankets came loose.
   ``This is a situation which generally requires attention, of
course, but it probably is not all that serious,'' one of the
cosmonauts said in a three-minute excerpt carried on Soviet radio
on March 9. He said he and his companion were prepared for a space
walk.
   The Soviets use small Soyuz capsules to transport cosmonauts to
and from the space station. Sometimes the crews will ride their own
Soyuz back to Earth, at other times a crew that has been aboard the
Mir will travel in a Soyuz brought by other cosmonauts. The space
station has several docking ports.
   Aviation Week interviewed cosmonaut Alexander A. Serebrov, who
recently returned from the Mir, where he photographe the damaged
Soyuz TM-9 vehicle from his own TM-8 spacecraft.
   The pictures show large thermal blankets on the outside of the
TM-9 have been ripped out of place. The magazine said they are
blocking key sensors needed to align the spacecraft properly for
re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.
   In addition, the vehicle's metal skin has been exposed to space,
degrading its ability to control temperature inside.
   ``The Soyuz has become cold, causing a buildup of water
condensation in the vehicle,'' Aviation Week said. It quoted
Serebrov as saying engineers are concerned that the condensation
could cause an electrical malfunction during re-entry.
   Some repair materials were aboard an unmanned resupply vehicle,
Progress 42, which docked with Mir on May 8. The ladder is expected
to arrive aboard an unmanned Kristall module.
