   During a three-hour space walk, cosmonauts at the
Mir orbiting complex installed equipment to improve their craft's
navigation system, the official Tass news agency said today.
   Cosmonauts Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov were in
good health after completing the mission early today, Tass said,
adding that installation of the two ``stellar transducers'' was a
success.
   Radio Moscow said the new sensors were required because of the
docking last month of another research module that changed the
configuration of the Mir complex to an L-shape. That made a new
orientation system necessary, it said.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov have been aboard the Mir complex since
September, when they remanned it after it had been left empty for
six months while new experiments were being prepared.
   Radio Moscow said the cosmonauts have four more space walks on
their schedule before they return to Earth in mid-February.
