   The owners of a communications
satellite that fell into a useless orbit said Wednesday they will
pay NASA to send up astronauts to repair the $157 million
spacecraft.
   NASA tentatively set the rescue mission for the 1992 inaugural
flight of the space shuttle Endeavour.
   The rescue of the unisured satellite is expected to cost
Intelsat more than half of the $146.5 million price for a
non-government shuttle mission.
   ``NASA has the technological know-how to reboost the satellite,
and we want to take advantage of NASA's expertise so we can boost
the satellite and it will have a 10-year lifespan,'' said company
spokesman Tony Trujillo.
   Intelsat's board of governors authorized the rescue attempt
during a weeklong meeting in Barbados that ended Wednesday.
   The satellite is orbiting at about 345 miles above Earth, 22,000
miles lower than intended. It was even lower when it failed to
separate properly from a Titan 3 rocket on March 14, but Intelsat
ground controllers managed to boost it.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said last
month it would try to save the satellite if Intelsat paid for the
mission. Last week, the federal Office of Management and Budget
approved NASA's proposed $130 million pricetag _ in 1988 dollars _
for non-government shuttle flights. That amounts to $146.5 million
for fiscal 1990.
   Intelsat will cover a ``sizable fraction'' of the expense since
other cargos will be on board, said NASA payload manager William D.
Green.
   The plan calls for Endeavour to carry a 20,000-pound motor that
will be attached to the satellite in the payload bay by
space-walking astronauts. The motor will contain a safety device to
prevent it from firing until the shuttle is at a safe distance.
   Intelsat ground controllers will send a command that will ignite
the motor and boost the 5-ton satellite to its proper stationary
orbit.
   The February 1992 date would not disrupt other shuttle flights,
Green said.
   ``Generally speaking, the reason we're doing it is we're in the
business of providing space services when people ask for it,'' he
said.
   NASA has twice repaired satellites in space _ in 1984 and 1985 _
and brought back two other disabled spacecraft.
   ``For this to be practical, a satellite that's in trouble has to
be within the reach of the shuttle, in the altitude region,'' Green
said.
   Discovery's flight in April with the Hubble Space Telescope set
a record altitude _ 380 miles _ for a shuttle. A shuttle probably
could reach 400 or so miles without any cargo, Green said.
   Intelsat, a Washington, D.C.-based consortium of 119 countries
that operates a global communications satellite system, was not
interested in having the satellite returned to Earth for repair
because of the expense and delay in getting it back up.
   The Intelsat VI satellite was to have replaced two older
Intelsat satellites over the Atlantic. Once in proper orbit, it
will be capable of transmitting three TV channels and up to 120,000
telephone calls simultaneously.
   Intelsat's service will not be disrupted by the three-year
delay, Trujillo said. Fourteen Intelsat satellites currently are in
orbit, and a Titan 3 is scheduled to carry up another one later
this month.
   Martin Marietta Corp., which makes the Titan rockets, said the
engineering design error that led to the failed launch in March has
been corrected.
