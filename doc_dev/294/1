   Two cosmonauts whose mission was plagued by
technical problems and a perilous spacewalk returned to Earth on
Thursday with a multimillion-ruble payload of space-grown crystals.
   The Soyuz TM-9 capsule carrying Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander
Balandin landed on the Central Asian steppes at 11:34 a.m., one
minute ahead of schedule.
   The landing was not broadcast live on Soviet television. But the
midday ``Vremya'' TV news program showed the cosmonauts waving
goodbye to their replacement crew before leaving the orbiting space
station Mir.
   ``Back in the landing spaceship, we felt the slightly bitter
smell of absinthe in the Kazakh steppe,'' Solovyev told reporters
after landing and ending his six-month stay in space.
   ``I also dreamed that my wife would bring me fresh delicious
apples when I was back on Earth,'' he said in remarks carried by
the Tass news agency.
   Solovyev and Balandin were launched into space Feb. 11 in what
was trumpeted as the first manned mission in the 33-year history of
the Soviet space program to turn a multimillion-dollar profit.
   They conducted hundreds of experiments, photographed 8.4 million
square miles of the Earth's surface and grew 23 pure crystals for
semiconductors and computer chips, Tass said.
   Tass said they also studied the influence of space flight on the
development and behavior of birds, and that this would help develop
life-support systems for future manned spacecraft.
   Crystals grown in the zero-gravity environment of space tend to
have far fewer imperfections, such as ripples or other impurites,
than those produced on Earth. The crystals are sliced into thin
sheets and etched to create tiny circuits, or semiconductors, with
optimum conductivity.
   Tass said each of the 23 crystals grown on the Mir station was
worth $1 million, but the news agency did not say how big the
crystals were or what material they were grown from.
   A $23 million profit from the space venture likely would help
the cash-hungry Soviet government fend off criticism about the cost
of its space program.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressure has grown on the
costly, but once sacrosanct, space program to prove its worth in a
society where many people do not have decent housing or enough
quality food to eat.
   Future expeditions to Mir will carry paying passengers. The
first will be an employee of the Tokyo Broadcasting System, who
will have a seat on an eight-day mission beginning Dec. 2.
   The Japanese passenger will return to Earth with the two
cosmonauts currently aboard Mir, Gennady Manakov and Gennady
Strekalov.
   Manakov and Strekalov, who replaced Solovyev and Balandin,
docked with the space station Aug. 3, two days after blasting off
from the Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan.
   They will conduct an estimated 250 experiments over the next six
months, including growing more crystals and making two spacewalks.
   Solovyev and Balandin made a life-threatening spacewalk July 17
to repair their capsule's thermal insulation, which was torn on
takeoff. The repairs took seven hours, longer than anticipated, and
their life-support supplies nearly ran out.
   Having damaged the exit-and-entry hatch at the beginning of the
spacewalk, the cosmonauts were forced to return through an
emergency porthole. In their haste, they left behind handrails
attached to the exterior of the capsule.
   A second spacewalk was required July 26 to retrieve the
handrails and fix the hatch.
