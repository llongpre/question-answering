   A still-unexplained problem has
developed with a computerized display unit in space shuttle
Columbia, but it is not expected to delay this week's launch, a
NASA official said today.
   Technicians replaced the so-called ``heads-up display,'' which
projects data used by the shuttle's commander during landing, on
Sunday night, but that did not fix the problem. NASA tried to
determine today what was wrong with the display unit's related
equipment.
   ``That's really our only real problem. Everything else is going
very smoothly,'' NASA test director Al Sofge said at a morning
briefing.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday.
   After the unit was removed, it tested normally and the
replacement unit was not working, prompting NASA officials to
suspect a related piece of equipment _ the display unit's
electronics package, Sofge said.
   Sofge said officials should know by midday whether the problem
indeed lies with that electronics package. If necessary,
technicians will replace the device, about the size of a
videocassette recorder and located in the middeck.
   It will take about eight hours to replace the electronics
package and another eight hours to test it, Sofge said. That work
can be performed while other countdown procedures continue, he said.
   There is ``a very remote possibility'' the problem could lie
with yet another part, the display unit's power control assembly,
but even that wouldn't necessarily delay the launch, Sofge said.
   ``If it turns out that it is the PCA, we still think we can go
ahead and change that out and make the launch date,'' he said.
   The mission already has been delayed two weeks because of
repairs to the shuttle's cooling system at the launch pad.
   Columbia's seven astronauts, meanwhile, say they are eager to
get started on a mission to explore high-energy ultraviolet light
and X-rays emitted from stars and galaxies.
   ``Everything's big on this mission,'' Columbia commander Vance
Brand said Sunday. ``We have a big crew. We have a lot of days on
orbit, nine or 10, and we think a lot of good and important things
to do.''
   The crew _ the biggest since the 1986 Challenger explosion _
arrived late Sunday morning in five trainer jets from Johnson Space
Center in Houston. The countdown began as planned at 1 a.m. Sunday.
   ``We know we have a great ship, and we're ready to go,'' Brand
said.
   Air Force forecasters were predicting an 80 percent chance of
favorable weather at launch time.
   Columbia will be carrying a $150 million observatory called
Astro that will be operated round-the-clock by four crew members
who are astronomers. Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes and one
X-ray telescope will scan space from Columbia's payload bay as the
shuttle orbits 218 miles above Earth.
   Because of the flight's duration, five sets of fuel storage
tanks will be used instead of the customary three to provide power
to the orbiting shuttle, Leinbach said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration loaded the
on-board tanks with liquid oxygen and hydrogen this morning.
   Technicians on Sunday finished restocking the X-ray telescope
with argon, needed to keep its heat-sensitive instruments cold.
Columbia has six days in which to lift off, after which the flight
will be delayed a week so more argon can be added.
   It will be the first mission since 1985 to use components of
Spacelab, a research facility designed for orbiting shuttles.
Crewmen will use Spacelab computers in the rear flight deck to
operate Astro, anchored in the payload bay.
   No spacewalks are planned, although astronauts Mike Lounge and
Jeffrey Hoffman are prepared to venture outside the cabin if one of
the telescopes needs repairs or readjustment.
   Astro will probe ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from
stars, the Comet Austin and other matter in space. Little is known
about those kinds of radiation because the wavelengths cannot
penetrate the atmosphere and thus cannot be studied from the ground.
