<LEADPARA>  The five astronauts aboard the space shuttle Atlantis spent Saturday preparing
for two days of intense activity, including the first spacewalk in more than
five years, and took a few minutes off to talk with schoolchildren about the
adventures of space flight.;    Today, physicist Linda M. Godwin, 38, will use
the shuttle's robotic arm to lift a $617 million observatory out of Atlantis'
cargo bay. The 35,000-pound observatory will dangle on the end of the arm for
several hours until all its systems have been checked, and then Godwin will
set the instrument free to study the universe in ways that it has never been
studied before.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Gamma Ray Observatory has been designed to spend two years examining
objects that emit gamma rays, the most powerful form of radiation in the
electromagnetic spectrum. However, scientists expect it to operate for much
longer than its design life -- possibly as long as eight years. Gamma rays can
only be studied from space.;    Atmospheric pressure in the interior of
Atlantis was lowered Saturday from 14.7 pounds per square inch, which is
sea-level pressure, to 10.2 psi to pave the way for a spacewalk if anything
goes wrong during the deployment of the observatory.;    It is necessary to
reduce the pressure inside the vehicle to prevent the astronauts from going
through the bends, similar to what happens to deep-sea divers when they
surface too quickly, after they re-enter the shuttle.;    Even if they do not
have to leave the shuttle today, astronauts Jerry L. Ross, 43, and Jay Apt,
41, will go out Monday to test equipment that could be used later this decade
in the construction of the planned space station Freedom.;    Atlantis has
been enjoying a near-perfect mission since its launch Friday.;    "This has
been a really clean flight," said flight director Chuck Shaw.;    The
astronauts took time to chat with schoolchildren by way of amateur radio
linkups, and they got at least one question that showed that even the very
young can wonder about the meaning of it all.;    "Do you tend to re-evaluate
your life when you look at the Earth?" a young boy asked the shuttle's pilot,
Kenneth Cameron, 41.;    "When you float up here above the Earth in a little
spacecraft and look down at the big spacecraft that we all fly on, it makes us
all think about what our priorities are," Cameron answered.;    The flight is
scheduled to end at 6:34 a.m. PDT Wednesday with a landing at Edwards Air
Force Base in Southern California.;    Atlantis is commanded by Steven R.
Nagel, 44.  </TEXT>
