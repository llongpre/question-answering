   Veteran cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko appeared at a
news conference on Thursday to show the world he was in fine fettle
after his record 326-day space voyage.
   The red-cheeked, 43-year-old Romanenko said he had just come
back from a vacation in Kislovodsk, where he had been doing
push-ups and other exercises to readjust his body to gravity after
11 months of weightlessness.
   Romanenko, who returned to Earth on Dec. 29, said there were
Italian news reports that he suffered ill health effects from the
flight, and he wanted to disprove them.
   ``I feel fine,'' he declared.
   A Soviet space medical specialist and other space officials at
the news conference agreed that Romanenko, the mission commander,
was in good shape.
   Romanenko also assured reporters that a fellow spaceman was in
no serious danger when pressure in his spacesuit suddenly dropped
during a 3-hour, 40-minute spacewalk on April 12, 1987.
   Cosmonaut Alexander Laveikin and Romanenko had embarked on the
spacewalk to learn why their orbital space station Mir was not able
to dock properly with a laboratory module called Kvant.
   Romanenko said a lever switched in the incorrect position caused
a loss of air pressure in Laveikin's spacesuit. Asked if the
depressurization was life-threatening, he responded, ``There was
nothing particularly scary about it.''
   He said normally the suit should be kept at 0.45 atmospheric
units but the level dropped to 0.35 because a lever that controls
pressure was set incorrectly.
   Romanenko said the cosmonaut contacted mission controllers in
the Soviet Union, who transmitted a command to regulate the
pressure and ``within moments the pressure was back to normal, that
is 0.45.''
   On the spacewalk, Laveikin and Romanenko found what was
preventing Mir from docking with the Kvant module: an ``alien
object'' had gotten into the docking unit. Romanenko said Thursday
the object was a cloth bag containing ``hygenic devices.''
   The cosmonauts removed the bag and mission controllers sent a
signal that successfully docked Mir and Kvant. Soviet scientists
had tried for a week to rescue the 11-ton Kvant, which is used to
conduct a variety of experiments, including those in biotechnology
and astrophysics.
