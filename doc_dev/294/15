<LEADPARA>  Two Soviet cosmonauts spent more than six hours on a spacewalk outside their
orbital station Saturday, completing the installation of two hoists on the
outside of the complex, Moscow media reported. Cmdr. Viktor Afanasyev and
flight engineer Musa Manarov, who have been aboard the Mir complex for nearly
two months, assembled the telescopic booms that will be used to transfer solar
batteries from one part of the space station to another, the Tass news agency
reported.;    Afanasyev and Manarov also installed laser reflectors that can
be used as beacons for unmanned space ferries and space shuttles arriving at
the Mir, Radio Moscow said. Ground controllers did not impose a rigid schedule
on the cosmonauts, who spent 6 hours and 20 minutes in space, and completed
everything they planned to do, reports said. That contrasted sharply with a
troubled spacewalk in July by cosmonauts Alexander Solovyov and Alexander
Balandin, who had trouble closing a balky hatch during their excursion outside
the Mir. Afanasyev and Manarov were launched to the Mir on Dec. 2.  </LEADPARA>
