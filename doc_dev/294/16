<HEAD>Cosmonauts Make Spacewalk To Fix Telescope</HEAD>

   Two cosmonauts left the orbiting space station Mir
today to make a second attempt to repair a Dutch-made telescope,
Radio Moscow reported.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov were using new tools and
materials brought to the space station by the cargo ferry ship
Progress recently, the broadcast said.
   Titov and Manarov had tried unsuccessfully in a five-hour space
walk June 30 to replace a detector unit on the telescope, which was
mounted on an observatory attached to Mir. Components of the unit
melted because of exposure to cosmic radiation, Radio Moscow said.
The problem in the June repair attempt was that the cosmonauts
couldn't unfasten the clasp holding the balky detector unit to the
telescope, the Tass news agency said at the time.
   In today's space walk, scheduled to last several hours, Titov
and Manarov were wearing new spacesuits designed to allow the
cosmonauts more flexibility, Soviet television reported.
   Titov and Manarov have been aboard Mir since last December and
are scheduled to set a new space endurance record before returning
to Earth this December, Soviet officials have said.
   A third cosmonaut, Dr. Valery Polyakov, arrived aboard Mir in
September to monitor the health of Titov and Manarov. Polyakov
stayed inside the space station during Thursday's spacewalk to
check on-board systems and the health of Titov and Manarov, Tass
said.
   The Mir station was launched Feb. 20, 1986 and the Kvant
orbiting observatory was attached to it in early 1987.
