<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Krikalev's Debut on `Discovery' </F>
Was Successful, But the Satellite's Debut was Not"] 
  [Text] The landing of the "Discovery" space shuttle at the 
Canaveral space center at 2050 on 11 February marks the end of 
the first ever flight when U.S. astronauts and a Russian 
cosmonaut have been members of the same crew. Unfortunately, 
the attempts to place the "Wake Shield" satellite in orbit ended 
in failure. Sergey Krikalev was going to work with the 
satellite, which had been carried in the cargo bay. 
  The satellite was to have moved to a distance of 75 km from 
the space shuttle. At that distance, with no microgravitation 
at all and no effect from the station's exhaust gases, there 
would have been an experiment to grow extremely pure 
semiconductor films for new-generation computers. But the 
guidance system of the manipulator, which would have been used 
to move the satellite, turned out to be faulty. 
  This failure is very regrettable, since this faulty 
manipulator will be used to assemble the components of the 
"Alfa" international station when it is created. After many 
attempts the astronauts did manage to obtain seven laminated 
electronic components of reasonable quality in the satellite 
factory, but they were not as fine as had been expected. 
  According to the U.S. specialists, Sergey Krikalev performed 
very well, despite the relative failure of the main experiment. 
Any aberrations in the operation of the vehicle were instantly 
eliminated by our engineer. 
  In a year's time a second Russian cosmonaut -- Colonel 
Vladimir Titov -- will fly in the shuttle. During this flight 
the shuttle will approach our "Mir" station for the first time 
and Titov will perform a spacewalk. A docking between "Mir" and 
the shuttle is planned for spring 1995. Incidentally, this week 
U.S. astronauts Norman Thagard, 51, and Bonnie Dunbar, 45 (wife 
of astronaut Ronald Sega, who was on the "Discovery" flight), 
started training sessions at the Cosmonaut Training Center near 
Moscow. The long flight by a U.S. astronaut on the Russian 
"Mir" station is to begin on 1 March 1995.
