   NASA, in a rare move, advanced the
launch date Saturday for the shuttle Discovery and its prestigious
payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   Discovery now is due to lift off April 10, two days earlier than
planned.
   ``The shuttle team is ready to fly. Hubble is one of the most
exciting payloads ever launched aboard the shuttle, and we're
looking forward to the mission,'' said William Lenoir, associate
administrator for space flight for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   The space agency's Flight Readiness Review Board decided to move
up the mission after meeting for two days at Kennedy Space Center.
   NASA said last week technicians needed little of the contingency
time built into Discovery's prelaunch schedule.
   Once deployed by Discovery's astronauts, the Hubble will orbit
380 miles above Earth for 15 years. The telescope will be capable
of looking seven times more deeply into space with greater clarity
and detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best ground-based
observatory.
   Astronomers expect to use it to study stars and galaxies so
distant that their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14
billion years.
   NASA occasionally has shifted shuttle launch dates because of
scheduling changes in the months prior to liftoff. But it is the
first time liftoff has been accelerated during orbiter processing.
   In February, Discovery's launch date was changed from April 18
to April 12 after the lower right segment of the shuttle's solid
rocket booster was replaced more quickly than anticipated.
   The telescope's installation into the orbiter was delayed last
week, however, after small mosquito-like insects called midges
invaded a payload preparation room at the launch pad. Engineers
feared the bugs might damage the sensitive instrument, the most
expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built.
   Forty midges were trapped, and technicians loaded the
25,000-pound telescope into the shuttle's payload bay Thursday, two
days later than planned.
   Mission specialist Bruce McCandless II, one of Discovery's five
astronauts, helped link electrical connections between Discovery
and Hubble on Friday. He also checked the telescope for sharp edges
that might snag spacesuits in the event of a spacewalk.
   McCandless and mission specialist Kathryn Sullivan are prepared
to step into space should the telescope need to be adjusted or
repaired following deployment. It would be the first American
spacewalk since 1985.
   Technicians planned to test the telescope's systems and
scientific instruments Sunday. They want to ensure remote
communications with the Space Telescope Operations Control Center
at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and other
facilities.
   The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P.
Hubble, who discovered in the 1920s the universe is constantly
expanding, a finding that is the basis for the current Big Bang
theory of the formation of the universe.
