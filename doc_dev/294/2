   Two spacewalking cosmonauts had to use an
emergency hatch to re-enter their spacecraft because their normal
porthole malfunctioned and their life support supplies were running
out, Soviet media said Wednesday.
   The incident, which Soviet television called life-threatening,
occurred while Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin were trying
to fix thermal insulation on the outside of their spacecraft.
   It was the latest in a series of problems plaguing the
cosmonauts' six-month mission.
   Despite the danger, the cosmonauts joked about it afterward.
Solovyev quipped that flight controllers ``need to put road signs
there'' on the outside of the huge craft, Soviet television's
evening news program Vremya said.
   ``Midnight Emergency in Outer Space,'' was the headline of a
front-page story in Wednesday's Izvestia newspaper. The article
raised the possibility human error could be behind the hatch
problem and that the cosmonauts might have to take another
spacewalk for more repairs before they can return to Earth safely.
   ``Was there a threat to the crew's lives? Yes, there was,''
Vremya said.
   A U.S. specialist on the Soviet space program said the hatch
problem may prevent Solovyev, the 42-year-old flight commander, and
Balandin, the 36-year-old engineer, from taking another spacewalk.
   The Soviet Union's manned space program, which for decades has
been a source of national pride, has been plagued the past two
years by equipment malfunctions, mistakes by cosmonauts and budget
cuts.
   The cosmonauts on Tuesday left Mir, the space station orbiting
for four years, to fix thermal insulation around the capsule they
must use to return to Earth.
   Nearly half the insulation on the Soyuz TM-9 capsule, which is
docked to Mir, has peeled off, news reports have said.
   After repairing some of the damaged insulation, the cosmonauts,
who were working without tethers or hoses connected to the ship,
encountered the hatch problem.
   ``During their return to the spaceship, the crew experienced
unexpected difficulties,'' Radio Moscow said. ``The cosmonauts
failed to shut the door of the entrance chamber and had to make use
of an emergency door to enter the station.''
   James Oberg, author of several books on the Soviet space
program, said although the cosmonauts managed to climb back into
Mir safely, the hatch problem could complicate future spacewalks.
   ``The general crisis was not fully resolved,'' Oberg said in a
telephone interview Wednesday from his Texas home.
   He said the cosmonauts may be unable to take another spacewalk
because equipment needed to recharge their spacesuits with air and
other vital supplies is now inaccessible in the damaged airlock.
   Soviet officials at the Soviet Mission Control Center in
Kaliningrad, north of Moscow, tried to minimize the problem.
   ``No one is concerned here. It is an abnormal situation but
controllable,'' Vsyeva Latyshev, a center spokesman, said in a
telephone interview.
   Izvestia said it took Solovyev and Balandin three hours to reach
their damaged capsule after crawling out of Mir and scampering
along its outer skin using fasteners like mountain climbers. They
managed to fold part of the damaged insulation using clamps but
another damaged piece wouldn't budge.
   Radio Moscow reported the cosmonauts determined the insulation,
which protects the capsule while in space, was damaged during
launch of the Soyuz on Feb. 11. The thermal blanket, flapping
uselessly in space for months, could have interfered with the
cosmonauts' safe return to Earth.
   Izvestia said life support resources of the cosmonauts'
spacesuits approached their six-hour limit.
   They were running so low on air that they had to ``feed'' their
spacesuits outside the ship, Izvestia reported, apparently drawing
oxygen from the vessel.
   In their rush, the cosmonauts apparently did not remove their
ladders from the outside, Izvestia reported. It said ground
controllers ``cannot rule out'' that Solovyev and Balandin will
have to take another spacewalk in the next few days. It did not say
whether the walk would be needed to remove the ladders or to repair
the balky hatch.
   The malfunctioning hatch is on Kvant-2, a module attached to
Mir, and must be closed so the cosmonauts can pressurize the
chamber.
   The cosmonauts apparently closed an inner hatch to seal one end
of the airlock that leads to the troublesome outside hatch. That
airlock apparently contains equipment they use for their spacewalks.
   On Tuesday, the spacemen were unable to close the hatch after
they entered the airlock ``either because of the rush, tiredness or
some other unknown reason,'' Izvestia said.
   Tass said Solovyev and Balandin had to re-enter through another
hatch on Kvant-2 that leads into a compartment for scientific
equipment.
   The repairs and re-entry took seven hours, about two hours
longer than scheduled.
   Latyshev said ground controllers planned to bring the two
cosmonauts home in the Soyuz capsule as scheduled Aug. 9.
   A replacement crew for Mir is to be launched Aug. 1.
