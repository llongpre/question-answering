<LEADPARA>  NASA told Columbia's astronauts today that they may have to perform an
emergency spacewalk to fix or remove a loose seal that could prevent proper
closing of the space shuttle's cargo bay doors.;    "We're trying to determine
by analysis if we'll be able to close the door safely with the environmental
seal where it is currently," Mission Control's Jan Davis told the crew. "We
have a lot of good folks working on that, and we're hopeful we can clear it by
analysis."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "If we can't, there's a possibility that we'll do" a spacewalk, Davis said.
She said a spacewalk would not be made before Saturday. The flight is
scheduled to last nine days.;    The cargo bay doors must be closed tightly
for the shuttle to safely make the fiery re-entry through the atmosphere. Two
of the astronauts -- Tamara Jernigan and James Bagian -- are trained in
spacewalking in case the doors must be closed manually.;    Loose insulation; 
Television pictures beamed to the ground Wednesday showed that several white
blankets of insulation had come loose in the payload bay. And some
weatherstripping, a long sealing belt, also came loose along the edge of one
of the doors that covers the bay during launch and landing.;    Engineers
still were assessing the situation to see if the doors can be shut tightly by
themselves at the end of the mission.;    Columbia's astronauts began their
second day of experiments inside Spacelab this morning, drawing more blood
from one another as part of NASA's most in-depth biomedical research mission.;
   Four of the seven astronauts didn't have far to go when they woke up. They
slept inside the pressurized laboratory module in the shuttle's cargo bay.;   
"They all thought it was a great place to sleep," shuttle commander Bryan
O'Connor said.;    Television images beamed down from space showed cell
biologist Millie Hughes-Fulford calmly taking blood from F. Andrew Gaffney, a
cardiologist. He offered his left arm casually.;    Less than an hour later,
Bagian, a physician, took more blood from Gaffney. Again, he did not flinch.; 
  M. Rhea Seddon, another physician, told Mission Control today it was taking
a little longer than anticipated to collect the blood samples.;    "It's still
running a little ragged because everything takes longer and people are
scattered and veins are not cooperating. But I think we're getting it all
done," Seddon said.;    Smiling rat;  She also said that the rats aboard the
flight looked good, joking that two of them she checked "looked happy. One was
smiling at us, and the other one was sleeping. They looked real clean and real
nice." In all, there are 29 white rats and 2,478 tiny jellyfish on board for
the biomedical research.;    The four men and three women, delayed twice in
two weeks because of faulty equipment, rode into orbit Wednesday after waiting
85 minutes for the weather to improve at Cape Canaveral, Fla.;    Spacelab, a
pressurized laboratory module in the cargo bay, quickly was powered up, and
the four medical specialists on board began taking the first of daily blood
and urine samples and blood pressure readings planned during the nine-day
mission.;    Bill Huffstetler, a NASA scientist at the Marshall Space Flight
Center, said Wednesday that television views of the laboratory showed it was
"as clean as a pin" and suffered no damage during the launch.  </TEXT>
