   Two cosmonauts spent more than four hours outside
the Mir orbital platform Thursday to replace a faulty component on
an X-ray telescope, a task they failed to accomplish earlier this
year, Tass reported.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov used new tools recently brought
to their space station by a Progress cargo rocket to remove a
detector that had been developed by British and Dutch scientists
for the telescope, the official news agency said.
   Components of the unit melted because of exposure to cosmic
radiation, Radio Moscow reported. Tass said Titov and Manarov
replaced the part with an ``upgraded detector'' that would help
prolong the life of the telescope.
   On June 30, Titov and Manarov tried unsuccessfully to replace
the damaged unit of the telescope, which is mounted on an
observatory module called Kvant attached to the Mir. But the
cosmonauts at that time couldn't unfasten the clasp holding the
detector to the telescope.
   In Thursday's spacewalk, which lasted four hours and 12 minutes,
Titov and Manarov wore new spacesuits that Tass said free
cosmonauts from the need to remain tethered to their spacecraft.
   Tass said, however, that the two men did remain linked to the
Mir because they had to repair the telescope before testing out the
suits.
   The new suits also are equipped with new life support systems,
and the wearer communicates by radio, Tass said.
   While outside the Mir, they also installed a fastener near the
airlock that will be used in a joint Soviet-French mission
scheduled for next month, Tass said. It said the fastener would be
used during a Soviet-French spacewalk, apparently to keep the
cosmonaits tethered to the Mir.
   Titov and Manarov also fastened a radio aerial to the outside of
their spacecraft, Tass said.
   The two Soviets have been aboard Mir since December and are
scheduled to set a new space endurance record before returning to
Earth before the end of the year, Soviet officials have said.
   A third cosmonaut, Dr. Valery Polyakov, arrived aboard Mir in
September to monitor the health of Titov and Manarov. Polyakov
stayed inside the station Thursday to check on-board systems, Tass
said.
   The Mir was launched Feb. 20, 1986, and the Kvant orbiting
observatory was attached to it in early 1987.
