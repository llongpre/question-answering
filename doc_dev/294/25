   Two Soviet cosmonauts returned safely to Earth
today, ending a six-month mission during which they grew
million-dollar crystals for industry and survived a near-fatal
space walk trying to repair damage on their capsule.
   The Soyuz TM-9 capsule carrying cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and
Alexander Balandin landed near the town on Arkalyk on the Central
Asian steppes, the official Tass news agency reported.
   The landing, one minute ahead of schedule, was not shown live on
Soviet television, but at the midday news showed pictures of the
cosmonauts waving goodbye to their replacement crew aboard the
orbiting Mir space station.
   Solovyev and Balandin were launched into space Feb. 11 in what
was billed as the first manned mission in the 33-year history of
the Soviet space program to turn a multimillion-dollar profit.
   Their hundreds of experiments included photographing 8.4 million
square miles of the Earth's surface and growing 23 pure crystals
for use in semiconductors and computer chips.
   Each crystal is worth about $1 million, Tass said.
   The cosmonauts also made two space walks last month, the first
to repair damage caused to the spacecraft on takeoff.
   On July 17, they spent seven hours repairing torn thermal
insulation surrounding the Soyuz capsule which would bring them
back to Earth. The repairs took longer than expected and Soviet
media reported the two cosmonauts could have died because their
oxygen was running so low.
   Their spacesuits soaked with perspiration from the exertion,
they were forced to leave the capsule's re-entry hatch slightly
ajar and return to the space station through an emergency porthole.
They left behind handrails attached to the exterior of the capsule.
   A second, shorter, space walk on July 26 was needed to close the
hatch and retrieve the handrails.
   Tass quoted ground control officials as saying Solovyev and
Balandin had opened the hatch before the airlock was completely
depressurized and it swung outward with such force that a key joint
was damaged.
   It was the latest in a series of problems for the Soviet manned
space program, which for decades had been a source of intense
national pride.
   For the past two years, the program has been plagued by docking
equipment malfunctions, human error and budget cuts.
   The replacement crew of Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov
docked with the Mir on Friday, two days after blasting off from the
Baikanor Space Center in Kazakhstan. They will remain in space
until Dec. 10, conducting an estimated 250 experiments, including
the production of more crystals.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressure has grown on the
space program to prove its worth in a shortage-plagued society.
Some Soviet lawmakers have raised the once taboo topic of cutting
the space budget since many Soviet people don't have decent housing
or enough to eat.
   Manakov and Strekalov will return to Earth with a paying
customer, a Japanese cosmonaut who will have been brought to Mir on
Dec. 2 by their replacement crew.
   Two employees of the Tokyo Broadcasting System are vying for the
seat: television camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi and former Washington
bureau chief Toyhiro Akiyama.
   Future flights in 1992 will carry British, Austrian, West
German, French and Spanish passengers.
