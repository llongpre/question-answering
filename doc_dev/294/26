   Two cosmonauts orbited the
Earth today and prepared to climb aboard the space station Mir after
a four-month break in the Soviet manned space program forced by
failures and cost disputes.
   Commander Alexander S. Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A.
Serebrov rode a trail of orange flame into a star-filled night sky
early today aboard a rocket emblazoned with advertising.
   Scientists at Baikonur Cosmodrome applauded when their Soyuz TM-8
capsule reached orbit nine minutes later, and official reports said
all was well with the crew. The capsule dropped two booster rockets,
one carrying a 150-foot-high ad for an Italian insurance company.
   The capsule is to dock Friday with Mir space station, which was
unmanned at the end of April because of criticism of the cost of the
space program and because two new modules were not ready.
   The government newspaper Izvestia today said the new modules will
add 60 square yards to the cramped living area in space, ``and more
important, sharply increase the research capabilities of Mir.''
   ``As a whole, the crew is getting the possibility of carrying out
on a contemporary level, work in the fields of geophysics,
astrophysics, technology and biology,'' Izvestia said.
   Officials said the new modules are nearly finished and the two
cosmonauts will attach them in October and February, before they are
replaced in March. Mir already is joined with Kvant, an astrophysics
laboratory.
   The first new module features a shower and sink, airlock for
spacewalks and incubator in which Japanese quail eggs will be
hatched to study the effects of weightlessness on heredity. The
second has a telescopic camera for studying the stars, a docking
port for the Buran shuttle and equipment to grow vegetables.
   Tass, in another effort to boost the space program, today
reported space research has brought $19 billion in profits through
improved weather forecasting, communications, navigation and
transport rescue.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov have a busy schedule during their
six-month mission, which also is an important public relations
exercise.
   Soviet officials have stressed such space flights can yield
practical dividends, and pounded home the theme in the final hours
before liftoff.
   To help their space program pay more of its own way, they even
allowed advertising.
   One of three stages of the 150-foot booster rocket, painted
orange, carried an ad for the Italian company Generali. Others, for
a Soviet electronics company and ``New Dawn'' perfume, were
displayed on a side of the launch pad and in a room where the
cosmonauts met reporters Monday night.
   Mir was unexpectedly vacated in April because two add-on modules
were not ready and the Kremlin did not want to keep a crew aboard
while legislators and ordinary people were demanding more spending
at home.
   ``If we had colossal sums, we could have had the two modules on
time, but we have limited resources like everyone else,'' Lt. Gen.
Vladimir A. Shatalov, head of cosmonaut training, told The
Associated Press.
   Leaving the Mir unoccupied for only the second time since its
February 1986 launch showed a new sensitivity to public opinion by
the Soviet space bureaucracy.
   Gorbachev's political reforms have given space officials
something in common with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration: opposition from a skeptical public and legislators
trying to trim a budget deficit of $192 billion.
   Space officials invited reporters from all 15 Soviet republics
and several Western countries to watch the blastoff at the huge
Baikonur Cosmodrome, 1,560 miles southeast of Moscow in Kazakhstan.
   They also showed off the new space shuttle Buran and its ground
facilities.
   In a scene unlikely at NASA's Cape Canaveral, journalists were
even allowed on a flatbed railroad car that carried the 310-ton
capsule and booster assembly to the launch pad at dawn Monday.
   Chief engineer Yuri P. Semenov said Moscow spent $2 billion on
its civilian space program last year and the TM-8 mission cost
$138.8.
   He estimated potential economic benefits from the flight, such as
discovering mineral deposits using Mir's remote sensing equipment,
at $132 million.
