   Two cosmonauts ended a 22-week mission Monday that
included the first American experiment aboard the space station
Mir, floating out of the clear blue sky onto the glistening snow of
the Kazakhstan steppe.
   State-run television broadcast a recording of the descent module
of a Soyuz TM-8 capsule, its white parachute casting a shadow in
the vast snowy expanse.
   Mission commander Alexander S. Viktorenko and flight engineer
Alexander A. Serebrov touched down near Arkalyk in Kazakhstan
republic, 1,080 miles southeast of Moscow, the Tass news agency
said.
   Viktorenko, 42, and his 45-year-old crewmate were reported in
good health, Tass said.
   The TV report showed the cosmonauts smiling as they sat covered
with blankets in the minus 26-degree Fahrenheit temperatures at the
remote landing site. They sipped hot drinks as well as champagne on
a plane flight later Monday to Star City, the cosmonaut training
center near Moscow.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov blasted off Sept. 5 on a mission to Mir
that featured dozens of scientific experiments and the successful
testing of a ``space motorcycle,'' a one-man vehicle designed for
repairing satellites, servicing the Buran space shuttle, and
rescuing cosmonauts in distress. They tested the motorcycle during
two of five spacewalks.
   A replacement crew, Anatoly Solovyov and Alexander Balandin,
flew to the space platform Feb. 11 and will remain aboard for about
six months to continue the experiments.
   Among the 200 pounds of scientific cargo Viktorenko and Serebrov
brought back were protein crystals exposed to weightlessness in an
American experiment created by Payload Systems Inc. The company was
the first authorized by the U.S. Commerce Department to fly
experiments aboard the Soviet space station.
   The crystals, brought to space Dec. 20, will be shipped to the
United States and analyzed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory
next month, according to Payload officials.
   Other research completed by the returning cosmonauts included
experiments in geophysics, astrophysics, medical biology and
biotechnology, Tass said.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov were the fifth crew to live for an
extended period aboard Mir, the primary building block of the
Soviet orbital station launched in February 1986.
   ``During their 166-day stay in weightlessness, the crew
underwent regular medical checkups, providing new data about man's
working abilities and functional state during different stages of
the flight,'' Tass said.
   The 20-ton platform, designed to be permanently manned, remained
empty for four months in 1989 to cut costs and to give Soviet
scientists a chance to prepare two add-on modules for Mir.
   One of the modules, the Kvant-2 astrophysics laboratory, was
activated and successfully tested by the two cosmonauts, Tass said.
