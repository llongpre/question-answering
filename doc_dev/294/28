<LEADPARA>  Blustery winds prevented NASA from landing the space shuttle Atlantis in
California today, and the astronauts were ordered to remain in space an extra
day.;    Mission Control first delayed the landing by 1 1/2 hours in hopes the
winds would subside. But they didn't, and flight directors decreed a Thursday
morning touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I hope you don't mind if we ask you to stay up another day but we're going
to give up on today," Mission Control's Brian Duffy told the crew.;    "We
understand, and I think that's a good decision Brian. Thanks a lot," replied
Steve Nagel, mission commander.;    The astronauts have enough supplies on
board to stay up at least through Friday. High winds were expected again
Thursday at Edwards, and the weather did not look favorable at the Kennedy
Space Center backup site in Florida. Kennedy had not been considered for
today.;    Crosswinds had exceeded NASA's limit of 17.3 mph by nearly double
most of the morning in California.;    NASA previously has had to delay a
shuttle landing for weather reasons, and a wave-off has almost become
routine.;    This morning, NASA re-established contact with a satellite used
to communicate with the shuttle. The space agency lost touch with the
satellite late Tuesday and had to switch to ground stations.;    Atlantis'
five astronauts accomplished their primary task on Sunday, releasing the
17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory. It will circle the Earth for more than two years
in search of gamma rays, the most intense radiation in the universe.;    The
crew also undertook the first American spacewalks in five years -- one an
emergency mission to fix a stuck antenna on the $617 million observatory, the
other to lay groundwork for a $30 billion space station NASA hopes to start
building in 1995.;    On Tuesday, Mission commander Steven Nagel guided
Atlantis to within nine miles of the observatory, after a chase that started
from 95 miles away. After closing in on its quarry, the shuttle zig-zagged
behind it for several hours.;    Nagel used star trackers instead of the more
accurate and sophisticated radar to follow the observatory 280 miles above
Earth. The star-tracking technique would be vital in case radar failed.;   
The satellite trouble today involved a satellite that covers Earth's Eastern
Hemisphere. It relays video and voice signals and other data to the shuttle
and made ground stations obsolete. It was those ground stations that NASA
activated.  </TEXT>
