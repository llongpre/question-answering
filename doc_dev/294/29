   A Soviet cosmonaut took a spin in space Thursday
on a special motorcycle designed for rescuing spacemen, and
officials said the vehicle's maiden journey outside the orbiting
station Mir was a success.
   Flight engineer Alexander A. Serebrov rode the cycle as far as
30 yards away from the giant station, while mission commander
Alexander S. Viktorenko stayed at Mir's exit hatch and monitored
the cycle's operations.
   Soviet TV interrupted its regular programs several times during
the day for special coverage of the five-hour spacewalk. Live
pictures showed Serebrov, 45, attached to a tether anchored on Mir
as he prepared to ride the cycle.
   A taped report showed the cosmonaut, with his left side in the
sun and right in shadow, slowly riding away from Mir, his image
growing smaller.
   A correspondent emphasized the drama of floating in space while
connected to Mir only by a rope. He told viewers in the nighttime
newscast ``Vremya'' it was ``risky and dangerous work.''
   But Tass said the results of the 30-yard test ride and three
five-yard trips were good. ``Its easy operation and good
maneuverability were confirmed,'' the news agency said. Further
tests are planned Monday.
   It's not much of a motorcycle by Earth standards; it actually
looks more like a floating armchair, weighing 485 pounds with 32
motors.
   The cycle is designed for repairing satellites and rescuing
spacemen in distress. It can rotate and move to a maximum distance
of 50 yards away from Mir.
   The device, formally known as the Cosmonaut Movement System, is
similar to the Manned Maneuvering Unit that U.S. space shuttle
astronauts have used, Soviet officials say.
   The cycle was delivered to Mir on Dec. 6, after two delays. It
originally was scheduled to blast off last April but it wasn't
ready, and a second launching planned for September was scrapped
because of problems with its electronic docking system.
   The 20-ton Mir was designed to be permanently manned, and was
host to a record yearlong flight by two cosmonauts in 1988. But it
was unexpectedly mothballed in April because the module and another
add-on were not ready and keeping a crew aboard would have cost
money when legislators and ordinary Soviets were demanding that
space rubles be spent on Earth.
   The four-month vacancy was only the second time since Mir was
launched in February 1986 that it was unmanned.
   Mir already is joined with Kvant, an astrophysics laboratory.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov have been aboard Mir since September and
are scheduled to be replaced later this month by another crew.
