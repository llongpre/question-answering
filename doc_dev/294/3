<HEAD>Cosmonauts Fail To Repair Broken Hatch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soviet cosmonauts, working in open space for
nearly four hours, failed today in an attempt to repair a
malfunctioning hatch aboard the Mir space station, the official
Tass news agency said.
   Cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov, who have been
in space for nearly three months, left the spacecraft at 45 minutes
past midnight to work on the door, which failed to close properly
during a spacewalk in July.
   ``They did not manage to correct the hatch malfunction,'' Tass
said.
   The malfunctioning hatch is on Kvant-2, a module containing
photographic and technical equipment attached to the Mir space
station.
   During a spacewalk in July, Mir's previous tenants, Anatoly
Solovyov and Alexander Balandin, apparently were unable to close
the hatch after they entered the airlock, and had to enter the
spacecraft through another port, officials said at the time.
   They were reported by Soviet to have come dangerously close to
running out of oxygen.
   Tass said that today's malfunction presented no danger to
Manakov and Strekalov.
   ``This was just ordinary maintainance work in space, not some
extraordinary situation,'' Tass quoted Mission Control specialists
as saying.
   Today's spacewalk had originally been scheduled for Oct. 19, but
was postponed after Strekalov caught a cold while working out on an
on-board running track.
   The Soviet Union's manned space program, which for decades has
been a source of national pride, has been plagued in the past two
years by docking equipment failures, mistakes by cosmonauts and
budget cuts.
