   Three Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth today
from the Mir space station, leaving no one aboard the orbiting
craft until at least August, the official news agency Tass said.
   This is only the second time the space station has been left
unattended since it was launched in February 1986. Mir was unmanned
from July 1986 to February 1987 while the Soviets prepared the
station for constant occupation.
   Officials said leaving the Mir unmanned will save money at a
time when the Soviet Union faces a $160 billion budget deficit and
will give experts a chance to review scientific data already
collected.
   Meanwhile, other segments of the Soviet space program are
continuing. Tass announced today that a Photon rocket had been
launched Wednesday.
   ``The program of the 16-day flight includes experiments to
produce semiconductor materials with improved qualities and
extra-pure biologically active preparations in micro-gravity,''
Tass said.
   The Soyuz TM-7 carrying the three cosmonauts from the Mir
touched down in Soviet Central Asia at 6:59 a.m., Tass reported.
The capsule carrying Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and Valery
Polyakov landed 90 miles northeast of Dzheskazgan.
   The cosmonauts, apparently suffering no ill-effects from their
extended space flight, were to be taken by helicopter to a nearby
town to meet with their families, Radio Moscow said.
   Volkov and Krikalev had been in space for five months while
Polyakov, who remained on board after orbiting with a Soviet-Afghan
team, had been aboard Mir for eight months.
   A replacement crew was originally due to arrive at the Mir on
April 19, but Tass said ``a delay with the preparation'' of two new
modules forced a change in plans.
   The next crew due to take up residence in Mir in mid-August will
bring with it two modules containing a space chicken farm and
equipment for the production of single-crystal semiconductor
materials, Tass said.
   The agency said there would be ``a biological complex for
mastering the technology of growing poultry in zero gravity.''
   The new crew members, Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander
Balandin, are expected to remain on board six months.
   One of the new modules will contain an airlock to permit
cosmonauts to exit the craft while in orbit, and a maneuvering unit
for spacewalks, Tass said.
   Deputy flight director Viktor Blagov said last week that the new
modules, which would double the station's weight to 100 tons, would
be attached to the Mir by the end of the year. He said they also
will bring on board a space bicycle, a solar battery and an East
German optical experiment.
   In September, an Afghan and a Soviet cosmonaut were forced to
postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule for a day because
of equipment and crew errors. They touched down safely a day late
but were running dangerously low on food and air.
   In December, two Soviet cosmonauts returned from the Mir after
breaking the record for the longest time in space after a year-long
stay.
