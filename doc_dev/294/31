   In a cost-cutting move, the Soviets are bringing
their cosmonauts home from their space station Mir next week and
leaving it unmanned until August, the station's deputy flight
director says.
   Viktor D. Blagov said no technical problems had cropped up in
the 3-year-old orbiting complex that is the showcase of the Soviet
space program.
   His comments Tuesday came a day after the magazine Aviation Week
and Space Technology reported in the United States that Mir had
developed a serious electrical power problem.
   Mir's solar batteries, Blagov said, were experiencing some power
loss but that it was within expected levels and was not causing any
problem.
   Blagov said plans to keep Soviets aboard the station
continuously were abandoned for several reasons.
   ``By this action, we are of course economizing some sum which
can be used for other purposes,'' he said by telephone from the
Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad, north of Moscow.
   He did not identify the other purposes, but the public has
called for the untold millions of rubles spent on space to be
diverted toward ending chronic shortages of consumer goods and food.
   Blagov said Soviet scientists were swamped analyzing information
gathered from Mir, which was launched Feb. 20, 1986. They now must
pause to review ``what we have accomplished and decide what's
next.''
   Tentative plans call for a module the same size as Mir to be
attached to the station at year's end, and until then there is no
need for a crew, Blagov said. A launching of a replacement crew
originally scheduled for today has been canceled.
   Cosmonauts Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov
are to mothball the Mir and return to Earth on April 27. A new crew
will be sent up in mid-August to prepare for the attaching the new
module, Blagov said.
   The attachment contains a space bicycle for cosmonauts, a solar
battery to supplement that of the Mir, an East German optical
experiment and an airlock through which cosmonauts can pass to take
spacewalks.
   One module, a space laboratory, was attached to Mir in April
1987 and three others are planned, including one to be put up at
the end of this year or early next year in which crystals will be
grown for semiconductors, electronic parts used in computers and
other devices, Blagov said.
   One reason for putting Mir on automatic mode is to give a rest
to its support staff at mission control and tracking stations that
have been working continuously for three years, Blagov said.
   ``People are tired. They haven't had vacations. We owe them
this,'' he said.
   Officials have said a ground controller sent an erroneous
command to an unmanned Mars probe, Phobos I, in September, leaving
it useless. A sister ship, Phobos II, was lost for still
undetermined reasons last month.
   Blagov said Mir uses different controllers than those who worked
on Phobos, but indicated all are susceptible to fatigue.
   ``Tiredness can lead to an increase in mistakes, and a break
gives a positive effect to a person's work,'' Blagov said.
   During the three-month break, he said, scientists will continue
to gather data from automatic Mir instruments studying a supernova,
photographing the ocean shelf and monitoring meteorites.
   Engineers are boosting the Mir to a higher orbit to keep its
orbit from decaying, Blagov said.
   In 1974, the vacant American Skylab 4 space station fell into
the Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated upon re-entry.
