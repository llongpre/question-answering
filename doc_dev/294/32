   Here are brief sketches of the five
Discovery crew members:
   Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver is making his second trip into
space as commander of Discovery on its mission to deploy the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   Shriver heads a crew of space veterans on the flight. The last
time the National Aeronautics and Space Administration flew a crew
of shuttle veterans was on the first post-Challenger flight, in the
fall of 1988.
   As commander, Shriver is responsible for guiding the shuttle
back to the telescope should a problem occur after it is put in
orbit. Other crew members then would spacewalk to fix the telescope.
   The 45-year-old astronaut first flew into space as pilot of
NASA's first secret shuttle mission for the Pentagon. That January
1985 flight lasted three days.
   The excitement surrounding the long-awaited mission continued to
mount as the launch day neared, Shriver said in a recent interview
at the Johnson Space Center.
   ``This is a major milestone,'' he said.
   ``I think they're (scientists using Hubble) going to make some
discoveries and answer some questions we've got now and probably
raise a lot more than we know about right now.''
   Shriver was born in Jefferson, Iowa, and grew up in Paton, Iowa,
where his parents still live. He graduated from Paton Consolidated
High School.
   He graduated from the Air Force Academy with a bachelor's degree
in aeronautical engineering. He earned a master's degree in
astronautical engineering from Purdue University.
   He attended the Air Force test pilot school at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., and worked on development test and evaluation of the
F-15 fighter aircraft. In 1978, he was selected for astronaut
training.
   He and his wife, Susan, have four children.

   Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., pilot of Discovery, says he
is awed at the prospect of helping deploy a telescope so important
to scientists and the study of the universe.
   ``There's a lot of sentimental attachment to this thing for
me,'' Bolden, a veteran of one previous shuttle mission, said in a
recent interview.
   Bolden noted that although the five Discovery astronauts
actually will put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit, thousands of
people have worked on the project.
   ``I can't even begin to imagine how good we're going to feel''
when its deployed.
   Bolden, a Vietnam combat veteran, insists he has no unique
skills over other NASA pilots that earned him a seat on the
celebrated flight.
   ``I'm just lucky and thankful to be here,'' Bolden said.
   ``From my standpoint, there's nothing special that I bring other
than my own unique personality, and the ability not to be quite as
serious as you could possibly get on a flight of this magnitude.''
   Bolden, 43, was born in Columbia, S.C., where he graduated from
C.A. Johnson High School.
   He received a bachelor's degree in electrical science from the
U.S. Naval Academy and a master's in systems management from the
University of Southern California. He also is a graduate of the
Navy's test pilot school at Patuxent River, Md.
   While in Southeast Asia, Bolden flew more than 100 missions as
an A-6 attack plane pilot.
   Bolden was selected for astronaut training in 1980. He was a
pilot on his first trip into space _ a January 1986 mission that
was the last shuttle to fly before Challenger exploded shortly
after liftoff.
   He and his wife, Alexis, have two children.

   Mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use Discovery's 50-foot
robot arm to hoist the Hubble Space Telescope out of the cargo bay
and place it in space.
   As an astrophysicist, Hawley has a special interest in the
telescope. He even went to graduate school with some of the
scientists who will use Hubble once it is in orbit.
   ``It's unquestionably a major step,'' the 38-year-old astronaut
said.
   ``It's not unfair, I think, to speculate that the kind of things
the Hubble telescope may see will be revolutionary in terms of what
we know about the universe.''
   ``We know a lot now, we think,'' he said. ``There are some very
important questions, however, that just have been beyond our grasp
because'' scientists have not been able to see distant areas
clearly.
   Hawley, one of three mission specialists on Discovery, also is
the flight engineer _ the crew member who sits on the flight deck
during ascent and landing to assist the commander and pilot.
   Hawley first flew on a seven-day mission in 1984 in which three
satellites were deployed. His current crew member, Charles Bolden,
also was on board Hawley's second mission, a January 1986 flight
that was the last to fly before the Challenger explosion.
   He was born in Ottawa, Kan., and grew up in Salina, Kan., where
he graduated from Salina High School.
   Hawley received a bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy
from the University of Kansas and a doctorate in astronomy and
astrophysics from the University of California.
   Before he was selected for astronaut training in 1978, Hawley
was a postdoctoral research associate in Chile.
   He is married to the former Eileen Keegan.

   Mission Specialist Bruce McCandless II, a Navy captain and an
astronaut since 1966, is one of two crew members who would perform
a spacewalk should a problem occur on the Hubble Space Telescope.
   McCandless' first space flight was a February 1984 mission
aboard Challenger. During that flight, he and crew member Robert L.
Stewart pioneered the use of NASA's manned maneuvering unit _ a
backpack device that allows an astronaut walking in space to propel
himself from the shuttle.
   The 52-year-old astronaut is low key about his spacewalking
experience, saying only that ``it's very nice.''
   ``The biggest problem is you do have limited mobility,'' he said.
   McCandless was born in Boston. He moved to California and
graduated from Woodrow Wilson Senior High School in Long Beach. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, earned a master's degree in
electrical engineering from Stanford University and a master's in
business administration from the University of Houston at Clear
Lake in 1987.
   He was a naval aviator who participated in the Cuban blockade in
the 1962 missile crisis.
   McCandless was selected for astronaut training during the Gemini
program, and he was a backup pilot for the first manned Skylab
mission in 1973.
   McCandless and his wife, Bernice, have two grown children. He is
a member of the National Audubon Society and once was president of
the Houston Audubon Society.

   Mission Specialist Kathryn D. Sullivan is the second crew member
designated to walk in space if necessary during the Discovery
mission.
   Sullivan was the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk as she
and fellow crewman David Leetsma demonstrated satellite refueling
techniques in space in 1984. It was her first trip into space.
   The 38-year-old astronaut said she enjoyed her spacewalk, but
she would prefer a problem-free mission to another opportunity to
spacewalk.
   ``I'm there, I'm ready,'' Sullivan said. ``I'm the center
fielder who moves over to cover the right fielder.''
   Sullivan was born in Paterson, N.J. She grew up in Woodland
Hills, Calif., where she graduated from Taft High School. She
earned a bachelor's degree in earth sciences from the University of
California, Santa Cruz, and a doctorate in geology from Dalhousie
University in Halifx, Nova Scotia.
   Before joining NASA in 1978, she concentrated on academic study
and research. Since she came to NASA, her research interests have
included planetary geology.
   In 1985, she became an adjunct professor of geology at Rice
University in Houston.
   Sullivan is a private pilot, rated in powered and glider
aircraft. She is single.
