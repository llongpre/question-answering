   The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is looking for a kind of radar that can spot orbiting
debris as small as a dime which someday could pose a hazard to its
planned space station.
   The space agency has access to space debris reports from the Air
Force, but it says information is still ``extremely limited about
the number and size of small debris pieces at the operational
altitude range of the space station.''
   The station will operate 180 to 360 miles above Earth.
   NASA needs radar that can see debris as small as one centimeter
in diameter, compared with the 10-centimeter capability of current
systems. The new equipment also would need to calculate the altitude
of the objects.
   A request issued this week for proposals specifies that the new
system must be available by October 1991. The space station, named
Freedom, is scheduled to be in orbit in 1996.
   As of Jan. 11, the Air Force was tracking 7,087 pieces of space
junk, 3,142 put into orbit by the United States and 3,302 left
behind by Soviet spacecraft.
   Space junk has included items such as screws 1@8-inch in
diameter missing after a 1984 space shuttle mission, a thermal glove
that floated out of Gemini 4 in 1965, and a screwdriver dropped by a
spacewalking astronaut aboard the Soviet Mir space station.
   ``Even the smallest pieces of orbital debris pose a potential
hazard'' to the space station, NASA said. ``It is important that the
pressurized modules of Freedom be built to withstand as much orbital
debris damage as possible.''
   The station is planned to remain in Earth orbit for up to 30
years.
