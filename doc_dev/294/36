   The new crew on the Soviet space station Mir began
its first full day of work aboard the complex Saturday, focusing on
experiments to create pure ``crystals'' for use in semiconductors,
Tass said.
   Cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov conducted joint
experiments with the outgoing crew, Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander
Balandin, the official news agency reported.
   Solovyev and Balandin are scheduled to return to Earth on
Thursday. Manakov and Strekalov docked their Soyuz TM-10 capsule
with the space station Friday, two days after lifting off from the
Baikonur Space Center in Soviet Central Asia.
   The cosmonauts have turned on a ``furnace'' to melt materials to
produce the pure crystals, Tass said.
   Solovyev and Balandin have been producing the crystals in the
special ``Krystall'' module docked to the Mir. Since they arrived
in February, they produced 23 pure crystals, which Tass said were
worth about $1 million each.
   The news agency said Friday that Manakov and Strekalov will
engage in ``pilot commercial production'' of these crystals.
   The Soviet Union is focusing on the production of these
materials to make its space program profitable. It expects the
specialized manufacturing to bring in more than $40 million.
   The Soyuz TM-10 capsule that brought Manakov and Strekalov to
the Mir had other passengers aboard: five Japanese quail. Tass did
not specify what experiments were in store for the fowl.
   In December, the Soviets will launch an eight-day mission to the
Mir that includes a Japanese cosmonaut.
   The cosmonauts also have begun an experiment to produce cellular
cultures in zero gravity for use by pharmaceutical concerns, the
news agency said.
   Radio Moscow said Manakov, the flight's commander who is on his
first space mission, and Strekalov, on his fourth, were adjusting
well to zero gravity. All four cosmonauts were reported in good
health.
   Before they return to Earth following their six months in
weightlessness, Solovyev and Balandin will undergo physical
exercises in a special ``pneumatic vacuum suit'' that simulates
gravity, Tass said.
