   After months of delay, the Soviet Union on Sunday
launched an attachment for its orbiting space station Mir that
features a ``space motorcycle'' and an experiment with Japanese
quail eggs.
   However, the official Tass news agency rapidly reported
technical problems with the Kvant-2 module, saying one of the two
panels of its solar battery did not open fully, and that scientists
considered what to do next.
   Soviet television broadcast live the nighttime launch of the
Proton booster rocket carrying the module from the sprawling
Baikonur Cosmodrome, 1,560 miles southeast of Moscow in the desert
steppe of Kazakhstan.
   The Kvant-2 features a shower and sink, an airlock for
spacewalks and an incubator in which Japanese quail eggs are to be
hatched to study the effects of weightlessness on heredity. Also
aboard the module is a ``space motorcycle,'' which looks more like
a floating armchair.
   After the module docks with Mir on Dec. 2, mission commander
Alexander S. Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A. Serebrov will
test the device outside. It is designed for repairing satellites
and rescuing cosmonauts in distress.
   Tass said the two cosmonauts, who blasted off Sept. 5, are
``impatiently waiting for the module'' because its launch had been
delayed twice. It was originally scheduled to blast off in April,
but it wasn't ready then, and a second launching planned for
mid-September was scrapped because of problems with its electronic
docking system.
   Exactly what effect on the mission the non-deployment of one of
the solar battery panels could have was not spelled out by Tass.
   ``The data obtained (from telemetry) are now being analyzed,''
it said. ``A decision will be taken on the results of this
analysis.''
   It was the latest snafu in the Soviet space program. Two twin
multimillion-dollr unmanned probes to Mars were lost in flight last
year, and in the past year almost every manned mission has had
technical problems on landing.
   The 20-ton Mir was designed to be permanently manned, and it was
the site of a record yearlong flight by two cosmonauts last year.
   But it was unexpectedly mothballed in April because the Kvant-2
and another add-on were not ready and keeping a crew aboard would
have cost money when lawmakers and ordinary Soviets wanted rubles
spent on Earth.
   The four-month vacancy was only the second time since Mir was
launched in February 1986 that it was unmanned.
   Mir already is joined with the Kvant astrophysics laboratory.
   Another module, scheduled for attachment later, features a
telescopic camera for studying the stars, a docking port to link
with the space shuttle Buran, and equipment to grow vegetables and
crystals for electronics.
   Viktorenko, 42, and Serebrov, 45, are to return to Earth in
early March after a replacement crew arrives on the Mir.
