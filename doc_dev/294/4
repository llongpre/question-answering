   Two cosmonauts have repaired a balky hatch that
bedeviled them and dangerously prolonged a previous spacewalk
earlier this month, according to Soviet news reports.
   Anatoly Solovyov and Alexander Balandin also removed and stowed
handrails during the three-hour, 31-minute spacewalk Thursday.
   They had affixed the handrails to the outside of the spacecraft
during a July 17 excursion to repair torn thermal insulation on the
outside of their Soyuz TM-9 capsule, the Tass news agency said.
   Tass said ground controllers indicated that human error at the
start of the previous spacewalk caused the hatch problem. The
cosmonauts had opened the hatch before the airlock was completely
depressurized, and it swung outward with such force that a key
joint was damaged.
   Solovyev and Balandin began their spacewalk Thursday by again
trying to close the hatch, which was less than an inch ajar, Tass
said.
   They made little progress, however, and ground controllers told
them to relax and work on stowing the ladder-like handrails, which
were left behind July 17 when Solovyev and Balandin had to rush
back inside the spacecraft because their oxygen was running low.
   The handrails could have posed a problem when the capsule
separated from the Mir space station for the cosmonauts' return
voyage home.
   Tass said ground controllers studied a televised picture of the
hatch and officials at the Soviet Mission Control Center in
Kaliningrad, outside Moscow, recommended how to repair the joint.
Tass said the cosmonauts then were able to close the hatch
completely.
   They pressurized the airlock and removed their space suits, Tass
said.
   The evening television newscast ``Vremya'' reported that ground
controllers would be monitoring the pressure in the airlock to make
sure the outside hatch had sealed properly.
   The balky hatch was the latest in a series of problems to
trouble the cosmonauts' six-month mission.
   Tass focused on its accomplishments: completing 506 of 520
scientific experiments, photographing 8.4 million square miles of
the Earth's surface, and ``growing'' 23 crystals in the weightless
environment of space. The report said each crystal was worth $1
million.
   The cosmonauts, who have been in space since Feb. 11, are
scheduled to return home on Aug. 9. A replacement crew is to be
launched Aug. 1.
