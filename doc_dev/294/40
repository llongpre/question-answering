   Space shuttle Columbia's flight
next month to study the cosmos may be overshadowed by the Hubble
Space Telescope's historic journey aboard Discovery, but it will
mark a first for glasnost.
   Columbia's astronauts plan to talk via ham radio to two
cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station Mir. It's believed that
will be the first time an American and Soviet spacecraft have
exchanged direct radio communication, said Ronald A. Parise, a
payload specialist who came up with the idea.
   Columbia's commander, Vance Brand, said he doesn't know yet what
he will say during the brief conversation. But he imagines it will
be rather ordinary chitchat free of political overtones.
   ``I think basically we'll just say, ``Hi. What are you doing
over there? What sort of experiments are you working now. What do
you expect to learn? How's your food?' '' he said during an
interview Friday at Johnson Space Center.
   Brand wants to converse with the cosmonauts as much as possible
in Russian. He was part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975 in
which the crews of the American and Soviet spacecraft docked in
space.
   Parise said he believes communications between the crews were
handled through ground controllers on that joint mission.
   Brand is NASA's oldest active astronaut, 2{ weeks shy of his
59th birthday.
   ``I'm going to be prepared to do the best I can in Russian,'' he
said. ``I'll have to drag out some books. I'm pretty rusty.''
   Parise said it's impossible to know when the precedent-setting
conversation will take place during Columbia's nine-day mission
since NASA has not yet announced a new launch date.
   In addition, Mir frequently changes orbits, making it difficult
to know when Columbia's seven astronauts will be able to make
contact with the two cosmonauts who have been on board the station
a few months, Parise said.
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off May 9 with a $100
million observatory called Astro that will measure ultraviolet
radiation from stars, galaxies and quasars. But the date was pushed
back at least a week by the delay in getting Discovery off the
ground with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most
expensive and complex payload that will orbit 380 miles above Earth
for 15 years.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday, two weeks after its
first launch attempt.
