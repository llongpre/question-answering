   The manned spacecraft Soyuz TM-10 docked with the
orbiting Mir space station on Friday, two days after it was
launched, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The docking was ``made neatly and precisely on time,'' Tass said.
   Flight commander Lt. Col. Gennady Manakov and engineer Gennady
Strekalov will spend one week working with the old crew which has
been on board since Feb. 11.
   They replace cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin,
who are scheduled to return to Earth on Aug. 9, following a mission
plagued by problems with the spacecraft's thermal insulation and a
broken hatch.
   Watching from mission control center were two employees of the
Tokyo Broadcasting system who are vying to fly into space in
December: television camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi and former
Washington bureau chief Toyohiro Akiyama.
   Manakov and Strekalov will spend 132 days in the Mir and will
conduct 250 experiments, including the growing of pure crystals to
be used as semiconductors and computer chips. They will make at
least two space walks, Tass said.
   Their craft was launched Wednesday from the Baikonur Space
Center in Soviet Central Asia.
