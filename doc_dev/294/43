<LEADPARA>  A loose seal on a cargo bay door presented an unexpected chore today for NASA
engineers on the ground, as well as the prospect of a spacewalk for two
Columbia astronauts.;    A long piece of weatherstripping came loose along the
edge of a door covering the bay during launch and landing.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NASA CONSIDERS SPACEWALK TO FIX LOOSE SEAL
ON SHUTTLE DOOR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The 60-foot-long doors must close tightly for the fiery re-entry into the
Earth's atmosphere or the shuttle could burn up. If the doors close properly,
but the loose seal causes a gap, the shuttle could be damaged.;    Engineers
have studied the problem since it was discovered shortly after Wednesday's
launch and are considering sending two of the seven astronauts on board out to
fix it.;    National Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers planned to
duplicate the problem today on the shuttle Discovery at Kennedy Space Center
in Cape Canaveral, Fla.;    "There are no real concerns that we couldn't
today, right now if we needed to, crush that seal and latch the doors down,"
NASA flight director Randy Stone said Thursday. "But it's always the better
part of valor to analyze things in their entirety.";    Several white blankets
of insulation also came loose in the payload bay, probably at the same time
the seal was loosened, in a rush of trapped cargo bay air into the vacuum of
space.;    If the crew can close the doors tight enough, a spacewalk may not
be necessary. But if need be, astronauts James Bagian and Tamara Jernigan
could take a spacewalk as early as Sunday, Stone said. They would either snap
the seal back in place or snip it off. It should take about 1 1/2 hours.;   
Bagian is part of the four-member research team conducting comprehensive
medical tests in Spacelab, a compartment the size of a small bus stored in the
bay and connected by a tunnel to the shuttle's crew compartment.;    The
astronauts worked in the lab for the third day in a row today, collecting
blood samples from each other and monitoring other bodily functions to
determine the effects of weightlessness on humans. They also moved urine
samples from a Spacelab refrigerator back into a mid-deck refrigerator that
got too warm Thursday night and had to be emptied.;    The mid-deck
refrigerator was back in order this morning, but Bagian said when he opened
the door he was greeted by "a real stench that permeates the whole vehicle."
He said that may be caused by drops of loose urine on the outside of the
sample containers.;    All the urine samples were in good condition despite
the refrigerator problem, NASA said.  </TEXT>
