   After seven years of frustrating
delay, the Hubble Space Telescope is finally tucked away aboard the
shuttle Discovery, ready to embark on its mission to scour the
outermost depths of space.
   The $1.5 billion observatory represents an astronomical advance
of astronomical proportions _ the greatest, in fact, since the
first use of a telescope by Galileo in 1609.
   ``We know a lot now, we think. Perhaps we don't know anything.
Perhaps we'll learn that,'' said astronaut-astronomer Steven A.
Hawley, part of the five-member crew that is set to launch
Discovery on Tuesday.
   Among the mysteries that Hubble might help explain are quasars,
pulsars and black holes, as well as the precise origin of the
universe and the possible existence of other solar systems and life
forms.
   But the telescope's most extraordinary find during its 15-year
odyssey likely will be one not yet envisioned, said Eric Chaisson,
senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns
Hopkins University.
   ``The history of science has shown the greatest discoveries are
those the human imagination has not even conceived,'' he said. ``We
are going to demand that the Hubble look into regions of total
darkness, to look where nobody has ever looked, hoping by design to
discover the unexpected.''
   From its perch 380 miles high, the Hubble will be free of
atmospheric distortion and therefore able to detect light of all
wavelengths, including ultraviolet. The telescope will be capable
of discerning objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best observatory on Earth.
   Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their
light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
   The universe is believed to have been created 15 billion or so
years ago by a terrific explosion known as the Big Bang. That
theory is based on the discovery by the late American astronomer
Edwin P. Hubble that the universe constantly is expanding.
   The shuttle mission that will put the observatory named for that
pioneer into orbit has been eagerly awaited by NASA and scientists
around the world for more than a decade.
   The Hubble Space Telescope originally was scheduled for launch
in 1983, five years after receiving government funding. Technical
problems postponed liftoff for several years, and the mission was
delayed to 1989 by the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Concern over Discovery's solid rocket boosters pushed the
mission back yet again to mid-April so the booster's lower right
segment could be replaced.
   Minor problems continued to crop up, such as the discovery that
several dozen midges, tiny mosquito-like insects, had invaded a
payload preparation room at the launch pad. Engineers feared the
bugs might damage the 24,250-pound, 43-foot-long telescope, and
installation was postponed while the midges were rounded up.
   Later, a broken pipe sprayed water on electrical equipment and
knocked out air conditioning. Some heat-sensitive computers were
shut down, temporarily interrupting testing of the telescope's
scientific instruments.
   ``Every new problem makes you a little uptight. But we've
survived,'' said Bill Taylor, the telescope's chief engineer.
   Until the telescope arrived at Kennedy Space Center last
October, engineers had taken advantage of the numerous delays to
upgrade the instrument and make it easier to care for in space.
   The telescope, at $1.5 billion, is the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built by NASA. An additional $500 million has been
spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts and develop
computer software to operate the instrument. The European Space
Agency is paying 15 percent of the costs.
   Discovery's five astronauts say they won't breathe easy until
the Hubble is safe in space. For scientists, the nerve-racking wait
will be longer.
   ``Their hearts are going to be beating, they're going to have
butterflies and they're not going to be happy until several weeks
after we release it and they start getting data,'' said Marine Col.
Charles F. Bolden Jr., Discovery's pilot.
   Hawley will use the shuttle's 50-foot-long robot arm to remove
the Hubble from Discovery on the second day of the five-day
mission. NASA wants to deploy the telescope as soon as possible
into the flight to minimize the risk of contaminating its 8-foot
primary optical mirror.
   ``We're taking every possible precaution to be able to back up
any potential problem that we have in deploying the telescope,''
said William Reeves, NASA's lead flight director for the mission.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan,
veteran spacewalkers, will go out to help extricate, adjust or
repair the telescope, if necessary. The cabin's pressure will be
lowered three hours into the flight and remain low for several days
to shorten the four-hour response time normally required for a
spacewalk.
   It is estimated the Hubble will cost $200 million a year to
operate and maintain in orbit.
   Within a month or two, data for test images will be sent via
satellite to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
   Six scientific committees chose 160 proposals from the world's
astronomers, including five amateurs, for the instrument's first
year of observation starting in December. Ten times more observing
time was requested than the institute was able to grant. Every
year, new proposals will be accepted.
   In 1993, a shuttle is scheduled to go up to service the
telescope and, since its orbit inevitably will decay over time,
boost it back up to a proper altitude. Further maintenance missions
will be scheduled every three years. Any emergency work would have
to be squeezed into the shuttle's already crowded flight agenda,
said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver.
   ``More than likely, you would have to dedicate a mission because
the altitudes are so high,'' Shriver said.
   Discovery's ascent to 380 miles will be the highest a shuttle
has ever gone. The astronauts will bring the telescope back if it
cannot be deployed safely. But that would be a last resort, Hawley
said.
   ``We're going to do anything we can do to leave the telescope in
orbit so that it has a chance for a mission,'' Hawley said.
