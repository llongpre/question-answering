   Chunks of shrapnel from unexplained explosions
are hurtling through space at 22,000 mph and forcing designers to
add tons of shielding to protect the proposed U.S. space station
and its crew.
   Nearly 7,100 pieces of orbiting debris are being tracked by the
U.S. Space Command and more than half came from satellites or spent
rockets that ``have blown up or broken up for unknown reasons,'' a
NASA expert says.
   More than 90 satellites to date have shattered unaccountably,
but Don Kessler, project scientist for debris studies at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he doubts the cause is
collisions with meteoroids or tests of secret anti-satellite
weapons.
   ``They are like a time bomb waiting to explode,'' Kessler said
in a telephone interview. ``These explosions have occurred
everywhere, from one day (after launch) to three years.''
   Space station planners, ``faced with a considerable design
problem,'' are adding 2,000 pounds to the shielding of each of the
six modules occupied by astronauts.
   ``The debris gets most severe at 500-600 miles,'' Kessler said,
``but usually unmanned spacecraft are at that altitude and don't
require the same level of safety as a crew.'' The space shuttle
generally operates at altitudes of 150 to 300 miles and so will the
space station.
   ``When I first started working in this area, very few people
knew how their spacecraft were breaking up, including the
designers,'' Kessler said. ``The Space Command knew they were
breaking up, but never took the time to identify why.''
   He said officials have long believed that French-made Ariane
rockets explode in space but their orbits are difficult to track
with ground radar. Two years ago, however, an Ariane was launched
into an easy-to-track orbit and, Kessler said, ``it blew up after
nine months.'' The fragments of that explosion _ probably caused by
over pressurization of gases _ number 450.
   Americans and Soviets contribute to the space junk, too. Six
U.S. Delta rocket second stages exploded, the last in 1981 _ three
years after it was launched. The cause was leakage of fuels that
burn when they combine and the problem was fixed in later models.
   Such explosions cause an expanding cloud of debris _ ``a problem
analogous to cars driving around a parking lot in random directions
_ you can get hit from any direction and the most likely direction
will be head-on,'' Kessler said.
   The $1 billion space telescope scheduled to be put into orbit
next year will operate 300 miles high. A study by the Space
Telescope Institute concluded the instrument should be designed
differently because of the debris, he said.
   Maj. Alex Mondragon of the U.S. Space Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., said 5,331 pieces of debris and 1,759 ``working
payloads'' were being tracked as of April 19. The objects ranged in
size from the Soviet Mir space station to a screwdriver dropped by
a spacewalking astronaut.
   Space shuttle Challenger returned from a mission in June 1983
with a chip in a cockpit window and chemical analysis showed the
culprit was a flake of the paint used on rockets and payloads.
   The few objects returned from space all have shown debris
damage. The Palapa and Westar satellites that were retrieved by a
space shuttle crew were pitted, but not damaged enough to keep them
from functioning. The Solar Max satellite, repaired in orbit,
showed many hits _ some penetrating an insulation blanket and
damaging the surface beneath.
   ``A 3 millimeter particle has as much kinetic energy as a
bowling ball going 60 miles an hour and if it hit an electrical
component, it would probably cause that system to cease
functioning,'' Kessler said. The average collision velocity would
be 22,000 mph, he said.
