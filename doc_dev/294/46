   Astronaut Donald E. Williams, a
decorated Navy captain who flew 330 combat missions in Vietnam, is
commanding Atlantis on its mission to deploy a nuclear-powered
probe to Jupiter.
   Williams, 47, an astronaut for 11 years, flew one previous
shuttle mission, as pilot of Discovery, in 1985.
   Williams said he looked forward to flying in space again. ``It's
been quite a long time,'' he said.
   The Lafayette, Ind., native received a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering from Purdue in 1964. He and his wife, Linda,
have two children; Jonathan, 15; and Barbara 13.
   ``The mission is a very exciting one in my mind,'' Williams
said. ``We're going to greatly increase the knowledge of humankind
... as a result of this mission.''
   Characterizing his first shuttle flight as ``one of the
highlights'' of his career, Williams added it also has been a
longtime goal to command a mission.
   Williams wasn't sure he will be ready to hang up his flight suit
after the Atlantis mission.
   ``I'd certainly like to fly again if that seems to be in the
program,'' he said.

   Navy Cmdr. Michael J. McCulley, one
of two space rookies assigned to the Atlantis mission, looked
forward to gazing down at the Earth while he was in orbit.
   McCulley, 46, the pilot of Atlantis, is making his first shuttle
mission after being an astronaut for five years.
   He was born in San Diego, Calif., but considers Livingston,
Tenn., his hometown. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees
in metallurgical engineering from Purdue University.
   His wife, Jane, is an amateur artist who helped design the
flight patch for the Atlantis crew. McCulley has five children;
Marla, 20; Marcy, 17; Cynthia, 14; Robyn, 10; and Sarah, 3.
   McCulley entered the Navy as an enlisted man and served on one
diesel and two nuclear-powered submarines. He received his
officer's commission in 1970.
   ``The thing that excites me the most (about flying in space) is
to think about looking out and being able to see a round horizon
... being able to see much of the world,'' he said.
   When NASA officials told him he would be on the Galileo mission,
McCulley said he was thrilled to be part of a project he can follow
for years.
   ``I'm so fortunate, it's incredible,'' McCulley said in a recent
interview. ``I came out of high school when I was 17 years old and
joined the Navy, and here I am, 10 or 11 promotions later, getting
ready to go fly in space. I have very few complaints about life.''

   Shannon Lucid, a mission specialist
and veteran of one previous shuttle mission, rode the shuttle into
space Wednesday to play a key role in the deployment of the Galileo
probe.
   Mrs. Lucid, 46, had the job of checking Galileo's rocket
booster. The two-stage rocket was to propel the probe out of Earth
orbit to start it on a six-year journey to Jupiter.
   The biochemist flew one previous shuttle mission in 1985.
   She was born in Shanghai, where her parents were missionaries.
Just six weeks after her birth, the family was taken prisoner by
the Japanese. A year later, they were released in a prisoner
exchange.
   She received her bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees from
the University of Oklahoma, and was selected as an astronaut in 1978
   When she was young, she wanted to be an explorer but she thought
there wouldn't be much left to explore by the time she grew up.
After reading science fiction and reports about work on a rocket,
she came to another conclusion.
   ``I was thinking, well shoot, we've got the whole universe. No
one will have it all explored by the time I grow up. So I thought
that's what I'd like to be when I grew up. Of course, the United
States didn't have a space program at that time.''
   She and her husband, Michael have three children; Kawai, 21;
Shandara, 19; and Michael, 14.

   Mission specialist Ellen S. Baker,
a physician and space rookie, was sitting alone on the middeck
during the shuttle's blastoff Wednesday.
   Once in orbit, Mrs. Baker, 36, was responsible for checking the
Galileo space probe before deployment. She and fellow astronaut
Franklin Chang-Diaz also were designated to make a spacewalk if one
was required.
   She was born in Fayetteville, N.C., but her family later moved
to New York City, where her mother, Claire Shulman, is president of
the borough of Queens. She earned a bachelor's degree in geology
from State University of New York at Buffalo and received her
doctorate in medicine from Cornell.
   She joined NASA in 1981 as a medical officer at the Johnson
Space Center.
   She said she went to NASA to be a doctor, but after three years
decided she wanted to be an astronaut. She was selected as an
astronaut in 1984.
   She and her husband, Kenneth, have a 1-year-old daughter, Karen.
   Mrs. Baker said it was difficult for her to believe she finally
would be flying in space.
   ``You work in a place so long, and the time finally arrives
...,'' she said. ``It hasn't really clicked just yet.''

   Astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, a
physicist doubling as a mission specialist and flight engineer
aboard Atlantis, has flown on one previous shuttle.
   During the shuttle's liftoff and landing, his job was to monitor
displays on the flight deck with the commander, pilot and mission
specialist Shannon Lucid.
   Chang-Diaz also was to help photograph the deployment of the
Galileo probe, and he, along with mission specialist Ellen Baker
would participate in any unscheduled spacewalk.
   Chang-Diaz, 39, a native of Costa Rica and a naturalized U.S.
citizen, received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
from the University of Connecticut and a doctorate in applied
plasma physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1977.
   Chang-Diaz, a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, became an astronaut in 1980 and made his first
shuttle flight in 1986 aboard Columbia.
   He and his wife, Peggy, have three children: Jean, 15; Sonia,
11; and Lidia, 1.
   Chang-Diaz said he also works on ways to help Latin American
countries get involved in space programs and hopes he can one day
help establish an agency in the Western Hemisphere that is similar
to the European Space Agency.
