   The solar panels on the secret spy satellite
launched by the shuttle Atlantis failed to swing open the first time
ground controllers commanded them to, and Air Force officials
briefly feared the mission might fail, an industry magazine reports.
   But, with two astronauts standing by to take a spacewalk if
necessary, a second set of radio commands freed the panels, and the
satellite was successfully deployed high over the Soviet Union,
Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology reported in its Dec. 12 issue.
   The panels are needed to absorb sunlight which powers the
satellite's batteries.
   The magazine, citing Defense Department sources, said deployment
of the $500 million Martin Marietta radar satellite took place on
the shuttle's fifth orbit, or about seven hours after it was
launched at 9:30 a.m. EST on Friday, Dec. 2.
   After the astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm to release the
satellite, they kept their spaceship close enough to watch the
deployment, and were able to visually confirm when it was fully open
to its 150-foot span.
   Had it not, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr.
William M. Shepherd were prepared to take a spacewalk to repair or
retrieve the satellite.
   The magazine said Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson first maneuvered
the shuttle to a point about 3 miles from the Lacrosse, then to
about 5 miles away, then further at 5-mile increments.
   These maneuvers were witnessed by a network of amateur
astronomers linked by computers around the world and headed by Ted
Molczan of Toronto, Canada, according to the magazine.
   It said the astronomers observed close-formation flight between
the Atlantis and the Lacrosse on their sixth and seventh orbits. By
Dec. 6, just before the shuttle returned to Earth, members of the
group in Australia observed the Lacrosse about 180 miles from
Atlantis, the magazine said.
   The mission was the third entirely classified shuttle flight, and
neither NASA nor the Air Force released any information about its
purpose. However it was widely reported _ even by the official
Soviet news agency Tass _ that the Lacrosse was being deployed to
observe Soviet and Eastern European military operations through
darkness or cloud cover.
   Such information would be valuable for verifying Soviet arms
compliance. The satellite would also serve as a ``radar eye'' for
the new B-2 stealth bomber.
