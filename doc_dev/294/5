   Two cosmonauts who walked in space to fix their
spacecraft had to use an emergency hatch to re-enter the Mir space
station when the normal hatch failed to close completely, Soviet
media reported today.
   The two, Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin, spent seven
hours outside the spacecraft Tuesday repairing thermal insulation
that had partially ripped apart and threatened to interfere with
their safe return to Earth, Tass said.
   The official news agency said the crew, after leaving the space
station, inspected the torn insulation on the Soyuz TM-9 capsule
and, ``with the help of metal clamps, fixed the two loose shield
fragments.''
   When the repair work was finished, the cosmonauts faced a new
problem: the outer door to the entrance chamber would not close,
preventing them from achieving the hermetical seal needed to open
the inner door.
   Tass said Solovyev and Balandin entered through a hatch in one
of the space station's two scientific modules. ``They sealed it
hermetically and took off their space suits,'' the news agency said.
   The entire operation took about two hours longer than scheduled,
Tass said. Ground controllers expressed confidence there would be
no problems when the two cosmonauts return to Earth on Aug. 9.
   ``According to the results we have gotten so far ... we can
almost definitely state that it (the thermal insulation problem)
will not affect the landing,'' said flight controller Vladimir A.
Solovyev in an interview from the Baikonur Space Center in Soviet
Central Asia.
   The report by the flight controller, who is a former cosmonaut,
was broadcast live Tuesday night by the evening news program Vremya.
   The program showed a fuzzy picture of the Soyuz spacecraft with
what appeared to be flapping thermal insulation. Part of the
insulation has been flapping uselessly for months. Soviet officials
extended the cosmonauts stay in space so they could make the
repairs. They had been scheduled to return July 30 after nearly six
months in space.
   The emergency repairs were the latest in a series of problems in
the Soviet Union's manned space program, which for decades has been
a source of national pride. For the past two years, the program has
been plagued by docking equipment malfunctions, cosmonaut errors
and budget cuts.
   The damage probably occurred during the Soyuz capsule's launch
Feb. 11, when a ground rescue structure apparently scratched the
thermal blanket, according to Deputy Flight Director Viktor Blagov.
   Soviet officials have minimized the danger, saying the capsule
could withstand such damage to its thermal blanket, the newspaper
Izvestia reported.
   ``No one is concerned here. It is an abnormal situation but
controllable,'' said Vsyeva Latyshev, a spokesman at the Soviet
Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad, north of Moscow. He spoke in
a telephone interview.
   But James Oberg, an American specialist on the Soviet space
program, said that although the cosmonauts managed to climb back
into Mir safely, the hatch problem could complicate future
spacewalks.
   ``The general crisis was not fully resolved,'' Oberg, author of
several books on the Soviet space program, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday from his Texas home.
