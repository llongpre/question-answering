   Czechoslovakia's transition from a communist
to private enterprise economy will be swift and thorough in order
to avoid the ``halfway'' reforms that are causing economic chaos in
the Soviet Union, the Czech finance minister said Thursday.
   ``Partial reform of a distorted economy ... is much worse than a
non-reform,'' and delays to prepare a comprehensive blueprint mean
``postponing it to eternity,'' Minister Vaclav Klaus said.
   Such a cautious approach ``leads very soon to chaotic
disintegration of the economy, as we see in the Soviet economy just
now,'' Klaus added in a speech to the World Bank's second annual
conferening the problem to see what was
wrong.
   ``Either we are getting the wrong information to make our
calculations or we are making a mistake somewhere procedurally,''
he said. ``We are just going to have to slowly and systematically
work through that before we decide what is wrong.''
   Originally, officials had said the second outage also lasted
about 45 minutes. But four hours later, the center still had not
communicated with the high gain antennas, which are the primary
communications links to relay science data to the ground during
normal operations, Elliott said. There was contact with the
telescope's low gain antennas which can be used in emergencies.
   The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was
released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
   Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud
rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.
   ``Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that
song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. ``There are a
lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and
Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.''
   ``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied
Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
   After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of
maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park''
Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
   ``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday.
   ``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work
you've done,'' replied Mission Control. ``Galileo is real proud of
you.''
   Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive
unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since
Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
   Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope
while controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md., make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to
directional commands.
   The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot
aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from
the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Data will follow in a month or two.
   If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk
to fix it.
   Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door
is opened.
   ``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive
instruments.
   On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist
it from the cargo bay.
   One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as
expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
   But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge
when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its
39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out
on the third attempt.
   By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away
from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance
call.
   Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
   The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was
dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting
atmosphere.
   Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the
beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their
light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to
determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
   The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but
was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
   Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to
land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
