   Two cosmonauts rocketed into orbit Sunday on a
mission designed to turn a profit of over $40 million, a first in
the 32-year history of the Soviet space program.
   Riding a Soyuz TM-9 capsule, flight commander Anatoly Solovyov
and engineer Alexander Balandin soared into cloud-streaked skies
over the Baikonur space complex in Soviet Kazakhstan on schedule at
9:16 a.m. Moscow time.
   The launch of the three-stage rocket, shown live on Soviet
television, was also witnessed by four U.S. astronauts flown to the
space center in Central Asia for the event.
   The American guests included Dan Brandenstein, who commanded the
11-day flight of the space shuttle Columbia in January; Ron Grabe;
Paul Weitz; and Jerry Ross.
   Solovyov and Balandin were scheduled to dock later with the
space station Mir and to relieve two fellow Soviet spacemen now
spending their sixth month in orbit. The new cosmonauts are to
spend six months in space.
   All systems were reported normal by Soviet television eight
minutes after the Soyuz capsule and booster rocket lifted off atop
a column of orange-white flames.
   The cosmonauts now aboard the Mir, Alexander Viktorenko and
Alexander Serebrov, are scheduled to return to Earth on Feb. 19.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressures have increased
on the once sacrosanct Soviet space program to prove its usefulness
to the shortage-plagued economy. Some Soviet lawmakers have even
called for funding cutbacks, saying the country can ill afford
costly space missions when it cannot supply citizens with a
reliable supply of meat and potatoes.
   The Soyuz TM-9 mission, however, is designed to to put to use
the Kristall module, described by the government newspaper Izvestia
as the first orbital factory for the full-scale manufacture of
technological and biotechnological materials in the near-weightless
conditions on Mir.
   Through use of Kristall, to be launched for linkup with Mir on
March 30, a profit of up to $41 million is expected, the official
Tass news agency said. It is the first time a profit has been part
of a manned mission in the history of the Soviet space program.
