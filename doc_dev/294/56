   Engineers managed to shift a wayward private
communications satellite out of harm's way Friday, at least
temporarily, and an aerospace company offered equipment for a
possible salvage mission by a space shuttle.
   Engineers were able to send the Intelsat VI satellite to a new,
higher orbit, where it won't be drawn back to Earth by the
thickening atmosphere.
   The satellite failed to separate from its launch vehicle, a
commercial Titan 3 rocket, after liftoff from Cape Canaveral on
Wednesday and was trapped in a useless orbit that swung within 103
miles of Earth.
   On Friday, rocket builder Martin Marietta attributed the failure
to a wiring problem in its Titan 3 launch vehicle that was
``undetected by the processes and test procedures used in
pre-launch checkout.''
   Kerry Masson, a Martin Marietta spokeswoman in Denver, said the
signal failed to make it from an onboard computer to the mechanism
that was to separate the rocket and the satellite.
   Without that separation, a motor attached to the satellite was
unable to propel the spacecraft to its duty station 22,300 miles
above Earth. When engineers finally separated the sent rockets, the
booster rocket remained with the launch vehicle and both were
expected to fall back to Earth soon.
   Intelsat, the international communications consortium which owns
the $150 million uninsured satellite, fired small onboard thrusters
and raised the satellite's orbit by nearly 60 miles. That put the
5-ton satellite out of immediate reach of the atmosphere.
   ``This is very good news,'' said Tony Trujillo, spokesman for
the 118-nation consortium. ``We feel much better about the mission
right now.''
   ``Right now, we are concentrating discussing with NASA on the
possibility of assistance,'' Trujillo said. Such assistance would
have to come from the space shuttle.
   Orbital Sciences Corp., a small Virginia aerospace company, sent
a letter to various parties, including Intelsat and NASA, offering
a newly developed rocket assembly that can be attached to a
stranded satellite in orbit.
   ``Specifically, the OSC plan is to carry a replacement perigee
motor to orbit on the shuttle, mate the motor to the satellite, and
complete the mission from orbit rather than returning the satellite
to Earth for refurbishment and relaunch,'' said the letter to NASA
administrator Richard Truly and others.
   The device, called a transfer orbit stage or TOS, is designed to
boost spacecraft from low Earth orbit to the 22,300 mile-high
altitude at which communications satellites operate. The device was
qualified for space flight only in January.
   ``We haven't proposed anything,'' said Robert Lovell, a vice
president of Orbital Sciences. But, he said, the company has talked
with colleagues about using the transfer stage if the shuttle were
made available.
   ``The TOS could be sent up in the shuttle, astronauts would
attach it to the spacecraft and send it on its way,'' Lovell said.
   Only one transfer orbit stage has been built _ the engineering
model used in qualification tests. Lovell said that's the one that
would be offered for the rescue.
   While the satellite was in a 103 mile by 218 mile orbit, NASA
said it would not consider a rescue. The low point of that orbit
brushes the upper edge of the atmosphere and the satellite was
given only a nine-day life.
   NASA has performed five spectacular space rescues, the latest
this year when it brought back the bus-size Long Duration Exposure
Facility.
   In 1984, astronauts brought back two satellites stranded in a
useless orbit because their attached rockets didn't ignite. Johnson
Space Center spokesman Kyle Herring said that mission, which
involved spacewalks, required nine months of planning.
   Asked what a rescue mission for the Intelsat satellite would
cost, Lovell said the biggest expense would be the shuttle mission.
The transfer orbit stage would require about a third of the space
in the cargo bay, he said.
   In its new orbit, 161 miles at the low point, the Intelsat
satellite can stay in space for months. Moreover, because the
satellite had enough steering fuel to last for 13 years, there is
plenty left to keep it out of the grip of the atmosphere.
   The satellite was propelled into space at a cost of about $270
million in the fourth commercial launch of a payload by a U.S.
company.
   The Intelsat VI spacecraft was intended to transmit three TV
channels and up to 120,000 telephone calls simultaneously. It was
to have eventually replaced two older satellites over the Atlantic.
