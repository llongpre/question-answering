   Mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman, a veteran of one previous
shuttle mission, said he is looking forward to working as ``a real
astronomer'' in space during the Columbia mission.
   ``We get to be astronomers. It really is a great mission,''
Hoffman said in an interview earlier this year.
   Hoffman, 46, flew on a 1985 mission during which he made an
emergency spacewalk in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue a
malfunctioning satellite.
   While his main duty during the Columbia flight is to help
operate the Astro observatory, Hoffman also is trained to perform a
spacewalk if needed during the mission.
   ``We're not planning to do it, but if it happens, we're ready,''
he said.
   Hoffman already has plans to go into space again on a shuttle
mission scheduled for September 1991.
   He grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. He earned a bachelor's in
astronomy, graduating with highest honors from Amherst College.
   Hoffman earned a doctorate in astrophysics from Harvard in 1971
and a masters' degree in materials science from Rice University in
1988.
   Before he was selected as an astronaut in 1978, Hoffman worked
on several scientific assignments involving research on X-ray data
from several satellites.
   He is married and has two children.

   Ronald A. Parise is one of two payload specialists specifically
assigned to the flight to help operate the Astro observatory.
   Parise and Samuel Durrance are the first non-space agency
shuttle passengers since the 1986 Challenger explosion. Seven
astronauts died in the explosion, including teacher Christa
McAuliffe and Hughes Aircraft engineer Gregory Jarvis.
   ``I'm ready to go. I've been ready for a long time,'' Parise
said in an interview.
   Parise has spent a decade designing and developing the
ultraviolet imaging telescope, one of the Astro instruments, and
said that 10 years of work ``seems like a long time, but it's
certainly gone fast.''
   Payload specialists are not members of NASA's astronaut corps
but undergo extensive training for a shuttle flight.
   Parise, 39, was born in Warren, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's in
physics from Youngstown State University in Ohio. He also earned a
master's and a doctorate in astronomy from the University of
Florida.
   Parise is a senior scientist in the space observatories
department at Computer Sciences Corp. in Silver Spring, Md.
   He is married and has two children.

   Samuel Durrance, the second payload specialist aboard the
flight, waited years to fly into space but was nearly scrapped from
the Columbia crew earlier this year.
   Durrance, 47, an astronomer and research scientist at Johns
Hopkins University, was cleared for flight aboard Columbia in June
following a health evaluation.
   NASA said Durrance is ``medically qualified'' to take part in
the mission, but the space agency has declined to elaborate on the
problem that almost kept him from flying.
   Durrance said he started working on the Astro project in 1982
and was finally picked to fly on a shuttle mission to operate the
observatory two years later.
   ``My feelings about the Astro are great. I've been working on it
for a long time,'' he said.
   Durrance grew up in Tampa, Fla., and earned a bachelor of
science degree and a master's in physics from California State
University. He later earned a doctorate in astrogeophysics from the
University of Colorado.
   But he hasn't always had his sights set on the stars.
   Durrance, who built race cars when he was a teen-ager, said he
didn't really become interested in the space program until the
Apollo missions. He decided to pursue a career in science, although
he didn't really aspire to become an astronaut.
   At Johns Hopkins, he is assistant project scientist for the
Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, which is part of the Astro
observatory. His main interests are in the origin and evolution of
planets.
   He is married and has two children.
