   A Soviet rocket rode a
column of fire into orbit in a picture-perfect launch Sunday,
carrying two cosmonauts and a Japanese television reporter who
became the first journalist in space.
   The liftoff - which also launched a Soviet effort to
commercialize their space program - was right on schedule, under
bright, sunny skies on the remote Central Asian steppes of
Kazakhstan.
   Journalist Toyohiro Akiyama, 48, joined Soviet cosmonauts Viktor
Afanasyev and Musa Manarov in the Soyuz TM-11 space capsule.
Akiyama was a passenger under a $12 million contract between the
Soviet Union and Japan's biggest private television company, TBS.
   Underscoring the commercial nature of the mission, the Soviet
rocket even had advertising slogans for TBS and other Japanese
companies emblazoned on its sides.
   About an hour and a half before the Soviet launch, the U.S.
space shuttle Columbia blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The
flight, NASA's sixth shuttle mission this year, carried seven
astronauts and an astronomical laboratory into space.
   With two Soviet cosmonauts already aboard the orbiting space
station Mir, the two liftoffs brought to 12 the number of people in
space, the most ever at one time. The Columbia crew hopes to
contact the Soviet crew by radio.
   The Soviet rocket's fiery blastoff shook shook a reviewing stand
about a mile away in this once-secret space installation, 1,200
miles east of Moscow.
   ``I feel fine,'' Akiyama said minutes before the 1:13 p.m. (3:13
a.m. EST) liftoff. During the eight-day mission, he will document
the experience on radio and television for TBS.
   The Japanese television company is spending $37 million on the
entire venture to mark its 40th year on the air, according to
network president Izumi Tanaka.
   More than 120 TBS reporters, cameramen and technicians scurried
about the launch control center and reviewing stand to cover the
launch, even sacrificing a remote-control camera next to the rocket
to watch the flames close-up before it burned.
   Akiyama's wife, Kyoko, called the blastoff ``beautiful,''
although she earlier said she was nervous.
   ``But when I saw their faces on the television screen, I calmed
down and felt happier,'' she said.
   Akiyama, a TBS news director who quit a four-pack-a-day
cigarette habit during the training, was asked before liftoff what
he looked forward to most on his return from the first trip into
space by a Japanese citizen.
   ``I can't wait to have a smoke,'' he said.
   Akiyama, for whom TBS bought a $2.2 million life insurance
policy, carried stationery, a picture of his family and three
Japanese good-luck charms into space.
   Tanaka, the TBS president, said the rocket ``took off just like
a train on schedule.'' He said Akiyama would receive a promotion
when he got back.
   Akiyama will return to Earth with cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and
Gennady Strekalov, the current Mir crew. They will end a four-month
stay in space and be replaced by Manarov and Afanasyev, who will
stay aboard the space station for six months.
   In addition to live broadcasts, Akiyama will photograph
environmental damage on Earth and conduct experiments on Japanese
tree frogs to see how they cope in a gravity-free environment.
   TBS also hopes to arrange a tlephone call Dec. 7 between
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the cosmonauts.
   Soviet officials and TBS executives have held out the hope that
the flight could improve ties between the two countries, which
never officially ended their World War II hostilities.
   The commercial contract boosts the Kremlin's drive to cash in on
its Soyuz space program in the face of critical economic problems
at home.
   Despite receiving about $30 million from sponsors for several
weeks of live coverage and documentaries about the space program,
TBS will not immediately turn a profit on the venture, Tanaka said.
   ``Yes, we will lose about $7.4 million, but we consider this
loss the cost of TBS' growth,'' he said.
   The mission will be the eighth to hook up with the Mir space
station since it was put into orbit in 1986.
   Although Soviet scientists and 14 foreign cosmonauts have ridden
into space aboard Soyuz capsules, Akiyama is the first
non-scientific paying passenger. Sunday's launch culminates three
years of planning between the Japanese firm and Soviet officials.
