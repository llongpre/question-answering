   Two cosmonauts took President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's drive for economic efficiency to new heights Sunday,
blasting off on the Soviet Union's first space mission designed to
turn a profit.
   Riding a Soyuz TM-9 capsule, flight commander Anatoly Solovyov,
42, and engineer Alexander Balandin, 36, soared atop a column of
orange-white flames into cloud-streaked skies over the Baikonur
space complex in Soviet Kazakhstan at 9:16 a.m.
   Their on-schedule launch was televised live, and for the first
time, four active U.S. astronauts were invited to the formerly
top-secret spaceport on the steppes of Central Asia to watch it.
They were Dan Brandenstein, head of NASA's astronaut office and
commander of the 11-day January mission of the space shuttle
Columbia, and Paul Weitz, Ron Grabe and Jerry Ross.
   The Americans' presence was additional proof of how Gorbachev's
leadership has led to more openness and a rollback of the obsessive
secrecy that once cloaked Soviet space ventures.
   Solovyov, who led a joint Soviet-Bulgarian mission in 1988, and
space rookie Balandin were to link up with the Mir orbital platform
on Tuesday. They will relieve two fellow Soviets, Alexander
Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov, who were launched Sept. 5 and
are in their sixth month in orbit.
   Under Gorbachev, pressures have increased on the country's once
sacrosanct space program to prove its usefulness to the
shortage-plagued economy. Some lawmakers have even demanded big
funding cuts, saying the nation cannot afford costly space missions
when it cannot guarantee citizens a reliable supply of meat and
potatoes.
   However, the six-month mission undertaken by Solovyov and
Balandin has been noisily billed by state-run media as a
moneymaker. The spacemen are to put to use the new Kristall module,
described by the government daily Izvestia as the first
mini-factory for the manufacture of technological and
biotechnological materials in zero-gravity conditions.
   Through use of Kristall, which is to be shot into orbit March 30
for linkup with Mir, up to $41 million of profit are forecast, the
official Tass news agency said. ``For the first time in Soviet
cosmonautics, incomes from the flight are expected to exceed by far
spending on the spaceship's launch,'' it proclaimed.
   The cosmonauts will melt crystals and exploit conditions of
weightlessness to manufacture super-pure semi-conductor materials
for science and technology, Tass said. ``Factories that placed
their orders with the cosmonauts are waiting impatiently to put
them to use,'' it added.
   Other moneymaking ventures for the cosmonauts are
bio-engineering experiments and photographing the Earth's surface.
Part of the bio-engineering program was developed with the help of
U.S. scientists, Tass said, adding it showed how superpower
cooperation in space is growing.
   While there was no way to audit the huge profits claimed for the
Soyuz TM-9 mission by Tass, the accent on profitability was in
keeping with the new realities the Soviet space program is
experiencing under Gorbachev.
   When Viktorenko and Serebrov were launched in September, their
three-stage booster rocket was festooned with an advertisement
bought by Generali, an Italian insurance company, and ads for a
Soviet electronics firm and ``New Dawn'' perfume, a Soviet scent,
were prominently displayed at the launch pad.
   Likewise, the Soviets opened up another once-secret spaceport,
Plesetsk, to foreigners in September, courting clients from West
Germany, France and other Western countries by offering cut-rate
prices to place payloads in orbit.
   However, the mission that began Sunday was the first under the
shift of Soviet space research to the ``profit-and-loss''
accounting system imposed by the Kremlin on factories and farms,
Tass said. Space missions used to be paid for from a central fund,
but the Soyuz TM-9 mission is financed by state-run enterprises and
organizations that seek some benefit from it, for example by
testing technology or conducting experiments, Tass said.
   The Soviet space shuttle Buran, launched on its maiden unmanned
mission in November 1988, has drawn the most fire from Soviet space
critics, with even Roald Z. Sagdeev, former chief of the country's
space program, calling it a multibillion-ruble boondoggle built for
no good reason.
   But even the Mir, launched in 1986 as the chief building block
of a Soviet space station, has been caught in the economy drive.
The Mir, originally designed to be permanently manned, remained
empty for four months in 1989 to cut costs and give Soviet
scientists time to prepare modules like Kristall to be launched and
bolted to it.
   Alexei Leonov, deputy chief of the cosmonauts' training center,
told Tass this saved $25 million, but admitted some people question
that sum, thus also casting doubt on how the fabulous profits for
the mission that began Sunday were figured.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov are to return to Earth Feb. 19. During
their mission on Mir, they tested a ``space motorcycle'' designed
to recover satellites or recover spacemen in distress.
