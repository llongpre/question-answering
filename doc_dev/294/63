<HEAD>Cosmonaut Says John Denver Welcome On Soviet Craft, But Must Do
Useful Work</HEAD>

   American singer John Denver is welcome to fly
aboard a Soviet spacecraft, but the cosmonauts hope he will do
something besides bring his guitar and sing.
   Cosmonaut Alexander Alexandrov, who has made two space journeys
and spent a total of 310 days in orbit, said Wednesday that it is
the practice of the Soviet Union to fly ``representatives of many
countries'' on board the Mir space station.
   That, he said, would include someone from the United States,
including Denver.
   But Alexandrov, speaking through an interpreter, added: ``The
cosmonauts, of course, are more interested that if they fly with
someone, that their colleagues have tasks or experiments. Denver
deals with problems that are not totally connected with space or
with scientific or technological problems.''
   Denver, a recording artist and movie star, announced recently
that the Soviets have said he could fly aboard a Soviet craft and
spend time on the Mir space station if he would pay a fee of $10
million and undergo training.
   Alexandrov, teamed with Apollo astronaut Russell L. Schweickart
on a book promotion tour for the Association of Space Explorers,
said Soviet cosmonauts are interested in teaching children of the
world about the importance of space flight and ``how to preserve
our Earth.''
   This educational effort could be aided, he said, by flying
journalists and teachers, ``particularly teachers,'' into space.
   ``Denver could perhaps do the same thing,'' he said.
   Schweickart said that he has been told by the Soviets that the
$10 million fee required from Denver is not unique, but is a
standard charge that the Soviets have requested from all guest
cosmonauts.
   ``It's not like they are selling a ticket for money,'' said the
U.S. astronaut.
   Schweickart and Alexandrov said the Association of Space
Explorers is an organization open to any of the more than 200 men
and women from 25 countries who have flown in space. The current
membership is 72 from 17 countries, said Schweickart.
   Alexandrov said the group feels that the spacefaring nations of
the world should prepare a craft that will be constantly poised for
the launch of a rescue mission to recover astronauts or cosmonauts
stranded in space.
   ``You can have completely unexpected and catastrophic potential
crises in space,'' said Alexandrov. ``There may be a case that in
order to save a life you would have to rescue an astronaut before
three days went by.''
   During his first term in office, President Reagan asked the
Soviet Union to participate in developing space rescue techniques
that would involve transferring of astronauts and cosmonauts from
the orbiting spacecraft of one country to that of the other. But
the offer was rejected in 1985.
   Alexandrov, however, said the cosmonauts ``definitely agree''
that there should be rescue capabilities.
   ``There ought to be systems which are always ready to deal with
this, in the USSR and maybe other countries and the (United)
States,'' he said. ``This would allow us to go more calmly about
what we are doing.''
   The book promoted by the space explorers organization is
entitled ``The Home Planet'' and is a collection of photographs
taken in space on American and Soviet spacecraft. Along with the
pictures are quotations and excerpts from essays by the astronauts
and cosmonauts.
   ``This book is written for the children of the future, so
children might understand how to develop the science and technology
of the future and how to preserve the Earth,'' said Alexandrov, who
returned to Earth last December after 160 days on the Soviet space
station, Mir _ his second flight.
   Schweickart, who was lunar module pilot on the Apollo 9 mission
which tested equipment in Earth orbit as a rehearsal for the moon
landings, said a universal space rescue capability was discussed
two weeks ago at the Association of Space Explorers fourth annual
meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria.
   He said the group urged Reagan, NASA and the Congress last year
to include a rescue proposal as a topic of last spring's
Gorbachev-Reagan summit. The cosmonauts made a similar petition to
their government.
   But Schweickart said the rescue was not discussed. He said,
however, that the NASA authorization bill this year requires the
space agency to investigate cooperation with the Soviet Union of
such steps as establishing common docking capabilities and
frequency allocations that would lead to joint rescue capability.
   ``The most important aspect is commitment to the principle,''
said Alexandrov.
