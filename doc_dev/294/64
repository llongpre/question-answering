   A congressional report warns that shuttle
flights and other space activity could become too risky within the
next 20-30 years if nations continue to litter the most traveled
paths.
   Already, the Hubble Space Telescope - which has enough problems
of its own because of faulty optics - has been given a one-in-100
chance of being severely damaged by space debris during its 17-year
lifetime, said the Office of Technology Assessment.
   `Even small debris particles can produce high levels of
damage,'' said Ray Williamson, who directed the study. ``The
average collision velocity in low earth orbit is about 10
kilometers (6.2 miles) a second.''
   At such speed, an object having one-thirty-fifth the weight of
an aspirin tablet would have the impact of a 30-06 bullet, he said.
   NASA is incorporating shielding for critical elements as it
designs the space station and is looking into possible collision
avoidance maneuvers for the shuttle, according to the OTA report.
   Don Kessler, NASA's debris expert at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, said the agency is warned about once every shuttle mission
by Air Force trackers that objects are in the path. About once
every five missions, he said - when the object is in an approaching
``box'' a mile high, a mile wide and three miles long - NASA is
advised to change course slightly.
   Such a maneuver has never been made, he said, because even
within that box the chances of a collision are estimated at one in
100,000.
   In the only documented collision, a tiny paint chip damaged the
windshield of space shuttle Challenger in 1983 to the extent that
it had to be replaced. That chip would have punctured the
pressurized suit of a spacewalking astronaut had it struck him, OTA
said.
   As of last week, the U.S. Space Command was tracking 6,645
artificial objects orbiting Earth, each larger than a softball and
weighing a total of about 4.5 million pounds. Only six percent were
operating satellites; the rest was debris and some experts think
there may be another 30,000 to 70,000 bits of junk too small to
track.
   Half the debris comes from rockets that drift in orbit after
boosting their spacecraft above the atmosphere. Other debris comes
from satellites, particulates from solid rocket motors and paint
chips that have flaked off.
   ``As you increase levels of space activity, unless we do
something to reduce the generation of debris, it will increase,''
Williamson told a news conference. He said estimates are the junk
will increase by 240 pieces a year, or more as space activities are
stepped up.
   ``That debris can collide with both active and inactive
satellites, damaging the active satellites and maybe rendering them
inoperative, and producing more debris from both types,''
Williamson said.
   Debris also is becoming a problem at the 22,300-mile altitude
where communications satellites operate.
   The report said international action will be needed to minimize
production of new debris and to cope with that already in orbit.
   It suggested boosters and spacecraft could be designed not to
explode or break up; batteries could be protected from explosion;
and spent upper stages of rockets could be removed by reducing
their altitude so atmospheric drag will bring them down.
   Although the OTA study doesn't mention it, nature is helping
remove space debris. An increase in solar activity has resulted in
the expansion of the atmosphere which, in turn, slows low-flying
objects and forces them to fall to Earth - burning up in the
process. Not long ago, the Space Command was tracking 7,200
objects.
   The Japanese and European space agencies are doing their share
to reduce debris and OTA said discussions with the Soviets have
proven fruitful.
   In the past, the Soviet Union made it a practice to fragment
certain reconnaissance satellites after their useful life,
presumably to prevent them from being recovered by the United
States. Recently, they have exploded these satellites in low orbits
so that the debris quickly enters Earth's atmosphere.
