   NASA is considering sending
astronauts to repair a stranded satellite or to bring it back to
Earth, but will meet with aerospace company officials again before
making a decision.
   ``Those are the options they're looking at, either reboost (to a
higher useful orbit) or retrieve,'' said Kyle Herring, a spokesman
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA officials met for about seven hours at Johnson Space Center
on Thursday with representatives from Intelsat, the satellite's
owner, and Hughes Aircraft Co., which built the spacecraft.
   Although no decision was made regarding a rescue attempt, NASA
officials are ``obviously showing some interest,'' Herring said.
   The uninsured $150 million communications satellite was launched
by a Titan 3 booster rocket March 14 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., but
wound up in the wrong orbit after failing to separate properly from
the second stage of the rocket.
   Intelsat engineers managed to separate the satellite and later
boost it to a higher parking orbit using computer commands.
   The Intelsat VI satellite is whirling uselessly about 276 miles
above Earth, 22,000 miles lower than it should be.
   ``They're comfortable where it is,'' at least for now, Herring
said.
   Herring said NASA and officials from the two companies discussed
the possibility of attaching a motor to the spacecraft that would
boost it to where it should be. Such an attempt would require a
spacewalk by astronauts to draw the satellite into the shuttle's
payload bay, he said.
   ``While the discussions were very preliminary, no insurmountable
technical issues were identified,'' NASA said in a statement.
   Thursday's meeting ``was devoted to fact-finding only and no
decisions were made as to whether such a mission could be
accomplished,'' the space agency said. ``Additional meetings are
being planned to further discuss aspects of the Intelsat VI status
and rescue options.''
   William Reeves, lead flight director for next month's trip by
the shuttle Discovery to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, said
there were no plans to incorporate any rescue attempt in the
five-day mission.
   Martin Marietta Corp., which launched the rocket and satellite
at a cost of $270 million, has blamed the failure on a design
error. It was Martin Marietta's second commercial launch of a
payload into orbit and the fourth by an American company.
   The Intelsat VI satellite was intended to transmit three TV
channels and up to 120,000 telephone calls simultaneously for more
than 13 years. Intelsat, a not-for-profit international consortium,
operates a global communications satellite system.
