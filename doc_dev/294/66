  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Describing an incident 
that took place after the undocking of the Soyuz TM-17 spaceship 
and the Mir space station on Friday [14 January], Aleksandr 
Serebrov told a news conference on Monday: "We circled the 
station, touched it and flew away". 
  Specialists confirmed that, indeed, the spaceship with 
Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov aboard touched the Mir 
station. However, it is too early to speak about causes and 
consequences of the incident. 
  Some experts believe that the programme of the 15th main 
expedition (Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy 
Polyakov) which relieved Tsibliev and Serebrov at the Mir 
station, will be somewhat changed. 
  Their plan of work did not provide for space walks. However, 
it will be necessary to do them now. 
  Nevertheless, according to the cosmonauts who ended their 
mission on Friday, the Mir station is in good condition. 
Although the station launched in 1986 was to end its service 
life five years later, it will function normally till 1997 
according to experts' estimates. Tsibliev stressed that for 
this purpose it is necessary to take permanently preventive 
measures. 
  The cosmonauts safely returned to the earth and, judging by 
their statements, feel well. Some inconvenience is only caused 
by muscles which did not function under zero-gravity conditions, 
and which are forced "to work" now. 
  Tsibliev and Serebrov are satisfied with the fully completed 
programme of the expedition. As for explorations and 
experiments conducted on a commercial basis, they, according to 
Serebrov, "are evidently profitable". True, cosmonauts do not 
participate in signing such contracts, he admitted.
