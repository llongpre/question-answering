"Russian Cosmonaut Aboard the `Shuttle': Sergey Krikalev Becomes 
a Full-Fledged Member of the Crew"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, 3 February, the Russian cosmonaut 
Sergey Krikalev is to be sent into space aboard the "space 
shuttle" Discovery. 
  Our cosmonauts have not met with the Americans in orbit 
since 
the joint flight of Soyuz and Apollo in 1975. Although a joint 
Shuttle-Salyut flight was planned after Soyuz-Apollo, the 
agreement was cancelled because of a worsening of the political 
climate, and the meeting of the cosmonauts and astronauts in 
orbit was postponed indefinitely. 
  After the Soviet-American "handshake in orbit," cosmonauts 
from the entire socialist camp went into space aboard the 
Soyuzes. The American Shuttle crews included specialists not 
only from Western Europe, but also from Mexico and Saudi Arabia. 
  Sergey Krikalev, however, will not be a "diplomatic 
representative" of Russia in the intensely working crew. An 
engineer from NPO Energiya, an acrobatic pilot, and an 
experienced specialist in EVAs, Krikalev is departing on the 
flight as a full-fledged crew member -- a flight program 
specialist. The five astronauts and one cosmonaut are to place 
into orbit a platform for growing ultrapure semiconductor 
crystals and then bring it back aboard Discovery after 
completion of the experiments. 
  Krikalev trained for a little more than a year in the 
American Johnson Space Center, working with the Shuttle's remote 
manipulator. Now, using the "mechanical arm," he is to get the 
saucerlike platform from the cargo bay of the craft and bring it 
back later. "It's similar to the manual control of the Soyuz," 
Krikalev said, speaking of the work with the manipulator. "They 
say you `fly' the `arm' more than you control it." In the words 
of cosmonaut-astronaut Krikalev, you can generally acquire the 
skills for working with such manipulators by even, well, playing 
computer games -- racing airplanes or a "digger" on the screen. 
There it is -- the benefit of the "dandyization" of society! 
  In addition to the work with the "flying saucers," the crew 
will work in the commercial laboratory Spacelab, which is set up 
in the cargo bay. Spacelab is a fairly small additional 
compartment that roughly doubles the usable space of the Shuttle 
cabin. Of course, the weeklong flight with such an "add-on" 
can't be compared with ever so longer flights on the orbital 
station. So the flight of Krikalev and the flight of his backup, 
Vladimir Titov, planned for February 1995 about the Shuttle, are 
serving the role of prelude to the first stage of the 
Russian-American cooperation in the creation of the joint 
orbital station Alpha, as they're calling it for now. And in 
1995, an American astronaut will go up to the Mir station for 
three months. 
  Of course, the flight of Sergey Krikalev is no pioneering 
achievement. The launch slated for tomorrow will be the 60th 
launch of a Shuttle, and Krikalev himself has 464 days aboard 
Mir. But the political importance of the work of this kind is 
unquestionable. The Russians and the Americans are learning to 
work together. The future orbital station couldn't be built 
without it.
