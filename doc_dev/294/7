<HEAD>French, Soviet Spacemen Overcome Snags to Deploy Test Platform</HEAD>

   A French cosmonaut and a Soviet colleague overcame
problems outside the orbiting space station Mir on Friday and
unfurled a plastic web in a test of space construction techniques,
Soviet media reported.
   Jean-Loup Chretien of France and Soviet cosmonaut Alexander
Volkov began their spacewalk at 12:57 p.m. Moscow time (4 a.m. EDT)
and were scheduled to complete it in four hours, 20 minutes, the
Tass news agency said. But the spacewalk lasted six hours because of
several problems.
   It took longer than expected to lay a cable linking the plastic
structure's platform to the control panel inside Mir, Tass said.
Then the structure failed to unfold on the electronic command of
cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who was inside Mir.
   While scientists at the Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad
near Moscow studied the problem, the cosmonauts were out of radio
contact. When contact was restored, the cosmonauts exclaimed: ``It's
opened!'' Soviet television reported. The cosmonauts evidently shook
the structure to open it, a TV correspondent said.
   If it proves reliable, the platform could be used to hold
antennas and telescope mirrors.
   Also during the spacewalk, Chretien and Volkov mounted outside
Mir a panel with samples of different materials and coatings.
   After six months, the panel is to be removed and taken back to
Earth for study of how the materials and coatings withstood sharp
temperature fluctuations and solar radiation in space, Tass said.
   The Soviets have said they intend to build large structures in
space for research, and the techniques and materials the cosmonauts
tested Friday should help plan such projects.
   Soviet television provided live coverage of parts of the
spacewalk. It showed Chretien and Volkov, in white spacesuits,
floating outside Mir and working on the experiments. At one point,
they had to stop the work as they passed into a shadow.
   Along with Krikalev, the flight engineer, remaining inside Mir
during the spacewalk were cosmonauts Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov
and Valery Polyakov.
   Chretien will return to Earth with Titov and Manarov, who have
set an endurance record and will have been in space a full year when
they make the descent Dec. 21. Volkov, Polyakov and Krikalev will
remain on the Mir.
   Chretien and Volkov blasted off Nov. 26.
