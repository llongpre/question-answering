   Columbia's astronauts got a balky
observatory running Tuesday, but missed important targets and had
to revert to manual operations when the star-tracking system failed
to work automatically.
   Astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman did manage to spot the Soviet Mir
space station through binoculars and said it appeared as a small
point of light. Mir was orbiting with five men 32 miles above
Columbia, which is 218 miles above Earth.
   Mission specialist Mike Lounge saw the spacecraft on the next
orbit when Mir was closer. Horizontally, the two spacecrafts came
within about 44 miles of each other Tuesday.
   ``It's extremely frustrating,'' Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins
University, said of the latest problems.
   ``We've got this wonderful instrument ready to go and we're not
getting it pointed at any scientific targets except for brief
glimpses - brief enough to show how great it would be once it locks
on but not long enough to get the science we want to get,'' said
Davidsen, principal investigator for one of the observatory's three
ultraviolet telescopes.
   Earlier Tuesday, NASA officials said the $150 million Astro
observatory aboard the shuttle had been repaired but needed more
adjustments. The instrument pointing system is not expected to be
``100 percent'' for another few days, said mission scientist Ted
Gull.
   ``We're really in a stage where the observatory is starting to
come alive,'' Gull said. ``It's a lot later than where we wanted to
be. But I see no major show-stoppers.''
   More than 10 percent of the approximately 230 telescope
pointings was expected to be lost because of the interruptions in
Astro's round-the-clock observing. Astro was supposed to study
about 250 high-energy objects, including galaxies, quasars, a
supernova and a comet.
   Astronomers, braced for the worst, began the painful process of
removing low-priority targets from the viewing lineup because of
the malfunctions that delayed the 10-day mission's star-gazing.
There was no guarantee, however, that even the most important
objects would be studied in depth.
   The Johns Hopkins telescope, for example, missed two chances
Tuesday to study binary stars in the midst of rare cataclysmic
outbursts because of pointing system problems.
   ``We're tense about progress at the moment,'' Davidsen said.
   NASA had intended to start using the Astro observatory late
Sunday, less than 24 hours into the flight. Those plans were dashed
when the pointing system's star trackers experienced problems
shortly after liftoff.
   The trouble was almost resolved when an on-board computer
crashed Monday night, sending the astronauts and ground teams
``back to square zero,'' said mission manager Jack Jones. It wasn't
until Tuesday morning that the crew reported all three star
trackers seemed to be in good working order.
   Astronaut Ron Parise radioed down that the pointing system
``looks like it's steady as a rock.''
   ``It doesn't mean we can find the fields, but it's a step in the
right direction,'' Parise told ground controllers.
   The astronauts focused Astro's ultraviolet telescopes on the
nearby star Capella in the constellation Auriga, using the pointing
system's automatic mode. But they later had to return to manual
operations - a slow, awkward process - when the system failed to
lock onto a star. Other attempts followed, both manual and
automatic.
   The X-ray observatory, which is operated from the ground and has
its own pointing system, also focused on Capella. It was the first
time the instrument had received X-rays.
   ``The instrument is performing as expected if not better,'' said
NASA scientist Peter Serlemitsos, principal investigator of the
X-ray telescope.
   But later Tuesday night, an axis on the X-ray telescope fell out
of alignment, said NASA spokesman Bob Lessels. Ground controllers
hoped to correct the alignment and get the telescope working again
by early Wednesday.
   Lessels said he did not know what caused the alignment problem.
   Astro is nearly five years late in studying celestial sources of
ultraviolet light and X-rays, which cannot penetrate the atmosphere
and thus are invisible from Earth. The mission was scheduled for
March 1986, but was delayed by the Challenger accident early that
year.
   Four countdowns were halted this year because of shuttle fuel
leaks and a telescope problem before Columbia finally lifted off
Sunday. A Soviet Soyuz rocket blasted into orbit 1{ hours later
with two cosmonauts and a Japanese television reporter, bound for
space station Mir.
   The seven astronauts plan to contact the Mir cosmonauts via ham
radio toward the end of Columbia's mission. Parise, a licensed ham
radio operator, already has communicated with his father in Ohio
and other amateur radio operators.
   On a light note, Mission Control got its first glimpse of a new
trash compactor being used aboard the shuttle. Pilot Guy Gardner
put in a large bag of trash, pumped two handles back and forth, and
then pulled out a smashed bag.
   ``Ta-da,'' Gardner said, displaying the compressed bag before
middeck TV cameras.
   ``It's a little bit different from a household masher, but it's
doing us a lot of good up here,'' said Columbia's commander Vance
Brand.
