   A team of Soviet and French astronauts blasted off
from Central Asia on Saturday and headed for the Soviets' orbiting
space station Mir.
   The three cosmonauts aboard the Soyuz TM-7 were scheduled to
rendezvous aboard the Mir with three men already in orbit for what
Tass called the first practical preparations of an international
team for a manned expedition to Mars.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, wearing a coat and scarf,
peered through binoculars from a viewing stand at the Baikonur
Cosmodrome as the rocket lifted off in the darkness.
   Also present at the launch were two members of the British rock
group Pink Floyd, a favorite of French astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien.
   The launch was carried live by Soviet and French national
television.
   An hour after takeoff, the Soviet space center said all systems
were operating normally.
   Chretien is to remain aboard the Mir until Dec. 21, when he is
scheduled to return to Earth with two Soviet cosmonauts who will
have spent 365 days in orbit.
   With him in the launch vehicle were mission commander Alexander
Volkov and flight engineer Sergei Krikalev, who are expected to
spend about six months in space.
   Soviet television showed the cosmonauts in their space capsule
before the launch and apparently during the initial ascent.
   Volkov said in a prepared statement he read minutes before launch
that all equipment on board was in order.
   Chretien expressed his pride at being included as his country's
representative on the flight and told Mitterrand he appreciated the
Socialist president's presence at the launch.
   Chretien, a music lover, took with him a portable organ to play
aboard the Mir space station.
   ``It will be interesting to see how a man can accomplish delicate
tasks in weightlessness, and music is delicate,'' said Patrick
Baudry, who flew on a U.S. space shuttle mission in 1985. Baudry was
interviewed on French television.
   Because Chretien told a recent news conference that he liked the
rock group Pink Floyd, the crew was carrying one of the group's
albums into space, and two members of the band watched the launch at
Baikonur.
   During his mission, Chretien is to become the first West European
to make a walk in space.
   He is also planning to carry out scientific experiments prepared
by experts at France's National Center for Space Studies.
   Mitterrand and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Saturday
morning in Moscow for a final round of talks before the French
president left for the launch site.
   In his first meetings with Gorbachev on Friday, Mitterrand and
the Soviet leader talked about disarmament and improving economic
ties, according to Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov and Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine.
   France has harshly criticized the Soviet Union in the past for
alleged human rights violations, but its spokesman refrained from
commenting on that issue at Friday's news briefing.
   Officials also announced that French banks led by Credit Lyonnais
are extending a $2 billion credit line to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets also signed a joint venture agreement with the French
government-owned Pechiney SA metals group to build a $172.4 million
factory in Armenia for manufacturing aluminum packaging.
