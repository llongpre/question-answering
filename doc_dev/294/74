   Two Soviet cosmonauts broke a 326-day record for
endurance in space Saturday, and the official news agency Tass
announced that a second try to launch the Soviet space shuttle will
take place Tuesday.
   The first attempt to launch the shuttle Buran, on Oct. 29, ended
51 seconds before scheduled lift-off when a piece of equipment on
the launch pad failed to move away from the unmanned craft.
   Tass said the two cosmonauts on the space station Mir _ flight
commander Vladimir Titov, 41, and engineer Musa Manarov, 37 _ broke
last year's record established by colleague Yuri Romanenko.
   Titov and Manarov were reported healthy with only small changes
in their weight and muscle measurements.
   Scientists worry about atrophy when humans spend long periods in
zero gravity in space using just a fraction of their strength.
   The Buran space shuttle is due to lift off at 6 a.m. Tuesday (10
p.m. EST Monday). If the unmanned double orbit is successful,
officials will begin planning routine flights with a crew, Tass said.
   However, Soviet authorities said the Buran and its sister ships
will shoot off into space ``no more than two to four times a year.''
   Tass did not clarify whether that meant each shuttle would fly
only four times a year or whether the entire fleet would make just
four flights a year.
   Alexander I. Dunaev, director of the Soviet commercial space
agency Glavkosmos, said several shuttles are under construction.
   The Soviets have not said how many shuttles they plan to build.
But they will continue to use simpler, less expensive rockets to put
satellites into orbit, and save the shuttles for repair and hauling
cargo to the Mir space station.
   Buran, which means ``snowstorm'' in Russian, will circle the
earth twice on its first flight, and land at a specially constructed
runway back at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Kazakhstan in
Central Asia.
   ``The cause of the delay has now been eliminated and the Energia
(booster rocket) system with the Buran orbiter is undergoing
pre-launch preparations,'' Tass reported.
   The two cosmonauts on the space station Mir _ Titov and Manarov _
will get some company for their last month in orbit when two Soviet
colleagues and a Frenchman join them Nov. 26, Tass said. On Dec. 21,
Titov and Manarov will end their year in space by flying home with
the French cosmonaut, leaving their two Soviet colleagues in space.
   Titov has lost 4.4 pounds in space, and Manarov gained 3.3
pounds, Tass said.
   The U.S. record for the longest manned mission is 84 days, set in
1973 by astronauts Gerald Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard space station Skylab.
