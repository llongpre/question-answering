<HEAD>Soviets To Mothball Space Station For 3 Months</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union will leave the orbiting space
station Mir unmanned for three months because of delays in
preparing equipment that cosmonauts need to perform experiments
aboard the spacecraft, Tass says.
   The news agency said Wednesday that cosmonauts Alexander Volkov,
Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov will return to Earth April 27,
leaving the Mir station mothballed for only the second time since
it was launched in 1986.
   ``When three Soviet cosmonauts return back to Earth from their
orbiting station Mir in about a fortnight, the facility will be
left unmanned for several months due to delays with the preparation
of two research modules,'' Deputy Flight Director Viktor Blagov
told Tass.
   ``This is because without the two modules, which will make it
possible to conduct wide-ranging research, including studies in the
interest of the Soviet economy, there is little sense in keeping
cosmonauts on the space station any further,'' Blagov told the news
agency.
   Tass first announced Tuesday that the cosmonauts would return
and leave the station without a crew, but the report Wednesday
contained the first explanation of why the project was being
suspended.
   Some speculated the suspension was for economic reasons. The
move was announced after critics called for deep cuts in spending
on the space program. The announcement also came shortly after the
Soviets lost two probes to Mars at a cost of nearly $480 million.
   The mothballing of Mir makes economic sense, Blagov said. He
said that expensive new equipment, both on the ground and on the
space station, was needed, as well as training of future cosmonauts.
   ``It is fairly difficult to do this in the course of a manned
flight, so the adjournment will simplify many things,'' he said.
   The move, also announced on the evening television news program
Vremya, effectively cancels the launch of cosmonauts Alexander
Balandin and Alexander Viktorenko scheduled for April 19.
   The announcement coincided with Cosmonauts Day, the anniversary
of Yuri Gagarin's first manned space flight 28 years ago, which was
marked Wednesday night with a seven-minute fireworks display that
lit up the sky over Moscow.
   Blagov defended the cost of the space program.
   ``We plan to promote space commercial services and have already
begun to do this. Of the 19 agreements signed by the Soviet space
agency Glavkosmos with other countries and foreign firms, 10 have
been carried out,'' he said.
   Blagov admitted that the Soviet Union was not capitalizing on
space exploration. ``Soviet space technology is up to the highest
world standards, but industrial spin-offs are pitifully scanty as
very few of the space industry's achievements are turned over for
commercial use,'' he said.
   Mir, which the Soviets have said is the first building block of
a permanently manned space station, has been mothballed only once
before, a seven-month period following the return to Earth of its
first inhabitants, Vladimir Solovev and Leonid Kizim, June 25,
1986, after three months in space.
   Since the arrival of cosmonauts Yuri Romanenko and Alexander
Laveikin in February 1987, the spacecraft has been manned.
   On Dec. 20, cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov set a
world's record for space endurance, living aboard the Mir orbiter
for 365 days and 22 hours.
   They were joined in the final months of their record-setting
space voyage by Polyakov, a physician who traveled to the Mir
station on Aug. 28 to monitor the effects of living in a
gravity-free environment for extended periods.
   Titov and Manarov were replaced by Krikalev and Volkov. Polyakov
stayed aboard the orbiter to continue experiments in space health
techniques.
