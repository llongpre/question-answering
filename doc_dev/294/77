<LEADPARA>  Space shuttle Columbia glided through a clear sky and returned home with seven
astronauts today after a nine-day mission that provided new insight into how
humans adapt to space.;    Columbia landed on the desert base's concrete
runway at 8:39 a.m. returning to Earth without problems despite a loose cargo
bay door seal that had raised concern during the flight. The spaceship's
arrival was heralded by the customary twin sonic booms.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COLUMBIA ENDS 'SUPER FLIGHT' WITH LANDING
AT EDWARDS AFB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Congratulations on a super flight," Mission Control's Steve Oswald told
shuttle commander Bryan O'Connor after the orbiter rolled to a stop.;   
Columbia circled the world 146 times and logged 3,779,940 miles during the
journey, which began June 5. In addition to the four men and three women, the
shuttle carried a Spacelab research module, 29 rats and 2,478 tiny jellyfish.;
   More than 7,500 people gathered at Edwards for the landing.;    As the
astronauts prepared for landing earlier today, the shuttle's cargo bay doors
closed normally despite loose weatherstripping. The crew successfully latched
the left, then right, door as ground controllers anxiously monitored the
events.;    An emergency spacewalk would have been required if the damaged
seal had prevented the left door from shutting tightly.;    Astronaut James
Bagian watched the closing of the left door from a medical laboratory in the
payload bay. It was vital that the 60-foot doors close tightly; otherwise, the
shuttle could burn up during the fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.;   
Although data was beamed to the ground on whether the problem door closed
properly, Bagian provided extra information by watching from about 25 feet
away. NASA said all the latches on the left door snapped properly. The loose
seal did move into part of one latch as expected, but caused no trouble, NASA
said.;    NASA had been prepared, if necessary, to delay Columbia's landing
until Saturday.;    The astronauts' biggest problem during the flight, aside
from the loose seal, was two overheating refrigerator-freezer units. The crew
had to shuffle precious blood and urine samples from one laboratory freezer to
the other, depending on which worked at the time.;    Both freezers seemed to
be working well today, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.;   
The astronauts wrapped up their research Thursday with more blood collection,
and heart and lung tests. During the mission, the astronauts poked and prodded
each other in a series of experiments to learn more about how weightlessness
affects humans.;    Four astronauts will remain at Edwards a week after
landing for further medical tests. The rats and jellyfish also will be studied
after their return.  </TEXT>
