  [Text] Moscow 11 February TASS -- The U.S. and Russian 
ground mission control centers applauded today as the Discovery 
shuttle spacecraft carrying a U.S.-Russian crew on board 
successfully landed today at the Kennedy Space Center. 
  Charles Bolden, Ken Reightler, Franklin Chang-Diaz, Jan 
Davis, Ronald Sega and Sergey Krikalev spent slightly more than 
eight days in space and returned to the earth at 22:19 (Moscow 
time). The landing was postponed by almost two hours due to bad 
weather. 
  The crew conducted 35 scientific experiments in the sphere 
of 
material science, medicine and biology with the use of the 
spacehab laboratory and an installation for the production of 
super-clean thin films. The research was made to order of 
scientific and industrial organizations of the U.S. and Russia. 
  The flight is the first stage in the bilateral Mir-shuttle 
program, which will continue to the planned Alfa International 
orbiting station after several joint flights. 
  As for the immediate plans, a flight of Vladimir Titov 
(whose 
back-up is Sergey Krikalev) with a joint crew on board the U.S. 
shuttle is scheduled for January 1995. Titov is training at the 
Johnson Center (Houston, U.S.A.). Both U.S. astronauts, whose 
flight is scheduled for March 1, 1995, with the 18th main 
expedition of the Mir orbiting station have started training 
this week. 
  Bonnie Dunbar, the wife of U.S. astronaut Ronald Sega, and 
Norman Thagard are training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut training 
Center, the Moscow region.
