<LEADPARA>  Astronaut James Bagian told Mission Control to pick a card, any card, and
performed what may have been the first magic trick in space.;    After
spending the day investigating the mysteries of weightlessness, Bagian
presented a puzzle of his own Sunday night. Bagian, a physician, is part of a
team conducting medical tests aboard the space shuttle Columbia.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SHUTTLE ASTRONAUT SHOWS HE'S A REAL CARD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Bagian had left an unopened deck of cards at Mission Control before leaving
Earth last week and took another deck with him.;    Aided by his "lovely
assistant," pilot Sidney Gutierrez, Bagian talked Mission Control communicator
Marsha Ivins through the trick. She opened the deck in view of TV cameras,
shuffled the cards and put the pile on a console.;    "We knew that when we
came on this mission that when you get to fly at five miles a second, you get
a certain prescience, and you can tell the future," Bagian said.;    Bagian
said that before blastoff he picked a card out of his deck and placed it in
the opposite direction. He said it would match the one selected at Mission
Control.;    Ivins picked the four of spades.;    Bagian then displayed his
deck to show one card facing down. Gutierrez pulled it from the deck and
slowly flipped it over -- the four of spades.;    "A big round of applause!
That's truly incredible!" Ivins exclaimed. "Amazing.";    "It's hard to do a
trick like this, this far out," Bagian said. "For me, this was kind of a
do-or-die situation.";    The seven astronauts today began a sixth day of
orbital experiments to help scientists understand the effects of
weightlessness on the body. Shuttle commander Bryan O'Connor said his crew has
been working "awful hard" and could use a break Tuesday.;    "Give us a chance
to do some of the color TV stuff (Earth observations) that got deleted and
look out the windows and see their hometowns and enjoy being in space a little
bit," O'Connor told Mission Control.;    Later, after putting in two hours of
work, the astronauts conducted a brief television interview. O'Connor said he
and his crew agree with NASA's decision not to perform a spacewalk to fix a
loose seal on the cargo bay doors.;    O'Connor initially expressed concern
Saturday about the plan. He was more satisfied after analyzing test results
that showed the seal would not prevent the doors from closing tightly for the
fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.;    "Everybody was worried when we first
saw that seal," O'Connor said. "We needed to talk some more about it because
not being able to sit in on all the reviews and look at all the test data and
so on, we wanted to be sure we understood all the assumptions that went into
the decision.";    "But we're all in sync," he said. "We're happy with the
program we've got ahead.";    Columbia's nine-day mission is scheduled to end
Friday, but the flight could be extended a day if the doors don't shut
properly. Bagian and Tamara Jernigan would go into space to fix it.  </TEXT>
