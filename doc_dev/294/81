   A malfunctioning on-board computer delayed the
return to Earth today of a Soyuz TM-6 capsule carrying a French
cosmonaut and two Soviets who had spent a year in orbit aboard the
Mir space station.
   ``Automated telemetry showed an overload in the computing
complex,'' Soviet television said in a report from Mission Control.
   A landing scheduled for 9:50 a.m. Moscow time (1:50 a.m. EST) had
been scrubbed and scientists were sending new commands to the
computer in hopes of making a new landing attempt at 1 p.m., the
television reported.
   If the computer failed to respond, the cosmonauts could also
switch over to manual control to guide the ship back to Earth, the
report said, adding that the crew could safely spend another day in
orbit.
   There was no immediate word on the exact function of the
computer, or the nature of the overload.
   The craft was carrying cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa
Manarov, who marked one year in orbit on Tuesday, and Frenchman
Jean-Loup Chretien. It separated from the Mir orbiting complex on
schedule at 6:33 a.m. (10:33 p.m. EST Tuesday).
   On Sept. 7, another Soyuz capsule's landing was delayed when a
system malfunction twice aborted the craft's re-entry.
   In that incident, the crew of the Soyuz TM-5 craft returned to
Earth later that day, but only after the life support systems on
board were in danger of running out, Soviet media reported. That
flight carried the first Afghan in to space and had similarly
separated from Mir.
   Wednesday's landing was scheduled to occur in the republic of
Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia.
   Titov and Manarov are holders of the space endurance record. The
U.S. mark for the longest manned mission is 84 days, set in 1973 by
astronauts Gerald Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue aboard the
Skylab space station.
   Soviet space officials have said in the past that their endurance
efforts are an important part of preparations for a manned flight to
Mars that they hope will take place shortly after the turn of the
century.
   Chretien rocketed into space Nov. 26 along with cosmonauts
Alexander Volkov and Sergei Krikalev, who remained aboard the space
station. Valery Polyakov, sent to the space station in the fall to
monitor the health of Titov and Manarov, also will remain behind.
   While aboard the space station, Chretien and Volkov made a space
walk to deploy an experimental framework to help plan the
construction of scientific equipment.
   They also conducted a series of medical and biologial experiments.
