<LEADPARA>  NASA is weighing a daring plan to fix the nearsighted Hubble Space Telescope
in 1993 by fitting four instruments with pairs of mirrors the size of postage
stamps.;    The plan, worked out by a panel of engineers and astronomers,
would require three six-hour spacewalks by a team of astronauts. They would
replace the telescope's main camera and install a box the size of a telephone
booth to carry and deploy the corrective mirrors for three other instruments.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "This strategy recovers essentially all the science capabilities expected
at launch," said the report of a committee organized by the Space Telescope
Science Institute.;    Engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center have been doing an exhaustive
study of the recommendations since they were presented late last year.;   
"We've got to get serious and pick a design in the next three or four months,"
Dennis McCarthy, NASA's deputy program manager for Hubble, said Wednesday.;   
The telescope, launched with great fanfare last April from the space shuttle
Discovery, was designed to detect starlight that has traveled for billions of
years and events that occurred close to the Big Bang believed to have created
the universe.;    Soon after the Hubble went into orbit, scientists discovered
the main mirror was ground to the wrong prescription and that the telescope's
view of the universe was blurred.;    It was determined that when the
telescope was built 10 years ago, a technician improperly assembled a
measuring device used to determine the mirror's shape. Tests at the time
indicated a problem, but the warning was not heeded.;    A 700-pound box
called COSTAR will contain the mechanism to put the mirror pairs in place in
front of the telescope's faint object camera and two spectrographs. COSTAR
would be bolted into the space now occupied by a high-speed photometer.;   
The 1993 shuttle visit to the orbiting telescope had been planned before the
mission to replace the wide-field planetary camera, the main instrument. Plans
are now to fit that camera with the corrective mirrors as well.;    The
mirrors act, in effect, as high-tech eyeglasses do.;    In each pair, the
first corrective mirror passes an image of the Hubble's 94.5 inch-diameter
primary mirror onto a second mirror. The second glass is in the same form as
the Hubble's mirror, only in exact reverse, thus canceling the flaw.  </TEXT>
