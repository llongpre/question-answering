   Two cosmonauts nearly ran out of oxygen when a
sticky hatch prevented them from re-entering their space station,
but they will take another space walk next week to repair the door,
according to a newspaper report.
   The trouble occurred Tuesday while the cosmonauts were outside
their space station making repairs, said the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda.
   Pravda, in its Friday editions, quoted Yuri Isaulov, a ground
controller at the Soviet Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad, as
saying cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin will make
another space walk Thursday ``to put things in order.''
   The sticky hatch was the latest in a series of problems the
cosmonauts have faced during their six-month mission.
   Solovyev and Balandin went outside the Mir space station to fix
thermal insulation that was damaged during the launch of the Soyuz
TM-9 capsule they must use to return to Earth.
   The strenuous space walk took two hours longer than planned, and
the cosmonauts could not re-enter the spacecraft because of the
sticky hatch, Soviet media reported.
   Their oxygen was running dangerously low and they were forced to
use an emergency porthole on another part of the space station
complex to get back inside, seven hours after their exit.
   Once inside, the cosmonauts apparently closed an inner hatch to
seal one end of the airlock compartment that leads to the
troublesome outside hatch.
   Isaulov told Pravda that the outside hatch is ``slightly ajar,''
leaving the airlock compartment unsealed.
   ``This is not a normal situation and we would not like it to
continue,'' he said. ``So, we have informed the crew that they
would have to make another space walk on July 26 to put things in
order.''
   In their rush to get back into the space station, the cosmonauts
also left behind some ladders on a work platform where they were
fixing the insulation on the outside of the Soyuz capsule. Ground
controllers were studying videotapes of the exterior of the space
complex to see if that would cause a problem, Pravda said.
   The ladders and work platform attached to the Soyuz might hinder
the capsule when it separates from the Mir complex, said James
Oberg, author of several books on the Soviet space program, in an
interview from his Texas home.
   The thermal insulation protects the capsule while in space and
is separate from the shield that deflects heat during re-entry.
   The cosmonauts have been in space since Feb. 11. The ground
controllers plan to bring them home in the Soyuz capsule on Aug. 9.
They originally were scheduled to return July 30.
   A replacement crew is to be launched Aug. 1.
