   A Soyuz space capsule carrying two Soviets who set
a one-year space endurance record and a Frenchman landed safely
today after a three-hour re-entry delay caused by an overloaded
computer, Tass said.
   The official Soviet news agency said the craft, which separated
on schedule from the Mir space station earlier today, touched down
at 12:57 p.m. Moscow time 60 miles from the Baikonur space center in
Soviet Central Asia.
   Vladimir Titov and and Musa Manarov were joined for the descent
by a French astronaut, Jean-Loup Chretien of France, who spent
nearly a month on Mir.
   ``Immediate medical check-ups showed the cosmonauts are feeling
well,'' Radio Moscow said.
   The landing ended mankind's longest space mission. Titov and
Manarov had been in space for 365 days, 22 hours and 39 minutes.
   The cosmonauts left the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 2:18
p.m. on Dec. 21, 1987.
   Radio Moscow said Titov and Manarov were undergoing tests to
determine how well they had endured their lengthy flight. Soviet
officials have said the ability of cosmonauts to endure long periods
in space is a key to a manned flight to Mars they hope will take
place shortly after the turn of the century.
   Titov and Manarov replaced a crew including cosmonaut Yuri
Romanenko last December and went on to break Romanenko's record of
326 days in space.
   The official Tass news agency said the crew switched to a back-up
computer program after a fault developed in the operation of the
on-board computer. The main engine fired to slow the capsule at
12:08 p.m., and the living quarters and instrument module were
jetisoned, Tass said.
   As expected, radio contact with the craft was lost between a
height of 90 miles to 50 miles because the craft was enveloped by a
plasma cloud. The capsule's parachutes opened at a height of about
six miles.
   Soviet television reported before today's touchdwon that
``automated telementry showed an overload in the computing
complex,'' of a system aboard the Soyuz TM-6 capsule. It provided no
details.
   It was not clear whether re-entry was computer-guided or if the
cosmonauts switched over to manual control to guide the ship to
Earth as Tass had said they might. There also was no immediate word
on the exact function of the computer, or the nature of the overload.
   On Sept. 7, equipment and human error delayed by a full day the
landing of another Soyuz capsule that had separated from Mir. In
that incident, veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and Afghan Abdul
Ahad Mohmand ran dangerously low on food and air before landing
safely.
   At the time, Soviet media reported the capsule's life-support
system could hold out for two days but space officials said the
cosmonauts could make it stretch to a week. But today's mission
carried three cosmonauts instead of the two on board the September
mission.
   The U.S. mark for the longest manned mission is 84 days, set in
1973 by astronauts Gerald Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard the Skylab space station.
   Chretien rocketed into space Nov. 26 along with cosmonauts
Alexander Volkov and Sergei Krikalev, who remained aboard the space
station. Valery Polyakov, sent to the Mir orbiting complex in the
fall to monitor the health of Titov and Manarov, also remained
behind.
   While aboard the space station, Chretien and Volkov made a space
walk to deploy an experimental framework to help plan the
construction of scientific equipment. They also conducted a series
of medical and biologial experiments.
