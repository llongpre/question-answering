   In ``hush-hush'' surroundings,
Kennedy Space Center workers are readying the shuttle Atlantis for
launch on Thursday with five astronauts and a Defense Department
satellite set to spy on the Soviet Union.
   The secrecy contrasts markedly with the Discovery flight earlier
this fall, which was heavily publicized by NASA every step of the
way as the nation's return to space following the Challenger
disaster.
   Hundreds of thousands of spectators watched Discovery take off
and land, but Atlantis will be off-limits to the public. Personnel
working on Atlantis are cautioned not to talk about mission details
with wives, husbands, friends, unauthorized persons or, especially,
reporters.
   Only those with special clearance are allowed to work around the
payload, which was transported to the launch pad in darkness and
loaded in the shuttle's cargo bay two weeks ago.
   When the countdown starts, the launch team will be in a control
center secured against unauthorized entry or electronic
eavesdropping on computers and radio transmissions.
   The Pentagon would like to keep the launch and entire flight a
deep secret. But, realizing it can't do that with a program as
visible as the shuttle, it has agreed to release some information.
   It has allowed NASA, for instance, to report the countdown will
start Monday and that launch of the second post-Challenger shuttle
flight will occur Thursday between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. EST. The
precise time will be disclosed just nine minutes before liftoff.
   Sources report the launch is set for about 7 a.m.
   Once Atlantis is safely in orbit, there will be a brief statement
reporting everything is fine. Then there will be a news blackout
until NASA gives notice that the shuttle will land in 24 hours at
Edwards Air Force Base in California. The mission is expected to
last three or four days.
   The silence will be broken only if the astronauts experience a
serious spacecraft problem.
   The flight will be directed from another secure control center at
NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, with certain military
aspects controlled from an Air Force facility in Sunnyvale, Calif.
Communications between spacecraft and ground will be encrypted.
   This will be the 27th shuttle flight and the third dedicated
solely to military purposes. Both the earlier military flights were
flown in 1985. The Defense Department claims the secrecy makes it
more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships sitting off Cape
Canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   Critics contend such secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets,
with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already know a
great deal about the upcoming mission. And once Atlantis' satellite
is in its own orbit, they say the Russians will be able to track it
precisely and know exactly what it is doing.
   Indeed, much already has leaked out and been published about the
satellite. Sources report it is to circle the globe in an orbit that
will fly over 80 percent of the Soviet Union. There it will gather
detailed radar images and other intelligence data, much of it aimed
at helping U.S. intelligence officials verify Soviet compliance with
arms control treaties.
   The sources say the satellite has an antenna that will spread out
150 feet and that it cost about $500 million, making it one of the
most expensive satellites ever built.
   The sources also report the five crew members will conduct
several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military
observer in space, with reconnaissance a high priority. It is
believed the astronauts will test a special optical device that
resembles hand-held binoculars.
   The Air Force has been planning several experiments for upcoming
shuttle flights to determine how useful astronauts can be for
strategic reconnaissance, surveillance of Soviet naval forces and
other operational military objectives.
   The tests will be coordinated with ground exercises, including
troop maneuvers, naval movements and ballistic missile launches. The
military is not disclosing which of the exercises will be conducted
on the upcoming flight.
   All five crew members are military officers. Navy Cmdr. Robert L.
Gibson is the commander, Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner is the
pilot and the mission specialists are Air Force Col. Richard M.
Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr. William M.
Shepherd.
   Gibson, Mullane and Ross flew on earlier shuttle missions.
   During deployment of the satellite, believed set for the second
day, Mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm which
is to lift the cargo out of the payload bay. Shepherd and Ross
reportedly will be suited up in the shuttle airlock, prepared to
make a spacewalk if there is a problem with the deployment.
   Gibson and Gardner also will be busy checking out more than 200
modifications made to the orbiter to improve safety and reliability
as a result of the Challenger explosion that killed the crew of
seven on Jan. 28, 1986.
   These changes also were made to Discovery, which was launched
Sept. 29, ending a 32-month interruption in the program that
followed Challenger.
   NASA and the astronauts who piloted Discovery reported that,
except for a few minor problems, the ship flew flawlessly.
