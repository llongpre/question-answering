   Columbia's astronauts, thrilled to
finally be orbiting Earth, activated telescopes inside the space
shuttle Sunday for more than a week of probing galaxies, quasars
and other hot, turbulent objects.
   The shuttle roared to life at 1:49 a.m. EST Sunday and streaked
through a moonlit sky after six months of trying to get off the
ground. Three hours later, the seven-man crew began the daylong
process of getting the $150 million Astro observatory ready for
operation.
   ``It's like an early Christmas present,'' NASA launch director
Bob Sieck said at a post-launch news conference. ``It's been a goal
all year ... to get Astro and Columbia on orbit. You could say it
took all year to get there, but we're there and we're sure happy
about it.''
   It was the fifth launch attempt for the mission, first scheduled
for 1986 but postponed by the Challenger accident. Fuel leaks
halted three countdowns, including the first one in May, and
telescope problems ended another.
   Thick clouds on Sunday threatened to cause yet another delay.
The Air Force, which is responsible for range safety, dispatched a
helicopter to assure visibility would be sufficient. That check
postponed liftoff 21 minutes.
   Less than 1{ hours after Columbia lifted off, a Soviet rocket
hurtled into orbit with two cosmonauts and a Japanese television
journalist who will join two other men at space station Mir.
   Twelve people consequently are now in space, the most at one
time, and the Americans are hoping to communicate with their Soviet
and Japanese counterparts by ham radio during the mission.
   Scientists who have been working for years on the Astro project
said they could hardly believe it when Columbia finally took off.
   ``We were so used to not getting it off, the idea that it's
actually been launched and it's up there orbiting the Earth is
amazing,'' said Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins University,
principal investigator for one of the telescopes.
   ``We're working minor problems and we're delighted to be working
them after 11 years, believe me,'' said mission scientist Ted Gull.
   The first difficulty involved the instrument pointing system for
the three ultraviolet telescopes. The system's star trackers failed
to work properly in a stowed position, but appeared to operate well
after being elevated in the cargo bay, said mission manager Jack
Jones.
   Later in the day, one of the three trackers had trouble
detecting dim stars and was being readjusted to use brighter
objects for calibration purposes.
   The pointing system was used only once before, for solar
observations in 1985. Numerous problems were encountered during
that mission, known as Spacelab-2.
   ``I had visions of Spacelab-2 dancing in my head,''
astronaut-astronomer Robert Parker told Mission Control.
   There were some telescope problems later, most of which were
resolved quickly, and a computer terminal in the flight deck was
turned off after Columbia commander Vance Brand smelled something
burning. The computer is believed to have overheated.
   Scientists still hoped to make their first scientific
observation by early Monday. Among the early targets are Capella, a
nearby star in the constellation Auriga with an ultraviolet-oozing
corona and a supernova remnant in the constellation Vela that is
considered a bright X-ray source.
   Columbia's seven astronauts are splitting 12-hour shifts during
the 10-day mission, the first shuttle trip in five years devoted
entirely to scientific research.
   Parker and the three other astronomers on board will operate the
ultraviolet telescopes round-the-clock. The X-ray telescope will be
managed by computer commands sent from Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md.
   The observatory will focus on about 240 high-energy objects in
space - such as quasars, a supernova and even a comet - as Columbia
orbits 218 miles high. Ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from
such objects cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere and thus are
invisible from the ground.
   Scientists expect to improve their understanding of the
so-called invisible universe by measuring ultraviolet and X-ray
radiation. In addition to stars and galaxies, Astro will examine
Jupiter as well as Comet Levy, which is moving rapidly out of the
solar system.
   After a year of frustrations - two leaky shuttles, a flawed
mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope, overhauled space station
designs - the astronomy mission is helping NASA finish the year on
an upswing. It is the third shuttle flight in as many months, a
pace not seen since 1985.
   The Soviet rocket - which also launched a Soviet effort to
commercialize its space program - lifted off from the remote
Central Asian steppes of Kazakhstan.
   Journalist Toyohiro Akiyama, 48, joined Soviet cosmonauts Viktor
Afanasyev and Musa Manarov in the Soyuz TM-11 space capsule.
Akiyama was a passenger under a $12 million contract between the
Soviet Union and Japan's biggest private television company, TBS.
   Akiyama, a TBS news director who quit a four-pack-a-day
cigarette habit during the training, was asked before liftoff what
he looked forward to most on his return from the first trip into
space by a Japanese citizen.
   ``I can't wait to have a smoke,'' he said.
