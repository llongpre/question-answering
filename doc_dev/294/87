   Five astronauts tracked a perfect
countdown Thursday as technicians prepared the shuttle Atlantis for
a midafternoon launch on Friday. The mission will propel NASA's
``Magellan'' probe to Venus and revive America's deep-space science
program.
   ``After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious
to get started,'' said John H. Gerpheide, Magellan project manager.
   Officials described the countdown as the smoothest of four since
the Challenger disaster. The chance of high winds provided slight
concern as NASA looked forward to liftoff in an unusually tight
launch window that opens at 2:24 p.m. EDT and lasts justs 23
minutes.
   Magellan, ready for its 15-month flight to Venus, ``is 100
percent healthy and ticking along,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's
chief scientist. ``We're ready to go fly,'' said Richard Truly, who
heads the shuttle program and is the incoming NASA administrator.
   Earlier Thursday, three Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth,
leaving the Mir space station unattended for the first time in more
than two years. Two of the cosmonauts had been in space for five
months, the other for eight months.
   Atlantis' cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar
system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of
Venus and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million, not
including the $225 million cost of the four-day shuttle flight.
   Magellan's radar images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by
computer, should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about
the size of a football field. That is 10 times sharper than
previous pictures of the planet.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the radar
images could help scientists understand how Venus was formed and
might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how Earth and
Venus evolved so differently even though they were almost identical
when the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   The Magellan deployment is scheduled 6 hours 18 minutes after
liftoff, with astronauts Mark Lee and Mary Cleave conducting a
countdown from inside their shuttle cabin. An hour after the
release, a rocket is to fire to hurl the 7,600-pound unmanned probe
on a 450-day journey to Venus, a complex trip that takes Magellan
one and one-half times around the sun before it intercepts its
target planet.
   The Atlantis crew also includes commander David Walker, pilot
Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard. Lee is the only
one who has not flown on a previous shuttle mission.
   Spending cutbacks and delays forced by the 1986 Challenger
accident prompted NASA to use the roundabout approach to Venus. The
trip could have been made in four months under better circumstances.
   The first American planetary mission since 1978 will mark the
beginning of a busy year for NASA's planetary program. ``In August
the Voyager spacecraft will fly by Neptune and in October we'll
launch Galileo (from the shuttle) to Jupiter,'' Gerpheide said.
   At a briefing for reporters Thursday, NASA's Fisk vowed, ``No
one is going to question our leadership in planetary (flight)
again.''
   The Atlantis countdown began Tuesday and was progressing so
smoothly Thursday that the launch team had time to relax during a
15-hour halt of the clock. The time had been set aside for catchup
work.
   ``We just don't have anything out there that we're worried
about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue
that way,'' said countdown director Ron Phelps.
   Weather officers said they were keeping one eye on scattered
clouds which were moving into the skies above Moron, Spain, where
an airbase serves as an emergency landing site in the event of a
problem after launch.
   The astronauts were briefed throughout the day on the status of
the countdown and reviewed their flight plans. They were to retire
early Friday, arising about 9 a.m. to prepare for the afternoon
launch. Only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after
noon.
   Magellan is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to 90
percent of the surface during 243 Earth days, equal to one Venusian
day.
   Low resolution pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft hint at
Earth-like mountain ranges and rolling plains, but the surface
temperature on Venus is 900 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is
90 times that of Earth's.
   The last planetary mission launched by the United States was the
1978 Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will take
the first closeup look at Neptune in August after earlier exploring
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   Other major science projects planned in the next three years are
the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope from a shuttle early next
year, the Ulysses probe to study the sun in October, 1990, and the
Mars Observer spacecraft in 1992.
