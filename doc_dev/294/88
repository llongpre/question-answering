   Space shuttle Atlantis lifted off
into a windy sky at the last possible minute Friday _ a
spectacularly public act to carry into orbit a $500 million secret
satellite that can pierce darkness or clouds to vastly enhance
America's capacity to spy on the Soviets.
   Not a word was heard outside the NASA and Air Force control rooms
from commander Robert Gibson or the four other military crewmen who
are carrying out the highly classified mission to deploy the 18-ton
satellite Lacrosse.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge, who observed the liftoff
from the control center, thanked the launch team, saying ``let me
tell you that you have made a great contribution to the nation's
national security.''
   NASA waited out the same kind of fierce, high-altitude winds that
caused the postponement of the flight Thursday, found a momentary
calm, and set Atlantis flying almost straight up on a northward path
from the Kennedy Space Center. Liftoff time was exactly 9:30:34 EST
_ less than 90 seconds before the end of the three-hour launch
opportunity period.
   ``Very clean, by the numbers,'' is how mission commentator Brian
Welch at Mission Control in Houston characterized the start of the
flight. ``The vehicle is in very clean shape. There are no systems
problems whatsoever to report.''
   The public communications system, a 24-hour operation on most
shuttle flights, fell silent thereafter. Acting on Air Force orders,
NASA planned to break that silence only to say that the astronauts
had an OK to proceed with their mission's task and to give 24-hour
notice for Atlantis' return. The flight is expected to last three or
four days with landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   The first announcement came four hours into flight, when Mission
Control reported: ``The crew of Atlantis is go for orbit
operations.'' That meant the ship's cargo bay doors were open and
the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could begin.
   ``All crew members are doing well and all systems of the orbiter
are performing satisfactorily,'' Mission Control said.
   Navy Cmdr. Gibson's crew is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner,
the pilot; Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the
Air Force, and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   The outlines of their mission no longer are a secret _ not even
to the Soviets _ but details remain classified. Filling Atlantis'
cargo hold is one of the most expensive satellites ever built. It is
not deterred by clouds or darkness from gathering radar images on
the ground below.
   Atlantis' liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third
all-military mission was witnessed by a smaller-than-usual crowd of
a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides.
It was the third time Atlantis had been launched into orbit.
   The shuttle was in view of the launch site well past the
two-minute point when its spent booster rockets fell off. The
failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of
Challenger and loss of its seven-person crew on Jan. 28, 1986.
   According to sources who spoke on condition they not be
identified, Mullane will use the shuttle's crane to drop the
satellite _ one of a series named Lacrosse _ overboard. The
satellite's orbit will take it over the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, and the information it gleans should help U.S. intelligence
officials verify Soviet arms control compliance as well as serving
as a ``radar eye'' for the new B2 stealth bomber.
   Defense officials contended the secrecy made it more difficult
for Soviet satellites and spy ships off the Florida coast to monitor
the flight and learn its purpose.
   According to the official news agency Tass, the Soviets already
know much about Lacrosse. Its antenna, sources said, spreads out 150
feet and it has a 100-foot long radar screen.
   During deployment of the satellite, believed set for Saturday,
Mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm to lift the
satellite out of the cargo bay. Shepherd and Ross reportedly will be
suited up in the spacecraft airlock, prepared to make a spacewalk if
there is a problem with the satellite release.
   After the Lacrosse is set free, Gibson and Gardner are to back
off several hundred feet and fly formation with the payload until
ground controllers are certain it is working properly. If it is not,
an effort may be made to retrieve it for return to Earth.
   The sources also report the five crew members will conduct
several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military
observer in space, with reconnaissance a high priority.
   It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device
that resembles hand-held binoculars.
   The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises
that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballistic
missile launches.
   The countdown was halted several times during the morning to wait
out high-altitude winds up to 126 mph. Starting before dawn, a pilot
flew continuously through the launch path and balloons were sent
aloft to take readings.
   Thursday's launch had been scrubbed by strong winds eight miles
high and clouds made conditions marginal at best. Friday, by
contrast, the sky was brilliantly blue and there was bright sunshine
above fleecy clouds. The troublesome winds were five miles up.
   Toward the end of the 6:32-to-9:32 a.m. ``window of
opportunity,'' launch control got balloon data that showed
acceptable winds. The count continued only to be halted again at the
31-second mark, because of concern about weather at a site in Spain
where the shuttle would have landed in case of emergency.
   ``You gave us some heart failure there toward the end, but we got
it off,'' NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher told the launch team.
``My thanks for another great job.''
