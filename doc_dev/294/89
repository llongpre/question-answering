   NASA technicians have removed the
last experiment from a scientific satellite that was rescued in
January after nearly six years in space and survived far better
than expected.
   ``It really looks like brand new,'' said William Kinard, chief
scientist for the Long Duration Exposure Facility, or LDEF.
   ``The surprising thing to us is although there was a lot of
weathering apparent on the outside, most of that weathering was
really only skin-deep,'' he said Wednesday, a day after the last
experiment tray was removed.
   The satellite's condition is so good, in fact, it demonstrates
long-lasting space facilities such as the Freedom manned space
station are feasible, Kinard said.
   The proposed space station has come under attack in recent weeks
because of a Johnson Space Center study that concludes an unusually
high number of astronaut spacewalks would be needed for
maintenance. By the time it's completed and manned in 1999, the
space station is expected to cost more than $30 billion.
   ``It (LDEF) certainly gives you a great deal of confidence in
the ability to build things like space station and any spacecraft
that has to function for a long period of time,'' Kinard said.
``With reasonable care, there's no reason why you can't get
extremely long lifetimes.''
   The laboratory was placed in orbit in April 1984 for an expected
10 months. Because of delays, however, the satellite was not
retrieved until January, when astronauts aboard the shuttle
Columbia snared it 200 miles out in space.
   It is the longest time a spacecraft has been in space before
being retrieved for study.
   Barring a rescue, the $15 million to $18 million laboratory
would have come crashing down through the atmosphere right about
now and all 57 scientific experiments attached to its exterior
would have been lost. If not for gravity, the structure could have
lasted many more years in space although some of the experiments
may have decayed, Kinard said.
   None of the experiments were lost as a result of the satellite's
unexpectedly long stay in space. Some even were enhanced because of
the additional exposure, Kinard said.
   Most of the experimental trays have been returned to their
principal investigators for further analysis, including one
involving 12.5 million tomato seeds. The seeds were sent into space
for eventual planting by school students.
   Those seeds currently are being distributed to schools around
the country so students can monitor the growth process and report
the findings to NASA.
   Now that LDEF is empty, technicians plan to spend the next few
weeks inspecting the 8,000-pound aluminum shell then pack it for
storage at Kennedy Space Center. The laboratory was designed to be
reusable and could venture into space again, Kinard said.
   ``It is worth keeping,'' he said.
