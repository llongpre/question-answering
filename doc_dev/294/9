<LEADPARA>  Space shuttle Atlantis landed with five astronauts today after a triumphant
spacewalking mission that lasted a day longer than planned because of strong
desert wind.;    Atlantis glided through the sky and touched down at 6:55 a.m.
PDT, shortly after sunrise. The arrival was heralded by twin sonic booms that
shook the ground.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ATLANTIS LANDS IN TRIUMPH: 'YOU MADE IT LOOK
EASY'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Mission Control's Brian Duffy told Cmdr. Steven Nagel, "Steve, you and your
crew did it all and you made it look easy. Congratulations on a great job.";  
 About 1,100 spectators cheered as Atlantis landed smoothly on the dry lake
bed and rolled to a stop.;    Atlantis circled the world almost 93 times
during the six days in space. It traveled 2,480,016 miles.;    Mission Control
issued the go-ahead for a landing in the Mojave Desert after the winds calmed
down this morning. Powerful gusts prevented Atlantis from landing there as
planned Wednesday.;    Flight directors passed up an earlier landing
opportunity at Kennedy Space Center because of fog and clouds. The weather in
Florida later cleared, but NASA opted for the spacious lake bed at Edwards Air
Force Base.;    The crew of four men and one woman could have stayed up until
Saturday.;    Atlantis' astronauts accomplished their primary task on Sunday,
releasing the 17-ton Gamma Ray Observatory. It will circle the Earth for more
than two years in search of gamma rays, the most intense radiation in the
universe.;    The crew also undertook the first American spacewalks in five
years -- one an emergency mission to fix a stuck antenna on the $617 million
observatory, the other to lay groundwork for a $30 billion space station NASA
hopes to start building in 1995.;    NASA said the crew gathered a wealth of
engineering information from the spacewalks, during which they tested tools
and construction methods for the orbiting laboratory.;    Mission Control
awoke crew members today shortly after midnight -- about 1 1/2 hours early --
to prepare them for a possible Florida landing.;    They were greeted with
music from the TV series "Magnum, P.I." and a taped message from its star, Tom
Selleck. Astronaut Linda Godwin is a big Selleck fan, NASA said.;    "Good
morning, and a special wake-up to Linda," the message said. "This is Tom
Selleck and I hope you had a nice night's sleep, but it's time to get up and
go to work.";    On Wednesday, after Mission Control waved off the shuttle,
the crew members pulled their ham radio back out and chatted with radio
operators. They also got in some more sightseeing as they orbited Earth at
17,400 mph.;    "It is incredible. Some of the views are amazing," said
astronaut Jay Apt. "You wouldn't believe it. This spacecraft has great
windows.";    The mission, the first of 1991, began with liftoff Friday.;   
Discovery was supposed to go up first, but cracked door hinges forced NASA to
postpone its military flight in March to late April. Atlantis also has hinge
cracks, but NASA said they were much smaller and posed no danger.;    The
doors, on the orbiter's belly, must close tightly to prevent the craft from
being destroyed by the heat of re-entering the atmosphere.  </TEXT>
