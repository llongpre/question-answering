   Five astronauts who will deploy the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope from the shuttle Discovery said
Thursday excitement is mounting at NASA as the April 12 launch date
draws closer.
   The astronomical observatory, nearly seven years late in lifting
off, will be placed in orbit 370 miles above Earth and enable
scientists to see things so distant that their light has taken
almost since the beginning of the universe to reach Earth.
   ``I think I can speak for everybody in that we can feel the
excitement building quite a bit now in these last few weeks. We're
just glad to be finally this close to launch,'' said Air Force Col.
Loren J. Shriver, the crew's commander.
   ``We'll all feel a little bit of disbelief that we're finally
getting to do this. We'll probably all feel a certain amount of
pride,'' mission specialist Steven A. Hawley said at a news
conference.
   Hawley is scheduled to use the shuttle's robot arm to deploy the
telescope on the second day of the five-day mission.
   ``I can't even begin to imagine how good we're going to feel
because it's been so long,'' said Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden
Jr., the mission's pilot.
   The Hubble, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built,
originally was scheduled for launch in late 1983 but technical
problems postponed liftoff until 1985 and then 1986. The Challenger
explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, delayed the mission until 1989, and
concern over the shuttle's solid fuel booster rockets pushed it
back yet again.
   From its orbit, the 25,000-pound, 43-foot-long telescope will be
able to detect light of all wavelengths, including ultraviolet,
before it is absorbed or distorted by the atmosphere.
   The telescope will look seven times more deeply into space and
detect objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity
than the best ground-based observatory. Its eight-foot primary
optical mirror is the most precise ever made.
   Astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant
that their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.
Scientists believe the universe is 15 billion years old.
   The other crew members are mission specialists Kathryn D.
Sullivan and Bruce McCandless II, a Navy captain, who both said
they are ready to go on a spacewalk if necessary to repair or
retrieve the observatory if necessary after deployment.
   Shriver said he is not concerned about damaged axle nuts found
on the nose wheels of Atlantis and Columbia and suspected to be the
same on Discovery. NASA temporarily delayed Discovery's move to the
launch pad last week until technicians concluded there was no
threat to the mission.
   Because of their prestigious payload, the astronauts have found
themselves the subject of considerable attention and even a little
envy within NASA.
   ``There's no such thing as a bad mission,'' Hawley said. ``But I
think there are a lot of people who would like to trade places with
us.''
