   Reagan administration officials rejected an
Air Force plan for a U.S.-Soviet mission that would involve
astronauts and cosmonauts using a Russian spacecraft to recover a
device from a Star Wars satellite, an industry magazine reported
Friday.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology, in an edition dated for
Monday, said Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, director of the Air
Force's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, proposed the
joint mission as a way of demonstrating U.S. willingness to share
the SDI (Star Wars) technology.
   The plan called for the launch in August or September of an SDI
satellite that would carry a breadbox-sized materials package
attached to its hull.
   The package would be recovered in a joint U.S.-Soviet mission
that would involve flying an astronaut and an American manned
manuevering unit with cosmonauts aboard a Russian spacecraft. The
manned manuevering unit, or MMU, is a backpack with compressed gas
jets that permits astronauts to fly around untethered in space.
   Aviation Week said the Soviet craft would be launched and then
linked up with the Soviet Mir space station. The astronaut or a
cosmonaut then would fly from Mir to the SDI satellite and recover
the package.
   Aviation Week did not name its source for the story.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Edwina Palmer of the SDI office refused to
confirm or deny the magazine story, saying she couldn't comment on
``internal deliberations.''
   Bill Sheehan, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said he also was unable to confirm or deny the
story.
   ``I have not been able to determine if that happened or not,''
Sheehan said.
   Aviation Week said NASA officials, including some astronauts at
the Johnson Space Center, were opposed to the idea. But the
magazine said engineers at Johnson and at a Martin Marietta plant
did study the feasibility of adapting the manned manuevering unit
so it would fit through the hatch of the Mir space station.
   Brian Welch, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center, declined
comment.
