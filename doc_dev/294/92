   After struggling for weeks to fix
fuel leaks, NASA intends to try once again this week to send
Columbia up to study some of the hottest objects in the universe.
   The shuttle, sporting new hydrogen lines, is scheduled to lift
off at 1:17 a.m. EDT Saturday with seven astronauts and the $150
million Astro observatory. The countdown is due to begin early
Wednesday.
   As Columbia orbits 218 miles above Earth, Astro will probe
high-energy ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from stars,
galaxies, quasars, even a comet and supernova. Such radiation is
invisible from the ground.
   The mission, scheduled to last nine to 10 days, will be the
first in five years devoted entirely to scientific research.
   It also will be the first shuttle flight since Discovery carried
the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in April. That's the
longest gap between missions since flights resumed following the
1986 Challenger disaster.
   ``We're certainly aware we will be getting a lot more public
attention. Will that affect what we're doing? Not at all,'' said
Jeffrey Hoffman, one of four astronomers on board to operate Astro.
``We were always going at it 105 percent.''
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off with Astro in
March 1986; one of the targets was to have been Halley's Comet.
That mission and all others were put on hold after Challenger
exploded in January 1986.
   This year, after a revamping of Astro's observation plans,
launch was set for May 30, but hydrogen escaped from Columbia
during fueling and the flight was called off.
   Atlantis took Columbia's place at the pad but also was found to
have a hydrogen leak, and its classified military mission was
delayed from July to November.
   Atlantis was rolled back to the hangar 2{ weeks ago, and a newly
repaired Columbia reclaimed the pad.
   ``Yeah, it's frustrating,'' Hoffman said, noting all the delays.
``One of the things that you absolutely need in this business is
patience and also the ability not to take all of these things
personally.''
   Besides coping with leaky shuttles, the space agency has spent
the past several months investigating the cause of Hubble's
blemished mirror.
   More recently, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
engineers have been struggling with the periodic loss of radio
contact with the Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft.
   Consequently, NASA expresses eagerness for success.
   ``Everyone is very anxious for our mission to go very well,''
said Gene Urban, deputy mission scientist for Astro. ``We're really
a little nervous, I'd say, about having everything work right.''
   ``I'm worried that it normally comes in threes, so maybe I have
two more to go'' following Hubble, said Charles Pellerin Jr.,
NASA's director of astrophysics.
   Scientists' main concern with Astro is the instrument pointing
system for the three ultraviolet telescopes. The pointing system
has been used only once before, for solar observations in 1985, and
numerous problems were encountered.
   About half of the 150 or so objects Astro will observe _ some of
them millions of degrees _ will be new this time around, said
mission scientist Ted Gull. Many of the May targets had to be
replaced because they got too close to the sun for the instruments
to see.
   Columbia's flight will be the first of five Spacelab missions
dedicated to a single subject _ astrophysics.
   Among the questions astronomers hope Astro will answer on its
first outing are how much helium existed shortly after the universe
was created, and what powers quasars, the most distant objects in
the universe.
   Columbia's crew is taking advantage of the mission's scientific
focus to conduct ``Space Classroom,'' the first of what NASA hopes
will become a regular series for youngsters. More than 40 middle
school students at two NASA centers will question the astronauts
through a two-way audio link.
   The crew hopes to contact the two cosmonauts aboard space
station Mir by ham radio, marking the first time direct radio
communications is made between a U.S. and Soviet spacecraft.
   Payload specialist Ron Parise, a licensed ham radio operator,
also plans to contact amateur radio stations around the world.
   Commanding the mission is Vance Brand, who at age 59 will become
the oldest astronaut to fly in space.
