   A trouble-free countdown gave NASA
workers some breathing room today as preparations proceeded toward
Friday's midafternoon launch of Atlantis and five astronauts. The
mission will propel a probe to Venus on the first space shuttle
planetary mission.
   ``We're ready to go fly,'' said Richard Truly, the former
astronaut who has been nominated as NASA administrator. The
Magellan spacecraft, ready for its 15-month flight to Venus, ``is
in good shape,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist. After
an 11-year hiatus in deep space exploration, he said, ``No one is
going to question our leadership in planetary (flight) again.''
   Officials called it their smoothest countdown in 29 shuttle
missions.
   ``We just don't have anything out there that we're worried
about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue
that way,'' NASA test director Ronald Phelps told reporters.
   Phelps spoke as the countdown was halted for 15-hours, 34
minutes. The hold was planned to allow for any catchup work in case
of problems, but Phelps said there were none.
   As the NASA crew prepared for its four-day flight, three Soviet
cosmonauts returned to Earth today, leaving the Mir space station
unmanned for the first time in more than two years. Three of the
cosmonauts had been in orbit for five months, the third for eight
months.
   When the Atlantis count resumes shortly before midnight, the
launch team will make preparation to begin loading more than
500,000 gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tanks.
   The only concern, and it was slight, was the possibility of
crosswinds of more than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the
launch pad.
   Shuttle managers assessed all facets of the flight during a
day-long meeting Wednesday and reported, ``all preparations are
progressing satisfactorily. There are no technical or programmatic
issues. ... Weather is expected to be good.''
   Liftoff of the 29th shuttle mission and the fourth since the
Challenger explosion three years ago is set for 2:24 p.m. Friday.
The launch team will have only a 23-minute period in which to get
the shuttle off the ground because of the need to deploy the
Magellan probe from a precise point in space and the requirement
that liftoff occur before darkness falls on emergency landing sites
in Spain and Morocco.
   The astronauts were to review flight plans and make efficiency
runs in jet aircraft today.
   They are commander David Walker, pilot Ron Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norm Thagard.
   Late Friday, about six hours after liftoff, Lee and Cleave will
release Magellan from the cargo bay and an hour later a rocket will
hurl the 7,600-pound payload on a 450-day voyage to Venus.
   Magellan is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to 90
percent of the surface with a high resolution radar system.
   Its images should reveal details as small as 100 yards across,
about the size of a football field. This is 10 times sharper than
any previous pictures of the planet.
   ``All our previous data from Venus has been low resolution and
about all that data has done is tell us basically there are
continent-size mountain masses on Venus and that there are
extensive rolling plains,'' Magellan project scientist Joseph Boyce
said Friday.
   ``We don't know whether Venus ever had oceans, we don't know how
Venus rids itself of its internal heat, and we don't know if Venus
is still volcanically active,'' he said. ``Magellan's goal is to
answer these questions and improve on our knowledge of the
geophysical and geological properties of Venus and the nature of
processes that shape its surface.''
   Boyce said the images could help scientists understand how Earth
and its sister planet Venus evolved so differently, even though
they basically were identical when formed at the beginning of the
solar system.
   The surface temperature on Venus is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and
its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The
atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and a thick
cloud of sulfuric acid drops.
   John H. Gerpheide, Magellan project manager, said the $550
million Magellan mission will mark ``the beginning of a big year
for the planetary program.''
   ``In August the Voyager spacecraft will fly by Neptune and in
October we'll launch Galileo to Jupiter,'' he told reporters
Wednesday.
   ``So after an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're
anxious to get started,'' he said. ``We have our team in place .. .
and the butterflies are soon to arrive.''
   The last planetary mission launched by the United States was the
1978 Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will take
the first closeup look at distant Neptune in August after earlier
exploring Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
