   Two Soviet cosmonauts and a Bulgarian rocketed into
space Tuesday on the first manned flight of 1988, riding a column of
orange flame on live television, courtesy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and ``glasnost.''
   Alexander Alexandrov, 36, from the Bulgarian town of Omurtag, had
waited more than nine years for the flight. The Soyuz TM-5 space
capsule lifted off at 6:03 p.m. Moscow time (10:03 a.m. EDT) from
the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia.
   The broadcast on state television showed flames spewing from a
Vostok rocket booster to lift the capsule into a nearly cloudless
blue sky.
   ``I feel excellent,'' Alexandrov said from inside the capsule
seconds after the launch. The shot, in black and white, showed him
in cramped quarters.
   About two minutes into the flight, the first stage of the booster
dropped away and plummeted toward the earth.
   Before Gorbachev became the Soviet leader, with his ``glasnost''
policy of openness in selected areas, launches customarily were
broadcast only when successful and only on tape, after the fact.
   Tuesday's live coverage lasted more than an hour, and other media
also featured the story.
   Tass carrried 10 reports on the launch and the Soviet manned
space program. The Soviet program thrives, while U.S. manned flights
stalled after January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger, which killed seven astronauts.
   Several other Soviet manned missions are planned for this year,
including crew members from France and Afghanistan.
   During the broadcast Tuesday, Alexandrov's family was shown in
Bulgaria watching the launch on a television screen set up on a
street.
   ``I wish him a happy journey and a safe return, like any
mother,'' his mother told a television reporter minutes after the
launch.
   The broadcast showed cheering, waving crowds in the streets.
Bulgaria's defense minister was among the dignitaries watching at
Baikonur in the republic of Kazakhstan.
   Alexandrov and cosmonauts Viktor P. Savinykh, 48, and Anatoly Y.
Solovyov, 40, are scheduled to dock Thursday with the space station
Mir, whose name means Peace in Russian.
   Already aboard are cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov,
the last men to enter space. They reached the station Dec. 23.
   In a 10-day mission, the five men are to conduct about 40
experiments, some using Bulgarian equipment. Tass, the official news
agency, said they involve space physics, remote sensing of Earth,
space biology and medicine.
   Among items the new cosmonauts are taking to the Mir is an orchid
grown on Earth from seeds planted on the space station, the agency
said.
   Viktor A. Svirin, a shift director at the Soviet Mission Control
Center in Kaliningrad, northeast of Moscow, told reporters the Mir's
amenities include a a videocassette recorder with which the
cosmonauts can watch movies.
   The last Bulgarian-Soviet flight, in April 1979, was marred by a
failed attempt to dock with the Salyut space station. The Bulgarian
cosmonaut on that flight, Georgy Ivanov, told Soviet television this
time he had one wish for Alexandrov: that he only hear the word
``normal'' during his mission.
   Ivanov got his wish. Mission Control said repeatedly that all
systems on the Soyuz TM-5 were operating normally.
   Alexandrov was the backup Bulgarian for the 1979 mission. He had
trained for this flight since last year.
