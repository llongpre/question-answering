   The Soviet Union ended an era in its manned space
program Thursday when three cosmonauts returned to Earth, leaving
the Mir space station empty for the first time in more than two
years.
   A Soyuz TM-7 capsule carrying Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev
and Valery Polyakov landed about 90 miles northeast of Dzhezkazgan
in Soviet Central Asia, Tass said.
   The suspension of the Mir mission, the showpiece of the Soviet
space program, comes one day before the United States plans to
launch its Atlantis space shuttle with a crew of five.
   Mir, designed for permanent occupancy, will remain empty until
another rocket launch scheduled in August. Officials said the
respite will save money at a time when the Soviet Union is
struggling with a $160 billion deficit.
   Tass called the touchdown of the Soyuz capsule soft, but Volkov,
on the evening news program ``Vremya,'' called it ``not one of the
softest.''
   ``There was a double touchdown. The apparatus landed, then
jumped from the ground and we were turned over several times. In
general, the blows could be felt. Probably the bruises will
remain,'' Volkov said.
   Krikalev suffered the most because he hit a capsule control
panel, the TV reporter said without elaboration.
   In the TV report, Krikalev appeared to be the most shaken and
pale of the three cosmonauts, and Polyakov, a doctor, was shown
treating him aboard a plane flight to Star City near Moscow.
   There was no explanation what went wrong or why Tass said the
landing was soft.
   Volkov and Krikalev had been in space for five months. Polyakov
remained aboard Mir for eight months after a joint Afghan-Soviet
flight to study the effects of long-term space flight on the crew.
   A replacement crew was orginally due to arrive at the Mir
station April 19 to keep the station manned, but Tass said ``a
delay with the preparation of the new modules forced a revision of
the plan.''
   The respite will allow scientists a chance to review scientific
data, complete work on two unfinished station modules and give
ground controllers vacations, space officials said last week.
   In August, cosmonauts will return to Mir for a six-month stint
that will include overseeing the addition of a new research module
and a service module, officials said. The additions will double the
space station's weight to 100 tons, Tass said.
   Since its launch in 1986, Mir has been home to four resident
crews, including the record-breaking yearlong stay by cosmonauts
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, who returned to Earth in December.
   Cosmonaut Vladimir Gzhenebekov told Soviet TV the landing
required ``little corrections,'' but there were no major problems
like those that cropped up during the last two landings.
   In September, an Afghan and Soviet cosmonaut were forced to
postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule in Soviet Central
Asia for a day because of equipment problems and crew errors. They
touched down safely a day late, but were running dangerously low on
food and air.
   During the return of Titov and Manarov in December, the
cosmonauts had to spend an additional three hours orbiting Earth in
their descent module because of a computer problem, the Soviet
media reported.
