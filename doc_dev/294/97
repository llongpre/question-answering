   The safe landing of two cosmonauts after two
aborted attempts comes during a busy year for the Soviet manned
space program, with cosmonauts seeking to break their own country's
endurance record in an orbiting station.
   The Soviet Union inaugurated manned spaceflight in 1961 and has
since gained the confidence to televise launches and landings live
and invite foreigners to climb aboard for a ride, as it did with
the Afghan cosmonaut who returned to Earth today.
   But the tense ordeal of the Afghan-Soviet crew reminded the
Soviets of the dangers of space flight in a similar, if less
tragic, way that the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in
January 1986 sobered U.S. space officials.
   ``We are already used to everything going smoothly in space,''
commentator Alexander Tikhomirov told Soviet viewers in a prime
time television newscast. ``And some forget about the danger which
space research entails. And here, this once more convinces us how
complex a matter it is and what a huge amount of abnormal
situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit.''
   Whether the problems with the latest mission, in which
malfunctions trapped the the two cosmonauts in orbit as food and
oxygen dwindled, will delay the next ventures in the Soviet program
is unclear.
   Those ventures include a Nov. 21 blastoff by a Soviet-French
crew for a monthlong mission, a 1990 voyage with an Austrian crew
member and a later mission with a Malaysian crew member.
   The most enduring symbol of Soviet commitment to manned
spaceflight has been the orbiting Mir space station. The research
complex, launched in February 1986, is planned as a permanently
manned fixture in space.
   Two cosmonauts have been aboard Mir since Dec. 21 and plan to
break the 326-day space endurance record set by Yuri Romanenko
aboard Mir last year. In June, a Soviet-Bulgarian crew spent 10
days in space, including a visit to Mir. Soviet officials also have
indicated they will launch their own space shuttle, unmanned, by
year's end. They have emphasized the shuttle will not be flown
manned until it is proven safe.
   The candor with which the Soviets informed the world of the
plight of their temporarily stranded crew showed how treatment of
the space program has changed under Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. It was a far cry from the secrecy in which missions were
veiled starting with the Oct. 4, 1957, launch of the first
satellite, Sputnik.
   Since Yuri Gagarin blasted off as the first man in space in
1961, manned launches have become routine. Soviet officials now
show launches and in some cases landings on live television and
invite foreigners to watch the blastoffs. The first live TV
coverage of a Soviet manned space launch was the Apollo-Soyuz
mission in 1975. The first launch to be shown live of an
all-Russian crew was in 1984.
   Space has also served political purposes for the Soviet Union.
Prior to the Afghan mission, the Soviets had 13 ``guest
cosmonauts'' aboard their spacecraft in flights that serve to show
off their scientific prowess and promote friendly ties with other
countries.
   As U.S. officials still grapple with the tragic deaths of the
seven Challenger crew members, the Soviets have to think back 17
years to their last fatal space disaster.
   Three cosmonauts docked with the Salyut 1 space station, and
then during re-entry on June 30, 1971, air leaked out of their
capsule and they suffocated.
   The first and only other fatality in a Soviet space flight was
Vladimir Komarov. His Soyuz 1 capsule crash landed April 24, 1967,
but Soviet officials never explained what exactly went wrong.
   Western space experts believe six to eight other cosmonauts died
in training accidents on the ground from 1960-1975.
