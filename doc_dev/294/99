   Two cosmonauts took a walk in space Tuesday to try
to repair a thermal blanket that has partially ripped apart and
could interfere with their safe return to Earth, Soviet media
reported.
   Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin opened the
hatch of the Mir space station as the orbiting spacecraft entered
the shadow of the Earth, Radio Moscow reported.
   They moved along the outside of the station to their Soyuz TM-9
capsule, which is docked to the Mir, to inspect and make decisions
on whether they could repair the thermal insulation, the radio
report said.
   ``According to the results we have gotten so far ... we can
almost definitely state that it (the thermal insulation problem)
will not affect the landing,'' Vladimir A. Solovyev, a former
cosmonaut and the flight controller, said in a live report from
Baikonur Space Center on the evening news program ``Vremya.''
   He said the landing would take place on Aug. 9, as scheduled.
   The cosmonauts experienced some delays during their space walk,
but caught up to their schedule and the time spent on the walk
would total more than 4{ hours, the controller reported.
   There were no further reports immediately in the Soviet media on
whether they actually repaired the thermal insulation or other
results of their space walk.
   ``Vremya'' showed a fuzzy picture of the spacecraft, with what
appeared to be flapping thermal insulation. Part of the insulation
has been flapping uselessly for months.
   Earlier Tuesday, a correspondent for ``Vremya'' displayed some
of the tools the cosmonauts would use, including what looked liked
a large pair of shears.
   Soviet officials extended the cosmonauts' flight until Aug. 9 to
give them extra time to make the repairs, Soviet newspapers
reported last month. They had been scheduled to return July 30
after nearly six months in space.
   It was the latest in a series of problems in the Soviet Union's
manned space program, which for decades has been a source of
national pride. For the past two years, the program has been
plagued by docking equipment malfunctions, human error and budget
cuts.
   Soviet officials have minimized the danger, saying the capsule
could withstand such damage to its thermal blanket, the newsaper
Izvestia reported. James Oberg, an American specialist on the
Soviet space program, agreed.
   ``I don't think there's danger. I think there's anxiety over
something more going wrong,'' Oberg said last month in an interview.
   Nearly half the thermal blanket has separated from the capsule
and a 6{-foot-long section is hanging off, attached only on one
side, the newspaper Trud reported. The damage probably occurred
during launch of the capsule Feb. 11 when a ground rescue structure
scratched the thermal blanket, according to deputy flight director
Viktor Blagov.
   The American magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology
reported May 21 that because of the damage, the Soyuz spacecraft
had cooled and moisture built up inside. Izvestia said temperature
changes could damage equipment needed for re-entry.
   The space station is being turned twice daily to keep the
damaged section in the sunlight so it stays warm, and hot air is
being pumped from Mir into the capsule to prevent a moisture
buildup, Izvestia said.
   But Izvestia also said part of the ripped shield is blocking an
infrared sensor used for navigation, meaning a manually controlled
landing might be necessary. In addition, Izvestia said, the ripped
section might catch on an antenna attached to the Mir as the Soyuz
capsule undocks.
   Oberg said there was little threat the capsule would burn up
during its re-entry into the atmosphere because the thermal
blankets are separate from the shield used to protect the craft in
that phase of the flight.
   A new crew is scheduled to be launched Aug. 1 to occupy Mir
after Solovyev and Balandin leave.
