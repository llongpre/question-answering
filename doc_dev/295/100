   NEW YORK -- The coup of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
has pressed the news divisions of the three major broadcast
networks and CNN into action -- just as they had hoped to
recover from the financial jolt of covering the Persian Gulf
War.
   ABC News, CBS News and NBC News have already far exceeded
their annual budgets of approximately $250 million apiece
because of the Gulf war. Each news division has cut staff and
is looking for ways to save money, closing bureaus and
forging newly expanded partnerships with foreign news
agencies.

   NBC alone has estimated the expense of covering the war
and related advertising pullouts at about $55 million. The
network news units hope to hold down costs as they set about
covering the developments in the Soviet Union.
   Don Browne, executive vice president of NBC News, a
division of General Electric Co.'s NBC unit, said he hopes to
capitalize on news-gathering partnerships with British
Broadcasting Corp. and Visnews, in which NBC owns a 38%
stake. "We share facilities and crews with the BBC and
Visnews, so it isn't inconceivable that someone watching NBC
could see a BBC correspondent," said Mr. Browne, who claims
the partnership could make NBC's coverage "three times as
strong."
   Similarly, CBS News, a division of CBS Inc., said it was
sharing video with Tokyo Broadcasting System Inc. in covering
the Soviet events.
   ABC News said it won't rely on foreign partners. "We have
four crews in the streets and a large bureau already in
place," said Robert Murphy, an ABC News vice president.
   The networks aren't planning on airing hours upon hours of
coverage of the Gorbachev story. For example, the networks
haven't scheduled specials that will preempt prime-time
shows, thereby avoiding the loss of advertising revenue.
Commercials typically are sold at a discount or are
eliminated entirely during crisis coverage.
   But network officials insisted the coverage plans aren't
dictated by economic factors. "The story is settling down, so
it could be covered calmly and without crashing on the air,"
said Lane Venardos, director of special events at CBS News.
   Some extended coverage already has been offered. ABC News
last night broadcast a special one-hour edition of "World
News Tonight with Peter Jennings," which usually runs 30
minutes. Affiliates of ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC
Inc., had the option of bailing out after a half-hour. CBS
News planned to air a special at 11:30 p.m., NBC at 10:30
p.m., but ABC News was going to wait until the network's
"Monday Night Football" was over.
   In the first hours after the unexpected toppling of Mr.
Gorbachev late Sunday, Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s CNN
cable channel went to continuous coverage. CBS News, which
usually airs a 15-minute newscast at 11 p.m. EDT and airs a
duplicate show for other affiliates at 11:30 p.m., added
coverage of the Gorbachev crisis in the later broadcast. ABC
News did the same, while NBC News broke in with a bulletin
shortly after midnight EDT.
   Ed Turner, CNN executive vice president, said the Soviet
story doesn't "appear to be an economic hardship" for the
four news units. "But that could change," he cautioned. "If
there is civil war, if we have to go out to the countryside,
all that could send the bills soaring."
   All four network news divisions said the costs could
plummet if the American press contingent is removed entirely
or is prohibited from reporting. "Don't forget," said CBS's
Mr. Venardos, "the Soviets are holding down costs because
they won't let us in. It's not like we can have an endless
supply of visas. You can't just suddenly decide to send 50
people over there with no problem."
