   ATLANTA -- The U.S. has gotten over its "CNN Syndrome,"
unfortunately for CNN.
   Cable News Network, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., had expected to retain permanent ratings gains of as
much as 40% after the Persian Gulf war. But as images of
returning U.S. troops were replaced by images of escaping
Kurds, viewers tuned out.

   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings released by CNN, the
network's April viewership levels are back to pre-war levels:
an average 24-hour rating of 0.7% of its 62.4 million
households. That compares with average ratings of 3.3 in
February and 1.9 in March.
   Turner officials say they're still pleased with the
exposure CNN got through its acclaimed war coverage and say
it will boost the network's nascent efforts overseas.
   Turner Broadcasting is trying to expand CNN's reach in
other ways. The company announced it will test an Airport
Channel this summer, with CNN-produced news, consumer and
travel features beamed via satellite to airport departure
gates. Turner also said it is pushing ahead with the Checkout
Channel, in which CNN-produced newscasts greet shoppers at
supermarket checkout lines.
   The Airport Channel is expected to generate $20 million in
revenue by 1994; the Checkout Channel, $100 million by 1993.
