   Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network is in the late stages of negotiations to provide Telemundo Group Inc., a Spanish-language network, with a national nightly newscast in Spanish. 

   If a final agreement is reached, CNN would be the first major English-language television programmer to provide such Spanish-language news programming. 
The agreement also would open the door to the booming market for Hispanic programming to Turner Broadcasting. 
A spokesman for that broadcasting concern confirmed the talks, but declined to comment further. 

   The negotiations have drawn criticism, however, from the Hispanic broadcasters who currently provide New York-based Telemundo with its news programming. 
They accuse Telemundo of trying to get cheaper news programming at the expense of developing Hispanic participation in broadcasting. 

   Henry R. Silverman, Telemundo's president and chief executive officer, said: "If we go with CNN it would be because, in my opinion, it is the pre-eminent electronic news-gathering organization in the world." 

   Mr. Silverman said CNN has proposed "piggybacking" its Spanish-language news production efforts on its 20 domestic and overseas news bureaus. 
He said that it's not a question of reducing the $3.6 million Telemundo paid last year to Latino-owned Hispanic-American Broadcasting Corp. in Miami to produce the newscasts. 
"We don't know if it will be cheaper. 
We may spend the same amount of money and get something better." 

   He added that Hispanic-American Broadcasting would be asked to provide what he described as "soft news" and entertainment features comparable to Entertainment Tonight or Solid Gold, a pop music variety show. 

   For CNN, the talks hold the promise of a new programming outlet without a significant investment, an important consideration for cash-strapped Turner Broadcasting. 
It would also fit with the aim for broad cross-cultural dissemination of CNN, which already is broadcast internationally. 

   Hispanic broadcasting is a high-growth market with plenty of room for further growth. 
Although about 8% of the population is of Hispanic descent, less than 1% of advertising dollars is spent on marketing directly to Hispanics, said Telemundo's Mr. Silverman. 
Even so, combined advertising revenues last year rose 35% to 40% for the nation's two Spanish-language networks -- Telemundo and Univision, which is owned by Hallmark Cards Inc., Kansas City, Mo. 

   Pedro Sevcec, news director for Hispanic-American Broadcasting, called the Telemundo-CNN negotiations part of a "shameful process," and questioned CNN's expertise in covering Latino and Latin American issues. 
Telemundo "is changing from Hispanic newscasting to having the news read in Spanish. 
There's a difference."
