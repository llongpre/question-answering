   Cable News Network today handed over to a federal
judge tapes of Manuel Noriega talking on the telephone from his
prison cell.
   After receiving the tapes from a team of CNN lawyers, U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler gave them to federal Magistrate
William C. Turnoff.
   CNN unsuccessfully appealed Hoeveler's earlier temporary order
barring the network from airing the tapes. Some of the tapes were
broadcast before an appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
the order.
   Hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal
magistrate so that Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's
drug-trafficking trial, is not ``tainted'' by any disclosures about
Noriega's defense strategy.
   Noriega's attorneys claim the tapes disclose defense maneuvers
and have damaged the deposed Panamanian dictator's chances for a
fair trial.
   Hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and
translated from Spanish, then would be studied by Turnoff. Hoeveler
said he didn't know how long that would take.
   The tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage
Noriega's right to a fair trial. If the judge then orders a
permanent ban on further broadcasts, CNN can again appeal,
eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are confident that when Magistrate Turnoff reviews these
tapes and reports to the judge, CNN will be found not to have
violated the court order,'' said Steven Korn, lawyer for Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., CNN's owner.
   Korn said the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   On Monday, a Noriega attorney, Jon May, also said he would ask
for an immediate contempt hearing aimed at forcing CNN to pay fines
of up to $300,000 for each violation of the judge's order. He said
he would ask the all-news network for a log of how many times it
aired the tapes.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that General Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said of his proposal that fines against CNN be used for
Noriega's attorneys.
   CNN's attorney said the network doesn't expect to pay any fines.
He said that the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   The fines could help solve another problem plaguing the defense
- a freeze on Noriega's bank accounts that has kept him from paying
his lawyers.
   The private attorneys have said they cannot stay on the case
without some money. Hoeveler said last week he would decide soon
whether to give Noriega government-paid counsel instead.
   The dispute over the tapes has raised questions about
attorney-client confidentiality, the right to a fair trial and the
First Amendment.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.
