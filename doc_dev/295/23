   CNN attorneys on Tuesday handed a federal
magistrate a briefcase filled with tapes of Manuel Noriega's
telephone calls, saying they were confident the recordings would
show his rights were never violated.
   The network acted in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's
weekend refusal to lift the trial judge's order that CNN cease
broadcasting the tapes, and surrender them to determine if their
use invaded Noriega's attorney-client right to confidentiality.
   ``We hope and are confident that the court will conclude that
the prior restraint is not appropriate under these circumstances,''
said Steven Korn, chief counsel to CNN's parent company, Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. ``CNN believes ... that the conversations
that were telecast were not attorney-client privileged
conversations.''
   CNN surrendered the tapes to U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler in his chambers, but the judge said he did not want to
hear any potentially privileged conversations. He ordered them
given to U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff, who will make and study
transcripts and report his conclusions back to the Hoeveler, the
judge assigned to hear Noriega's drug-smuggling trial.
   No time limit was set, but Noriega's lead attorney Frank Rubino
said the judge guaranteed it would done ``with dispatch.'' It was
not known if the lawyers would be called in to consult with the
magistrate, or if a hearing would be held when his report was
issued, said Rubino.
   Korn refused to say how many tapes were handed over, or to
describe their contents or origins. He said the recordings
presented Tuesday were copies, not originals.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with privileged matters -
in part because Rubino tacitly agreed to broadcasting them when he
identified them on the air.
   But Rubino, who asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against
CNN, strongly disagreed, although he acknowledged he does not know
the contents of most of the tapes.
   ``There are numerous conversations with the general wherein ...
defense strategies were discussed, witnesses were discussed, and
things of that nature,'' Rubino said. ``We assume that to be what's
on the tape.''
   Hoeveler refused to set an immediate contempt hearing against
CNN. He said he must await a decision by Chief U.S. District Judge
James Lawence King on a motion by CNN asking that the trial judge
be removed from the tapes case.
   Rubino has subpoenaed CNN to produce a log of how many times the
network and its affiliates telecast a tape between Noriega and his
defense team.
   Noriega is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center. Prison officials routinely tape prisoners' phone
conversations for security reasons, unless the inmate indicates
beforehand that he is talking wiuth his attorney.
   The FBI is investigating how the tapes were leaked.
   Noriega co-counsel Jon May noted that the defense has asked for
contempt penalties of $300,000 per airing, and said one estimate of
damages was $12 million. That money should go to the cash-strapped
defense, he said.
   ``There is ample precedent for a court to direct a fine to one
of the parties,'' May said. ``And we are certainly, we believe, the
party most injured by CNN's actions, and ... would have the
greatest claim.''
   Hoeveler is considering whether to replace Rubino and May with
government-paid counsel. The judge had not announced a decision by
Tuesday.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator is jailed outside of Miami on
charges of taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial
isn't expected to begin before the spring.
