   As communications between each of the three major U.S.
broadcast networks and their correspondents in Baghdad were
cut off within the first few minutes after war against Iraq
began last night, only the all-news Cable News Network was
somehow able to maintain contact with its three-member team.
   The extraordinary performance by the crew of Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. was underscored when NBC News
anchor Tom Brokaw interviewed the CNN correspondents,
including a rival anchor, Bernard Shaw, and reporters Peter
Arnett and John Holliman.

   At the conclusion of the brief interview, Mr. Brokaw asked
Mr. Shaw how it was that CNN had telephone contact, while the
other three networks lost touch almost immediately. After a
lengthy pause, Mr. Shaw said he would have to "pass" on
answering. "I'll explain it the next time I see you,
profusely," Mr. Shaw said.
   In Washington, when reporters asked Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney last night what was happening in Iraq, the secretary
replied with a smile that the best information he had about
Baghdad came from CNN.
   CNN is seen live in Baghdad. CNN officials couldn't be
reached to comment on how the network kept its telephone line
open. According to the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings service,
CNN's overnight ratings from 25 major cities jumped an
astounding 271% Tuesday evening, compared with the same night
a week earlier.
   The three major networks instantly switched to previously
announced plans to broadcast round-the-clock coverage of the
war in the Persian Gulf. Only the ABC network, a unit of New
York-based Capital Cities/ABC Inc., broke for commericals,
twice in the first two hours of the coverage.
