   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it is seeking to sell about $150 million of preferred stock in its Cable News Network Inc. subsidiary. 

   Proceeds from the private placement would be used to pay the company's extendable notes, its most expensive form of debt, which carries a current interest rate of 17% and that rises half a percentage point each quarter. 
The dividends to be paid on the new stock would be much less expensive for the company, though company officials declined to say exactly how much less. 

   "It's making use of the most valuable part of the company to get a better rate," said Richard Bilotti, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 

   CNN's value stems from steadily climbing viewership and profitability. 
In the 1988 first quarter, Turner Broadcasting's cable productions segment -- of which CNN is the centerpiece -- posted a 37% increase in operating income on a 33% gain in revenue. 
In addition, the unit isn't currently encumbered with debt, which is all carried by the parent company. 
Turner Broadcasting has about $1.4 billion of debt. 

   Turner Broadcasting's board approved Friday the creation of this new class of stock, which is being marketed to institutional investors by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
The stock isn't seen as posing a competitive threat to New York-based Time Inc., one of Turner Broadcasting's major shareholders, which has an option to take over CNN if company chairman and chief executive officer Ted Turner ever cedes voting control of the company. 

   Under the proposed terms of the CNN preferred, which would have no voting power, dividends on the stock would accrue quarterly over a three-year period. 
Under certain circumstances, these shares could be convertible to Turner Broadcasting Class B common stock. 

   Separately, Turner Broadcasting shareholders approved an amendment at the annual meeting Friday that allows the company to pay dividends to its cable investors over the next three years in Class B stock rather than cash. 
The cable group struck the deal to save the company cash, while increasing its ownership position from the current level of 37%. 

   That agreement and the new CNN preferred represent incremental steps the company is taking to ease its debt burden, at a time when a total refinancing isn't possible. 
In addition, Mr. Turner told holders, efforts to sell the CNN Center headquarters complex are continuing.
