   Teachers and school administrators got their
first look Monday at Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s daily news
show for use in the classroom, a commercial-free alternative to the
sponsored news program that Whittle Communications plans to launch
next spring.
   Turner is calling its program CNN Newsroom and it will be carried
weekdays at 3:45 a.m. EDT on Cable News Network.
   The pre-dawn telecast is designed to enable teachers to tape the
program and review it to see if all or part could be used in class
later that day.
   The program was launched well before the new school year begins
to give teachers and administrators a chance to determine if it fits
with their lesson plans. Turner also gets a jump of several months
on Whittle's ad-supported Channel One news program that begins
nationally in March.
   With the notable exception of commercials, the first 15-minute
edition of CNN Newsroom resembled the 12-minute Channel One programs
that Whittle Communications tested over a seven-week period in six
schools last spring.
   Both programs are anchored by a youthful and demographically
balanced team. The CNN Newsroom anchors are Cassandra Henderson and
Brian Todd, Turner Broadcasting employees selected from a group of
more than 250 applicants.
   The programs open with news headlines, contain filmed news
footage, make liberal use of maps and carry several feature stories
chosen and developed to appeal to teenagers.
   CNN Newsroom had an expanded feature on the career of Rep. Mickey
Leland, the Texas Democrat who was killed in an airplane crash in
Ethiopia.
   It also had a feature on a Georgia high school teacher who gives
his students practical experience in using the English language by
having them research, write and edit stories for a folklore magazine
he publishes.
   And it had a feature on Chinese students who have found they must
sit through lessons taught by the army in the aftermath of the
bloody suppression of a student uprising this summer in Beijing.
   During its test run earlier this year, Channel One had features
on the life of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and series
that dealt with the environment and life in Russia for teenagers.
   The services are delivered differently.
   CNN Newsroom arrives by cable or is taped off television at home,
while Channel One is delivered by satellite.
   Atlanta-based Turner said it has endorsements or pledges of
support from cable operators representing nearly 50 percent of the
cable television hosueholds in the United States to deliver the
program to schools.
   Turner is paying the entire bill for producing the show and
providing a teacher's guide by electronic mail to help in using the
program in class.
   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., is providing both the program
and delivery by using advertising revenue.
   Whittle said only a fraction of the nation's classrooms are
individually equipped with TV sets and that without them, teachers
are unable to make the best use possible of the daily news service
and other television programs.
   Channel One schools get an average of $50,000 in video hardware,
including TV sets, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes in
exchange for allowing Whittle to sell two minutes of commercials in
each 12-minute news program to advertisers. During the test,
companies pitched candy bars, deodorant and jeans to the
tough-to-reach teen audience.
   Several national education groups have blasted Whittle for taking
unfair advantage of students who are required to be in school and
may find it difficult to avoid the commercials.
   New York education officials have prohibited public schools in
that state from subscribing to Channel One and the top educational
officer in California has said any school in his state that takes it
risks losing state aid.
   Nonetheless, Whittle hopes to sign up 8,000 schools for Channel
One by the start of the 1990-91 school year. Turner expects teachers
in about 1,000 schools will use CNN Newsroom when school starts in
the next few weeks.
