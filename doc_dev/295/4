When the earthquake struck San Francisco, the major TV networks scrambled to 
air dramatic video of the disaster, relying to an unusual degree on the 
reporting of local stations to get out the first pictures from an area that 
lost phone lines, power and light. 
</P>
<P>
At times during the networks' many hours of coverage, they "cut in" to their 
San Francisco affiliates' local newscasts, giving national viewers an unedited 
look at the San Francisco news. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unusual to cut in to the local newscasts as much as we did," Ted 
Koppel, who anchored nearly five hours of coverage throughout the night for 
ABC, said Wednesday. "We were flying on their power to a large extent." 
</P>
<P>
Power literally was the problem for NBC. While ABC, CBS and CNN were able to 
begin lengthy coverage of the earthquake shortly after the quake hit at 5:04 
p.m. PDT, NBC lagged behind because the network's affiliate, KRON, had lost 
power on its generator and didn't have a backup at hand. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing the quake at 5:31 p.m., NBC went on the air at 5:58 p.m. with 
the first of a series of reports anchored by Mary Alice Williams. The updates, 
which ran several minutes each, continued until 6:43 p.m., when Tom Brokaw 
began continuous coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning reports, we stayed on as long as we could with the 
information and material we could get," said Don Browne, executive news 
director of NBC News. "Your affiliate is your link, and we literally couldn't 
reach them at first because of their technical problems." 
</P>
<P>
Once KRON was able to get video and reporting out to NBC, said Browne, "NBC was 
able to make a strong stretch run." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Cable News Network was able to get footage from KRON before NBC 
did. CNN was able to pick up the local broadcast of KRON, a CNN affiliate, and 
send it via satellite to CNN's headquarters in Atlanta. CNN broadcast video 
from KRON at 6:42 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
NBC confirmed Wednesday that CNN had been able to get on the air with the 
footage sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN did have KRON's material sooner because KRON was beaming up on the 
satellite," said NBC News spokesman Catherine McQuay. "NBC got the signal 
through an uplink through KCRA, the NBC affiliate in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
ABC -- which was beginning its broadcast of the World Series game from San 
Francisco when the earthquake struck -- had the competitive advantage in its 
coverage. Koppel, who went on the air from Washington D.C. at 5:23 p.m. 
following a brief announcement at 5:10 p.m., interviewed ABC sportcaster Al 
Michaels live from Candlestick Park and was able to show aerial shots from the 
Goodyear blimp, in addition to footage throughout the night from KGO-TV, the 
network's San Francisco affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
At CBS, Dan Rather went on the air with a bulletin that the earthquake had hit 
at 5:21 p.m. With pictures from CBS affiliate KPIX, the network began 
continuous coverage at 5:55 p.m.
