   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it has sued the
Treasury Department in a bid to force the U.S. to allow
Turner to sell news and entertainment programming in Cuba.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., comes two weeks after the Treasury
Department turned down Turner's request for a license on the
grounds that selling satellite programming would be "contrary
to United States government foreign policy."

   The federal Trading With the Enemy Act prohibits most U.S.
trade with Cuba, but Congress passed a law in 1988 exempting
informational materials. Bert Carp, Turner's vice president
of government affairs, said the government is arguing that
satellite transmissions are still covered by the Cuban trade
embargo. Mr. Carp said Turner is arguing that satellite
transmissions should be treated the same way as videotapes,
which can be sold in Cuba.
   The Treasury Department declined comment on the suit
yesterday.
   Turner, based in Atlanta, is seeking permission to sell
CNN International and TNT South in 13 Cuban hotels. CNN
International is an English-language version of Cable News
Network, geared toward an international audience, while TNT
South contains movies, syndicated programs and other
entertainment, translated into Spanish and Portuguese.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control
allows Turner to exchange news transmissions with Cuba. In
that arrangement, Turner pulls Cuban news feeds from a Soviet
satellite, and Cuba pulls unscrambled CNN feeds off an
American satellite.
   In a letter last month to Turner officials, R. Richard
Newcomb, director of the office of foreign assets control,
said the new request is a "substantially different
arrangement" and that providing TNT South in hotels would
"result in the enhancement of Cuba's tourist industry,
contrary to the objectives of the embargo."
   A similar case was decided in the government's favor last
year. Capital Cities/ABC Inc. had sued the Treasury
Department for permission to broadcast the Pan American
Games, held in Cuba this summer. The network had agreed to
pay $8.7 million for the broadcast rights to the games. A
judge ruled that constitutional concerns about free speech
were outweighed by the executive branch's right to conduct
foreign policy, and agreed with the Treasury Department's
decision that the games could be aired only if Cuba received
no payment. The network reached a settlement with the U.S.
government that allowed the network -- in cooperation with
Turner -- to air the games.
