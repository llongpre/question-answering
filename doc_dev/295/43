   Contempt fines levied against CNN should be used to
pay for Manuel Noriega's defense against drug smuggling charges, an
attorney for the deposed Panamanian dictator said Monday.
   On Sunday, the U.S. Supreme Court left intact a federal judge's
temporary order that barred CNN from airing tapes of jailhouse
phone conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
contempt of court hearing against CNN in view of the U.S. Supreme
Court's 7-2 decision.
   The defense has asked for fines of $300,000 per airing of the
conversations, and May said it will ask that money be used for a
Noriega defense trust fund.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that GEneral Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said.
   That could allow NOriega to keep his private defense team even
though his funds have been frozen by federal prosecutors and
foreign governments.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said last week he would
decide soon whether to replace Noriega's private attorneys with
government-paid counsel. The private attorneys have said they
cannot stay on the case without some money.
   STeven Korn, chief counsel for CNN's parent company Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., said the network had no position on how
any fines it might pay should be dispersed because it doesn't
Expect to pay any.
   He said the network never aired privileged conversations under
Hoeveler's order.
   ``I think that point has been lost in the hue and cry,'' Korn
said. He noted that lead Noriega attorney Frank Rubino had
identified and described the conversation on the air, and even
pushed the button on the tape recorder.
   Hoeveler, meanwhile, has set a hearing for Tuesday on how to
proceed with the prison tapes at the center of the CNN-Noriega
dispute.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday the tapes were being
Blown out of proportion.
   ``This is not as grand an issue as it is described as being,''
Lehtinen said. ``I think the taping by the government will be found
to be quite correct. Privileged conversations ... are not
privileged when you get on a phone from a prison, and you know it
is being taped.''
   He said the judge may well rule the tapes are not prejudicial to
Noriega's case.
   May said that such a ruling would neither keep Hoeveler from
Finding CNN in contempt, nor end the gag order.
between attorneys and a client,'' May said.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct, but Hoeveler has not ruled on the issue.
   Noriega is jailed outside of MIami on a drug-trafficking
indictment accusing him of accepting bribes to turn Panama into a
way station for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He has been held more
than 10 months and his trial isn't expected to begin before next
spring.
