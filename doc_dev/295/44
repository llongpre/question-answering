   Cable News Network has reached an agreement to
use a Soviet satellite to blanket the world with CNN's signal.
   The satellite signal will cover an area from South Africa to
Norway and from Hong Kong to the Azores Islands off Portugal's
coast, boosting the cable channel's potential audience to 58
million households, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said Wednesday.
   CNN, part of Turner Broadcasting System, will use the Statsionar
12 satellite positioned over the Indian Ocean, complementing
satellites that broadcast the network to South America, Europe and
western Asia, he said.
   The signal will be beamed from Atlanta to a satellite over the
Atlantic Ocean, relayed down to Moscow and up to Statsionar 12.
   Haworth said CNN also is working on a deal to have its signal
broadcast for widespread use in Moscow, where currently it is
``only watched by the Soviet Television Authority, (Soviet
President) Mikhail Gorbachev and probably someone in the Kremlin.''
