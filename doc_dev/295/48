   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said its board decided against replacing the company's CNN Headline News service with a financial news service. 

   The proposal to replace Headline News with financial news during weekday business hours would have put Turner Broadcasting in direct competition on cable television with Financial News Network. 

   The board voted against "wholesale changes" in Headline News, a Turner Broadcasting spokesman said. 
Instead, the cable-television concern will explore ways to increase business news coverage on one, or both, of its news channels, he added. 

   Turner Broadcasting declined to elaborate on the decision by the newly constituted board, which now has seven of 15 members that represent cable-TV-system operators. 
Such decisions require approval by 12 members. 
The operators hold a 37% stake in the company. 

   Turner Broadcasting said an idea for another entertainment network, which would use films from its MGM library as its centerpiece, is still under consideration. 

   Turner Broadcasting owns the 24-hour Cable News Network and the WTBS television station, which is also carried on cable TV. CNN Headline News airs general news in half-hour cycles 24 hours a day. 
Headline News reaches approximately 26 million homes, or about 30% of all U.S. households and roughly 60% of those with cable TV.
