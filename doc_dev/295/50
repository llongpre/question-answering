   ATLANTA -- Cable News Network, whose ratings ballooned in
January and February, lost more than half its viewership last
week as Americans began to turn their attention away from the
Persian Gulf.
   The fast drop threatened, but didn't dash, the 24-hour
news network's hopes of getting permanent benefits from its
war coverage.

   CNN, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., had an
average rating of 3.3% of its 56.8 million households during
February, almost five times higher than in 1990, according to
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings provided by CNN. But the number fell
steadily after Iraq capitulated to allied forces, dropping to
1.5 by Thursday.
   Officials at CNN said the decline in viewership last week
wasn't surprising, and the network still expects ratings to
settle at a figure about 30% to 40% above its normal average
of about 0.7.
   Last week, the network shook up its anchor schedule and
added more weekend sports and news updates in an effort to
hold viewers. CNN is also putting together new commercials to
persuade viewers to keep watching.
   CNN officials expected viewership to rise again over the
weekend with live coverage of troop homecomings. (Ratings for
the last three days aren't yet available.)
