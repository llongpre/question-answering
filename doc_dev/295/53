   Cable News Network plans to launch an assault on
the three major broadcast networks next month with an hour-long
dinner-time newscast.
   CNN, which went after the big three TV networks in 1980 with
round-the-clock news, will begin airing the newscast from 6 p.m.-7
p.m. EDT on Oct. 16.
   Because the network's newscasts are carried live in each time
zone, the program would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast.
   Currently, CNN runs ``Newswatch'' from 5-6:30 p.m. EDT and shows
the entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30 p.m. CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said the new plan calls for ``Show Biz
Today'' to air at 5:30 p.m. EDT and ``Newswatch'' to run from 5-5:30
p.m. EDT.
   Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge Catherine
Crier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co-anchor
the new program was premature.
   ``We won't know anything about that until she actually joins
us,'' he said. ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When
she comes up with us and starts doing some training, we'll start
figuring what anchor role she'll be playing with us.''
   Haworth said the program would be designed to ``go head-to-head
with the networks,'' which broadcast a half-hour of news at 6:30
p.m. _ or 7 p.m. in some markets.
   CNN, which started in June 1980, has sports, commentary, talk and
specialty shows. But most of its 24-hour schedule is updated news
presentations.
