<TEXT>     The Airport Channel is similar to TBS's Checkout Channel, a television
service culled from the Cable News Network and CNN Headline News that is
designed to be shown to people waiting in line at grocery stores.;    "We
believe this network will provide an invaluable service to air travelers all
over the country by keeping them entertained and informed of the latest
events," CNN President Tom Johnson said in a statement.;    The channel will
be broadcast on televisions in airline terminals. So far, TBS said, American,
Delta and United airlines have signed up to receive the channel.;    If
testing is successful, telecasts from CNN headquarters in Atlanta will be
transmitted live to each of the nation's airports by late 1991, the
announcement said. The channel is expected to generate revenues of $20 million
by 1994.  </TEXT>
