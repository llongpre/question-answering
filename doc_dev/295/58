   ABC News, seeking new overseas markets for its
programs, said Wednesday it has been showing European broadcasters
``Nightline'' and will do the same with four more programs,
including ``World News Tonight.''
   The programs are being sent via satellite to cable and TV
companies in 23 countries in Western and Eastern Europe, including
Rupert Murdoch's new Sky Television direct broadcast satellite
based in London, ABC said.
   Once the European television officials have had a chance to look
at ABC's programs, the network's executives will hold discussions
with the companies interested in carrying the programs, an ABC News
spokesman said.
   The evening newscasts of NBC and CBS and ABC's ``Nightline''
already are carried in some overseas markets, including Japan.
   However, the top-rated ``World News Tonight'' isn't yet
broadcast overseas, said the ABC spokesman, Scott Richardson.
   The new satellite transmission of ``Nightline'' to European
broadcasters began on July 2. The other four programs will be shown
during the next few months, but no schedule for their transmission
has been set yet.
   In addition to ``World News Tonight,'' the programs are ``This
Week with David Brinkley,'' ``The Health Show'' and ``Business
World.''
   ABC's move is the latest of recent efforts by all three U.S.
network news divisions to find new markets and revenues at a time
the networks are losing audiences to cable and other viewing
alternatives.
   According to CBS, Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' is seen in
France, Italy and Japan. Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News'' is
carried in Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom
and Spain, NBC says.
   In addition to Japan, ABC's ``Nightline'' is carried by
broadcasters in New Zealand and Australia, and talks are underway
to have it shown in Italy and in Taiwan, according to a spokeswoman
for the program.
   Ted Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network, an early entry in the
global news market, is seen in 90 countries, according to CNN.
