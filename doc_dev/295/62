   Cable News Network is asking the Supreme Court
to let it broadcast tape recordings of deposed Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers from his
Florida jail cell.
   The justices today were awaiting responses from Noriega and the
Bush administration to the emergency CNN request and are unlikely
to act on the matter before next week.
   Meanwhile, the FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes in
Atlanta and was checking whether they were recordings of Noriega.
CNN protested that the tapes were obtained without a warrant and
demanded they be returned.
   The network said the material was taken from a room that been
occupied by one of its reporters at the Omni Hotel, part of a
complex that also houses CNN's offices. A security firm had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, CNN said.
   CNN's lawyers on Thursday asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to
set aside a federal judge's order banning the broadcasts. Kennedy,
who handles such emergency matters from Florida, promptly referred
the case to the full court.
   Lawyers for Noriega and the administration were urged to reply
to the network's arguments by noon Saturday.
   The justices could act on the matter over the weekend but may
decide to take some more time to study it.
   ``CNN has been restrained indefinitely from telecasting news of
great importance to the public,'' lawyers for the network said.
``Balanced against this irreparable harm to the First Amendment,
CNN and the public are speculative threats to interests that can be
otherwise protected.''
   CNN is challenging an order issued by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami on Nov. 8 that bars CNN from broadcasting
at least some portions of the seven tapes until Hoeveler can
determine whether the broadcasts would endanger Noriega's right to
a fair trial.
   CNN refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler but did agree not
to broadcast tapes of Noriega talking to his lawyers until
receiving some word from the Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender shortly after the U.S.
invasion of Panama last December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state that they
are talking to their lawyers.
   In addition to the emergency request, CNN's lawyers filed a
formal appeal with the full Supreme Court that seeks to have the
justices declare Hoeveler's order an unconstitutional prior
restraint on free speech.
   The network's lawyers said Noriega's rights to a fair trial have
been jeopardized by the government's taping of his conversations,
not by any CNN action.
   ``Gagging CNN will neither cure nor avoid any breach by the
prosecution,'' the lawyers said. ``It will serve only to punish a
news medium which has faithfully executed its constitutional role
by reporting on criminal proceedings and allegations of unlawful
government action.''
   A series of Supreme Court decisions has greatly limited judges'
power to issue such ``gag orders'' to safeguard fair trial rights.
   In a 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down an order
issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a Nebraska
murder case.
   In that case, the court said such prior restraints may be used
only as a last resort and that judges always must first consider
less-drastic measures.
