<HEAD>U.S. Journalists Travel to Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. journalists left aboard an Air Force
cargo plane Aug. 12 for Saudi Arabia to join American troops.
   Before leaving the United States, they were briefed by Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. Central Command, at
MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla.
   Journalists had protested to the Pentagon that U.S. troops
arrived in Saudi Arabia without American reporters allowed into the
country to cover their activities. Defense Department officials had
promised to work on the matter.
   Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, then moved toward that country's
border with Saudi Arabia. On Aug. 7, the United States dispatched
troops to Saudi Arabia to defend the oil-rich kingdom against a
possible Iraqi incursion. But no pool of American news reporters
was organized to accompany the American forces to view the
situation first-hand.
   U.S. officials said Saudi officials established the ground rules
that kept U.S. journalists out of the kingdom.
   When U.S. forces invaded Panama last December, a small group of
American journalists accompanied the troops. The reporters were
selected in advance by their employers and pledged to keep their
movement secret to protect the security of the military operation.
   But journalists complained that the Pentagon pool did not work
in Panama, where reporters were kept away from the action.
   The arrangement was set up after the U.S. invasion of Grenada,
when journalists were kept away from the Caribbean nation entirely.
   Journalists from The Associated Press, Reuters, United Press
International, Scripps-Howard News Service, Cable News Network,
National Public Radio, the Milwaukee Journal, the Los Angeles Times
and Time Magazine are in the pool.

<HEAD>Middle East Crisis Boosts Network News Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public interest in the Middle East crisis
boosted the ratings for the three network evening news shows by 15
percent Aug. 6 through Aug. 8, a CBS research executive said.
   The 24-hour Cable News Network also said its coverage has
boosted ratings, with the highest daily average recorded on Aug. 8
_ a 1.5 rating that represents 831,000 homes. It was more than
double CNN's audience this quarter.
   That rating, based on Nielsen audience estimates, was CNN's
highest since its coverage of the U.S. invasion of Panama last
December, said CNN spokesman John Bianchi.
   ``The American public is definitely interested in the (Middle
East) story,'' said David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president for
research, citing preliminary overnight ratings from 24 major cities.
   ``CBS Evening News'' had the biggest increase, up 22 percent in
overnight ratings compared with those for the same three-day period
in the preceding two weeks, he said.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' were up 16
percent and 8 percent, respectively, he said.
   ``It's conceivable that the three network news ratings will
beat'' those of this week's prime-time programs when the week's
national ratings are averaged out, ``and based on these numbers it
should,'' he said.
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather, who cut short a vacation in France
when Iraq invaded Kuwait, has been among CBS overseas staffers
reporting the story, with Rather working from Jordan.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw and his ABC counterpart, Peter Jennings, have
remained in New York to anchor their evening newscasts, but ABC
``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel flew to Cairo to broadcast from
there Aug. 9.
   Garrick Utley, co-anchorman of NBC's ``Sunday Today,'' went to
Cairo to co-anchor the program from there Aug. 12.

<HEAD>Iraq Jamming Voice of America, BBC Broadcasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voice of America and the BBC increased their
Arabic-language broadcasts after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and
Iraq began jamming both services.
   The broadcasts have been heavy on news about the invasion and
international efforts to punish President Saddam Hussein.
   The U.S. service was trying to bypass the interruption by
beaming its programs to Iraq through satellite television
broadcasts. VOA Deputy Director Robert Coonrod said Iraqis can tune
in if they have a satellite dish or access to one through a local
TV station.
   Satellite transmissions, too, can be jammed. But experts say
Iraq would need to jam the entire Indian Ocean satellite in order
to block VOA.
   The English-language programs of the VOA and BBC have not been
blocked, Coonrod said Aug. 7.
   VOA increased the number of hours it broadcasts in Arabic to the
Middle East from 7{ daily to nearly 10, and replaced music programs
with more news.
   The BBC expanded its Arabic-language broadcasts from nine to 10{
hours.
   ``Jamming the BBC is always the last resort of those who wish to
suppress the truth _ and in a way it is a tribute to the role of
the World Service at times of crisis,'' said David Witherow, deputy
managing director of the BBC World Service.
   ``Jamming is never entirely effective and I am sure that
listeners throughout the region are relying on the BBC for news,''
he said.
