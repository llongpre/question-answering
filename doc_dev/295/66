   ATLANTA -- Cable News Network, despite higher audience
ratings, is meeting resistance from some advertisers over its
new, higher advertising rates.
   In late January, flush with success from its highly
praised coverage of the Mideast war, the network, owned by
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., told advertisers it planned
to raise rates. Moreover, CNN took the unusual step of asking
agencies for "givebacks" of commercial time.

   Some advertisers say that CNN's requests for higher ad
rates have been unrealistic and that the network's search for
givebacks -- in which an advertiser returns to the network
commercial time already paid or contracted for -- has fallen
almost totally on deaf ears.
   The extent to which CNN is able to cajole advertisers may
ultimately affect Turner Broadcasting's bottom line. Turner
officials are estimating that CNN will go over budget by $35
million, or about 35%, in the first six months of this year
as a result of the cost of war coverage.
   CNN says most advertisers have reacted favorably to the
network's push for higher rates. "A handful have balked at
the pricing," said Joe Uva, executive vice president, CNN
sales. A 30-second prime-time spot, he said, now goes for
$20,000 and up, compared with about $3,500 in early January.
"But for the most part, the advertisers understand that we're
delivering a higher audience."
   Alison Danzberger, senior vice president and director of
the national broadcast unit at Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, said
CNN initially tried to treble some ad rates. But, "We have
since worked with them to get back to more realistic levels,"
she said, declining to give specific figures.
   Ms. Danzberger also said Foote Cone is considering CNN's
requests for givebacks on a case-by-case basis. But she adds
that she is "very reluctant" to accommodate the network.
   "Often, in cable, you're {faced with} underdeliveries,"
she said. In this case, "we bought the time, and we have
{the} right to enjoy the overdelivery. This is one for us."
   Added John McNamara, senior vice president and media
director at LaMarca Group Inc.: "People in my end of the
business are takers rather than givers. If {CNN}
overdelivers, we're not inclined to pay more for it."
   CNN's Mr. Uva said only that some advertisers have
declined to work with the network on givebacks, while others
are cooperating to some extent. He declined to be more
specific.
   Mr. McNamara and others also questioned whether CNN would
be able to sustain the high audience ratings of the past
month and, thus, whether it would be able to continue to
press for high ad rates. CNN's average daily ratings jumped
more than tenfold in the first week of the war. Since then,
the ratings have fallen back and are running at about three
times prewar levels.
   "Historically, CNN has enjoyed a `bonus' audience" when
major news breaks, Mr. McNamara said. "But over time, they've
gone back to their normal ratings, and that's what's going to
happen here."
   But Lou Schultz, executive vice president and director of
media services for Lintas:USA, with clients that include
General Motors, Kodak and International Business Machines,
says CNN will likely end up with a higher level of ratings --
"especially if a ground war occurs."
   "I think there will be a major shift in viewers'
attitudes," and CNN may be able to raise its rates "closer to
those of the networks," Mr. Schultz said.
