   Some satellite dish owners in Central and South
America no longer will get Cable News Network for free.
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc., CNN's owner, said Thursday it
plans to begin scrambling its CNN feed south of the border.
   The company said it will make the switch next month when it
begins beaming the Turner Network Television movie channel to the
region on a scrambled signal. TBS said the dish owners were
receiving the service illegally for two years.
   TBS feeds its 24-hour news channel into about 35,000 hotel rooms
and 250,000 homes in the region and sells its signal to about 35
broadcast clients, TV stations and networks.
   South American satellite dish owners who want to continue
receiving CNN would have to buy a receiver and decoder from an
equipment company, at a cost of about $1,300, and then enter a
contract with CNN to unscramble the feed.
   Although CNN does not now contract with individuals, spokeswoman
Kitsy Riggall said the company would ``certainly work with anybody
who wants to receive it.''
   TBS, which has been scrambling its signal in the United States
for five years, said it was concerned about ``weak copyright laws
in the region.''
   The company said it has no plans to scramble CNN's signal to the
rest of the world.
