   Robert Wussler, the No. 2 executive of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., resigned to become president and chief executive officer of Communications Satellite Corp.'s Video Enterprises unit. 

   Mr. Wussler's move surprised many analysts and industry executives, who said they wouldn't have expected the veteran television programmer to trade his $400,000 a year Turner post for the helm of the loss-plagued Comsat unit, which beams pay-per-view TV to hotels. 

   Associates of Mr. Wussler said he was restless and often frustrated in the shadow of Chairman Ted Turner, but quit on good terms. 
Mr. Wussler said he left Turner Broadcasting for the opportunity to work for a "technology blessed corporation." 

   Mr. Wussler is also a Turner Broadcasting director, but the company didn't say whether he'll resign that post as well. 

   For Turner Broadcasting, Mr. Wussler's departure will test the depth of the company's executive ranks. 
He was responsible for Turner Broadcasting's extensive ties to the Soviet Union, negotiating the advent of the Goodwill Games in 1986, the use of a Soviet satellite to transmit Cable News Network, and even had a hand in the signing of a Soviet basketball player by the company's Atlanta Hawks team. 
He also represented the company in negotiations with professional sports leagues, including the National Basketball Association, which plays dozens of games on Turner's networks. 

   Yesterday, Mr. Turner acted fast to fill the gap. 
Upon hearing from Mr. Wussler in the morning that he was leaving, Mr. Turner divided the senior executive vice president's duties among the chairman's top three lieutenants, according to company insiders. 

   But the division came out somewhat awkwardly, they said, with responsibility for the company's sports operations going to the top cable-sales executive, Terry McGuirk, and oversight of the Goodwill Games assigned to Paul Beckham, senior vice president of finance and administration. 
Gerry Hogan, president of Turner Entertainment Networks, was given responsibility for advertising, public relations, research and production. 

   "It's a changing of the guard," said Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan Associates Inc. "Wussler was part of the original core team." 

   Mr. Wussler was also the only senior Turner Broadcasting executive with significant industry experience before joining the company. 
Messrs. 
Hogan and McGuirk are both old friends and proteges of Mr. Turner. 

   Separately, Turner Broadcasting said CNN hired Pamela Hill, vice president and executive producer of ABC News, for the posts of vice president and executive producer of CNN's new investigative unit. 
Ms. Hill was in charge of ABC News Closeup, ABC News specials and ABC News cultural programming produced for the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network. 

   "This is a rare opportunity to pursue serious journalism," Ms. Hill said. 

   For Washington-based Comsat, Mr. Wussler's hiring may signal a renewed interest in video programming. 
The company, founded by Congress to represent the U.S. in the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or Intelsat, lost about $80 million earlier this decade on an aborted attempt to start a direct-broadcast satellite network. 
In the past three years, Comsat's Video Enterprises unit has invested $125 million to develop pay-per-view installations in hotel rooms, estimates James McCabe, senior vice president of Nomura Securities. 
The effort has yielded steady losses, expected to be $10 million this year. 

   "They need somebody with some stature in the industry to come in and run that cotton-picking company to see if they can make some money at it," said Mr. McCabe. 

   Richard McGraw, Comsat vice president of corporate affairs, dispelled speculation that Mr. Wussler's arrival means Comsat wants to take another shot at video programming. 
"At this point, there are no plans to do anything other than to grow the existing {hotel} business," he said. 

   But Mr. Wussler -- who, before going to Turner in 1980, rose from the mailroom to become president of CBS Sports in a 21-year career with the network -- acknowledges that he wouldn't have left Turner Broadcasting merely to run a hotel pay-per-view operation. 

   "Comsat is in the satellite business, the research and development business -- they're at the cutting edge of all the things you need going into the 1990s," he said. 
"You blend a sense of programming and marketing with that, and you really have something."
