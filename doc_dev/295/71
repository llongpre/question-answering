   The new chairman of the quasi-governmental Japan
Broadcasting Corp. said he has dropped plans for a world-wide
news network to compete with Cable News Network, a unit of
Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   Mikio Kawaguchi, who became chairman of the Japanese
broadcaster in July, said research showed that the global
network proposed last year by his predecessor would be
unprofitable.

   "I have concluded that we will keep the concept or spirit
of a global news network, but . . . as a business it's not
feasible," Mr. Kawaguchi said.
   Former chairman Keiji Shima proposed a world-wide news
network that, in cooperation with other broadcasters around
the world, would compete with CNN, which he said was forcing
U.S. news on the rest of the world.
   Under Mr. Shima's plan, broadcasters from Asia, Europe and
North America would have been responsible for eight-hour
daily segments focusing on their own regions.
   CNN, the Atlanta-based 24-hour news network, has been
expanding its coverage in Asia to compete with the British
Broadcasting Corp.'s new satellite news network in Asia.
   Mr. Kawaguchi said research showed Mr. Shima's proposal
would cost at least 100 billion yen ($1.29 billion) for
equipment and manpower alone, but wouldn't yield the 150
billion yen in revenue needed to turn a profit.
   He said Japanese Broadcasting Corp. would continue to
expand its own global news coverage.
