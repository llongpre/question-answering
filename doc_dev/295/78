   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. got a jump on
the school year today with the launch of its commercial-free news
show for use in the classroom.
   The producers of the program, CNN Newsroom, which made its debut
today, say they want to give principals and teachers a chance to
review the daily news program and decide if it fits their class
plans.
   There's another reason for getting an early start _ it gives Ted
Turner's Cable News Network a jump on the advertiser-supported
Channel One news service that Whittle Communications plans to offer
starting in March.
   ``School might not start until the first of September, but
teachers are already planning the fall semester,'' said Paul Amos,
an executive vice president at CNN. ``If they like it, they can put
the program on beginning day one of the school year for students.''
   CNN plans to carry the 15-minute shows without commercials at
3:45 a.m. EDT each weekday so that teachers may tape them and
replay all or parts of them in the classroom later in the day.
   The first show featured the day's headlines, including a report
on Rep. Mickey Leland, the Texas Democrat killed in a plane crash
in Ethiopia, and feature stories on a Georgia high school teacher
who publishes a folklore magazine, China's new student
indoctrination program and a weekend rock concert in Moscow.
   Along with the news shows, Turner is making a teacher's guide
available via computer mail to suggest ways the program can be used
to inspire discussions or research.
   The Channel One service, which runs 12 minutes a day with two
minutes of commercials, was tested for seven weeks last spring in
six middle and high schools. While the shows were generally
well-received by teachers and students in the test, several
national educational groups protested vehemently against giving
advertisers a vehicle for pitching products in the classroom.
   Officials in New York and California have banned Channel One
from their schools because of the commercials.
   Turner had planned to include public service-type commercials on
CNN Newsroom but decided to exclude advertising altogether and pick
up the seven-figure tab himself after hearing some eleventh-hour
complaints from educators.
   Channel One is planning to make massive donations to schools of
television monitors, satellite dishes and videocassette recorders
along with programming.
   It hopes to have 1,000 schools hooked up by launch date in March
and 8,000 by the fall of 1990.
   Turner is not donating TV monitors or recorders, but has
encouraged the cable systems that carry the program to provide free
hookups to schools and donations of VCRs or television sets where
needed.
   CNN's Amos said he expects 1,000 schools will make use of the
CNN Newsroom program when schools open this fall.
   Two other cable networks also are planning special programs for
the classroom; neither will carry ads.
   C-Span, the cable network that carries congressional sessions,
plans to run a student-oriented 10-minute program on a single
subject every week starting Aug. 22.
   The Discovery Channel will offer a daily one-hour show for the
classroom starting Sept. 18 with programming in areas such as
science, social studies and world events.
