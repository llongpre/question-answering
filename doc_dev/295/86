   A Soviet satellite will help Ted Turner add to
CNN's worldwide audience.
   Turner's all-news Cable News Network said it has completed a
deal with the Soviet government to use a Statsionar 12 satellite in
the Sputnik system to transmit CNN's TV signal. The signal will
cover an area from South Africa to Norway and from Hong Kong to the
Azores islands off Portugal's coast, said CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth.
   The satellite, positioned over the Indian Ocean, complements
satellites that broadcast the network to South America, Europe and
western Asia.
   CNN said its signal will be available 24 hours a day to 58
million households around the globe.
   Haworth said CNN also is working on a deal with the Soviets to
have its signal broadcast for widespread use in Moscow, where
currently it is ``only watched by the Soviet Television Authority,
(Soviet President) Mikhail Gorbachev and probably someone in the
Kremlin,'' he said.
