   San Francisco's killer earthquake sent a
televised jolt throughout the nation Tuesday as the three major
networks and CNN scrambled to send live and videotape reports from
the scene.
   For network news staffs, it was controlled pandemonium. At times
CNN augmented its own coverage with video feeds from three
stations, all of whom it credited on the air. The stations were
independent KTVU-TV, and two NBC affiliates, KCRA-TV in Sacramento
and KRON-TV in San Francisco.
   Because ABC had planned to air the third game of the World
Series from Candlestick Park, it had the largest staff and
electronic gear at the scene. With all-sports ESPN, which it
co-owns, it aired some of the widest, earliest live and taped video
coverage of the quake's aftermath.
   The ABC Sports blimp provided early live and taped aerial
pictures of a one-block fire in San Francisco, a shattered highway,
and the broken upper section of the Bay Bridge. ABC Sports reporter
Al Michaels, at an ABC control truck at Candlestick Park, helped
describe the scenes.
   At one point, ESPN, which was to cover the World Series game but
wasn't broadcasting it when the tremor struck, showed a live,
quaking picture of the field at Candlestick Park as an aftershock
hit.
   ESPN reporter Bob Ley, describing his initial move to leave the
park after the quake, reported that San Francisco Giants manager
Roger Craig ``was right behind me. It was scary.''
   Although all-news CNN got the first jump on the story for cable
viewers, ABC's Michael's had been on the air when the quake hit,
doing a pre-game report at Candlestick Park.
   The ABC picture turned to static, a still slide for the World
Series appeared, then ABC cut to the series, ``Roseanne.'' Then, at
8:10 p.m. EDT, an off-screen announcer said there had been a
``major quake'' in the San Francisco area.
   CBS anchor Dan Rather, in a ``flash booth'' for bulletins in New
York, began his first report, lasting one minute, at 8:21 p.m.. He
was followed two minutes later by ABC's Washington-based
``Nightline'' anchor, Ted Koppel.
   NBC's man at the quake scene, Bob Jamieson, wound up trapped in
San Francisco traffic after leaving Candlestick Park. He had to
report by cellular telephone from his car.
   Two of the networks, CBS and ABC, signed off coverage after
12:30 a.m. EDT, with CBS the first to go, returning to ``The Pat
Sajak Show.'' ABC's Koppel signed off at 12:40 a.m. EDT.
   However, Rather returned with a startling update shortly after
that, reporting that as many as 200 persons were killed in the
quake.
   Although NBC's continuous coverage went past 1 a.m. EDT
Wednesday, it was was the slowest off the mark earlier. A staff
member said its coverage started at 8:40 p.m. EDT Tuesday with a
bulletin by Burbank-based correspondent Keith Morrison.
   Eight minutes later, Mary Alice Williams anchored for NBC from
New York, but without the pictures that ABC and CNN already were
airing. She said that NBC's TV signal from San Francisco had been
temporarily knocked out by the quake.
   Shortly after 9 p.m., anchor Tom Brokaw succeeded her, with NBC
airing its first live shots from San Francisco.
   All three networks relied on live and taped video pictures and
interviews from their San Francisco affiliates, KGO-TV for ABC,
KPIX-TV for CBS and KRON-TV for NBC, with ABC having more of its
own coverage on the air.
   During its coverage, ABC illustrated with tape footage what it
said was the gallows humor of some fans at Candlestick Park. It
showed several persons holding a paper banner that said: ``The
Sleeping Giants Have Awakened.''
   Several times during the night, NBC and CNN simultaneously aired
the same videotape footage that KRON, NBC's affiliate, had made of
the fire and quake damage from a helicopter and on the ground. CNN
gave an on-air visual credit to the station each time.
   Rather said in an interview late Tuesday that he was at the CBS
Broadcast Center here when first word of the quake came in.
   ``Our initial thought was,`How big is it?' '' he said. ``Then it
was, `Let's go, let's go on the air at least with a bulletin.' I
remember thinking, `I hope it's not the big one.' ''
