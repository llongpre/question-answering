<LEADPARA>  THE WORLD of cable television was relatively dormant until Ted Turner changed
the industry 15 years ago this month with big ideas and a lot of baseball
games, sitcoms and classic movies.;   At 1 p.m. on Dec. 17, 1976, the obscure
1948 film "Deep Waters" was beamed by satellite to cable systems in four
states from Channel 17, Turner's independent TV station in Atlanta.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That was the beginning of what would come to be known as the TBS
Superstation.;   Cable TV hasn't been the same since.;   Turner's entry into
cable was one of the industry's watershed events as it grew into the
multibillion-dollar business it is today, said Barry L. Sherman, chairman of
the telecommunications department at the University of Georgia.;   "What the
cable business was lacking in the mid-'70s was programming to drive the
machine," Sherman said. "Cable had been around since the 1950s, retransmitting
broadcast signals, but it needed its own impetus, and Ted Turner provided
that.";   Now cable can be found in 60 percent of the U.S. households with TV
sets, up from 15.1 percent in the month before TBS was launched, according to
the National Cable Television Association.;   TBS is the fourth most widely
carried cable network. It's available to 58 million U.S. households,
representing 98 percent of cable homes and 60 percent of television homes,
according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by
Turner Broadcasting System Inc.;   Only ESPN, with 59 million households, CNN,
which has 59 million households and is also owned by Turner Broadcasting, and
USA, with 58 million households, have greater potential viewership, according
to the cable TV association.;   TBS, called WTCG until 1979, went on the air
with a wide, familiar mix of 24-hour programming. Over the years the lineup
has included movies, reruns of "Leave It To Beaver" and Atlanta Braves
baseball games.;   That variety gave people more reason to turn on cable TV.
It also encouraged the start-up of several other nationwide channels, notably
ESPN, Nickelodeon and C-Span, which were on the air within three years.;   The
Superstation's success also gave Turner Broadcasting the foundation to launch
Cable News Network, Headline News, Turner Network Television and the regional
SportSouth.;   "It's one of the greatest stations ever put on cable," said
Harold Freeman, owner of Troy Cable Inc. of Troy, Ala., one of the original
systems to carry TBS.;   "If he hadn't started the ball rolling, put it this
way: I had a 12-channel system, and we had trouble getting enough channels to
fill it up," Freeman said. "Now we've got 58 channels running.";   Today the
TBS schedule remains anchored by such standby reruns as the "Beverly
Hillbillies" and "The Andy Griffith Show," though Turner's acquisition of the
MGM and Warner Bros. film library has vastly expanded the roster of movie
titles.;   The Atlanta Braves, which Turner bought in 1976, also call TBS
their television home, as do the stars of World Championship Wrestling.;   But
the station also recognizes that viewers can watch "Gilligan's Island" only so
many times. So TBS recently began packaging its programming, Segal said.;  
For instance, the station tried to capitalize on the theatrical release of the
"Addams Family" movie last month by bunching several episodes of the old TV
series into a festival. This month, TBS has gathered holiday episodes of
various sitcoms into a Christmas rerun festival.;   TBS has maintained its
standing among the top four cable stations by carrying a broad variety of
shows, said Sherman.;   Advertising, the station's chief form of revenue,
brought in $276.3 million in 1990, up 2 percent from $271.1 million in 1989.; 
 "It's still the jewel in the crown from the advertisers' standpoint because
the demographics are so broad," Sherman said.; Top networks; Here are the top
10 cable television networks, as ranked by the National Cable Television
Association. The name of the network is followed by the number of
subscribers.; 1. ESPN, 59.1 million.; 2. CNN, 58.9 million.; 3. USA, 58.0
million.; 4. TBS, 57.7 million.; 5. The Discovery Channel, 56.0 million.; 6.
Nickelodeon, 55.5 million.; 7. C-SPAN, 55.0 million.; 8. TNT, 54.9 million.;
8. MTV, 54.9 million.; 9. The Nashville Network, 53.9 million.; 10. The Family
Channel, 53.7 million.; Associated Press  </TEXT>
