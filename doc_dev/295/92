<HEAD>Tribune To End `USA Tonight' Under Deal With Turner Broadcasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tribune Broadcasting Co. will discontinue its
``USA Tonight'' national newscast and use Cable News Network to
expand local newscasts in six markets under an agreement announced
April 9 with Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   The 10-year deal, announced by TBS Chairman Ted Turner and
Tribune President James C. Dowdle, also includes joint production
of news, documentary specials and entertainment programs.
   As part of the agreement, Tribune will end ``USA Tonight'' and
its IDNX news service. Six Tribune stations will become affiliates
of Cable News Network, subscribing to CNN coverage on a
non-exclusive basis.
   Those stations are WPIX in New York, KTLA in Los Angeles, WGN in
Chicago, WGNX in Atlanta, KWGN in Denver and WGNO in New Orleans.
   The stations will use the CNN coverage to expand their evening
newscasts to one hour this summer, Tribune officials said in a
statement. ``USA Tonight'' and IDNX will be discontinued in June,
Dowdle said.

<HEAD>Ban Against Siskel and Ebert Lifted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twentieth Century Fox lifted its ban April 9
against critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, who gave harsh reviews
of a recent Fox film.
   The studio said three weeks earlier that they would be barred
indefinitely from preview screenings after both critics said on a
television talk show that the comedy ``Nuns on the Run'' wasn't
funny.
   Siskel called Fox April 9 shortly before the screening of
another Fox film _ the first in Chicago since ``Nuns on the Run'' _
and asked if he was still unwelcome.
   The ban was over, a company spokesman said, and Siskel went to
the show. Ebert didn't know about the lifting of the ban and was
out of town.
   ``I'm happy the ban is lifted,'' Ebert said. ``I feel
vindicated. In the future I will continue to review Fox films in
the same evenhanded way I have in the past.''
   The two appear on ``At the Movies,'' a syndicated half-hour
television show.

<HEAD>Man Who Threatened TV Anchor Gets Three-Year Prison Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of threatening to kill
television anchorwoman Kelly Lange was sentenced April 9 to the
maximum of three years in prison.
   Warren Sevy Hudson, a 57-year-old unemployed laborer described
as an obsessive fan of Ms. Lange's, was convicted Dec. 5 on one
count of making a terrorist threat.
   Hudson, who had sent the KNBC-TV anchorwoman flowers, jewelry
and a fur coat since 1985, threatened in a postcard to Ms. Lange to
shoot her, prosecutors said.
   Ms. Lange testified in Hudson's trial the postcard read
``something to the effect that, `I'm going to blow your head off in
the parking lot some night and you're never going to know what hit
you.'''
   When Hudson was arrested at the Linda Motel in August 1989,
police recovered a .38-caliber handgun and ammunition.
   Superior Court Judge J.D. Smith gave Hudson the maximum sentence
under the law, but Hudson will serve less than two years because he
has already been in jail for the equivalent of one year since his
arrest.

   NBC's Maria Shriver, citing her new baby and a
weekly commute from Los Angeles, announced April 8 she no longer
will anchor Saturday's ``NBC Nightly News'' and co-anchor ``Sunday
Today.''
   Shriver, who gave birth to a daughter in December, said she will
stay with NBC News.

in Washington with Garrick Utley, and occasional specials.
