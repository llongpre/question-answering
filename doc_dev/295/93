   Mr. Beckham, 47 years old, succeeds William H. Grumbles
Jr., 41, who was named to the new position of president,
Turner Program Services International. A former Home Box
Office executive who joined Turner in 1989, Mr. Grumbles will
now market Turner's networks overseasan area the company sees
as a bonanza for potential growth.
   "We are putting some emphasis on the international area,
and we're hoping that Bill (Grumbles) can get us better
prepared for that," said Terence F. McGuirk, Turner's
executive vice president.
   Mr. Beckham's former duties will effectively be split
between two other executives. Randy L. Booth, vice president,
finance, will now also oversee Turner's accounting, business
affairs and information service departments. Mr. Booth, 38,
will report to Ted Turner, the company's chairman and
president. And William M. Shaw, formerly Turner's vice
president, human resources, has been named to the new post of
vice president, administration. He is 46.
   In the fall, Mr. Turner named Mr. McGuirk, a Turner
veteran, as executive vice president, making him the
company's No. 2 executive. The appointment followed the
departure of Gerald Hogan, who resigned to become vice
chairman of Whittle Communications L.P. in Knoxville, Tenn.
   Separately, Cable News Network said it will transmit its
CNN International program to Asia and Latin America beginning
Jan. 28. CNN already distributes its domestic programming in
Asia and Latin America, and transmits the international news
program in Europe.
