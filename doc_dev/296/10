<LEADPARA>  The three CNN correspondents who transmitted live from their Baghdad hotel
room during the U.S. bombing were forced by Iraqi officials to sign off this
morning, ending an exclusive 18-hour account of the dramatic attack.;    "We
can no longer transmit live to our audience. This is Peter Arnett signing off
with CNN," correspondent Arnett said at 7:59 a.m. PST today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Arnett said an Iraqi official came to their room in the Al-Rashid Hotel
shortly before 7 p.m. Baghdad time and was "making a gesture which requires us
to cut off our communications. The reason for this order was military
censorship.";    CNN officials in Atlanta said they had no idea when they
would be able to get the correspondents back on the air.;    CNN correspondent
John Holliman suggested that the Iraqi order might be connected to comments by
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in Washington that the coalition forces
were getting some reports on the success of their air attack via CNN.;   
Thanks to CNN, America and the world heard the sounds of war in Iraq as they
happened in the middle of a Baghdad night lighted by missile fire and bomb
explosions.;    While ABC and NBC lost their communications connections to the
same hotel -- and CBS never could establish its line -- the three from CNN
told us all what they saw.;    "We're going to go back to Baghdad," anchor
David French said, "because we can.";    Unlike the attack, CNN's live
coverage of the bombing wasn't planned. In fact, anchor Bernard Shaw was
supposed to be on a plane out of Baghdad at dawn. Instead, he was on hand to
describe the beginning of the war.;    'Giant sparklers';  "We see what
appears to be giant sparklers," he said. "Exploding balls, up in the air, one
after another.";    It was radio on television, but by any measure, it was
more remarkable than any pictures we saw Wednesday. So remarkable, in fact,
that one local station dumped its own network to carry these three men in a
hotel room.;    Shaw likened it to a Fourth of July at the Washington
Monument. Colleague Holliman said it was like a million fireflies or a launch
at Cape Canaveral. Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting from
Vietnam, said it was like nothing he ever saw there.;    "Hello, Atlanta,"
Holliman began before it was even known if the flashes the three saw were an
attack or reaction to a false alarm by Iraqi gunners. "I don't know if you can
hear me now or not, but I'm going to begin to talk to you as long as I can."; 
  It was shades of Edward R. Murrow's famous, "This . . . is London" broadcast
of the blitz.;    Global audience;    Only this time, the audience was global,
a village united by a phone line and satellite technology.;    That fortuitous
line (the only one that ran through the Iraqi telecommunications center), a
little fast talking and no doubt a lot of luck put the CNN crew in the right
place at the right time -- the ninth floor of the hotel in downtown Baghdad --
to witness the start of the war against Iraq.;    Holliman put his mike up to
the window so we could hear the sound of bombing.;    "I'm going to be very
quiet and let you listen," he said. "We can hear jet planes flying overhead
now, and there are some bright flashes on the horizon. This is the closest and
most intense activity so far. Whoa! This looks like a million fireflies.";   
The reporters were using satellite transmitters powered by portable generators
to beam their reports to the United States from their positions in the
Al-Rashid Hotel. They said Baghdad's electricity and phone systems had been
out since the air attacks began.;    Late Wednesday night, it appeared the
network might lose its connection.;    "We gotta go," said Shaw. "Someone is
knocking on our door. John and I are going to hide. We're signing off for a
minute.";    It was an Iraqi security guard. Shaw hid in the closet. Holliman
went under the bed. Arnett met the guard.;    Shaw told viewers later that
Arnett said, "I spent 10 years in Vietnam. The bombs outside don't bother me.
But if I go into the bomb shelter downstairs (where the other 40 or so
American reporters had been herded), I go crazy.";    Amazingly, the guard
bought his story and left, confiscating only videotape shot out the window.;  
 And thus continued coverage by Ted Turner's cable upstart that was so
dominant, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said during a Washington news
conference he was watching CNN to find out what was going on in the city under
attack by the U.S. Air Force.;    CNN got another kind of compliment when NBC
anchor Tom Brokaw wound up interviewing Shaw for the latest information in
Baghdad.;    Al Goldstein, news director of San Francisco NBC affiliate KRON
(Ch. 4), dumped huge chunks of his own network's coverage for CNN, explaining,
"We are monitoring both networks. . . . Journalistically, that (CNN's reports
from Baghdad) was the better story.";    The dogged coverage CNN provided took
its toll, though. By late morning in Iraq, Shaw -- who said he had been up for
two days -- began rambling. Shortly afterward, the network gave the
round-the-clock correspondents a respite by televising pre-recorded taped
interviews with soldiers.;    Less than three hours before the war began,
Walter Cronkite, the man whose reports from Vietnam were credited by Lyndon
Johnson with turning middle America against that war, talked to Shaw and
Arnett by phone from New York on CNN.;    He closed the conversation by
beseeching Arnett to take care of himself.;    'Save your skin';  "Peter," he
said, "you're a very valuable asset. . . . You've proved that. Don't
grandstand. Save your skin, boy.";    "Thank you for that advice, Walter,"
Arnett replied. "I've got nothing left personally to prove. It's just the
greatest story in the world at this moment in time and I'd like to cover it as
much as I can."  </TEXT>
