   American television coverage of events in
Beijing was disrupted Friday night when Chinese authorities
``pulled the plug'' on live transmissions from Tiananmen Square.
   ``Goodbye from Beijing,'' CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw said as
Cable News Network signed off its broadcasts from the Chinese
capital. It was shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday in Beijing, or 10
p.m. Friday EDT.
   CBS also had its transmissions cut off from the square. NBC was
cut off by virtue of its sharing satellite transmission equipment
with CNN; and ABC said the government had shut down all satellite
feeds from China.
   Later reports via telephone by CNN Anchor Bernard Shaw said
Chinese officials had issued a news blackout that prohibited crews
from videotaping any events in the country related to the
continuing student protests.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong said foreign reporters were forbidden
to ``incite or instigate Chinese to to march'' and could not
conduct interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at
government offices, schools, factories and mines.
   ``Any violators will be stopped according to the law,'' the
order said.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said in a telephone interview that
the network was continuing to cover the story of students resuming
a week-old hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in Beijing by live
telephone interviews.
   ``We don't know yet what this order means,'' he said. ``Our
crews cannot move around or even shoot tape, but it's too early to
tell what the impact is.''
   Shaw and Haworth said the crews have not been ordered out of the
country.
   Haworth said that the journalists have 30-day visas and that
crews arrived May 12-14 so ``they're there for a while.''
   Earlier, in a live transmission from the Great Wall Sheraton
Hotel in Beijing, CNN showed a government official writing the
official order _ on a note pad provided by CNN editors _ to shut
down the broadcasts.
   The order came about an hour after martial law was declared in
parts of Beijing, including Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of
thousands of Chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms.
   CNN requested the order in writing because it had legal
agreements with the Chinese government to broadcast from Beijing,
editors said in the live transmission.
   The government official said the agreement had been designed for
coverage of the visit to China of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, which ended Friday.
   CBS News broke into the network's season finale broadcast of
``Dallas'' to show anchorman Dan Rather at the network's control
center in Beijing's Hotel Shangri-La as Chinese officials ordered
the network to end its broadcasts.
   Rather reported that Chinese officials ``pulled the plug'' on
live transmissions from Tiananmen Square just after several
helicopters flew over the square. Tape showed Rather preparing to
broadcast from the square, then a screen full of interference.
   He said that when he returned to the control center he was met
by representatives of the government television system saying
they'd been told by the Foreign Ministry to end CBS's broadcasts.
   The written order to CNN said it must shut down the moveable
earth station transmitting its signal to a satellite. Transmission
ceased about four minutes later, after network executives in CNN's
Atlanta headquarters told the staff to obey the letter.
   ``In my 20 years of news reporting I've never seen anything like
this,'' Shaw said before signing off.
   Donna Dees, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said representatives of
the government-run television company were preparing an official
order, similar to CNN's, to put the network off the air.
   After being cut off from Tiananmen Square, CBS was able to
continue with reports from its headquarters at a nearby hotel, but
even that appeared threatened by the impending order, she said.
   ABC had ordered two feeds from China on Friday night using
Chinese television equipment, said spokesman Scott Richardson, but
were apparently caught by the official blackout.
   Bill Baxter, manager of the network desk for NBC News, said the
network shared a satellite with CNN and was unable to get a signal
out of China. He said efforts to book other satellite time were
also stymied by the official blackout.
   Efforts by the Chinese to end live transmissions began at about
8 p.m. EDT, Haworth said. CNN's live China coverage went briefly
off the air at 9:21 p.m. EDT but resumed live coverage several
minutes later.
   Officials then issued a statement that ``we would be live until
they physically unplugged us or issued a written declaration of why
we were to leave, which they did shortly thereafter,'' according to
Haworth.
   Haworth said the shutdown apparently was not due to any specific
coverage by CNN but because the Chinese are ``anxious about
resolving problems in Tiananmen but not on live television.''
