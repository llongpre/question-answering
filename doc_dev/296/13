   A former Texas judge with no news background and
veteran newsman Bernard Shaw will co-anchor Cable News Network's
``The World Today'' when the weeknight news show premieres Monday.
   Catherine Crier, 34, was elected in 1985 as a state district
court judge assigned to Dallas. She resigned last month and became
a CNN staf member Oct. 1.
   The new anchor team was announced Tuesday by CNN, whose new
one-hour program will start at 6 p.m. EDT. The second half hour
will directly compete with the nightly newscasts of CBS, NBC and
ABC, but only in Eastern and Central time zones.
   Those networks, which at 6:30 p.m. EDT give their affiliates the
first of two ``feeds'' of their nightly 30-minute newscasts,
tape-delay those programs for broadcast three hours later on the
West Coast, sometimes updating them with live reports.
   In contrast, CNN's ``The World Today'' will air live nationally.
Crier will co-anchor the program from CNN headquarters in Atlanta,
with Shaw, who has 25 years in news, in Washington, D.C.
