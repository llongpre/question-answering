<LEADPARA>  "We're going to go back to Baghdad," anchor David French said, "because we
can.";    And because he and CNN could, America and the world heard the sounds
of war in Iraq as they happened in the middle of a Baghdad night lighted by
missile fire and bombs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Unlike the attack, it wasn't planned. In fact, anchor Bernard Shaw was
supposed to be on a plane out of Baghdad at dawn. Instead, he was on hand to
describe the beginning of the war.;    'Giant sparklers';  "We see what
appears to be giant sparklers," he said. "Exploding balls, up in the air, one
after another.";    It was radio on television, but by any measure, it was
more remarkable than any pictures we saw Wednesday. So remarkable, in fact,
that one local station dumped its own network to carry these three men in a
hotel room.;    Shaw likened it to the Fourth of July at the Washington
Monument. Colleague John Holliman said it was like a million fireflies or a
launch at Cape Canaveral. Peter Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting
from Vietnam, said it was like nothing he ever saw there.;    "Hello,
Atlanta," Holliman began before it was even known if the flashes the three saw
were an attack or reaction to a false alarm by Iraqi gunners. "I don't know if
you can hear me now or not, but I'm going to begin to talk to you as long as I
can.";    It was shades of Edward R. Murrow's famous, "This . . . is London"
broadcast of the blitz.;    Global audience;  Only this time, the audience was
global, a village united by a phone line and satellite technology.;    That
fortuitous line (the only one that ran through the Iraqi telecommunications
center), a little fast talking and no doubt a lot of luck put the CNN crew in
the right place at the right time -- the ninth floor of the Al-Rashid Hotel in
downtown Baghdad -- to witness the start of the war against Iraq.;    While
ABC and NBC lost their connections to the same hotel -- and CBS never could
establish its line -- the three from CNN told us all what they saw.;    "To
describe for you, ladies and gentlemen, what that looked like against the
canopy of a black sky," Shaw said after one wave of bombing, "it was like the
fireworks finale on the Fourth of July at the base of the Washington
Monument.";    While on CBS, Dan Rather was asking a correspondent in Saudi
Arabia to hold her microphone up so we could hear the sound of an air-raid
siren, Holliman was putting his mike up to the window so we could hear the
sound of bombing.;    "I'm going to be very quiet and let you listen," he
said. "We can hear jet planes flying overhead now, and there are some bright
flashes on the horizon. This is the closest and most intense activity so far.
Whoa! This looks like a million fireflies.";    A million fireflies with the
force of a rocket blast at Cape Canaveral, he decided later as the force shook
the room.;    Then came a sound we didn't hear, but the reporters in the
Baghdad hotel room did.;    'We gotta go';  "We gotta go," said Shaw. "Someone
is knocking on our door. John and I are going to hide. We're signing off for a
minute.";    In Washington, French deadpanned, "We assume that's not the
Fuller Brush man.";    Indeed, it wasn't. It was an Iraqi security guard. Shaw
hid in the closet. Holliman went under the bed. Arnett met the guard.;    Shaw
told viewers later that Arnett said, "I spent 10 years in Vietnam. The bombs
outside don't bother me. But if I go into the bomb shelter downstairs (where
the other 40 or so American reporters had been herded), I go crazy.";   
Amazingly, the guard bought his story and left, confiscating only videotape
shot out the window.;    And thus continued coverage by Ted Turner's cable
upstart that was so dominant, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a Washington
news conference at midevening he was watching CNN to find out what was going
on in the city the U.S. Air Force was attacking.;    CNN got another kind of
compliment when NBC anchor Tom Brokaw wound up interviewing Shaw for the
latest information in Baghdad -- an unprecedented concession in a business
where crediting the other guy, let alone putting him on your air, is just not
done.;    Al Goldstein, news director of San Francisco NBC affiliate KRON (Ch.
4) dumped huge chunks of his own network's coverage for CNN, explaining, "We
are monitoring both networks . . . journalistically, that (CNN's reports from
Baghdad) was the better story.";    San Jose's KICU (Ch. 36) switched over to
CNN entirely and Oakland's KTVU (Ch. 2) did the same for hours at a time.;   
Television and network affiliation will never be the same.;    The dogged
coverage CNN provided took its toll, though. By late morning in Iraq, Shaw --
who said he had been up for two days -- began rambling, repeating himself and
forgetting questions he said he intended to ask. Shortly afterward, the
network gave the round-the-clock correspondents a respite by televising
pre-recorded taped interviews with soldiers.;    Less than three hours before
the war began, Walter Cronkite, the man whose reports from Vietnam were
credited by Lyndon Johnson with turning middle America against that war,
talked to Shaw and Arnett by phone from New York on CNN.;    He closed the
conversation by beseeching Arnett to take care of himself.;    'Save your
skin.';  "Peter," he said, "you're a very valuable asset . . . you've proved
that. Don't grandstand. Save your skin, boy.";    "Thank you for that advice,
Walter," Arnett replied. "I've got nothing left personally to prove. It's just
the greatest story in the world at this moment in time and I'd like to cover
it as much as I can.";    When rockets came and the bombs fell, he did just
that.  </TEXT>
