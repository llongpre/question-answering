   Televison networks all sent dozens of
staffers to cover the Northern California earthquake, but sheer
numbers couldn't always overcome the enormous difficulties the
story presented.
   Even with million-dollar anchors and squadrons of
correspondents, technicians and producers, the three broadcast
networks and CNN quickly learned it's a grind to deliver
compelling, competitive reports in conditions where rumor and
misinformation have flowed like water.
   ABC anchor Peter Jennings arrived at destroyed Interstate 880 on
Wednesday morning and, minutes later, delivered a live dispatch
that demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly
and accurately.
   Jennings said rescue workers had labored through the night to
save lives on the collapsed freeway. Anyone who had spent the
early-morning hours there would have said very little happened
after midnight.
   In one of his initial news bulletins Tuesday night from New
York, CBS' Dan Rather played it safe. Not wanting to speculate on
information he didn't have, Rather read major earthquake figures
from an almanac.
   John Carman, the television critic for the San Francisco
Chronicle, said quake coverage by CNN was sometimes as inexact as
it was instant (CNN was on the air six minutes after the quake hit).
   Carman noted that CNN anchors Molly McCoy and Bob Cain were
unfamiliar with such things as local geography and area codes.
   CBS News has heard some complaints, too. ``We've been criticized
from both ends _ for being too cautious and then I had a call that
we're doing too much coverage,'' said spokeswoman Donna Dees.
   After overcoming various initial jitters, all four networks were
praised by TV critics for steady, informative broadcasts. Ratings
were strong, too.
   The three broadcast network newscasts originated Wednesday night
from the earthquake zone, as Jennings was joined in town by Rather
and NBC's Tom Brokaw. CNN sent Atlanta anchor Lou Waters and 25
correspondents. The networks also broadcast prime-time specials on
the disaster.
   In addition, NBC's ``Today'' show was anchored in San Francisco
and CBS' ``48 Hours'' and ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' planned
broadcasts on the quake for Thursday night. NBC News President
Michael Gartner said his network had 60 staffers in the city.
   Andrew Heyward, the executive producer of ``48 Hours,'' said
Thursday the arrival of the network stars testified to the story's
importance. ``There is an advantage for the anchor to be in the
city _ it's certainly better than in the studio,'' Heyward said.
   Indeed, national interest in the TV accounts and mesmerizing
footage has been profound. Preliminary ratings for the ABC, CBS and
NBC specials Wednesday night indicated nearly half of all homes
with television tuned in.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates, ABC's special, ``The
Great Quake of '89,'' was the highest-rated of the broadcasts,
averaging a 13.2 rating.
   NBC's special, ``Earthquake Aftershock,'' directly competing
with ABC's program at 10 p.m. EDT, was second with a 12.2 rating. A
``CBS Reports'' special, ``The Califoria Earthquake,'' which aired
an hour earlier, averaged an 11.9 rating.
   Each rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   CNN set an all-time viewership record Tuesday night, when more
than 3.6 million homes watched the news network, CNN spokesman
Anthony Masterson said.
   ``The great difficulties are imposed by the loss of power,
traffic jams and obstacles created by the story itself,'' said CNN
Executive Vice President Ed Turner. ``Once you have that
established, the unfolding of the story is not that difficult.''
   Journalistic standards can crumble when dealing with a disaster
such as the San Francisco earthquake, Turner said. ``The greatest
trap is to pass on bad information _ and there's a lot of it out
there _ or create an alarmist atmosphere and scare people. You have
to be judicious in your demeanor.''
   While many are transfixed by the television images, not all are
pleased. Viewers of CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis flooded the
switchboard when Tuesday earthquake coverage first interrupted a TV
movie on acquaintance rape.
