<LEADPARA>  BERNARD Shaw, the CNN news anchor who may be the No. 1 TV news "star" of the
week-old gulf war, hates all the media attention he's getting and thinks it's
"a curse.";    Ironically, Shaw said so Wednesday during a two-hour telephone
press conference with dozens of reporters, arranged by CNN to take advantage
of all the media attention.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even though he'd rather go hide somewhere, Shaw reluctantly concedes it's
"part of the job"; so he's striking while the iron is hot. He's doing the
publicity until it hurts. And when he's done, said Shaw, he'll look over all
the book deals, job offers and other proposals and decide which ones to take,
hopefully without screwing up his life.;    "I refuse to allow this boomlet of
publicity and attention to overwhelm me, my family or my job," he said. "I am
going to remain a normal human being.";    Like it or not, though, Shaw
probably isn't going to be a normal human being from now on. Overnight, he
moved up to superstar status in the news business in the minds of millions of
viewers who remained glued to their sets last week to hear his reports from
Baghdad, where he was trapped in Room 906 of the Al-Rashid Hotel with fellow
CNN reporters John Holliman and Peter Arnett during the first Allied air raids
on the Iraqi capital.;    Shaw's experience isn't unique. Major news events
that seize the nation's full attention can make stars of the TV reporters who
cover them exceptionally well. It happened, for instance, to Shaw's CBS
counterpart, Dan Rather, who became a news star after being stranded on
Galveston Island during Hurricane Carla and sending out exclusive reports for
three hectic days.;    For that matter, Shaw's idol, the late Edward R.
Murrow, became the reigning presence at CBS News after filing memorable radio
reports from the London blitzes of World War II.;    So far, the Gulf War has
provided great opportunities for promising network news personalities to take
a big step up -- NBC's Faith Daniels and Katherine Couric have been
particularly impressive in their war assignments -- and has pushed many lesser
known correspondents to the forefront, among them CBS's Scott Pelley and Allen
Pizzey, NBC's Arthur Kent and CNN's Charles Jaco.;    But the most intense
attention has fallen on the three CNN correspondents who became the only U.S.
voices from Baghdad during the first three days of the war: Arnett, Holliman
and Shaw.;    Back in Baghdad;    Arnett, a veteran war correspondent who won
a Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam coverage, remains in Baghdad, reporting under
heavy Iraqi censorship. (He came under White House fire Wednesday for echoing
the Iraqi government line in a report about an air strike.);    Holliman, who
returned with Shaw over the weekend and took part in Wednesday's press
conference, is grateful for the positive publicity, but has no illusions about
becoming a big-money news star and intends to remain at CNN.;    "I've had a
couple of offers," he said. "But I don't think I'm going to be changed by
this. My wife says I'm still the same goofy, fat, balding guy I was when I
left.";    But, of them all, Shaw is in the best position to take advantage of
his sudden celebrity. At 49, he's a 27-year news veteran and holds the top
on-air job at CNN already. At the very least, he's now likely to gain the
parity with the broadcast anchors -- ABC's Peter Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw
and CBS' Rather -- that he's been denied because he's on a young, upstart
network.;    Shaw insists he's doing nothing to use his gulf war acclaim as
any kind of bargaining chip. However, he did use the press conference as an
opportunity to remind CNN its journalists are severely underpaid when compared
to their counterparts at ABC, CBS and NBC.;    "I'm very concerned," he said.
"We've lost some outstanding people. The only way to keep good people is to
pay them," he said.;    Though Shaw said he has received offers from other
networks in the wake of his Baghdad experience, he expressed his loyalty to
CNN. (Even if he wanted to leave, CNN has him under contract until February
1993.);    All through the gulf war coverage, CNN's ratings have surged. The
reporting by Shaw and his colleagues from Baghdad is widely seen as a
principal reason for the surge in CNN viewing.;    But CNN has adopted a
strict "no stars" policy since it was started by Ted Turner a decade ago. That
policy has kept the network from having to pay the huge salaries Brokaw,
Rather, Jennings and many other broadcast news stars receive.;    Many now
believe the emergence of Shaw as a major news celebrity will force CNN to
renegotiate his contract and maybe even start paying bigger money to its other
rising gulf war stars.;    Asked if this means the end of the "no stars"
policy at the network, Shaw said it probably doesn't.;    "It's quite possible
to have a handsome salary and not have a star on your door," he said.;   
Caught in air raids;    One reason Shaw has been somewhat embarrassed by all
the publicity surrounding his Baghdad stint is the rather accidental nature of
it. He flew to Baghdad during the week before the war to try for an interview
with Saddam Hussein.;    Unable to get the interview, Shaw was ready to leave
Baghdad the morning after the air raids began. His flight canceled, he
realized he had no choice but to stay at the Al-Rashid Hotel until some other
way out could be arranged.;    In the meantime, Shaw and the others discovered
they were the only reporters still in Baghdad with communications to the
outside world. They began using their "four-wire" phone, which bypassed the
inoperative hotel switchboard and bombed-out Baghdad telephone system, to
relay reports home by satellite.;    "I was just doing my job, like any other
reporter," he said.;    But those who listened to Shaw's reports noticed
something extra that lifted them above the ordinary. He had become much more
personal, even revealing what many felt was severe signs of stress.;    "I was
very much aware of the stress," Shaw recalled. "I began thinking of the people
and places that I loved back home.";    The result was heavily emotional,
deeply affecting reports that persuaded even those familiar with Shaw's work
that he was a changed man, letting much more of himself show through. The
comparisons with his idol, Murrow, began.;    "When I was 13 years old, I
decided I wanted to be just like him," Shaw said, though clearly uncomfortable
with the comparison. "I know it's a compliment, but that comparison gives me
pause.";    Shaw now acknowledges he was under severe stress all during the
stay in Baghdad. He went more than 40 hours without sleep, followed by a
hectic, frightening 15-hour drive to the Jordanian border with an Iraqi driver
after Iraq ordered CNN shut down and the correspondents to leave. (The
decision to let Arnett stay on came later.);    After their arrival back at
CNN headquarters in Atlanta, the network inveigled Shaw and Holliman into
going right on its "Larry King Live" talk show to tell of their ordeal. Shaw
appeared tired, strained and severely shaken on that show.;    Now that he has
returned to near-universal acclaim, Shaw has begun to put the whole experience
in perspective. He's not anxious to return to the war front and, in fact, has
just about made up his mind to refuse if asked to go back by CNN.;    "We were
pretty much pushing the margin," said Shaw. "I've decided I'll never again put
myself or my family in that situation again. I've never, in 27 years, refused
an assignment, but I will from now on."  </TEXT>
