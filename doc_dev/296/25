   The week before Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in
the United States for the December arms summit, President Reagan
granted a rare interview to the four major networks' anchors.
   That's right, four: Peter Jennings of ABC, Dan Rather of CBS,
Tom Brokaw of NBC, and Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor for CNN.
   Although he had already interviewed Reagan in October, Shaw
agreed that the prime-time news special in which he questioned
Reagan along with the three other anchors was a high-profile symbol
of CNN's hard-earned respectability.
   ``That conversation the week before the summit was a turning
point, I suppose you would have to say,'' said Shaw in an interview
at his anchor desk at the CNN bureau. ``I went back and asked
(White House Chief of Staff) Howard Baker about that, and he said,
`We regard you as the fourth network, and that's why we included
you in the interview.'''
   The Reagan interview turned a lot of unsought attention on the
low-key Shaw, a former correspondent for ABC, CBS and Westinghouse
Broadcasting, who recalls idolizing Edward R. Murrow as a child in
Chicago and at 13 declaring, ``I want to be a CBS News
correspondent.''
   After stints with Westinghouse and CBS, then covering Latin
America for ABC, Shaw joined CNN in 1980. He wanted to be an
anchor, and ``there was no room at the inn at ABC, a lot of other
talented people standing in line.'' Plus, he was encouraged to join
the then-fledgling 24-hour news network by friends Daniel Schorr
and George Watson, the Washington bureau chief.
   The next year, John Hinckley shot President Reagan outside a
Washington hotel where Reagan had just delivered a speech.
   Shaw had finished his news update summarizing the speech and
switched back to CNN headquarters in Atlanta when a staffer told
him someone had fired shots at the president's motorcade.
   ``I screamed to the control room to tell Atlanta to come back to
us right away,'' Shaw said. Shaw filled viewers in with the sketchy
information he had, then switched back to Atlanta, but Reese
Schoenfield, then president of CNN, ordered Atlanta to go back to
Washington and stay there.
   ``And they did, and there we were,'' said Shaw. He was on the
air for 10 hours.
   ``I was pretty conscious that day of my demeanor, tone of voice
and facial expressions,'' he said, ``because that camera magnifies
everything, and I was determined to be as low-key as possible, as
factual as possible and as dispassionate as possible. A story like
that requires no heat.''
   Low-key is the operative word in describing Shaw's style. He
considers the celebrity aspects of his job ``corruptive'' and
prefers to spend his free time with his wife, Linda, and their two
children. Besides ``doing better'' in his job at CNN, Shaw, 47,
says his only ambition is to write books, fiction and non-fiction.
   He's a perfectionist who constantly worries about improving his
performance and the network's. He said that when he left the air
after the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, he lay awake for hours
``replaying in my head what we did _ what we did right, what we did
wrong, what I could have done better.''
   ``He does his homework every time and worries over it like it's
his first time, and calls afterwards to be critiqued on it,'' said
CNN Executive Vice President Ed Turner. ``I don't know anybody as
good as he is, in my 30 years in the business, at his specialty,
which was a job once done brilliantly by (Walter) Cronkite, before
him by (Robert) Trout, people who can sit with a breaking story for
hours on end and never lose the various threads that you have to
keep hold of.''
   If it's grueling to be on the air for hours on end, it's also
fulfilling.
   While his colleagues at the other networks struggle to get even
an hour or two of prime-time coverage for the primaries, Shaw, who
anchors CNN's political coverage, gets the whole night.
   ``There was a magical moment, or hour, between 9 and 10 o'clock
in Manchester (N.H.),'' he recalled, ``and it seemed like every
candidate was coming down to the ballroom to make statements. And
it just looked like a visual ballet, where we went from Kemp to
Gephardt to Bush to Dole, or what have you. And I looked up on the
monitors, and we were the only ones on the air. And I felt good.''
