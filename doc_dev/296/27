   CBS and ABC, hoping to build new franchises with
news on weeknights, each announced plans Monday for late-night
newscasts.
   ABC's effort, which has yet to get final approval, is the most
ambitious.
   But CBS' half-hour show, co-anchored by Charles Kuralt and
Lesley tahl and starting at 11:30 p.m., will be the first to join
the late-night news wars. It will premiere Monday opposite ABC
News' ``Nightline'' series.
   ABC's pre-dawn broadcast, to run from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m., will
start Jan. 7 if plans are approved, said ABC News vice president
Joanna Bistany.
   Earlier Monday, ABC said the newscast was definite. But that was
premature, Bistany said.
   Neither show has been given a title yet.
   Kuralt will anchor his part of the new CBS show here, and
continue as anchor of CBS' ``Sunday Morning'' newcast. Stahl will
anchor from Washington, and continue as moderator of ``Face the
Nation'' on Sundays.
   Like ``Nightline,'' which began when Iran held hostages in the
U.S. Embassy in 1979, the new CBS show is the outgrowth of a Middle
East crisis, Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. That crisis has been
examined in six CBS specials since Aug. 29, all called ``Showdown
in the Gulf.''
   Unlike ``Nightline,'' which usually tackles a single topic each
night, the new series will examine several topics each night
through live interviews, extended news segments, and essays, CBS
News said.
   It also will report the latest developments in the U.S. and the
Middle East as long as the Persian Gulf crisis continues, CBS said.
   Whether it will continue beyond January, when CBS is scheduled
to start late-night entertainment programming at 11:30 p.m.,
depends on how well it is received by viewers, CBS News president
Eric Ober said.
   But if it does well, he said, there is a possibility it will
continue in the 11:30 p.m. time slot, with the new programming
pushed up to a midnight start time.
   CBS currently shows repeats of ``Wiseguy'' at 11:30 p.m. EDT.
But those will start a half-hour later when the new CBS News
program begins.
   ABC's potential broadcast was created in response to requests
from the network's more than 200 affiliates, which now air
syndicated programs, movies, or go dark during the pre-dawn hours.
   With two anchors to be named later, the ABC broadcast would have
live and taped segments, domestic and international news, sports
and weather in 30-minute packages.
   The main competition for ABC's pre-dawn show would be the Cable
News Network. In January, NBC News will start a new operation, the
24-hour NBC News Channel serving that network's affiliates with
international, national and regional news for use in their local
newscasts.
   NBC said Monday the operation will be based in Charlotte, N.C.
   CNN has been considering the idea of a late-night interview show
like ABC's ``Nightline.'' But it has yet to make a decision.
   ABC's new series also will rival the far smaller ``All News
Channel,'' another 24-hour news service. Begun last November and
co-owned by Conus Communications and Viacom, it serves broadcasters
in 25 markets, Conus says.
   Although CBS News has had ``Nightwatch,'' a taped interview
show, competing in the pre-dawn hours since October 1982, its new
half-hour series marks its entry in a time period where
entertainment has flopped for years.
   Two years ago, CBS put Pat Sajak's talk show on at 11:30 p.m.,
facing NBC's late-night ratings champ, Johnny Carson's ``Tonight
Show,'' ``Nightline,'' and Arsenio Hall's syndicated show.
   But ``The Pat Sajak Show'' proved a ratings bomb and was
cancelled in April after 15 months on the air.
