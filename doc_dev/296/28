   Every night about midway through
``Panorama of the Day,'' one of Poland's most popular news
programs, a pert, blond American pops up on the screen and says, in
English, ``This is Headline News, I'm Bobbie Battista.''
   That one line has been enough to make the CNN anchor the
best-known American television personality in Poland, as she
learned as the official guest of Polish television recently.
   In Krakow, children clamored to find out the name of her
favorite rock star. In Czestochowa, monks lined up for her
autograph. And everywhere, her Polish fans wanted to know much
money an American anchor makes.
   Her celebrity status has both pleased and baffled the seven-year
CNN veteran. ``The viewers don't even see me that much every night
_ like for two minutes and I barely say anything,'' Battista said.
   Rarely, it seems, has the global network gotten so much for so
little.
   ``We're on in 60 countries at this point and we get letters from
all over the place, but nowhere has the impact been greater than in
Poland. ... I think it just goes with their fascination with
anything Western,'' she said.
   This April, CNN signed a deal with Poland under which its
broadcasts will be carried regularly on state-run television. Poles
privileged enough to own satellite dishes have been able to pick up
CNN in English for several years.
   Under the agreement, Polish television can use CNN's
international feed for domestic broadcast. The six-hour time
difference makes Battista's midday anchor shift in Atlanta an ideal
pickup for Panorama, which airs nightly at 9:30 p.m. in Warsaw.
   Each day, ``Panorama'' uses one CNN Headline News report, which
it intersperses with a similar report from the Soviet evening news
program, ``Vremya,'' in addition to clips from Polish TV.
   ``Above all, `Panorama' is able to present different points of
view of what is going on in the world. Even if the subjects are the
same, there is a different point of view,'' said Jozef Wegrzy, the
director of Polish television's second channel, which produces
``Panorama.''
   The international angle and the program's fast-paced formula
have earned it an average of 12 million viewers a night since it
went on the air just over a year ago.
   Polish TV tapes and translates the CNN report daily and has the
right to edit it. While still in Atlanta, Battista received a
couple of tapes of the program which the Poles had retranslated in
English and sent back to her.
   ``I was suprised a couple of times because I kind of looked at
the screen and thought, `That's not what I said.' So that's of some
concern. But for the most part, they're being pretty
straightforward with it,'' she said.
   On a recent visit, Battista the journalist became Battista the
CNN diplomat. She taped a talk show with Daniel Passent, editor of
the weekly Polityka and the show ``Closer to Your World,'' a
round-table discussion program that includes foreign journalists.
   It was a new role for a woman used to asking the questions, and
one that precluded her from making a pilgrimage to Gdansk to
interview Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, one person most first-time
journalists to Poland try to see.
   Despite her success as a television personality, Battista
appeared eager to get back on the other side of the camera.
   No doubt her Polish fans were eager as well. While she has been
visiting, ``Panorama'' was obliged to air its CNN segments without
her.
