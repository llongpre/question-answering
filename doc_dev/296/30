   CNN's broadcast Tuesday of Saddam Hussein's
latest meeting with Western hostages raised the question: Should
news operations give the Iraqi leader live access to U.S.
television?
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, deputy director of news at NBC. ``We made that decision
the first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure
propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
carried the Iraqi satellite transmission live on Tuesday, as the
Cable News Network did. Instead, they showed portions somewhat
later.
   But CNN management defended its practice, saying the meeting was
deemed of sufficient importance to air immediately.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said at the network's Atlanta headquarters.
In Tuesday's case, he said, CNN understood that Saddam would be
speaking with American hostages.
   ``There was no question in our minds this would be newsworthy,''
Haworth said.
   After the coverage, Pati Heath of Detroit, the sister of an
American hostage, called CNN to say she had seen her brother on TV.
CNN put her on television, too.
   She wasn't troubled by the dispute over CNN's programming
decision. ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,''
she said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.'
   CNN noted that it was relaying an Iraqi TV feed. Afterward, the
network aired a debate on the wisdom of its decisions.
   It is, by all accounts, a somewhat sticky question.
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins,
director of news information for ABC in New York. The president of
ABC News has to approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television Thursday with Western
hostages, ABC broadcast the Iraqi satellite feed for a few moments
after first viewing the transmission to gauge its content.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Tuesday, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report, she said.
   NBC regards the question of whether to air Iraqi feeds as a
cut-and-dried journalistic issue, McFarland said from NBC's New
York headquarters.
   ``We would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first knowing
what it was,'' he said. ``We took every frame of it into the house,
looked at it, and then selected two or three bites.''
   CBS officials didn't respond Tuesday to a request for comment.
