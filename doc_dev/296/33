   The Cable News Network will provide live
coverage of Wednesday's scheduled landing of the space shuttle
Discovery, network executives said Tuesday.
   CNN will open its live coverage with a live report at 9 a.m. EDT
from the landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
Then CNN will go live to cover the landing itself, scheduled for
9:57 a.m. EDT.
   ABC and CBS will air their regularly scheduled programs, ready
to go live in the event of an emergency, officials of those
networks said.
   NBC said it would have live coverage of the landing only on the
West Coast, where its ``Today'' show would be on the air.
