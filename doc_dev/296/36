</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable News Network anchor Bernard Shaw, still in Beijing, spent Sunday fully 
expecting the authorities to cut all phone lines out of China, severing the 
last link of live reports by foreign broadcasters there. 
</P>
<P>
And then, he said in a late-night phone interview as Army troops massed to 
clear Tian An Ming Square of hundreds of thousands of protesters, "We just sit 
here until the government feels it has control of the situation and can loosen 
the screws." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Dan Rather, meanwhile, arrived home in New York, instructed by his bosses 
to leave Beijing Saturday when, he said, it appeared the airport might be shut 
down. He stopped in Tokyo to drop off news footage taped before and after 
authorities ordered CBS and CNN to shut down their portable transmitters and 
pulled the plug for NBC and ABC at the state-run China Central Television 
satellite uplink station. 
</P>
<P>
The live shots of the CBS and CNN shutdowns Friday night -- CNN was first to go 
at 7:05 p.m. PDT (11:05 a.m. Saturday in Beijing), followed by CBS at 8:49 p.m. 
PDT -- dramatically symbolized the news dimout for American and other foreign 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
But their reports continued by phone, with their networks showing photos of the 
reporters, maps of Beijing, pre-shutdown tapes or fresh footage taped despite 
severe restrictions by Chinese authorities and "pigeoned" out of Beijing by 
departing staffers or travelers. 
</P>
<P>
It all occurred in an extraordinary week for the networks -- one that began 
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's historic China visit, and evolved into 
high-tension confrontations that had exhausted reporters and producers working 
almost nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
It was a particularly extraordinary week for both Shaw and Rather. The latter, 
in addition to signing off Friday as CBS' plug was pulled, also anchored a "48 
Hours" special Thursday from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable -- we all came here to cover a summit and we walked into a 
revolution," Shaw told viewers shortly before CNN's satellite link was cut, 
preceded by dramatic split-screen shots of Jane Maxwell, CNN special events 
vice president in Atlanta, talking with officials in Beijing, trying to keep 
the video line open. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally expect next a cutting of all telephone communications out of here 
and a shutting down of the airport," Shaw said Sunday. "I just regard it as 
standard operating procedure." 
</P>
<P>
On CBS' Sunday newscast, CBS Beijing bureau chief John Sheahan, was reporting 
live by phone of the possibility of a "massacre" in the streets when army 
troops moved to clear Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Shaw said, the government had briefly jammed reception of 
network newscasts dealing with the China story. That stopped, he said, "but I 
expect it to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw and Rather were the only American network news anchors on the scene all 
week, NBC and ABC having decided to keep Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a story," said Rather, adding that he wanted to stay but that 
CBS officials, who only had 20 minutes to decide whether he should catch what 
might prove the last flight from Beijing for a while, told him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Rival ABC and NBC had correspondents reporting from Beijing, but the sounds of 
teeth gnashing in envy could be heard in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting our butts kicked," one stateside NBC producer moaned to a friend 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
For NBC, the timing of its keep-Brokaw-here decision was awkward. Friday's 
plug-pulling in Beijing came as NBC's affiliates were gathering in San 
Francisco for their annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC News President Michael Gartner didn't think the decision was a 
mistake."No, of course not," he said Saturday from San Francisco. Referring to 
NBC's staff in Beijing, including Asian veterans George Lewis and Kenley Jones, 
he said he was "happy with the work that everybody who's been over there. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
ABC sent a 30-man crew that among other things shot footage of CNN's 
plug-pulling, 20 seconds of which it provided CNN late Friday. But worried 
about a potentially explosive situation in Panama, the network kept Jennings 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Like others in CNN's 60-member delegation, Shaw, who celebrates his 49th 
birthday today, had averaged only about two or three hours of sleep a day, 
feeding the 24-hour-a-day network with constant updates watched closely by both 
American viewers and rival networks. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Sheahan, part of CBS' 60-member Beijing contingent, wasn't surprised that 
authorities ordered CBS' satellite uplink shut down hours before CBS' 
permission to use it expired. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, about 600 viewers in New York were outraged and called in 
complaints Friday night -- not about the government's action, but CBS' two live 
reports -- one for three minutes, then other for 18 minutes -- that interrupted 
the season-ending episode of "Dallas." Later, the broadcast of "Beauty and the 
Beast" in Los Angeles was interrupted for another 3-minute live report from 
Beijing that ended at 8:49 PDT, when a network technician flicked a switch and 
the screen faded to video snow. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests, Rather said he'd heard that one viewer called to say, "I 
was watching Dan Rather and he was interrupted by 'Dallas,' and what's going on 
here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, who with colleagues Mike Chinoy, Steve Hurst and producer Alec Miran 
worked in relays, wasn't surprised that phone links weren't shut down at the 
same time the government pulled the plug on video transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they want to get everything lined up" before they start quelling 
demonstrations, he said. "They want it to be precise . . . they want whatever 
they do to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
With phone links still open Friday night, it was possible for CNN's Beijing 
staff to Fax the government's official, written, earth-station shut-down order 
to CNN executive Jane Maxwell in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
She said the authorities threatened to confiscate CNN's satellite uplink if the 
order wasn't obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a real concern," she said Saturday, shortly after an ABC News crew, 
as part of its coverage of the story, taped an interview with her. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters in Beijing had another major concern when martial law was imposed 
Friday. It was Municipal Order No. 3, in which foreign reporters' movements 
were sharply restricted, and taping and interviews with Chinese forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
The movement restrictions, CBS bureau chief Sheahan said by phone Saturday, 
included barring reporters from Tian An Men Square, a 40-minute drive from the 
CBS encampment at a hotel with a now-ironic name -- the Shangri-La Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he'd met with no hostility from the students, their professors 
and ordinary residents of Beijing, even though on Saturday "they kept coming up 
to us and saying, 'Well, haven't you heard? You foreigners aren't allowed to be 
here, to take pictures.' 
</P>
<P>
"We'd ask, 'Do you want us to leave?' And they'd say, 'No, no, you must tell 
the world what's going on here.' "
