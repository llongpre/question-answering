   Cable News Network, which went after the big three
TV networks in 1980 with round-the-clock news, is preparing a
frontal assault with an hour-long newscast premiering next month.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth announced Tuesday the newscast will
be shown from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. EDT, possibly with CNN anchor Bernard
Shaw. But Haworth said, ``We have no decision on talent yet.''
   The program would be twice the length of the evening news on NBC,
ABC and CBS.
   CNN's newscasts are carried live in each time zone, meaning the
program would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast. The new show
will begin Oct., 16, he said.
   Haworth said the new program would be designed to ``go
head-to-head with the networks,'' which broadcast a half-hour of
news at 6:30 p.m. _ or 7 p.m. in some markets.
   ``Seventy percent of the people who watch the evening news watch
the 6:30 p.m. segment,'' Haworth said.
   CNN now runs its continuous news format in the 6-6:30 time period
and shows the entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30
p.m. EDT.
   Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge Catherine
Crier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co-anchor
the new evening news program was premature.
   ``We won't know anything about that until she actually joins
us,'' he said. ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When
she comes up with us, and starts doing some training, we'll start
figuring what anchor role she'll be playing with us.''
   CNN started in June 1980. It has sports, commentary, talk and
specialty shows, but the bulk of its 24-hour schedule is news.
