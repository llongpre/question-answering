   This weekend, network anchors and correspondents
will go down to the sea in ships _ Soviet and American guided
missile cruisers _ for the summit meeting of President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The warship setting in Malta may be reminiscent of August 1941,
when President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston
Churchill met aboard warships in Newfoundland for a meeting that
produced the Atlantic Charter.
   But now, as then, the Fourth Estate won't need sea legs. As in
1941, the ships involved in a historic meeting aren't far from
land, this time about 1,000 yards offshore in the harbor at
Marsaxloc, on the south coast of Malta.
   This being the age of TV and satellites, those covering and
participating in the shipboard summits on Saturday and Sunday may
be able to see themselves on TV on the ships, the USS Belknap and
the Soviet navy's Slava.
   CNN, whose Washington-based anchor, Bernard Shaw, is among 60
Cable News Network staffers heading to Malta, is hoping to install
on each ship portable facilities to receive CNN's worldwide
newscasts, a spokesman here says.
   ``They're trying hard to set it up,'' he says. ``Obviously that
takes a little more effort, but that's what they're trying to do.''
   Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, the anchors of ABC,
CBS and NBC, respectively, also are making the voyage to Malta, the
point men of a three-network army totalling nearly 200 staffers
from Europe and the United States.
   Each anchor first will report from Rome on the meeting Friday
between Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II before moving on to Malta
and coverage of a summit in which the upheaval in Eastern Europe
may produce major news.
   The White House press center, the networks' command stations and
portable satellite transmission centers on Malta will be in its
capital city, Valletta, a few miles from the harbor in which the
shipboard meetings will occur.
   But Jeff Gralnick, Lane Venardos and Joe Angotti, the executives
in charge of the ABC, CBS and NBC expeditions, respectively, say
they don't expect any problems with getting live video signals from
the ships.
   Although anchoring newscasts from the ships is an unlikely
possibility, they say, they anticipate being able to send live
reports from the ships on their own, separate circuits via
microwave.
   Those transmissions and those of CNN then would be relayed to
Valletta _ where the network evening newscasts will be anchored _
for satellite feeds to the United States.
   ``I don't anticipate any difficulties,'' says Angotti. ``They
are making available to us pretty complete access to getting
pictures microwaved off of each of the ships.
   ``I expect that we'll have as much coverage of this summit as we
would on a land-based summit.''
   Saturday's opening day of talks is to be held aboard the Slava,
with Sunday's session aboard the Belknap. Developments from each
are to be reported live and on videotape as warranted.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to close their summit with a
joint statement, and then hold separate news conferences. The
networks expect to air all three events live, starting at 8 a.m.
EST on Sunday.
   The only big problem that CBS' Venardos says he worries about is
trying to get information when Bush, Gorbachev and their spokesmen
``are isolated on these ships.''
   At such times, he says, ``there's no way to pick up the phone''
and ask for the spokesmen. ``We have to wait until they come off
the ships to find out what happened. And so, the clamor for
information is going to be pretty loud down there, I think.''
   But each side seems eager to have this one of the most
accessible-to-television summits in recent history, he says.
   The networks' shipboard microwave transmission links can be shut
down at any time, Venardos says, but ``both sides have been
extraordinarily interested in having live television available on
this event ... the Russians no less than the Americans.''

   Elsewhere In Television:
   CAN WE TALK BICOASTAL? _ Pleased by the ratings for the ``The
Joan Rivers Show'' when it originated from Los Angeles last month,
Tribune Entertainment, which syndicates her New York-based weekday
series, is thinking of having it air from Los Angeles for three
months each year. Should this come to pass, says a spokesman for
Rivers' show, it would make her program ``the nation's first
bicoastal talk show in syndication.''
