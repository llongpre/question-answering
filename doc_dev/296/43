   It's 2 a.m. in Moscow and Peter Jennings ought to
be asleep, but he isn't. He's taping the evening news for ABC.
   In daylight hours, ABC's Pierre Salinger wanders around the
Hotel Rossiya with shirttail out; CBS's Charles Kuralt dashes
upstairs to file a story; columnist Roland Evans looks despairingly
for the CNN studio so he can interview Soviet spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov. And the gofers _ go for this, go for that _ are
everywhere.
   Like invading armies, the television networks have moved in,
bringing an entourage of hundreds and a mountain of
high-technology. Their beachhead is the Hotel Rossiya overlooking
Red Square and the Kremlin.
   And the toughest negotiations of the summit may have preceded
President Reagan's arrival here Sunday. The networks convinced
Soviet authorities to improve the lighting of Red Square for a
backdrop on the evening newscasts.
   Virtually every big-name network personality is vying for summit
air time.
   CBS's Dan Rather wants to put the summit in the context of
changes under way in the Soviet Union; ABC's Jennings did some
man-on-the-street interviews; Tom Brokaw of NBC has the only
terrace anchor station, and CNN is the only network shown in Soviet
hotels.
   The networks have brought their own satellite dishes, microwave
transmissions, walkie-talkies, telephones, electrical generators,
copying machines, Fax machines _ and, in some cases, shipped in
their food.
   ``Be Careful _ Radio Radiation,'' reads a sign in front of three
giant satellite dishes outside the Rossiya.
   ABC offered to provide its staff with smoke alarms at the
Rossiya, a 3,000-room hotel where more than 30 people were killed
in a fatal fire in 1977. It even has a daily newsletter for its
people, entitled ``Moscow Newsletter.''
   Uniformed Soviet officials pace up and down the Rossiya's halls,
where rooms are packed with televisions, monitors and other gear.
On the fifth floor, the networks built outdoor booths so reporters
can conduct interviews with the Kremlin wall and St. Basil's
Cathedral as a backdrop.
   NBC said it plans to broadcast its Nightly News live, while ABC
and CBS plan something called ``tape live,'' which provides a
slight delay. That's the middle of the night Moscow time.
   Thus the lighting of St. Basil's took on added import for the
networks. They entered into negotiations with the Kremlin, Moscow
city officials and Gostelradio, the Soviet broadcast network, and
the lighting crisis was resolved satisfactorily, said William Lord,
executive director at ABC-TV.
   Each network has about 100 people in Moscow, including
Russian-speaking American students who have been recruited to serve
as everything from office gofers to interpreters.
   But for all the trouble and expense, network executives say
serious summit scoops may be difficult to come by in the Soviet
Union, where bureaucrats and officials aren't as sensitive to the
demands of television.
   ``They are less responsive in terms of time,'' said Joe Angotti,
an NBC executive producer. Added CBS executive producer Lane
Vernardos: ``When in Rome, do as the Romans do does not work for
television.''
   With their own technology, television is able to transmit
directly to a satellite, and then back to the United States. ``We
are independent of the Soviets,'' Lord said.
   But while the American broadcasters, along with their European
and Japanese counterparts, have tried to stay clear of the Soviets,
network executives say the people at Gostelradio have given them
unprecedented leeway.
   ``They really want to cooperate and they are trying to be
flexible,'' said NBC's Angotti.
   Television reporters say the Soviets essentially have kept to
their pre-summit pledge that journalists ``can talk to anybody they
wish.'' They've interviewed dissidents, took trips outside Moscow
by train and talked with students at Moscow State University.
   ``People are more willing to talk about more than they have been
before,'' Rather said.
   No one wants to say how much money they're spending on the
summit, but Tom Bettag, a CBS producer for the nightly news, thinks
it's going to be worth it.
   ``We've made a heavy commitment because other news is likely to
be slight,'' he said. ``Congress is on the Memorial Day vacation,
and there is a hole before the primaries so it will be extremely
quiet back home.''
