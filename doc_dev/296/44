   It's said that those who forget history are
doomed to watch it on cable.
   That isn't all bad. And if you're up for a first-rate new
history series, tune in tonight to the debut of ``The Road To War.''
   Airing on the A &amp; E Network, this eight-part series, a
co-production of A &amp; E and the BBC, studies the origins of World
War II in the two decades that preceded Hitler's invasion of Poland
in September 50 years ago.
   What makes this ``Road'' different from previous series about
the war, such as the excellent ``The World at War,'' is that it
examines the social and political events leading to World War II in
each major nation involved.
   Each nation gets a separate, one-hour look. In order of
appearance, they are Germany, Great Britain, Japan, the United
States, France, Italy, and the Soviet Union, with the final chapter
entitled ``Global War,'' a summing-up of sorts.
   Another plus: As tonight's opening ``Germany'' shows, the BBC
team has gone to extraordinary lengths not only to unearth rarely
seen newsreel and Nazi propaganda footage, but also appears to have
struck new, crisp-looking prints of them and restored as much as
possible their sound tracks.
   All that gives a strange sense of immediacy when woven in with
interviews of now-elderly Germans _ military men, diplomats,
civilians, even a benign-looking former Nazi storm trooper.
   They witnessed Hitler's rise to power, many met him, and, in the
case of one Socialist member of the Reichstag in 1932-33, went to a
concentration camp because of him.
   Older viewers will find familiar the documentary's re-telling of
how Germany's sufferings after its defeat in World War I led to the
political triumphs of Hitler and the Nazi Party, then his
persecution and murder of Jews, his lust for domination and war.
   But regardless of the age of the viewer, this chapter is still a
valuable history lesson, one made striking with Nazi ``newsreel''
footage that includes:
   _ Shots of storm troopers at night burning what a Nazi narrator
calls ``un-German and immoral books.''
   _ Pictures of fleeing refugees, identified as as ``ethnic
Germans ... being driven out of Poland'' _ the scenes staged to
incite German support of Hitler's propaganda, his claim that he had
cause to invade Poland.
   There's brilliant editing, too, in ``Germany,'' particularly
then-and-now scenes of Vienna. The contrasts are made as one hears
old recordings of Hitler's frenzied speeches after his
``unification'' of Austria and Germany in 1938.
   It's also very, very eerie and unsettling to hear a
well-dressed, obviously educated, now-60ish witness of those times
in Vienna, explain in her soft, matter-of-fact way, why she and
others there supported Hitler.
   One reason, she says without apparent shame or regret, ``was all
about the Jews ...'' It gets worse as she continues, saying,
``first of all, it was their behavior, and their appearance ...
they really didn't belong to Vienna, in a way.''
   Incredible.

   Elsewhere in television...
   HERE COMES THE JUDGE _ As expected, Cable News Network says that
Catherine Crier, a young former Texas district judge with no news
background, and veteran newsman Bernard Shaw will co-anchor its new
``The World Today'' one-hour weeknight newscast that premieres on
Monday.
   She will anchor from CNN's Atlanta headquarters, he from its
Washington bureau. Their new program, starting at 6 p.m. EDT each
weeknight, will be competing in its second half hour with the
nightly newscasts of CBS, NBC and ABC, but only in Eastern and
Central time zones.
   The big networks tape-delay their newscasts for broadcast on the
West Coast because of the three-hours-later time difference there.
CNN's new show, a spokeswoman says, will be fed live nationally,
with no tape-delay showings.
   ROAD TO PEACE _ Next Monday also is when CNN starts the sixth
and final week of its ``Waging Peace'' series of six-minute weekday
specials and half-hour Saturday roundups on the prospects for peace
around the globe.
   Two staffers on the series, Peter Arnett and Richard Blystone,
once reported on the Vietnam War for The Associated Press, Arnett
for a number of years. It must be a strange feeling to be a peace
correspondent now ...
