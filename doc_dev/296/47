<LEADPARA>  STARTING coverage of a war in the Persian Gulf will be relatively simple for
the networks. They'll go on the air, stay on the air and throw all their
resources at the story.;    Stopping the coverage -- in order to air
entertainment shows -- will be more difficult. One network executive called it
"an excruciating decision," one that will be made at the highest levels in
consultation with news executives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, said Tuesday: "That decision won't be made
by me. But as long as the war is hot and unresolved, I will be hammering away
at the network to stay on the air. I don't think the American people will be
interested in anything else.";    But the problem is that despite all the
time, effort and money that ABC, CBS and NBC have spent preparing for a war,
the networks are not in the business of covering news round-the-clock.;   
They will broadcast almost nothing but war coverage for two days, three days,
perhaps even a week, but they will have to return to entertainment programming
at some point.;    The question is: When? And who will be the first to blink,
to leave the Persian Gulf for "Designing Women," "Cheers" or "Roseanne"? And
how many viewers will then defect to cable's CNN, which is committed to news
24 hours a day?;    "I almost feel sorry for the guys with half an hour," said
Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president for news gathering. "Almost.";    To
be fair, the Big Three networks have more than half an hour, the average time
for most evening newscasts. They have morning programs as well as their
evening newscasts, prime-time shows such as CBS's "60 Minutes" and ABC's
"20/20" and late-night shows, led by ABC's "Nightline.";    But they also face
economic pressures to resume the broadcast of profit-making entertainment
shows -- although network executives downplay the role that such factors will
play in their decision-making.;    No follow the leader;  Eric Ober, president
of CBS News, said Tuesday: "Events will dictate how long we are on the air. I
don't think the decision on whether to cut away or not will be related to
whether the other guys have cut away or not.;    "I've spent a lot of time in
control rooms," Ober added, "and I think the issue of different news
organizations looking at monitors to see who goes off first is overblown.";   
Ober said that the initial CBS war coverage would be commercial-free but that
commercials would be shown "as the flow of information stabilizes. I suspect
that commercials would appear relatively early in the coverage.";    The last
time the networks interrupted regular programming for such an extended time
was in 1963, when they provided four days of continuous coverage of the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. That story, however, had an end:
the president's funeral.;    This time, indications are that the networks will
slowly return to normalcy only after the first wave of continuous coverage.
One option at NBC News, for example, calls for a "Today" show that could run
until noon, a 90-minute version of "Nightly News," a late-night wrap-up and
bulletins as warranted. CBS's Andrew Heyward, executive producer of "48
Hours," said that show will be devoted to gulf coverage for the duration of
the crisis, beginning with a special edition Tuesday night.;    Ratings show
that viewer appetite for such coverage remains strong. Network news ratings
were up by about 10 percent last week. Ratings were also higher than usual for
Sunday's "60 Minutes" and other prime-time specials about the gulf.;    In
Hollywood, though, network programmers have already begun to think about the
best ways to ease out of war coverage. Robert Iger, president of ABC
Entertainment, said his network has begun to look for entertainment shows that
could be scheduled before or after news specials.;    "What do you put in the
middle of two hours of coverage on the bombing of Baghdad, for instance?" Iger
asks. "Can you go to a 'Roseanne' show after that? What shows do we have in
the can that we can put on in and about that coverage? I think we have to be
particularly sensitive. It's difficult to imagine putting on sitcoms.";   
Pentagon sets rules;  CBS News' Ober also addressed two other concerns for all
the networks -- Pentagon restrictions on coverage and the safety of
correspondents still based in Iraq.;    Ober said he was surprised that more
public attention had not been paid to Pentagon rules on war coverage, which
require all combat reporters to be accompanied by military escorts and all
stories to come under security reviews. "Journalists being allowed to cover
news properly is an important issue," he said. "Some of the questions that
still hang over how many people died in Panama and what really happened in
Grenada are because the military drastically restricted press access.";   
Ober also said CBS correspondent Allen Pizzey, his producer and his crew will
remain in Baghdad for as long as Pizzey chooses to. Ober acknowledged the
dangers of the situation and what he called "the seeming anomaly of having
reporters, in effect, reporting from the other side" but said all the
reporters still in Iraq are there willingly, with full awareness of the risks
involved.;    All the network anchors will stay extremely close to their desks
from now on. NBC's Brokaw said his mind is focused, not only on the coverage,
but on the fate of Americans and others in gulf.;    "I've now been to Saudi
Arabia three times," said Brokaw, who spent last weekend in the gulf region.
"I've seen those kids. I worry about them a lot. And you worry about the
consequences to others, even the Iraqis, some of whom are certainly innocents.
No matter what they say, there's no such thing as a surgical air strike.;   
"Simultaneously, you're thinking, 'Let me do this in a way that those people
who turn to NBC News have a clear idea of what's going on.' " He said it's
important to "communicate a sense of urgency about the situation" but also to
remain calm and measured.  </TEXT>
