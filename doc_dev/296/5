   Cable News Network today said it is considering an
evening newscast to compete directly with the big three TV networks.
   The idea under consideration calls for a newscast at 6 p.m. or
6:30 p.m. EDT ``to go head-to-head with the networks,'' and CNN
anchorman Bernard Shaw could have a role on the program, CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But he said CNN officials haven't made a final determination of
whether a frontal assault on Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan
Rather would be a good idea.
   ``There are a number of changes we're talking about, and that's
one of the changes,'' he said.
   The proposal calls for a half-hour, stand-alone newscast, unlike
CNN's virtually 24-hour, all-news format, in which the news is
continuously updated.
   CNN currently runs news in the 6-6:30 period and shows the
entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30 p.m., when
NBC, ABC and CBS air the first of their evening news feeds, or
transmissions to affiliate stations. The networks also produce an
updated feed at 7 p.m.
   Haworth said speculation that Catherine Crier would be co-anchor
of the program was premature. The Texas judge was hired Monday as a
newscaster.
   ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When she comes
up with us, and starts doing some training, we'll start figuring
what anchor role she'll be playing with us,'' he said.
