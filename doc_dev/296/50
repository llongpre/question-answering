   The four major American television networks
showed videotape Monday purportedly of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
hanging from a gallows, though one used only freeze-frames of the
grisly image.
   Cable News Network and CBS showed the video on afternoon
newscasts, while ABC and NBC broadcast still pictures from the
tape. NBC later showed the videotape on ``NBC Nightly News.''
   ``It is not gratuitous violence,'' said Steve Haworth, spokesman
for CNN. He said editors considered, ``Is this stark video
necessary to tell the story? And in fact it is. Everybody came to
the same conclusion.''
   CNN Anchor Ralph Wenge warned viewers the tape was ``very
graphic.''
   On NBC, afternoon viewers of special reports and short ``news
digests'' saw still frames of the man's head and torso.
   ``We felt that the picture we showed captured the essence of
what was claimed to be happening,'' said Donald Browne, executive
director of NBC News.
   Browne said the network showed only still pictures initially
because it had had little time to study the full video and because
viewers do not expect to see something so graphic when regular
programming is interrupted.
   It went ahead with the video in the evening because ``people
expect in a story like that to see graphic material,'' he said.
   The network sent the full tape to affiliates, should they decide
to use more, he said.
   For a special report on ABC during the day, ``There was an
editorial decision not to show the videotape, just the still,''
said spokesman Scott Richardson.
   ABC's evening newscast again only showed still pictures because,
as news anchor Peter Jennings told viewers, the only difference was
that the video ``shows that Col. Higgins was swinging on his
makeshift gallows when the tape was made.''
   ``Our view of showing it is simply based on a gut reaction _ no
need for us to help demean Col. Higgins by watching him swing,'' he
added.
