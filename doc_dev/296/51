   The major television networks have moved to
Moscow for a superpower summit that may end up producing more pomp
than news.
   President Reagan arrived early Thursday in Finland for a
four-day stopover en route to the Soviet Union. He arrives in
Moscow on Sunday for his fourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Reagan and Gorbachev had hoped to use the summit to sign a
treaty reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons, but
negotiations over the pact have stalled over the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative _ Star Wars _ and verification issues.
   ``It's clear both sides are prepared to accentuate the positive,
orchestrate the ceremonial side of the summit,'' said CBS anchor
Dan Rather. ``I think there'll be a lot of smiles, a lot of toasts
and a lot of talk about promise in the future and great beginnings.
   ``But one of the jobs of a reporter is to separate bullshine
from brass tacks. Unless something changes, it's going to be more
of the former and less of the latter.
   ``But the ceremonial stuff, it'll be terrific,'' he said. ``The
Russians are pretty good at great ceremony.''
   This will be the first visit by the 77-year-old Reagan to the
country he once called an evil empire, and it's the first visit of
an American president to the Soviet Union in 14 years.
   CBS started its pre-summit coverage Wednesday night with Rather
anchoring the ``CBS Evening News'' from Moscow. Features will
include a series of ``On the Road'' segments by correspondent
Charles Kuralt on the Transiberian Express. While Rather is in
Moscow, Bob Schieffer will hold down the fort in New York. ``He's
hoping news breaks out somewhere else,'' joked Rather.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' with Peter Jennings also began
broadcasting from Moscow on Wednesday.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw will originate from Moscow
beginning Monday. All the nightly newscasts will come from Moscow
through Wednesday, then move for the last two nights of the week to
London to assess European response to the superpower summit.
   PBS' Robert MacNeil, co-anchor of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' will report from Moscow each night of the summit through
June 2. Jim Lehrer will anchor in Washington.
   CNN's senior Washington anchor Bernard Shaw will anchor coverage
from Moscow with frequent live updates and coverage of arrivals,
departures, major remarks, speeches and photo opportunities.
   For cable viewers who want to see the Soviet angle on the story,
The Discovery Channel plans to air the hour-long Soviet news show
``Vremya'' each night of the summit at 9 p.m. EDT.
   ABC, NBC and CNN plan to have live coverage of Reagan's arrival
in Moscow on Sunday beginning at 6 a.m. EDT. ``CBS Sunday Morning''
will have a report on the arrival at 9 a.m. EDT.
   NBC's ``Sunday Today'' with Garrick Utley and Maria Shriver will
also originate from Moscow on Sunday. NBC will have a special
one-hour ``Meet the Press'' Sunday with Chris Wallace, Tom Brokaw
and John Chancellor. ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' will
feature an interview with National Security advisor Colin Powell in
a 90-minute special.
   All the weekday morning shows will have one co-anchor in Moscow
_ Bryant Gumbel for NBC's ``Today,'' Charles Gibson for ``Good
Morning America'' on ABC and Kathleen Sullivan for ``CBS This
Morning.''
   NBC additionally plans five-minute updates daily at noon during
the summit, and ABC says it plans occasional cut-ins during the day
for live coverage of significant remarks or news conferences.
   ABC's ``Nightline'' plans to link up with a Soviet news show one
night of the summit.
