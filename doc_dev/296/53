<LEADPARA>  AIDS protesters interrupted the first feed of the "CBS Evening News" seen live
in the East and Midwest Tuesday night, chanting "Fight AIDS not Arabs.";   
Other protesters from the group ACT-UP appeared across town in New York at the
"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," with one of them reportedly chaining himself
briefly to the desk of anchor Robert MacNeil.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The protesters at both studios were removed by security guards and turned
over to police. Officials at ABC, NBC and CNN were said to have increased
security in the wake of the incidents.;    The voices of three unidentified
men were heard over the theme music and anchor Dan Rather's introduction at
the start of the CBS broadcast, done at 3:30 PST.;    The face of one of the
protesters appeared momentarily in front of Rather's as the anchor calmly
said, "We're going to take a break for a commercial just now. We'll break for
a commercial.";    The screen went black for several seconds before Rather
returned to say, "Sorry about that. We're going to take things again right
from the top.";    CBS viewers on the West Coast, including those in the Bay
Area, did not see what happened, since stations here carry the second feed of
the broadcast, done right after the first at 4 p.m. PST. CNN, however, carried
tape of the incident across the country, as did CBS affiliate KPIX (Ch. 5)
locally.;    Rather acknowledged the interruption on the later broadcast.;   
CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said she did not know how the protesters got into
the studio on Manhattan's West Side or whether they belonged to any organized
group, but it was believed they were also members of ACT-UP, a militant AIDS
activist group.;    Viewers heard protesters, but didn't see them on
"MacNeil/Lehrer," which is done in both Manhattan and Washington.;    Jim
Lehrer in Washington asked MacNeil what was going on when sounds of the
commotion could be heard on the air and when he replied that demonstrators
were in the studio, the show went to a taped story while the protesters were
removed.;    Not quite the whole story;  Meanwhile, coverage of the Gulf War
continued Tuesday on all the networks, now under new censorship rules in
Israel and Saudi Arabia.;    CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said live reports
from the network's Tel Aviv bureau aired with an Israel censor off-camera,
ready to black out anything he didn't like. Military censors are now stationed
at network bureaus in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.;    This was graphically
demonstrated after the latest Iraqi attack on the city Tuesday evening Israeli
time.;    Reporter Richard Roth told viewers at first he could only say there
had been "casualties in the greater Tel Aviv area.";    When he was asked by
an anchor in Atlanta if he could be more specific about where the missile hit,
Roth turned to the censor and said, "Let's test this right away. Can I say
this is a residential area?";    The censor said he could and Roth then said
that, and mentioned the censor's approval on later reports on the attack.;   
Tape of the bloody incident appeared with the words, "Cleared by Israeli
censors" superimposed across the bottom of the screen for several seconds at
the start.;    Similar tags have appeared in front of tape shot in Saudi
Arabia, whose government is also clearing video before it is sent out by
satellite.;    In both countries, officials are worried that reporting precise
locations of Scud missile hits will aid the Iraqis in aiming their rockets.;  
 The U.S. military also has rules about that, which read in part, "Information
on the effectiveness of . . . direct and indirect fire . . . is not
reportable. It could jeopardize and endanger lives.";    In a related
development, the Saudis ordered network "pool" cameras off the top of the roof
of the primary press hotel in Dhahran, site of the biggest military airport in
the country.;    The camera was moved to a lower floor after the Saudis cited
security reasons. They made a similar demand in the capital city of Riyadh,
but later allowed that camera to stay on the roof, but it was not known why
they changed their mind there.  </TEXT>
