   Space shuttle launches had become such a matter
of course by the morning the Challenger lifted off 2{ years ago,
only the Cable News Network and NBC's West Coast version of
``Today'' had live coverage.
   The network news divisions have rediscovered the space program _
if only temporarily _ and will all have live coverage of the
Discovery launch, scheduled for 9:59 a.m. EDT Thursday. Even the
network anchors will be on the scene in Florida.
   ``If they go back to taking off like 747s heading for Paris,
we'll go back to a protective stance fairly quickly, I would think.
But this is a major first, and it's going to be covered very much
like the first shuttle launch,'' said ABC News Vice President Jeff
Gralnick.
   ``It's the U.S. going for the gold,'' said Ed Turner, executive
vice president of CNN. ``It's a huge gamble to re-establish
ourselves as a force in space.''
   Presuming a smooth launch, the networks probably will not stay
on the air for more than an hour or so. ABC and CBS are going on at
9:30 a.m. NBC, which is covering the Olympics, will break in just
before launch.
   The attention to Discovery is natural, since it is the first
manned U.S. space shot since Challenger, but it remains to be seen
whether the networks will continue to find the launches compelling
enough for live coverage. CNN will continue to cover space shots
live, since they are, as Turner said, ``a natural'' for an all-news
network.
   ``What I'm curious about is how sustained will the interest
be,'' he said. ``Will the interest, as reflected by the television
ratings, be for just that one spike, or will there be sustained
interest in the space program as it once had? I tend to think there
won't be. We've sort of done it before, and this is a return to
glories past. Nonetheless, we're covering the hell out of this
thing.''
   Though they didn't go live nationally in 1986, the other
networks had protective coverage in case anything went awry. When
Challenger exploded, they immediately broke into regularly
scheduled programming and stayed on the air for hours as the
tragedy sank into the public consciousness. The coverage cost the
networks a combined $9 million in lost advertising revenues.
   ``We had begun to believe, and I think we were wrong in
believing this, that shuttle launches were becoming routine,'' said
Lloyd Siegel, executive producer of NBC News' special coverage.
   ``While everyone has every expectation that this launch and
succeeding launches will be safe and successful, Challenger showed
us you cannot take this sort of thing for granted.''
