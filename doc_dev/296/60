   The Democrats tailored their convention to
network prime time, all right, down to casting a new television
star.
   Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards' keynote address was the
highlight of the opening session of the Democratic National
Convention on Monday night. The speech soothed fears, at least for
the night, that television coverage of the event was going to be
dull as dishwater after Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis patched
up their differences Monday morning.
   The convention even ended virtually on time, running only about
10 minutes over the 11 p.m. EDT scheduled close.
   Richards' 30-minute address was down-home, funny and
sentimental. It could have been a network sitcom. In fact, with her
Southern twang, viewers tuning in for CBS' ``Designing Women,''
which the speech pre-empted, might not have noticed the difference.
   Only CBS' Diane Sawyer got to Richards for an interview after
her speech. Richards said she ``didn't think my eye contact with
the camera was all that great,'' but otherwise thought she did all
right.
   Former President Jimmy Carter's ascension to the platform _ this
time he got prime-time treatment, unlike 1984 _ was an emotional
high point, though his speech was lackluster after Richards.
   Until Richards' speech, the name of the game Monday night for
the networks was get Dukakis and Jackson.
   NBC even went on the air a half-hour earlier than the scheduled
9 p.m. to be first with live interviews of the two principals. ABC
stuck to its plan to open with Dukakis at 9. CBS started with a
Dukakis interview taped minutes earlier.
   Only NBC viewers saw the nice bit of Americana that opened
prime-time coverage of the session _ Garrison Keillor and a group
of elementary-school children saying the pledge of allegiance and
singing the national anthem. NBC went a tad high on the
cute-o-meter, though, with cutaways to Tom Brokaw and John
Chancellor joining in.
   Despite a barrage of network interviews throughout the night,
Dukakis and Jackson revealed little about the behind-the-scenes
bargaining that led to their reconciliation.
   CNN's Bernard Shaw was admirably dogged, though. ``Sir, I cannot
turn this loose,'' he told Dukakis. ``You still haven't told me,
you haven't told our viewers what you two agreed to.'' To no avail.
   Until the Dukakis-Jackson summit meeting and subsequent news
conference on Monday, it seemed Jackson's resentment at not being
chosen running mate might turn into some newsworthy controversy at
the otherwise well-planned convention.
   ``If it weren't for Jesse Jackson, we wouldn't have anything,''
ABC's Brit Hume had said Sunday.
   ``Do you have a plane ticket to Miami?'' quipped NBC's Dennis
Murphy on Monday.
   Things went smoothly Monday night for network floor reporters
who had anticipated the worst in the small, crowded Omni Arena,
though when ABC's Peter Jennings remarked that it looked reasonably
roomy down there, Jeff Greenfield replied: ``There will be no
walkout at this convention. It would take five pounds of axle
grease to get anybody out of here.''

   CBS, in contract negotiations with legendary anchor Walter
Cronkite, is being careful to make him feel wanted during the
convention. During a weekend special, Cronkite and Dan Rather made
their first network appearance together since Cronkite suggested he
would have fired Rather for causing the network to go black for six
minutes last fall.
   Despite the tension, Rather was especially cordial, even shaking
Cronkite's hand and referring to him as ``colleague and mentor.''
On Monday night, Cronkite's commentary led off CBS' convention
coverage and closed it, though the Atlanta affiliate and probably
many others didn't come back for the wrap-up because the coverage
cut into local news time. CBS also has war horse Eric Sevareid on
hand.

   Dukakis and Jackson are not the only sought-after interviewees
at the convention. There are dozens of local television stations at
the convention, and the network anchors have at least a dozen
requests each from local affiliates who want the big guy on the
local news.

   Media quotes du jour:
   _``It's become like the boat show, or the auto show.'' _ CBS'
Bob Schieffer on the conventions.
   _``The only thing this thing doesn't do is crawl on its belly
like a reptile.'' _ CNN's Bernard Shaw describing ``the podium that
ate the convention.''
   _``People have even seen you save a LifeSaver, take it out
before a speech and pick it up again afterward.'' NBC's Tom Brokaw
asking Michael Dukakis about his reputation for penny-pinching.
   _``Nobody pays much attention to platforms at these things _ and
why should they?'' _ CBS' Dan Rather on the platform, the major
business in prime time tonight.
