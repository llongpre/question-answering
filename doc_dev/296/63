   Weary network crews trudged home today after
following their anchormen from Czechoslovakia to Rome to Malta,
where they covered a summit whose storms threatened to upstage the
superpowers.
   At one point Saturday night, CBS anchor Dan Rather warned that
``if the weather doesn't improve, this thing's going to be a
wreck.''
   But from the TV standpoint, the only thing wrecked at the summit
was a small studio CNN had built near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking
the harbor site of the shipboard meetings of President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   A CNN spokesman said the structure was demolished by Saturday's
storm, which forced the cancellation of the day's second planned
meeting of the two leaders and sent network staffs scurrying to
reshape their coverage.
   CNN anchor Bernard Shaw had to remain with the other anchors in
the city of Valetta, six miles away. But that was only one of CNN's
problems.
   Saturday's 60 mph winds blew down and damaged a CNN satellite
dish, knocking out CNN's signal for eight hours. But a spokesman
said no transmissions had been planned during the period of the
blackout, which began at 9 p.m. EST.
   The storm also briefly affected ABC. Rain shorted out an
electrical connection at the start of anchor Peter Jenning's live
summit report from Malta during the first of two ``World News
Tonight'' broadcasts that ABC sends its affiliates each night.
   But the Maltese connection was quickly restored. Jennings came
back on with his report eight minutes later.
   The storm didn't much affect CBS and NBC coverage of Saturday's
summit, to which the four U.S. networks brought a total of nearly
200 staff members.
   On Sunday, the weather was much better. But an electronic
problem caused a translation problem for NBC and CNN during the
live telecast of the superpower leaders' joint news conference
aboard the safely docked Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky.
   The Soviets provided the TV pool feed for broadcasters and an
audio channel offering a simultaneous English translations of
Gorbachev's remarks.
   However, during the last half hour of the session, an electronic
glitch knocked out the English-language channel. CBS and ABC had
translators standing by, so viewers didn't miss anything.
   NBC hastily summoned a Soviet official on Malta, but missed
eight minutes of translation.
   CNN went the long way for help. After 13 minutes in which Shaw
recapped summit news while Gorbachev was speaking, an American
woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's comments.
She was Siobahn Darrow, translating from CNN headquarters in
Atlanta, a CNN spokeswoman said.
   The summit capped a busy week for the networks, during which
their anchors were based in Prague, Rome, and in the case of ABC,
West Germany.
