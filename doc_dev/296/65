   Weather-weary network crews packed their gear
and left Malta on Sunday after storms there caused hasty changes
and technical problems in their coverage of the summit meeting.
   CBS and NBC coverage Saturday of the meeting between President
Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't much affected,
despite heavy wind and stormy seas that ended plans for afternoon
and dinner meetings that day.
   But the day's 60 mph wind destroyed a studio set CNN had built
near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard
summit, and also blew down and damaged a CNN satellite dish.
   That knocked out CNN's TV signal for eight hours, starting at 9
p.m. EST, although a network spokesman in Malta said most of the TV
blackout occurred when little was going on and no transmissions
were planned.
   Saturday's storm also affected ABC, but only briefly. Rain
shorted out an electrical connection right at the start of ABC
anchorman Peter Jenning's live summit report from Malta during the
first of two ``World News Tonight'' broadcasts that ABC sends its
affiliates each night.
   The broadcast was hurriedly reshaped in Washington while still
on the air. Anchorwoman Carole Simpson reported other news while
the Malta connection was restored, and Jennings came back on with
his report eight minutes later.
   The four networks' anchormen all were in Malta. But only
Jennings was heading to Brussels on Sunday to report Monday night
on Bush's post-summit briefing to NATO leaders. CBS' Dan Rather and
NBC's Tom Brokaw were reported returning to New York, and CNN's
Bernard Shaw was en route to Washington.
   Before Saturday's storm, the networks had planned to transmit
live TV pictures by microwave from the planned sites of the summit
_ two guided missile cruisers, the U.S. Navy's Belknap and the
Soviet navy's Slava.
   But when the storm forced the summit site changed to the safely
docked Soviet luxury ship Maxim Gorky, CBS, running the TV pool for
the U.S. networks, had to scramble to install a microwave linkup to
the Gorky.
   ``They (the Soviets) invited the pool to put a microwave aboard.
... We had to rip things apart to do that,'' Don DeCesare, CBS
News' director of news coverage, said Saturday night from Malta.
``It took all day to do it.''
   But just as technicans had things working, he said, Saturday's
planned second meeting between Bush and Gorbachev was called off.
   The leaders' Sunday news conference on the Gorky was televised
live, with the Soviets providing both the TV pool feed for
broadcasters and an audio channel offering a simultaneous English
translations of Gorbachev's remarks.
   But broadcast woes continued. During the session's last half
hour, an electronic glitch knocked out the English-language audio
channel.
   CBS and ABC continued with their own backup Russian-speaking
translators. NBC hastily brought in a Soviet official on Malta to
help, but missed eight minutes of translation.
   CNN went the long way for help _ to Atlanta. After 13 minutes in
which Shaw recapped summit news while Gorbachev was speaking, an
American woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's
comments.
   The woman was Siobahn Darrow, a CNN staff member. A spokeswoman
said Darrow was listening to and translating Gorbachev's remarks
from CNN headquarters in Atlanta.
