the Brink of War," will air at 8:30 p.m. PST on KQED, Ch. 9.;    ABC's
"Nightline," with Ted Koppel anchoring from Amman, Jordan, and CBS' "America
Tonight" will have special one-hour editions that start at 11:30 p.m.;    NBC

respectively. CBS' "48 Hours" will devote its entire program at 8 p.m.
Wednesday to the crisis, the network said.;    With the title of "Deadline in
the Desert," all of CNN's regular programs tonight will concern the gulf
crisis. The late-night "Moneyline" and "Sports Tonight" shows will be
pre-empted for crisis coverage.;    At 10 p.m. PST today, an hour after the
deadline set by the United Nations for Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait has
passed, CNN plans a special version of its "Crisis Conference" in which
viewers can call in and question CNN correspondents covering the crisis.  </TEXT>
