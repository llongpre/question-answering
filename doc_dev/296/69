   The three major networks ran their evening
broadcasts from the Berlin Wall, but NBC anchor Tom Brokaw got
there first, helping NBC bounce back from its embarrassing early
coverage of the San Francisco earthquake.
   On Friday night ABC's Peter Jennings and CBS' Dan Rather were
also on the scene to report on East Germany's historic lifting of
travel restrictions.
   Brokaw got there Thursday night, heisting a chunk of broken
Berlin Wall in front of cheering Berliners for a special broadcast,
and also reported Friday morning for ``Today.''
   Jennings and Rather flew to Berlin after their Thursday
newscasts from New York.
   ``It's terrific, terrific,'' NBC affiliate board chairman James
R. Sefert said of Thursday's ``NBC Nightly News'' coverage, and the
16-minute late-night special.
   NBC affiliates got a six-page letter from NBC News president
Michael Gartner explaining what went wrong with the network's quake
coverage on Oct. 17 and what has been done to correct problems that
arose.
   Although it later drew praise for its all-night coverage of the
quake story, NBC initially lagged behind its rivals with reports
and pictures from the scene, and for a time broadcast incorrectly
that a second freeway had collapsed in the quake.
   Almost as embarrassing, a number of NBC stations that also are
affiliated with Cable News Network used CNN's live quake coverage
until NBC finally began its all-out coverage from the stricken city.
   Those stations that turned to CNN _ which says it now serves 49
NBC affiliates _ included WTHR-TV in Indianapolis, Ind., whose
vice-president, Michael J. Corken, heads the news subcommittee of
NBC's affiliates board.
   Corken, who said Friday he'd messaged Gartner and NBC president
Robert C. Wright that NBC's Berlin Wall coverage ``is superb,
absolutely superb,'' said he had received Gartner's letter.
   ``The gist of the letter was that a lot of things went wrong
simultaneously and that some are fixable,'' Corken said.
   In his report, Gartner blamed part of the delay on quake damage
that knocked NBC's San Francisco's affiliate, KRON-TV, off the air
longer than other stations, thus delaying NBC's reports from the
scene.
   However, he also said that ``I shoulder whatever blame should
assigned for our not having our top-of-the-line talent readily
available and for not ensuring that the entire staff was up to the
task of handling an emergency.
   ``I have made several changes in these and other areas, and I am
dedicated to ensuring that nothing like this will ever happen
again.''
