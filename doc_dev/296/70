<LEADPARA>  After winning extravagant praise from the Bush administration for its first
week of war reporting, CNN was accused Wednesday by the White House of
broadcasting what amounts to Iraqi propaganda.;    CNN's Peter Arnett, the
only U.S. network correspondent still in Iraq, reported that allied air
strikes had obliterated an Iraqi baby-formula factory. The administration said
the factory was a front for a heavily guarded biological weapons facility
surrounded by barbed wire.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Any reports coming out of Baghdad are, in effect, coming from the Iraqi
government," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. "Any broadcasts
coming out of Baghdad are coming out of there totally controlled by the Iraqi
government.";    In fact, reports from Baghdad, Israel and Saudi Arabia are
all subject to censorship by the Iraqi, Israeli and U.S. military authorities
respectively, with reporters limited as to where they can go, who they can
talk to and what they can film and write.;    Fitzwater said the Iraqis were
using CNN as a conduit for "disinformation.";    He contended vehemently that
the bombed building was a biological-weapons facility that "has been heavily
guarded and has barbed wire," part of a "well-known tactic" of the Iraqis to
use "a lot of disguises" for weapons facilities.;    In CNN's report, first
aired at 3:37 a.m. Wednesday, Arnett said Iraqi officials Tuesday took him on
a tour of a blasted Baghdad infant-formula factory that CNN had toured in
August.;    "An official said it had been producing 20 tons of powdered milk a
day and was the only source of infant-formula food for children 1 year and
younger in Iraq," Arnett said in the broadcast cleared by Iraqi censors.;   
No one was injured in the raid, and Iraqis put the damage at $150 million,
Arnett said.;    When Arnett was asked later in the day by anchor Bob Cain
about the military contentions that the milk plant was a weapons facility,
Arnett's response was interrupted by static. When the connection resumed,
Arnett said he could say no more on the subject except that the plant "was
innocent enough from what we could see.";    Responding to the attacks on the
report, CNN Executive Vice President Ed Turner issued a statement late
Wednesday saying: "Arnett reported what the Iraqi claim was and his own
observations on site. He neither confirmed nor denied the Iraqi government's
statement. . . . CNN believes it is in the interest of our viewers to maintain
the only Western journalist to watch and report from Baghdad."  </TEXT>
