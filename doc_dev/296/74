   Television encountered the off-year elections
Tuesday night like a doctor ordering a full set of tests to take a
patient's temperature.
   ``It was the election of our discontent,'' CBS correspondent
Bruce Morton said in the early going, before the nation's dreaded
anti-incumbency mood stopped short of actually ousting any major
rascals.
   It had fewer commercials.
   And, for the first time, Cable News Network and the Big Three
broadcast networks pooled resources for election night exit polls
and winner projections, in a collaborative effort called Voter
Research and Surveys, or VRS.
   ``There are always problems the first time you do anything,''
said VRS spokeswoman Susan Morrison, adding that there were no big
problems with winner projections or the state exit polls.
   There was a delay in national exit polls, which tended to arrive
all at once, because VRS chief Warren Mitofsky wanted to ensure the
``weighting'' of 9,000 to 10,000 interviews accurately reflected
the national trends.
   ``It worked very well for us,'' said CNN spokeswoman Melinda
McIntire. By 9 p.m. EST, she said, VRS let the cable network
project 38 governor and Senate races. ``It's been extremely helpful
in our analyzing voters in geographic and demographic breakdowns.''
   By midnight, VRS had issued 72 projected winners in senate,
governor and referendum questions, Ms. Morrison said.
   ABC and NBC kept the first two hours of their prime time
entertainment, coverage, dropping in brief spot reports until
hourlong specials at 10 p.m. EST. CBS' coverage went the distance
from 9 p.m. to 11.
   But NBC's one-hour special and CBS' two hours were
``sustaining'' - read ``unsponsored'' - programs which don't count
in the November ratings ``sweeps'' that help local stations set
their advertising rates.
   The overall ratings race is tight this year, and typically low
election night ratings could pull down a network's overall numbers.
Top-rated NBC quickly followed suit after CBS said it would air no
commercials.
   CNN, which has no prime time entertainment programs, began its
coverage at 6 p.m. EST as ``The World Today'' neatly capsulized key
races. By 7 p.m., CNN's main coverage was in full swing.
   ABC and CBS led their nightly news shows with six-minute
election reports; their second story was the assassination of
radical Rabbi Meir Kahane. NBC led its news with nine minutes on
the election before getting to the Kahane story.
   CBS' election night anchor, Dan Rather, spent the night in
shirtsleeves, red tie and burgundy-striped suspenders. He also got
off the best quote, early ``We're going to be all over these races
like paint on a wall.''
   And the graphics!
   ABC and CBS colored their Democrats blue and the GOP red;
contrariwise, NBC made its Democrats red and the Republicans blue.
   ABC's ``The '90 Vote'' computer graphics screens had a
traditional look to them. Candidate pictures, numbers, percentages,
precincts reporting; and the network closed its main coverage with
a roll of the winners.
   NBC's ``Decision '90'' graphics were busy and postmodern: the
candidate pictures, superimposed on a split ppurple grid, beside
human silhouettes extending across a red or blue bar to the numeric
vote percentage.
   Then there were three diagonal red slashes pulsating across the
lower left corner while a narrow blue bar descended down the
screen.
   CNN listed the winners' names in gold, the losers in gray,
declaring projected winners with a chubby little check mark on a
bright red box.
   Unfortunately, CNN's party tags were donkey and elephant logos -
with blue backgrounds and red frames.
   CBS had outstanding line-score graphic rundowns of the winners,
picture, name, state, and a cute little logo of the state syumbol
(Hint: Maine was a lobster, Tennessee a coonskin cap
   CBS graphics outdid all others. Its snazzy, computer-driven,
green relief map of the United States giddily panned and tilted
from state to state at breakneck speed until some high-strung
producer probably told them to cut it out.
   CNN excelled with its team of four regional anchors who kept on
top of various races. In addition, CNN political reporter Brooks
Jackson covered the campaigns finances, coming up with some
surprising insights,
   CNN also gave the last eight minutes of each hour to the verbal
fisticuffs of ``The CNN Capital Gang,'' a four-member hodgepodge of
righty and lefty political pundits Michael Kinsley, Mark Shields,
Pat Buchanan and Robert Novak.
   After eight minutes, even the most casual viewer would want to
review U.S. policy against peacetime use of nuclear weapons.
   Shortly before 9 p.m. EST, the gang cut back to the venerable
CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, who looked bemused to the point of
snakebite. ``Don't you just love them?'' Shaw said without a
question mark in his voice.
