   Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw flew
west to anchor their Wednesday newscasts from quake-battered San
Francisco, while NBC officials explained NBC's slow initial
reportage of the quake.
   NBC News president Michael Gartner said the delay _ NBC was the
last to air pictures from the scene _ was because Tuesday's killer
earthquake had temporarily knocked NBC's San Francisco affiliate,
KRON-TV, off the air.
   That in turn delayed NBC's ability to immediately broadcast from
San Francisco, he said. In contrast, he added, the affiliated
stations of CBS and ABC still could function, thus competitively
helping their networks.
   Once it got rolling after 9 p.m. Tuesday, NBC offered non-stop
quake coverage _ including that on a five-hour ``Today'' show _
until noon Wednesday.
   Although CBS' coverage continued past midnight and ``Nightline''
aired a special update at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, ``we were the only
guy on all night long,'' Gartner said, referring only to the major
broadcast networks.
   Cable News Network, a 24-hour operation, also stayed on the
earthquake story throughout the night, relying in part on reports
from one of the Bay-area stations with which it has an affiliate
agreement, KTVU-TV in Oakland.
   Gartner described as ``bad luck'' NBC's initial delay in
reporting the earthquake.
   ``In a crisis, your first line of defense is that you go to your
affiliate'' where the crisis has happened, he said. ``And they
(KRON) were knocked out of the box.''
   ABC, in San Francisco to broadcast Game Three of the World
Series, actually was on the air with a pre-game sports report from
Candlestick Park when the quake hit at 8:04 p.m. EDT Tuesday.
   Four minutes later, Cable News Network aired the first bulletin
about the quake. CBS' bulletin by anchorman Dan Rather was at 8:21
p.m., followed two minutes later by a 60-second news report by Ted
Koppel, anchor of ABC's ``Nightline.''
   In contrast, NBC's first quake bulletin, read from Washington by
correspondent Katherine Couric, didn't air until 8:31 p.m. It
wasn't until after 9 p.m. that NBC joined its rivals in airing
pictures from the scene.
   It wasn't the happiest night for NBC anchor Tom Brokaw. Early in
his reports, when quake casualty figures were rising, he said 40
people had been reported killed in one freeway collapse and more
than 50 in another.
   The latter report proved erroneous. Brokaw subsquently corrected
himself on the air, an NBC spokeswoman said.
   In an action reminiscent of September 1985, when Brokaw, Rather
and ``World News Tonight'' anchor Peter Jennings of ABC anchored
their broadcasts from quake-stricken Mexico City, all three flew to
San Francisco to anchor their programs there.
   Each of the three men also anchored a one-hour prime-time
special on the San Francisco earthquake Wednesday.
   Rather also will anchor a ``48 Hours'' earthquake special
Thursday night. ABC's Sam Donaldson will also be in San Francisco
that night, co-anchoring his half of the ``PrimeTime Live'' news
series, ABC said.
   NBC's ``Today,'' starting a three-day visit in Chicago when the
quake hit, will broadcast from San Francisco on Thursday and Friday.
   With the second quake-caused postponement of Game Three of the
World Series announced Wednesday, ABC's schedule for that night
shifted from baseball to four sitcoms normally shown on Wednesday.
Jenning's earthquake special bumped a series on ABC, ``China
Beach.''
   ABC had no comment on how much it might lose in advertising
revenue because of postponements of the World Series.
   One Madison Avenue executive, Richard Kostrya, estimated that it
could total $10 million a night for each night the Series is
postponed. He said his figures represent the amount he estimates
regular programming earns.
   A postponed Series game, when finally broadcast, displaces a
night of regular programming and thus its advertising revenue,
explained Kostrya, an executive vice president at the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency.
   ABC, which he said got from $250,000 to $325,000 for each
30-second commercial to be shown during World Series telecasts,
won't lose that money, he said. The commercials will simply appear
when the next game does.
   ABC, he said, ``didn't lose the World Series money. That'll move
with the game.''
