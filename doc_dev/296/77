<TEXT>     So much has already happened while we were watching this prime time war
that the near-respite from action since the second attack on Israel has been a
relief. The war still made TV Saturday, of course, but so did the basketball
games, home-repair shows and escapades of the rich and famous that usually dot
the weekend agenda.;    And until a land war breaks out, that's probably the
way it's going to be on the tube: expanded network newscasts and hourly
updates and interruptions when warranted, even during today's NFL playoff
games. The wall-to-wall coverage is over for a while except on CNN.;    But as
night fell on America, it was hard not to wonder what was coming next. After
all, the previous three evenings had brought the start of war one night and
consecutive attacks on Israel the next two.;    They brought the remarkable
scene of three CNN reporters narrating American bombing from their hotel in
Baghdad. The next day, their line was cut off. It was returned to operation
briefly before anchor Bernie Shaw and reporter John Holliman left Iraq along
with other international reporters.;    Colleague Peter Arnett stayed on until
his line was cut for good by the Iraqis shortly after 1 a.m. PST Saturday.;   
NBC's Tom Aspell was also among the handful of foreign reporters left in the
Iraqi capital until they were expelled. He narrated new dramatic footage of
nighttime American raids, as well as shots of people in Baghdad bomb shelters.
That tape aired Saturday on the network.;    But save for the announcement at
an afternoon Pentagon briefing that the United States had sent not only
Patriot missiles to Israel, but American soldiers to operate them, there
wasn't a great deal of new war news Saturday.;     WHICH IS probably why the
video game-like black-and-white footage of a French Jaguar jet blasting an
ammunitions site 30 miles south of Kuwait City got such play.;    All the
networks used it and CNN even had retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Perry Smith
narrate over it with anchor Sharyl Attkisson, like John Madden and Pat
Summerall doing a football game.;    "Notice how low he is," Smith said of the
jet, "and notice how his system is tracking that thing. It is a missile, not a
bomb, and you'll see it come in on the left-hand side and there it hits.";   
Boom, as Madden would say, the rectangular warehouse exploded.;    But once
was not enough. We saw it again, and even a third time. Only it was garbled
and Smith couldn't tell what he was looking at -- and neither could we.;    "I
gotta tell you," he said, "the pilot's seeing a lot more than we're seeing in
this particular case.";    Attkisson apologized.;    "This tape just came to
us and we haven't had a chance to look at it that much," she said. "We haven't
had a chance to edit it. It looks a little messy here.";    It was and so was
the fact that the network of record in this war just tossed it on the air and
told its people to talk over it. There was no need for such urgency Saturday.;
   Eventually, we did see it in slow motion, though, as if we really needed
to. At the end, the screen went white with the explosion and Smith analyzed,
"We don't see much after that.";    We did see war protesters and war
supporters Saturday. And, along with network entertainment programming, we saw
the return of CNN's usually entertaining screaming match, "The Capital Gang."
When the Gang's guest, Al Haig, was done, each panelist closed with a thought
about the war.;     'A MISSOURI congressman named Mel Hancock asked this week,
'Whose side is the press on?' " related Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal.
"If he really wants to find a press that is lockstep with the war, he can go
to Baghdad.";    This week, he didn't have to. Baghdad came to him and the
rest of us via television. But next week, with the reporters gone from Iraq,
it may be a far different story.  </TEXT>
