   Preceded by ``here-come-de-judge'' jokes and
headlines about viewer juries, CNN's new ``The World Today''
premieres tonight, co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and former Texas
judge Catherine Crier.
   It will be a closely watched event. It's Crier's debut in news.
And it marks a direct CNN push, if only in half the nation, against
the ``CBS Evening News,'' ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and ``NBC
Nightly News.''
   Crier, 34, had no experience at all as a journalist when hired
by Cable News Network, whose action startled many in news. She only
has had two weeks on the job at CNN. Shaw, with CNN since it began
in 1979, is a 25-year veteran in news who came up the hard,
traditional way.
   Although he has declined to comment, he reportedly was more than
a little miffed at her hiring. Crier says she knows nothing of
that: ``That's not the message I've been receiving. And I've been
working with him.''
   She meant rehearsals of the new show. Crier, who will co-anchor
it at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, with Shaw co-anchoring in
Washington, is aware that a certain amount of criticism may follow
her on-air debut tonight.
   ``I'm not as worried about that initial round as I will be six
months or a year down the road'' if criticism continues, she says.
``Because I am brand new to the business, and I acknowledge that,
and have a lot to learn.''
   She doubtless will be the nation's most watched on-the-job
trainee. But CNN's new one-hour weeknight newscast, starting at 6
p.m. EDT, isn't likely to make a big dent in ratings of the Big
Three for several reasons.
   The major networks twice ``feed'' their half-hour weeknight
newscasts to affiliates, the first feed at 6:30 p.m. EDT. West
Coast affiliates air those newscasts three hours later on a
tape-delay basis.
   In contrast, ``The World Today'' will air live simultaneously in
all time zones, with no tape delays for the West Coast. Thus, its
head-on competition with the Big Three only will be in Eastern and
Central time zones.
   Its potential audience also is smaller because only it only is
on cable. CNN estimates it is seen in 52 million homes. That's
impressive, but there are a total of 92.1 million homes with TV,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures.
   Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president for newsgathering,
downplays the idea of the newcomer representing major competition
to the Big Three.
   ``In the cable world, I don't know that you say you're going to
make a dent in (Nielsen) numbers,'' he says. ``You hope to. But you
look for the kind of audience that's most desirable to sponsors _
some of the better-educated, more affluent viewers ... and we have
a pretty good market for that.''
   NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, referring to shares of audience for
programs, says that the new CNN rival is ``just one more
demonstration that every year, that pie out there is getting sliced
into that many more pieces.''
   But he says he's not certain whether ``The World Today'' is a
potential ratings threat to his newscast and those of CBS and ABC.
   He admires both CNN and Shaw _ ``I don't know anything about
that woman,'' he adds, referring to Crier. But ``my impression
always is that CNN's greatest strengths always have been as a kind
of random viewing place,'' he says.
   ``I don't know if people look for specific programs (there). I
guess that'' _ CNN's new newscast _ ``will be the test for them,
and for us, as well.''

   NBC, continuing its recent tradition of uplifting entertainment,
tonight airs another steamy tale of tawdry. It is ``Roxanne: The
Prize Pulitzer,'' which is set amid the rich in Palm Beach, Fla.,
and lasts for two hours.
   Based on the book of the same name by Roxanne Pulitzer, it
dramatizes her sad story, how her fairy-tale romance with and
marriage to publishing heir Herbert Pulitzer collapsed amid a
flurry of headlines about cocaine, trumpets, and sexual capers that
included one menage-a-trois.
   What to say of this movie? First, it is only her version of what
happened, the latter noted on the screen at the end, no doubt for
legal reasons. It is lushly filmed, and Roxanne mainly is depicted
as an innocent, vulnerable, misused waif.
   But Chynna Phillips is very, very good as poor, poor Roxanne.
One wishes she had a better script. One also wishes that Perry
King, given a one-dimensional part as the man who married the fair
young Roxanne, had hair color that stayed the same.
   Although only a passage of several years is involved here, his
locks are mostly silver in some scenes. In other scenes, the heir's
hair is mostly dark brown with a dab of gray.
   This drama may raise anew the debate over colorization, but it
is one that can be missed with no regrets.
