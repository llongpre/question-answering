<HEAD>Canadian Network Cutting 1,100 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said Dec. 5 it was
eliminating 1,100 jobs and cutting newscasts and other programming
to save $108 million.
   The shortfall is due to government funding cuts, inflation,
declining television advertising, and such other costs as new taxes
and pension funding, said CBC President Gerard Veilleux.
   The cuts represent just under 10 percent of CBC's $1.2 billion
annual budget. About $900 million of that comes from government and
the rest from ad revenue. CBC employs about 10,000 people, and the
layoffs are its worst ever.
   Veilleux said at a news conference that the cuts go into effect
April 1, but some effects will be felt immediately.
   ``These decisions have given me many sleepless nights,'' he told
CBC employees during a closed-circuit televised announcement. ``I
can only trust we're doing the right thing.''
   As part of the cuts, the CBC has decided it can no longer afford
the $20 million annual cost to run Radio Canada International, the
international shortwave radio service, or the $4.5-million cost of
the English and French parliamentary channels, which broadcast
House of Commons proceedings. CBC will ask the government to pick
up the tab for tese operations.
   In addition, English and French radio network budgets will be
cut by 1 percent. The following year, 2 percent will be trimmed
from their budgets.
   Newsworld, CBC's all-news cable channel, is not supposed to be
affected. However, many of its news items originate at regional
stations that will be closed.

<HEAD>Former Panamanian Diplomat Reportedly Focus of Tapes Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   The FBI investigation into who leaked tapes of
Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls focuses on a political opponent
who might testify against the deposed Panamanian dictator,
newspapers reported.
   The FBI believes the source of the leak appears to be Jose
Blandon, once an intelligence officer in Panama for Noriega and the
country's former consul general in New York, The Miami Herald and
The Washington Post reported, quoting unidentified sources.
   Blandon denied leaking the government tapes. In an interview
published Dec. 9 in The Post, Blandon said someone in the U.S.
government who wants to sabotage the Noriega trial must have been
responsible.
   ``Somebody in the government was leaking them,'' Blandon said.
Drug enforcement agents were present whenever he had access to the
tapes, and he was allowed to make only written notes, Blandon said.
   The FBI is trying to determine who gave the tapes to Cable News
Network, which aired some of Noriega's conversations from prison
over the past month. The broadcasts were halted briefly while a
federal judge decided whether Noriega's right to a fair trial would
be jeopardized. After reviewing the tapes, the judge decided to let
CNN broadcast them.
   In a related matter, the Justice Department is refusing to
return documents belonging to a CNN reporter, saying they may be
evidence in an investigation of the leaked recordings.
   The Justice Department filed a brief Dec. 3 with the U.S.
District Court in Atlanta opposing a motion by CNN for return of
the documents.
   The materials were in a box taken from a hotel room that
reporter Marlene Fernandez had been staying in. The FBI confiscated
the box after hotel officials, apparently thinking Fernandez had
checked out, reported it as abandoned property.
   The Justice Department said it kept 15 documents and returned
all the other items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and
five videotape cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   In another development, the network said Dec. 5 it was dropping
its fight to prevent the release of court transcripts of the
Noriega tapes.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, ruling in favor of four
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts, had
said they would be released unless CNN appealed.
   ``CNN's main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But after reviewing the transcripts, network officials decided
there was little danger of compromising those sources, he said.
   The organizations seeking the transcripts were The Miami Herald,
The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and
Gannett Co. Inc. and its USA Today. They argued that the public has
a right to examine the content of the tapes, which were at the
center of a freedom-of-the-press dispute.

<HEAD>Head of Japanese Public TV Wants Global News Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Japan's public broadcasting system said
he wants to create a global news network to counter the spread of
Cable News Network to dozens of countries.
   ``I don't mean to bad-mouth Mr. Turner, but CNN is trying to
force U.S. news on the rest of the world,'' NHK Chairman Keiji
Shima said Dec. 3, referring to CNN head Ted Turner.
   Uder Shima's plan, broadcasters from Asia, Europe and North
America would be responsible for eight-hour daily segments focusing
on their own region.
   Shima said he believed Asians should cover issues about Asia,
but he did not give a detailed explanation why. He also said there
was not enough news about the region being broadcast to other parts
of the globe.
   Shima, in a speech to foreign reporters, acknowledged that the
British Broadcasting Corp. has shown little interest in his
proposal. But he said other major broadcasters have expressed
interest.
   He did not identify those broadcasters, however, and an NHK
spokeswoman said the names could not be released because
negotiations were under way.
   Shima provided no concrete details of his plan, but said he
hoped such a network could be set up in about six months.
   NHK has two channels on Japanese television, one with general
programming and the other featuring educational fare. It also has
two stations for satellite broadcasting. The programming on those
stations includes news broadcasts from several countries.
