   In 1984, there was great hand-wringing over the
networks' decision to drop gavel-to-gavel coverage of the national
conventions in favor of roughly two hours of live prime-time
coverage a night.
   In 1988, the question that's starting to be asked is whether two
hours of prime-time coverage a night is too much.
   Former NBC News President Reuven Frank, who has attended seven
conventions as a network producer, saw the end of gavel-to-gavel
coverage and expects this year to watch the last prime-time
coverage.
   ``Conventions are now being held by the two major parties only
because there's television,'' Frank said. ``That's the only
justification for the convention at all. There is no journalistic
reason for our being there. I think we ought to be there; I don't
think we ought to carry it live.
   ``There's nothing going to happen that you don't know now
sitting here. But we don't know how to stop. It's like `The Old Man
and the Sea.'''
   Next week, when the Democrats meet in Atlanta, they are certain
to nominate Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. The only major
questions remaining are who his running mate will be and what Jesse
Jackson, the runner-up, will do or say.
   Media-wise political parties know that prime-time bickering
turns off voters, so conventions have become little more than
prime-time commercials. A one-time major network event, the
conventions are becoming a made-for-cable show.
   Complete coverage will be available on C-SPAN and the Cable News
Network, a trend that will no doubt allow the three major networks
to say by 1992 that cable TV provides sufficient coverage to meet
the public need and the networks no longer need devote live prime
time to the proceedings. Indeed, they are already beginning to say
that.
   ``Our responsibility as a news organization has changed
somewhat,'' said NBC producer Anne Binford. ``In the past, we felt
we had to provide coverage of the entire convention, but now, with
cable and C-SPAN and CNN, the viewers can watch the coverage from
many different sources. We're now trying to bring the audience a
condensed version of the important events of the night.''
   All three networks say their coverage plans are flexible,
depending on events. But the intention is to go on the air from
9-11 p.m. EDT each of the four nights. CBS plans to start at 8 p.m.
on Thursday.
   C-SPAN will carry each session of the convention live, in its
entirety, without commentary or interviews.
   CNN plans to carry convention updates throughout the day, the
convention session in its entirety, followed by a half-hour wrapup,
then ``Crossfire'' and ``Inside Politics '88.'' The most devout
political junkies can even catch convention highlights from 4-6 a.m.
   Jeff Gralnick, ABC's executive producer of special broadcasts,
wishes the networks could justify such extensive coverage.
   ``I think there's a hell of a vibrant political story at the
conventions,'' he said. ``I'm a political junkie, and I just find
what the Democrats are doing and later the Republicans a
fascinating political dynamic.''
   But he concedes the conventions ``are not a mass-audience
program.''
   ``For the sake of the union, I wish they were, but if you look
at the number of people who choose to vote out of the universe of
people who can vote, you begin to get an answer of why people don't
watch political conventions. If they don't care to vote, they
certainly aren't going to watch the end product of the voting.''
   CNN stands to become the star of the Democrats' convention. It
has anchor power in Mary Alice Williams and Bernard Shaw, and with
the networks paring down their staffs for budgetary considerations,
the cable network is in their league. CNN will have 275 staffers
compared to the 300-350 each for the bigger networks. In addition,
CNN is based in Atlanta and has a home-field advantage.
   The three networks are taking 25-50 percent fewer staffers to
this year's conventions than they did in 1984.
   ``I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a matter of budget, but more
it's a matter of each time you do one of these things, you learn
how to do them a little more efficiently,'' said Gralnick.
   ``It's new times,'' said Binford. ``I think with the new
technology, we're able to cover it just as efficiently.''
   Frank, himself an innovator of much of the present-day
convention coverage, such as anchor booths overlooking the
convention floor, agrees that the networks have learned a lot.
   But, he adds, ``now that we know how to cover it, there's
nothing to cover.''
