<LEADPARA>  To amplify Rolling Stone magazine's fabled advertising campaign, perception is
often far more important than reality when it comes to selling ads. The latest
beneficiary of this marketing wisdom could be the Cable News Network, whose
dramatic coverage of the Persian Gulf war has been touted by everyone from Tom
Brokaw to Tariq Aziz.;    But CNN has two strikes against it: the cable
network is part of a medium still dominated by broadcasting, and its average
daily ratings are still very low in a business enamored of numbers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So even as they basked in the glow of the world's praise last week, CNN's
sales executives faced a troubling question: Will the enhanced prestige of the
24-hour-a-day television news service translate into new advertising revenue?;
   The answer is far from clear.;    CNN not only drew critical acclaim for
its Middle East coverage, it drew viewers. It had its highest Nielsen numbers
ever on Wednesday, the night Baghdad was bombed, drawing 10.8 million homes
between 8 and 11 p.m., 13 times CNN's average audience for its 10 p.m. daily
newscast.;    During the same period on Wednesday, CBS, the lowest-rated
broadcast network, attracted 12.4 million households.;    Still, advertising
agency executives do not presume that CNN's high ratings will last.;   
William Miller, the director of network operations at the Bozell advertising
agency in New York, recalled that CNN's ratings ballooned during its coverage
of the Chinese crackdown at Tiananmen Square, the crumbling of the Berlin Wall
and the San Francisco Bay area earthquake, but they settled down shortly
afterward, and few new advertisers were attracted.;    "The Persian Gulf has
been incredible for them, and they deserve praise for their coverage, but
whether or not it will have anything to do with increased billings, I couldn't
say," said Miller, who already places ads for Chrysler and Merrill Lynch,
among other clients, on CNN.;    CNN's advertising growth has been hindered by
several factors in addition to low ratings. Because it telecasts news, broken
up by only a few distinct programs like "Larry King Live," advertisers have
been worried that their commercials would reach the same viewers -- who tune
in for repeated news updates -- over and over again, said Joseph Ostrow, the
corporate media director at Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications.;    In
addition, advertisers have typically bought cable time purely for reasons of
efficiency, and not for the quality of a cable network's programming or
audience, said Gene DeWitt, the president of DeWitt Media, a media-buying
service in New York.;    "Cable companies rarely come in and say, 'We're good,
so you should buy us,' " he said. "Instead, they come in and say, 'We're
cheap, so you should buy us.' CNN has been tarred by that brush.";    But even
if Nielsen cannot quantify prestige, many advertising executives including
Ostrow and DeWitt believe that CNN's performance during the last several days
will inevitably change advertisers' minds.;    The reasons, said Ostrow, whose
agency places ads for Mazda automobiles and many other clients on CNN, can be
boiled down to three bits of media jargon: sampling, distribution and
environment.;    DeWitt even speculated that CNN might be able to raise its ad
rates by as much as 30 percent on the basis of the higher awareness and
positive image of the cable network.;    Take sampling. Many people looked at
CNN for the first time last week. Presumably, some of them will return on a
regular basis.;    Abbott L. Wool, the corporate media director of Vitt Media
International, a large media-buying service, said this assumption was bound to
influence his and other buyers' projections of CNN's future ratings, rendering
the network more marketable, at least in the short term.;    Even more
important, he said, is that sampling will increase viewers' familiarity with
CNN's on-air personalities, a critical factor in attracting advertising.;   
"People don't talk about watching CBS or ABC, but Rather and Jennings," Wool
said. "Now they'll talk about Bernie Shaw and others. That will translate into
permanent viewers and ratings and add to the value of those personalities.";  
 CNN's new image will also aid its quest for new outlets. There are 93.1
million American homes with television sets; CNN reaches only the 56.8 million
homes with cable television. But CNN has a substantial and growing audience in
hotels overseas, which multinational marketers are beginning to find
desirable.;    "That's an influential audience and you can't belittle it,"
said Marcella Rosen, the media director of the Ayer advertising agency. "If
they're looking for new distribution, their recent coverage certainly helps.";
   CNN's least tangible but most significant boost may be "environmental," a
word advertisers use when discussing the words and images that surround their
spots.;    Even though CNN's average evening ratings will likely remain far
below those of broadcast network newscasts when the Persian Gulf dust storms
settle, the likelihood that more people will now mention CNN in the same
breath as NBC, CBS and ABC may spur some advertisers to try cable news.;    If
that happens, the networks -- already jealous of the attention being paid CNN
-- may have some business headaches as well, Wool of Vitt Media said.;   
"When a client says, 'I want a news environment,' CNN is now a much stronger
competitor relative to network news," he said.  </TEXT>
