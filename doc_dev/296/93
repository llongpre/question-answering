   Anchorman Dan Rather and other CBS employees
left Iraq on Tuesday under the orders of Iraqi authorities, a
spokeswoman said.
   ``All of the CBS newspeople were politely asked to be out
today,'' said CBS News spokeswoman Donna Dees.
   ``We were staying as long as we could stay and not put anybody's
life in danger,'' she said. ``Clearly, we reached almost that point
where we might not have gotten out.''
   Reporters for The Associated Press and other newsgathering
organizations continue to work in Iraq, which invaded Kuwait nearly
three weeks ago.
   The CBS contingent flew to Amman, Jordan, where Rather will
continue to cover the story along with correspondents Allen Pizzey
and Peter Van Sant.
   Ms. Dees said she could not say how many CBS staffers are in
Jordan. A CBS source, however, said the network is keeping about 30
people in Jordan.
   The CBS contingent got to Baghdad on Wednesday, 12 hours after
an ABC crew led by ``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel. Koppel left
Baghdad on Thursday, followed several days later by his ABC
colleagues.
   ``We have been advancing the story of the Americans left there
(in Iraq),'' Ms. Dees said. ``It's been our story all weekend.''
   CBS correspondents in the region include Bob Simon in Saudi
Arabia; Bill McLaughlin in Cairo, Doug Tunnel in Dubai, and Martha
Teischner in Tel Aviv.
   NBC's ``Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw on Tuesday returned to
New York City from Saudi Arabia, where he had been anchoring the
network's coverage of the invasion.
   ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel remains in Saudi Arabia, as does
correspondent Arthur Kent. In Amman, NBC's on-air reporting is by
correspondents Garrick Utley, Dennis Murphy and Keith Miller.
   Other NBC correspondents include Tom Aspell in Dubai, Rick Davis
and Mike Boettcher in Cairo, Tom Pettit in Iran, and Ike Seamans in
Tel Aviv.
   ``Overall, we have about 70 people involved in this coverage,
and that doesn't include translators, drivers and other support
staff,'' said NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay.
   ABC's coverage of the Mideast crisis is still being anchored
here by ``World News Tonight'' anchor Peter Jennings, who had been
the network's Beirut bureau chief and has anchored all special
report coverage.
   Correspondents on the story include Sam Donaldson and Mike Von
Fremd in Saudi Arabia; Jim Hickey in Cairo, Mike Lee in Dubai,
United Arab Emirates; Peter Collins in Ankara, Turkey.
   ABC has three correspondents in Amman: Forrest Sawyer, John
McKenzie and John Donvan. ABC spokesman Scott Richardson had no
exact figures on the number of people covering the story.
   The Cable News Network kept its anchor, Bernard Shaw, in
Washington. ``He's doing what he's supposed to be doing,'' said
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy.
   CNN on Tuesday had three correspondents in Amman: Rich Roth, Jim
Clancy and Robert Weiner; Christiane Amanpour and John Sweeney
covered the story from Saudi Arabia, where CNN's Carl Rochelle was
a Pentagon pool reporter.
   CNN's Jonathan Mann was shuttling between Tripoli and Cairo, and
Doug James was in Dubai. CNN also has between 45 and 50 editorial
and technical staffers on duty in the Middle East.
