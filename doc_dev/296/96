<LEADPARA>  IF YOU think you have budget troubles, you ought to try balancing the books
for the network news departments in the wake of the war.;    If NBC's war
costs -- almost $45 million in expenses and lost ad revenues, the network says
-- are similar to those of ABC and CBS, it means the trio has spent about $135
million covering the war.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We don't know for sure, because only NBC is saying how much the coverage
cost it, but it's unlikely that the numbers are very different for the other
guys.;    The bad news is that it probably means more cuts in departments that
have already been ravaged by the bean-counters in recent years.;    If there's
one thing the war demonstrated vividly, it is that network newscasts and
network news coverage are a long way from the extinction that has been
predicted for years.;    Local stations cannot cover momentous international
events like the war. They don't have the expertise or the bodies to do so.;   
The networks do, but if the bottom-line boys continue to be the ultimate
decision-makers, it's going to be a lot tougher to cover something like the
gulf war in the future.;    CNN back to normal;    Meanwhile, CNN, which says
its costs for the war will run in the $12 million to $15 million range, has
moved back to a peace footing, restoring its regular schedule and shows like
"Show Biz Today," which disappeared during the fighting.;    Along with the
new sked, the cable network has a raft of new anchor pairings, the
commutations and permutations of which are too numerous to go into here.;   
But the big news is that as of Monday, Baghdad bomb-witness Bernard Shaw has a
new co-anchor. She is Susan Rook and she'll share "Primenews" at 5 our time
and "CNN Evening News" at 7 with Shaw, with him in Washington and her in
Atlanta.;    Prior to the war, he had been paired with former judge Catherine
Crier, who will now handle "The International Hour" at noon and "The World
Today" at 3 p.m. with Frank Sesno, who leaves the White House to come into the
studio.;    The Shaw-Crier team had gotten attention when it began a year and
a half ago because she came straight from the bench and he didn't like being
paired with an inexperienced anchor.;    It's not known if his complaints had
anything to do with her move, but you can bet his feelings now carry more
weight with the people who decide such things than they did before Jan. 16.;  
 And for those keeping a CNN scorecard at home, Sesno will be replaced as the
No. 2 reporter at the White House (behind Charles Bierbauer) by Mary
Tillotson, whose Capitol Hill job will be taken by Candy Crowley.;    As
usual, there will be a test on all this later.;    Love walks in;    "Anything
But Love" may have to change its name to the full title of the song from
whence it came -- "I Can't Give You Anything But Love.";    That's because
Hannah and Marty finally get around to making whoopee on Wednesday's show,
although not while we're watching. All we see is the aftermath and it's pretty
funny, especially when the pair imagine how the folks at the office will take
their liaison and act out scenes from Noel Coward, "Front Page," "Twin Peaks"
and "Streetcar Named Desire.";    The latter is especially good, with Richard
Lewis playing Brando and yelling "Hannah!" at the top of his lungs instead of
"Stella!";    Whether we see all that as scheduled, however, at 9:30 Wednesday
(Chs. 7, 11, 13) may depend on the length of President Bush's address to a
joint session of Congress .;    Turning the clock on kids;    If your kids
have been getting up on Saturday mornings to watch "Captain N and the
Adventures of the Super Mario 3" on KRON (Ch. 4), they're going to have to set
that alarm an hour earlier from now on.;    But that's nothing compared to
what teen-age fans of "Saved by the Bell" will have to do. Instead of tuning
in at 8, they're going to have to get up at 3:30, stay up until then or set
the VCR because that's where KRON has buried the show to make room for a new
three-hour Saturday news block.;    The station began running morning
newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays during the war and said Monday it will make
them permanent.;    On Saturdays, Mark Mullen and Renee Kemp will anchor from
8 to 9 a.m. with that newscast being repeated from 9 to 10. At 10, Mullen and
Kemp will be back for an hour of news before "Home Turf.";    On Sundays, the
pair will read the news from 8 to 8:30.;    All of which means that a good
chunk of the station's Saturday morning NBC lineup for kids will now become a
Saturday-before-dawn lineup for kids, beginning with "Saved by the Bell.";   
"Chipmunks Go to the Movies" will follow at 4; "Camp Candy" moves back an hour
to 4:30; "Rick Moranis in Gravedale High" stays at 5; "Captain Planet" shifts
from 6 to 5:30; "Buster and Me" moves to 7, and every child's favorite, "The
Wall Street Journal Report," goes to 7:30.;    "The Guys Next Door," NBC's
cheesy attempt to copy the New Kids on the Block, will mercifully disappear in
the shuffle.  </TEXT>
