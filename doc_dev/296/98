   Viewers who grumble that the only news on TV is
bad news soon will be able to choose some of the stories they want
to see on Cable News Network.
   CNN announced Thursday the first experiment in ``interactive
news'' by a national network _ a program similar to ones by smaller
stations where viewers vote on whether to see ``Godzilla'' or
``Planet of the Apes'' as the late-night movie.
   The experiment begins July 23 on CNN's ``Newsnight,'' an
hour-long newscast at midnight. The choices will involve secondary
news or features.
   Viewers will see a summary of headlines at the beginning of the
show and, as anchors read the day's top news, dial a 900 telephone
number to vote on which of the stories they'd like to see. The
stories that get the most votes, which cost 95 cents per call, will
be shown.
   CNN officials emphasize that viewers won't be dictating news
value but will tell the network what areas, outside of breaking
news, most interest them.
   ``We're not going to let viewers decide the editorial policy of
CNN,'' said spokesman John Bianchi. ``A lot of stuff does not make
it on the air that we do in fact cover. This is a way to get more
of the stuff on the air that we might not have made the decision on
initially.''
   Bianchi said CNN, which had trouble filling all its newscasts
when it was started by media mogul Ted Turner in 1980, just doesn't
have enough time now to air all the stories it would like to. So
viewers _ in 54 million U.S. households and 90 countries _ are
being asked to let producers know their preferences.
   ``We can tell by the volume and quality of viewer phone calls
and letters we receive each day that CNN has very informed
viewers,'' said CNN Senior Executive Bob Furnad. ``This new
interactive segment will allow those viewers to tell us in a
relatively direct fashion the kinds of information they most want.''
   At least one of CNN's network competitors reacted with surprise
to the announcement. Asked if the concept would spread to the Big
Three networks, CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said, ``It doesn't sound
like something we'd get involved in.''
   The public relations departments at NBC and ABC offered no
immediate response.
   Interactive television, a concept of two-way communication
between viewers and programmers with TV remote controls, emerged in
the early 1980s.
   CNN's concept ``is not exactly the promise of interactivity
where you can really customize your TV viewing on what you want to
see,'' said media analyst Betsy Frank with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New
York. ``But using 900-line technology to a certain degree and
having people feel they have a decision-making posture in what gets
aired _ it's an interesting idea.''
   Ms. Frank said the phone-in concept is not new _ networks like
Fox have used it for viewers to vote on movie lineups.
   ``The trend of the last decade is viewers assuming more control
and taking it away from the three networks,'' she said, adding that
CNN could raise its ratings with the experiment. ``The more
involved the viewer, the more likely he is to hang around.''
   Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc. developed the first
interactive technology, called ``Qube,'' in Ohio in 1981. In one
experiment, cable subscribers electronically registered their
reactions to a speech by then-President Carter by responding to
questions on remote, book-sized consoles hooked to their
televisions.
   ACTV Domestic Corp. then developed technology, tested in a
eight-week experiment on Continental Cablevision in Massachusetts,
in which viewers of a golf tournament chose which player they
wanted to see. The camera followed that player through the course.
