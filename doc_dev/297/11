U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, in Miami, ruled that transcripts of 
prison-taped conversations between Manuel A. Noriega and his lawyers, which led 
to a showdown in court between the defense attorneys and Cable News Network, 
are public property.

<P>
Hoeveler's decision answered other news organizations' demands for access to 
the transcripts. The Miami Herald, Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station 
WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today had claimed that the public 
has a right to the facts behind a case that tested 1st Amendment protection 
against restraint of the press. CNN lawyer Terry Bienstock said the network had 
not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.
