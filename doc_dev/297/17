   A federal appeals court on Saturday upheld an
injunction barring Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also called on the
Atlanta-based network to produce the seven tapes in U.S. District
Court in Miami so the court could decide whether the broadcasts
would endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   The ruling came after CNN on Friday defied Judge William
Hoeveler in Miami, broadcasting excerpts from the tapes minutes
after the judge issued an order instructing the network not to do
so.
   CNN said it would appeal Saturday's ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``We will be pursuing an immediate appeal,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said in a telephone interview. Haworth said he didn't know
yet if CNN would continue televising excerpts of the tapes.
   The appeals panel denied CNN's appeal of Hoeveler's 10-day
injunction against broadcasting excerpts of Noreiga's phone calls
from federal jail.
   It called on the network to produce the tapes in Hoeveler's
courtroom so that the trial judge can determine if Noriega's Sixth
Amendment rights to a fair trial have been violated by the U.S.
government and CNN.
   ``The First Amendment interests of the press and public will
best be served by immediate production of the tapes held by CNN so
that the district court can conduct the difficult balancing of
constititional rights,'' the appeals court said.
   ``CNN has shackled the district court by refusing that court's
reasonable request to review the audiotapes it has in its
possession,'' the court said.
   The Justice Department on Saturday morning filed a brief with
the appeals court, claiming the tapes could make it difficult to
select an unbiased jury for Noriega's trial.
   Noriega's right to a fair trial and effective counsel also could
be compromised if details of the defense strategy are revealed to
prosecutors, the brief said.
   ``The government cannot at this point be more specific with
respect to the possible harm that could flow from publication of
the tapes because the government, like the district court, does not
know the contents of the materials CNN has in its possession,'' the
brief states.
   On Friday, Hoeveler said he would hold CNN in contempt of court
if it disregarded his order. But in an unusual interview with CNN
outside the courtroom Friday night, the judge said he could not
rule on contempt without a prosecutors' motion.
   On Saturday afternoon, Noriega attorney Frank Rubino asked
Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and fine the network
$300,000 for each time it had televised the tapes and each time it
shows them in future.
   Before Hoeveler could respond, CNN attorney Terry Beinstock
asked the judge to disqualify himself, accusing the judge of
revealing a personal bias against the network in the CNN interview
on Friday night.
   In the interview, a CNN reporter asked Hoeveler if he planned to
find CNN in contempt.
   ``That remains to be seen,'' the judge said. Asked why, the
judge replied, ``Well, somebody's going to have to move for that
and they (CNN) obviously are in contempt at the moment. The legal
proceedings will take place when somebody moves for sanctions.''
   In Miami, federal district Chief Judge James Lawrence King said
Saturday the motion seeking to disqualify Hoeveler from
consideration of the contempt issue ``will be handled in the
orderly manner prescribed for such situations.'' He would not
comment further.
   A tape CNN played Friday contained a brief conversation in
Spanish between Noriega and Rubino's secretary, said to be acting
as a translator for the English-speaking defense team.
   CNN provided an on-screen English translation and narration in
English that made it impossible to hear the actual exchange.
   CNN said the secretary told Noriega two people have been
arrested in Panama and says he should determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   Noriega says he knows only one of the people.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,'' CNN
translated Noriega as saying. ``It says they are trying to induce
any of the two of them to testify before the court against me.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were Felipe Camargo,
a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in Panama who had been the
general's top liaison with the Cubans, and Alfredo Sanchez, whom
The Miami Herald identified Saturday as a convicted drug smuggler
once employed by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.
   Other tapes played Friday included conversations between Noriega
and his supporters, including a discussion with his mistress'
mother about the transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel in exchange for letting drugs
move safely through Panama to the United States.
   He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside
Miami since shortly after surrendering to U.S. soldiers who invaded
his country in December.
