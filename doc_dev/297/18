<HEAD>Justice Department Opposes Return of Some CNN Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Justice Department argues that documents
Cable News Network wants returned may become evidence in the
investigation of the leak of Manuel Noriega's taped prison
telephone calls.
   The court filing by the department on Monday did not say how the
15 documents might be such evidence.
   The documents include a list of telephone numbers apparently
compiled by CNN reporter Marlene Fernandez, the Justice Department
said.
   CNN's Nov. 8 broadcast about Noriega's conversations with his
attorneys and others from a federal prison near Miami triggered a
legal dispute over the network's right to air the tapes.
   The Supreme Court last month upheld a federal judge's temporary
order barring CNN from airing any tapes of conversations between
the deposed Panamanian dictator and his lawyers pending a court
review of the material.
   Last week, the temporary ban was lifted by William M. Hoeveler,
the judge who is presiding over Noriega's drug conspiracy case in
Miami.
   CNN, which played a segment of one conversation in defiance of
Hoeveler's order, has so far not aired any other conversations.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is conducting a criminal
investigation into the theft of the tapes, which defense lawyers
say compromised Noriega's ability to get a fair trial.
   In its filing Monday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, the
Justice Department opposed a motion by CNN for the return of the 15
documents that FBI agents kept following a search of a box
containing material used by Ms. Fernandez in preparing her
broadcasts.
   The box was found abandoned Nov. 12 in a room at the Omni Hotel
and turned over to the hotel's lost and found department.
   The Justice Department noted that it had returned all the other
items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and five videotape
cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   Copies of the 15 documents the FBI agents kept have also been
furnished to CNN lawyers, the Justice Department said.
   ``All of these 15 documents relate to the FBI's investigation
into the theft of government property,'' the department said in its
brief.
   FBI agent Jeffrey B. Lang said in an affidavit attached to the
pleadings that ``it is entirely likely that in any subsequent
prosecution, the items may well be introduced into evidence.''
   Besides a piece of paper marked ``telephone numbers,'' the
seized material includes a ``Noriega Tapes'' script, several sets
of Noriega transcripts and descriptions of recordings.
