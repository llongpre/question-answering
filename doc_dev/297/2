   A federal judge today weighed whether the
transcripts of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls are the
property of CNN or are part of the public record and should be
shared with other news organizations.
   Four news organizations went before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler on Thursday seeking the court transcripts. Cable News
Network fought to keep them secret, accusing other media of trying
to scoop the network with its own story.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Monday.
   Robert Bernius, representing Gannett Co. and its USA Today,
argued that in the wake of Hoeveler's decision on Wednesday to lift
his 3-week-old ban on airing the tapes, the transcripts were of
vital public importance.
   ``We ... want to know why a First Amendment crisis was
precipitated by these tapes,'' Bernius said.
   Gannett and USA Today joined The Miami Herald, The Associated
Press and the Miami-area Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV in the
effort to obtain the transcripts.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the transcripts should be
burned or returned to the network.
   ``This is not a clash of First Amendment rights, it is merely a
display of competitive jealousy,'' CNN said in court papers.
   Bienstock argued that giving them to other media organizations
would be like CNN demanding that the organizations give the network
their own reporters' notes. The transcripts include some tapes that
CNN has never broadcast, he said.
   ``This is again an intrusion into the news-gathering,
news-editing process,'' said Bienstock.
   Sanford Bohrer, another attorney for the four media
organizations, said, ``I think it's unfortunate that CNN feels it's
being put upon by others in the media. The real issue is the
public's right to look at anything it can get its hands on.''
   He noted that the transcripts were made by the court and the
originll tapes were made by the Bureau of Prisons, not CNN.
   Hoeveler interrupted Bienstock frequently and chided CNN for
fighting previously to broadcast the tapes, then opposing release
of the transcripts.
   ``The whole thrust of your case was that you wanted the world to
know what was on the tapes,'' Hoeveler said.
   Bienstock also cited a reporter's right to protect a
confidential source, saying scrutiny of the transcripts could help
reveal who gave the tapes to CNN.
   But the judge noted that the government, through the U.S.
attorney's office, had already seen the transcripts.
   ``In any event,'' he added, I have very little sympathy with
your source. Someone down the line has committed some grave
improprieties.''
   Bernius said those seeking the tapes had no interest in
identifying CNN's source, only in getting ``access to the factual
basis of a landmark judicial determination.''
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   Noriega's attorneys went into court Nov. 8 after learning about
the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to play any that might
interfere with attorney-client privilege. The network aired some
portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew them when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   The transcripts then were prepared by court officials in Miami
to aid Hoeveler and attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents
of the tapes.
   On Wednesday, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the
tapes and returned them to the network. CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
has said the network had no immediate plans to play the unaired
tapes in the next few days.
   While CNN won't say where it got the tapes, Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
   One tape broadcast was a conversation between Noriega and his
defense team in which he speculated about whether two Panamanians
captured after the U.S. invasion would testify against him. On
another tape, Noriega appeared to be attempting to transfer $4
million with the help of his mistress' mother.
