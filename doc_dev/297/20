   The case of the Manuel Noriega tapes casts a shadow
over freedom of the press even though a federal judge lifted his
order blocking their broadcast, a constitutional scholar says.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler brought one legal battle
between Noriega and Cable News Network to a close Wednesday when he
lifted his 3-week-old order barring CNN from airing tapes of the
former dictator's jailhouse phone calls.
   Rodney Smolla, head of the Institute of Bill of Rights Law at
William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said he was
disturbed that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene earlier
to throw out the judge's order and that the high court will not get
another chance to review the order.
   ``It died with a whimper and I think it's unfortunate the case
ended this way,'' he said. ``It left on the books precedents that
cast some doubt on First Amendment protections that many people
thought were well settled.''
   Noriega's attorneys said they will still ask for contempt
penalties against CNN for broadcasting excerpts the day after
Hoeveler's ban.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino also has requested that all
charges against Noriega be dropped on grounds the taping, a dispute
over Noriega's legal fees and other alleged government misconduct
ruined his chances of a fair trial.
   A decision on that request awaits, among other things, the
outcome of an FBI investigation into how the tapes were leaked.
   The judge lifted his order after he and attorneys reviewed
transcripts of seven tapes the network submitted last week.
   During Wednesday's hearing, Rubino withdrew his request to stop
the broadcasts, saying the only tape that appeared to violate
attorney-client privilege already had been broadcast. ``It does no
good to close the barn door after the horse is out,'' he said.
   Prosecutors also said they had no objection to lifting the ban,
again insisting Noriega's rights were never violated by the taping.
   Later Wednesday, CNN broadcast portions of the previously aired
tape. Spokesman Steve Haworth said the network had no immediate
plans to air the others.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the judge's decision would allow
the network to pursue its story on the government's taping of
Noriega's conversations.
   ``CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this
judicial prior restraint on press freedom,'' he said.
   Scholars said the possible precedents from the case include
allowing prior restraint of news reporting, something most believed
to be strictly prohibited by the First Amendment.
   ``The fact that the Supreme Court has tolerated this gag order
for this length of time will unfortunately send a sign to judges
and lawyers around the country that a little prior restraint is
OK,'' said Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press.
   Rubino said the Drug Enforcement Administration or State
Department leaked the tapes to the government of Panama, which in
turn gave them to CNN. He said he wants the source of the leak
identified.
   ``We had to go along the road and put out fires - now we're
going after the pyromaniacs that started the fires,'' Rubino said.
   To head off more leaks, Hoeveler also ruled that the Bureau of
Prisons, which routinely records inmate conversations for security
reasons, cannot share any of Noriega's tapes with other agencies
without the judge's permission.
   The tape that touched off the dispute was of a conversation
between Noriega and one of Rubino's investigators, with the
lawyer's Spanish-speaking secretary serving as an interpreter. In
the conversation, Noriega is asked about two recently arrested
Panamanians and speculates that prosecutors intend to use them as
witnesses against him.
   Rubino on Nov. 8 got Hoeveler to order CNN to halt broadcasting
of any tapes that might interfere with attorney-client privilege.
The network aired a tape for a day but stopped when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court then refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote,
forcing CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   Noriega is in a federal jail outside Miami awaiting on charges
of taking $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
