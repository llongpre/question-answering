   A federal judge broadened the constitutional issues
in the CNN-Manuel Noriega tapes case Monday, saying basic fairness
could allow him to block broadcast of the defendant's prison phone
conversations.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler cited fairness again in
warning prosecutors to either persuade foreign governments to free
$20 million in frozen Noriega-linked bank accounts to pay defense
lawyers, or appear before him for a hearing aimed at proving the
money was drug-tainted.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to
be acquiring - that the defendant is not going to be able to get a
fair trial,'' Hoeveler said. ``There's an obvious need by all of us
in a case like this to show that our system, in fact, does work
from top to bottom.''
   On the tapes issue, the judge said transcripts of tapes handed
over by Cable News Network last week were expected to be completed
by late Monday, and will be discussed by all sides in a closed
hearing Wednesday morning.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Thursday on whether to maintain
his order preventing the network from broadcasting the tapes made
of calls the former Panamanian leader made from his prison cell
outside Miami.
   The judge emphasized he would review all CNN's tapes, not just
those between Noriega and his lawyers. He said an 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals opinion upholding his original gag order allowed
him to consider ``broader questions'' than attorney-client
privilege.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock protested, saying the issue should
not include matters such as pretrial publicity because the defense
had not asked for such a ruling.
   Outside the court, he said he was alarmed by the judge's
comments.
   ``It's bad enough that the court's engaging in this process of
pre-publication review,'' he said. ``But it's more disturbing that
the court is going broader than even the litigants are seeking.''
   Noriega's lawyers were pleased with the handling of the tapes,
however.
   ``How the devil can he ever receive a fair trial ... if CNN's
going to play his innermost, private discussions with his lawyers
planning his defense strategy,'' said Frank Rubino, Noriega's lead
attorney.
   In the second part of Monday's hearing, the judge said he would
postpone appointment of government-paid lawyers to replace Rubino's
defense team to give the government another chance to unfreeze
Noriega's foreign bank accounts.
   Prosecutors agreed in June to free the money, but later said
foreign governments had stepped in by filing their own confiscation
orders against the 27 accounts.
   Hoeveler said he would order a hearing on the frozen accounts
within 10 days to determine if the money was illegally earned.
   Noriega is facing up to 145 years in prison on a February 1988
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to protect and facilitate their
U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside Miami.
