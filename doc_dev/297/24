   The FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes
and was checking whether they are related to the Manuel Noriega
recordings at the center of a court battle. The network protested
the tapes were obtained without a warrant.
   Cable News Network said the tapes were in a box of materials
related to the Noriega case that was removed from a hotel room that
had been occupied by one of its reporters. The room was in the Omni
Hotel, which is part of a complex that houses CNN's offices.
   It was not immediately clear whether the tapes taken were audio
recordings or videotapes. CNN President Tom Johnson and CNN chief
counsel Steve Korn said they didn't know the contents of the box.
FBI spokesman Scott Nelson confirmed that authorities obtained CNN
tapes without a subpoena, but he didn't know what kind of tapes
they were.
   ``We were made aware of the tapes and merely picked them up for
analysis,'' Nelson said.
   The network demanded that the materials be returned.
   CNN is seeking to overturn a federal judge's order blocking it
from airing taped jailhouse conversations between the deposed
Panamanian dictator Noriega and his lawyers.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the complex, had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, the network said.
   The network said the FBI had no warrant and acted over the
objections of a CNN attorney who was present when the material was
taken by the agents. Korn said the attorney ``asked for a warrant
and was not given an answer, and certainly not given a warrant.''
   Johnson said he personally protested the FBI's action ``in the
strongest terms'' to agency officials in Washington.
   The network said a Turner Security official called the FBI
because agents had told him they were looking for ``stolen
government property.'' The network said the material was not
stolen.
   Hotel security officers, believing that CNN reporter Marlene
Fernandez had vacated the hotel room, removed the box Monday and
turned it over to Turner Security, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
said.
   Turner Security returned the box to the hotel security office on
Thursday and then brought FBI agents to the office and gave them
the box, according to Haworth and hotel officials.
   The box contained some papers and at least one videotape, said
Omni General Manager Bill Thompson, who saw the box handed over to
the FBI.
   Johnson said ``it's in dispute'' whether the room was vacated by
Fernandez, who normally anchors CNN's Spanish-language telecasts in
Washington but had been working on the Noriega case.
   Haworth also said ``the people who needed to know did not know''
that Turner Security, another subsidiary of CNN's parent firm
Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., had the box of materials in its
possession.
   The New York Times, citing a CNN source who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the tapes taken were not the Noriega tapes.
``The FBI did not get the main course,'' he said.
   The tapes at the center of the court battle are recordings of
phone conversations between Noriega and his lawyers. On Nov. 8,
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami barred CNN from
broadcasting at least some portions of the seven tapes it has until
Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would endanger
Noriega's right to a fair trial by compromising privileged
attorney-client discussions.
   CNN has refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler. On Thursday,
the network asked a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Anthony M. Kennedy,
to let it broadcast the Noriega-lawyer tapes.
   Earlier this week, lawyers for CNN and Noriega struck an
agreement under which the network will not broadcast tapes of
Noriega talking to his lawyers until receiving some word from the
Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state they are
talking to their lawyers. But CNN said it has tapes that include
conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
