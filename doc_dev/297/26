<HEAD>Judge Asks U.S. Attorney to Prepare Contempt Charges Against CNN</HEAD>

   MIAMI (A) - A federal judge said today he has notified the U.S.
attorney's office to represent him in criminal contempt proceedings
against CNN for broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped prison phone
calls.
   Legal scholars have said a contempt hearing could provide a
judicial test of whether the government can practice prior
restraint on the news media.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable
News Network to broadcast the audio tapes after ruling they did not
violate Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   But he announced in a court hearing last week that he intended
to press contempt charges against the network if it were found to
have defied his initial order banning use of the tape.
   On Wednesday, he notified U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen to draw
up an order asking CNN to show cause why it should not be held in
contempt.
   The network will be allowed to respond in writing, Lehtinen's
spokeswoman Diane Cossin said today. A hearing will be set if
necessary.
   Because the order is against CNN and Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of fines,
not jail terms, Ms. Cossin added.
   Hoeveler said he decided to go forward with the criminal action
because the network defied his restraining order without waiting
first for the outcome of the legal process.
   In Atlanta, network spokesman Steve Haworth said: ``CNN is
confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue of
contempt, its actions will be vindicated.''
   The tape at issue involved a conversation between Noriega and an
investigator, with a defense attorney's secretary translating. The
network broadcast the tape for a day despite Hoeveler's order, but
withdrew it when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
backed the lower court judge. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
involve itself in the matter.
