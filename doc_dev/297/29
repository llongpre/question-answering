   The Supreme Court is condoning at least brief
``gag orders'' against the news media by refusing to let Cable News
Network broadcast tape-recorded conversations of Panama's Gen.
Manuel Noriega, say free press advocates.
   They said the justices' action Sunday was extraordinary and
poses grave risks to unfettered reporting of court proceedings
nationwide.
   Attorney Floyd Abrams, who is representing CNN, said, ``The
court has left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   The high court's 7-2 rejection of CNN's emergency request ``does
seem to countenance brief prior restraints of a few days' duration
based on almost no showing of need at all,'' he said.
   The court's action Sunday effectively bars CNN from broadcasting
tape-recordings of conversations between Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler's order forbidding the broadcasts until he could determine
what is on the tapes.
   The network said it will now turn over the tapes to Hoeveler's
court in Miami.
   Bruce Sanford, a lawyer who represents the Society of
Professional Journalists, said, ``The Supreme Court decision is a
grave disappointment that departs from existing Supreme Court
precedent. It is particularly troublesome because it seems
inconceivable that Noriega's counsel would ever be able to prove
that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the CNN
tapes.''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for
Freedom of the Press, called the development a stunning departure
that ``signals a new era in First Amendment jurisprudence. It will
have a far-reaching impact in ... courts around the country.''
   However, Noriega defense attorney Jon May said, ``We think it's
a correct ruling. This was a major mistake by CNN, a big, big
mistake. This is a case of the messenger shooting itself. To
whatever extent the media may complain this is a significant
adverse decision, CNN has only itself to blame.''
   Only Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor sided
with CNN.
   Marshall, writing for both, said, ``I do not see how the prior
restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled'' with prior high
court rulings. He said Hoeveler's Nov. 8 order barring the CNN
broadcasts is based on the ``remarkable conclusion that publication
can be automatically restrained'' while courts study the basis for
such restraints.
   The seven justices who rejected CNN's application were silent,
leaving it unclear what they believe about the underlying
controversy.
   In the majority were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The high court order does not preclude the justices from some
day deciding that Hoeveler's order did violate CNN's free speech
rights protected by the First Amendment.
   The court could have refused to help CNN on some narrower
grounds and could review the issue at a later date if there is
still a live controversy.
   The Bush administration had joined with Noriega's lawyers in
opposing the CNN request.
   The Justice Department had said, ``The First Amendment is part
of the rule of law, not above it. A lasting prior restraint on
publication may be justified only in the most extraordinary
circumstances. But the rule of law requires permitting a court to
determine if those circumstances exist.''
   In addition to CNN's emergency request, the court also issued a
one-sentence order turning down a formal appeal filed by the cable
network.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   He said he hopes Hoeveler will permit CNN to air the tapes after
reviewing them.
   The federal government lost a much-publicized battle over a
prior restraint in 1971 when the Supreme Court allowed The New York
Times and The Washington Post to publish the so-called Pentagon
papers detailing American involvement in Vietnam.
   But some observers noted that for several days the high court
itself had, in effect, blocked publication while it was reviewing
the dispute.
   The prior restraint then was based on the government's claim
that publication would hurt national security.
   In a key 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a
Nebraska murder case. The court said then that such orders may be
used only as a last resort and that judges first must consider less
drastic measures.
   Noriega, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near MIami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape-record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between inmates and their defense teams.
   But the CNN tape recordings reportedly contain some
conversations between the deposed Panamanian leader and his
lawyers.
   Noriega's lawyers said broadcasting the tapes would create
unfair pretrial publicity, would compromise the confidentiality of
the attorney-client relationship and tip off prosecutors about
defense strategy.
