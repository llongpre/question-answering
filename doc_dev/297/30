<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects CNN Bid To Broadcast Noriega Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has refused to give Cable
News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings of
conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN, meanwhile, is demanding the FBI return a box of recordings
and papers related to the case. The material was taken from an
Atlanta hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed.
   The Supreme Court on Nov. 18 rejected an emergency request by
CNN that was aimed at lifting a federal judge's order forbidding
the broadcasts until he could determine what the tapes disclose.
The vote was 7-2.
   The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional
``prior restraint'' of free speech. But only two justices -
Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor - agreed with that
assessment.
   Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The Justice Department had joined Noriega's lawyers in opposing
the request.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   Johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its
possession over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is ``confident that
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the
prior restraint.''
   Meanwhile, many questions remained about the network material in
the FBI's possession.
   CNN said the tapes and documents were taken by security officers
from an Omni Hotel room that had been used by reporter Marlene
Fernandez, who had been covering the Noriega story.
   Johnson said Fernandez had not checked out of the room, but the
hotel staff, apparently mistakenly, cleared out her room.
   After taking the box from the room, the hotel's security guards
saw that some of its contents were CNN property, he said. They
turned the material over to Turner security officers, from whom the
FBI took the box.
   Johnson said it was still unclear how the FBI was notified about
the box.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the CNN Center
complex, which contains both the hotel and the CNN offices, ``had a
discussion with the FBI inquiring about stolen government property,
and Turner Security told them they had a box that might fit that
description,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said. CNN denied the
material in the box was stolen.
   Haworth said Turner Security - a subsidiary of CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. - did not tell
appropriate CNN officials it had the box.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified CNN official as saying
the actual Noriega recordings were not in the box.
   ``The FBI did not get the main course,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Union Employees of UPI Accept Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union employees of United Press International
on Nov. 16 accepted a proposed 35-percent pay cut for 90 days.
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of the Wire Service Guild, said
the pay cut was approved by 62 percent of those voting. The numbers
voting on each side were not released.
   Dahl spoke by telephone from the union's headquarters in New
York, where the ballots were counted.
   UPI vice president and spokesman Milt Capps said before the vote
that if employees accepted the pay cut, the company would be in a
financial condition to continue operating for 60 to 90 days while
it seeks a buyer.
   The financially troubled, 83-year-old news service already has
cut management salaries by the same percentage for 90 days.
   Capps had said if the pay cut were rejected, UPI might file for
protection under federal bankruptcy laws within days.
   Union officers had recommended rejection, saying the employees
could not afford the pay cut and it would not be enough to keep the
company afloat.
   Dahl said about 310 UPI employees are members of the guild. He
said the total work force covered by the union contract, counting
those who are not members, is close to 400.
   Capps said the company does not give out information on how many
bureaus or how many employees it has at home and abroad. UPI
announced in September that it was closing bureaus in New Mexico,
Wyoming, Montana, Michigan and North Dakota. It has since laid off
an unspecified number of employees.
   The top scale for a newsperson at UPI is approximately $690 a
week.
   The news service, founded in 1907 as United Press, became United
Press International when it merged with Hearst's International News
Service in 1958.
   In recent years, the company encountered financial difficulties
and changed hands three times.
   The original owner, the E.W. Scripps Co., sold it in 1982 to
Media News Corp. of Nashville, Tenn. It continued to lose money and
was sold in 1985 to Mario Vasquez-Rana, a wealthy Mexican newspaper
publisher.
   The present owner is Infotechnology Inc., parent firm to a
number of high-tech ventures.
   Infotechnology announced this month it has retained an
investment banking firm to negotiate the sale of its companies, and
hopes to sell them by the end of the year.
