   A federal judge barred the Cable News Network from
broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped conversations with his lawyers,
saying the ousted Panama dictator's right to a fair trial on drug
charges is in jeopardy.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino said he would demand that the case
against Noriega be dismissed.
   ``We are absolutely shocked and horrified that the United States
government would wiretap General Noriega and his lawyers engaging
in the most sensitive of communications,'' Rubino said.
   But Justice Department officials said the taping was routine,
and that Noriega had known his calls would be monitored. A federal
prison spokesman said it was up to Noriega to inform officials that
he was talking with his attorneys so they would stop the recording.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Thursday told CNN it
couldn't broadcast the tapes, made by prison officials, and
demanded an investigation into how the network got them. He also
ordered the taping stopped.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, in Tampa on Thursday, said
U.S. officials want to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   CNN accused the judge of exercising unconstitutional prior
restraint and demanded an immediate hearing on the issue from the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. No hearing was
immediately scheduled by the appeals court, but Hoeveler scheduled
another hearing in his court for late this afternoon.
   Meantime, he told the news station not to broadcast, at least
through today, any tapes that would interfere with attorney-client
privilege rights.
   ``Because of our belief the order is unconstitutional, we will
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the
courts,'' said CNN President Tom Johnson.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   U.S. Justice Department officials said the taping was routine
and produced a document in English and Spanish that Noriega signed
acknowledging that his phone conversations would be monitored.
   Rubino complained that the taping of Noriega's conversations
violated his client's right to private meetings with his attorneys
and jeopardized his case because the U.S. government now knows his
defense strategy.
   U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Gregory L. Bogdan in Washington
said prisoners are supposed to inform guards when they are talking
to their attorneys so the monitoring can be stopped.
   Federal prosecutors told Hoeveler they haven't heard the tapes.
Rubino was skeptical.
   ``And I believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth
Fairy,'' he said.
   The taping flap is the latest threatening to delay or derail
Noriega's trial on charges he accepted $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling
operations through his country.
   The U.S. government has earmarked $6 million of $20 million in
frozen Noriega assets for payment of his attorneys, but last month
Panama filed a lawsuit accusing Noriega of looting its treasury and
said it would seek to have those assets frozen. Noriega's defense
teams says it needs the money to put together his defense before
the case can go to trial.
   The trial is scheduled to begin early next year, but both sides
agree it will probably be delayed.
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara said Thursday that if the
United States does not go through with the trial, Panama wants
Noriega returned to face charges there.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' he said.
