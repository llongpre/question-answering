   The Supreme Court's handling of the
CNN-Noriega free-press dispute creates a loophole for short-lived
``gag orders'' against the news media.
   Although the court 14 years ago told judges they almost never
may bar the reporting of information already in news media hands,
Sunday's 7-2 vote left intact such a restraint against Cable News
Network.
   The high court's action, however, was not unprecedented and may
not have set any lasting rule of law.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift an order by U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler in Miami forbidding the broadcast of
conversations between Manuel Noriega, the imprisoned former
dictator of Panama, and his lawyers.
   FEderal prison authorities monitor and tape record all inmates'
telephone conversations except when told that inmates are talking
to their lawyers. But CNN reportedly has seven tapes containing
some conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
   When Noriega's lawyers rushed into court to prevent the tapes
from being broadcast, the judge ordered CNN to let him hear the
tapes so he could determine whether fair-trial rights would be
jeopardized. And the judge ruled that CNN could not broadcast the
tapes until his determination was made.
   The cable network, citing a series of Supreme Court decisions,
carried its fight to Washington rather than surrender the tapes.
Now, CNN will submit the tapes to Hoeveler and await his decision
on whether they may be broadcast.
   The ordered delay is itself a prior restraint on reporting -
something the Supreme Court in 1976 called ``the most serious and
least tolerable infringement'' of free-press rights.
   In a key 1976 ruling, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order barring the news media from publishing a Nebraska murder
defendant's confession after it was revealed in a public court
hearing.
   Two of the seven justices who voted against CNN Sunday said in
1976 they seriously doubted whether such prior restraints ever
could be valid.
   Writing for himself in the Nebraska case, Justice Byron R. White
said, ``There is grave doubt in my mind whether orders with respect
to the press such as were entered in this case would ever be
justified.''
   In the same case, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote he might rule
the press never can bE barred from reporting information it has
``no matter how shabby or illegal the means by which the
information is obtained, how serious an intrusion on privacy might
be involved, how demonstrably false the information might be, how
prejudicial it might be ... and how perverse the motivation for
publishing it.''
   Those views could indicate Sunday's vote centered on some issue
narrower than the constitutionality of Hoeveler's gag order.
   If the judge, after listening to the tapes, decides to continue
his ban, CNN could return to the high court. The justices would not
be precluded from ruling at that time that CNN's free-press rights
were violated.
   To some, such a scenario might seem contradictory. But similar
action was taken before the 1976 ruling - Justice HArry A. Blackmun
rejected an emergency request to lift the Nebraska judge's
restraining order pending the full court's decision.
   In 1971, the court ruled the government could not bar The New
York Times and The Washington Post from publishing stories based on
the so-called Pentagon papers detailing U.S. involvement in
Vietnam. But for five days the newspapers were barred by a high
court order from publishing such stories pending its decision.
   And in 1979 the justices rejected an emergency request by The
Progressive magazine, which was then under an order blocking
publication of an article the government said would help other
nations develop a hydrogen bomb.
   The high court refused to order a federal appeals court to speed
up its review of a restraining order issued by a trial judge. The
ban on publishing was in effect for more than seven months.
   Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment expert representing CNN, said
Sunday's action ``left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   But if such tactics are allowed by lower courts, Abrams said,
the Supreme Court might intervene.
   If CNN is not allowed to broadcast its tapes, such Supreme Court
intervention may not be far off.
