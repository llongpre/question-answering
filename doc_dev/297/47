   A U.S. government delegation is in Europe seeking
to unfreeze Manuel Noriega's bank accounts for use in his legal
defense, a federal prosecutor said today.
   The delegation consists of State Department and Justice
Department officials who are visiting Austria and Switzerland, but
most details of their visit are secret, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael Sullivan.
   About $20 million is sitting in 27 Noriega-linked accounts, and
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler has ordered $6 million of
those funds paid into a trust account to cover attorneys fees and
expenses for the deposed Panamanian dictator, who says he has no
other funds.
   The delegation's visit is ``to discuss the possibility of
unfreezing the accounts that are being designated as the
general's,'' Sullivan said. ``the discussions are ongoing.''
   Until the funds are freed, the judge asked Noriega's defense
counsel to take a temporary appointment as government-paid
attorneys, but they id not immediately respond. Lead attorney
Frank Rubino has previously rejected that arrangement because fees
are limited to a maximum of $75 an hour, far less than the $350 an
hour he says is appropriate in a complex drug-trafficking case.
   The U.S. delegation was sent to Europe after Hoeveler said he
would hold a formal hearing to make prosecutors justify freezing
the assets. That would force them to reveal much of their case in
advance, the defense has said.
   The funds were originally frozen at U.S. request following the
December 1989 invasion of Panama and the subsequent capture of
Noriega.
   But in June, the judge ordered the money unfrozen for Noriega's
defense. Last month, however, federal prosecutors told the judge
that foreign governments had initiated their own forfeiture
proceedings, tying up the money.
   Also at today's hearing, the judge said he would set a new trial
date for Noriega, although some of his co-defendants could be tried
on Jan. 28 as planned. Rubino said the defense could not be ready
before June at the earliest, and Hoeveler said he would take that
under advisement.
   The judge also said he wanted a contempt hearing soon against
CNN to determine if the network violated a court order by
telecasting a taped prison telephone call between Noriega and his
defense team. While transcripts from the tapes eventually were made
public, CNN's decision last month to telecast parts of them despite
a court order is still at issue.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said the network had informed him it
will present a full defense against the contempt citation, a
defense which legal experts have said could once again test the
balance between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial.
   Noriega is confined in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami facing charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombian drug traffickers.
