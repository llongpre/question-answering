<LEADPARA>  AS IRAQI missiles exploded in Israel, viewers in Atlanta hungry for the latest
news could choose between CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN and CNN.;    At one point,
each of Atlanta's big-three affiliates had dumped its own network's coverage,
showing instead the feed from Cable News Network. Two independents carried on
many Atlanta cable systems, Chicago's WGN and New York's WOR, also carried
CNN. And purists, of course, could still watch the real thing -- on CNN.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It has happened from coast to coast. In addition to independents running
the CNN feed, network affiliates have joined them, cutting to CNN.;    CNN,
which has 225 TV station affiliates, 130 of them also affiliated with CBS, NBC
or ABC, had no immediate estimate of how many stations carried its coverage of
the missile attack or the start of the war on Wednesday.;    "We feel it's
inappropriate" to discuss the matter, said Sherrie Rollins, spokeswoman for
ABC News, whose Wednesday coverage topped the ratings for all three networks.
"We feel we provide a quality product to the affiliates.";    When the crisis
is over, ABC officials will decide what, if anything, to do about it. "We
believe an affiliate who cuts into our coverage risks losing the right to
carry ABC News coverage," she said.;    CBS News spokeswoman Donna Dees
declined to comment. NBC News officials didn't return phone calls.;    In New
York, the nation's largest TV market, CNN appeared on three stations Wednesday
-- WOR, another independent station, and the Fox station. Two independents and
the CBS and NBC affiliates in Atlanta also carried CNN, the cable network
said.;    In San Francisco, NBC affiliate KRON-TV alternated between NBC and
CNN on Wednesday, said news director Al Goldstein, although "CNN had it first
(live reports of air attacks from Baghdad), and I just took CNN hot."  </TEXT>
