   Manuel Noriega's taped prison conversations were
apparently leaked to CNN by a person assisting the Drug Enforcement
Administration, a federal source said.
   The Miami Herald today identified the source of the leak as Jose
Blandon, a longtime political opponent of Noriega's and a potential
witness against him.
   The FBI is trying to determine who gave the tapes to the
network, which aired some of them over the last month.
   According to court documents filed Friday, prosecutors
subpoenaed 162 Noriega phone recordings made between December and
August at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami.
The deposed Panamanian dictator is jailed there on drug charges.
   But investigators found little of interest and reviewed only 52
of the tapes.
   In late June, 22 tapes were ``reviewed under the direction and
supervision of the DEA case agents, by a person assisting DEA'' in
its criminal investigation against Noriega, the government said in
a filing signed by assistant U.S. attorneys Norman Moscowitz and
Sonia O'Donnell.
   A federal law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that the tapes leaked to CNN
were among those 22, and the individual helping the DEA to review
the tapes was believed responsible.
   The official would not identify the suspect, but said the person
could face criminal charges.
   Quoting unidentified sources, the Herald reported that person
who assisted the DEA was Blandon, a one-time senior intelligence
officer in Panama and Panama's consul general in New York. He
testified before a Senate committee in 1988 that his former boss
Noriega protected U.S.-bound cocaine shipments.
   DEA Washington spokeswoman Illa Brown said the agency could not
discuss pending prosecutions, and referred all questions to the
U.S. attorney's office in Miami. U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said
he could not comment on a pending investigation.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth declined comment. He said the
network does not generally comment on reports from confidential
sources.
   The court documents filed Friday were the prosecution's response
to Noriega's motion to dismiss the case against him on grounds of
government misconduct.
   Attorneys for the deposed Panamanian dictator claimed the
government illegally taped his prison phone calls, undercut his
defense by freezing all his assets and tried to involve lead
defense attorney Frank Rubino in a bribery scheme.
   Lehtinen said Friday the government's response showed there was
no substance to Noriega's charges of misconduct.
   ``The United States maintains that no privileged calls were ever
taped because Noriega was fully advised that all of his telephone
calls would be monitored unless he followed a specific procedure
for privileged calls to his lawyer,'' Lehtinen said. ``Noriega
never invoked that procedure, therefore all of his calls were
properly monitored.''
   Prosecutors said Noreiga, who has unlimited use of a phone
outside his cell, made 1,400 calls between Feb. 1 and Nov. 8.
Nearly all those calls were to his lawyers but some were relayed
overseas by his lawyers, a violation of Bureau of Prisons policy.
   Lehtinen said Noriega's attorneys knew the calls were monitored,
and even discussed that on some of the tapes.
   No hearing date has been set to consider the dismissal motion,
filed last month during the legal battle over CNN's tapes of
Noriega's prison conversations.
   Transcripts of those tapes were made public Thursday after a
request from four news organizations, but most of the conversations
obtained by CNN were in code or about Noriega's personal matters.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through Panama from
Colombia to the United States.
