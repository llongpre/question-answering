   A Miami federal judge expressed concern today about
a growing perception that General Manuel Noriega won't be able to
get a fair trial.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who will preside over the
trial, said he would rule by Thursday on whether taping of Noriega
phone conversations may have prejudiced the case against the former
Panamanian dictator.
   He also told government attorneys he wanted proof that frozen
Noriega funds are drug-tainted, and said he would set another
hearing on the funds issue by next week.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to
be acquiring - that the defendant is not going to be able to get a
fair trial,'' said Hoeveler.
   The judge said today that his ruling on the tapes issue could
extend to more than just whether the tapes violate attorney-client
privilege, but could deal with whether the tapes threaten the
broader drug case against Noriega.
   The tapes were obtained by CNN, which last week turned them over
to Hoeveler. That was after Noriega's defense attorneys moved to
block CNN from airing the tapes, saying they would prejudice the
case against their client.
   Some of the tapes are of Noriega talking to his attorney or
legal representatives.
   Hoeveler transferred the tapes to a federal magistrate in Miami,
and transcripts of them are expected to be ready this afternoon.
   Hoeveler has called a lawyers' conference for Wednesday, and
says he will issue his ruling right after the meeting or sometime
Thursday.
   On the question of Noriega's funds, Hoeveler said he planned to
a schedule a hearing within 10 days. Noriega's attorneys say they
will have to withdraw if they can't get paid because funds are
frozen.
   Hoeveler, who would have to appoint new attorneys, asked the
government to make another effort to get some Noriega funds freed
to pay for his defense. He earlier had said Noriega must have had
some legitimate income in military salary, but prosecutors have
said Panama and other foreign governments have their own forfeiture
actions tying up Noriega's money.
   Prosecutors have indicated they don't want to help the defense
by showing pretrial proof of Noriega's drug links.
   ``The government won't get to try this case by trial by
ambush,'' lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said after today's
hearing.
