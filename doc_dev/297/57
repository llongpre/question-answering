   A U.S. delegation was in Europe on Friday asking
foreign governments to unfreeze Manuel Noriega's bank accounts to
finance his legal defense, but Swiss officials warned their job
won't be easy.
   Most of the delegation's activities are classified, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan, who told a federal judge
here the group consists of State and Justice department officials
visiting Austria and Switzerland.
   Other European nations also may be on the delegation's
itinerary, said U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Diane Cossin.
She refused to identify the countries. The government has said
Noriega had accounts in France.
   Swiss officials expect to hold talks with the delegation next
week, the nation's justice ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said in
Bern.
   But he said if there is any evidence that the accounts contain
illegal drug money, Swiss laws require confiscation.
   ``We can only unfreeze in cases where it is clear that drug
money is not involved. The Americans have to prove that to us,''
Kistler said.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who has pressed the
government to find a way to allow the deposed Panamanian leader to
pay his own lawyers, welcomed the U.S. delegation's efforts.
   ``I'm satisfied at this time they are making a good faith effort
to unfreeze funds for the defense,'' Hoeveler said.
   The judge closed much of a hearing Friday over the objections of
media attorneys. He explained later in open court that ``some of
the areas are legitimately classified.''
   After the December 1989 invasion of Panama and the capture of
Noriega, U.S. authorities asked European governments to freeze
about $20 million in 27 bank accounts. Hoeveler ordered $6 million
of that amount unfrozen in June, but prosecutors returned to him
last month, saying European governments had stepped in with their
own forfeiture proceedings.
   The judge warned he would hold a formal hearing to show whether
the accounts were drug-related, as the government originally
contended. Such a hearing would force the government to reveal much
of its evidence to the defense. The government responded by sending
the delegation to Europe.
   The only delegation member mentioned in open court was Myles
Malman, who is an assistant U.S. attorney and one of Noriega's
prosecutors. State Department officials refused to comment on the
delegation, and the Justice Department's Washington office did not
immediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press.
   The judge has offered the defense temporary appointments as
government-paid lawyers. But Noriega lead attorney Frank Rubino
says that arrangement would impose a maximum of $75 an hour, far
less than the $350 an hour he says is appropriate in a complex
drug-trafficking case.
   Rubino also said the defense could not be ready before June.
Hoeveler said he would set a new trial date for Noriega, although
some of his co-defendants could be tried on the planned date of
Jan. 28.
   The judge said he wanted a contempt hearing soon against Cable
News Network to determine if CNN violated a court order by airing a
taped prison telephone call between Noriega and his defense team.
   The judge subsequently lifted the ban against broadcasting the
tape, but only after warning CNN it still could face contempt
fines.
   Noriega is confined in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami facing charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombian drug traffickers.
