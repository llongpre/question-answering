   Some of Manuel Noriega's taped prison conversations
were in code, including passages in which the deposed Panamanian
dictator apparently discussed frozen funds, court transcripts show.
   Many of the conversations included in transcripts released by a
federal judge Thursday dealt with family affairs, but some
apparently involved money transfers and others showed Noriega
followed Panamanian politics after he was ousted during a U.S.
invasion in December 1989. Among the apparently coded calls was one
by Noriega to the Cuban Embassy in Panama.
   The government tapes, some of which were broadcast by CNN last
month, triggered a battle pitting freedom of the press against
Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   After first ordering CNN to halt the broadcasts, U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler ruled last week that the tapes were harmless
to Noriega's defense, and allowed the network to resume the
broadcasts.
   This week, the judge agreed to a request by media organizations
to release court transcripts of the tapes, over the objections of
CNN. The network dropped its objections Wednesday.
   In one transcript, Norma Amado, mother of Noriega's mistress,
talked in apparent code with him about why ``the man'' had not
arrived. The conversation appeared to be about frozen funds.
   Amado said the man would go elsewhere because ``it's not frozen
there ... since we are all frozen here and over there it wouldn't
be a problem.''
   She also discussed the need for ``a good towel ... and the
important thing is it shouldn't be a hand (towel.)''
   CNN has said that conversation also included coded discussions
about the transfer of $4 million.
   In a call to the Cuban Embassy, Noriega said he would send a
facsimile transmission ``so you can grab it and pass it on to the
grandfather.''
   Another transcript had Noriega urging an unidentified man to
encourage opposition to the new Panamanian government.
   ``We must explain ... that one must unite, that there are people
with ambition that are now going to take over the party,'' he said.
   The transcripts included five tapes, most containing several
conversations.
   In one previously telecast conversation, Noriega speculated
about two potential government witnesses with his lawyer's
secretary, who was translating for a defense investigator. That
conversation triggered the original objection by Noriega's
attorneys, who said broadcastingit would violate lawyer-client
privilege and hurt his chances of getting a fair trial.
   The transcripts showed that Noriega was commenting on an article
in El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language edition of The Miami
Herald, about the arrest of the two men, Alfredo Sanchez and Felipe
Camargo.
   The news organizations that went to court for the transcripts
were The Miami Herald, The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station
WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today, which Gannett
owns. They argued that the public has a right to examine the
content of tapes that ignite a free-speech controversy.
   Noriega's defense team claims the Panamanian government gave the
tapes to CNN after receiving them from the U.S. government. Taping
prisoners telephone callsis legal.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges the he
took $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing
through Panama from Colombia to the United States.
