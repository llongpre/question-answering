   Cable TV magnate Ted Turner on Tuesday named
former Los Angeles Times publisher Tom Johnson as the new president
of his Cable News Network, effective Aug. 1.
   Johnson called himself ``a strong champion of hard news'' who
will try to expand CNN's overseas bureaus. He will succeed Burt
Reinhardt, 70, CNN's president since 1982, who has been with the
network since its start ten years ago.
   Johnson, who joined the Times in 1977 and now is its chairman
and vice-chairman of the parent Times Mirror Co., said he'd first
spoken with Turner about the new job less than a month ago.
   Johnson, whom Turner said was introduced to him by a mutual
friend, said that during his first six weeks at work he'd just
listen and learn. He plans no sweeping changes at CNN, he added:
   ``I am not a believer in Saturday night massacres. I believe in
working with the people who are in place.''
   He and Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting
System, spoke at a telephone news conference from Seattle, site of
the Goodwill Games sports festival that TBS is sponsoring at a
possible loss of $26 million.
   Turner said he made the change because Rheinhardt is 70 ``and
everybody's got to retire some time.''
   Turner emphasized that he has no plans to sell CNN, nor any
plans ``to merge or jointly gather news with any other U.S. news
organizations.''
   NBC several years ago proposed buying part of CNN, but backed
out when Turner refused to give up editorial control of the 24-hour
news organization.
   Johnson, a former White House fellow, was President Johnson's
special assistant in 1968. He was the Times' publisher for nine
years until succeeded last August by David Laventhol, president of
Times Mirror Co.
   Johnson said he's leaving the Times because ``quite frankly, it
was time for a change...I'm looking forward to getting back to
running a media organization.
   ``I feel much more comfortable in a quarterback role than I do a
coaching role,'' he said, alluding to his current jobs in Los
Angeles.
   Asked about his seeming lack of TV experience, Johnson noted
that others have made the transition from print to broadcasting,
including Walter Cronkite and Richard C. Wald, a senior ABC News
execuutive and former NBC News president.
   He also said that he has some experience in broadcasting, having
worked for two years as executive vice president of Texas
Broadcasting Corp., whose holdings included station KBTC-TV in
Austin.
   The company was owned by Lyndon Johnson's family until the
former president's death in 1973.
   CNN says it has 1,700 full and part-time staffers, is seen in 55
million U.S. homes, and has viewers in 90 countries.
   Reinhardt, who CNN says plans to retire later, will become vice
chairman of CNN and advise Johnson during a transition period.
   Johnson also will serve as Turner Broadcasting System's vice
president for news and as a member of TBS' executive committee. He
will report directly to Turner.
