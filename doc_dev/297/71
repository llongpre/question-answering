   Once again, Saddam Hussein met with some of the
Western ``guests'' he holds hostage, an Iraqi TV crew in tow.
   And again, Cable News Network aired the Iraqi satellite
transmission live, enabling CNN viewers to watch along with the
Iraqi public.
   So again, a journalistic debate emerged. Should news operations
give Saddam live access to American television?
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, NBC deputy director of news. ``We made that decision the
first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
aired the Iraqi transmission live on Tuesday, as CNN did. Instead,
they showed portions somewhat later.
   CNN said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as
possible.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that CNN understood that Saddam
would be speaking with American hostages. ``There was no question
in our minds this would be newsworthy.''
   CNN explained to viewers that the broadcast was an Iraqi TV
feed. And afterward, CNN featured a debate over the wisdom of the
decisions it had made.
   It's a decision the other networks see differently.
   At NBC, ``we would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first
knowing what it was,'' McFarland said. ``We took every frame of it
into the house, looked at it, and then selected two or three
bites.''
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins, ABC
director of news information. The president of ABC News has to
approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television on Thursday with Western
hostages, ABC joined the Iraqi satellite feed live for a few
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content
of the material.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Tuesday, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report by anchorman Peter Jennings, she said.
   After Tuesday's coverage on CNN, Pati Heath of Detroit, the
sister of an American hostage, called the Atlanta-based network to
say she had seen her brother on TV.
   CNN then put her on television, too.
   ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,'' she
said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.''
   During Tuesday's meeting between Saddam and the hostages _ whom
he calls ``guests'' _ a woman with a British accent was heard
asking Saddam why he was using foreign children ``in something they
can't understand.''
   He responded with a long answer about the threat to his nation
from Western troops. But later Tuesday, the Iraqi News Agency
reported that women and children held in Iraq would be free to go,
and that Saddam had changed his mind because of the concern
expressed by the foreign families during the meeting.
   ``I don't think it's coincidental,'' Haworth said.
