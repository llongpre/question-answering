CBS, TURNER NEWS LINKUP IS RUMORED; 
</P>
<P>

FOR CNN AND CBS.

<P>
CBS Inc. is close to an agreement on a news linkup with its former foe Ted 
Turner, the cable television magnate whose unwanted 1985 takeover bid forced 
the network into a painful restructuring, industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The sources say CBS will likely announce this month that it will cooperate with 
Turner's Cable News Network in foreign news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperation pact would help struggling CBS, which has had a series of 
failures in its overseas news coverage. It would also save the network money in 
what is a notoriously expensive area for broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Moving a correspondent to cover a story overseas can easily cost several 
thousand dollars a day, since it also means that a camera crew, producer and 
tape editor will be sent, along with hundreds of pounds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman had no comment on a possible CNN deal and said 
no announcements were pending. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Hayworth, director of public relations for CNN, confirmed published 
reports that talks have taken place with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"Discussions have taken place on a number of matters, including news matters, 
but I've got no comment on the proximity of an agreement or whether there is an 
agreement pending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Exact details of the proposed linkup or any financial terms were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Sources within CBS note that the network, consistently ranked No. 3 in both its 
morning and evening newscasts, has suffered setbacks recently in coverage in 
Panama, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
With television news coverage an increasing cash drain in a bottom-line 
sensitive industry, CBS has been cutting back its foreign operations. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, CBS, whose reputation for quality once gave it the nickname 
the "Tiffany network," has closed bureaus in Bonn, Paris, Hong Kong, Bangkok, 
Beirut, Cairo and Athens. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News, now No. 1 in the evening news ratings, has close links with the news 
film service WTN, which supplies footage to broadcasters around the world, 
serving as a "wire service" for networks. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has gone even further, taking a 38% stake in Visnews, another news film 
agency. NBC and Visnews now share some offices overseas.
