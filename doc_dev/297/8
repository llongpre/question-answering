   In a cost-saving experiment that may be tried
elsewhere overseas, Cable News Network and CBS News will share a
bureau and satellite equipment in Berlin, a CNN official said
Friday.
   The test will start in mid-June and is a ``a limited
experiment'' in which the two organizations will maintain separate
news correspondents and producers, said Ed Turner, executive vice
president of CNN.
   Turner's comments came during a telephone interview about the
upcoming 10th anniversary of CNN.
   CBS News officials would not comment on the unique sharing of
office space with a still-growing cable rival. ``We have no
announcement to make,'' said CBS spokesman Tom Goodman.
   The Berlin bureau arrangement marks the second deal between CBS
and a company owned by Atlanta cable tycoon Ted Turner, who
unsuccessfully tried to buy CBS in 1986.
   Last September, Turner Network Television announced a $50
million contract with CBS that lets TNT show 50 hours of coverage
from the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS owns the U.S.
television rights to those Games.
   The CNN-CBS News arrangement in Berlin is ``really more symbolic
than anything else,'' said Ed Turner, who is not related to CNN's
owner.
   What is unusual about it is two rival TV news organizations
``cohabiting under the same roof and sharing a (satellite) feed
point and saving each other a little money,'' he said. ``And we'll
see where it goes from there.''
   Asked if there might be similar CBS-CNN arrangements elsewhere
overseas, Turner replied that ``we're looking at some, but right
now there's nothing to talk about.''
   The cost-saving effort comes at a time that all the major
networks are trying to find ways to reduce or share costs of news
coverage overseas.
   Several years ago, NBC bought nearly 38 percent of Visnews, a
London-based overseas TV news service. Visnews' majority owner is
the Reuters news company, but the British Broadcasting Corp. also
owns an 11.25 percent interest.
   NBC and Visnews recently began sharing the same office in
Moscow, and the BBC uses NBC's satellite equipment there to
transmit stories to London, NBC said.
   ABC owns 45 percent of another London-based overseas TV news
service, Worldwide Television News. Subscribers to the service
include ABC News, CBS News and CNN.
