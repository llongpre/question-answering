<HEAD>CNN Announces Co-Anchors For Newscast</HEAD>

   Cable News Network today said CNN newsman
Bernard Shaw and a former Texas judge will be co-anchors of ``The
World Today,'' a new evening newscast that will go head to head
with the big three networks.
   The former judge, 34-year-old Catherine Crier, has no news
background. When hired last month by CNN, she resigned as a state
judge in Dallas. She was elected to that job in 1985.
   CNN's new one-hour newscast, which premieres Monday, will start
at 6 p.m. EDT. Its second half hour will compete directly with the
nightly newscats of CBS, NBC and ABC, but only in Eastern and
Central time zones.
   Those networks, which at 6:30 p.m. EDT give their affiliates the
first of two half-hour ``feeds'' of their nightly newscasts, tape
their newscasts for broadcast three hours later on the West Coast,
sometimes updating them with live reports. CNN's new show will be
fed live nationally.
   Crier will be co-anchor of ``The World Today'' from CNN
headquarters in Atlanta, and Shaw from CNN's headquarters in
Washington.
