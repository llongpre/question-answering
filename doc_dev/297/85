Call it the CNN paradox: At the hour of day when most TV viewers watch a 
network news broadcast, the one network devoted solely to news has had no 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as it approaches its 10th anniversary, CNN finally has a "flagship" 
broadcast of its own. Starting tonight, CNN will broadcast "The World Today" 
from 6 to 7 p.m. EDT weeknights and for the first time compete directly with 
the nightly news seen on ABC, CBS and NBC (except on the West Coast, where "The 
World Today" will be seen from 3 to 4 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Until now, CNN's strategy has been to counter network news programming by 
offering viewers something different -- most recently a show-business report 
and financial news -- to compete in the East and Midwest against ABC's "World 
News Tonight" with Peter Jennings, "The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather" and 
"NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw. But with 70% of network news viewers 
catching the 6:30 p.m. Eastern broadcasts, it occurred to CNN executives that 
their channel was missing an opportunity to attract people who were accustomed 
to hard news at that hour. 
</P>
<P>
"This is when people go shopping for their news," said Paul Amos, executive 
vice president of news programming for CNN, "and we need to be on the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
With its entry into the nightly news war, where star power is deemed a key 
factor, CNN has teamed its most visible newscaster, veteran Bernard Shaw, who 
will anchor from Washington, with newcomer Catherine Crier, who is as fresh a 
face as there is in broadcast journalism -- she's never worked in TV news 
before. Before landing at the anchor desk in CNN's Atlanta headquarters, based 
on her audition for a proposed CNN talk show, Crier was an assistant district 
attorney and then a state district court judge in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the three broadcast networks have talked about expanding their 
half-hour evening newscasts, in part to ease time limitations on reporting as 
well as to add a new dimension to a format that has remained virtually 
unchanged for more than 20 years. But they've been blocked by their affiliated 
stations, which don't want to relinquish even 15 minutes of what is their most 
lucrative local programming time. 
</P>
<P>
Now CNN has beaten them to it, creating considerable interest in "The World 
Today" among TV journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another competitor," says William Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC 
Nightly News." "And we are all curious about how they are going to do it, 
because this would really be the first evening 'news hour.' All of us have 
thoughts on how we would do an hour." 
</P>
<P>
(He and other TV newsmen don't regard PBS' "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" the 
same way because, although it too is an hourlong nightly news show, it is 
noncommercial and uses a different format from the traditional network 
newscasts.) 
</P>
<P>
"The World Today," as planned, will be divided into two half hours, the first 
consisting of interviews and in-depth treatment of news and issues; some 
reports might last up to 20 minutes, heretofore virtually unheard of in a 
nightly newscast. The hour's second half will come closer to the traditional 
nightly news format by presenting an overview of the day's important events. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kaczaraba, executive producer of "The World Today," described the program 
as "a little more sophisticated" than CNN's usual broadcasts, which tend toward 
straightforward, unadorned delivery of the news with stories repeated and 
updated frequently. "The World Today" will have its own set and present a 
package of freshly produced reports, which will be updated on subsequent 
broadcasts, most notably "PrimeNews" (5 p.m. PDT) and "CNN Evening News" (7 
p.m. PST). 
</P>
<P>
CNN's decision to go head-to-head with the network newscasts is, by all 
accounts, necessary for the network's growth as an influential news 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"To truly come into their own, they do need a kind of signature broadcast," 
said Everette Dennis, director of the Gannett Center for Media Study at 
Columbia University. The new broadcast, he said, is "a sign of maturation" for 
CNN, which went on the air in June, 1980, as Ted Turner's upstart in the TV 
news business. Today, CNN, which reaches 51 million cable subscribers, is 
regarded as an equal alongside the three network news divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Today" isn't expected to have an immediate effect on the network 
newscasts, each of which, despite a slight decline in audience during the last 
few years, still attract an average of 8.5 million households nightly. In 
contrast, about 500,000 households have been tuning in for CNN's early 
"Newswatch" broadcast and the half-hour "Showbiz Today," which will move to 
2:30 p.m. PDT starting today. "Moneyline" will continue to air at 4 p.m. PDT, 
following "The World Today." 
</P>
<P>
Even CNN executives say wooing viewers from the long-established network 
newscasts will be a gradual process, because viewing habits are hard to break. 
"We do not expect a tidal wave coming out of the blocks," says CNN's Amos. "One 
thing we are cognizant of is that news programming takes a long time to build 
an audience."
