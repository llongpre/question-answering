   Iraqi officials censored a CNN report Wednesday
in which a woman who had been trapped in Kuwait said Iraqis killed
people simply because they had pictures of the country's deposed
emir.
   As in previous cases, the report was censored by fast-forwarding
past the woman's comments during the report's satellite
transmission from Baghdad, making her words unintelligible, a Cable
News Network spokesman said.
   However, correspondent Tom Mintier, who filed CNN's report from
Baghdad, called a colleague in Jordan with his recollection of the
woman's comments, which was relayed to CNN in Atlanta for a later
broadcast, CNN said.
   The woman, whose name was not released, was on a London-bound
charter flight filled with foreigners who had been trapped in
Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of that country, said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth.
   She was interviewed during the flight's stopover in Baghdad, he
said.
   The woman was quoted as saying that ``they (Iraqis) are killing
them for having pictures of the emir and paper flags the kids have
for school. They are killing them for this. It's getting really
bad.''
   The woman apparently referred to Kuwaitis and paper replicas of
the flag of Kuwait, he said.
   Iraqi censorship of U.S. network reports, occuring even as Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein continues to try to portray himself
positively on television, is neither unusual nor yet excessive,
network officials say.
   ``It's a common experience among all the networks,'' said Ed
Turner, CNN's executive vice president for newsgathering.
   Turner said another network's shot of baking pita bread was
censored and yet another ``had a sound bite from Saddam himself,
and that was fast-forwarded.''
   CNN has been censored about six times, which is ``not so many as
to be onerous, but it is annoying,'' Turner said.
   Each time, including Wednesday, CNN showed the full report as it
was received from Baghdad, but noted which parts were censored.
   Iraqi officials seem more concerned with pictures than words,
although Wednesday's incident involved both.
   NBC News foreign editor David Miller said since last week, three
taped NBC reports, all about hostages, were censored during
satellite transmission.
   The correspondent's words were not altered, but the picture was
blurred, he said.
   Each time, the ``NBC Nightly News,'' aired the full report.
   Iraqi censors seem most sensitive to reports on hostages, said
CBS foreign editor Al Ortiz. But the censorship has not been so
severe ``that we haven't been able to...still manage to get the
story reported,'' he said.
   Miller said there are no advance warnings from Iraqi officials
and they seem to have no rules.
   ``I don't think they have guidelines...there's no set of rules
the way the U.S. military (in Saudi Arabia) does it.''
