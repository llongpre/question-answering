   In a cost-saving test that might be tried
elsewhere overseas, Cable News Network and CBS News will share a
bureau and satellite facilities in Berlin, says CNN executive vice
president Ed Turner.
   The test will start in mid-June and is a ``a limited
experiment'' in which the two organizations will maintain separate
correspondents and producers, he says.
   CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman said Wednesday the network had no
comment on what would be a unique sharing of office space with a
still-growing cable rival.
   Although an experiment and on a small scale, the Berlin bureau
arrangement would be the second deal between CBS and a company
owned by Atlanta cable tycoon Ted Turner, who tried to buy CBS in
1986.
   Last September, Turner Network Television announced a $50
million contract with CBS that lets TNT show 50 hours of coverage
from the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS owns the U.S.
television rights to those Games.
   The CNN-CBS News arrangement in Berlin is ``really more symbolic
than anything else,'' Ed Turner, no relation to CNN's owner, said
in an interview last week.
   What is unusual about it is two rival TV news organizations
``cohabiting under the same roof and sharing a (satellite) feed
point and saving each other a little money,'' he said. ``And we'll
see where it goes from there.''
   Asked if there might be similar CBS-CNN arrangements elsewhere
overseas, Turner replied that ``We're looking at some, but right
now there's nothing to talk about.''
   The cost-saving effort comes at a time all the major networks
are trying to reduce or share costs of news coverage overseas.
   Several years ago, NBC bought nearly 38 percent of Visnews, a
London-based overseas TV news service. Visnews' majority owner is
the Reuters news company, but the British Broadcasting Corp. also
owns an 11.25 percent interest.
   NBC and Visnews recently began sharing the same office in
Moscow, and the BBC uses NBC's satellite facilities there to
transmit its stories to London, according to NBC.
   ABC owns 45 percent of another London-based overseas TV news
service, Worldwide Television News, whose subscribers include ABC
News, CBS News and CNN.
