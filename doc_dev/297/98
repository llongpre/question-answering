   ATLANTA -- This country's appetite for television news
during the Soviet crisis was strong, but not nearly as strong
as it was during the Persian Gulf War.
   Cable News Network's average viewership in the U.S. jumped
to 1.6% of its 59.3 million households Monday, after Soviet
hard-liners seized power from Mikhail Gorbachev, and inched
up to 1.7% Tuesday, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings
released by CNN. (Ratings aren't yet available for
yesterday.)

   The figures represent a more than threefold increase from
CNN's average ratings in June and July, the network said. But
they were still a far cry from its ratings after the U.S.
attacked Iraq: 7.3% on the first day of the war and 9.5% on
the second. CNN's ratings this week were also lower than they
were during the San Francisco earthquake and the U.S.
invasion of Panama, both in 1989.
   During the early days of the Gulf War, CNN, a unit of
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., ran almost nothing but live
reports on the crisis. This week, by contrast, the network
has stuck to its regular 24-hour news format, including
interview shows and sports and entertainment news, but has
broken away to present live reports and press conferences.
   A spokesman said that CNN will keep a satellite slot from
Moscow available around the clock "until well after
Gorbachev's return" to that city.
