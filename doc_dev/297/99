Aggressive expansion by CNN television network

Along with the movie Gone with the Wind, Martin Luther King and its baseball
team the Braves, Atlanta is probably best known throughout the US as home to
CNN, the all-news cable television network which sprung to national - and
international - prominence several years ago with its coverage of the Gulf
War.
Yet, the benefits CNN bring to the city go beyond the kudos of national
name-recognition. The network, which is part of the giant entertainment
group Turner Broadcasting System owned by Mr Ted Turner, is also a leading
employer in the metropolitan area as well as a considerable tourist
attraction. The CNN Centre in downtown Atlanta is visited daily by many
hundreds, eager to see at first-hand the production of CNN's television
programming.
The network has come a long way from the early 1980s, when it was widely
derided as 'Chicken Noodle News.' The brainchild of Mr Turner, who foresaw a
demand for 24-hour television news long before anyone else, CNN is regarded
as an important news source for a hardcore audience of US viewers, and as
essential viewing in times of national and international crisis by many
more.
However, CNN's ratings have never been that large - it typically attracts
about 400,000 viewers in the US - and recently its ratings have begun to
slide. In the first quarter of this year, CNN's ratings in the US were down
25 per cent on the same period of 1993, and in the first six months of this
year lower ratings contributed to flat advertising revenues. Without
continued growth in CNN International, the network's non-US operation, CNN
would have reported a decline in revenues for the first half of 1993.
Yet, some of the decline in ratings cannot be blamed on CNN itself - like
any news service, it needs big news events to keep viewers tuned in, and
during the first half of 1994 a lack of big news, combined with improving
competition from local newscasts and specialist news magazines, took their
toll. (Although the double-murder story involving sports star OJ Simpson was
huge news in the US, CNN faced stiff competition from local news purveyors
and specialist channels such as Court TV).
The recent weakness in domestic ratings, however, cannot obscure the fact
that CNN remains a handsomely profitable business for its parent TBS. Last
year, it generated an operating profit of Dollars 231m on revenues of almost
Dollars 600m.
Moreover, CNN's ratings have always moved with the news cycle, and the third
quarter of 1994 produced two big stories with a strong US and international
dimension - the crisis in Haiti and the threat of another invasion of Kuwait
by Iraq - could pay off in the form of higher viewership for the second half
of this year.
Furthermore, the maturing of its domestic market need not be so worrying as
long as CNN continues to build revenues from its international operation.
After years of losing money, CNNI is now in profit and the fastest-growing
arm of CNN. Its revenues last year totalled about Dollars 100m, and this
year CCNI is expected to earn between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m on
revenues of Dollars 113m. That is a considerable improvement from four years
ago, when CNNI lost a little over Dollars 3m on revenues of just Dollars
13.6m.
This growth has come from aggressive expansion into new markets in three
main regions - Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. It has been
accomplished mostly by adding new satellites that carry larger 'footprints'
which enable CNNI's programmes to be broadcast on a more powerful signal to
homes in a much wider geographic area. As a consequence, as of this summer,
CNNI was transmitting to an estimated 80m television households in more than
210 countries via a network of 12 satellites.
To improve CNNI's news programming, CNN has built a new Dollars 11m
production centre in Atlanta to complement its existing European regional
centre in London, and it will soon open a new Asian regional centre in Hong
Kong. Each centre will produce a version of CNNI programming geared toward
its region's viewers.
In South America, CNN has no English-language competition, but faces a
threat from several Spanish-language networks run by Reuters, the Mexican
television group Televisa, and the US network NBC.
CNNI competes indirectly with them through the four half-hour segments of
Spanish-language news it broadcasts every day, but clearly could lose ground
to the native-language news services because the number of fluent
English-speakers in the region is so small.
In Europe, CNNI's largest market, the principal competition comes from Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Sky News channel. Although Sky is very UK-oriented, Mr
Peter Vesey, head of CNNI, admits: 'On some stories with a particular
European interest, they can be very competitive with us in serving their
UK-based audience.'
Another competitor is Euronews, which was set up by a political mandate from
the European Community and broadcasts news in five different languages -
'it's a wonderful technical achievement,' says Mr Vesey, 'but it's not, from
what I hear, a very watchable product.' CNN could also face competition soon
from the BBC, which has talked of moving into the European market on a
subscription basis with a version of World Service TV.
CNN also competes indirectly with the BBC in the Asia-Pacific region, as it
does with Star TV satellite system, which is the largest in Asia and which
may eventually be part of a global sattelite news service alongside Mr
Murdoch's Fox Television in the US and Sky News in Europe. Mr Vesey says of
CNNI's global competition: 'As you can see, the field is kind of crowded.'
In future, however, CNNI may be competing more with native-language
broadcasters, although here the network has tried to hedge its bets through
its occasional Spanish-language broadcasts and a joint venture with German
broadcasters in Germany called n-tv.
Mr Vesey says: 'We will see more regional competition, but I don't think it
will be English-language competition. If I was to spend a ton of money on
bringing you Asia every day, I would probably choose to do it in Chinese, or
maybe Japanese. That is one of the biggest dilemmas we have classically
faced. English is the best language to be in - on a worldwide basis - but
you're really limiting yourself in terms of a mass audience, and there's no
way around that. The way to extend and expand beyond that is to go the n-tv
route in Europe. If you're going to take it into the region and tell people
about things that are most important to them, you've got to make the
decision to do it in their language.'
The CNNI chief, however, is confident that its head start of 15-years
experience in global news production should allow it to stay ahead of the
international field.
