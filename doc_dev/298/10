   Potlatch Corp., citing improved markets and production efficiencies, posted a 30% rise in first-quarter net income on a 6.6% increase in sales. 

   The forest products concern reported net of $17.8 million, or 63 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier period's $13.6 million, or 47 cents a share. 
First-quarter sales were $248.6 million, compared with $233.3 million a year earlier. 

   Per-share figures reflect a previously announced 2-for-1 stock split payable May 4. 

   The company said the earnings rise came despite an increase in its tax rate to 39% in the latest quarter from 30% the year before. 

   Cost-cutting measures, increased volume and firming prices boosted pre-tax profit at the company's wood products group to $6.3 million from $900,000 a year earlier, Potlatch said. 
Printing paper, pulp and paperboard operations also showed improvement, largely because of price increases. 
But the company said market pressure cut earnings for Potlatch's consumer products division, which makes private-label and generic household tissue. 

   Richard B. Madden, chairman and chief executive officer, said he expects "continued strong results" in the immediate months ahead.
