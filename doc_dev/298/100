   Sagging demand and prices for building products caused Louisiana-Pacific Corp.'s third-quarter profit to drop 11%, but its larger Northwest competitor, Weyerhaeuser Co., reported a 15% earnings gain from soaring demand for pulp, paper and containerboard. 

   Louisiana-Pacific, based in Portland, Ore., said it earned $36.7 million, or 96 cents a share, compared with $41.4 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. 
Sales were nearly flat at $462.9 million, compared with $461 million a year ago. 

   "Uncertainty over interest rates and declining housing starts are reducing demand and lowering prices of most building products," said Harry A. Merlo, chairman and president of the forest products company. 
Lumber prices were down 10% from last year's third quarter, with plywood and paneling off 8.5% and 14% respectively. 

   Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, Wash., also reported softness in prices for lumber and structural panels, as well as curtailed logging because of extreme fire hazards in the Pacific Northwest. 
These adverse trends helped cause earnings growth in the third quarter to slow from the first-half rate. 
But the softness was significantly offset by "extraordinarily strong" demand for pulp and paper products, the company said. 

   The company reported net of $144.8 million, or 70 cents a share, for the third quarter, compared with $126.1 million, or 59 cents a share, in the year-ago period. 
Sales amounted to $1.96 billion, up 8% from $1.82 billion. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Louisiana-Pacific shares rose 25 cents to close at $29, while Weyerhaeuser shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $24.125.
