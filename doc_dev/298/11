   Potlatch, citing a strong market for pulp products and a drop in its tax rate, said second-quarter net income rose 15% while sales slipped 2.4%. 
The forest-products concern said net was $22.3 million, or 80 cents a share, while sales totaled $243.9 million. 
The San Francisco-based company said operating profit fell at its wood products and printing paper operations, but the downturn was offset by a higher operating profit from its pulp, paperboard and packaging group. 
The company said its tax rate decreased to 31.4% from 35% a year earlier. 
For the six months, Potlatch's net rose 21% to $40.1 million, or $1.43 a share. 
Revenue rose 1.9% to $492.5 million.
