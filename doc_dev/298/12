   Potlatch Corp., San Francisco, posted a 64% drop in
second-quarter profit to $11.8 million, or 41 cents a share,
from $32.3 million, or $1.12 a share, a year ago.
   The forest-products maker blamed a weakening market for
pulp-based items and several one-time charges, including the
cost of an early retirement program for employees in Idaho
and Arkansas. Sales eased 1.5% to $316.6 million from $321.2
million a year earlier. The one-time charges totaled $4.6
million in the latest quarter, Potlatch said.

   Earnings also were hurt by higher wood costs and slower
sales of its coated paper products, which necessitated price
cuts.
