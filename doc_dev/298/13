   Potlatch Corp. said it plans to close a 70-year-old sawmill in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and expand operations at a Lewiston, Idaho, mill scheduled for renovation this spring. 

   The forest products concern said it will close the Coeur d'Alene mill, which employs 225 workers, by year-end. 
The Lewiston mill, which will shut down this spring for a number of months while it undergoes a $35 million makeover, will ultimately employ as many as 110 additional workers by adding a third shift, Potlatch said. 
Some workers affected by the Coeur d'Alene mill's closing will be offered jobs at the plant, a spokesman added. 

   Potlatch also said it intends to restart a plywood plant in Lewiston because of the mill's increased output.
