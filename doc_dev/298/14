   What's the price of hope? In the case of Potlatch, about
$10 a share.
   As recently as May 14, shares of Potlatch, a Walnut Creek,
Calif., paper company with annual sales of about $1.2
billion, were trading at 35. But in less than two weeks, they
have surged 31%, including Friday's 3-point gain to 45 3/4.
Sparking the rise has been a rumor that International Paper
was seeking to acquire Potlatch for 60 a share. Some Street
scuttlebutt had it that Wasserstein Perella would act as
adviser to the acquirer.

   In several ways, Potlatch would be a good fit for
International Paper. And it has operations that might be
attractive to other acquirers. Yet there are reasons to be
skeptical, too.
   Rumors said a friendly deal was in the works. But in reply
to a shareholder's question at Potlatch's annual meeting late
Friday, Chief Executive Richard Madden said the company isn't
for sale. Potlatch has strong defenses against a hostile
takeover, and International Paper has the reputation of
avoiding hostile deals.
   On Friday, an International Paper spokesman, William
Fuller, declined to comment on the Potlatch rumor. But he
said International Paper's overall strategy calls for getting
an increasing share of sales from international operations.
That goal seems inconsistent with acquiring Potlatch, which
gets about 92% of its revenue in the U.S.
   "Companies such as ours cannot be entirely dependent on
the fortunes of a single national economy," Mr. Fuller said.
"Looking at the world-wide economic scene, we see economic
growth {abroad} at least in the short term outstripping that
in the U.S."
   International Paper's last two acquisitions -- Aussedat
Rey and Zanders -- were in Europe. In 1990 it got 32% of its
revenue from international operations, and Mr. Fuller said
the company expects this figure to be 35% in 1991.
   Beyond that, Mr. Fuller would say only that International
Paper is interested in acquiring companies with specialized
"value-added" products. Whether Potlatch fits that bill -- it
is big in bleachboard and coated paper -- is a matter of
judgment, and Mr. Fuller wouldn't comment. A Wasserstein
Perella spokesman also declined to comment.
   If the rumors are true, there is still a potential gain of
another 30% in the stock. But several money managers say
Potlatch is overvalued if the rumors aren't true.
   Absent a takeover, Potlatch stock is "expensive any way
you want to figure it -- price to earnings, price to cash
flow, or price to assets," says one money manager. He owns
several paper stocks, but Potlatch isn't among them.
   Potlatch now fetches 18 times the past 12 months'
per-share earnings figure of $2.46. The stock price is
slightly above the sales-per-share figure, $42.12. According
to Oppenheimer &amp; Co., the average paper and forest products
stock sells for about 60 cents per dollar of sales.
   Saul Yaari, analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in
Minneapolis, likes the company but is of two minds about the
takeover talk. "The two companies would create a very good
business combination," he says. For example, Potlatch has a
bleachboard plant in Lewiston, Idaho, while International
Paper has such plants in the South and the East.
   However, the Weyerhaeuser family controls at least 40% of
Potlatch's stock -- more, by Mr. Yaari's estimate. Since the
family also dominates Weyerhaeuser, a major bleachboard
producer on the West Coast, Mr. Yaari doubts that the family
would encourage the acquisition.
   George Weyerhaeuser, Weyerhaeuser's chief executive,
couldn't be reached for comment Friday, but is said to have
told others that the family holdings are widely dispersed and
aren't voted as a block.
   George Adler of Smith Barney recommends Potlatch stock,
but seems uneasy with the current price. About a month ago,
he predicted that the shares would reach 43 by mid-1992. Now
they're there already. "There is risk in the stock at this
point," Mr. Adler says. "It could drop {back to 35} if the
rumor gets shot down."
   "A number of companies would love to get in the high-end
coated printing paper area," he says. "It's a rapid growth
field {with} very few players." But he adds that "the paper
industry is in a deep recession right now."
   Kenneth Hackel, who runs Systematic Financial Management
in Fort Lee, N.J., says Potlatch is "not a good acquisition
candidate" because its free cash flow has been erratic. (Free
cash flow is essentially available cash that a business could
pay out in dividends or use to make acquisitions or capital
improvements.) Companies "have learned from the LBO
{leveraged buy-out} craze of the 1980s {that} they've got to
buy companies that generate consistent free cash flow," he
says.
   J. David Mills, co-manager of the Boston Co. Capital
Appreciation Fund, says he doesn't know if the rumors are
true or not, but doubts Potlatch could get higher than 60 in
the next few years, even with a takeover. "So there's not a
lot of upside," he says. He doesn't think the potential gain
is worth the speculation.
   "Let's say the takeover rumors die down," says Mr. Yaari
of Piper. "I think the stock will give away what it gained
because of the speculation, and go into the high 30s, at
which time we will recommend it as a good long-term
investment."
