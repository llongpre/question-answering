   Potlatch Corp. said fourth-quarter profit grew 24% to $24.9 million, or 89 cents a share, from $20.1 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales grew 3.9% to $252.7 million from $243.3 million. 

   The San Francisco-based company said improved productivity and strong markets for its lumber products helped it post record earnings in 1987. 

   For the year, net climbed 25% to $87.6 million, or $3.13 a share, from $69.9 million, or $2.49 a share, in 1986. 
Sales edged up to $992.1 million from $976.4 million. 

   The company said that the outlook for most of its forest-product markets is "generally good" but that some price erosion occurred in the fourth quarter in markets for wood products.
