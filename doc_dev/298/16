   SAN FRANCISCO -- Potlatch Corp. and Simpson Paper Co.
entered into a consent decree and agreed to pay fines
totaling $12 million to settle a civil suit charging
pollution of coastal waters near Los Angeles.
   The lawsuit, filed in 1990 by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and by California, alleged that
the discharge of chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls
by the forest products companies and other corporations had
damaged marine resources off the Southern California shore.

   Potlatch operated a paper mill in Pomona, Calif., from
1952 to 1979, when it was sold to San Francisco's Simpson
Paper Co., a unit of Simpson Investment Co., Seattle. The
mill, which recycled waste paper, was alleged to be a source
of PCBs.
   Under the consent decree, which is subject to court
approval, Potlatch will pay $9.5 million and Simpson will pay
$2.5 million over four years. Potlatch said it has brought an
action for declaratory relief to recover the settlement
amount from its insurance carriers.
