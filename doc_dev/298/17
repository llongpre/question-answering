   SAN FRANCISCO -- Potlatch Corp. said it expects a
significant drop in first-quarter earnings, reflecting slow
wood-product sales and the cost of two early retirement
programs.
   The company said profit would be "down significantly" from
$37 million, or $1.28 a share, a year ago.

   Falling lumber prices resulting from the recession and
overcapacity on the pulp and paper manufacturing side of the
business have hurt profits throughout the industry.
   Potlatch closed at $32.25, down 62.5 cents, in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
