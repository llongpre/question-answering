<LEADPARA>  Boise Cascade Corp. reported a 92 percent drop in net income for the fourth
quarter of 1990, and Chairman John Fery said prospects don't look much better
for the first period of 1991.;    The Boise-based forest products company
reported fourth- quarter profits of $4.8 million, or 4 cents per share, far
below the profit of $51.3 million, or $1.10 per share, for the same period one
year earlier.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sales declined to $1 billion from $1.1 billion in the 1989 quarter.;   
Fery said the decline in income reflected weaker prices for many of the
company's paper and wood products, the effects of a slowing U.S. economy and
increased interest expense.;    Fery said he expected the difficult
environment to continue for the first quarter of 1991 because of the soft
economy, poor market conditions for many of the paper grades that the company
produces, weak prices for wood products and increased interest. However, he
said he expects most of the company's paper mills to operate with increased
efficiency, reflecting the completion of a number of capital projects.;   
Boise Cascade isn't alone reporting problems in the Pacific Northwest timber
industry. Potlatch Corp. announced last week it was placing 400 employees at
its Clearwater mill at Lewiston on indefinite furlough.;    In an appearance
before a legislative committee, Joe Hinson, spokesman for the Idaho Forest
Industry Association, predicted the industry could lose 1,000 jobs in the
first half of the year.;    For the year, Boise Cascade had net income of
$75.3 million, or $1.62 per share, down 72 percent from profits of $267.6
million, $5.70 per share, in 1989. Sales for 1990 were $4.2 billion vs. $4.3
billion in 1989.  </TEXT>
