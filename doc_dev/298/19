   Potlatch Corp. said it plans to spend $21.4 million to construct an additional turbine generator at its Lewiston, Idaho, plant, in a move it expects will over time provide "significant energy cost reductions." 

   The forest products concern, which is based in San Francisco, said the project is scheduled to start in July 1990. 

   Potlatch also said a planned $36 million expansion of its Bemidji, Minn., wood panel plant may be delayed because of "recent new interpretations of federal environmental regulations." 
The company didn't elaborate.
