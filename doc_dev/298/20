   Potlatch Corp. said its board approved as much as $45.5 million in capital expenditures. 

   The forest products company said that it will spend $28 million to build an off-machine coater and replace an existing coater at the company's printing papers mill. 
Potlatch also said it plans to spend $17.5 million to build a new caustic plant, which is part of the chemical recovery process in pulp manufacturing. 
The machine and plant are scheduled for completion in 1989.
