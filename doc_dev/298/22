   Potlatch Corp. said its directors authorized a $21.3 million plant changeover that will allow the company to manufacture multi-ply paperboard beginning in mid-1990. 

   The forest-products concern said one of two single-ply paperboard machines at its Lewiston, Idaho plant will be modified to produce multi-ply product, which the company believes holds promise as a growing market in the future. 
Paperboard is the kind of paper used to make milk containers.
