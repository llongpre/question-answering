   The Food and Drug Administration and the
nation's paper industry say cancer-causing dioxins in milk cartons
are being reduced to a virtually untraceable level.
   ``We expect ... that dioxin contamination of paper milk cartons
will be effectively eliminated in the very near future,'' James S.
Benson, the FDA's acting deputy administrator, told a House panel
Friday.
   ``They haven't finished the job, but they're definitely moving in
that direction.''
   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the
environment was told that only one of the six U.S. paper mills that
make the cartons _ the Potlatch Corp. mill at Lewiston, Idaho _ is
still making polyethylene-coated cardboard with traces of dioxin
high enough to measurably contaminate milk.
   Dioxin is the most potent carcinogenic chemical compound ever
tested in laboratory animals, although it has never been shown to
cause cancer in humans.
   Red Cavaney, president of the American Paper Institute, said
Potlatch had reduced the dioxin level of its milk cartons by 46
percent in the last year and that the five other plants had cut it
by as much as 90 percent.
   The FDA reported last week that tests indicated that dioxin had
leached into milk from four of 15 sampled half-pint cartons produced
by the six mills.
   Benson estimated the risk of getting cancer from drinking milk
from dioxin-contaminated milk cartons over a lifetime at less than 5
in 1 million.
   Subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said he wouldn't
be satisfied until all avoidable dioxin had been eliminated from
milk cartons as well as a wide variety of other paper products,
including disposable diapers, toilet paper, coffee filters, tea bags
and TV dinners.
   ``There is continuing scientific disagreement over some
characteristics of the dioxin risk, but no one believes that
avoidable exposure to dioxin is acceptable,'' Waxman said.
   Benson said the FDA had not completed its studies into the
possible migration of dioxin traces from other paper products into
food.
   ``We believe the manufacturing changes now in progress will
reduce, if not eliminate, this source of these compounds in food,''
he said. ``We thought milk was the most important, so that's why we
started there.''
   Dioxin makes its way into paper products through chlorine
bleaching to whiten and strengthen the material.
   Dixon has never been shown to have caused cancer in humans, but
the animal studies have raised concerns among scientists. In high
doses, dioxin has been proved to cause acne and some studies have
suggested it can also contribute to reproductive disorders.
   Cavaney said laboratory tests of milk carton samples taken from
the six mills in early summer showed only the Potlatch plant's board
had a dioxin level above the measurable threshold of 2 parts per
trillion.
   The plant, he said, is in the midst of a $145 million improvement
program to reduce the dioxin traces to well below the threshold by
the end of 1990.
   Samples from International Paper Co.'s plant at Texarkana, Texas,
measured at 2 ppt, Cavaney said, adding that the changes being made
in its production methods will reduce the dioxin content of its
paper milk cartons to below the threshold by the end of this year.
   Cavaney said the four mills producing 75 percent of the nation's
paper cartons with dioxin contents too low to cause any measurable
contamination are: International Paper at Pine Bluff, Ark.; a
Weyerhaeuser Co. facility at Longview, Wash.; Champion International
Corp.'s Canton, N.C., plant; and Westvaco Corp.'s plant at
Covington, Va.
