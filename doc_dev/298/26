Potlatch Corp.: The San Francisco-based manufacturer of forest products 
reported first-quarter earnings of $36 million, a gain of 35% over a year ago. 
Sales grew 15% to $297 million. The firm attributed the results to continuing 
strong market for pulp-based products. However, it did note that second-quarter
