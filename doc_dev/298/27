   Pope &amp; Talbot Inc. said it paid Potlatch Corp. $24 million for a Ransom, Pa., paper tissue mill that will increase its tissue capacity by 50%. 

   The forest products concern's tissue production is exclusively for private-label customers, who put their house brand on the company's products. 

   Peter T. Pope, chairman and chief executive officer of Pope, recently said the company intends to seek growth opportunities in the private-label market for tissue and diapers, where "we feel there is a niche position for a small company like us." 

   Potlatch, a forest-products concern based in San Francisco, said the mill no longer fitted its long-term operating strategy.
