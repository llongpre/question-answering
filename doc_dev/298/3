   Potlatch Corp.'s earnings slump slowed, as improved
wood-products and paper operations held the decline in
third-quarter net income to 26%.
   Potlatch, San Francisco, said it earned $18.2 million, or
63 cents a share, compared with $24.7 million, or 85 cents a
share. Sales rose slightly to $322.9 million from $314.3
million.

   The wood-products industry is mired in a deep recession,
due mainly to the weak housing market and weak prices and
overcapacity in other segments. In the second quarter,
Potlatch's earnings sank 64% on a 1.5% drop in total sales.
   Richard B. Madden, Potlatch's chairman and chief executive
officer, said earnings benefited from a turnaround at the
wood-products group, which reported earnings of $14 million,
compared with a year-ago loss of $1.5 million, on the
strength of new capacity, improved operating efficiencies,
and lower labor costs. The paper division's earnings rose 19%
to $8.2 million, because of a mill shutdown a year ago.
   He noted, however, that paper and pulp markets remain
deeply depressed. Pulp-based businesses other than paper
reported third-quarter earnings of $16.6 million, down 60%
from $41.6 million last year.
   For the nine months, Potlatch reported net income of $39.6
million, or $1.37 a share, down 58% from $94.1 million, or
$3.25 a share. Sales fell to $933.1 million from $962.2
million.
