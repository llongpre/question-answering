<TEXT>     Neither company is commenting.;    International Paper closed at $62.88, up
38 cents a share.;    "The takeover of PCH by IP remains a speculation," Saul
Yaari of Piper Jaffray investments in New York wrote in a report to clients.
He did note in the report that "the two companies would create a very
compelling business combination.";    Yaari said that any takeover by IP
wouldn't be hostile.;    But there is one stumbling block to such a deal --
antitrust action. IP controls 21 percent of the bleached board market and
Potlatch controls 11 percent, said Bob Schneider, an analyst with Cleary Gull
&amp; Reiland in Milwaukee.  </TEXT>
