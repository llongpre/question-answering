Potlatch Corp.: The maker of forest products posted second-quarter net income 
of $32.3 million, up 25% from the 1989 period.

Sales rose 8% to $321.2 million. The San Francisco-based company said the 
improvement reflected a rescheduling of annual maintenance shutdowns at two of 
its pulp-based operations from the first half to the second half of the year. 
The results also included non-recurring expenses totaling $3.8 million related 
to the redemption of certain subordinated debentures.
