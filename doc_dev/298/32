   The North American paper and forest-products industry will
report dismal results for the fourth quarter, but there are
signs the industry is at or near the bottom of its longest
downturn in decades, analysts said.
   Most Canadian paper and forest-products companies will cap
a miserable year by reporting big fourth-quarter losses,
analysts said. And while many of the Canadian companies will
continue losing money at least through the first half of
1992, results should begin to improve after that.

   In the U.S., where the downturn is less severe than in
Canada, analysts said the U.S. paper and forest-products
industry could begin reporting year-to-year earnings
increases starting with the current first quarter. However,
while analysts expect 1992 earnings to increase over the
depressed 1991 levels, results for 1992 will still be well
below 1990 earnings.
   Mark S. Rogers, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said
he expects U.S. paper and forest-products companies as a
group to report a 41% drop in fourth-quarter net from a year
earlier. Mr. Rogers also said fourth-quarter results will be
down from the third quarter, marking the 11th consecutive
quarterly earnings drop for the group. The previous record
was seven consecutive quarterly declines, a mark set in
several earlier downturns, including the 1981-82 recesssion.
   Mr. Rogers said that, for 1992, he expects U.S. paper and
forest-products concerns as a group to report a 51% earnings
increase over 1991, but adds that 1992 earnings will be 50%
below 1990 levels.
   Mark X. Diverio, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
said that results for the fourth quarter "won't be a pretty
sight." Mr. Diverio said that, as a group, the U.S. paper and
forest-products companies he follows will show a
fourth-quarter earnings decline of 50% from a year earlier.
However, based in part on Shearson Lehman's fairly optimistic
outlook for the overall economy, Mr. Diverio said that in the
first quarter he expects that the year-to-year earnings
decline will shrink to 11% to 12%, and that the group will
report higher earnings for the second quarter compared with a
year earlier.
   Sherman Chao, a Salomon Brothers analyst, is less bullish.
"We're still groping for the bottom," he said.
   For the fourth quarter "the actual numbers themselves
won't be important," Mr. Chao said. "What will be important
is what companies are saying about the underlying trends," he
said. He added that he believes the companies' reports will
be less upbeat about their prospects for 1992 than is now
expected.
   Mr. Diverio said he expects Kimberly Clark Corp. and
Chesapeake Corp. will report earnings increases and Mead
Corp. will report flat earnings for the fourth quarter. He
expects the other U.S. concerns he follows, such as
International Paper co. and Union Camp Corp. to report lower
earnings for the fourth quarter.
   Stone Container Corp., Georgia-Pacific Corp., Boise
Cascade Corp. and Champion International Corp. will report
fourth-quarter losses while Bowater should break even, Mr.
Diverio said. Stone Container and Boise Cascade have already
warned that they expect to report losses.
   Mr. Chao said he expects Kimberly-Clark, Louisiana-Pacific
Corp., Potlatch Corp. and possibly Mead to report earnings
increases for the fourth quarter.
   The Canadian paper and forest-products industry is
expected to report a hefty fourth-quarter loss, pushing the
loss for the country's publicly traded paper and
forest-products concerns as a group to well over one billion
Canadian dollars ($871 million) for the year. Including
closely held concerns and foreign-owned mills, the Canadian
paper and forest-products industry lost more than C$2 billion
in 1991, according to one estimate.
   Analysts said that Cascades Inc., a Quebec pulp and paper
concern, and Scott Paper Ltd., the Canadian subsidiary of
Scott Paper Co., are probably the only two major companies
that will report net income for the fourth quarter.
   Ross Hay-Roe, an analyst at Research Capital Corp. in
Vancouver, British Columbia, said that the last three months
of 1991 was "the worst quarter yet." Mr. Hay-Roe said that
for the western Canadian industry as a group the fourth
quarter probably was the bottom of the downturn. In the
lumber market "we've seen the worst and demand is going to
improve" in 1992, Mr. Hay-Roe said, adding that "pulp prices
have bottomed." The eastern Canadian industry, which is more
dependent on newsprint, probably hasn't hit bottom yet, he
said.
   John Johnson, an analyst at Richardson Greenshields of
Canada Ltd. in Toronto, said "I don't think the worst is over
for pulp and newsprint," adding that industry earnings "could
bottom this summer." John Carroll, an analyst at Loewen
Ondaatje McCutcheon &amp; Co. in Toronto, said that the bottom of
the cycle for the Canadian industry "could be as much as a
couple of quarters out."
   Canadian analysts said that lumber shows the best promise
for 1992. Pulp prices have stabilized but are still below
break-even levels for many Canadian mills. Newsprint demand
in the U.S., where most Canadian newsprint newsprint is
exported, remains soft and prices are still declining.
   Canadian companies are trimming newsprint capacity by
shutting some older, high-cost newsprint mills for good. For
example, Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. said Thursday
that it will shut down one mill and two newsprint machines at
another mill later this year. Analysts expect more mill
closures.
