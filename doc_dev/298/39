   Mead Corp. reported a 92% rise in first-quarter net income because of high volumes and strong prices for its forest products. 
Excluding a gain from the sale of a business, profit from continuing operations rose about 60%. 

   First-quarter net was $65.8 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $34.2 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Excluding a gain of $11.2 million, or 17 cents a share, from the sale of a recycled paperboard business, profit from continuing operations was $54.6 million, or 84 cents a share. 

   Sales climbed 13% to $1.09 billion from $957 million in the 1987 first quarter. 

   "We're bullish on the remainder of the year," said Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer of the Dayton, Ohio-based company. 
"Market demand is exceptionally strong," he said. 
"There are no present indications that conditions will change over the next several quarters." 

   The major contributors to the earnings gain were white paper, pulp and wood products, and paperboard and packaging, Mead said. 
However, there also were earnings gains from school and office supplies, paper distribution and computerized data services, Mead said. 
The only weak spot was in Canadian lumber operations. 

   "This was a very favorable report," said Timothy P. Burns, analyst with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, Cleveland, who said he had expected per-share net of about 92 cents for the quarter. 
"They have a strong marketplace in which announced prices have become transaction prices," he said. 
"The company is hitting on all four cylinders." 

   Mr. Burns said he is estimating that the company will earn $3.85 a share from continuing operations for all of 1988, and report net income of $4.02 a share. 
Before the release of first-quarter earnings, the consensus estimate was about $3.50 a share from continuing operations, but other analysts may raise their forecast after they've studied the report. 

   In 1987, Mead earned $216.7 million, or $3.45 a share, on sales of $4.21 billion. 
Profit from continuing operations was $218.2 million, or $3.47 a share. 
Sales for 1987 were $4.21 billion. 

   Most of the company's facilities are running at near-capacity levels, the company said. 
If demand remains strong, the company will be able to improve the product mix at its mills, Mead said. 
Improved operations will permit some increase in output, the company said, particularly in pulp and white paper.
