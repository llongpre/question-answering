   Potlatch Corp. said its first-quarter earnings fell 74% to
$9.6 million, or 33 cents a share, from $37 million, or $1.28
a share, because of a continuing slump in the timber
industry.
   Sales were $293.6 million, 10% below the year-earlier
$326.7 million. The first-quarter results were also hurt by
an early-retirement program at a sawmill in Idaho, and the
start-up of a paperboard machine in Lewiston, Idaho,
officials of San Francisco-based Potlatch said.

   Richard B. Madden, chairman and chief executive officer,
said second-quarter profit would continue to suffer from an
early-retirement program being undertaken among Potlatch
employees in Arkansas. Mr. Madden said he expected soft
market conditions to continue for paper products through the
second quarter, while there would be some improvement in the
wood products markets.
   Potlatch is a manufacturer of forest products with
timberland in Arkansas, Idaho and Minnesota.
