   NEW YORK -- Buyers returned to economically sensitive
stocks yesterday, but without enough force to move the
overall market higher.
   The rotation that has characterized market activity for
much of this year continued, as investors sold
consumer-product stocks that were favorites during the
recession and bought "deep cyclical" stocks, such as those of
paper companies and metal producers.

   "People are making gigantic bets on the economic
recovery," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at
Kidder Peabody.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 5.59 points to
3230.32. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index added 0.88 to
408.26 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose
0.20 to 225.85.
   The broader market couldn't shake the malaise, however,
that grew overnight with news of President Bush's weak
showing in the New Hampshire primary and falling stock
markets overseas. Losing stocks on the Big Board outnumbered
winning stocks, 963 to 753. Big Board volume totaled
232,900,000 shares compared with 234,280,000 on Tuesday.
   Many professionals expected stocks to drop yesterday in
the wake of Republican contender Patrick Buchanan's strong
showing in Tuesday's primary. Falling stocks in the world's
major markets didn't help. Some analysts are keeping a
nervous watch on Tokyo's stock market, where the Nikkei Index
of 225 stocks, at its lowest level of the year, is slipping
toward the psychologically sensitive 20000 level.
   Some reassurance that inflation remains under control
bolstered confidence among stock buyers, however. Before
trading began, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose
just 0.1% in January, less than the 0.3% rise widely
expected. Inflation fears helped fuel Tuesday's selloff.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan further
calmed those fears when he told a House Banking subcommittee
that inflation pressures appeared to be subsiding.
   Among paper companies, Boise Cascade added 1 3/4 to 25
1/4, International Paper rose 1 1/2 to 75 1/2 and Union Camp
rose 2 3/8 to 53 7/8. Forest product companies also rallied.
Georgia-Pacific gained 2 1/2 to 71 1/8, Weyerhaeuser rose 1
1/4 to 33 3/4 and Potlatch jumped 1 1/4 to 42 7/8. Dean
Witter repeated a "buy" rating on Potlatch.
   Among metal stocks, shares of Aluminum Co. of America
jumped 1 1/8 to 71 5/8, Amax rose 1/2 to 22, Phelps Dodge
gained 1 1/2 to 80 3/4 and Magma Copper added 3/8 to 8 3/4.
Among gold stocks, Homestake Mining added 1/4 to 16 1/8 and
Newmont Mining gained 3/4 to 46.
   Hewlett-Packard was the market star yesterday. The
computer maker's shares gained 9 1/8 to 73 1/2 after it
reported strong fiscal first-quarter profit. It earned $1.21
a share in the quarter ended Jan. 31, up from 83 cents a
share a year ago and well above analysts' expectations.
   Other computer stocks eased, however. Digital Equipment
lost 1/8 to 60 5/8, Compaq Computer slipped 1/8 to 30 3/4 and
Cray Research tumbled 1 1/8 to 41 5/8.
   Unisys plunged 1 to 10 1/2 as profit takers reaped the
benefits of the stock's recent run. Unisys topped the
most-active list on volume of more than 5.7 million shares.
   Oil drillers, the worst-performing market group over the
past year, failed to climb with other cyclical stocks.
   Parker Drilling lost 1/8 to 4 7/8 and Energy Service fell
1/8 to 1 5/8.
   Many consumer nondurable stocks trailed the market
yesterday. Nike lost 3 1/8 to 71 3/8, Liz Claiborne slipped 1
1/2 to 39 7/8, Hartmarx fell 1/8 to 7 1/4 and Limited lost 1
3/8 to 29 1/2. Paramount Communications fell 1 to 44 and
Mattel slid 3/8 to 33 3/4. Restaurant chains followed,
including Shoney's, which lost 1 1/4 to 25 1/2, and
McDonald's, which dropped 3/8 to 41.
   Drug and health care stocks continued to get hit by profit
takers. Merck retreated 1 7/8 to 144 1/8 and Critical Care
America fell 3 1/4 to 47 7/8.
   Among the banks, Citicorp rose 1/4 to 16 3/4, Bankers
Trust gained 3/8 to 62 and Chase Manhattan added 3/4 to 24
3/4.
   Bank of Boston rose 1 3/8 to 17 7/8. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette added the bank's stock to its recommended list. As a
reason for the recommendation, the securities firm cited the
bank's improved credit quality and a recovery in its core
earnings.
   Rohr Inc. dropped 2 to 18 1/8. The aircraft parts maker
said it may face a federal indictment as a result of an
ongoing government study of faulty testing by the company. As
a result, Rohr may be barred from winning future government
contracts and could face substantial fines.
   Ameriscribe rose 2 1/4 to 12 7/8 after it reported
fourth-quarter operating profit of 22 cents a share, up from
operating profit of a penny a share a year ago.
   Caesars World jumped 1 1/2 to 38 3/8. The casino company
expects to report fiscal second quarter profit of between 92
cents and 99 cents a share, up from 17 cents a share a year
ago.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 1.74
to 407.46.
