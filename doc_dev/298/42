<LEADPARA>  Stocks advanced Friday in a sluggish session as many traders took the
afternoon off before the holiday weekend.;    The Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 2,913.91, up 13.87 points for the day and 27.28 for the week. But
practically all of the day's gain seemed to come from computer-driven program
buying.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Birinyi Associates said two big buying waves lifted the Dow 12.74 points.; 
  Analysts argued that because of the thin trading and low level of selling
Friday, the gain seemed almost meaningless.;    Trading sank to 125 million
shares from 173.1 million the day before, while Big Board advances led
declines 963 to 541.;    Potlatch, the paper company, rose 3 to 45 3/4, with
very little in big blocks. From 39 3/8 on Monday, it rose on talk that
International Paper might want it. Both companies declined to comment, But
Richard B. Madden, Potlatch's chairman, said at the annual meeting it was not
for sale.;    The Pacific Stock Exchange's high-technology index rose a little
more than the Dow, but gains among the high-tech stocks were fairly thin.;   
Borland tacked on 1 1/8 to 52 1/8, Adobe Systems 1 1/4 to 49 1/4, Motorola 1
3/8 to 68 3/8 and Mentor Graphics 1 1/2 to 16 3/4. Intel rose 1/2 to 51, with
1.1 million shares changing hands, and Microsoft climbed 1/2 to 110 on 943,500
shares.;    Health-care stocks were strong gainers.;    Centocor rose 5 3/4 to
