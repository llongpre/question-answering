   Mead Corp., citing improvements in its pulp, paperboard and electronic publishing businesses, posted a 41% increase in second-quarter earnings on a 40% sales increase. 

   The paper products and electronic publishing concern said net income rose to $51.9 million, or 82 cents a share, from $36.9 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier, when results included a $900,000 loss from continuing operations. 

   Sales rose to $1.08 billion from $768.3 million a year earlier. 
Sales include the results of the distribution division of Crown Zellerbach Corp. and Ampad Corp., acquired during the second half of 1986. 

   Mead said world demand for pulp remains strong, and as a result, its mills are sold out through the end of the third quarter. 
World inventories of pulp have been 15% to 20% below normal levels for the past year, Mead said. 

   The company said its containerboard, used in shipping containers, is sold out, while coated board, used in beverage packaging and folding cartons, has been running at production capacity. 

   Mead said its beer and soft-drink packaging operations posted record earnings during the quarter, with both domestic and international operations running near capacity. 

   Mead said, however, that its distribution business margins remained lower during the quarter, particularly in fine papers. 
The company's distribution business consists of its Mead Merchants and Zellerbach Paper Co. units. 

   "The continuing improvement in operating performance has allowed Mead to participate fully in the current up-cycle in forest products," said Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer. 
"We are not projecting any loss of momentum in the outlook." 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Mead closed at $35.50 a share, up 87.5 cents. 

   For the first six months, Mead reported a 51% increase in net to $86.1 million, or $1.37 a share, from $57.2 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The year-ago net reflects a $1.4 million loss from continuing operations. 
Sales rose 40% to $2.04 billion from $1.45 billion.
