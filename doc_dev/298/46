   Weyerhaeuser Co. said Thursday its earnings fell 12 percent in
the first quarter, while another paper products, Champion
International Corp., reported a 39 percent profit decline for the
same period.
   Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, Wash., reported it earned $130.1
million, or 61 cents a share, compared with $148.1 million, or 70
cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales slipped 1.7 percent to $2.28 billion from
$2.32 billion.
   George H. Weyerhaeuser, chairman and chief executive, told the
annual shareholders meeting that the weakness in pulp and paper
products was only partially offset by better results in forest
products and other areas.
   Champion, based in Stamford, Conn., said a softer market for
paper products led to its profit decline for the quarter.
   It reported net income of $70 million, or 67 cents per share, in
the quarter ending March 31, compared to $114 million, ot $1.16 a
share, a year ago. Revenue held steady at $1.3 billion.
   The company attributed the earnings decline to softer markets
for some paper products, as well as outages while it expanded and
improved several mills.
   Andrew C. Sigler, Champion's chairman and chief executive
officer, called the earnings disappointing but said in a statement
that business was ``reasonably good.''
   ``We are right in the thick of our capital program to reduce
costs and increase productivity,'' he said. ``We're paying for it
now because of the many outages, but we're already seeing positive
results. The full returns will come in over the course of the next
several years.''
   Net sales from Champion's paper operations were $1.02 billion,
up slightly, while income was $149.6 million, down from $211.6
million in the first quarter of 1989.
   Champion said income from its packaging operations was even with
last year, although results were down in other segments, including
domestic printing and writing papers, publication-grade paper, pulp
operations in the U.S. and Canada, and newsprint operations.
   Net sales for wood products were also down, from $273 million to
$262 million. Income was down from $23 million to $20 million.
