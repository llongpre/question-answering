   Boise Cascade Corp. said Monday its second-quarter profit rose
4.3 percent, while another wood products company, Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp., said its eranings rose 5.7 percent for the period.
   Boise Cascade, based in Boise, Idaho, said its second quarter
earnings totaled $75.3 million, or $1.68 a share, up from $72.2
million, or $1.59 a share, during the same April-June period a year
ago.
   Second-quarter sales rose 8.3 percent to $1.09 billion from $1.01
billion a year earlier.
   For the first half of 1989, Boise Cascade earned $153.5 million,
or $3.42 a share, up from $140.7 million, or $3.06 a share, a year
earlier. First-half sales rose 8.3 percent to $2.19 billion from
$2.02 biliopn a year earlier.
   Chairman John Fery said an 18 percent increase in sales volume in
the office products segment coupled with the strongest performance
of the building products sector in two years offset a decline in
income from Boise Cascade's dominate paper products segment.
   Paper products, which account for 60 percent of the company's
sales, suffered during the spring from softness in the newsprint
market, higher wood chip costs in the Pacific Northwest and
maintenance downtime at several mills, Fery said. A gain from the
sale of the company's Specialty Paperboard Division was offset by
signing bonuses included in labor contract settlements at mills in
Alabama and Minnesota.
   Great Northern Nekoosa, based in Norwalk, Conn., said it earned
$90.2 million, or $1.63 a share, in the second quarter, up from
$85.3 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $988.4 million, up 15.3 percent from $856.9
million a year earlier.
   For the first six months, net income rose to $183.5 million, or
$3.32 a share, up from $163.6 million, or $2.98 a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales for the first six months rose to $1.97 billion from $1.70
billion.
