   Potlatch Corp., citing continued strong markets for pulp products and production efficiencies, said third-quarter net income climbed 25% on an 11% increase in sales. 

   The San Francisco forest-products concern said net rose to $28.3 million, or $1.02 a share, from the year-earlier $22.6 million, or 81 cents. 

   Sales climbed to $273.7 million from $246.8 million. 

   Potlatch said its printing paper and pulp-products operations enjoyed solid gains from ongoing strong markets, but operating profit fell sharply in its wood-products operations. 

   In the first nine months, earnings rose 27% to $79.3 million, or $2.85 a share, from $62.7 million, or $2.23 a share. 
Sales rose 8% to $798.7 million from $739.4 million. 

   Potlatch stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $30.75 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
