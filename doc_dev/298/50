   State and federal officials filed a lawsuit
Monday against eight firms that allegedly dumped cancer-causing DDT
and PCB along the Southern California coast since the 1950s.
   The unprecedented suit, filed in U.S. District Court, is an
attempt to enforce federal provisions requiring polluting companies
to restore damaged marine environments, State Controller Gray Davis
said.
   Damages are estimated to range from $50 to $100 million, said
Michael R. Valentine, an attorney for the state Lands Commission.
   ``Cease and desist orders are no longer enough. Mere cleanup
will no longer be enough. Polluters must now restore the marine
life and habitat they have contaminated,'' Davis said at a news
conference in his Los Angeles office.
   State and federal governments agencies claim the toxic dumping
and discharges have caused serious damage to reproductive health of
the bald eagle, peregrine falcon and sea lion. Recreational and
commercial fisheries have also been harmed, the suit claims.
   ``In the past, the state recovered funds for cleanup of ocean
dumping but there's never been an attempt to collect money to
restore the marine habitat,'' Valentine said.
   The targets of the lawsuit were Montrose Chemical Corp., Atkemix
37 Inc., Stauffer Management Co., ICI American Holdings, Inc.,
Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Potlatch
Corp. and Simpson Paper Co.
   ``I have no knowledge on this suit,'' said Maureen Frisch, a
spokeswoman at Simpson's headquarters in San Francisco.
   Unidentified officials at Potlatch in Pomona referred calls to
their San Francisco headquarters where no one was available in a
call made after business hours.
   Officials for the other firms named in the suit could not be
reached in calls made to the East Coast after business hours.
   The suit was filed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, a federal agency that oversees research services
that monitor the nation's atmosphere and seas.
   The suit seeks restoration of offshore environments along an
approximately 20-mile stretch of coast from the northern tip Santa
Monica Bay south to Palos Verdes.
   The action alleges the companies discharged DDT, polychlorinated
biphenyls and other toxic chemicals into the Southern California
coastal marine environment during the last 40 years.
   The insecticide DDT and the PCBs, used in electrical
transformers, are associated with skin diseases and genetic
abnormalities, including diminished reproduction capacity.
   The NOAA is joined by the state Lands Commission, Department of
Fish and Game and the Department of Parks and Recreation.
   The complaint cites the companies for natural resource damages
under a provision in the 1980 Superfund law. Under this law, the
government must first conduct a study to assess the full extent of
environmental damage before they can present their case in court.
   ``There are regulations set up by the NOAA to come up with these
dollar figures. We have set up a combined agency task force to
assess those damages,'' Valentine said.
   Under the Reagan administration, the Superfund law was
restricted to ``human health concerns'' and officials were barred
from invoking it in resource-damage cases.
   The Bush administration has restored $2.5 million cut from the
budget during the Reagan administration to pursue litigation that
would force polluters to restore land and wildlife.
   ``We all pay when the environment is damaged. We should all be
likewise concerned in trying to restore the national marine
habitat,'' Davis said.
