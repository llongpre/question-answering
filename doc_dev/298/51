   MONTVALE, N.J. -- Federal Paper Board Inc. should report
earnings for the fiscal second quarter "consistent with
analysts' projections" of 50 to 55 cents a share, reflecting
the continued industry slump, said John R. Kennedy, president
and chief excecutive officer.
   That's roughly 35% below the year-earlier 81 cents a
share, when the pulp and paper maker posted net income of
$34.6 million, on sales of $317.2 million. Based on Federal
Paper's current 40.4 million shares outstanding, net for the
quarter ended June 15 is estimated at between $20.2 million
and $22.2 million. Sales were $346.2 million. The estimated
results also are down from the first quarter, when net income
was $27.9 million, or 65 cents a share, on sales of $331.8
million. The first quarter included a gain of seven cents a
share on the sale of mechanical packaging operations.

   Mr. Kennedy, in an interview, also said he is
"comfortable" with analysts' estimates of $2.38 to $2.50 a
share for the full year, or total earnings of $96.2 million
to $101 million. For 1990, Federal Paper reported earnings of
$118.2 million, or $2.74 a share, on sales of $1.37 billion.
   Federal Paper Board, like many other paper and pulp
producers, is still suffering from the price slump that has
occurred over the last 18 months. Pulp accounts for roughly a
quarter of its sales. For example, Mr. Kennedy said Federal's
pulp mills currently get about $400 per ton, down from $600
two years ago. Furthermore, start-ups of new pulp machines in
the last year have brought "much new capacity" to the
industry, which will "continue to be absorbed this year and
next," Mr. Kennedy said, curbing any quick price recovery.
   Besides making pulp for the open market, Federal Paper
supplies pulp to its own bleached paperboard operations. It
also has a large paper-cup and recycled paperboard business,
and a wood-products business.
   Full-year results, but not second-quarter results, should
reflect a gain on the sale of several folding-carton
operations completed last month. But Mr. Kennedy said the
gain will be "less than anticipated" because "we took back a
substantial note" in selling the three folding-carton plants
to a management group. Terms of the sale weren't disclosed,
and Mr. Kennedy didn't specify the size of the note.
   Paperboard, on the other hand, accounting for roughly half
of sales, has maintained firm pricing, and the company just
increased per-ton prices about $40 to $50 last month.
Industry prices for paperboard range from about $850 a ton
for basic board to $1,100 to $1,200 for cut and converted
board for packaging food and consumer products, traditionally
noncyclical industries.
   Capital spending should be about $225 million to $250
million this year and next, compared with 1990's level of
$500 million, Mr. Kennedy said. As a result of the
muchreduced capital spending, Federal Paper's debt level
should gradually shrink from a current 55% of total capital
to the 40%-45% range. Mr. Kennedy said the company now has
consistent investment-grade ratings for its debt, after
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. raised its rating last year, and in
the last few months has been borrowing in the short-term
credit market to take advantage of lower rates.
