   Three forest products companies reported solid profit gains for the fourth quarter. 

   Boise Cascade Corp. reported a gain of 78% for the quarter. 
Champion International Corp. posted a 27% gain. 
Both noted strong results in paper products. 
Union Camp Corp. reported a gain of 37%. 

   Boise Cascade said strong markets for paper and paper products and a cost-cutting program played a major role in its 78% earnings jump. 

   The Boise, Idaho-based company reported fourth-quarter net income of $57.2 million, or $1.20 a share, a sharp increase over the year-earlier period's $32 million, or 62 cents a share. 
Year-ago per-share figures have been restated to reflect a 5-for-3 stock split paid in January 1988. 
Boise's year-ago period earnings were damaged by a $9 million pretax charge for certain moving expenses, as well as a $9.5 million pretax charge to cover loss of investment tax credits. 

   Sales in the latest period were $975.7 million, up 2.5% from $952.1 million; the company noted that a number of operations were sold during the year. 

   For the year, net was $183 million, or $3.70 a share, up 80% from last year's $101.5 million, or 1.99 a share. 
The prior year's results show the effect of a damaging and prolonged strike that ended in the third quarter, as well as the fourth-quarter charges. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boise Cascade shares closed at $38.50, up $1. 

   Champion International, Stamford, Conn., said fourth-quarter net rose 27%, buoyed by sharply increased earnings in its paper business. 
The quarterly profit was $82.1 million, or 86 cents a share, up from $64.5 million, or 69 cents a share. 

   Sales rose 9.4% to $1.16 billion from $1.06 billion. 

   The company said it is optimistic about 1988 results, in part because it expects only modest increases in papermaking capacity industrywide. 
Chairman Andrew C. Sigler also noted that the firm "anticipates price increases on almost every grade (of paper) during this quarter." 

   Champion International's 1987 net, buoyed by some one-time gains on asset sales, rose 90% to $382.0 million, or $4.03 a share, from $200.8 million, or $2.08 a share. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Champion International shares closed at $31.375, up 25 cents. 

   Union Camp, Wayne, N.J., said its quarterly profit climbed 37% to $58.9 million, or 81 cents a share, from the year-earlier $42.9 million, or 58 cents a share. 
Sales were up 14% to $609.8 million from $534.9 million. 

   Gene Cartledge, Union Camp's chief executive officer, said that "given even modest economic growth, we should see significant sales and earnings gains" in 1988. 

   Union Camp said full-year 1987 profit rose 60% to $207.5 million, or $2.83 a share, from $129.9 million, or $1.77 a share. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Union Camp shares closed at $31.75 a share, down 50 cents.
