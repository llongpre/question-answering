   Georgia-Pacific Corp. reported a 33% surge in first-quarter net income on a 14% increase in sales. 

   The first-quarter profit, which was in line with securities analysts' expectations, was a record $106 million, up from $80 million a year earlier. 
Per-share net was $1.02, compared with 71 cents a year earlier. 
Sales rose to $2.12 billion, from $1.86 billion. 

   Operating profit rose 41% for Georgia-Pacific's pulp and paper business to $116 million before taxes, interest expense and corporate overhead. 
"Timely investments in new capacity and steady improvement in manufacturing efficiency have enabled us to capitalize on the current healthy markets for products such as linerboard, pulp and uncoated free-sheet paper," said T. Marshall Hahn Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. 

   But operating profit fell 9%, to $108 million, for building materials, in part because bad weather hurt housing starts. 
Export markets for wood products continue to improve, the forest products concern said. 

   The company said it repurchased 3.1 million common shares during the first quarter, reducing shares outstanding to 101.6 million. 
The first-quarter per-share earnings were calculated on a weighted average of 104.1 million shares, down from 107.5 million a year earlier.
