   Boise Cascade Corp. Monday reported all-time
quarterly records for profits, sales and earnings per share.
   During the first three months of 1989, the Boise-based wood
products company said after-tax income rose to $78.2 million, up 14
percent from $68.5 million in the same quarter a year earlier.
Sales came to $1.1 billion in the latest quarter, up from $1
billion a year before.
   Earnings per share were $1.68 in this year's first quarter
compared to $1.44 in the corresponding 1988 quarter.
   It was the second straight quarter and the sixth in the last
seven in which new highs were posted in net income.
   ``We expect the company to have another excellent year in 1989
if the economy continues to grow at a modest rate,'' Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer John Fery said. ``Relatively strong markets
for most paper grades and for office products should largely offset
a soft market for newsprint.''
   All three of the corporation's major segments _ paper and paper
products, building products and office products _ posted increased
sales and operating income over the first quarter of 1988.
   In the paper segment, which produces over half the company's
sales, price increases for uncoated papers offset softness in the
newsprint sector and continued tight margins in the corrugated
container business as well as disruption of pulp and paper mill
operations due to severe weather in February.
   Office products posted record sales and operating income as
volume increased 17 percent over a year earlier and the corporation
maintained and increased its market share in almost every major
urban area it serves, Fery said.
   The building products segment showed only modest improvement
over a year ago, but the gain came despite the sale of three
wood-products plants that were contributing to the corporate
balance sheet during the first quarter of 1988.
   With prices for western lumber and plywood up from year-earlier
levels, Fery said, ``We expect our building products segment to do
as well as it did last year.''
