   Amfac Inc. said its management and the company's investment banker will present a restructuring plan to directors tomorrow. 

   The company has said through the year that it wants to conclude the restructuring plan, designed to "maximize earnings potential and shareholder value from all of Amfac's assets and operations," by year end. 

   In recent months, rumors that the long-awaited plan might be announced have temporarily driven Amfac shares higher, and yesterday's disclosure that the plan may be getting nearer to completion sent Amfac's stock up $2.25, to $31.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Although Amfac didn't disclose any details of the plan, some observers expect it to involve the sale or spinoff of at least a portion of its extensive Hawaiian land holdings. 
"That land isn't doing shareholders a lot of good," said Mark H. Felder, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. of Baltimore. 
"It's not generating cash." 

   Mr. Felder puts Amfac's breakup value "somewhere north of $40 a share." 
The shares briefly traded as high as $40.75 in September, but the stock has yet to recover from last month's market crash, when its price plunged to a low of $18.75. 

   Amfac has interests in wholesale distribution, food processing, retail operations, hotels and resorts and agriculture. 
For the first nine months of 1987, it had net income of $15.9 million, or 77 cents a share, on revenue of $1.60 billion. 
The earnings figure was boosted by a pretax gain of $16 million from the sale of property. 

   The conglomerate already has made efforts to streamline its operations. 
Since Ronald R. Sloan was named president and chief executive officer in May 1986, Amfac has shed a cheese company, an off-price clothing chain and its interests in five hotels. 
The company also took a $50 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter of last year to cover the planned sale of its troubled industrial and plumbing supply business. 
The company said it expects to conclude that sale by year end. 

   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. is acting as investment banker for the management plan. 
An Amfac spokesman said the board probably would want to have Salomon Brothers Inc. give it an independent evaluation of the plan prior to approval. 

   In recent weeks, two of Amfac's outside directors have resigned, citing an interest in cutting back on their obligations. 
The timing of the departures caused some speculation there might be a rift on the board, which now has eight members. 
But Potlatch Corp.'s chairman and chief executive, Richard B. Madden, said through a spokesman that his recent resignation from Amfac's board "is related strictly to his added responsibilities as president and chief operating officer," additional duties that he assumed this spring. 
And Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s retired chairman and chief executive, Frederick W. Mielke Jr., said that he had planned to leave for some time to have more time for other activities. 

   Amfac announced Tuesday that Richard L. Griffith, an executive vice president and chairman of the company's Amfac Hawaii Group, had been selected by the board's nominating committee to succeed Mr. Madden. 

   His nomination also is expected to be voted on at tomorrow's board meeting. 
Confirmation would mean that an outside director had been replaced by one from inside the company, although outside directors would still predominate.
