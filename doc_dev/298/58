   Boise Cascade Corp.'s fourth-quarter net income, helped by big profit jumps for its paper and building products segments, rose 68% to $32 million, or $1.04 a share, while sales increased just 8.5% to $969.3 million. 

   In the year-earlier period, the forest products company's net was $19 million, or 61 cents a share, on sales of $892.7 million. 

   The latest period's net would have been 33 cents a share higher except for the new tax bill's elimination of the investment tax credit, Boise Cascade said. 
A $9 million pre-tax charge for costs associated with moving a division's headquarters reduced fourth-quarter profit an additional 16 cents a share, the company added. 

   Rising prices for pulp and certain paper substantially helped profit at the company's paper segment, said John B. Fery, chairman and chief executive officer. 
Earnings from the building products segment more than doubled the year-earlier period's, helped by a "modestly" strengthening lumber market and wage rollbacks negotiated with union workers last autumn. 
Results from the packaging and office products division fell, however, partly because of eroding prices for corrugated containers. 

   For the year, Boise Cascade's net was $101.5 million, or $3.32 a share, off 2.6% from 1985's $104.3 million, or $3.45 a share. 
Sales edged up 1.4% to $3.79 billion from $3.74 billion. 
Earnings in 1986 were hurt by the increased tax rate and by a two-month strike last summer at a major pulp and paper mill. 

   Mr. Fery said he expects that further benefits from cost-cutting efforts, improving markets and increased capacity should lead to a "significantly stronger performance in 1987."
