   A brightening outlook for building materials offset dismal
pulp and paper markets in the forest-products industry,
helping Louisiana-Pacific Corp. and Potlatch Corp. to post
improved fourth-quarter performance.
   However, the persistent gloom in paper markets brought
Pope &amp; Talbot Inc., Portland, losses for both the fourth
quarter and 1991 year.

   Louisiana-Pacific reported fourth-quarter profit of $8.8
million, or 24 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
loss of $3.9 million, or 11 cents a share. Sales in the
fourth quarter rose 10% to $405.2 million, from $366.1
million.
   For the full year in 1991, Louisiana-Pacific's profit
slumped 39% to $55.9 million, or $1.55 a share, from $91.1
million, or $2.46 a share. Sales declined 5.1% to $1.70
billion, from $1.79 billion in 1990.
   Harry Merlo, Louisiana-Pacific's president and chairman,
said that the Portland company is fortunate because most of
its products are drawn from "noncontroversial timber
sources," which aren't subject to restrictions on harvesting.
Looking ahead, he added, "Even modest improvements in demand
in 1992 should translate into significant performance gains
for us."
   In San Francisco, Potlatch Corp. said fourth-quarter
profit more than tripled to $16.2 million, or 55 cents a
share, from $4.6 million, or 16 cents a share. Sales rose
4.5% to $303.9 million from $290.7 million. Wood-products
markets received a boost because restricted timber harvests
fueled speculation about future product shortages, the
company said.
   For the full year, Potlatch profit fell 43% to $55.8
million, or $1.92 a share, from $98.6 million, or $3.41 a
share. Sales fell about 1.3% to $1.237 billion, from $1.253
billion in 1990. Potlatch said its 1992 performance depends
largely on the speed and strength of economic recovery.
   Separately, Potlatch said it has decided to adopt new
accounting rules covering post-retirement benefits, resulting
in a onetime net charge of $85 million to $95 million against
earnings in 1993. The new accounting methods will have a
favorable impact on earnings, estimated at between $50
million and $60 million, partly offsetting effects of the
charge, the company added.
   Finally, weak pulp prices and low demand together with
write-offs and charges related to former paper mills brought
Pope &amp; Talbot a widening fourth-quarter loss of $8.8 million,
or 76 cents a share. That compares with a year-ago loss of
$3.3 million, or 27 cents a share. Sales fell 10% to $115.5
million from $128.7 million.
   For the full year, Pope &amp; Talbot reported a loss of $11.6
million, or $1 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit
of $19.8 million, or $1.70 a share. Sales declined 11% to
$502.3 million from $562.5 million.
