Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based forest products company, reported a
third-quarter net loss of Dollars 31.7m, or Dollars 1.19 per share, despite
a dramatic rebound in the pulp and paper markets it serves.
In the third quarter of 1993, the company had a net loss of Dollars 24.2m or
91 cents per share.
Sales in this year's third quarter were nearly unchanged from a year ago at
Dollars 1bn. Much of the loss was attributed to a Dollars 27m one-time
charge linked to the sale of the company's Canadian subsidiary, Rainy River
Forest Products, and to high debt servicing costs.
On an operating basis, Boise Cascade earned Dollars 28.4m in the quarter, up
from Dollars 5.3m in last year's third quarter. Operating income for its
paper and paper products division rose to Dollars 2.2m from a year-ago loss
of Dollars 27.8m, while income from its office products division rose to
Dollars 10.7m from Dollars 8.3m last year.
Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific said it earned Dollars 87m or 98 cents per
share in the third quarter, turning around a net loss of Dollars 36m or 42
cents per share last year. Operating profits rose to Dollars 348m in the
quarter, up from Dollars 214m.
Georgia-Pacific said its pulp-making operations returned a profit for the
first time in many quarters, earning Dollars 83m compared with a loss of
Dollars 10m a year ago.
Building products, Georgia Pacific's largest division, earned a record
Dollars 262m in the quarter, up from Dollars 210m last year. Third-quarter
sales for all divisions rose to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.0bn last year.
For the nine-month period, Georgia-Pacific earned Dollars 141m, or Dollars
1.59 per share, on sales of Dollars 9.4 bn, up from last year's Dollars 2m
or or 2 cents per share on sales of Dollars 9.1bn.
Louisiana-Pacific, the US forest products group, unveiled record
third-quarter earnings of Dollars 95.1m, or 86 cents a share, more than
double last year's Dollars 41.5m or 38 cents a share. Sales for the quarter
jumped to Dollars 818.4m from last year's Dollars 629.4m.
