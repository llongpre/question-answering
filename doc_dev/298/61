   Prices and profits in the North American paper and forest
products industry tumbled in the first quarter -- and the
second quarter will likely be even worse, analysts and
company executives say.
   Analysts expect almost all paper and forest products
concerns to report sharply lower earnings, and several
companies are expected to show a loss for the first quarter.

   "Among the bigger {Canadian} companies it will be hard to
find anybody" who made a profit, said Raymond Kilroy, an
analyst at Nesbitt Thomson Deacon, a Canadian brokerage firm.
   Overall, "Canadian companies will be in the red and U.S.
companies are approaching the red," said Sherman Chao, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers. Prices for most paper and forest
products fell during the quarter and "prices haven't bottomed
out yet," he said, adding that second-quarter earnings "will
almost certainly" be lower than first quarter earnings.
   Mark Diverio, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said
that of the 18 U.S. companies he follows, Pentair Inc. of St.
Paul, Minn., may be the only one that will report higher net
income. He estimates Pentair had first-quarter net of 45
cents a share, compared with 42 cents a share a year earlier.
   Mr. Diverio expects Kimberly-Clark Corp. of Dallas to
report that first-quarter earnings were about flat at $1.40 a
share, compared with $1.46 a share. The remaining 16
companies he tracks will all post lower earnings, Mr. Diverio
said. Overall, he expects that combined first-quarter
earnings for the entire group fell 47% from a year earlier,
excluding special items.
   Mr. Chao said that among U.S. concerns, he expects Boise
Cascade Corp., Gaylord Container Corp. and Louisiana-Pacific
Corp. will report losses for the quarter. Stone Container
Corp., Champion International Corp,. and Georgia-Pacific
Corp. may also report losses, he added.
   In Canada, said Mr. Kilroy of Nesbitt Thomson, Cascades
Inc. could be the only paper concern to report a profit.
   Paper and forest products earnings are getting squeezed by
two separate business cycles. The general economic recession
has depressed demand for newsprint, pulp, white papers,
packaging board and lumber. Meanwhile, the industry's latest
capital spending cycle is nearing an end, which means
capacity is rising as several new mills enter production. The
combined effect is heavy pressure on prices.
   Newsprint producers tried and failed to push through a 5%
price increase Jan. 1. Newsprint buyers said that transaction
prices, or actual selling prices after discounts, are now
below 1990 fourth-quarter levels. Premium northern bleached
softwood kraft pulp is selling for $650 to $675 a metric ton,
down 25% from a year earlier. Prices for other grades of pulp
are down 30% to 35% from year-earlier levels. A metric ton
equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   A further drag on the Canadian industry's profits is the
continuing strength of the Canadian dollar. Canadian mills
supply about 60% of the newsprint consumed in the U.S., and
produce much of the world's northern softwood pulp.
   Lumber prices firmed up somewhat in the quarter, but are
still below year-earlier levels. Shearson's Mr. Diverio said
he expects "a terrible {first-quarter} performance out of
wood products." Lumber is an important product for producers
in the Western U.S. and Canada.
   Prices for the various grades of packaging board and
printing and writing papers, key products for U.S. producers,
mostly dropped during the quarter.
   Prices for uncoated free sheet paper fell "into a black
hole" said George Adler, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham. Prices for the product, used for such things as
photocopying and computer printouts, dropped 5% in January
and then fell an additional 5% to 10% later in the quarter.
   Prices for most grades of containerboard, linerboard and
corrugating medium, which are used to make packaging, are
also down. However, prices and demand for bleached board, a
white carton used for the outer layer of packaging, remain
firm, one of the only bright spots for the industry. Bleached
board capacity hasn't increased, but is expected to rise
later this year.
   Federal Paper Board Co. "benefited from the strength of
bleached board" in the first quarter, said Thomas Cox, the
company treasurer. Wednesday, Federal Paper Board reported
fully-diluted net income of 61 cents a share, including a
seven cent a share one-time gain, compared with 84 cents a
share a year earlier.
