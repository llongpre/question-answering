   For the fourth quarter, the company had a loss of $3.9
million, or 11 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
net of $52.8 million, or $1.38 a share. Sales fell 28% to
$366 million from year-earlier sales of $506 million.
   Louisiana-Pacific said its building products business was
hurt by the "clear recession" in the home-building industry.
Eroding consumer confidence in the economy has caused people
to put off home buying, bringing less demand and lower prices
for building products, the company said. Louisiana-Pacific
said it has curtailed production at many mills. The pulp
market has also declined, the company said.
   For the year, Louisiana-Pacific's net dropped to $91.1
million, or $2.46 a share, from $192.6 million, or $5.04 a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell 11% to $1.8 billion from $2
billion.
   Boise Cascade Corp.'s fourth-quarter net fell to $4.8
million, or four cents a share, from $51.3 million, or $1.28
a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales fell to $1 billion
from $1.1 billion.
   The Boise, Idaho, company blamed weaker prices for wood
and paper, as well as the slowing economy and increased
interest expenses for the decline in profits.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, net fell to $75.3 million, or
$1.62 a share, from $267.6 million, or $6.19 a share, a year
earlier. Sales fell to $4.2 billion from $4.3 billion a year
ago.
