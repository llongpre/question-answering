   Weyerhaeuser Co. said earnings in its fourth quarter ended Dec. 27 jumped 35% on a 23% sales increase, as the dollar's decline strengthened markets for many lines. 

   The forest-products company said net income was $129.4 million, or 91 cents a share, up sharply from $96.1 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier. 
Per-share earnings reflect an increase in the company's common and common equivalent shares to 135 million from 130.3 million. 

   Sales surged to $1.78 billion from $1.45 billion, the company said, as "generally strong markets permitted full capacity production in major product lines." 

   Weyerhaeuser said sharply higher dollar prices for pulp and paper products drove margins on those products to their highest level in the decade. 
The dollar's decline also cut down on pressure from imports of some papers and certain panel products. 
Export prices for logs and lumber rose, fueled by the dollar's fall and a "housing construction boom" in Japan, the company added. 

   While pulp and paper-products markets "are continuing to strengthen," in the current quarter, and industrial and commercial wood-products markets remain firm, Weyerhaeuser said new residential construction "shows some signs of decline" in the wake of the stock market's crash and recent interest rate increases. 

   For the year, Weyerhaeuser had net income of $446.6 million, or $3.18 a share, up 61% from $276.7 million, or $1.91. 
Sales climbed 24% to a record $6.99 billion from $5.65 billion. 

   Weyerhaeuser closed at $36.125, down $1.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, in a broadly lower stock market.
