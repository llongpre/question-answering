GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US forest products group, yesterday turned in
underlying earnings of Dollars 5m, or 6 cents a share for the second quarter
ended June 30.
However, a one-time charge of Dollars 8m left the group with a net loss for
the three months of Dollars 3m or 3 cents a share on sales of Dollars
3.21bn. A year earlier, the company earned Dollars 4m or 4 cents a share on
sales of Dollars 3.05bn.
The Atlanta, Georgia-based company said its building products business had a
record second quarter, with operating profits of Dollars 202m against
Dollars 162m a year ago. The pulp and paper business, however, posted an
operating loss of Dollars 14m against profits of Dollars 26m.
Mr Pete Correll, chief executive, said earnings were hurt by prices for
structural panels and lumber, which declined from the first quarter, but he
added that prices have been relatively stable for the last few weeks.
For the first six months, the company had net income of Dollars 38m or 44
cents on sales of Dollars 6.15bn. A year earlier, one-time items contributed
to a net loss of Dollars 54m, or 63 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.88bn.
Weyerhauser, the forest products group based in the Pacific Northwest,
reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 181.5m, almost double the
Dollars 92.9m the company earned in the same quarter of 1992. Income,
however, was boosted by a one-time Dollars 36m gain from the sale of its
subsidiary, GNA Corp, writes Patrick Harverson. Although profits were higher
than a year ago, they were lower than the first quarter of this year, when
the company earned Dollars 229m, including a Dollars 44m extraordinary gain
from the sale of its nappy business.
The pricing environment continues to provide a foundation for strong
earnings, said Weyerhauser. The company has also benefited from cost and
productivity improvements. Its timberlands and wood products business earned
Dollars 241.8m in the quarter, and its pulp and paper business Dollars
44.4m. The real estate and financial services units brought in Dollars
12.2m.
The results failed to impress investors. Weyerhauser's stock fell Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based paper, office and building products company,
reported a loss for the second quarter of Dollars 17.1m, down sharply from
the Dollars 45.4m deficit recorded in the same three months of 1992 but
slightly larger than the Dollars 12.1m loss in the first quarter this year.
The result reflects a modest slowdown in sales and a sharp drop in lumber
and plywood prices, which hit the building products division. Sales totalled
Dollars 974m compared with Dollars 984m in the previous quarter.
Losses from the paper business were significantly lower thanks to higher
pulp and paper prices and a reduction in manufacturing costs.
Boise Cascade shares were little changed on the NYSE, down just Dollars  1/8
at Dollars 22 5/8.
