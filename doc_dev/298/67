   The North American paper and forest products industry is
neck deep in trouble, wondering if it will hit bottom before
its already meager profits sink completely out of sight.
   The bottom is proving elusive. A few weeks ago many
analysts were calling the second and third quarters the
bottom of the industry's down cycle. But prices for key
products such as newsprint and market pulp kept sliding in
the third quarter, killing chances of a turnaround in the
fourth quarter. As a result, analysts are busily chopping
their earnings forecasts for this year and 1992. Some U.S.
and almost all Canadian paper and forest products companies
are expected to report third-quarter losses.

   "Third-quarter earnings {for U.S. companies} will be worse
than the second quarter and the fourth quarter won't be
materially better than the third quarter," said Mark X.
Diverio, a Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst. Mr. Diverio said
he expects that as a group the 18 U.S. paper companies he
follows will report that third-quarter earnings fell 57% from
1990.
   Sherman Chao, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said that
"there's a good chance of single-digit earnings increases" in
1992 for the U.S. industry. But that is compared with the
terrible results forecast for this year, and Mr. Chao added
that he may have to cut his 1992 estimates.
   In the third quarter, demand remained soft for many
products and with only a few exceptions prices fell, analysts
said. Bleached board, used to make packaging, was one of the
few bright spots for the industry this year but it is now
showing signs of price weakness. Producers of linerboard,
another packaging grade, have a good chance of making price
increases stick, analysts said. Prices for uncoated free
sheet, used for photocopies and computer printing, have been
moving up but the "improvement may be short-lived," Mr. Chao
said.
   Prices for wood products jumped on fears of shortages in
the second quarter but then fell back starting in late June
as worries subsided about the effect of efforts to protect
the habitat of the spotted owl in the U.S. northwest. Prices
for wood products are now flat to down compared with a year
earlier. Mr. Chao said he is "reasonably optimistic" about
wood products in 1992 because housing starts should pick up.
   Prices for newsprint and northern bleached softwood kraft
pulp, the benchmark pulp grade, fell further in the third
quarter, analysts said. Spot prices for both products are now
at about $480 a metric ton, the lowest levels in years. A
metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   Big producers of pulp and newsprint such as Boise Cascade
Corp., Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Bowater Inc. are feeling the
pain. Excluding one-time items, Georgia-Pacific is expected
to report a loss of five to ten cents a share compared with
net of $1.11 a share a year earlier. Boise Cascade is
expected to report a third quarter loss of about $1.10 a
share compared with year-earlier net of 27 cents a share.
Bowater said ten days ago that it expects to report
third-quarter net income of 15 cents to 20 cents a share
compared with net of 63 cents a share a year earlier.
   Newsprint and pulp are key products for Canadian paper and
forest products concerns and Canadian producers were already
losing money before prices fell in the third quarter. Almost
every Canadian paper and forest products concern is expected
to report a loss for the third quarter. Analysts said that
excluding one-time items, Cascades Inc. may be the only
Canadian concern to report net income for the quarter.
   "This has been a deeper downturn than 1982" for Canadian
producers, said Raymond Kilroy, an analyst at Nesbitt Thomson
Deacon in Toronto. He added that the eventual turnaround
won't be as strong as after the 1982 recession. Stephen
Atkinson, an analyst at Deacon BZW Ltd. in Montreal, said
that the Canadian industry will likely shrink because higher
wood costs in Canada are squeezing producers out of the U.S.
market for good. Mr. Atkinson said that average wood costs in
eastern Canada run at about $120 a metric ton compared with
$50 a metric ton in the southern U.S. It takes about two
metric tons of wood to make one metric ton of pulp.
