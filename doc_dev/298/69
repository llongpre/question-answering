   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to buy Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co. for $530 million, in a move that would allow it to capitalize on strong demand for softwood pulp and lessen its exposure to the housing market. 

   The forest products concern, which also will assume $135 million in debt, said the transaction includes Brunswick's pulp and paper mill, one of the largest in the world, plus three sawmills and about 535,000 acres of timberland in the South. 
Brunswick is a joint venture of Mead Corp. and Scott Paper Co. 

   The acquisition surprised analysts, who noted that the Brunswick, Ga., company had been on the block for at least a year during a time when Georgia-Pacific had been looking for an acquisition. 
Several analysts believe that's the major reason Georgia-Pacific got Brunswick for a good price -- less than half the cost of building a pulp and paper mill from scratch. 
"Georgia-Pacific was smart to bide its time," said Mark S. Rogers, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research. 

   T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive officer, said he'd been interested in acquiring Brunswick for about a year. 
"We finally arrived at a price that was attractive for us," he said. 
The acquisition will add 525,000 tons a year to Georgia-Pacific's current market pulp capacity of 700,000 tons. 
He said the purchase will also enable the company to capitalize on the strong demand in the softwood pulp business, "by giving us not only a plant located in our own backyard, but also located at a port." 

   The acquisition will more than double the company's current paperboard capacity of 171,000 tons a year. 
The timberlands will supply not only the Brunswick mill, but also Georgia-Pacific's building products business. 

   Mr. Hahn said the acquisition would be financed with some combination of cash and short-term securities, but wouldn't be specific. 
At the end of March, the company had a debt-to-capital ratio of about 40%. 
Mr. Hahn said the additional borrowings could boost that figure "modestly beyond" 45%, the upper end of the company's target ratio. 

   However, he said, the company would continue its stock buy-back program until the transaction closes in about six weeks, and then "we'll have to see where we are . . ." Through the first four months of this year, the company had repurchased 6.7 million common shares in a program that would have allowed it to buy up to the 45% debt level, or about 20 million shares. 

   Analysts generally applauded the acquisition as a move that would lessen the company's exposure to the volatile housing market, and greatly expand its business in the low-priced, commodities-oriented segment of the industry -- an area in which U.S. producers have an edge in the world-wide market. 
But like commodities businesses in general, this one is subject to wide fluctuations in profitability. 
For instance, the strong dollar that is boosting export markets will one day weaken. 

   In fact, Mead, based in Dayton, Ohio, said the sale is part of its strategy to focus on more value-added products. 
For instance, it acquired a paper distributorship and an office supply business in 1986. 
Last year, it announced a $500 million expansion of its coated paperboard operations. 
Such businesses are less severely cyclical than commodities-based ones. 

   Philadelphia-based Scott Paper said it decided to sell its interest because an increasing part of Brunswick's output is aimed at the world-wide pulp market, which no longer fits Scott's fiber strategy. 
Instead, the company said it's emphasizing other sources, such as eucalyptus, which Brunswick doesn't produce. 

   Both Mead and Scott Paper said they expect to post one-time third-quarter gains of about $1.50 a share from the sale. 

   But several analysts said the Brunswick acquisition will significantly boost Georgia-Pacific's earnings this year as well. 
Lawrence Ross, analyst with PaineWebber Inc., estimated the acquisition would add more than 20 cents a share this year and as much as 40 cents to 60 cents next year. 
Last year, Georgia-Pacific had net income of about $458 million, or $4.23 a share, on sales of $8.6 billion. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Georgia-Pacific closed at $40.125 a share, up 50 cents; Mead closed at $38.25 a share, up $1.25; and Scott Paper closed at $40.625 a share, down 37.5 cents.
