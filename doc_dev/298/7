   Potlatch Corp., citing strengthening markets and the boost to exports by the declining U.S. dollar, reported that fourth-quarter net income rose more than fourfold to $20.1 million, or $1.45 a share, from the year-earlier $4.4 million, or 26 cents a share. 

   Sales rose 7% to $243.3 million from $227.4 million a year ago. 

   Per-share income reflected a decline in the average number of shares outstanding to 13.3 million from 15 million. 
Potlatch said results for the year-ago period included about $9 million in nonrecurring expenses. 

   In the latest period, operating profit from wood products increased eightfold from last year, helped by lower operating costs, strengthening demand, and a since-ended strike by Canadian lumber workers that boosted lumber prices. 
Pulp, paperboard and packaging products also showed strong earnings improvement as prices for those products continued to rise. 
However, Potlatch said operating difficulties in its printing paper group led to flat sales and lower profit at the group. 

   The company also noted that maintenance shutdowns at some mills, usually taken in the fourth quarter, were pushed back this year and will have a slight effect on operations at certain plants in the current quarter. 

   For the year, Potlatch had net income of $69.9 million, or $4.98 a share, up 86% from $37.7 million, or $2.19 a share, the previous year on more shares outstanding. 
Sales for 1986 totaled $976.4 million, up 2.7% from $950.3 million. 

   Richard B. Madden, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company's outlook for 1987 "remains optimistic."
