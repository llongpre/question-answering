   Three major paper manufacturers, Champion International
Inc., Union Camp Corp. and Bowater Inc., reported declines in
third-quarter earnings as the industry continued to struggle
with weak markets.
   The declines generally were expected. Analysts had been
warning of substantial third-quarter earnings drops in the
industry, particularly among those companies that rely more
heavily on pulp and basic paper grades, which have wider
price swings.

   Champion, hit particularly hard in the industry's
recession, has had similar earnings drops in recent quarters.
The Stamford, Conn., company's third-quarter results were
helped by a nonrecurring gain of about 12 cents a share on
the sale of some timberland.
   Sales for the quarter were off 5% to $1.23 billion, all in
Champion's paper business. Wood products sales were flat.
Operating profit for its paper segment was down sharply to
$36.1 million from $162.6 million, attributable largely to
sharply lower prices for printing and writing papers.
Packaging operations were down from a year ago, and pulp and
newsprint operations showed operating losses.
   Champion's chairman, Andrew C. Sigler, said the results
"were about what we expected, given the persistence of the
current recession." He noted that mill performance has
improved over the last year, in anticipation of an economic
rebound.
   Union Camp, of Wayne, N.J., also noted weak prices for
business paper, well below last year's levels. But Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Gene Cartledge noted that demand
had been improving through the quarter, prompting the
industry to start increasing prices. He noted that
greater-than-usual land sales and other real estate
activities added 10 cents a share to earnings. Sales were up
8.6% to $768.6 million. A Union Camp spokesman said interest
expense from various capital projects tripled in the quarter
to $22 million.
   Bowater, of Darien, Conn., had predicted last month that
earnings for its third quarter ended Sept. 28 would be down
substantially. Chairman Anthony P. Gammie noted that only its
communications paper business, which sells higher-value
products like perforated computer printout paper, managed to
increase operating earnings. Lower prices for its market pulp
and newsprint, and a general increase in inventories, hurt
results. The company also had added downtime and maintenance
costs at its mills in the quarter. Sales declined 10% to $312
million.
   Bowater earlier this month announced it had agreed to buy
several mills and related facilities in Maine from
Georgia-Pacific Corp. for about $300 million. The facilities,
which Georgia-Pacific had acquired in its takeover of Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. last year, would increase Bowater's
size by about a third. Bowater said yesterday that the
purchase would have a material effect on its financial
condition.
   In late trading on the New York Stock exchange, Champion
shares were quoted at $26.375 a share, down 12.5 cents a
share; Union Camp at $49.625, up $1; and Bowater at $23, up
25 cents.
