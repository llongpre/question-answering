   Mead Corp. is having a good year, but operating profit for the third quarter and full year will be lower than the exceptionally high earnings a year earlier, Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   Mr. Roberts estimated that the forest-products and electronic-publishing concern will earn between 80 cents and 85 cents a share from operations in the third quarter, down from $69.6 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. 

   Divestiture of a major unit last year and purchase of another business at year end that dilutes current year earnings are the primary reasons for the expected lower operating profit, he said. 
However, the company also is incurring training and marketing expenses in preparation for a major plant addition and is launching costly advertising programs to promote a new color-copying technology, he said. 

   Demand for the company's key products is good, Mr. Roberts said. 
Additional industry capacity for certain grades of paper have resulted in a slight weakening in some prices, he said, but the comparison is against strong price levels in the early months of 1989. 

   Third-quarter per-share profit will include a gain of 25 cents from sale of a small unit, Mr. Roberts said, making net income $1.05 to $1.10. 
Year-earlier net was $170.5 million, or $2.56 a share, including a gain of $100.9 million, or $1.50 a share, from Mead's sale of its 50% interest in Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co. 

   Sales for the current quarter will be about $1.2 billion, up from $1.17 billion the year earlier, Mr. Roberts said in an interview. 

   First-half net was $114.8 million, or $1.77 a share, down from $138.8 million, or $2.13 a share, a year earlier. 
However, the 1988 profit included a 17-cent-a-share gain from sale of assets, and 33 cents a share from Brunswick Pulp's operations. 
Sales for the half rose to $2.34 billion from $2.25 billion, despite the loss of Brunswick's volume. 

   Mr. Roberts said it's too early to make a good estimate of fourth-quarter results, but that operating profit for the full year is unlikely to equal the $240.8 million, or $3.70 a share, of 1988. 
Including gains on sale of assets and a charge related to a discontinued insurance business, Mead's 1988 net income was $352.7 million, or $5.37 a share. 

   Mr. Roberts said the company expects sales for the year of about $4.65 billion, compared with $4.46 billion in 1988. 

   At the end of 1988, Mead purchased Michie Co., a publisher of legal materials, for $226.5 million, which was far in excess of book value. 
The acquisition will help strengthen Mead's computerized legal-information business, Mr. Roberts said, but amortization of the difference between purchase price and book value is reducing 1989 profit. 
The company estimates that the acquisition will reduce Mead's profit 25 cents a share this year, with 16 cents of that already absorbed in the first half. 

   Sales of Mead Data Central, the company's electronic-publishing business, will exceed $400 million this year, up from last year's $307.6 million, said Jack W. Simpson, president of the unit. 
Acquisition of Michie accounted for about $35 million of that, but continuing businesses are showing a revenue rise of almost 20%, he added. 
Operating profit is rising more rapidly than revenue, he said. 

   Mead's paper group profit this year will benefit from greatly improved results at its Chillicothe, Ohio, mill, Mr. Roberts said. 
The company has made sizable investments in recent years to improve the plant's efficiency. 
Profit hadn't been satisfactory for a number of years, but is showing marked improvement this year, Mr. Roberts added. 

   However, a major plant at Escanaba, Mich., has been operating with slightly lower efficiency recently because of protracted labor negotiations, Mr. Roberts said. 
The plant has been operating without a contract since June 1. 
While there has been no work stoppage, and Mr. Roberts said he doesn't expect one, the plant hasn't been operating quite as smoothly as it did previously. 
Escanaba is one of the company's largest and most profitable facilities. 

   Mead's paperboard and packaging sales continue relatively strong, but operating profit is lower than a year ago, Mr. Roberts said. 
The company took some downtime at a containerboard plant to install new equipment, and startup has been more difficult than anticipated, he said. 
Also, the the rising dollar is reducing profits in Europe, Mr. Roberts said. 

   Mead has a sizable packaging products business in Europe, which is supplied mainly by Mead's U.S. coated paperboard mill. 
The rising dollar makes U.S.-produced material more expensive for European plants, and prices are higher for European-produced board, reducing profit margins for the European packaging business, he said. 
The company's $550 million coated paperboard expansion project at Mahrt, Ala., is proceeding on schedule and on budget, Mr. Roberts said. 
About 25% of the construction has been completed, and the plant is scheduled to start operating in the 1990 fourth quarter. 

   Training personnel to operate the plant will reduce Mead's 1989 profit 16 cents to 18 cents a share, Mr. Roberts estimated.
