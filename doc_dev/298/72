   North American paper and forest products companies ended
the second quarter singing the same sad song they've been
singing for over a year now. The chorus goes something like
this: Demand is soft, capacity is rising, prices are down,
profits are too.
   Second-quarter earnings dropped substantially from a year
earlier at almost all paper and forest products companies,
analysts said. A few U.S. companies will likely report
losses, including Boise Cascade Corp., Stone Container Corp.,
Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Champion International Corp. In
Canada, nearly every company is expected to show a loss for
the period. Quebec-based Cascades Inc. may have eked out a
slim profit, analysts said.

   The third quarter won't be much better. While there are
some signs that a long-awaited industry turnaround is near,
July is a seasonally weak month for the industry.
   The one big bright spot amid the gloom in the second
quarter was a sudden jump in lumber and plywood prices. In
late May a U.S. federal judge banned logging on 66,000 acres
of forest in the Northwest pending completion of a
conservation plan to protect the northern spotted owl. That
court decision and other owl developments, heavy rains that
reduced output in the southern U.S., and a seasonal pickup in
demand combined to push some lumber and plywood prices to new
highs. Prices have slipped somewhat since peaking in June.
   After posting losses in the first quarter, many
wood-products operations made money in the second quarter,
analysts said. "We had a reversal of fortune. Wood is good
again," said Sherman Chao, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Mr. Chao said prices for wood products averaged 20% to 25%
higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter.
   However, the spike in wood-products prices wasn't enough
to offset weak results in paper and packaging. Mark X.
Diverio, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said he
expects the 18 companies he follows to show average
second-quarter earnings declines of 55%.
   Bleached board was the only strong second-quarter
performer among the major packaging grades. Producers raised
bleached board prices 5% in June and the increase is holding
for now, analysts said. Markets and prices for other
packaging grades generally deteriorated in the quarter,
analysts said, adding that linerboard prices may have
bottomed.
   Paper markets were generally weak. "Uncoated free sheet
prices fell apart in the second quarter," Mr. Chao said.
Prices for uncoated free sheet were on average 15% lower
compared with the first quarter. In coated papers, prices for
lighter grades used for magazines trended down while prices
for heavier grades used for annual reports and brochures held
steady.
   Aided by its emphasis on bleached board, Federal Paper
Board Co. reported net income of 56 cents a share for the
fiscal second quarter ended June 15 compared with 81 cents a
share a year earlier.
   International Paper Co. reported second-quarter net of 95
cents a share compared with $1.70 a share a year earlier. It
blamed most of the earnings decline on lower prices for
uncoated papers and linerboard.
   Pope &amp; Talbot Inc. said Thursday it expects to report
second-quarter net income of about 15 cents a share compared
with 73 cents a share a year earlier, due mainly to a sharp
decline in pulp prices.
   Towards the end of the quarter producers again chopped the
list price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp by $25.
This bellwether grade now lists at $575 a metric ton, down
30% from $830 a metric ton a year ago. Transaction prices are
below $550 a metric ton, said Raymond Kilroy, an analyst at
Nesbitt Thomson Deacon in Toronto.
   Pulp inventories world-wide are at record levels and the
market still must absorb some new capacity, said John
Carroll, an analyst at Toronto-based Loewen Ondaatje
McCutcheon. "I can't see any reason for {pulp} prices to go
back up for 18 months, maybe even two years," Mr. Carroll
said.
   Newsprint isn't in much better shape. U.S. newsprint
consumption fell 11.5% in May and 8.9% in the first five
months. North American newsprint producers tried and failed
to push through a price increase in the first quarter. In the
second quarter transaction prices eroded further.
   Pulp and newsprint are crucial products for Canadian
forest-products companies. Continuing slack demand and
depressed prices for both commodities largely explains why
the Canadian forest-products industry is in even worse shape
than the U.S. industry, analysts said.
