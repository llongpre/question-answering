   Temple-Inland Inc.'s first-quarter net income more than doubled, reflecting the recovery of paper-product prices, which have languished for almost two years. 

   The Diboll, Texas-based forest products and paper concern reported net income of $33.7 million, or $1.09 a share, compared with $13.6 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales increased 33% to $390.6 million from $292.7 million. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Temple-Inland shares closed at $62.875, up $2.375. 

   "A year ago, prices for our paper products had dropped to dangerously low levels," said Clifford J. Grum, president and chief executive officer. 
"If the current momentum continues, we expect Temple-Inland to achieve record earnings in 1987." 
Analysts have estimated that Temple-Inland will report 1987 earnings from $3.40 to $4.80 a share. 

   The sharpest improvement came in Temple-Inland's container and containerboard sector, which comprises almost two-thirds of the company's sales. 
Operating earnings from the segment improved dramatically, to $31.1 million from a $500,000 loss in the year-earlier quarter. 
Sales jumped 51% to $232.8 million from $153.8 million. 
The company attributed the recovery to strong demand for linerboard and a $30-a-ton linerboard price increase during the quarter. 
Corrugated-box prices also improved, the company said, but not to the level of two years ago. 

   The company's pulp and paperboard segment also reported significant improvement, with operating earnings almost tripling, to $12.9 million from $4.4 million. 
Sales increased 15% to $73.7 million from $64.2 million. 
Improved prices, coupled with increased production and operating efficiencies, caused the gain, the company said. 

   Sales of Temple-Inland's building products rose 15% from the 1986 first quarter, to $80.5 million from $69.8 million. 
Operating profit for the sector rose 39% to $9.6 million from $6.9 million. 
The company said the sector benefited from the relative strength of new-housing construction and significant improvement in lumber and particleboard operations. 
Gypsum prices, however, continue to be depressed, the company said. 

   The company's financial-services sector reported that operating earnings increased 12% to $8.4 million from $7.5 million.
