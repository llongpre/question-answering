   James River Corp. and Federal Paper Board Inc. joined the
list of paper and paper-products makers reporting steep drops
in profit for the fourth quarter.
   James River, a big maker of tissue paper products, cited
heavy price cutting among competitors as the biggest factor
in its profit erosion. Federal Paper Board said weakened pulp
prices and downtime for some of its facilities, as well as
charges, were factors.

   James River, based in Richmond, Va., said net income
plunged 87% to $7.8 million, or two cents a share, in the
quarter, compared with $62 million, or 68 cents a share, in
the 1990 period. The recent quarter was 13 weeks, while the
1990 period was 14 weeks, the result of a 1990 change in
fiscal year to end the last Sunday in December instead of the
last Sunday in April.
   Sales were off 11% to $1.1 billion from $1.24 billion;
adjusted for the extra week in 1990, pro forma sales were off
4.3%. The results were generally in line with analysts'
estimates, a spokeswoman said.
   Federal Paper Board, Montvale, N.J., said fourth-quarter
net income plunged 75%, after several charges and as pulp
prices eroded more than $100 a ton and equipment was idled
for various reasons.
   The maker of bleached paperboard, bleached market pulp,
recycled paperboard and other products said net fell to $5.7
million, or eight cents a share, from $22.9 million, or 52
cents a share, a year ago. Sales fell 6.6%, to $411 million.
   The latest quarter had $9.8 million in charges, compared
with $11 million a year ago.
   John R. Kennedy, president, said business was hurt by the
generally poor economy. The fourth-quarter non-operating
charges and the reduced earnings because of machine downtime
are behind the company, he said.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, James River
fell 50 cents to $21.875, and Federal Paper rose 62.5 cents
to $29.75.
