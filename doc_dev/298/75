   Weyerhaeuser Co., citing strengthening markets and gains in productivity, reported that net income for the third quarter more than doubled from the year-earlier period's strike-blunted earnings, on revenue that rose 30%. 

   The forest products concern also boosted its quarterly dividend 15% to 37.5 cents from 32.5 cents. 
The dividend is payable Nov. 30 to stock of record Oct. 30. 

   Weyerhaeuser said net income rose to $126.1 million, or 89 cents a share, from $62.2 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier, when net reflected the effect of a lengthy lumber worker strike. 

   Revenue rose to a third-quarter record of $1.82 billion from $1.4 billion a year earlier. 

   Weyerhaeuser credited continued strength in the markets for pulp, paperboard and newsprint, as well as increased demand and prices for logs to be exported, much of it to construct housing in Japan. 
"The pulp and paper mills are pretty much running flat out" in the current market, said a spokesman. 

   The company said a prolonged drought in the Pacific Northwest this summer has curtailed logging operations, which has softened sales. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Weyerhaeuser closed at $50.50 a share, up 25 cents. 

   For the nine months, Weyerhaeuser's net rose 76% to $317.2 million, or $2.27 a share, from the year-earlier $180.6 million, or $1.21 a share. 
Average common shares outstanding rose to 134.7 million from 130.2 million. 
Sales rose 24% to $5.21 billion from $4.2 billion.
