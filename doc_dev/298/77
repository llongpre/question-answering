   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., the target
of a hostile takeover offer, reported a 39 percent drop in net
income in the fourth quarter partly because of the cost of fending
off the bid.
   Net income was $52 million, or 92 cents a share, compared to
$85.8 million, or $1.56 a share, in the last quarter of 1988, Great
Northern said Tuesday.
   The Norwalk-based paper company said its earnings per share were
reduced by 33 cents because of the $3.8 billion offer made late
last year by Georgia-Pacific Corp., a forest products company in
Atlanta.
   Great Northern is fighting Georgia-Pacific using anti-takeover
provisions in its bylaws and an antitrust suit in Connecticut.
   Chairman William R. Laidig also attributed the decline to a
general downturn in the paper industry due to overcapacity.
   ``Business conditions changed around mid-year, when increasing
paper capacity began to affect the supply-demand balance in many of
our markets,'' he said. ``Generally, prices for most of our
products had been relatively stable the first half of the year, but
weakened modestly in the third quarter and continued to weaken in
the fourth.''
   Great Northern said fourth-quarter sales fell 1 percent to $934
million from $944.1 million a year earlier. Shipments of pulp,
paper and containerboard from the company's mills fell 27.7 percent
in the fourth quarter because of harsh weather at the company's
southern mills.
   Net income for the year fell 6 percent to $321 million, or $5.78
a share, from $341.7 million, or $6.21 a share in 1988. Sales rose
8 percent to $3.9 billion from $3.6 billion in 1988.
   ``The outlook is a tough call because most of our markets are
becoming more competitive,'' Laidig said. ``Our performance in 1990
will depend on the strength of the U.S. economy and the growth in
demand for our products.''
