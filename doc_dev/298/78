   Mead Corp., bolstered by high volumes and strong prices for its forest products, reported that second-quarter net income climbed 41% to $73 million, or $1.12 a share. 

   In the year-ago period, Mead had net of $51.9 million, or 82 cents a share. 

   Sales for the second quarter, ended July 3, rose 8% to $1.16 billion from $1.08 billion. 

   "Demand for our products continues strong across the board, and we see every indication that the present strong environment will be with us through 1988 and into 1989," said Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer of the forest products and electronic publishing company. 

   Mead's publishing paper division, which makes coated papers for use in magazines, catalogs and advertising inserts, led the second-quarter earnings gain, the company said. 
However, there were also earnings improvements from coated board, container board, pulp, school supplies and the electronic publishing businesses. 
"New orders for all these businesses continue to climb, and prices for the company's products have strengthened," Mr. Roberts said. 

   For the first six months, Mead reported that net increased 62% to $138.8 million, or $2.13 a share, from $86.1 million, or $1.37 a share. 
Sales for the period advanced 11% to $2.25 billion from $2.04 billion.
