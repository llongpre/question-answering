   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said second quarter earnings fell 20% from a year earlier, but on an operating basis the company turned in a sound performance. 

   The forest-product concern posted a profit drop to $118 million, or $1.21 a share, from $148 million, or $1.35 a share, but the 1987 quarter included a net gain of $37 million from the sale of the company's interest in Georgia Gulf Corp. Sales rose 15% to $2.42 billion from $2.09 billion. 

   The results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, were led by the pulp and paper business. 
It continued to churn out record earnings, with operating profit rising to $133 million from $88 million a year earlier. 
Both domestic and foreign demand for pulp, liner board, cardboard boxes and uncoated freesheet paper were strong, according to the company, which expects the business to remain strong in the second half. 

   In the building-material segment, operating profit fell 16% to $120 million from $144 million as interest rates kept housing starts in the doldrums. 
However, George B. Adler, an analyst with Smith, Barney, Harris, Upman &amp; Co., said this segment could pick up in the third quarter if lumber strikes in the Pacific Northwest persist. 

   In the first six months, earnings were $224 million, or $2.22 a share, compared with $228 million, or $2.06 a share, a year earlier. 
Per-share earnings rose, despite the profit drop, because of fewer shares outstanding. 
Sales rose to $4.53 billion from $3.95 billion. 

   The company also said it bought back 5.5 million common shares in the second quarter for $219 million, reducing its shares outstanding to 96.5 million.
