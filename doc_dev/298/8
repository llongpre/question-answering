   Pacific Northwest forest products companies posted sharp third-quarter earnings gains, bolstered by strong wood product markets, improving markets for pulp and paper, and a calmer labor picture. 

   Boise Cascade Corp. said its third-quarter profit more than tripled to $50.4 million, or $1.70 a share, from the year-earlier's profit of $13.2 million, or 38 cents a share, when a strike at its Rumford, Maine, paper mill depressed earnings. 
Revenue rose 6% to $997 million from $943 million last year. 

   For the nine months, the Boise, Idaho-based company's profit jumped 81% to $125.8 million, or $4.17 a share, from $69.6 million, or $2.28 a share, in the year-earlier period. 
Revenue remained flat at $2.8 billion. 

   John B. Fery, chairman and chief executive officer, said Boise Cascade expects continued strong performance through 1987 into 1988. 
Building products, already feeling the effects of lower plywood prices, may experience some downturn resulting from the expected decline in new housing starts, he said. 
But the trend should be offset, in part, by healthy repair and remodeling markets, he said. 

   San Francisco-based Potlatch Corp. posted a 35% gain in third-quarter net to $22.6 million, or 81 cents a share, from $16.7 million, or 59 cents a share. 
Revenue declined 1.3% to $246.8 million from $250 million. 

   For the nine months, Potlatch said profit rose 26% to $62.7 million, or $2.23 a share, from $49.8 million, or $1.77 a share, in the year-earlier period. 
Revenue rose less than 1% to $739.4 million from $733.1 million. 

   In Portland, Ore., Pope &amp; Talbot Inc. reported net of $7.1 million, or 59 cents a share, up 65% from the $4.3 million, or 36 cents a share, in last year's third quarter. 
Year-ago per-share earnings reflect a 2for-1 stock split effective last May. 

   Third-quarter revenue rose 45% to $113.5 million from last year's $78.1 million. 

   For the nine months, Pope &amp; Talbot posted profit of $21 million, or $1.74 a share, more than double last year's $7.4 million, or 62 cents a share. 
Revenue for the nine months increased 40% to $320.1 million from $228.3 million a year ago. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boise Cascade's shares closed at $79.25, down $1.75; Potlatch's stock closed unchanged at $33.375; and Pope &amp; Talbot's shares closed at $21.625, up 62.5 cents.
