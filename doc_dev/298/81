   Mead Corp. is experiencing strong demand for most forest products and continued growth in electronic publishing, which will result in higher 1988 profit, Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   Mr. Roberts declined to make a specific earnings forecast, but he said management is comfortable with analyst estimates for 1988 "in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 a share," excluding gains on asset sales. 

   Those estimates assume fourth-quarter profit of 63 cents to 73 cents a share, all from continuing operations. 
That would compare with year-ago earnings from continuing operations of $34.7 million, or 55 cents a share, and net income of $33.2 million, or 53 cents a share. 

   The estimates indicate net income for 1988 of $5.32 to $5.42 a share, after adding a $1.67-a-share gain from sale of assets in the first nine months. 
In 1987, earnings from continuing operations were $218.2 million, or $3.47 a share. 
Net income was $216.7 million, or $3.45 a share. 

   All earnings per share are on a fully diluted basis, as the company regularly reports profit. 

   Sales for 1988 will be about $4.5 billion despite the sale of two businesses during the year, up from $4.21 billion in 1987, Mr. Roberts said in an interview. 

   Results in the 1988 fourth quarter will be noticeably affected by the sale in August of the company's 50% interest in Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co., Mr. Roberts said. 
That forest-products business was contributing profit at an annual rate of 60 cents to 65 cents a Mead share, he said. 

   As a result of the Brunswick sale, analyst estimates that Mead will earn $3.80 to $4 a share in 1989 could be high, Mr. Roberts said. 
He said profit in that range "is possible, but an awful lot of things would have to go right." 
Brunswick contributed 40 cents to 45 cents a share to operating profit in the nearly eight months Mead owned it this year, officials said. 

   Mead's businesses are faring well, Steven C. Mason, president and chief operating officer, said. 
The white-paper mills have strong order backlogs, he said, and there's good demand for practically all the company's other major products.
