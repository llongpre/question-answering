   Weyerhaeuser Co. said Wednesday that its
second-quarter profit jumped 69 percent over a year ago because of
strong demand for pulp and paper products.
   Net income for the period ended June 28 was $150.6 million, or
71 cents a share, compared with earnings of $89.2 million, or 42
cents a share, in 1987. Sales rose to $2.1 billion from $1.8
billion.
   For the first half of 1988, the company's profit totaled $264.8
million, or $1.25 a share, on sales of $3.9 billion. That compared
with earnings of $191.1 million, or 92 cents a share, and sales of
$3.38 billion.
   Company president George Weyerhaeuser said markets for pulp and
paper products are continuing to strengthen.
   Weyerhaeuser's financial services subsidiaries and real estate
companies also reported significant improvement in overall
performance during the second quarter.
   Weyerhaeuser's Pacific Northwest woods and wood product mill
contracts have expired, but workers have remained on the job as
negotiators await a federal mediator to call them back to the
bargaining table.
