   Second-quarter profits for Weyerhaeuser Co. increased 3 percent,
while Scott Paper Co.'s earnings slipped 5 percent, the forest
products companies said Tuesday.
   Tacoma, Wash.-based Weyerhaeuser said it earned $154.8 million,
or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter compared with $150.6
million, or 72 cents per share for the same period last year.
   Net sales for the quarter totaled $2.64 billion, up 8 percent
from the $2.4 billion for second-quarter 1988.
   For the first half of the year, Weyeerhaesuser unet income was
$303 million or $1.43 a share, up 14 percent from the $265.4 million
or $1.26 a share in the same period last year. Net sales rose to
$4.97 billion, from $4.59 billion.
   Income figures for 1988 were restated to conform with a new
accounting standard affecting the company's GNA financial services
subsidiary, Weyerhaeuser reported. The change added one cent to 1988
per-share figures.
   Pulp and paper markets and pricing continue generally strong,
said Weyerhaeuser chairman and chief executive officer George H.
Weyerhaeuser.
   Some discounting is occurring in newsprint and other papers while
containerboard packaging markets are relatively stable, he said.
   The company's newsprint business has been hurt by lower prices in
Western U.S. markets as well as lower export prices and material and
energy cost increases, the company said.
   In forest products, domestic and overseas demand for Western
products has remained at a high level, the company said. But it
added that there is a weak market and soft pricing in Eastern and
Southeastern states.
   In another development, Weyerhaeuser announced Monday that it wil
sell its Specialty Plants Division, another move in its plan to
concentrate on the forest products business.
   The 53-person division, based in the Tacoma suburb of Fife, does
about $3.5 million in sales each year. It markets preserved palms
and floral materials.
   Philadelphia-based Scott earned $71.5 million, or 93 cents per
share, in the second three months of 1989, down from $75.3 million,
or 98 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose nearly 8 percent to $1.25 billion from $1.16 billion a
year earlier.
   Philip E. Lippincott, Scott chairman and chief executive, blamed
the second-quarter slump on price controls and tough competition in
Mexico, higher pulp costs, manufacturing problems in the company's
S.D. Warren printing and publishing papers business and slower than
expected growth in the food service business.
   For the first six months of the year, Scott's earnings increased
nearly 6 percent to $158 million, or $2.05 per share, on sales of
$2.52 billion. The company earned $149.3 million, or $1.95 a share,
on sales of $2.29 billion a year earlier.
