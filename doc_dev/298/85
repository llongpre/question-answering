   International Paper Co., the first big paper company to report fourth-quarter earnings, said profit climbed 11% in the quarter and 33% in the full year. 

   In line with analysts' forecasts of another 18 months of industry growth, International Paper, Purchase, N.Y., predicted that 1988 will bring further profit improvement from current levels. 

   The weak dollar has been helping paper companies open up export markets while thwarting foreign competition in the U.S. International Paper cited the weak dollar as a major reason for its fourth-quarter profit increase to $125 million, or $1.14 a share, from $113 million or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. 

   After being rocked by October's market crash, paper companies' stock prices have generally been recovering. 
International Paper climbed 37.5 cents yesterday to $38.625 a share in New York Stock exchange composite trading. 

   International Paper's year-to-year comparison would have been better except that the 1986 period included a gain of about $36 million from a number of one-time items including the sale of the company's New York headquarters building. 

   Sales in the quarter rose about 5% to $2.0 billion from $1.9 billion. 

   For the full year, net totaled $407 million, or $3.68 a share, compared with $305 million, or $2.89 a share, in 1986. 
Sales rose 42% to $7.8 billion from $5.5 billion. 

   International Paper didn't indicate how much earnings improvement it expects this year. 
It said the combination of a weak dollar, little planned new capacity and strong demand for all paper products should make 1988 another strong year. 

   The company said the 1987 increases in sales and earnings reflect several factors, notably the inclusion of a full year of sales and earnings from Hammermill Paper Co., acquired in late 1986; "strong pricing and demand levels for nearly all our paper product lines, particularly containerboard and pulp; continued improvement in the productivity of our mills . . . and strong demand and improved pricing in our timber and wood-products businesses."
