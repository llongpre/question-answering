   Federal Paper Board Co. said its third-quarter earnings
rose 10%, largely reflecting a nonrecurring charge in the
year-ago quarter associated with a mill expansion.
   The Montvale, N.J., pulp producer and maker of paperboard
products said net for the quarter ended Sept. 7 increased to
$24.2 million, or 55 cents a share, from $21.9 million, or 50
cents a share, a year ago. In the year-earlier quarter, the
company took a non-cash charge of 12 cents a share associated
with the expansion of its bleached paperboard mill in
Augusta, Ga.

   Sales rose 15% to $341.8 million from $296.5 million, with
the increase largely reflecting the acquisition of a cup
business in the year-ago fourth quarter.
   John R. Kennedy, president, said the improved results make
the company "optimistic for the future." He noted that the
paper industry is still operating in a tough economic
climate.
   For the nine months, net fell 20% to $76.7 million, or
$1.75 a share, from $95.3 million, or $2.23 a share. Sales
rose 9.6% to $1.02 billion.
