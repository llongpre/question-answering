<LEADPARA>  Mead Corp. said its first-quarter earnings fell 66 percent because of the
decline in the economy and general weakness in the paper and wood products
industry.;    The forest products company said it earned $13.4 million, or 23
cents a share, in the three months ended March 31. That compared with $39.5
million, or 62 cents a share, for the same period in 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mead's first-quarter sales were $1.10 billion, down 3.5 percent from $1.14
billion a year ago.;    "Overall, Mead's volume has been stable, but prices
and margins were down," said Burnell Roberts, chairman and chief executive
officer. "Our results reflect the slowdown in the general economy and large
additions to industry papermaking capacity which are currently affecting all
paper and forest products companies.";    The company said weak demand and low
prices for pulp and wood products had a significant impact on earnings.;   
Net income from jointly owned companies, principally Northwood Forest
Industries Ltd., decreased overall earnings by 22 cents a share, Mead said.
Northwood Forest is a Canadian affiliate owned by Mead and Noranda Inc.;   
Mead also said interest expense decreased earnings by 12 cents a share.  </TEXT>
