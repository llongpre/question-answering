<HEAD>Weyerhaeuser Earnings Drop 26 percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>

   Second-quarter declines of 26 percent in
profits and 10 percent in sales were reported Tuesday by the
Weyerhaeuser Co., with the pulp and paper markets blamed for most
of the slump.
   A statement issued by the forest products corporation said net
earnings for the 13 weeks ending July 1 amounted to $114.3 million
or 54 cents a share on $2.4 billion in net sales, down from $154.9
million or 73 cents a share on $2.6 billion in sales for the
year-earlier period.
   Sales for the first six months of fiscal 1990 were $4.7 billion,
down 6 percent from 1989's first-half sales of $5 billion, while
net earnings fell from $302.9 million or $1.43 a share to $244.3
million or $1.15 a share, a 19 percent decline.
   Company chairman George H. Weyerhaeuser said the biggest factor
in the second-quarter drop was a 40 percent decline in earnings on
pulp and paper products over the past year.
   The pulp division was hit by maintenance work that cut
production at a time of soft markets, and prices were weak in the
paper division until a recent upward turn, Weuerhaeuser said.
   Forest products results were flat as a decline in export volumes
and lower prices for Western products were offset by stronger sales
of southern lumber and plywood and better results for engineered
fiber panels.
   Real estate earnings slumped, largely because of weak markets in
Baltimore, Southern California and Florida, while a reorganization
of financial services brought gains in mortgage and insurance
subsidiaries, the statement said.
   A corporate structural review will be completed in the third
quarter, with reorganization and improvement plans for lumber and
plywood to begin taking effect in September, Weyerhaeuser said.
