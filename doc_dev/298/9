   Potlatch Corp. said its fourth-quarter earnings plunged
89% to $4.6 million, or 16 cents a share.
   The San Francisco forest-products company cited weak
markets and maintenance shutdowns at two pulp and paperboard
mills. A year ago, Potlatch earned $40 million, or $1.38 a
share. Sales for the latest period declined 8% to $290.7
million from $315.8 million.

products.
