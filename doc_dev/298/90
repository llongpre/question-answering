INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US paper group which has been expanding fast in
Europe, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 176m, after
taking a Dollars 263m after-tax charge for a productivity improvement
programme.
The company said the results worked through at a loss of Dollars 1.46 a
share and were struck on sales of Dollars 3.4bn. Without the charges,
earnings totalled Dollars 87m, or 71 cents a share.
In the fourth quarter of 1991 the company earned Dollars 107m, or 96 cents a
share, before special charges and Dollars 66m, or 59 cents a share, after
charges.
Mr John Georges, chairman, said the company had achieved fourth-quarter
sales comparable to the second and third quarters, despite difficult
conditions in both the US and European economies.
'Weak prices continued to hamper earnings in pulp, coated and uncoated
printing and writing papers.
'Ongoing strong performances were seen, however, in timber and wood products
businesses.'
Pulp and paper saw sales up from Dollars 970m to Dollars 995m, while
paperboard and packaging rose from Dollars 870m to Dollars 895m and
distribution from Dollars 685m to Dollars 735m. Specialty products ware up
from Dollars 485m to Dollars 545m, while timber and wood products were
unchanged at Dollars 350m.
For the full year, International Paper reported net earnings of Dollars 86m,
or 71 cents a share, after special charges and Dollars 405m, or Dollars 3.34
a share, before charges.
Sales totalled Dollars 13.6bn, up from Dollars 12.7bn in 1991.
Net earnings in 1991 totalled Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, after
special charges and Dollars 452m, or Dollars 4.09 a share before charges.
