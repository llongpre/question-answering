<HEAD>Georgia Pacific Earnings Dip, Reflecting Costs of Great Northern
Takeover</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS reports from Champion, Bowater</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. reported Thursday its
second-quarter earnings declined 38 percent as costs from its
takeover of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. offset strong sales.
   Other paper companies also reported steep drops in earnings.
Bowater Inc., of Darien, Conn., reported 63 percent decline and
Stamford, Conn.-based Champion International Corp.'s profit dropped
44 percent.
   Georgia-Pacific said its net income fell to $107 million, or
$1.25 a share, from $172 million, or $1.90 a share, in the same
period of 1989.
   The recent three-month period was the first full quarter in
which the two corporations were combined. Georgia-Pacific and
Connecticut-based Great Northern agreed in February to a $5 billion
merger, creating the nation's largest paper and forest products
company.
   Georgia-Pacific's sales for the quarter totaled $3.5 billion, up
from $2.6 billion a year earlier, but the increase was offset by
takeover-related interest expenses, the company said.
   Interest expenses rose to $185 million from $66 million a year
ago.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr., in a statement
accompanying the earnings report, stressed the sales gains.
   ``The company's building products business has experienced a
record second quarter,'' Hahn said, noting that despite a decline
in housing starts the company has benefited from an increased
demand for materials used in the remodeling and repair market.
   Prices for the company's forestry products are up also because
of a diminishing supply of timber in the Northwest, he said.
   The company's pulp and paper divisions have shown gains mainly
because of demand for communication papers, Hahn said.
   For the six months ending June 30, Georgia-Pacific's net income
was $208 million or $2.43 per share, down 36 percent from $326
million or $3.55 a share for the first six months of 1989.
   First-half sales totaled $6.2 billion, up from $5.1 billion
during the same period a year earlier.

   Champion said its earnings drop was caused by production losses
and higher taxes on a Brazilian subsidiary.
   Champion's after-tax profit for the second quarter was $63
million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $114 million, or
$1.16 per share, for the same period last year.
   The company reported $81.8 million in income from operations for
the second quarter, compared with $207.4 million for the second
quarter of 1989.
   The second-quarter figures include $43 million set aside to pay
for costs incurred in cutbacks at its Canton, N.C., mill.
   In addition, Champion had several one-time gains in the second
quarter, including $11 million from the sale of a portion of its
West Coast Timberlands division, $18 million from the disposal of
fixed assets and divested operations and $39 million from the
favorable resolution of issues related to the merger with St. Regis
Corp.
   Income dropped at the company's Brazilian subsidiary due to an
economic reform package that included higher taxes, the company
said.

   Bowater Inc. blamed a continued slump in newsprint prices for
its earnings drop. Bowater said another factor contributing to the
drop was a $9 million, one-time charge to retire 12&rsqb; percent
interest rate bonds.
   For the second quarter, after-tax profit totaled $14.2 million,
or 36 cents per share, on revenue of $342.3 million. That compared
to earnings of $38 million, or $1.01 per share, on revenue of
$363.6 million for the same period last year.
   A.P. Gammie, chairman and chief executive officer of Bowater,
said he expected newsprint prices to rise in the second half of
1990.
