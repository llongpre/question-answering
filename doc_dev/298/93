   Mead Corp. said first-quarter earnings fell 66% to $13.4
million, or 23 cents a share, as a result of the economic
slowdown and added capacity in the paper industry.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the Dayton, Ohio, company
earned $39.5 million, or 62 cents a share.

   First-quarter sales declined 3.5% to $1.10 billion from
$1.14 billion.
   The paper products and data services concern said that
volume remained stable in the quarter, but that prices and
margins were down as a result of the recession and extra
paper-making capacity. It cited first-quarter pricing and
demand problems for pulp and wood products. Losses from its
jointly owned Canadian Northwood Forest Industries Ltd.
reduced earnings by 22 cents a share. Mead also said higher
interest expenses reduced earnings by 12 cents a share.
   Mead said revenue from its computer-assisted research
services business grew, but at a slower pace than a year ago,
reflecting less activity in legal and financial markets.
