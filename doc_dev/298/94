   Weyerhaeuser Co. said second-quarter net income tumbled
39% to $69.6 million, or 35 cents a share.
   The Tacoma, Wash., forest products company cited weak pulp
and paper prices and lost production because of
maintenance-related mill shutdowns. In the year-earlier
quarter, Weyerhaeuser earned $114.3 million, or 54 cents a
share. Sales for the latest period dropped 4%, to $2.3
billion from $2.39 billion.
