   MONTVALE, N.J. -- Federal Paper Board Co. reported a 29%
drop in earnings for its fiscal second quarter -- results
expected to be among the better performances by paper
companies as the industry slump continues.
   "The company will be second to third best" of the 17
companies that will report earnings this month, said Lawrence
Ross of PaineWebber Inc., who expects Federal Paper's results
to be bested by Kimberly Clark Corp. and Louisiana-Pacific
Corp. He predicts that the companies as a group will post an
earnings decline of 55% from the 1990 second quarter. In the
first quarter, paper company profits dropped 64% from a year
earlier, he said.

   Federal Paper Board said earnings in the 12 weeks ended
June 15 fell to $24.6 million, or 56 cents a share, from
$34.6 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier,
reflecting higher interest expense and depreciation charges.
The latest profit figure includes a nonrecurring charge of
six cents a share from the retirement of assets related to
the expansion project of the company's Augusta mill.
   Sales -- including those of Continental Bondware Inc.,
which Federal acquired last September -- rose 9.1% to $346.2
million from $317.2 million. But expenses increased even
faster, rising 19% to $304.2 million from $256.2 million.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Federal Paper Board rose to $31.375 a share from $31.
   Federal Paper, which gets half of its sales from
paperboard, emerged from the latest quarter in better shape
than companies that make uncoated free sheet, coated papers
and liner board, which saw significant erosion in prices,
said Sherman Chao of Salomon Brothers Inc. Companies with
large exposure in these segments, such as Boise Cascade
Corp., Champion International Corp. and Georgia-Pacific
Corp., are expected to post losses, he said.
   But Federal Paper Board isn't out of the woods yet.
Paperboard prices strengthened in the quarter partly because
producers are in the later stages of rebuilding their plants,
which has temporarily reduced capacity. But as these
rebuilding projects are completed, pressure on prices may
renew. Toward the end of the year, "companies will do well if
all they see is the current price increase rescinded," Mr.
Chao said.
   In the fiscal half ended June 15, Federal Paper Board's
profit fell 28% to $52.5 million, or $1.21 a share, from
$73.4 million, or $1.73 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose
6.9% to $678 million from $634 million.
