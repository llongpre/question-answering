   WAYNE, N.J. -- Union Camp Corp. reported a 16% drop in
earnings for the fourth quarter as low paperboard prices and
a weak building-products market offset strength in paper.
   The current year also will be difficult, said Chairman
Gene Cartledge, "as we contend with {high} industry capacity,
as well as an economic downturn." He cited expansions of two
mills that should be completed by midyear. But he said that
"once we move beyond the downturn, our current expansion
program will significantly increase our output, quality,
efficiency and cash flow."

   The maker of paper products and wood-based chemicals said
net income in the quarter was $52.2 million, or 77 cents a
share, down from $62.2 million, or 90 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales rose 5.8% to $715.4 million from $676 million.
   Mr. Cartledge noted that "demand for paper and packaging
products remained healthy in spite of the weakening overall
economy" in the quarter. Prices for some business papers
improved over 1989 levels, he said. But prices for linerboard
and corrugated containers, "while stable with third-quarter
levels, were well below those of a year ago," he said. The
weak housing market hurt its building products business, but
its chemicals group, which makes turpentine and base products
for inks and adhesives, improved earnings last year.
   Full-year earnings were $229.6 million, or $3.35 a share,
down 23% from 1989's record earnings of $299.4 million, or
$4.35 a share. Sales rose 2.8% to $2.84 billion from $2.76
billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, in
a broadly higher market, Union Camp shares rose $1.375 to
close at $36.625.
