<HEAD>3rd Quarter Net Doubles at International Paper</HEAD>

   International Paper Co. said Tuesday its net
income nearly doubled in the third quarter, boosted by strong
demand, cost-control measures and acquisitions.
   In the three months ended Sept. 30, International Paper's
after-tax income totaled $201 million, or $1.74 a share, compared
with a net profit of $102 million, or 92 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion from $2 billion.
   For the first nine months, net income totaled $548 million, or
$4.76 a share, up 94 percent from $282 million, or $2.54 a share,
in 1987. Revenue rose 21 percent to $7 billion from $5.8 billion.
   The earnings report was released a day after the paperworkers
union called off a 16-month-old strike at International Paper mills
in three states without winning an agreement from the company.
   John A. Georges, chairman of the Purchase, N.Y.-based company,
said Tuesday that the packaging materials and white paper
operations put in a particularly strong performance. He said demand
and pricing for paper and paperboard products should remain strong
into the next year.
   Cost-control measures that were put into place some time ago are
continuing to have a positive impact on profit levels, spokesman H.
Ann Silvernail added.
   In addition, the company is continuing to see a benefit from the
acquisitions of Anitec and Kendall late last year. Anitec makes
photosensitive papers and Kendall manufactures non-woven fabrics.
   During the latest quarter, International Paper announced the
$400 million cash acquisition of Masonite, a subsidiary of USG
Corp. With 1987 sales of $529 million, Masonite is a major producer
of composite wood products for the furniture and home construction
industries.
