   Three Northwest forest products companies reported
first-quarter losses, reflecting the worst industry slump
since 1982.
   Louisiana-Pacific Corp., based in Portland, Ore., posted a
loss of $8.6 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with net
income of $35.8 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue declined 24% to $362.4 million from $474.8 million.
The company said its building-products division was
particularly hard hit, but that it could recover as the year
progresses if consumer confidence continues to rally.

   TJ International Inc., based in Boise, Idaho, reported a
loss of $1.9 million, or 33 cents a share, its first
quarterly deficit in 16 years. The company had a profit of
$1.6 million, or 23 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Sales, which fell 39% to $45.3 million from $74.3 million a
year ago, were adversely affected by lumber and window
dealers taking steps to minimize inventory. A TJ spokesman
said that despite its poor first-quarter performance, the
company expects to be profitable for all 1991.
   Boise Cascade Corp., also based in Boise, said it had a
loss of $16.9 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with net
income of $4.8 million, or four cents a share, a year ago.
The depressed price of lumber, particle board, plywood and
uncoated white paper, the single-largest grade produced by
Boise, depressed sales to $1 billion from $1.1 billion in the
year-ago quarter. Over capacity and weakened demand in the
paper-products division also affected earnings significantly,
the company said.
   Boise Cascade said operating income from its paper and
paper products, office products and building products sectors
fell sharply. As a result, the firm said, it reduced
administrative budgets and cut capital expenditures to $300
million for 1991, from $824 million last year.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Louisiana-Pacific rose 50 cents to $32.125 and Boise Cascade
fell 37.5 cents to $25.25. TJ International rose $2.25 to
$21.50 in over-the-counter trading.
