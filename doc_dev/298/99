   Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., one of Canada's largest forest products concerns, is considering joint-venture pulp and paper projects both in China and the Soviet Union. 

   William Turner Jr., chairman and chief executive, said that engineering teams have visited both countries but a major investment is likely to occur sooner in China. 
"I think you'll find us in the next year and a half doing something in China." 

   Consolidated-Bathurst is already associated with China in shared ownership of the Celgar Pulp Co., a pulp mill at Castlegar, British Columbia., which was purchased last year for 95 million Canadian dollars ($72.5 million). 

   Because of buoyant pulp markets, the venture has been very profitable from the start. 
The Chinese are committed to taking half of the mill's output but are selling a portion of it on the open market, Mr. Turner said. 

   "We're committed to put some money in China, but we want it to be successful and we know their expectations are high because of their success in Canada," he said. 
The major problem is finding a good wood supply in China, he said. 

   Wood supply isn't a problem in the Soviet Union, where forest resources are underutilized, especially in the Far East, said Mr. Turner, who visited the area last year. 
"They've got the resources but they don't have the (electric) power and it isn't likely they'll have the power for the next five years," said Mr. Turner. 

   Mr. Turner wouldn't speculate on earnings but said that the company's recent decision to raise the quarterly dividend to 16 cents from 12.5 cents is indicative of expectations for higher earnings for 1988. 
He noted that the company usually aims to pay out about 40% of its earnings. 

   That would indicate expected annual profit of about $1.60 a share in 1988. 
In the first nine months of this year, the company had operating profit of $122 million, or $1.08 a share, on sales of $1.66 billion. 
A special gain of $28.8 million made final net $150.8 million or $1.36. 

   For the first nine months of 1986, the company had net income of $18.8 million on sales of $1.49 billion. 
Per-share income was seven cents, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split.
