   The operators of Logan International Airport
are vowing to challenge in court a government order that rejects a
new landing fee system designed to cut traffic at the congested
Boston airfield by discouraging small planes.
   The Transportation Department ruled Thursday that Logan's landing
fee structure, which had been closely watched by the aviation
community as a possible national precedent, was unreasonable,
discriminatory and in violation of federal law.
   Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi Weyforth Dawson signed an
order that gives the Massachusetts Port Authority seven days to
rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for $10.2 million in
federal aviation improvement grants for the current fiscal year.
   MassPort officials immediately attacked the ruling.
   ``It sounds like the Department of Transportation has really just
given in to political pressure from powerful special interest groups
and turned its back on millions of air travelers in New England and
throughout the nation,'' said Thomas Champion, assistant to the
executive director at MassPort.
   But opponents of the Logan plan hailed the ruling as a victory
for commuter air passengers, private plane pilots and small-town
America.
   ``This is a tremendous victory for greater public access to our
major airports,'' said Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., author of the
law that authorized the cutoff of federal funds to Logan if the
Transportation Department agreed that the landing fees were unfair.
   Operators of other major airports, including those in Los
Angeles, Denver and Minneapolis, were awaiting the decision to see
if the stiff fee structure could be used as a model in their own
battles to reduce air traffic, said Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert,
R-N.Y., a leading congressional opponent of the landing fee plan.
   Small commuter airlines and private plane owners vehemently
fought against the proposal, saying it would lock them out of Logan
and deprive air service to passengers in small communities where
there is no access to major airlines.
   Under Logan's revised fee structure, large jets are paying
significantly less than before, while small aircraft had their
landing fees increase from $25 to more than $100.
   Logan officials defended the new fee structure, which went into
effect in July after a federal district judge in Boston ruled that
the fees were not discriminatory.
   Champion said the landing fee plan had succeeded in reducing
congestion at Logan, which is the largest airport in New England,
and that access had not been restricted for commuters.
   The new fee structure was based on a combination of airplanes'
weight and other operating costs.
   The original fee rate charged planes a minimum of $25 or $1.31
per 1,000 pounds, which ever was greater. Most small planes paid
$25. Under the revised fee structure, which was increased again in
October, all planes are assessed a $103 flat fee plus 55 cents per
1,000 pounds.
   MassPort Executive Director David W. Davis said fees for a Boeing
747, which had ranged up to $800, have been cut roughly in half
under the new fee structure while the landing fee for a Cessna 402
seating 10 passengers jumped from $25 to about $105.
