   The Transportation Department, concerned about
local officials interfering in the free flow of air travel,
announced an investigation Friday into plans to sharply increase
landing fees for small aircraft at Boston's Logan International
Airport.
   Private pilots and some commuter airlines have complained loudly
that the higher fees will amount to them being driven from Boston's
major airport.
   At the same time, Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley asked the
operators of Logan to hold off on the landing fee increases, which
are to go into effect July 1, until the department's investigation
has been concluded next November.
   Despite the federal urging, officials of the Massachusetts Port
Authority, the state agency that runs the airport, said they plan
to go ahead with the higher landing fees as scheduled.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to delay (the fee increase),''
David Davies, executive director of Massport, said in a telephone
interview.
   A spokesman for Massport, Thomas Champion, said the higher fee
structure remains ``an essential first step in our overall program
to improve service at Logan for all New England travelers. It
should be implemented without delay and we're committed to a July 1
startup date.''
   The Transportation Department in a statement called the Massport
decision to proceed with the higher fees ``disppointing'' but said
it is ``premature to speculate whether the new fee schedule will
actually go into effect.''
   The plan calls for base landing fees to be increased from $25 to
nearly $100 with an additional charge pegged to the weight of the
aircraft. This would sharply increase the fees required from
operators of small, personal planes, business aircraft and
commuters, while the costs to the major airlines in some cases
would decline, critics complain.
   Burnley has been under intense pressure in recent months from
groups representing private pilots and commuter airlines as well as
some members of Congress to intervene in the Massport issue, which
is seen as a maneuver by the airport's operators to drive away all
but the scheduled airlines.
   Officials at crowded airports around the country are known to be
closely watching the Massport case and what actions the federal
government might take.
   Legislation designed to prevent the Logan plan from being
implemented has been introduced in Congress, but its chances for
passage seem slight this year.
   ``This is just the first foot over the line,'' Rep. Sherwood
Boehler, R-N.Y., said recently of the Massport proposal. ``There
are airports all over the country sort of foaming at the mouth,
just waiting to follow suit.''
   The Transportation Department said its investigation
specifically would examine complaints received about the higher
fees at Logan from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the
National Business Aircraft Association and the Regional Airlines
Association.
   These complaints indicate that ``reasonable grounds exist to
investigate whether Massport's action violates'' federal aviation
laws, the department said. Burnley said he would decide whether
further action is necessary after the report is received sometime
before Nov. 15.
   In a letter to Massport officials, Burnley urged that the new
landing fee structure not be implemented until the federal
investigation is completed because of ``the potential impact'' and
because the complaints about the fees ``raise questions involving
national transportation policy.''
   Davis said he was perplexed by the DOT request because a federal
court in Boston had already agreed to consider expeditiously a suit
challenging the higher fees with hopes of a ruling before they are
imposed. The court case is expected to give the issue a full
review, he suggested.
