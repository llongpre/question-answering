   Logan International Airport's operators haven't
ended their fight after grudgingly complying with a federal order to
halt hefty fees that were designed to dissuade small craft from
landing at the crowded airfield.
   The new landing fee system had been watched closely by the
aviation industry nationwide as a possible precedent for dealing
with congestion at major airports. Federal officials rank Logan
among the country's 10 most congested airports.
   Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation ruled the fee
structure was unreasonable, discriminatory and in violation of
federal law.
   Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi Weyforth Dawson signed an
order Thursday that gave the Massachusetts Port Authority seven days
to rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for $10.2 million
in federal aviation improvement grants for this fiscal year.
   In response, Port Authority officials voted Tuesday to
temporarily suspend the increased landing fees beginning today, but
to file a request with the U.S. Court of Appeals here seeking a
review of the matter.
   ``We are simply recognizing that an aircraft carrying hundreds
and hundreds of people should not have to wait in line while a small
craft carrying maybe one or two people lands,'' said Theresa
McAlpine, a spokeswoman for the state agency.
   Bob Marx, a spokesman for the federal agency, said it would have
no comment on the Port Authority vote.
   Small aircraft lobbyists said they would continue their vigorous
opposition to the plan, which they said cost them an average of 500
percent more in fees.
   ``At this point the whole case has been ... groundbreaking. We
feel that the Department of Transportation's decision is final and
binding and certainly very clear,'' said Patricia Weil, a spokesman
for the national Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
   The Program for Airport Capacity Efficiency, which went into
effect July 1, was intended to reduce congestion and delays by
charging fees so high they would discourage users of small craft
from flying in and out of Logan.
   Under the new fee structure, all planes were assessed an $88 flat
fee and 47 cents per 1,000 pounds. The old system charged $1.31 per
1,000 pounds or $25, whichever was greater.
   The new fee for a Boeing 747, for example, dropped to $450 from
$680, while a Cessna 402 seating 10 passengers was charged $106
versus $25, McAlpine said.
   Organizations representing small aircraft pilots reacted by
filing complaints in court and with the federal Department of
Transportation.
