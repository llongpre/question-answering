<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Finds Logan Fees Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Massachusetts Port Authority unreasonably and
illegally imposed a dual set of landing fees to discourage small
planes from using Logan International Airport, a federal appeals
court ruled Thursday.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
wrote that Massport's its landing fee system had been
unscientifically developed and unfairly discriminated against small
planes.
   Massport's policy was based on the premise that commercial jets
carrying 400 passengers should have priority over a six-seat private
plane, but federal law has long held that all aircraft should have
equal access to U.S. runways.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation, which objected to
Massport's fees, ``has broad authority and responsibility to
regulate navigable airspace to assure its efficient use ... and to
protect `the right of freedom of transit through navigable
airspace,''' the court ruled.
   Massport officials said they were disapppointed with the decision
but hope to work with new leadership at the transportation
department in Washington to ease delay and congestion at Logan.
   Massport last year raised the landing fee for small aircraft at
Logan from a flat $25 per touchdown to a minimum of $100. At the
same time, commercial jet fees were cut. A jumbo jet, for example,
saw its $800 fee cut in half.
   The owners of private and commuter planes complained, but traffic
dropped by one-third and on-time performance for commercial jets
surged from last place among the country's 27 largest airports in
May 1988, to second place in December 1988.
