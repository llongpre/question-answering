   Logan International Airport authorities announced steps intended to reduce aircraft congestion during peak hours and to divert smaller aircraft to other regional airports. 

   Some of the steps would require federal approval, the authorities said. 
But David Davis, executive director of Massachusetts Port Authority, which oversees the airport, indicated he might try to implement the measures even if federal approvals aren't forthcoming. 

   Among the steps under consideration are increasing minimum landing fees and charging terminal fees for small aircraft, imposing surcharges during peak hours, and limiting commuter airline operations. 

   A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said the agency's lawyers hadn't yet seen the Logan proposals and couldn't comment. 

   Air traffic at Logan has increased substantially in recent years, making it one of the country's most congested airports.
