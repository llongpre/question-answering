   To sports fans here, it's a crime the way officials sometimes let the Detroit Pistons get away with elbowing and shoving the hometown Celtics. 
But there's at least one Piston violation that Boston isn't about to ignore: Flying a noisy jet over Beantown late at night. 

   Following a double-overtime loss to the Celtics in a playoff game here Friday evening, the Pistons piled into their BAC-111 team airplane and thundered off for Detroit at 12:30 a.m. -- flouting a rule at Boston's Logan International Airport banning flights of loud aircraft between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. 

   "The BAC-111 is one of the noisiest planes in the system," says Phil Orlandella, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs the airport. 
"They clearly violated our noise-abatement rules." 

   He adds that this was no technical violation; it was, he says, only the last in a flurry of airport fouls by the Pistons in the team's latest trip to Boston. 
For instance, he says, the plane was initially parked where it wasn't supposed to be, and then taxied against airport rules to another spot. 
That riled airport officials, "but we didn't cite them," says Mr. Orlandella. 

   The noisy takeoff, however, went too far. 
"The Pistons like to slam-dunk you on these things," says Patrick Moscaritolo, Logan's acting aviation director. 
Airport officials are requesting an explanation from the Pistons' management and may file criminal charges against it. 

   A spokesman for the Pistons declines to comment on the matter. 

   The spat, meanwhile, has added fuel to another fire. 
U.S. Rep. Bob Carr, a Michigan Democrat whose district includes Pontiac, site of the Pistons' arena, has been threatening to request a cutoff of federal funds to the Boston Port Authority unless it delays a plan to sharply raise landing fees at Logan for smaller aircraft. 

   In an interview with the Associated Press, Rep. Carr charged that the airport's complaints about the Pistons' plane is either "part of your basic Boston Garden harassment" or "because we're coming down pretty hard" on the Port Authority regarding landing fees. 

   Boston is hanging tough, though. 
Says Logan's Mr. Orlandella: "Who the hell is he (Rep. 
Carr) to tell us how to run our airport?" 
Mr. Moscaritolo adds that if necessary, the Port Authority is ready to square off in a Boston court against the Pistons. 
"The judge lives right under Logan's flight path," he adds.
