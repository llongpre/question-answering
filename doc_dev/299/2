   The Transportation Department and the Massachusetts Port Authority are headed for a showdown in a case that holds major implications for the way airports handle air-traffic congestion. 

   On Friday, Transportation Secretary James Burnley opened an investigation into a new landing-fee schedule for Boston's Logan International Airport. 
He asked the port authority to delay implementing the new schedule, which is due to go into effect July 1, until after the investigation is completed, probably by mid-November. 

   But Tom Champion, assistant to port authority chief David Davis, said the local agency will likely refuse the department's request. 
"Everything we know tells us it will be a significant benefit to New England travelers during the summer travel season," he said. 

   Currently, landing fees at Logan, and other airports throughout the U.S., are determined by an aircraft's weight, so that big planes pay substantially more than smaller ones. 
But Logan, like other big airports, is congested, and the port authority decided to try to reduce the crowding by encouraging smaller planes to land elsewhere. 
To that end, its new fee schedule is based on a flat landing fee per aircraft, plus an additional charge based on weight. 
The effect will be to reduce fees for big planes and increase them for small planes. 

   For example, the fee for a Boeing 727 would drop to about $160 per landing from the current $200. 
A nine-passenger Cessna 402, which currently pays about $25 to land, would pay about $91 under the new schedule. 
If the Logan scheme is successful, some other airports undoubtedly will take similar steps. 

   The port authority estimates that the new fee schedule will reduce Logan traffic by 5% almost immediately, as some small-plane pilots switch to smaller local or regional airports. 
The authority predicts that over time some commuter lines will move to using bigger planes. 

   But critics contend that the plan violates rules barring airports that receive federal funds from treating different classes of aircraft in an unfair or discriminatory way. 
Mr. Burnley's order, in which he said there were "reasonable grounds" for an investigation, is a big boost for three groups that have filed complaints with the department: the National Business Aircraft Association, which represents companies operating corporate jets, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which represents private pilots, and the Regional Aircraft Association, which represents commuter airlines. 

   Meanwhile, some of the aviation groups and some regional business groups have sued the port authority in federal court in Boston. 
The judge in the case has pledged to give the matter speedy consideration, but it isn't clear what effect the department's action will have on the lawsuit. 

   The dispute also has split the New England congressional delegation; a number of lawmakers from states such as Maine and Vermont are critical of the new fee schedule, fearing it will hurt commuter airlines, while many Massachusetts representatives support it. 

   In any case, port authority officials argue that their plan won't discriminate against smaller planes, but simply end what amounts to a landing-fee subsidy by larger planes. 
They add that, as airports throughout the U.S. become increasingly crowded, airport officials will have to figure out a way to keep traffic at a manageable level.
