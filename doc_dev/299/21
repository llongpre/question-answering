   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Gridlock in the vast open skyways? Well, it's not
that dire yet, but aviation officials are worried that today's
airports won't be able to handle the amount of traffic expected in
the next decade or so. Further, little is being done about it. Here
is a report from an AP reporter who covers the aviation beat in
Washington.

   On the day before Christmas, some 2 million
people rushed to airports across America, expecting turmoil or
delays. They often found both.
   That kind of airport crush, now usually seen only on Thanksgiving
and Christmas, is likely to become commonplace by the year 2000 when
the airlines expect to carry nearly 800 million passengers a year,
an average of more than 2 million every day.
   Hello, gridlock.
   Yes, aviation officials are beginning to worry about a logjam in
the air.
   Once the domain of businessmen and the well-heeled, the airlines
have become a mass transit system. A record 455 million passengers
boarded commercial aircraft in 1988, nearly 1.2 million people a
day, compared to 243 million in l977.
   Three of every 10 adults took an airline flight last year, and
nearly three of every four adults had flown at some point in their
lives.
   Yet, no major new airports have been built since 1974, when the
Dallas-Fort Worth airport was constructed on 18,000-acres of Texas
prairie. And while local officials have received agreement on a
massive, futuristic $3 billion airport at Denver, the airlines there
have balked because of the cost.
   Add to that an air traffic control system still struggling to
recover from a 1981 strike, plus federal budget constraints.
   The holiday passenger crunch ``gives us all a glimpse into the
future of air traffic,'' bemoans Herbert Kelleher, chairman of
Southwest Airlines. He says the air transport system of today
``lacks the capacity to handle that volume of traffic on a daily
basis.'' He also says there are scant signs that anything is being
done about it.
   ``I think the single biggest concern in aviation is the capacity
issue,'' agrees John Lauber, a member of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   The traffic demands also raise safety worries, he says,
especially since it is unlikely that dozens of new runways and
airports will be constructed and broad modernization of the air
traffic control system is years away.
   ``There are real questions as to how we are going to accommodate
this growth,'' Lauber warns.
   He acknowledges that there are ways to solve the congestion
problem short of pouring new concrete. But, he says, ``the danger is
that these things will be done before all of the ramifications are
thought through from a safety standpoint. The pressure is there.''
   Among the short-term solutions being considered by the Federal
Aviation Administration are adopting new technology to allow more
planes to land in a shorter time span and increasing use of
computers to predict traffic flow.
   Indeed, the overcrowding is being felt both in the air and on the
ground.
   Seventeen airports used by 40 percent of the flying public were
classified in 1988 as ``seriously congested'' because they handled
160 percent of the traffic for which they were designed. By the year
2000 that number could go as high as 58 airports used by nearly
three out of every four travelers, according to the FAA.
   Officials at Boston's Logan International Airport say as far as
they're concerned aviation gridlock already has arrived.
   Last summer, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan,
imposed a new fee structure that makes it too expensive for owners
of small planes and even some commuter airlines to land. The local
officials argue that in an era of scarce resources priority must be
given to large jetliners carrying hundreds of people.
   The federal Transportation Department has called the action an
interference with national commerce and threatens to withhold
federal airport funds if the fees are not reversed. The Logan
officials, meanwhile, are standing firm and intend to fight the DOT
ruling in court.
   The FAA is still trying to recover from the 1981 strike by air
traffic controllers in which 11,400 were fired and had to be
replaced by inexperienced recruits. While senior managers have drawn
up new flight patterns and adopted a system of central ``flow
control'' to better manage airspace with fewer controllers, problems
persist.
   Only last fall, controllers at Chicago's busy O'Hare
International Airport began making errors so frequently that the
federal government ordered a cut in flights. As a result, the number
of delays jumped.
   Furthermore, the agency's seven-year focus on damage control and
government-wide budget constraints have delayed for several years
the long-range modernization of its air traffic control system.
   The overhauled system is now scheduled for completion in the late
1990s at a cost of $16 billion to $24 billion.
   But many airline executives complain that the capacity crunch is
already here.
   ``We tend to be making a conscious effort to do everything
possible to restrain the transportation system that lies at the core
of travel and tourism,'' complains Robert Crandall, chairman of
American Airlines.
   Problems with air traffic control and restrictions of various
kinds already stifle competition, he argues.
   ``Today, American can't compete with Eastern, Pan Am or Donald
Trump (who recently bought the Eastern shuttle) between Washington
and New York. We can't add flights to and from Chicago, nor can we
operate the ones we already have there with the slightest assurance
that they will either arrive or leave on time.
   ``Even in Nashville our flights often sit on the ground waiting
for a slot in the sky. The reality is we are making air travel
harder and harder rather than making it easier and easier.''
   The airlines for more than a year have warned of impending chaos.
But a $15 million grass-roots campaign to persuade business and
political leaders to push for new airport capacity has so far
produced little.
   ``I don't see a hell of a lot of difference between our aviation
problems a year ago and our aviation problems today except today
they are worse,'' Crandall said at a recent industry conference.
   The industry is especially critical of the government's handling
of the billions of dollars that are collected each year through an 8
percent ticket tax. The money goes into a special trust fund, but in
recent years much more went in than has come out.
