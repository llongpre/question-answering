   Continental Airlines said Sunday an altercation
aboard one of its jets occurred after the plane touched down and
did not cause an aborted landing at Logan International Airport.
   The airline's explanation differed from an account given by the
Massachusetts State Police after interviewing the crew of Flight
358.
   Six people, including a counsel to the New Jersey Senate, his
wife and four Massachusetts residents, were arrested at Logan after
the fight.
   Steven Sacks-Wilner, 39, of Montgomery Township, N.J., and his
wife, Joanne, 37, were arrested when the flight from Trenton, N.J.,
landed at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, according to state police Cpl. Joseph
Howley.
   ``They had a little brawl,'' he said. ``It started out as a
husband and wife that were sort of running around the plane and
making demands on the crew and being a general nuisance and
hollering.''
   The fight between the couple occurred in the air, and expanded
to involve four other passengers, police said. The on-board
confusion led the pilot of the 146-passenger MD-80 aircraft to give
up on his first landing try, said Sgt. Stephen Kelley.
   ``They were fighting in the aisles just prior to touch down,''
Kelley said. ``The pilot was afraid that when the pilot reversed
throttle on his englines _ which you do not feel when you're in
your seat _ the whole troop that was fighting in the aisles would
have wound up in the cockpit.''
   Kelley said state police based their explanation on interviews
with the flight crew. He said the fight lasted 15 to 20 minutes.
   According to the airline, however, the fight began and ended
after the jet landed at Logan International Airport.
   The jet had had to bypass its first landing because a Northwest
Airlines jet was slow in taxiing out of the way, said Ned Walker, a
Continental spokesman.
   ``I have spoken with the captain who said there was a Northwest
plane on the runway that was slow to clear and resulted in his
decision to do what they call a go-around,'' Walker said.
   Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Boston, said Sunday that the Logan control tower
heard nothing of an on-board altercation before the landing.
   ``The airplane, making a normal approach, was given a routine
go-around because the airplane landing in front of him was slow in
clearing the runway,'' Ciccarelli said.
   The FAA has opened an investigation into the incident.
   Sacks-Wilner, the chief counsel for the Republican minority in
the New Jersey Senate, faces charges of interference with a flight
crew, disorderly conduct and three counts of assault on a police
officer, Howley said. Sacks-Wilner allegedly fought back at police
when they boarded the plane and arrested him.
   All those arrested were released from the state police lockup
pending arraignment Monday in East Boston District Court.
   Mrs. Sacks-Wilner and three Medford residents, Frank J.
Federico, 50, his wife Camella, 48, their son John, 22, all face
charges of interfering with a flight crew, as does John's
19-year-old girlfriend, Laureen Belmonte of Revere, Howley said.
   The Massachusetts passengers ``tried to assist the crew and
wound up getting in the crew's way,'' the state police corporal
said.
