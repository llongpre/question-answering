   The pilot of a World Airways jet that slid off an
icy runway into Boston Harbor in 1982 said a jury award of more
than $1 million justified his seven years of ``trauma and
heartache.''
   Pilot Peter Langley and co-pilot Donald Hertzfeldt had suffered
``emotional distress, impairment of earning capacity, lost wages
and minor physical injuries'' from the January 1982 crash, said
their attorney, Walter Walker.
   A federal jury Wednesday awarded Langley $1,021,840 and
Hertzfeldt $444,700.
   Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Logan International
Airport, does not believe the evidence supports the verdict and
plans to ask U.S. District Judge Robert A. Keeton to set the award
aside next week, said agency spokeswoman Teresa McAlpine. By law,
the pilot and co-pilot cannot seek damages against the federal
government.
   A separate federal jury earlier this year determined that the
crash was caused by icy runway conditions at Logan and that the
Federal Aviation Association and the port authority had failed to
apprise Langley of the situation. Yet another federal jury awarded
the airline more than $30 million for the loss of the jet.
   Langley, 64, said the decision was ``justification for one's
position over the last seven years and the trauma and all the
heartache that's been going on. In retrospect, I'd rather that it
hadn't happened. Now that it has, I think it is a fair judgment.''
   ``I think the last 30 seconds on the runway are something that
I'm going to live with the rest of my life,'' he said. ``For a
pilot to feel he's not fully in control of his airplane is a most
frightening experience.''
   Langley said he lost confidence and interest in flying after the
crash and gave up his plans to become a flight engineer after he
reached the mandatory retirement age of 60.
   Hertzfeldt is working as a Pan Am shuttle co-pilot, which Walker
said was the only job he could get with a crash on his record.
   Langley said he mentioned the tarmac seemed slippery when the
jet touched down. ``Then a few seconds later I said `No braking' to
the crew,''' Langley said.
   As the end of the runway approached he saw the landing lights
and pilings of a light tower that jutted out into Boston Harbor.
Langley said he was ``literally standing on the brakes, with the
engines in full reverse thrust.''
   When the DC-10 stopped, the front end was in Boston Harbor and
the nose, which had broken off, was partially submerged. The crew
had to swim to safety, and two people sitting in the front seats
were never found and presumably drowned.
