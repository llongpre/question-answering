   A TWA flight aborted its takeoff this morning
after fire and smoke was detected in an engine, a Logan Airport
official said. Seven people suffered minor injuries during the
emergency evacuation of the plane.
   Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority,

abandoned its takeoff at around 9:30. The flight was bound for St.

   Orlandella said the jet taxied off the runway and evacuation
chutes were deployed to help 163 passengers get off the plane.
There was also a crew of 13 on board. Seven people were slightly
injured, he said.
   MassPort crews found no smoke or fire when they inspected the
engine, he said.
