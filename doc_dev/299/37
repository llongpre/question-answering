   A fifth of vodka goes a long way. Adil Altom Hamza
drank most of one in Boston and woke up in a cargo plane on his way
to Ypsilanti, Mich.
   ``I'm drunk,'' he told Michigan State Police officers when he
walked off the four-engine Lockheed Electra at Willow Run Airport
in Ypsilanti at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.
   The troopers were there because the pilot, startled in
mid-flight by the appearance of Hamza radioed that he had a
stowaway.
   Hamza, a 27-year-old student from Sudan, told The Boston Globe
he drank most of a bottle of vodka while wandering Boston streets
alone Tuesday night, took public transportation to Logan
International Airport and got on a plane.
   ``I had a few drinks too many. All I can remember is looking for
a place to sleep,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The place he found was the cargo hold of the Zantop Airlines
plane, and that's where he woke up, scared and surprised, he said.
   ``It was dark. There were boxes all around me. It was freezing.
There was nothing there, just the feeling of flying. I thought it
was a nightmare.''
   He went through a door leading into the plane's cabin and tapped
on the shoulder of the flight engineer, one of three crew members,
to ask where he was.
   ``They were scared. Really scared,'' Hamza said. ``They thought
I was going to hijack the plane. But I said, `It's OK, I'm drunk.'
When the pilot said, `You are halfway across the U.S.,' I said, `Oh
my God.'''
   A half-hour later, the plane landed in Ypsilanti. State troopers
questioned Hamza and then let him sleep it off in the state police
lockup. Later they got him a bed at the Shelter Association of Ann
Arbor, and he slept 12 more hours.
   The Massachusetts Port Authority, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the FBI are trying to find out how Hamza evaded
security and got on the plane.
   Hamza, of Brookline, Mass., came to Boston more than three years
ago to attend the University of Massachusetts. He took off a term
this year and hopes to transfer to Northeastern University in the
fall, he said.
   Meanwhile, he is trying to find a way back to Boston. ``They are
going to let me sleep here, and they are feeding me,'' he said.
``Everyone is nice. I'm just trying to find a way back home now.
I'll work or take donations.''
