<HEAD>Detroit Jet Crash Focuses Attention on Close Calls</HEAD>

   The recent collision of two jets on the
taxiway at Detroit Metropolitan Airport was a rarity, but there are
dozens of close calls at airports around the nation each year,
safety officials say.
   The National Transportation Safety Board calls them
``incursions'' - incidents in which pilots report that another
airplane came dangerously close to theirs on the ground.
   They have occurred as often as once every 12,754 takeoffs or
landings, which is the ratio for such incidents during a 20-month
period at Logan International Airport in Boston, federal records
show.
   Statistics published Sunday in The Detroit News showed that none
of the incursions at other airports led to collisions, but the
incidents underscore a growing perception that they are becoming a
major industry problem.
   Detroit had 24 close calls reported among 643,000 operations
during the 20-month period that ended Aug. 31. The newspaper
reported the ratio of incursions at 19 major U.S. airports, but not
the actual number of occurrences.
   ``We've been concerned for some time about runway incursions,
and this Detroit accident has helped bring more attention to it,''
said John Lauber, an investigator for the federal safety board.
   ``In no way is it just a Detroit problem. It is a national
problem,'' he said.
   Eight people died Dec. 3 when two Northwest Airlines planes
collided in fog at Detroit Metro. One plane taxied onto the runway
where the other was rushing toward takeoff.
   The statistics were provided to the federal government by pilots
who file reports with the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a
program monitored by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``The hazard potential, the potential of a high-speed collision
is great,'' said David Haase, spokesman for the Airline Pilots
Association.
   ``We feel there are several areas that need to be addressed to
reduce the risk, everything from high-tech surface detection radar
to changing phraseology used by airport personnel,'' he said.
   Following are the 19 airports listed and the number of landings
or takeoffs for every reported incursion.
   Logan International Airport, 12,754; Cleveland Hopkins
International, 16,960; Newark, 18,114; Washington National, 19,035;
Lambert-St. Louis International, 19,675; Los Angeles International,
21,880; San Francisco International, 22,060; Chicago O'Hare,
22,300; Denver Stapleton, 22,571; Miami International, 24,517; New
York John F. Kennedy, 24,791; Detroit, 26,791; Dallas-Fort Worth,
26,977; Philadelphia International, 34,421; New York La Guardia,
37,687; Minneapolis, 43,285; Hartsfield Atlanta International,
54,318; Memphis, 92,666, and Houston Intercontinental, 102,200.
