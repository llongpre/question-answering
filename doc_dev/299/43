   A federal investigation and one of the busiest
travel weekends of the year combined to make the Eastern Airlines
terminal at Logan International Airport a waiting room for hundreds
of frustrated travelers.
   The Eastern ticketholders were stuck at the airport Sunday for
the third consecutive day that Eastern flights into or out of
Boston were delayed or canceled by mechanical problems.
   ``I'd rather be sitting by the pool than sitting here,'' Jack
Honen said while he waited for his flight to Florida.
   Eastern, which is the focus of a Federal Aviation Administration
investigation into mechanical and safety problems, was trying to
cope with the crowds on one of Boston's busiest travel weekends of
the year.
   ``What you've got is spring break _ they're all headed down
South. You've got Patriot's weekend and you've got the Boston
Marathon. We're busy in and out,'' said Thomas Hannah, Eastern's
manager for departure services.
   Hannah said the delays and cancellations were typical of any
large airline on a busy weekend. ``There's nothing really unusual
about that. You can go to Delta or Piedmont or what have you and
find the same thing,'' he said.
   Piedmont, United and Continental experienced no significant
delays Sunday, reservations clerks reported. A clerk who answered
the phone at Delta said she could not provide any information.
   An incoming Eastern flight Sunday morning from Orlando, Fla.,
was canceled because of equipment problems that required servicing,
Hannah said. A flight from Boston to Miami was delayed several
hours after Eastern mechanics discovered a fuel leak. And a flight
from Boston to Orlando was delayed three hours.
   ``The mechanics found some engine vibrations. They're working on
it,'' Hannah said.
   Hannah said FAA inspectors were in Eastern's Boston hangars
Sunday looking over the airline's planes. But he said the problems
that led to delays and cancellations had been found by Eastern
mechanics, not the inspectors.
   Honen and his family, of Hanover, were among many heading to
Disney World.
   ``If they were responsible for paying for one day of your
vacation that you lost, maybe they'd get their act together,''
Claire Honen said. She passed time playing cards on the floor with
her two children.
   Earlier Sunday, Eastern officials rerouted several dozen
passengers to LaGuardia Airport in New York City because they were
trying to make connections with a Carribean cruise leaving from
Florida. The passengers had to board an Eastern Shuttle to New York
so they could reach Miami.
   Hannah, who is based in Florida, said he came to Boston to help
manage the busy weekend and handle press questions.
   Three Eastern flights out of Logan were canceled Saturday and
two Eastern jets were taken out of service Friday because of
equipment problems, delaying hundreds of travelers.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Sunday that
starting today, his agency was expanding its airplane-by-airplane
inspection of aircraft to Continental Airlines, like Eastern a
subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company.
   Last week, the FAA began checking Eastern, and fined Eastern
$823,000 for violating safety regulations, authorities said.
   On Wednesday, the agency also began examining the finances and
management of the Houston-based Texas Air. Burnley said the
agency's concerns were raised by evidence that Eastern and
Continental airlines ``are under substantial, increasing financial
pressure.''
