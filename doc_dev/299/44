<HEAD>Report: Plane Landed on Wrong Runway at Boston Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wide-bodied passenger jet landed on the wrong
runway at Logan Airport in July, but the Federal Aviation
Administration had no record of the mistake, a newspaper reported
today.
   FAA officials have records of only seven of 20 ``runway
incursions'' at Logan reported to the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration during the first eight months of the year,
according to The Boston Globe.
   Barry Bermingham, FAA special projects manager for the New
England region, said an ``exhaustive search'' is under way to
determine why the agency was not aware of the July incident.
   He said it was possible the controller who handled the flight
decided the landing error did not create a safety hazard so no
report was filed.
   The incident was reported by the flight crew of the unidentified
commercial airliner to NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System.
NASA gives those who file reports anonymity and immunity from
penalties for possible wrongdoing.
   The system is designed to create a large data base of potential
safety problems so aviation officials can correct problems.
   The report states the plane was cleared to land at Logan in
cloudy weather with visibility of 15 miles.
   The pilot was using computers and an automatic pilot to approach
the designated runway. But he landed the plane manually because the
computer did not capture the glide slope, which is needed for an
instrument landing.
   The pilot said he had no idea he had landed on the wrong runway
until afterward. No one was injured.
