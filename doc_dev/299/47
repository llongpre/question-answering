   After weeks of delay, a cargo plane loaded with 42
tons of food, blankets and medical supplies for Armenian earthquake
victims departed Monday bound for the Soviet republic.
   On board were two physicians who will evaluate medical conditions
there and propose to Armenian authorities the establishment of ``a
steady stream of doctors, equipment and drugs going back and forth
on a regular basis,'' said Dr. Carolann Najarian of Mount Auburn
Hospital in Cambridge.
   It was the first such airlift from Boston since the Dec. 7 quake
that killed an estimated 25,000 people and left 500,000 people
homeless.
   The supplies, donated from all over the United States, have been
piling up at Logan International Airport since the day after the
quake and nearly filled a large hangar provided by Trans World
Airlines as a staging area.
   Monday's airlift delivered only about a quarter of the supplies.
   ``In this hangar, we've got $8 (million) to $10 million worth of
equipment,'' said Mike Nazarian, east coast chairman of Medical
Outreach for Armenia, a relief group. ``We need about two or three
more flights.''
   Nazarian said he hoped to arrange another airlift for the
remainder of the supplies next week.
   Twelve private relief planes have departed from other cities,
said Dikran Kaligian, executive director of the Armenian National
Committee. But two weeks ago, before transport could be arranged
from Logan, the Soviets called a temporary halt to shipments to
Armenia in order to take stock of which supplies were needed, and
where, he said.
   Armenian church and relief officials in the United States,
meanwhile, have been reluctant to airlift cargo without sending
their own people along to ensure the supplies reach the quake
victims for whom they are intended, Kaligian said.
   Kaligian said he knows of no relief supplies that have gone
astray, but the Armenians are taking no chances.
   ``They could divert it to Moscow, they could take everything,''
he said. ``We've had our personnel on board.''
   The cargo plane and crew were provided by Pan Aviation, based in
Miami and owned by Armenian-Americans. Medical Outreach paid for
fuel and operating costs, Nazarian said.
   The plane, loaded with bales of blankets, food, tents and medical
supplies ranging from antacids to antibiotics, left Logan at about
4:10 p.m. The schedule for the 14-hour trip to the Armenian capital
of Yerevan included a stop at Shannon, Ireland, officials said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and his
wife, Kitty, Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn and state House Speaker
George Keverian were at the airport at noon for a news conference on
the plane's departure.
   Dukakis said the supplies being stored in the hangar reflect
``the affection Massachusetts residents have for the people of
Armenia.''
   The two physicians, Najarian and Dr. Richard Aghababian of the
University of Massachusetts at Worcester, said they wanted to set up
a microbiology laboratory in Armenia to help test for infectious
diseases, which can spread after disasters.
   Mrs. Dukakis promised to help raise the money for the laboratory
if it turns out to be needed.
