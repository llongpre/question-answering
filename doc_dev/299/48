   Danes on Tuesday will be faced with
the tricky choice between their NATO allies and their longstanding
opposition to nuclear weapons in one of the country's most
important elections since World War II.
   The sudden storm over Denmark's role in the 16-nation alliance
came as a surprise to many voters, usually more worried about
unemployment and national debt than military issues. A ban on
nuclear weapons in peacetime has already been in effect for three
decades.
   The showdown began April 14 when the opposition, led by the
Social Democrats, pushed through a parliamentary resolution
requiring the government to notify visiting warships of the nuclear
arms ban.

   Soap opera actors say their characters have
started speaking ``See Dick run,'' Johnny Carson is actually tired
of time off and Bruce Willis has taken up gardening as a
scriptwriters strike enters week nine.
   Talks are suspended between the Writers Guild of America and the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers following the
WGA's walkout March 7 over residuals and creative control.
   And there's no relief in sight, with producer Stephen Cannell,
who's also a member of the guild, saying things could drag on until
January.

   The president of the American Psychiatric
Association is accused in a probate dispute of exploiting a woman
who gave him $80,000 a year in trusts and willed $5 million to a
psychiatric institute she founded during a decade of psychoanalysis
with him.
   The legal battle is between Dr. George Pollock, one of Chicago's
leading psychoanalysts, and Francis L. Lederer II, only child of
Anne P. Lederer, who died in 1984 at age 78.
   Pollock denies any wrongdoing.
   Mrs. Lederer left most of her estimated $5 million estate to a
non-profit institute she established four years earlier to promote
psychiatric research and music. None of the money has been paid,
however, because her son is contesting her will in Cook County
Probate Court. A trial is scheduled to begin July 5.

   For Michael Dukakis and George Bush, picking a
vice presidential nominee is a key step in putting together the
pieces of the Electoral College puzzle, as strategists try to fit
the person to the political geography.
   Should Dukakis pick a Southern senator as his running mate to
help the Democrats win in the region this fall?
   ``It just doesn't work when we go with two Northerners on the
ticket,'' says Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
   Should Bush name California Gov. George Deukmejian to the No. 2
spot on the GOP ticket to grab the biggest state's votes on Nov. 8?

   Jesse Jackson will most likely challenge
the seating of delegates at the Democratic convention this summer
because it appears party official will reject his call for what he
describes as fairness in the selection process, according to his
campaign chairman.
   Willie Brown, speaker of the California Assembly, said he and
other Jackson advisers have spoken to Democratic National Committee
chairman Paul Kirk and other party leaders about Jackson's
insistence that the delegate totals roughly correlate with the
popular vote.
   But those talks, Brown said, are ``not so far productive,'' and
the campaign will likely make challenges to the delegate slates of
states it considers unfair.

   The Senate is expected to open debate on the
new U.S.-Soviet missile treaty this week, provided the White House
and the Kremlin can resolve last-minute questions over verification
provisions and the use of futuristic technology.
   ``We're still conferring with the Senate and hope to come to a
resolution by Tuesday evening,'' an administration official said.
``We have discussed this with the Soviets and ... we feel confident
it can be resolved,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified.
   While only a handful of senators are on record as opposed to the
treaty, it is an open question whether there is time to ratify it
before President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev open
their Moscow summit meeting on May 29.

   A Boston effort to relieve runway congestion
by increasing landing fees for small planes is evolving into a
national debate over the role of major airports.
   What was a local dispute involving Logan International Airport
has spilled over to Congress, the Department of Transportation and
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``This is just the first foot over the line,'' said Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who has introduced legislation designed
to block Logan from implementing the plan. ``There are airports all
over the country sort of foaming at the mouth, just waiting to
follow suit.''

   A group of federal regulators working on ways
to prevent another stock market crash appears certain to clash with
activist members of Congress who want to do more than the
anti-regulation Reagan administration.
   The group, appointed in mid-March, is chaired by Treasury Under
Secretary George D. Gould and includes the heads of the Federal
Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   According to two sources familiar with its deliberations, the
focus of group's recommendations is likely to be improved
communication and cooperation among both exchanges and regulatory
agencies rather than jurisdictional changes requiring new
legislation.

   Farm program costs have exceeded Agriculture
Department estimates by more than $46 billion over a 15-year span,
the General Accounting Office said in a report released Sunday.
   Lawmakers ``know that USDA's budget forecasts cannot be
trusted'' because of the errors, says Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla.,
who requested the report from the General Accounting Office, a
congressional investigative arm.
   The errors make it difficult to foresee program costs and can
have an impact on the amounts that lawmakers authorize, English
said in a statement.

   Kristen Knouse doesn't think there's
anything special about a blind erson riding a horse in a national
college equestrian competition. But she had to fight for a chance
to prove that.
   The blind Rutgers University student has been riding horses,
using her sense of hearing to guide her, since she was 10 years old.
   ``It's easy. I can hear the horse's feet echo off the rail,''
Miss Knouse, 19, said in a telephone interview Sunday from her
hotel room in Laurinburg, site of Sunday's 15th Intercollegiate
National Championship Horse Show.
   Later in the day, she placed fourth out of 12 riders in the
walk-trot equitation class.
