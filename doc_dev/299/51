   Some travelers beat the pre-Thanksgiving rush by getting on
planes, trains and automobiles early, while harsh weather _ already
blamed for 14 deaths in four states _ caused delays today.
   Airports braced for the stampede of people heading home today,
traditionally one of the heaviest travel days of the year.
   Six people were killed in separate traffic accidents on snowy
roads in Minnesota on Tuesday. The storm snarled evening rush-hour
traffic in the Twin Cities area and up to 6 inches of snow coated
parts of North Dakota today.
   Eight deaths were blamed on high wind, slick roads or cold in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Maryland.
   And more than 200 Newark, N.J., residents were left homeless by
two wind-blown fires that destroyed a row of houses and an
apartment building.
   Edith and George Webber of rural Black Earth, Wis., had no
worries as they avoided the crunch and took a flight Monday to
Washington National Airport. They were being met by their son who
lives in Towson, Md.
   ``We offered to bring the turkey and he said `never mind,' so we
brought some Wisconsin cheese and some jams and stuff,'' said the
73-year-old Webber.
   Angela Ploof, 18, who works as a nanny in Bedford, N.Y., also
avoided the rush by leaving earlier this week for home in Mosinee,
Wis.
   ``It's a surprise for my mom,'' she said. ``It'll be a total
shock.''
   For today's travelers, the possibility of snow loomed over
several key airports.
   ``The weather reports for our four hubs _ Chicago, Denver,
Washington, D.C., and San Francisco _ indicates the possibility for
light snow to fall in three of those areas, with fog in San
Francisco,'' said Rob Doughty, spokesman for United Airlines, the
largest carrier at Chicago's O'Hare and the nation's second-largest.
   ``There is the potential for some delays across the system,'' he
said. ``When the weather affects the system, there's not a whole
lot any of us can do about it.''
   Light snow caused slight delays this morning at O'Hare, and the
Federal Aviation Administration implemented a nationwide air
traffic quota system, which keeps airplanes on the ground until
weather improves near their destinations.
   Dense fog had cut visibility to near zero Tuesday afternoon at
Salt Lake City's airport. The only planes allowed to land were
those equipped with new radar, said airport operations manager
Frank Ratliffe. The fog also contributed to commuter-hour accidents
on freeways, but none involved serious injuries.
   An estimated 210,000 people today were expected to pass through
O'Hare, the world's busiest airport. It usually handles about
160,000 per day.
   ``We advise that because of the volume of traffic, that people
leave earlier than usual for the airport,'' said Lisa Howard,
spokeswoman for the Chicago's Department of Aviation. ``And prior
to leaving, check with the airlines.''
   Los Angeles International Airport Manager Stephen Yee similarly
urged travelers to arrive at least two hours before domestic
flights and three for international flights to allow for long lines
at baggage check-in, ticket counters and passenger screening points.
   He also warned that closures in long-term parking facilities
were likely and urged travelers to use commuter shuttles.
   Maynard Scarborough, spokesman for Boston's Logan airport, said
a new program this year called ``Meet and Greet'' encourages people
to leave their cars at lots in the suburbs.
   ``People who park there are given a bus ticket which enables
them to ride into Logan on the bus at half-price, meet a traveler
who pays full fare and ride back,'' he said.
   The Baltimore-Washington Airport recruited Maryland Aviation
Administration employees to volunteer as ``holiday helpers'' for
the third year.
   The volunteers will be posted at busy locations to answer
questions and offer assistance to travelers.
   Amtrak reservations on the Seattle-to-San Francisco and
Seattle-to-Chicago runs today and Sunday have been sold out for two
months, said spokesman Art Lloyd.
   In New Jersey, one of the weather-related deaths occurred when a
tree toppled by gusting winds struck and killed a principal as she
was getting out of her car at her elementary school. And a
Baltimore woman died when a warehouse fell on her house.
   An 83-year-old woman in East Providence, R.I., suffered broken
bones in a fall, possibly caused by high wind, and died after
several hours outside in cold and rain, officials said.
   In Newark, Red Cross officials were attempting to find shelter
from the blustery weather for the 200 people displaced by the
fires. One of the fires apparently was started in abandoned
buildings by a homeless person trying to keep warm, authorities
said. The other blaze was arson, authorities said.
   Diane Curry, a first-floor resident of a burnt-out building,
fled safely through a window with her three children and pets.
   ``Everything's gone,'' she said. ``I'll stay with my sister
until I can be relocated.''
