   A developer whose firm rejuvenated urban centers
around the country was killed along with his wife and daughter when
their private plane crashed between two houses Friday.
   The two houses went up in flames, but their occupants escaped
injury.
   Killed were pilot Michael Spear, 49, president of The Rouse Co.,
his wife, Judy, 47, and their 19-year-old daughter, Jodi, police
said.
   The company's projects include Boston's Faneuil Hall shopping
area, Harbor Place on the Baltimore waterfront, South Street
Seaport in New York and Underground Atlanta.
   ``This is a terrible loss to the Rouse Co. and to the country,''
said James W. Rouse, retired founder of the Columbia, Md.-based
company. ``Mike Spear was a brilliant, compassionate, wise man. His
leadership was tremendous. In many respects, he is irreplaceble.
Judy was a wonderful woman who made a great contribution in her own
right, as well as to Mike's work.''
   The Spears lived in Columbia, Md., but had a summer home in
Chatham on Cape Cod.
   Spear joined Rouse in 1967 as director of market research and
project evaluation. From 1971 to 1978, he was general manager of
the Columbia project that established the planned city between
Baltimore and Washington. Spear was named executive vice president
for development in 1978. He became president in 1986. He and his
wife had three other daughters.
   Federal officials are investigating the cause of the crash.
   The plane went down on a dead-end street in the city's Mattapan
section. The small white airplane crashed into a driveway between
two houses, incinerating two parked cars and setting the houses on
fire.
   Spear left foggy Cape Cod around 6 a.m. in his two-engine
Cheyenne turboprop, bound for Logan International Airport. His
daughter was to fly from there to Tokyo, where she planned to study
this fall, said a friend of the family.
   The aircraft was 20 miles from Logan when Spear reported engine
trouble, said Michael Ciccarelli, spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration. About seven miles from the airport he
began efforts to land.
   Spear first reported lack of speed, then smoke, then that an
engine was out. At 6:30 a.m. the plane disappeared from the radar
screen. Visibility was one-quarter of a mile, said FAA spokeswoman
Gail Lattrell.
   People in the neighborhood said they heard a low-flying
aircraft, the sound of an engine cutting out and then a thud as the
plane hit the ground.
   ``I was in bed, not asleep, when I heard this tremendous
explosion,'' said Neal Silver, 66, who lives a few houses from the
crash site. ``My neighbors were pounding on the door. I looked out
and I could see these whole two buildings engulfed in flames.''
   Neighbors poured into the street as thick black smoke billowed
to the sky.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn sent dispatched teams of post-trauma experts
to the neighborhood to help people there deal with the disaster.
   The Red Cross and other agencies offered emergency assistance to
the displaced families.
