   Your Aug. 31 editorial "Get Me Off the Plane on Time" was a thoughtful analysis of key aspects of the problem of flight delays. 
American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall has advocated a national study of how much airspace capacity exists followed by a program to allocate it -- such as a "slot" system -- until the capacity to handle more traffic is increased. 

   On the subject of computer reservations systems, you hit the nail on the head. 
The 1984 rules governing the operation of CRS systems led to publication of unrealistic schedules by the airlines to get better screen positions. 
This resulted in more delays and a lot of passenger frustration. 
In retrospect, it is clear that such government interference in CRS systems was counterproductive.

   You make the point that differential landing fees to dissuade small planes from using principal airports at peak traffic hours would significantly improve the performance of the commercial aviation network. 
But you overlook certain facts. 

   In most hub airports, small plane operators already avoid peak hours simply because of the complication of landing and taking off at those times. 
Consequently the proposal would not have quite the significant effect that you see for it. 
Even to the extent that there are benefits to the traveling public, there would be corresponding damages to those living near airports, who would be subjected to even more intrusive airport noise of larger aircraft. 

   Finally, there is an important legal issue that may overshadow all other questions. 
When, some 25 years ago, air traffic began to be significant in this country, property owners near airports sued the federal government, their argument being that air rights and rights to privacy from noise intrusion were being taken without compensation. 
The case was lost, the court holding that the nation had the right to pre-empt airspace for the good of "aviation" as a whole. 
Whether this position is constitutional has never been challenged. 

   If the FAA should discriminate against private aircraft, then the pre-emption of airspace near airports is no longer in the interest of "aviation" at large but instead in the interest only of air travelers and the giant airline corporations. 
The government might, therefore, find itself in the precarious position of having to give back air rights to owners on the ground and to allow them to sell their rights for what they would bring on the open market. 

   The solution to the problem of airport congestion is the construction of modern, compatible airports.
