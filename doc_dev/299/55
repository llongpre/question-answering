   An American Airlines flight carrying 165 people
returned to Logan Airport for an emergency landing this morning
when smoke was detected in a rear cargo bin, airport officials said.
   Passengers and crew used emergency ramps to flee the aircraft
after it returned without incident about five minutes after takeoff
on a flight bound for Los Angeles, said spokesman Maynard
Scarborough of Massport, which operates the airport.
   Four people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation and
were taken to hospitals, said Scarborough. The 156 passengers
included four infants; nine crew members were also aboard, he said.
   The indication of smoke was detected just after the plane left
Logan, and it immediately returned, landing at 9:23 a.m.
   Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline, said she didn't
know what might have gone wrong after the Airbus A-300 plane took
off. ``This is a very reliable aircraft ... and is less than two
years old,'' she said.
