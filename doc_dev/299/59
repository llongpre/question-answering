   A 20-year-old student pilot reported engine
failure and indicated she would make an emergency landing minutes
before her plane spiraled and crashed Monday, killing her.
   Cache County Sheriff's Deputy Dave Tarbet identified the victim
as Ann Marie Kowallis of Providence.
   He said Kowallis had taken off from the Logan-Cache Airport in a
Cessna 152 at about 10:45 a.m. and crashed about a half mile north
of the airport.
   The single-engine Cessa 152 was leased for flight training by
Logan Air Service, where Kowallis was taking instruction. She was
qualified for solo flight, Tarbet said.
   Shortly after Kowallis took off, she reported ``engine failure,
emergency landing,'' then radio contact was lost, said Logan Air
Service office manager Kena Nelson.
   The Federal Aviation Adminstration is investigating the accident.
