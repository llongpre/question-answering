   The Federal Aviation Administration plans to
accelerate the certification of fixed-wing aircraft capable of
taking off and landing vertically so they might be available for
civilian use by the mid-1990s, officials said Friday.
   The so-called tilt-rotor aircraft technology, which is under
development by the military, is seen by some aviation industry
experts as a key to providing short-haul air transportation in the
future.
   FAA Adminstrator Allan McAtor, one of the government's chief
boosters of the technology, told reporters Friday that the
potential civilian uses for the tilt-rotor aircraft is virtually
limitless.
   He suggested it would be ideal for short-haul flights in areas
ranging from the congested skies of the Northeast and Southern
California to the isolated airfields of Alaska.
   Other aviation experts, however, suggest that the use of such
planes, which are expected to cost at least $20 million apiece and
carry only 24 to 30 people per flight, would be too high to be
economically successful in the near future.
   The tilt-rotor aircraft is envisioned as being capable of
landing and taking off like a helicopter and having a range of more
than 300 miles when its rotors are tilted for fixed-wing flight.
   McArtor said the FAA has entered into a memorandum of
understanding with the Defense Department to share development
information on the tilt-rotor aircraft program so that once the
military version is developed it may be adapted quickly for
civilian use.
   FAA officials estimated the agreement will shorten the time it
takes to certify such a plane for civilian use by as much as eight
years. McArtor estimated that the military version will be ready
for certification by 1992 and the civilian version three years
later.
   Six prototypes of the tilt-rotor craft already have been built
for the Defense Department by an industry team that includes Bell
Helicopter Textron, Boeing Helicopter and Allison Engine Division
of General Motors, officials said.
   The FAA also announced that it has awarded the Port Authority of
New York-New Jersey a $585,000 grant to conduct a study that would
determine where best to locate special landing and takeoff sites
for such aircraft. Additional grants are expected to be provided
shortly in other parts of the country, McArtor said.
   Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority,
estimated that as many as 8 million business travelers might use
such an aircraft annually if routes are established that would take
them from the downtowns of one city to another.
   FAA officials acknowledged more studies will be needed to
determine the actual market potential, the cost per seat mile of
such aircraft and how such aircraft would be integrated into the
next century's air transportation system.
   Eventually, FAA planners envision tilt-rotor aircraft being used
extensively by commuter airlines to transport business travelers in
areas where capacity at conventional airports is increasingly
limited.
   In the Northeast, says Joseph Del Balzo, the FAA's regional
administrator in New York, a tilt-rotor aircraft eventually could
take business travelers from downtown Manhattan to downtown
Washington in 45 minutes.
