   A federal appeals panel in Florida has ordered a
lower court to reconsider Eastern Airlines' request that pilots be
ordered back to work as a strike against the carrier enters its
fourth week.
   In another development, the trustee of the New York bankruptcy
court hearing the Eastern case, Harry Jones, said Friday he was
conducting a careful search for a bankruptcy examiner.
   The Miami Herald reported in today's editions that Jones said he
was looking for someone U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R.
Lifland ``knows and trusts'' to mediate disputes among Eastern's
management and unions, investigate the airline's sale of Eastern
assets to parent Texas Air Corp. and report back to the judge and
Jones.
   Also Friday, Lifland extended his order that other airlines
honor agreements on ticket, baggage and cargo transfers Eastern
badly needs to keep its few remaining flights in operation; he
barred striking Machinists from picketing on the sidewalk in front
of Eastern's terminal at Boston's Logan International Airport; and
flight attendants at Eastern's sister carrier Continental Airlines
ended a four-day strike that had little apparent effect.
   The developments came on the 21st day of the strike by Eastern's
8,500-member machinists union, which has been honored by most of
the airline's pilots and flight attendants.
   Of Eastern's prestrike daily roster of 1,040 flights, about 10
percent are still running _ all on the airline's Northeast shuttle
and Latin American routes.
   In Tallahassee, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told U.S.
District Judge Edward Davis in Miami to hold new hearings to
determine whether the walkout by Eastern's 3,600 pilots is a
sympathy strike, as the pilots claim _ or a de facto pilots strike
seeking its own aims, as Eastern management contends.
   Eastern had asked the appeals court to overturn Davis' earlier
ruling permitting the Air Line Pilots Association to honor the
machinists' pickets under the Railway Labor Act of 1926.
   ``A claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext to
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the
Railway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.
   The ruling called on Davis to report back to the appeals court
after his hearings on the issue.
   A statement issued by Eastern said that if Davis finds the
pilots union has stayed off the job primarily to pursue its own
bargaining objectives, ``the court would be expected to order them
back to work.''
   The pilots said they were satisfied with the ruling.
   ``The appeals court denied Eastern's request for an immediate
injunction and the lawful pilots sympathy strike shall continue,''
an a pilots' union statement said.
   After cutting fares on its Northeast shuttle service linking
Boston, New York and Washington to as low as $12 to combat the
strike, Eastern on Friday raised ticket prices on those runs to
their original $99 daily and $69 weekend fares.
   In New York, Lifland granted a two-week extension to an order
that competitors honor interline agreements, after Eastern
attorneys said the carrier's few remaining services would be
crippled without cooperation from other airlines.
   Lifland's order barring Eastern machinists' picketing on a
150-yard-long sidewalk in front of Eastern's terminal at Logan
International Airport followed the airline's complaint that
Machinists were trespassing on private property.
   But Lifland also said his court could not _ and would not _ bar
picketing altogether. He said he only wanted to ensure the strikers
remained in authorized areas.
   In Houston, Texas, spokeswoman Myra Clayton of the Union of
Flight Attendants said the union notifed Continental flight
attendants to return to work.
   No flights were disrupted or canceled because of the walkout,
Continental said. The airline claimed only 200 light attendants
took part in the walkout, while the union claimed more than 1,200
of their members struck.
   The 6,000-member union called the walkout Monday to protest what
it said were substandard wages and working conditions.
