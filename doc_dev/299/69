<TEXT>     The interruption originated at an American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
digital transmission facility in Blackstone, southwest of Boston, AT&amp;T
spokesman Paul Karoff said.;   About 60 percent of all long-distance calls
placed through AT&amp;T out of New England were blocked, Karoff said.;   The
outage affected communication between airports and airplanes, causing slight
delays at Logan International Airport in Boston, said Mike Ciccarelli, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.;   In September, a power
failure at an AT&amp;T switching center virtually closed the New York area's three
major airports for several hours, snarling air traffic across the nation.  </TEXT>
