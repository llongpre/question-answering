<LEADPARA>  THERE may be slightly fewer rush-hour flights -- and consequently fewer and
shorter delays -- at some major airports, following the Transportation
Department's suggestion last month that congested airports impose surcharges
on planes using the runways at the busiest times of day.;   The question for
travelers is whether the new guidelines will also mean much higher ticket
prices for those who take off or land at busy times of day.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The department's proposed "peak hour" surcharges would mainly affect
flights in the early morning and early evening. The idea is that the high
costs would encourage airlines to divert flights to other time slots,
smoothing out the flow of traffic and cutting down on delays. Officials said
that even shifting a handful of flights can make a substantial difference in
delays.;   The department is not requiring this change. It is merely outlining
for airports what kinds of charges would not be viewed as discriminatory or as
impeding interstate commerce and thus be acceptable to the government. Some
airports officials have said that only the assumption of government opposition
was preventing them from imposing rush-hour charges.;   Because the fees would
be divided among hundreds of passengers on large jets, according to Clifford
Winston, an airline economist at the Brookings Institution who has advocated
such charges, they might amount to only $10 a ticket, probably not enough to
make those customers change their flying times. After all, as the airlines
point out, ticket prices already tend to be discounted in non-peak periods.;  
But when applied to small planes, such as those used by commuter airlines, the
fees might prevent flying at rush hour, Winston said. For most private pilots
and users of corporate jets, the extra fees would be prohibitive. With the
smaller planes out of the way, he said, the flow of heavier jets should be
much smoother.  </TEXT>
