FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Business flights may use
RAF base - Airports

The government is considering allowing business and general aircraft to use
the Royal Air Force airfield at Northolt, west London.
The white paper said the government would seek views for developing civil
aviation at the RAF airfield because of the increasing pressure on
facilities for general and business aviation in south-east England.
BAA, the airports operator, said it would welcome a move to transfer general
aviation and business services from nearby Heathrow to Northolt as long as
it was beneficial to all.
Heathrow airport is heavily congested, and take-off and landing slots have
become a rare commodity. Slots are granted to business users at Heathrow
only if they are not required by commercial airlines, or if an airliner
fails to show up.
An additional problem is that a small jet takes up two slots so as not to be
caught up in the slipstream of larger aircraft.
BAA also sought to discourage business jets using Heathrow at peak times by
charging a small aircraft the same landing fees as a 400-seater jumbo during
busy periods. This has led to a 7 per cent fall in the number of business
aircraft flights into Heathrow between 1992 and 1993.
There are also proposals to transfer the Queen's flight from RAF Benson in
Oxfordshire to Northolt, which already serves as a base for VIP flights for
royalty and government officials.
Plans to expand civil aircraft services at Northolt are expected to spark
fierce local opposition on the grounds of noise.
