   A TWA jetliner with 114 passengers aboard lost
hydraulic power Saturday shortly after takeoff, and its pilot had to
lower the landing gear by hand when it returned to Lambert Airport,
an airline official said.
   In other incidents, a Northwest Airlines jumbo jet experienced a
loss of oil pressure after leaving Honolulu and another Northwest
aircraft lost power in one of two engines en route to Chicago,
officials said.
   All three planes landed safely, as did an American Airlines jet
that was diverted to Boston after losing one of its hydraulic
systems.
   In St. Louis, Flight 203 to San Diego made a safe landing about
30 minutes after its 9:40 a.m. takeoff, said TWA spokesman Don
Morrison. The pilot of the Boeing 737 reported a loss in hydraulic
power to the main landing gear, Morrison said.
   ``He manually lowered the gear, and landed routinely,'' Morrison
said.
   The 114 passengers were placed on other flights. The airplane was
back in service about 3{ hours later after workers replaced the
hydraulic line, Morrison said.
   On Friday, a TWA jet returned safely to Lambert after one of its
engines failed. A piece of the engine fell through the roof of an
auto-body shop, narrowly missing the store's manager.
   A Northwest Airlines Boeing 747 returned to Honolulu after it
started losing oil pressure in an engine shortly after taking off on
a flight to Osaka, Japan, an airline spokesman said.
   The flight, which had 400 passengers and 14 crew members aboard,
returned at 8:25 a.m., Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said by
telephone from Minneapolis, where the airline is based.
   A Northwest Boeing 757 flying from Detroit to Chicago landed at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after one of its two engines
shut down, Gibbons said. Fifty-six passengers and crew were aboard
the plane.
   An American Airlines Boeing 727 flying from Providence, R.I., to
Raleigh, N.C., with 83 passengers and a crew of seven aboard was
diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston after the
hydraulic system that controlled the plane's landing gear failed,
officials said.
   The pilot was able to switch to a backup system, and the plane
landed safely shortly after 2 p.m.
   The loss of the hydraulic system was caused by a valve
malfunction, said airlines spokeswoman Mary O'Neill.
   On July 19, a United Airlines DC-10 lost its hydraulic system and
its pilot was unable to use the landing gear when he brought the
plane down in Sioux City, Iowa. Flight 232 touched down, cartwheeled
and burst into flames, killing 111 of the 296 people aboard.
