   Since the nation's airline industry was
deregulated in October 1978, a debate has raged on the benefits and
problems created by the move.
   Among the main benefits, according to supporters and industry
experts:
   _A ``democratization'' of air travel, formerly the domain of
relatively few Americans. The number of passengers on U.S. airlines
jumped to around 455 million last year from 275 million in 1978. By
the year 2000, that traffic is widely projected to surge to 800
million or 900 million people.
   _With nine out of 10 air travelers flying on some sort of
discount fare, the average price of a plane ticket dropped 21
percent from 1978 to 1988 with inflation taken into account,
according to the Air Transport Association.
   _A planeload of passengers takes off from an airport somewhere
in the country on an average of every 4.8 seconds.
   _Several studies of airline deregulation contend that travelers
and the economy as a whole have benefited.
   The downside:
   _Growing complaints about the concentration of the industry
around a few ``mega-carriers'' and about the dominance they wield
in and out of some cities, and through links with commuter airlines
to entire regions of the country.
   _Unprecedented congestion at busy airports and in the skies
surrounding them, with some airport planners resorting to high
landing fees to keep out smaller aircraft.
   _Concerns about aviation safety. Critics both in and out of the
industry complain that the government is unable to keep up with
traffic growth and industry fluctuations to assure a continuing
high level of safety.
   _Predictions of catastrophe and re-regulation of the industry
unless airports are expanded, new airports are built and the air
traffic control system is modernized.
   _Complaints that airline service continues to deteriorate,
especially in rural areas, while prices are allowed to soar
unfairly high in some markets, especially between busy ``hub''
airports dominated by one or two airlines.
   _A realization that the days of aviation entrepreneurs starting
an airline from scratch and taking on the competition have long
passed, the victim of the same ``mega-carriers.''
