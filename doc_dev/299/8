   A federal appeals court here confirmed that Boston's Logan International Airport can't reduce congestion by raising landing fees for smaller planes. 

   The Transportation Department last year found that the scheme violates federal law. 
The Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns Logan Airport, had appealed. 

   The plan, adopted last year, raised landing fees for commuter flights and private planes and lowered them for airliners. 
The fee structure was geared to encourage commuter airlines to use larger aircraft and private pilots to use other airports. 

   According to the Massachusetts Port Authority, the scheme worked. 
While the new fee structure was in place, Logan Airport climbed to rank No. 2 in the nation in terms of on-time arrivals. 
After the program was rescinded in January, following the Department of Transportation ruling, the airport's ranking in that category dropped to No. 22, the authority said. 

   The appeals court decision "was a setback, but it was not a roadblock" to reducing airport congestion, said David W. Davis, executive director of the Massachusetts Port Authority. 
He said the authority hopes to work with "the new leadership at the Department of Transportation" to deal with the problems. 

   The authority said a decision hasn't been made on whether it will appeal the latest ruling.
