   A commuter plane with seven people aboard
landed safely at Gadsden Municipal Airport after a collision with a
smaller plane that killed two other people, authorities said.
   The Atlantic Southeast Airlines plane was en route to Atlanta
when the crash with a single-engine Cessna 172 Skyhawk occurred
Monday at an altitude of 2,100 feet, said Arlene Salac, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   The smaller plane, with two Civil Air Patrol pilots aboard,
plunged into a field after the collision, which occurred about
three miles southwest of Gadsden.
   Both pilots died. They were identified as Thomas Frondorf, 59,
of Ashville, and Marvin Charles Moffett, 46, of Southside.
   The tail section of the larger craft, a Brazilian-made Embraer
turbo-prop, was damaged in the collision, but it landed safely,
said Fred Anderton Jr., manager of the airport in this city about
50 miles northeast of Birmingham.
   ``I don't know how he ever got it down. Part of the tail was
torn off,'' Anderton said. ``The pilot, to control an aircraft with
that amount of control surface torn from the aircraft, did a
remarkable job.''
   The turbo-prop had three crew members and four passengers.
   Bob Cote of Counce, Tenn., who was one of the passengers, said
he heard a loud bang. ``It sounded like a cannon shot when it
hit,'' he said.
   Witness Vernon Stephenson of Gadsden said the Cessna was flying
west into the sun when it collided with the ASA plane, which was
traveling east.
   ``It went straight down, spinning,'' Stephenson said.
   Sam Watts, vice president of customer services for ASA, said the
names of commuter line's crew members were being withheld during an
investigation of the collision.
   On Nov. 5, four people died when two planes collided about 300
feet above the intersecting runways at the Gadsden airport, which
does not have a control tower.
