   Planes landing at the Lebanon Regional
Airport are using the Federal Aviation Administration's new class
of microwave landing systems, the first of 250 to be installed by
the FAA around the country.
   ``It's much simpler, it doesn't take as much space on the
ground, and we hope it's going to be even more accurate than the
old'' instrument-landing system, Harold Buker, the state
aeronautics director, said Thursday after the FAA inaugurated the
Microwave Landing System.
   ``I foresee greater reliability for airport oprerations and an
increase in safety,'' said Marcel Theberge, manager of the
city-owned airport.
   The FAA has received congressional approval to install 250
Microwave Landing Systems throughout the country in the next 10
years. The Lebanon airport was first partly because of the hilly
terrain and because landing patterns are limited, Buker said.
   ``With the old system, we can fly only one line directly into
the field,'' Buker said. ``This will let us fly in from different
directions.'' In addition to spreading out flight patterns, which
will ease noise problems, the system promises to reduce radio
interference problems that hamper growth in the old
instrument-landing systems; and to increase airport landing
capacity.
   While the Lebanon installation was the first by the FAA, the
system has been in use at a handful of private airports around the
country.
   Authorities expect it will be a least a decade before airplanes
routinely operate with the new type of radio beacon, which uses
microwaves or precise guiding onto runways in bad weather.
   The major airlines have not endorsed the system, but have agreed
to a cooperative study with the FAA. Airline officials say it will
cost more than $250,000 on each airplane they equip to use it.
   The program has been welcomed by smaller commuter airlines,
which typically serve airports like Lebanon, where service can be
impeded by short runways, bad weather and hilly terrain. Lebanon is
about 60 miles north of Concord near the Vermont border.
   Theberge said the older instrument-landing systems take up four
buildings and ``quite a bit of land,'' while the new system needs
two buildings at the airport.
   Lebanon Regional Airport is a commuter airport that, until
Precision Airlines temporarily halted service, had about 16 flights
a day to Boston, New York, Hartford, Conn., Albany, N.Y., and other
regional airports. Currently, Business Express is the sole airline
using the field.
