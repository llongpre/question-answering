   Angry travelers at Memphis International Airport staged a protest over the Christmas holiday after their Florida-bound flight was first delayed, then canceled. 
Not even the threat of arrest could quiet the protesters, who were only calmed by a promise of a charter flight. 

   While such airport dramas are exceptional, flight delays and cancellations are becoming more commonplace, and not just during holidays. 
The Federal Aviation Administration reports a 25% increase in late flights this year. 
Airlines squander an average of 2,000 hours a day, at a loss of an estimated $1 billion a year. 

   On the eve of one of the busiest travel weekends of the year, Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) vowed to introduce legislation to reduce airline delays. 
He would reserve a portion of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund's $4.3 billion surplus to increase the capacity of the nation's more congested airports, and to attract more air traffic to secondary airports and away from the larger hubs. 

   Airlines are only partly responsible for delays. 
The Federal Aviation Administration has been slow to respond to the 60% increase in air traffic since the airline industry was decontrolled in 1978. 

   Consider the FAA's recent lottery for landing slots at four of the busiest airports (New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy, Chicago's O'Hare, and Washington's National). 
The landing slots could have been rationed by price. 
The FAA could have conducted an auction among the various airlines and other interested bidders for peak and non-peak landing slots. 

   But the FAA did not do that. 
It apportioned roughly 60% of landing slots (both peak and non-peak) to airlines, and the remaining 40% to commuter lines and corporate and other general-aviation craft. 
While the agency permits airlines to buy and sell landing slots among themselves, it does not permit them to barter with the commuters and private owners. 

   The inefficiency of such a system is obvious. 
It deprives airlines of desperately needed landing slots and allows small planes to fly into congested hubs rather than fly to secondary airports. 

   The FAA's lottery also transfers valuable assets to airlines at no cost. 
With landing slots valued at about $400,000 at National, $300,000 at O'Hare, $200,000 at LaGuardia and $100,000 at Kennedy, the FAA could have raised several billion dollars for improvements in the nation's system for handling air traffic. 

   A market solution for air-traffic congestion is to establish the number of flights that can be accommodated at a given airport at a given time, fix the number of landing slots and auction off landing slots to the highest bidders. 
Landing slots during peak hours would fetch the highest prices, and nonessential flights would be relegated to non-peak hours. 
Of course, there still would be flight delays attributable to bad weather and mechanical failures. 
But economic efficiency would be better served, the airlines would be able to pass along the cost of traveling peak hours to their passengers if they wished and more air travelers would get to their destinations on time.
