   In writing of needed additional airport capacity (editorial, Dec. 30) you referred to inefficiency of the current system in which airlines, commuter airlines and general aviation aircraft share the same airport. 
You concluded: "It deprives airlines of desperately needed landing slots and allows small planes to fly into congested hubs rather than fly to secondary airports." 

   Your rationale is flawed because it is based on an implied premise that suitable secondary airports are available. 
There is in fact a dire and increasing shortage of general-aviation airports to serve metropolitan areas. 
Here in California alone, public-use general-aviation airports are being closed at the rate of 3 1/2 each year despite our best efforts to keep them open. 

   Your editorial reflects a widespread general philosophical bias in favor of airline operation over general aviation. 
This is because the benefits which general-aviation aircraft provide are not widely known. 
Some 75% to 80% of general-aviation flying has as its purpose revenue-production or performance of a public service. 

   Use of general aviation for business transportation has increased substantially as a result of airline unreliability. 
An article by reporter Randall Smith, in the issue of the Journal in which your editorial appeared, referred to an industry survey showing that corporations utilizing general-aviation aircraft have a greater return on equity. 

   While airlines provide mass transportation, general aviation provides strategic transportation. 
There is a need to accommodate both without undue preference.
