   A Navy pilot making his first landing
attempt on an aircraft carrier was ``low and slow'' before his
training jet crashed on the USS Lexington, killing him and four
others, the ship's captain said Monday.
   The T-2 Buckeye slammed into the ship's island, the tower-like
part of the ship which also was hit by a kamikaze plane in World
War II, before cartwheeling across the deck and exploding in flames
Sunday afternoon, said Capt. C. Flack Logan.
   ``It looked like a battle zone. There were pieces of aircraft
and of metal all over the place. Bodies were spread throughout
different areas,'' Lt. Bruce Adams, a physician and the ship's
medical officer, said after the Lexington returned to its dock late
Monday morning.
   In addition to the five dead, 19 people were injured, Logan said.
   The pilot, Ensign Steven E. Pontell, 23, of Columbia, Md., was
the only one aboard the two-seat trainer, a normal situation when
aviators make their first carrier landings, Logan said. Pontell, a
1988 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., was a
member of Training Squadron 19 at Meridian, Miss., Naval Air
Station.
   The Navy identified the other dead as Petty Officer 3rd Class
Burnett Kilgore Jr., 19, of Holly Springs, Miss.; Petty Officer 3rd
Class Timmy L. Garroutte, 30, of Memphis, Tenn.; and Airman Lisa L.
Mayo, 25, of Oklahoma City, all Lexington crew members; and Byron
Gervis Courvelle, 32, of Meridian, Miss., a civilian employee of
DynCorp which has a contract to maintain Navy aircraft. The four
were on the flight deck, officials said.
   In another accident involving a Navy vessel, a U.S. warplane
accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided-missile crusier
USS Reeves during maneuvers Monday in the Indian Ocean. The bomb
left a 5-foot hole in the ship's main deck and five sailors were
slightly injured, the Navy said.
   The Lexington was steaming in the Gulf of Mexico in clear
weather about 30 miles south of its home port here when the jet
crashed.
   ``As I see it,'' Logan said, ``he ended up in a position which
in naval aviation is known as being low and slow, which is a very
terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a ship.''
   Landing signal officers radioed the pilot to add power and waved
him off, but he did not comply, Logan said. He said an
investigation would try to explain why.
   ``The nose pitched up, and he lost control of his ability to fly
the aircraft, and it went up and came into the island,'' the
captain said.
   The plane flipped upside down before a wing tip hit the island
just below the control tower, the captain said. The wing tip broke
off and remained embedded in the superstructure when the Lexington
docked Monday.
   The jet's fuselage then smashed into the side of the island, but
the ship showed little evidence of the accident other than the
wreckage of the plane, still upside down, covered with orange and
white parachutes.
   It hit at the feet of Airman Dee Votolato, 21, of Houma, La.,
who was inside a glassed-in area operating a video camera used to
tape all landings.
   The Lexington is the Navy's oldest carrier, its only one used
exclusively for training and the only one with women aboard.
   The impact knocked Votolato to the floor, but she got back up
and pointed her camera at the flight deck in time to capture the
plane bursting into flames.
   Airman Darrell Gurley of Indianapolis was directing crew members
on the deck where to park planes as they landed.
   ``He was headed straight for us,'' Gurley said. ``I turned and
there was just a great boom. It shook me and I buckled down, but I
knew I had to get out the door because the flames were coming right
for my station. I knew I would be wiped out so I took off running.''
   Gurley, his arm in a sling, said a piece of metal had hit him in
the back. He made it inside the island only to discover his shirt
was on fire. He took it off, put out the flames, put it back on and
joined firefighting efforts.
   Pieces of the plane struck three other parked jets, but Logan
said it appeared all three can be repaired.
   Pilots in the other three planes jettisoned their canopies and
clambered out, Logan said.
   Airplanes normally land on the Lexington's 910-foot, blacktop
flight deck at about 110 to 120 knots, or up to 138 mph, said Cmdr.
Denny Major, the ship's air officer. They stop by catching their
tailhooks on cables stretched across the 192-foot-wide deck.
Aircraft land on the stern of the ship.
   The crash occurred six days before the 45th anniversary of the
kamikaze attack that killed 47 crew members and injured 127 on Nov.
4, 1944.
