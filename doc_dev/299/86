<LEADPARA>  Federal safety officials and other witnesses Monday blasted the government's
slow-paced modernization of the nation's air traffic control system, saying
lives are at risk in the air and on the ground.;    Mayor Tom Bradley
criticized the Bush administration for using a $7 billion aviation trust fund
to balance the budget at the expense of passenger safety.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     People 'placed in danger';    "We cannot balance the budget of this nation
with the lives of the people who are placed in danger," Bradley told a hearing
of the House Government Activities and Transportation Subcommittee at Los
Angeles International Airport.;    Money from the trust fund, which pays for
such improvements as new radar, has been tied up by the federal budget
deficit. Originally intended to pay for airport capital projects, the fund has
bankrolled operating expenses.;    Spending the funds properly could prevent
the kind of runway collision that killed 34 people at the airport on Feb. 1,
Bradley told the committee.;    The hearing, chaired by Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-San Rafael, also looked at a runway collision at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport on Dec. 3 that killed eight people.;    "Two hundred-forty runway
incursions in a year is just not acceptable," Boxer said. The FAA defines an
incursion as a ground collision hazard.;    "Incidents like the LAX collision
always appear random at first, like bolts from the blue or acts of God, but
upon closer examination the pattern of unfortunate trends and occurrences
emerges," Boxer said.;    The LAX collision occurred when an air traffic
controller allowed a USAir jet to land after clearing a Skywest commuter plane
for takeoff on the same runway.;    National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) investigators said most of the 22 people who died in the USAir jet
survived the collision but died trying to escape smoke and fire in the cabin.;
   The NTSB found that a 20-year-old ground radar system at LAX was not
working and that the USAir jet cabin was not equipped with advanced fire
retardant materials.;    Matthew McCormic, chief of the NTSB's survival
factors division, testified the materials must be installed on all new
aircraft, but on older aircraft only when they are refurbished.;    That could
take up to seven years, NTSB official Richard Wentworth said. He added that
over the last eight years, LAX has been second only to Boston's Logan
International Airport in the number of runway incursions.;    In written
testimony, the NTSB said the best way to prevent ground collisions is to
install advanced radar and other equipment that alerts controllers and pilots
about impending collisions.;    Boxer noted that LAX's ground radar hadn't
been functioning for most of the three months before the runway collision.;   
New system being tested;    FAA official Joseph Del Balzo, who declined to
comment on the LAX or Detroit accidents, said the FAA is testing an advanced
new ground radar system in Pittsburgh.;    But technical problems have delayed
its installation by four years, he testified. The system won't be working at
LAX and Detroit until October 1992, he said.;    The LAX ground radar system
goes down for lengthy periods of time while officials seek spare parts or
cannibalize other equipment, Del Balzo said.;    Less-sophisticated ground
radar systems at 13 other major airports fail roughly once every eight days,
Del Balzo added.;    "I believe we have a very safe air transportation system
in the United States . . . but the system isn't perfect," Del Balzo said.;   
Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of the Association of Flight Attendants,
criticized the FAA for failing to make it easier to escape airplane window
exits.;    Subcommittee members called on the Bush administration to
appropriate the aviation trust funds.;    "To me, virtually all of the deaths
on the USAir plane were preventable and never should have occurred," said Rep.
Mel Levine, D-Los Angeles.  </TEXT>
