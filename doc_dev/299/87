<LEADPARA>  For the second time in two months, a commuter airline affiliated with
Northwest Airlines has refused to let a member of a presidential committee
board because he uses a wheelchair.;   Rick Douglas, executive director of the
President's Committee on the Employment of People with Disabilities, said
Friday he was blocked from boarding a commuter aircraft in Manchester, N.H.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Douglas, who has multiple sclerosis, said he was told by the employees of
Precision Airlines that he could not get on the plane unless he could walk.;  
Officials of the airline acknowledged that Douglas was barred from the
aircraft Thursday, but said their decision was required by federal law.;   "If
you can't walk up and down the stairs, you are a danger to yourself and a
safety hazard," Douglas quoted the airplane's pilot, Ernest Marino, as having
said.;   Douglas was trying to fly to Boston to connect with a Northwest
Airlines flight to Washington. Instead, he flew by United Airlines, although
this flight arrived at Dulles Airport, in suburban Virginia, rather than
National Airport close to downtown Washington.;   "I'm still stunned," Douglas
said.;   In August, Justin Dart, chairman of the president's committee on
disabilities, and an assistant were barred from a commuter flight by Masaba
Airlines in Minneapolis.;   In both cases, the commuter airlines were
operating under the name Northwest Airlink and had agreements with Northwest
Airlines to provide service between small airports and larger hubs.;   John
Gallichon, executive vice president of Precision Airlines, said federal law
forbids airline personnel from carrying a disabled person by hand onto an
aircraft that seats 30 passengers or fewer.;   He added many commuter aircraft
are boarded by a stairway built into the door that often cannot support more
than one person.;   But Gallichon appears to be misinterpreting a federal law
that forbids commercial airlines from refusing to fly people with physical and
mental disabilities, said Diana Lundie, director of industry activities for
the Regional Airline Association, a trade group for commuter airlines.;  
While the law does not require that disabled passengers be carried onto
aircraft that fly 30 passengers or fewer, neither does the law forbid such
assistance, she said.;   The exception for the smaller aircraft stands only
until hydraulic lifts and wheelchairs for smaller planes become available.  </TEXT>
