   Owners of small aircraft and several members of
Congress are trying to get the government to reconsider a new rule
that leaves thousands of planes with no place to land near the
nation's biggest cities.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said the order requiring
altitude signalling devices on all planes flying within 30 miles of
the most congested airports ``should significantly reduce the danger
of midair collisions.'' The FAA rule took effect Saturday.
   But pilots and small plane owners say it will clutter air traffic
control screens, effectively bar 40,000 planes from 1,200 airports
near big cities, and do nothing to enhance safety.
   Under the rule, only planes carrying Mode C transponders can fly
within 30 miles of the nation's 27 most congested airports. Mode C
sends a signal telling air traffic controllers where the plane is
and at what altitude.
   The transponders have always been required for planes that use
major airports, but they have not previously been required for
low-altitude flights past the airports or for access to smaller
general aviation airports that fall within the 30-mile ``veils.''
   Patricia Weil, spokeswoman for the 290,000-member Aircraft Owners
and Pilots Association, said the order will effectively put
off-limits to non-Mode C planes all the airports in the Los Angeles
basin, scores of public and private airports and helipads around
Washington, D.C., and hundreds of airports near other cities that
serve vital business and medical air traffic.
   ``We can no longer fly under the wedding cake,'' Ms. Weil said,
referring to the air traffic control rules that previously allowed
small planes to fly within progressively lower altitudes as they get
nearer major airports, like flying under an inverted wedding cake.
   Jerry Walbrun of the 125,000-member Experimental Aircraft
Association of Oshkosh, Wisc., said the rule will overburden air
traffic controllers.
   ``It's a little bit like trying to use computers to control
traffic in downtown Washington,'' he said, adding that the traffic
control system is not geared to watch the scores of small planes
flying well below the altitude of major airliners.
   ``The FAA has imposed a situation that will not enhance safety
and put it into effect more quickly than their own system can
handle,'' he said.
   Many pilots are faced with the prospect of either spending from
$900 to $2,000 to equip their planes with Mode C or move their
airplanes to more-remote airports.
   The FAA, in justifying the new rule, said it ``will have a major
positive impact on safety by providing air traffic controllers with
vital altitude information so potential conflicts between aircraft
can be safely resolved.''
   But last week, 18 House members sent a letter to Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner calling for him to delay implementation of
the rule until provisions can be made for access to smaller airports
that fall within the veils.
   ``The fact is that safety does not require universal installment
of automatic altitude reporting transponders,'' the lawmakers said,
adding that government should not impose unnecessary regulations
that impose ``great cost on private individuals.''
   The Congress members said that if the Mode C requirement were
limited to areas around major airports that are reached by radar,
rather than the arbitrary 30-mile limit, it would open up 600 to 700
smaller general aviation airports.
   The FAA has exempted from the rule antique aircraft, balloons and
other aircraft without electrical systems necessary to run
transponders.
   The agency also acknowledged last week that many aircraft owners
may have postponed purchase of Mode C units awaiting the outcome of
an aircraft owners' challenge to the rule, which the FAA rejected
only two weeks ago.
   To accommodate them, 90-day exemptions are being granted over the
phone. Pilots who want to fly within a restricted area can call air
traffic control authorities at the individual airport to get the
exemptions.
   The FAA also indicated longer exemptions could be given for some
operators who regularly use airports on the fringes of the veil in
areas without radar coverage or for aircraft that cannot be equipped
to handle Mode C, but written requests are required.
   The transponder rule is to be extended to 111 additional airports
at the end of next year.
   Aviation maps printed by the Commerce Department already show the
forbidden zones, so pilots have known for some time where they won't
be able to fly.
