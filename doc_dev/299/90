   A man accused of strafing the city while flying a
stolen airplane bought an assault rifle after watching reports
about a California schoolyard massacre, a newspaper reported today.
   Albert J. Hunter, who allegedly killed his wife and commandeered
the plane Wednesday, bought a semiautomatic rifle on Jan. 17, the
same day killer Patrick E. Purdy went on a rampage in Stockton,
Calif., The Boston Globe reported.
   Witnesses have identified the gun as an AK-47, but ballistic
experts studying the casings recovered from the strafing had not
confirmed that.
   A person who answered the telephone at Bob's Tactical Shooting
Range and Gun Shop in Salisbury, where authorities said Hunter
bought the gun, said, ``I don't know anything about it,'' and hung
up, the Globe reported.
   Hunter, a Vietnam veteran and armored reconaissance specialist
in Germany, worked at the U.S. Postal Service's South Postal Annex
in Boston.
   A co-worker there, who refused to give his name, told the Globe
that Hunter was impressed by the carnage created by Purdy, who
sprayed the schoolyard with bullets from an AK-47, killing five
children and wounding 30 before committing suicide.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has sought to ban assault
rifles in the state, and was expected to use Wednesday's incident
to back up his cause.
   Police believe Hunter used the AK-47 to kill his ex-wife,
Elvira, and to commandeer a Cessna 152 from a flight instructor at
Beverly airport. They said he fired randomly down at the city
during a three-hour flight over greater Boston, hitting buildings
and airplanes parked at Logan International Airport.
   Hunter pleaded innocent to murder and assault charges after his
capture Wednesday, and was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for
20 days' psychiatric observation.
