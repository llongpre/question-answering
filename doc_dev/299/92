   A commuter jet that had just taken off
collided with a smaller plane Monday evening, killing the two
people aboard the smaller aircraft, authorities said.
   The pilot of the Atlantic Southeast Airlines jet, a
Brazilian-made Embraer, returned safely to Gadsden Municipal
Airport with his four passengers.
   The collision occurred around 6 p.m. shortly after the jet left
the northeastern Alabama airport for Atlanta, said Arlene Salac, a
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman in Atlanta. The jet and
the single-engine Cessna 182 collided at an altitude of 2,100 feet
and about three miles southwest of the airport.
   The two Civil Air Patrol pilots aboard the Cessna were killed,
said airport manager Fred Anderton. There were no injuries aboard
the commuter jet, whose tail was damaged in the crash.
   ``It looks like the ASA was flying out of Gadsden and was only
up to 2,100 feet when this little Cessna ... must have came in out
of the blue,'' Ms. Salac said.
   ``It sounded like a cannon shot when it hit,'' said Bob Cote of
Counce, Tenn., a passenger in the commuter jet. ``They never saw
the small plane.''
   On Nov. 5, four people died when two planes collided about 300
feet above the Gadsden airport, which does not have a control tower.
   Gadsden is about 50 miles northeast of Birmingham.
