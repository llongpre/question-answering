   After a Trump Shuttle jet made an emergency
landing without its front gear, owner Donald Trump flew to Boston
to thank the pilot and try to turn a near-disaster into a public
relations triumph.
   ``I think the whole crew is made up of heroes,'' the New York
real estate baron said, singling out Capt. Robert Smith as ``a
great talent.''
   There were no injuries among the 47 passengers and seven crew
members on the Boeing 727, which came screeching into Logan
International Airport on its belly Thursday morning and stopped in
a shower of sparks.
   Smith, 47, a former Navy pilot with 19 years of flying
experience, realized the plane's nose gear failed to extend as he
approached Logan from New York City at about 9:30 a.m.
   He tried to free the landing gear by diving and pulling up
suddenly, and then by making a rough touch-and-go landing _
slamming the main landing gear on the runway and then taking off.
   When both attempts failed, the jet circled for nearly an hour
and dumped fuel over the ocean before finally making a gentle but
ungainly landing, with its nose scraping the pavement.
   Smith played down his efforts. ``This was all in a day's work as
far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
   The emergency landing was the first major problem for Trump
since he bought the shuttle from strike-torn Eastern Airlines on
June 8. He quickly tried to turn any safety fears to his advantage.
   ``I think the public confidence might be greater right now,
because of the talent of our crews,'' Trump said.
   The landing resembled an Aug. 2 incident in which a Piedmont
Airlines 737 scraped its wing and engine in an emergency landing at
Greensboro, N.C., after its left main gear jammed. No one was
injured.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle, said the jet had been
in service since January 1970 and was scheduled for a major
overhaul next month.
   ``Age has nothing to do with it,'' Nobles said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the
incident.
