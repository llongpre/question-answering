   Inspections an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727s found a
fuselage crack in a jet in ``roughly the same area'' where a 14-inch
hole tore open in another plane, forcing an emergency landing, the
airline said today.
   Eastern officials in Boston said the Boeing 727 was grounded for
repairs at Logan International Airport after company inspectors
discovered the 3-inch crack in the fuselage Monday night.
   The airline ordered the inspections of its Boeing 727 fleet after
a 14-inch hole tore open in the fuselage of an Atlanta-bound 727 on
Monday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Charleston,
W.Va., when its cabin depressurized.
   ``We're doing it on our own,'' spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said
from Eastern's headquarters in Miami. ``It's just as a precautionary
measure following yesterday's incident. ... We know that Eastern
Airlines is safe. We hope that professionalism will prevail.''
   No problems were found in the other planes that were inspected,
she said today.
   On Tuesday, federal officials investigating the forced landing of
Atlanta-bound Flight 251 said the plane had problems maintaining
cabin pressure shortly after takeoff from Rochester, N.Y., before
the roof ripped open.
   ``By the time they reached 31,000 feet, they were able to
stabilize the pressure,'' although the hole in the fuselage soon
developed, said National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz.
   There was no indication what caused the initial problem, he said.
   A 5-inch crack had been found on the fuselage in an inspection in
July 1986, although the plane had been cleared to fly in an
inspection as recently as September, Federal Aviation Administration
officials said.
   On orders from Eastern, mechanics spent Monday night and Tuesday
inspecting 17 of the airline's 100-series 727s and 28 of the
200-series model.
   ``During the inspection of the 727s up in Boston, we uncovered a
727 that had a 3-inch crack in the crown,'' said airline spokesman
Robin Matell, who added that the crack was in ``roughly the same
area'' as the hole in the plane in Charleston.
   Executives of the financially troubled airline insist their
safety record is one of the industry's best, and blame disgrunted
labor union officials for suggesting Eastern has a safety problem.
The airline's unions complained this year that Eastern employees
were being pressured to bypass safety procedures.
   However, an investigation by the FAA, which included inspection
of every Eastern plane, reported the airline was safe, but expressed
concern over labor-management strife that could have ``an adverse
impact on the public safety.''
   On Sunday, an Eastern A300 bound for Newark, N.J., had to return
to Miami International Airport because of an engine problem. On
Tuesday, a Fort Lauderdale-bound Eastern A300 turned back to New
York's LaGuardia airport after a problem with a door prevented the
plane from being properly pressurized.
   Two NTSB representatives from Washington were in Charleston today
to examine the plane used on Flight 251. It could be six months
before a final determination is made on what happened, said NTSB
investigator Pamela Kleckner.
   ``A few investigators are still working on the plane,'' she said
today. ``It may not move until Thursday morning.''
   Ceremsak said that the jet would be temporarily repaired and then
will be flown to Atlanta, its original destination, or Miami, the
airline's headquarters.
   As federal investigators began the investigation, they also said:
   _ Records for the past five years show the plane had made seven
unscheduled landings in the last five years before this week, but
none could be called an emergency landing.
   _ The section of the fuselage that developed the hole was a
replacement part, not the original skin of the plane.
   _ The piece that peeled away would be taken to a laboratory for
metallurgical tests.
   Fred Farrar, the FAA's spokesman, said seven unplanned landings
in five years is not unusual for a 22-year-old airplane, and Bobbie
Mardis of the FAA's safety data branch in Oklahoma City said it was
not unusual for a plane to develop cracks like those on the 727.
   ``Inspectors do periodic inspections, and cracks are one of the
items they look for,'' she said. ``It's part of normal wear and
tear.''
