   Michael Dukakis applauded Republican rival George
Bush's statement that deployment of the costly ``Star Wars'' space
defense system should be contingent on further research, saying
Friday that ``I'm glad to see that the vice president now agrees
with me.''
   The Massachusetts governor spent Friday at the Statehouse, but
campaign aides said his time in the capital would soon begin
dwindling. They said Dukakis planned to spend only one full day in
Boston after Labor Day, devoting at least five days a week to
campaigning.
   Dukakis' only public event was a swearing-in ceremony for a new
member of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the agency that
oversees Logan International Airport, the Boston Fish Pier and
several roads and commerce centers.
   He was not scheduled to field questions from reporters. But he
responded when asked about Bush's comments, published in Friday's
editions of The New York Times, that the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the formal name for the space defense system, was
``very expensive'' and that deployment decisions should await
further research.
   Dukakis said the comments showed that Bush was backing away from
his earlier position, although the vice president said several
weeks ago that he would deploy the system as soon as it was
feasible.
   ``I think that makes sense,'' Dukakis said of Bush's latest
statement. ``I'm glad to see that the vice president now agrees
with me and a great number of American citizens.''
   Dukakis was attending a fund-raiser Friday evening and heading
to Washington on Saturday to participate in ceremonies marking the
25th anniversary of the civil rights march on the nation's capital
led by the late Martin Luther King Jr.
