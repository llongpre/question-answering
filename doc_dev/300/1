OK, so MTV and other video channels knocked "American Bandstand" off the air 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
Now Burbank-based Dick Clark Productions hopes its name, spirit and ability to 
generate cash flow from the American public will rock on at a string of novelty 
restaurants named for the television show that entertained generations of 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot diner overlooking Biscayne Bay in Miami opened Monday as Dick Clark's 
American Bandstand Grill, complete with a mock "Bandstand" set; a pop art 
cellar club that recalls the 1960s and other decade theme areas; a sing-along 
arena; and TV monitors churning out repeats of "Bandstand" segments from 1958 
to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, patrons can use the grill's video studio. For a fee, they can 
record their own music videos with intros from Clark, once known as "America's 
oldest teen-ager" and the host of "American Bandstand" for more than 30 years.

"We realize there is untapped value in certain trademarks," said Francis C. La 
Maina, president of Dick Clark Productions. "For the past year we have been 
actively exploring ways to capitalize on those assets." 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank company kicked in its famous name in a joint venture with Harmon 
Entertainment, a Secaucus, N.J., commercial real estate outfit that paid 
start-up costs and the $2-million construction cost of the 8,500-square-foot 
restaurant.
