   They boogied and stomped their way into the
nation's living rooms in the 1950s when American Bandstand was
filmed in Philadelphia. Now they're back in the city where it
began, rehearsing for a reunion.
   For the first time in 30 years, 27 of the original Bandstand
dancers, including Kenny, Arlene, Carole, Flossie and Jim, got
together Thursday night to rehearse their steps for a show Sept. 4
at Philadelphia's Penn's Landing.
   ``American Bandstand,'' with host Dick Clark, made its network
debut on ABC television Aug. 5, 1957.
   Bandstander Joe Fusco of south Philadelphia and Lis Braun of the
Hot Foot Agency cooked up the idea of bringing the gang together
again. They came from Philadelphia, Camden, Manhatten and Houston
to bunnyhop, gossip and reminisce.
   ``Any place there's dancing, I'll still go,'' said Fusco, who
was 15 when he joined the show.
   Fusco developed the two-hour show with Braun, contacted all the
dancers and helped with the choreography. When he's not dancing,
Fusco is a professional party organizer.
   ``You were like a big star. Girls chased ya; the guys hated
ya,'' he said.
   The show was filmed near the University of Pennsylvania, across
from the Pop Singers drugstore, where the dancers used to hang out
to meet their fans. The drugstore is no longer there, but the steps
the dancers invented are still given a whirl: the bunny hop, the
chalypso and the stroll.
   Bob Horn emceed the show from its inception in 1952 until Dick
Clark took over in 1956. Clark moved the show to California in
1964, but the show's fans still remember it as a Philadelphia
phenomenon.
