   DICK CLARK PRODUCTIONS INC. said it reduced the size and price of its initial public offering to 1.1 million shares at $6.50 each. 
Last November, the Burbank, Calif.-based developer and producer of television programs filed for an offering of 1.6 million shares at an estimated price of $8 to $10 each. 
A spokesman said the company made the reduction because of "market conditions." 
Mr. Clark, host of the long-running "American Bandstand" television series, will retain 86% of the company's voting securities, the company said. 
Proceeds from the offering will be used for working capital and to expand the 29-year-old company's development, production and distribution of television programming. 
Allen &amp; Co. and L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc. are the underwriters.
