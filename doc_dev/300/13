<LEADPARA>  Just how old is America's oldest teen-ager, anyway? A curious prosecutor --
actually, a prosecutor with a curious wife -- took the chance to find out last

federal court in Dallas as a character witness for a defendant in an
investment-fraud trial.;    When it came time to cross-examine Clark,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Webster was ready. "Since I have you under oath,
