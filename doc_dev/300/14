   Dick Clark Productions Inc. expects to report lower earnings and revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30, and for the full year ending next June 30, said Francis La Maina, the company's president. 

   For the quarter, net income was about $100,000, or one cent a share, down from about $1.6 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier, Mr. La Maina said. 
Revenue was between $7.5 million and $8 million, down from about $9 million a year ago, he added. 

   Mr. La Maina said the lower results were due to a $3 million syndication sale in the year-earlier quarter that contributed $1.6 million to earnings. 
There wasn't a similar item in the latest period. 

   Mr. La Maina said the television production company founded by TV personality Dick Clark, who still has a 78% stake, has stepped up production activity and hopes "to establish a more consistent source of revenue." 

   Without providing specific figures, Mr. La Maina said he anticipates that results for fiscal 1988 will be lower than those of fiscal 1987, when the company had net of $2.6 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $28.9 million. 
Mr. La Maina said results in the current fiscal year will suffer in comparison because of unusually strong syndication sales in the prior year. 

   The executive said the company plans to increase its development of series and situation comedies, particularly in the variety area and in first-run syndications. 

   Mr. La Maina said the company is well positioned to expand production with more than $14 million in cash and no debt. 
He said the company doesn't plan any acquisitions or management changes, but does plan to add sales and creative staff. 
The company now has about 110 employees, he said. 

   The company gets most of its revenue from television series, but also has motion pictures in the development stage. 

   Dick Clark Productions went public in January, garnering $6.8 million from the sale of almost 1.3 million shares. 
Since then, in national over-the-counter trading, the stock has risen as high as $8.125 apiece but, as have the shares of many newly public entertainment companies, the price has fallen. 
Yesterday, Dick Clark Productions closed at $4, down 50 cents.
