   Dick Clark, the ageless rock 'n' roll emcee
whose ``American Bandstand'' gave teen-agers everything from the
jitterbug to Madonna, says he is leaving the show after 33 years as
host.
   ``American Bandstand,'' syndicated nationwide, will move to USA
Network on April 8 with David Hirsch as host.
   ``This is actually an exciting day for me,'' Clark said Tuesday.
``Like David, I was 26 when I started hosting Bandstand. After 33
years, I finally decided it was time to give someone else a chance.''
   Hirsch, a Detroit native, was discovered at dick clark
productions in Burbank. At the time, he was a producer for ``USA's
CAMP MIDNITE,'' a late-night talk show on USA Network, which is seen
in more than 46 million homes through 10,000 cable affiliates.
   Hirsch had to audition for ``American Bandstand.''
   Clark's age, 59, had nothing to do with the decision, said an
associate who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the past, Clark
has indicated he wanted to relinquish his host role by 1990.
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, hit the TV air waves in
September 1952 on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee
Stewart as hosts.
   But it was Clark, who took over in 1956, that became the show's
symbol, even as it made him a multi-millionaire.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' debuted on the ABC
network, quickly becoming a national success.
   Generations of teen-agers saw the clean-cut, carefully suited and
coiffed Clark preside over a studio full of equally clean-cut teens,
dancing and posing for the cameras.
   Clark, who never danced on the show, became the butt of some
jokes for maintaining his boyish looks over the years. He once
compared the burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets to
be a drag after a while, because someday the looks have gotta go,''
he said. ``It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully.''
   Off-screen, Clark has acknowledged that he has a temper and is
intolerant of mistakes by subordinates. But in his ``Bandstand''
persona, teens saw him as a friendly, hip father figure.
   The show was a must for many performers.
   During its three decades, it has provided the first national
exposure to scores of performers, including Madonna, the Beach Boys,
Linda Ronstadt, Jerry Lee Lewis, James Brown, Stevie Wonder and Neil
Diamond.
   Others making nationwide debuts on the show included Chubby
Checker, Buddy Holly, Sonny &amp; Cher, The Doors, Barry Manilow,
Prince, Pat Benatar, Sheena Easton, Cyndi Lauper and Billy Idol.
   ``American Bandstand'' also launched songs onto the best-seller
charts and introduced America to such dances as the Twist, Jerk,
Bunny Hop, Hustle and Break Dancing.
   In 1987, ``American Bandstand'' was entered into the Guinness
Book of World Records as television's longest-running variety
program. It has earned five Emmy awards.
   The show has been on the air 37 years, through more than 6,000
hours, played more than 65,000 records and been host to more than
600,000 dancing teen-agers.
   In a 1986 interview with USA Today, Clark said he helped in
``keeping the music alive'' in the early days of televised rock, but
described himself as a fortunate man of limited abilities.
   ``I don't have any basic talents myself,'' he said. ``I have the
ability to work on television and feel comfortable with and make
other people feel confortable with it. That's probably some sort of
a mild form of talent. Beyond that, I don't get too serious about
it.''
