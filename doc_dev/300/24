   Pop dynamo George Michael and heavy
metal leaders Def Leppard were the top nominees Wednesday in the
16th annual American Music Awards, which choses winners by popular
vote.
   Michael, whose crossover album, ``Faith,'' has spawned six hit
singles over the last year and scored on both pop and soul charts,
was nominated as favorite male vocalist in the pop-rock and
soul-rhythm and blues categories and received favorite album
nominations in those same categories.
   Def Leppard was nominated in the pop-rock category for favorite
duo or group and favorite album for their ``Hysteria'' LP. They also
received the favorite artist and favorite album nominations in the
heavy metal category.
   Earning three nominations each for the awards were heavy metal
bands Guns N' Roses and Van Halen. Country music star Randy Travis
also earned three nominations.
   The awards show, set for broadcast Jan. 30 on ABC-TV, added heavy
metal and rap music to categories for this year while eliminating
video music awards.
   ``We did it several years ago with the disco era. We just added
the category. It seemed logical,'' producer Dick Clark said.
   Clark, who this year took over production of the annual MTV Video
Awards show, said videos had been eliminated because ``There are
other awards shows that seem to take care of that category.''
   The American Music Awards nomination categories this year include
pop-rock, soul-rhythm and blues, country, heavy metal and rap.
   Among the groups and performers receiving at least two
nominations were Alabama, Rick Astley, Tracy Chapman, D.J. Jazzy
Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Gladys
Knight &amp; The Pips, Run D.M.C., Salt-N-Pepa, George Strait, Al B.
Sure! and Steve Winwood.
   Nominees were announced by Jermaine Jackson and Rita Coolidge
during a morning news conference.
   Clark said this year's show will include tributes to Roy Orbison,
soul singer Brook Benton and pop singer Andy Gibb. All three died in
the last year. The show will also present an award of merit to an
artist yet to be announced for outstanding contributions to musical
entertainment.
   Hosts for this year's show will be Kenny Rogers, Anita Baker, Rod
Stewart and Debbie Gibson. They also will perform, along with Rick
Astley, Fleetwood Mac, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine,
Guns N' Roses, K.T. Oslin, Randy Travis, and D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The
Fresh Prince.
   Clark noted the American Music Awards show is traditionally the
second-highest rated awards show on television, next to the Oscars.
   Names of nominees are compiled from year-end sales charts of the
music industry trade publication Cash Box.
   Winners are selected by a public polling of 20,000 people who
receive ballots sent by Herbert Altman Communications Research Inc.
The ballots are counted by the Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.
accounting firm.
   The Grammy Awards of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences are determined by votes of artists and technicians in the
music industry. Nominees for those awards will be made Jan. 12.
