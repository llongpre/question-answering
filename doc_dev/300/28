   Rainshowers canceled a huge shindig to
celebrate the construction of a 30-story pyramid, but organizers
said they would try again after mopping up flooded beer stands and
stages set up for street-party bands.
   The party will go on tonight, weather permitting.
   ``It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken out
of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water,''
developer Sidney Shlenkler said Friday.
   Promoters had promised for weeks that the event would be the
biggest party Memphis had ever seen. Police had expected up to
100,000 people, and several thousand would-be revelers showed up
despite the downpour.
   At a luncheon to kick off the celebration, rock 'n' roll pioneer
Dick Clark announced he will supply hundreds of videotapes, films
and other memorabilia for a music museum in the pyramid.
   Clark, who helped popularize rock 'n' roll with his TV show
American Bandstand, said the music hall of fame will be linked to
his annual American Music Awards show and include computerized
displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's musical past.
   The stainless steel pyramid, which is being built along the
Mississippi River, is intended as the centerpiece of a $200 million
tourist theme park billed as a musical Disneyland and scheduled to
open in May 1991.
   The pyramid and music park are being financed largely through
public funds and developed primarily by Shlenker, who helped develop
the Houston Astrodome, and by international businessman John Tigrett.
   Shlenker likes to compare the pyramid with the Eiffel Tower and
the Statue of Liberty and said he expects the music theme park to
eventually draw up to 3 million tourists a year.
