Country music singer-songwriter Willie Nelson will go home from the American 
Music Awards on Jan. 30. with a special award of merit for career achievement. 
Another 22 awards will be handed out in pop-rock, soul-rhythm and blues, 
country, rap, and heavy metal categories. Dick Clark is producing the award 
show, which will be seen on ABC-TV. Nelson, known for his song-writing and 
acting successes, also has organized the Farm Aid concerts to help beleaguered 
family farms in the United States. ALEENE MacMINN
