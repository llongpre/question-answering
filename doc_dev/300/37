   Country music singer Barbara Mandrell
used ringers to win a come-from-behind victory over a team led by
Bob Hope in the Barbara Mandrell Celebrity Softball Classic.
   A host of celebrities including talk show host Oprah Winfrey,
entertainer Dick Clark, rock musician Meat Loaf and rap musician
L.L. Cool J turned out for the 18-17 victory Friday by Mandrell's
AT&amp;T Ringers over Hope's Pepsi Challengers.
   Before the game, Hope was anything but pessimistic.
   ``Pay no attention to Barbara's team,'' the comedian said.
``We're gonna kill 'em. We're gonna win, even if we have to cheat.''
   Mandrell literally got a lift from former Pittsburgh Steelers
great Lynn Swann during one of her trips to the plate. Swann
hoisted the petite singer parallel to the ground, and began
swinging his new ``bat.''
   In the second inning, John Stamos, the heartthrob of the ``Full
House'' television show, strutted to the plate and made two strikes
before grounding to Ron Perlman, star of the ``Beauty and the
Beast.'' TV show. Stamos joked he ``was a lover not an athlete.''
   ``I'll be the judge of that,'' said pop star Sheena Easton.
   Proceeds from the game went to the Vanderbilt University Medical
Center transplant program.
