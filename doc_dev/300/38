ROBERT HILBURN: AMERICAN 'MICHAEL' AWARDS: MORE ADVERTISING THAN ART 
</P>

It was fitting that Diet Coke launched its high-powered George Michael ad 
campaign on the American Music Awards telecast. 
</P>
<P>
The annual pop special itself is simply one long -- very l-o-n-g -- commercial. 
</P>
<P>
When pop stars (including Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood) weren't seen hawking 
beer in conventional commercials during Monday's three-hour event, they were on 
stage hyping themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike next month's Grammy Awards ceremony, where the emphasis is on artistic 
achievement, the American Music Awards is simply an excuse for a television 
program. No sin in that, but it does make performers look a bit silly when they 
shed tears and repeatedly thank God for their trophies. 
</P>
<P>
The "awards" are based on results of a national popularity poll conducted among 
approximately 20,000 music fans -- which helps explain how Whitney Houston 
could defeat Tracy Chapman for recordings in 1988 and how the "Dirty Dancing" 
sound track could defeat anything. 
</P>
<P>
If Dick Clark Productions gave out the pyramid-shaped trophies at a private 
dinner, they would be lucky to have enough stars on hand to generate one good 
trade publication publicity photo. 
</P>
<P>
Because the awards are handed out on prime-time television, however, artists 
scurry for seats. The lure: 60 seconds or so for the winners at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
If that exposure isn't enticing enough, superstars can look forward to special 
awards and -- crucially -- extra time. 
</P>
<P>
Two special awards and 16 minutes of exposure were enough to lure the normally 
reclusive Michael Jackson to the Shrine Auditorium stage, where another 
superstar, comedian Eddie Murphy, obediently narrated a gushing 
mini-documentary of Jackson's recent "Bad" tour. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Jackson had to fight to get the 16 minutes and the awards. The 
show's producers would have given him 26 minutes because it's a coup having 
Jackson involved at all. 
</P>
<P>
Even Murphy, whose persona is based on his ultra-confident manner, seemed 
intimidated by Jackson's transcendent fame. 
</P>
<P>
When the pop star stepped to the microphone to accept the awards, he discovered 
the stand was too low. After trying to bend over awkwardly to reach the 
microphone, the unnerved Jackson stepped back and asked Murphy to adjust the 
stand for him. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy moved forward like an eager stage hand before remembering that he, too, 
is a star and that it wasn't his job to fix the microphone stand. 
</P>
<P>
In Murphy's only spontaneous -- and funny -- remark, he quipped, "(Michael) 
said, 'Eddie pull it up,' like I was working for him . . . and I started to do 
it, too, 'Yes Michael.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though Willie Nelson also received a special award (and 9 minutes of TV time), 
the evening's co-star was the other Michael -- George Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Jackson's 16-minute salute served in the end to further enhance the 
status of his pop rival from Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The much ballyhooed Diet Coke commercial didn't have much fizz: scenes of a 
matador preparing for battle juxtaposed against scenes of pop star Michael 
getting ready to face his fans on stage. 
</P>
<P>
But the English pop star's victories in three American Music Awards categories 
(most popular R&amp;B album, male R&amp;B singer and male pop/rock singer) did 
leave their mark. 
</P>
<P>
Because Michael Jackson was also nominated in the two latter categories, the 
message for millions of viewers was that George Michael -- despite all the 
excitement of the 16 minutes of "Bad" tour footage" -- was the more popular 
record-maker in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Equally impressive was the graceful way the young Englishman handled himself at 
the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Though his "Faith" album has sold more than 6 million copies in the United 
States alone, Michael is still struggling to win credibility as an artist -- a 
goal made more difficult by his former membership in the lightweight British 
pop duo Wham! 
</P>
<P>
Michael may be reading more into the awards than the voting decrees, but there 
was a disarming sense of genuine humility in his remarks each time he accepted 
an award. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to say that a couple of years back when I split the (duo), I 
knew I had a tough job ahead of me . . . and I thought that maybe people 
weren't going to give me much of a chance," he said in his final visit to the 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I'd just like to thank everybody . . . for giving me that chance and 
letting me prove myself." 
</P>
<P>
If the head-to-head competition between the two Michaels produced a true moment 
of drama in an evening of unabashed self-promotion, most of the telecast was as 
flat as the Diet Coke spot. 
</P>
<P>
With the array of stars on stage (from country's Randy Travis to rap's D.J. 
Jazzy Jeff), one certainly got a look at the range of commercial pop music 
these days. But it was surface rather than substance. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Guns N' Roses' defiant rendition of "Patience," the live 
performances (ranging from Rick Astley and Sade to the Miami Sound Machine and 
K.T. Oslin) were uneventful, and the evening's co-hosts (Kenny Rogers, Anita 
Baker, Rod Stewart and Debbie Gibson) were uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next year the producers ought to acknowledge the program's TV-show 
foundation and invite Oprah, Phil and Geraldo to co-host. That'd probably boost 
ratings -- and those three certainly know the realities of television 
self-promotion.
