   Paul McCartney, Dick Clark, Miles Davis and
the late Vladimir Horowitz and Nat King Cole will receive lifetime
achievement awards at this year's Grammy Awards ceremonies.
   McCartney, Clark and Davis have agreed to appear Feb. 21 at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for the Grammy telecast, said
Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording
Artists.
   McCartney's impact on music as a songwriter and member of the
Beatles, as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were
cited as reasons for his award.
   Davis played a crucial role in the development of jazz since the
1940s, the academy said.
   Horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th
century's greatest classical pianist, and Cole was cited as a
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s.
   The inclusion of Clark was a surprise because he produces the
American Music Awards, which competes with the Grammys. The shows
are a month apart and many artists will appear on only one show,
fearing overexposure.
   ``We don't view these shows as competitive and when you look at
the big contribution Clark has made to the recording industry,
especially in exposing new talent, there is no question he is
deserving,'' Greene said.
   Clark will receive the Trustees Award because he is a
non-performing contributor to music. Past recipients include
inventors Thomas Edison and Robert Moog.
