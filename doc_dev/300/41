   Do television viewers need another program
showcasing the video gimmickry of video camera owners? NBC seems to
think so.
   The network will broadcast the premiere of ``Do-It-Yourself TV''
Sunday night, a slightly different but unmistakable hybrid of
ABC-TV's top-rated ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   Dick Clark, who is producing and serving as co-host of the new
show, says he thinks people love to watch the latest rave, no
matter how many times it's duplicated.
   He should know. When he did ``TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes''
for NBC six years ago, it started its own copycat bonanza. ABC
quickly announced it was doing a celebrity show called ``Foul-ups,
Bleeps &amp; Blunders.''
   How many video shows can the market stand?
   ``They asked the same question when `Bloopers' came to the
fore,'' Clark said Thursday in a phone interview from New York,
``and there were three on at the time.''
   ``Bloopers'' had some home video segments, ``but we weren't
smart enough to think of home video bloopers,'' Clark said.
   ``People in our office were somewhat exercised'' by the success
of ABC's home video show, which premiered as a series in January,
four years after ``Bloopers'' was canceled, Clark said.
   ``If you're not smart enough to think of a new angle, you can't
feel bad about it,'' he said.
   When NBC approached Clark about ``Do-It-Yourself TV,'' a new
angle was exactly what the network wanted.
   CBS had virtually owned Sunday evenings, beginning with the 7
p.m. broadcast of its venerable ``60 Minutes.'' But ABC, with a
program that showed America's warts and stumbles, was now No. 1 in
the time spot.
   For ```Do-It-Yourself TV,'' we came back with the idea of
sending these amateur videographers out on assignment,'' Clark
said. ``There's nothing socially redeeming about these assignments,
they're just crazy.''
   Like having six fully uniformed motorcycle cops singing
``Feelings'' and ``Stop in the Name of Love,'' taping how silly
people look and sound when they sing along to earphones on their
heads, and a pizzeria where the customers are invited to throw a
little dough.
   ``You're not going to learn anything. You're not going to retain
any of it,'' Clark said. ``It's like junk food. It's entertainment.
And I'm not ashamed of that.''
