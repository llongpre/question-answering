   Bill Cullen, a television personality and
game show host whose career spanned such hits as ``I've Got a
Secret,'' ``The Price is Right'' and ``The $25,000 Pyramid,'' has
died of lung cancer at age 70.
   Cullen, who died Saturday at his home in Bel Air, appeared on
radio and television game shows from 1944 to 1988,
   With his crew cut and heavy-frame glasses, he became a familiar
face as a panelist on CBS's ``I've Got A Secret'' from 1952 to
1967. He also was host of the original ``Price is Right'' from 1957
to 1964 on NBC and later on ABC.
   ``Bill was the ultimate host,'' said colleague Dick Clark. ``He
had great humor, intelligence and humanity. Most of all he had the
great talent of making his job look easy.''
   ``He was the best,'' said Clark, who was master of ceremonies
for ``The $10,000 Pyramid,'' while Cullen was host of the nighttime
version, ``The $25,000 Pyramid.''
   ``He certainly created the yardstick of professionalism by which
all other MCs could follow,'' said Cullen's manager, George Spota.
   Cullen's game show resume also includes ``Three on a Match,''
``Pass the Buck,'' ``To Tell the Truth'' and ``The Joker's Wild.''
   He made the cover of the national edition of TV Guide seven
times between 1954 and 1984, including twice in one month in 1964.
   Cullen was working in a garage in Pittsburgh in 1939 when he got
his first job in broadcasting as an unpaid assistant disc jockey.
He later became a regular announcer earning $25 a week.
   In 1943, Cullen moved to New York and became a staff announcer
with the CBS Radio Network. A year later, he became announcer for
the ``Winner Take All'' game show.
   Cullen's first television game show was ``Give and Take,'' a
1952 question-and-answer show on which he was co-host with John
Reed King.
   ``He's spent more time on broadcast air, radio and television,
than anyone else in the business,'' said Spota.
   Bob Stewart, who produced ``The Price Is Right'' for eight
years, said Cullen was in a class by himself.
   ``Professionally, nobody I ever worked with was his peer,'' said
Stewart, a friend for 35 years. ``There was nobody like him nor
will there every be. Off camera, he was the same kind of lovable,
fun, mischievous guy you saw on television.''
   ``I hope never to be a big, really big, star,'' Cullen told The
New York Times in 1958. ``I may never be one in any case. But I've
seen too many big names burn themselves out on television.''
   Cullen is survived by his wife, Ann.
