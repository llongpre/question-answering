<TEXT>     Archie, that orange-haired, freckle-faced, 17-year-old comic-book star, is
50 years old this month and going strong. The character and his supporting
cast have built a comics empire. Archie Comics Publications is No. 3 among
comic book producers, trailing only DC and Marvel.;   Archie was the
brainchild of publisher John Goldwater, who loosely based the character on the
Henry Aldrich radio show.;   However, the world of Archie grew out of the mind
and experiences of initial artist Bob Montana. His widow, Peg Bertholet, told
Entertainment Weekly's Tim Appelo that Montana derived many of the characters
in Archie's world from his own life.;   Weatherbee, the principal of Archie's
beloved Riverdale High, was inspired by Montana's high school principal, who
"told him that if he didn't stop drawing he'd never get anywhere in the
world.";   Among the others: Jughead is said to be his schoolmate Skinny
Lenaham, although Montana once said the character was created "on the drawing
board. I never knew him"; Betty was a girl Montana dated; and Veronica was
film star Veronica Lake.;   Montana died from a heart attack in 1975. He was
54.;   Archie's world has undergone many surface changes over the years, in
various titles, but remains largely unchanged since its inception. Jughead
still wears his weird hat, Archie is still torn between Betty and Veronica,
and all still attend Riverdale High.;   The various Archie titles have had
only minor cosmetic changes over the years. In the '50s, Archie wore a
letterman's sweater and tried out the Hula Hoop. In the '60s, the gang poked
fun at hippie looks and desires, and in the '70s, did the Hustle at teen
discos in bell-bottom jeans. These days, Jughead has a VCR, Moose is dyslexic
and Archie wears Rollerblades.;   Although very few comic-book collectors take
the various Archie titles seriously, the teen's first appearance in Pep Comics
No. 22 is rated by the Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide as being
worth $2,700 in mint/near mint condition. Among its contemporaries, its worth
is comparable to Captain America No. 3, which introduced the Red Skull to
readers.;   Archie's stock is rising rapidly, too. Consider that in 1976
Overstreet rated that same comic as being worth $50. In 1987, $1,190.;   The
Archie characters have invaded television and pop music as well.;   Ron Dante
and Toni Wine recorded "Sugar, Sugar" in 1969 under the Archies name. The
song, which displaced the Rolling Stones' "Honky-tonk Women" when it reached
No. 1 that year, defined bubble gum rock.;   The series has seen cartoon life,
was brought to life by actors in a 1990 television movie, and some say helped
inspire "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis."  </TEXT>
