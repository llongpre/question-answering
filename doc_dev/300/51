   MTM Entertainment Inc. said it plans to raise $100 million or more with an initial public offering of about 22% of the company, but analysts said the concern named for actress Mary Tyler Moore is setting its sights too high. 

   The entertainment company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of four million common shares. 
MTM said it expects the stock to fetch between $25 a share and $28 a share, or a total of between $100 million and $112 million. 
Based on the 18 million shares that would be outstanding after the offering, MTM would have a market value of $450 million to $504 million. 

   But industry observers expressed skepticism at MTM's estimate of its value. 
"With a $400 million-plus valuation, the company would have to have a very valuable (television) library," said Joel H. Reader, managing director of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, an investment banking firm. 

   Mr. Reader added that the recent financial difficulties of many independent production companies "has caused a chill to fall on initial public offerings for television production companies." 
He noted that offerings for Aaron Spelling Productions Inc., which is based here, and Burbank, Calif.-based Dick Clark Productions Inc. -- both television producers -- weren't as well received by the market as initially anticipated. 

   One securities analyst, who declined to be identified, said that while MTM "is a very good little company," the current environment doesn't favor a public offering. 
"I can go down a long list of entertainment company stocks, and most of them are down from their original offering price," he said. 

   MTM was formed in 1970 by Ms. Moore and Grant Tinker, formerly Ms. Moore's husband, to oversee production of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and several other successful TV series, most of which were sold to CBS Inc. Mr. Tinker later left the company and went on to become chairman of National Broadcasting Co., now a unit of General Electric Co. 
He left NBC last year. 

   MTM and CBS jointly own a TV production facility here in the neighborhood of Studio City, where MTM produces its shows. 
The company has produced a total of 28 TV series and 14 made-for-TV movies, including such recent popular programs as "Hill Street Blues" and "St. 
Elsewhere." 
MTM also develops and produces motion pictures and operates a record and music publishing company in Nashville, Tenn., that specializes in country music. 
The company's film credits include production work on "Terms of Endearment." 

   MTM said it would sell two million of the common shares under the offering, and the company's four shareholders would sell the remaining two million. 
MTM's shareholders are Arthur Price, president; Mel D. Blumenthal, senior executive vice president; Thomas E. Palmieri Jr., executive vice president; and Ms. Moore, a director. 
Lazard Freres &amp; Co. is managing the offering. 

   The company said it would use $9.3 million of the proceeds to purchase its outstanding preferred stock, $3 million to redeem a debenture and the remainder to pay down a revolving credit line that currently totals $92.5 million.
