   The new Miss Teen USA said Tuesday
she's happy to be a winner and doesn't think the disqualification
of a rival detracts from her victory.
   ``I'm really proud of where I am,'' said Mindy Duncan, a
16-year-old from Oregon. ``It was a wonderful experience, it was
such a confidence-booster.''
   Miss Teen California, 16-year-old Alison Moreno of El Toro, was
allowed to participate in the televised pageant Monday night but
was disqualified from competition for rule-breaking, said pageant
spokeswoman Martha Kaiser.
   Publicist Les Schecter said after the Monday night telecast that
Miss Moreno had violated curfew, but Ms. Kaiser on Tuesday refused
to specify the infraction. The 51 girls in the contest were
chaperoned and required to abide by a number of rules during their
three-week stay prior to the pageant.
   Telephone calls to Miss Moreno's home went unanswered Tuesday.
   It was the second time in six weeks that controversy has
interfered with a beauty contest in California.
   On June 13, as the winners of the Miss California contest were
being announced in a televised pageant in San Diego, Michelle
Anderson, 21, of Santa Cruz unfurled a white silk banner that read
``Pageants hurt all women.'' She was hustled from the stage.
   Miss Duncan, who gets cash, a Jeep, furs, jewelry and other
merchandise worth $150,000, said she didn't know Miss Moreno had
been disqualified until right before the show and wasn't told the
reason.
   ``I know nothing about that,'' Miss Duncan said. ``We were told
right on stage that she wouldn't be allowed to participate.''
   A brief disclaimer preceded the CBS telecast of the pageant. At
a gathering afterward, a reporter who persisted in questioning the
contestants about Miss Moreno's disqualification was ordered to
leave by contest officials.
   The semifinalists appeared in bathing suits and evening gowns
for 12 celebrity judges. Each was interviewed by Dick Clark, host
of American Bandstand and the $100,000 Pyramid game show.
