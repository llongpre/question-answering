   Unless you're compelled to spend New Year's Eve
knee-deep in honking, confetti-hurling strangers, there's plenty of
entertainment right at home with a loyal friend who's been there for
you all year _ your television set.
   It doesn't hand out party favors or free champagne, but Saturday
night TV offers an array of musical specials featuring, among others
this year, Johann Strauss, Placido Domingo, Mel Torme, Reba
McEntire, Manhattan Transfer, Robert Plant and Hall &amp; Oates.
   Public television is especially busy. Check local listings with
the big-band sounds of ``Happy New Year U.S.A.!'' and Mel Torme; and
``Live from Lincoln Center'' with Zubin Mehta, Placido Domingo and
the New York Philharmonic.
   On Sunday, the Vienna Philharmonic has its fifth New Year's
special on PBS, this time featuring conductor Carlos Kleiber and a
program of Strauss music. Walter Cronkite is once again host of the
special.
   At a recent luncheon to publicize ``From Vienna: The New Year's
Celebration 1989,'' Cronkite recalled that last year's taping of his
introduction _ from a balcony overlooking the stage before the
concert began _ didn't exactly stir the holiday spirit in everyone.
   ``Last year, a harpist _ more harpy than harpist _ showed up very
early to tune up her harp. Every time I got up to say anything, the
harp starts going,'' said Cronkite. ``We sent a runner down asking
her to desist for five minutes. No, not for TV.
   ``I always thought the harp was kind of a gentle instrument. Not
in her hands. It was a trumpet of Jericho. We sent the management of
the house, in tails. She still was not moving.
   ``Then two stage hands came out and picked her up with the harp
and carried her out of the hall, outside somewhere.''
   The show went on, as it will this year. Incidentally, Cronkite's
favorite waltz is ``The Blue Danube.'' He says the Austrians might
write them, but Americans know the finer points of dancing them, and
he and his wife, Betsy, impress the Viennese by reversing during a
waltz. ``They appreciate this,'' Cronkite said. ``They have
difficulty reversing in a waltz.''
   If you prefer to see in the new year getting down with some hard
rock, MTV offers ``Big Bang '89,'' a countdown of top videos. Close
to midnight on the East Coast, MTV will go live to Times Square,
where comedian Sandra Bernhard will be joined by guests Gilbert
Gottfried, Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopi Goldberg, among others.
Then, thanks to the magic of time zones, MTV will move to the West
Coast for its midnight celebration with comedian Sam Kinison as host
and guests who include rockers Robert Plant, Hall &amp; Oates and Poison.
   Want to rock but have no cable? ABC has ``Dick Clark's New Year's
Rockin' Eve '89,'' with live reports from Times Square on Saturday
night, as well as the Cocoanut Grove in Hollywood, featuring
performances by Natalie Cole, Taylor Dayne, Richard Marx, Reba
McEntire and Frankie Valli &amp; The Four Seasons, among others.
   The Disney Channel will be repeating ``The Manhattan Transfer:
Going Home,'' which isn't necessarily a New Year's Eve special, but
features the always welcome jazz sounds of the famed vocal quartet.
   Back over on PBS, Mel Torme returns for a second year as host of
``Happy New Year U.S.A.!'', a big-band and jazz show that originates
live from Baltimore. This year, Torme is joined by vocalists
Rosemary Clooney and Lonette McKee and the Glenn Miller Orchestra.
There will also be ice dancing with John Curry and JoJo Starbuck.

   Elsewhere in television:
   STARTING ANEW BY LOOKING BACK _ C-SPAN next week starts a 20-hour
series, ``The Reagan Legacy,'' featuring interviews with Reagan
administration officials, including former Cabinet members Edwin
Meese III, Caspar Weinberger and William Bennett, former White House
chiefs of staff Howard Baker and Donald Regan and former deputy
chief of staff Michael Deaver. ...
   STARTING ANEW BY STARTING ANEW _ GTG Entertainment plans a
January ``re-launch'' of its nightly newsmagazine, ``USA Today: The
Television Show.'' GTG indicated its commitment to the syndicated
show by renewing it for the 1989-90 television season already. After
a rocky first few months _ it premiered in September _ the producers
feel the show has settled into a comfortable format and hope TV
critics, and viewers, will take another look. The show is seen on
158 stations nationwide. ...
   SENIOR VICE PRESIDENCIES UNDER TREE FOR NBC EXECS _ NBC News
President Michael Gartner has reorganized his top brass. Joe Angotti
has been named senior veep instead of regular veep. He takes over
coverage, operations, special programming, weekend ``Nightly News,''
``Sunrise'' and affiliate relations. Tom Ross, already a senior
veep, will head up a new ``strategic planning'' department that will
also include Bob McFarland, former Washington bureau chief, and Bob
Keyes, now director of news operations. Tim Russert, previously
named senior veep in Washington will oversee ``Sunday Today,''
``Meet the Press'' and the Washington bureau.
