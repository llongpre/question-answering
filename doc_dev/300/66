In 1964, Tom Clark met Rock Hudson at a bridge game at the home of a mutual 
friend. Clark, who at the time was a publicist at MGM, had met and worked with 
a number of top stars and so he was not daunted by this first encounter with 
Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hudson's own posthumous autobiography ("Rock Hudson: His Story," 
actually written by Sara Davidson although Hudson initiated the project in 1985 
when he was near death), the two men grew close and eventually became lovers. 
In 1973, Clark moved into Hudson's home, where he lived until 1983, and he 
later returned to help care for Hudson in the months before the movie star died 
of AIDS-related diseases.

Now Clark has written his own book about their life together, but anyone 
expecting a great love story will be sorely disappointed. Clark's book is more 
that of a publicist than of an intimate. 
</P>
<P>
He writes about the fabulous parties they gave, the trips they took and the 
famous people they met. There are anecdotes aplenty. Clark portrays Hudson as a 
somewhat innocent, friendly and sincere man who needed guidance, from someone 
savvy like Clark, in both his personal and business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark never acknowledges that their relationship went beyond being 
roommates and business associates. It's an odd fact, given that their alleged 
relationship was revealed in some detail in the Hudson-Davidson book. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a missed opportunity. Hudson, who won only occasional accolades for 
his acting, was one of the major sex symbols of Hollywood. If word had gotten 
out to the public during his working years that he was a gay man, it surely 
would have scuttled his career. Clark could have given us a fascinating 
insider's view of this kind of secretive arrangement and the conflicting 
emotions that must have gone along with it. At the least, he could have 
acknowledged that side of Hudson's life and explain why he didn't want to write 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine" is not a completely gentle book -- Clark strikes 
out with a vengeance at those who he feels misused Hudson. But it is a shallow 
one. David Colker
