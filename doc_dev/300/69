   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith
doesn't see much humor in a documentary named after him _ ``Roger &amp;
Me,'' which chronicles life in Flint, Mich., where GM closed 11
plants.
   Smith, at a news conference Wednesday to discuss GM's new
electric-powered Impact car, said he hadn't seen the movie, didn't
plan to, and didn't want to talk much about it.
   ``I'm not muchfor sick humor and I don't like things that take
advantage of poor people,'' he said when reporters brought up the
film. He then changed the subject.
   The movie contains interviews with people who said they lost
their homes. One woman said she had to kill rabbits for food after
Smith shut down the GM plants. The closures eliminated 30,000 jobs
in the city of 150,000.
   Filmmaker Michael Moore said he had made arrangements with
Warner Bros. to reserve a seat for Smith at every showing of the
movie across the United States.

   Donna Rice, a household name after reporters
found she spent a weekend with Gary Hart, has become a born-again
Christian who spends much of her time doing charitable work,
according to a published report.
   A friend of Miss Rice's, Andy Messing, told The Washington Times
in a story Wednesday that she ``went back to her roots and because
she did, she wound up coming out of a tailspin that would have
killed other people.''
   Miss Rice, 32, who declined to be interviewed for the story,
became an instant celebrity in 1987 when her relationship with Hart
was publicized. Hart dropped out of the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination, and later made an unsuccessful re-entry
into the contest.
   Miss Rice now lives with a female friend in northern Virginia.
The newspaper said she doesn't have a full-time paying job, and
quoted friends as saying she has become quietly involved in
charitable work.
   The newspaper also said she has a boyfriend, and attends some of
Washington's high-profile dinners and events.
   ``Donna ... has not gone through that much of a change,'' said
Tricia Erickson, head of a McLean, Va., modeling agency and Miss
Rice's designated crisis manager in 1987. ``I don't think that she
`went to God,' so to speak. Donna's always been like that. It isn't
some miraculous thing.''

   World chess champion Garry Kasparov has an entire
country indignant over his latest move.
   Kasparov, 26, proposed in an interview in Playboy magazine's
November issue that the Soviet Union sell Mongolia, an independent
country and loyal ally of the Soviets, to China.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Wednesday
that protest letters and petitions signed by thousands of
Mongolians have arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Ulan Bator,
capital of Mongolia, and four Soviet consulates.
   He said two-hour strikes were held Dec. 30 at Mongolian plants
that make goods for the Soviet market.
   In the interview, Kasparov said: ``I just had the thought the
other day: Why don't we sell the Kuril Islands to the Japanese?
Frankly speaking, I'm not sure the islands belong to us, and the
Japanese, who claim them, would give us billions and billions for
them!
   ``That would keep us going for maybe five or 10 years. Then we
could sell Mongolia to China and get a few more years that way.''

   CBS has denied a published report that the
network will cancel the low-rated late-night ``Pat Sajak Show'' as
soon as it finds a replacement.
   ``CBS has no response,'' said a CBS official who declined to be
identified. ``This is an ongoing rumor and has no validity.''
   The trade publication Daily Variety said Wednesday that CBS was
delaying cancellation of the show until a replacement series was
found.
   Rumors of the show's cancellation have been circulating for
several months. Ratings for the show, introduced Jan. 9, have
trailed NBC's ``The Tonight Show'' starring Johnny Carson, the
syndicated ``Arsenio Hall Show'' and ABC's ``Nightline.''

   This year's Grammy Awards ceremonies will
include lifetime achievement honors to Dick Clark, Paul McCartney,
Miles Davis and the late Vladimir Horowitz and Nat King Cole.
   The five will be honored at the Feb. 21 event, said Michael
Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Artists.
   McCartney's impact on music as a songwriter and member of the
Beatles, as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were
cited as reasons for his achievement award.
   Jazz legend Davis played a crucial role in the development of
jazz since the 1940s, the academy said.
   Horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th
century's greatest classical pianist, and Cole was cited as a
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s.
   The inclusion of Clark was a surprise because he produces the
American Music Awards, which competes with the Grammys.
   ``We don't view these shows as competitive and when you look at
the big contribution Clark has made to the recording industry,
especially in exposing new talent, there is no question he is
deserving,'' Greene said.
