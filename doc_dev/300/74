   Doctors said today that singer Gloria
Estefan would need surgery for a broken vertebra she suffered when
a truck ran into her band's bus on a snow-covered mountain highway.
   Miss Estefan, lead singer of the Latin-pop band Miami Sound
Machine, has a ``partial neurologic deficit'' that is causing
numbness in her feet, Dr. Harry Schmaltz said at a news conference
at Community Medical Center.
   Schmaltz, an orthopedic surgeon at the hospital, said she needs
surgery to stabilize the spine and prevent further injury, but that
the family wants a specialist to perform the operation.
   He said there still was some danger of paralysis, and that she
would need about three to six months' recuperation in which she
would have to wear a constraining device to prevent further injury.
   Estefan expressed frustration to doctors at missing concerts and
concern about her 9-year-old son, who broke his collarbone in the
crash. Police gave the boy's name as Nayib but the hospital spelled
it Nayad. He was released Tuesday, along with Miss Estefan's
husband, Emilio Estefan Jr., who suffered head and hand injuries.
   Among the well-wishers who called the hospital were President
Bush and Dick Clark of ``American Bandstand'' fame.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush called
the 32-year-old singer this morning to wish her well and tell her
how much had enjoyed her visit at the White House on Monday to
discuss her anti-drug work.
   Miss Estefan is a longtime Bush supporter who performed at one
of his inaugural events in Washington in 1989.
   Also hospitalized was the singer's personal assistant, Barbara
Arencibia, 25, who suffered a back injury.
   The group was headed to Syracuse, N.Y., for a Tuesday night
concert. The accident occurred about noon on westbound Interstate
380 near Tobyhanna in the Pocono Mountains in eastern Pennsylvania.
   The Estefans' driver, Ron Jones, said he had stopped on the
highway when a tractor-trailer jackknifed in the snow and a truck
and bus stopped behind it. Jones said the bus was pushed into the
truck when another truck rammed it from behind. Miss Estefan was
asleep on a couch and was thrown to the floor.
   Trooper Joseph Kearney said the truck driver ``came up on them
and ... was unable to stop and he should have been.''
   The truck driver, identified as Heraldo E. Samuels of
Scarborough, Ontario, was cited for driving at an unsafe speed. He
was treated and released.
   Miss Estefan was nominated in February for best pop vocal
performance by a female for the single ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' in
the Grammy awards.
   Her new album, ``Cuts Both Ways,'' a collection of dance songs
and ballads, was 26th on the Cashbox magazine pop chart last week.
   The Cuban-born Miss Estefan and Miami Sound Machine have
attracted listeners worldwide with the sounds of salsa, samba and
conga for more than a decade. Their hits include ``Rhythm Is Gonna
Get You'' and ``Anything for You.''
   The band was recently renamed Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound
Machine.
