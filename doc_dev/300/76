   The biggest payola case since the scandal
that ruined the careers of some of rock 'n' roll's top disc jockeys
30 years ago has been thrown out by a judge who ruled prosecutors
deliberately withheld evidence.
   U.S. District Judge James Ideman on Tuesday dismissed payola and
racketeering charges against independent record promoter Joseph
Isgro, 43, citing ``outrageous government misconduct.'' The trial
began Aug. 21.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Lynch said he will appeal.
   Isgro was on trial on 57 counts of tax fraud, racketeering and
other charges. He was accused of paying cash and cocaine to radio
stations in Texas and California in return for playing certain
songs.
   The trial had featured testimony about cash and drugs stuffed
into album jackets and audio cassette cases delivered to radio
station executives.
   Ideman said prosecutors deliberately withheld from the defense
contradictory statements by a key witness, Dennis Di Ricco, a
former Internal Revenue Service agent convicted of tax conspiracy
and obstruction in 1989.
   Prosecutors had earlier denied hiding the testimony.
   ``Having been caught with a smoking pistol, the government,
which denied it had a pistol, then denied that the pistol smoked,''
the judge said.
   He declared a mistrial and dismissed the indictment. He also
threw out the case against Isgro's co-defendants, cocaine dealer
Jeffrey Monka, 32, and former Columbia Records executive Raymond
Anderson, 50.
   ``The government was willing to win at all costs and it got its
hand caught in the cookie jar,'' said defense attorney Don Re.
   The defense had discovered that Di Ricco, at his trial, denied
involvement in payola with Isgro, contradicting what he told the
grand jury that indicted Isgro.
   Isgro said he was ``relieved and happy'' the trial was over.
   Isgro's clients included Columbia, MCA, Warner Brothers, RCA and
Polygram Records.
   A 1960 federal law made it a crime punishable by a $10,000 fine
and up to a year in prison to offer money or other inducements to
give records airplay.
   The law followed a scandal that rocked the music industry in the
late 1950s and early '60s. The scandal led to congressional
hearings into the then-widespread practice of offering DJs
inducements to give certain records airplay.
   Among those called to testify were Dick Clark of ``American
Bandstand'' and Alan Freed, who is credited with inventing the term
rock 'n' roll.
   The investigation cost the careers of several top disc jockeys
of the era.
