Dick Clark Productions Inc. said it received a $4.5-million contract from 
Campaign Dynamics in Tokyo to secure performers for 10 concerts to be held in 
Japan under Dick Clark's American Music Awards trademark.

Terms call for Campaign Dynamics to pay for the concerts, including staging and 
promotional costs. Burbank-based Dick Clark, in addition to its fee for booking 
the talent, would retain television rights to show the concerts in all 
worldwide markets except Japan.
