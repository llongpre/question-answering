   A 16-year-old Oregonian who wants
to help child victims of drug and alcohol abuse was crowned Miss
Teen USA on Monday night at a pageant where a contestant was
disqualified.
   Pageant officials said only that the disqualification of Miss
Teen California, 16-year-old Alison Moreno, was prompted because
she broke a rule. She was allowed to participate in Monday night's
nationally televised contest.
   Mindy Duncan of Hillsboro, Ore., was delighted with her victory.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said the high school student on learning she
was the choice among 51 initial competitors, ages 15-18. ``It's a
feeling you can't explain.''
   Miss Duncan, a 5-foot, 3-inch enthusiast of dancing, running and
water skiing, said it is her ambition to work with children who
suffer drug and alcohol problems. She has done some of this work on
a volunteer basis.
   The four runners-up were: Jessica Collins of Amsterdam, N.Y.;
Amy Pietsch of Ringgold, La.; Kathleen McClellan of Bloomington,
Ill.; and Anna Mingus of Enterprise, Ala.
   An estimated 70 million viewers in the United States were
expected to watch the two-hour show, which was broadcast on CBS-TV.
The hosts were Dick Clark and actress Tracy Scoggins.
   The winner took the crown from 1987 Miss Teen USA Kristi Addis
of Holcolm, Miss., and $150,000 in cash and prizes, including a
Jeep, jewelry, a mink coat and mink jacket, exercise equipment and
an electronic keyboard.
