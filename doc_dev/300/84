   Geraldo Rivera says he's having a devil of a
time with NBC censors over the TV personality's upcoming special on
satanism.
   Rivera said Thursday he is so unhappy with network censors that
he may broadcast blank pictures Tuesday night rather than make more
cuts in his two-hour special, ``Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's
Underground.''
   ``We're going to make the changes that we consider
appropriate,'' Rivera said.
   NBC spokeswoman Rosemary Keenan said talks between Rivera and
network censors were continuing.
   Rivera had hoped the show would include graphic descriptions of
satanic murders and other rituals.
   ``NBC hired me to bring the viewer into the belly of this
beast,'' he said. ``There is an aspect of the grotesque in the
ritual crimes that are being committed out there.
   ``If you sanitize it to make it more palatable to the network
censors, then you do violence to the truth, in our opinion,''
Rivera said.

Dorian Gibbs.
   ``227'' is about a family living in Washington, D.C.

   Grammy Award-winning singer Lynn
Anderson was booked on a misdemeanor charge of malicious mischief
after a pre-dawn incident at the home of songwriter Paul Williams'
brother.
   Judicial Commissioner Howard Taradash released Anderson, known
for her 1970 hit ``(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden,'' on her
own recognizance after she was booked Wednesday following the
incident earlier that day.
   The warrant was sworn out by Linda Gail Bower, who told police
that Anderson vandalized her car and threatened her life after
songwriter Mentor Williams refused to let Anderson into his home.
   Ms. Bower, who was at the house, said Anderson stole her leather
jacket and threw some of her belongings into garbage pails.
   Ms. Bower said Mentor Williams is a former boyfriend of Anderson.
   ``This is nonsense. The charges have no merit,'' Anderson said
through spokeswoman Cathy Gurley.
   Williams declined to discuss the incident, other than to say,
``I've always had this strange power over women.''
   Williams wrote and produced the 1973 rock hit, ``Drift Away.''
   Anderson, 41, won a Grammy Award for ``(I Never Promised You a)
Rose Garden'' in 1970, and was a vocalist on television's ``The
Lawrence Welk Show.''

   NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher says the
anxiety he'd expected to feel during the Sept. 29 countdown for the
successful launch of space shuttle Discovery never materialized.
   ``I thought the butterflies were going to be there, but they
weren't,'' he said Wednesday in Pittsburgh, where he received the
Willard F. Rockwell Medal at the 1988 International Congress on
Technology Exchange.
   Fletcher, a physicist, said he will return to the University of
Pittsburgh when he quits the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration next July.

   Actor Joel Grey says 22 years of experience
between award-winning portrayals of the perverse master of
ceremonies in the musical ``Cabaret'' helped make his performance
``lots'' sleazier now.
   ``I think there was something more innocent about the show
then,'' he said at a news conference Thursday to promote the Nov. 1
opening of the touring revival of the show.
   He said that since first appearing in the show, he had a chance
to visit a nightclub in Hamburg, West Germany, that was much more
sinister than the fictional Kit Kat Klub of 1930s Berlin of
``Cabaret.''
   Grey won a Tony as the master of ceremonies in the original
stage version of ``Cabaret'' that opened in New York in 1966, then
won an Academy Award as best supporting actor in 1972 for the same
role in the film version.

   Singer Smokey Robinson, featured in a new
music video that calls attention to a severe eye disease, will be
honored next month by celebrities, including Dick Clark and Ed
McMahon, it was announced.
   The musical tribute set for Nov. 30 is sponsored by the
Retinitis Pigmentosa International, said organization president
Helen Harris.
   Motown Records founder Berry Gordy will co-chair the event with
Clark, while McMahon will be master of ceremonies.
   The song ``Forgotten Eyes,'' written especially for the
retinitis group, will make its debut at the tribute. The affair
will raise money to further research and help victims of retinitis
pigmentosa, a hereditary retinal disease that causes progressive
loss of vision.
   In addition to Robinson, those contributing their voices to the
``Forgotten Eyes'' video include Bob Hope, Dionne Warwick, Herbie
Hancock, Marilyn McCoo, Cheryl Ladd, Angie Dickinson, Sammy Davis
Jr. and Susan Anton.

   A federal court jury acquitted Sasson Jeans
founder Paul Guez of threatening the life of a U.S. bankruptcy
judge.
   The jury deliberated less than two hours before finding Guez
innocent Thursday following a three-day trial in Manhattan.
   Guez was arrested in Manhattan last May 18 after reportedly
threatening the life of Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who was
presiding over the reorganization of Sasson Jeans Inc.
   Lifland later authorized the sale of the Sasson trademark as
part of the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Guez, who spent 28 days at a drug rehabilitation center in
California this past summer, said he was ``very much happy'' with
the verdict.
