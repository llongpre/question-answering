   Be thankful for the low spots and the dull
narration in ``Family Reunion _ A Gospel Music Celebration.''
   Without the low points, the voltage from this musical blowout
might leave viewers writhing on the floor. Television sets might
explode and fires break out across the land.
   ``Family Reunion,'' appearing Saturday on the CBN Cable Network,
offers two hours of hits from some of the biggest names in gospel
music, including the Rev. James Cleveland, the Clark Sisters,
Andrae Crouch, Sandra Crouch, Jessy Dixon, Edwin Hawkins, Thelma
Houston, Billy Preston, Bebe and Cece Winans, and The Mighty Clouds
of Joy.
   What's wrong with the packaging can be summed up in two words:
Dick Clark.
   The ageless record-spinner, planted beside a fireplace, has
little to say about the history or the meaning of gospel music. His
role seems to be to assure the uninitiated that it's OK to listen,
because the Beatles did, too.
   He might have said more about the history of gospel, because a
lot is implied by the songs and the singers. ``Precious Lord,''
sung here by Della Reese, was written in 1931 by Thomas A. Dorsey,
the man who invented gospel.
   Cleveland was a boy soprano in Dorsey's choir at the Pilgrim
Baptist Church in Chicago. In the 1960s, as the ``crown prince of
gospel,'' Cleveland worked with such young people as Billy Preston,
Jessy Dixon and Aretha Franklin.
   Dixon hits one of the program's high points with a bluesy
rendition of Professor Alex Bradford's ``I'm Too Close to Heaven
(and I Can't Turn Around).''
   Cleveland, whose growling voice and dabbing handkerchief recall
Louis Armstrong, comes up next and steals the show with ``Peace, Be
Still.''
   The song was a huge hit in gospel terms, selling 800,000 albums
in the 1960s. It's a dramatic piece in which Cleveland sweats,
shouts, sings and preaches, turning down the volume with a
peremptory ``shhh!'' and then building to another plateau.
   ``Family Reunion'' covers some of the same territory covered
last year with Paul Simon in the Cinemax special, ``Everybody Say
Yeah!'' Andrae Crouch, Jennifer Holliday, the Hawkins Singers and
the Mighty Clouds of Joy appeared on both shows.
   There's even the same quotation from James Baldwin _ ``there is
no music like that music'' _ which, if you think about it, applies
to Lawrence Welk and a lot of other styles, too. But you get the
point.
   High follows high, sometiomes in unexpected places. Hawkins'
familiar hit, ``Oh Happy Day,'' is given some needed rough edges by
the fiery, strutting solo work of Thelma Houston.
   Tramaine Hawkins _ wife of Edwin's brother, Walter _ lights up
the place with ``Changed.''
   Finally, the Crouch who wrecks the house isn't Andrae, but his
sister, Sandra. This regal lady, a hard-working choir director
through much of the show, takes the solo part as she whips a
quartet and chorus through a rousing performance of ``He's Worthy.''
   Amid all the stars, the show's last high point is hit by an
unidentified young woman who steps out of the choir in ``He's
Worthy,'' and she's ready.
   Not only has she picked up a couple of microphone moves from Joe
Ligon of the Mighty Clouds, but she has a huge voice that lifts the
roof. It bodes well for the future of gospel.
