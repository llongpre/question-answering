   The Miss USA beauty pageant got under way
Tuesday evening as 51 contestants flashing bright smiles and
sporting mid-winter tans competed in swimsuits and evening gowns.
   About 3,000 people gathered at Century II's Convention Hall for
the competition by contestants from all 50 states and the District
of Columbia.
   Each category contributes a third of the score that will
determine the 12 finalists, who will be announced Friday in a
national telecast of the pageant on CBS. The other third will come
from personal interviews with an 11-judge panel.
   In Tuesday night's opening, the contestants _ all wearing short,
black cocktail dresses _ sang about being ``right in the middle''
of the United States as they danced and strutted in front of a U.S.
map with Wichita marked with a neon star.
   Contestants said hello to the audience with brief statements,
many of them on their aspirations. Two contestants said they wanted
to someday win the Academy Award for best actress; nearly a dozen
said they are planning careers as broadcast journalists or
television personalities. One contestant who survived an automobile
crash endorsed seat belts.
   In the swimsuit competition, contestants wore identical pink,
one-piece suits. They posed in front of a neon rainbow with puffy
clouds projected behind it as the Top 40 song ``Blame It on The
Rain'' played.
   Two preliminary awards were announced.
   Photographers covering the pageant picked Miss Mississippi-USA
Stephanie TenEyck as 1990's most photogenic delegate. She is a
20-year-old University of Mississippi student from Laurel, Miss.
   Miss Minnesota-USA, Janet Tveita, was selected by a vote of all
the contestants as the nicest, most enthusiastic and friendliest of
the 51 women. She is a 21-year-old from Brooklyn Park, Minn., and
attends North Hennepin Community College.
   Judges for this year's pageant include former Olympian and
professional ice skater Robin Cousins and retired astronaut Gordon
Cooper.
   The pageant finals hosts will be Dick Clark and Leeza Gibbons,
co-host of the syndicated television show ``Entertainment Tonight.''
