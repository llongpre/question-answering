Monty Hall has made his last deal. 
</P>
<P>
The creator and original host of "Let's Make a Deal" will not resume his duties 
when the show returns to NBC's daytime lineup this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I did 4,500 episodes and I'm looking for new fields to conquer," Hall said 
Tuesday. "I am committed to finding the new host, and will teach him. I'm also 
going to pop up on the show from time to time as a surprise guest." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the best advice he could give his successor was "to love the people." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wild show and you can't allow yourself to be turned off," Hall said. 
"You have to keep your sense of equilibrium and treat your guests with 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who created the series along with partner Stefan Hatos, remains as 
half-owner of the series. The new series will be a production of dick clark 
productions, inc., in association with Ron Greenberg Productions. "Let's Make a 
Deal" will be taped in Orlando, Fla., at the Disney/MGM Studios Theme Park as 
part of a permanent attraction at the amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Make a Deal" premiered in December, 1963, on the NBC daytime lineup, 
where it ran until 1968, when it switched to ABC, continuing until 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 64, is currently doing commercials and guest appearances, with much of 
his time spent performing his duties as the International Chairman of Variety 
Clubs International, one of the world's largest children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
A former sportscaster, Hall said he has been approached to co-host a sports 
show with his son Richard. Hall said he has also been asked to host several 
proposed game shows, an idea he said he is not opposed to. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be as exciting as "Let's Make a Deal,"" Hall said. "I 
wouldn't just want to be a traffic cop type of host, but the kind of host where 
I would get to perform 30 minutes a day. When 'Let's Make a Deal' was over, you 
knew you were through a half hour." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Make a Deal" also had the distinction, along with "The Newlywed Game," 
of being the last prime-time network TV game show during a 1969-71 run on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The show was also syndicated from 1971-76 and revived in 1980 and 1984.
